    "title": "Systems and methods to detect rare mutations and copy number variation",
    "abstract": "The present disclosure provides a system and method for the detection of rare mutations and copy number variations in cell free polynucleotides. Generally, the systems and methods comprise sample preparation, or the extraction and isolation of cell free polynucleotide sequences from a bodily fluid; subsequent sequencing of cell free polynucleotides by techniques known in the art; and application of bioinformatics tools to detect rare mutations and copy number variations as compared to a reference. The systems and methods also may contain a database or collection of different rare mutations or copy number variation profiles of different diseases, to be used as additional references in aiding detection of rare mutations, copy number variation profiling or general genetic profiling of a disease.",
    "function": [
        "What is the essential function of the product or process?",
        " The essential function of the patented system and method is to detect and quantify rare mutations, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels, copy number variations (CNVs), and other genomic alterations in cell-free DNA from bodily fluids, using a combination of sample preparation, sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and reference sequence comparison. This enables the identification of tumor markers and genetic profiling for disease diagnosis or monitoring"

    "operation": [
        "How does the product or process operate?",
        " The patented system and method operate by extracting cell-free DNA from a bodily fluid, tagging it with barcodes, amplifying the tagged DNA, sequencing it to produce sequence reads, grouping the reads based on barcode and sequence information, comparing them to reference sequences to identify consensus sequences, and quantifying rare mutations like single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or copy number variations (CNVs) in the cell-free DNA. This enables disease"

    "results": [
        "What results does this product or process achieve?",
        " The patented system and method achieve the detection and quantification of rare mutations, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels, copy number variations (CNVs), and other genomic alterations in cell-free DNA from bodily fluids. This enables the identification of tumor markers and genetic profiling for disease diagnosis or monitoring. The method also allows for the comparison of sequence reads to reference sequences, identification of consensus sequences, calculation of variant frequencies"

        "What ingredients, materials, or processes are alternatives that can work in the same way?",
        " Alternative methods may include:\n1. Different tagging techniques, such as unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) or molecular barcodes.\n2. Various sequencing technologies, like Sanger sequencing or next-generation sequencing platforms other than Illumina.\n3. Alternative bioinformatics tools for sequence alignment, variant calling, and consensus sequence determination.\n4. Different sample preparation methods, such as using different en"
