    "title": "Method for presenting advertising in an interactive service",
    "abstract": "A method for presenting advertising in an interactive service provided on a computer network, the service featuring applications which include pre-created, interactive text/graphic sessions is described. The method features steps for presenting advertising concurrently with service applications at the user terminal configured as a reception system. In accordance with the method, the advertising is structured in a manner comparable to the service applications enabling the applications to be presented at a first portion of a display associated with the reception system and the advertising presented at a second portion. Further, steps are provided for storing and managing advertising at the user reception system so that advertising can be pre-fetched from the network and staged in anticipation of being called for presentation. This minimizes the potential for communication line interference between application and advertising traffic and makes the advertising available at the reception system so as not to delay presentation of the service applications. Yet further the method features steps for individualizing the advertising supplied to enhance potential user interest by providing advertising based on a characterization of the user as defined by the users interaction with the service, user demographics and geographical location. Yet additionally, advertising is provided with transactional facilities so that users can interact with it.",
    "function": [
        "What is the essential function of the product or process?",
        " The essential function of this patented method is to present advertising in an interactive service on a computer network, structured and stored in a way that allows it to be selectively supplied and presented concurrently with user-requested applications. This method also includes characterizing users based on their interactions, demographics, and geographical location to tailor the advertising content, enhancing user interest and interaction. Additionally, it incorporates transactional facilities for user interaction with the ads."
