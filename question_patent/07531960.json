    "title": "Light emitting device with blue light LED and phosphor components",
    "abstract": "A light emitting device includes a light emitting component; and a phosphor capable of absorbing a part of light emitted by the light emitting component and emitting light of a wavelength different from that of the absorbed light. A straight line connecting a point of chromaticity corresponding to a peak of the spectrum generated by the light emitting component and a point of chromaticity corresponding to a peak of the spectrum generated by the phosphor is disposed along with the black body radiation locus in the chromaticity diagram.",
    "function": [
        "What is the essential function of the product or process?",
        " The essential function of this light emitting device is to produce white light by combining blue light emitted from a gallium nitride-based semiconductor with different wavelengths of light emitted by phosphors, creating overlapping spectra that result in white light. The device achieves this through varying phosphor concentrations and arrangements, as well as specific material choices for the semiconductor and phosphors."

    "operation": [
        "How does the product or process operate?",
        " The light emitting device operates by combining blue light emitted from a gallium nitride-based semiconductor with different wavelengths of light emitted by phosphors. These phosphors absorb part of the blue light and emit secondary light at longer wavelengths. The overlapping spectra of the unabsorbed blue light and the secondary light create white light. The concentration and arrangement of phosphors can be controlled to optimize the color"

    "results": [
        "What results does this product or process achieve?",
        " The light emitting device achieves the production of white light by combining blue light emitted from a gallium nitride-based semiconductor with different wavelengths of light emitted by phosphors. This is accomplished through varying phosphor concentrations and arrangements, as well as specific material choices for the semiconductor and phosphors. The device can produce consistent emission colors and maintain a constant spectrum, even when using components with different emission wavelength"

    "alternatives": [
        "What ingredients, materials, or processes are alternatives that can work in the same way?",
        " Alternative materials and configurations for the light emitting device could include:\n\n1. Different semiconductor materials: Using alternative semiconductors like aluminum gallium indium phosphide (AlGaInP) or zinc selenide (ZnSe) instead of gallium nitride (GaN).\n2. Various phosphor types: Employing different phosphor materials, such as strontium aluminate"
