    "title": "Mineral wool insulation",
    "abstract": "A method of manufacturing a mineral fiber thermal insulation product comprises the sequential steps of: Forming mineral fibers from a molten mineral mixture; spraying a substantially formaldehyde free binder solution on to the mineral fibers, the binder solution comprising: a reducing sugar, an acid precursor derivable from an inorganic salt and a source of nitrogen; Collecting the mineral fibers to which the binder solution has been applied to form a batt of mineral fibers; and Curing the batt comprising the mineral fibers and the binder which is in contact with the mineral fibers by passing the batt through a curing oven so as to provide a batt of mineral fibers held together by a substantially water insoluble cured binder.",
    "function": [
        "What is the essential function of the product or process?",
        " The essential function of the product or process described in the patent is to manufacture a glass fiber thermal insulation product with specific properties, such as a high glass fiber content (>80% by weight), low density (>5 kg/m\u00b3), and controlled thermal conductivity (\u03bb < 0.05 W/mK and > 0.02 W/mK). The process involves forming glass fibers from a molten mineral mixture, sp"

        "How does the product or process operate?",
        " The product or process described in the patent involves a method for manufacturing glass fiber thermal insulation products with specific properties. The essential function of this process is to create a high-quality, formaldehyde-free, nitrogenous polymer-containing binder that holds together glass fibers to form an insulating batt.\n\nThe process begins by forming glass fibers from a molten mineral mixture. These fibers are then sprayed with a substantially"
