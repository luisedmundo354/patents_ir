    "title": "Spring lock interface engagement system",
    "abstract": "An engagement system having a spring lock design to initially attach the two halves of the system together. After which the use of a multi start Acme lead screw provides a, consistent, low torque means of engagement. Although the engager requires the use of lubrication, to be applied initially, the lube is contained in a sealed environment. This eliminates the risk of contamination to electrical components and eliminates the need to apply additional lube during the products life. Because the present invention allows the ACME threads to be \u201cmeshed\u201d at all times, it also eliminates the possibly of cross-threading.",
