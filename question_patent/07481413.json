    "title": "Flush actuator assembly and method therefor",
    "abstract": "A flush actuator assembly is adapted to fit existing valve bodies. The flush actuator assembly includes a plunger rod which is capable of displacing the relief valve post more or less to adjust the flow of water through the flush valve during a single flush. The relief valve post may be displaced different amounts by adjusting the actuator assembly such that the plunger rod contacts the relief valve post at different locations along the central longitudinal axis of the post. Additionally, the relief valve post may be displaced different amounts by providing a plunger rod that has a different range of travel. A method associated with displacing the relief valve post varying amounts is also disclosed.",
    "function": [
        "What is the essential function of the product or process?",
        " The essential function of the flush actuator assembly and method is to adjust the volume of water passing through a flush valve during a single flush cycle by displacing the relief valve post to varying degrees, using a plunger rod with visual indicia for calibration. Alternative materials or processes could include different types of guiding mechanisms, seals, or visual indicia methods."

    "operation": [
        "How does the product or process operate?",
        " The flush actuator assembly and method operate by adjusting the volume of water passing through a flush valve during a single flush cycle. This is achieved by displacing the relief valve post using a plunger rod, which is moved back and forth within a base bore via a handle. Visual indicia on the assembly guide the positioning of the plunger rod, altering its contact point with the relief valve post, thus varying water flow. A spring may bias the pl"

    "results": [
        "What results does this product or process achieve?",
        " The flush actuator assembly and method adjust the water flow volume during a single flush cycle by varying the displacement of the relief valve post, allowing for customizable and efficient water usage in flushing applications."
    ],
    "alternatives": [
        "What ingredients, materials, or processes are alternatives that can work in the same way?",
        " Alternative materials or processes could include different types of guiding mechanisms for the plunger rod, such as ball bearings or rollers, alternative sealing arrangements like O-rings or gaskets, and various visual indicia methods like color-coded markings or digital displays. The drive mechanism could also be replaced with a motorized system for automatic adjustments."
