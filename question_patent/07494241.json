    "title": "Selectively-extendable modular lighting fixture and method",
    "abstract": "A modular, linear-type lighting fixture may include an elongate housing having lengthwise ends, and a pair of endplates adapted for sealing attachment to either lengthwise end of the housing, each of the endplates having respective perimeter surfaces adapted for attachment to any one of a bridge adapted for angularly-directable extension of the housing, a bridge adapted for linear extension of the housing, and an endcap. A modular lighting fixture may include first and second elongate housings each having ends, pairs of endplates for being respectively mated with the first and second ends of the first and second elongate housings, the endplates each having a rim, and a bridge adapted for joining one of the endplates of the first elongate housing with one of the endplates of the second elongate housing by sealing cooperation with the respective rims thereof. A lighting fixture may have one or more isolated raceways therein.",
    "function": [
        "What is the essential function of the product or process?",
        " The essential function of this selectively-extendable modular lighting fixture is to provide a customizable, adaptable lighting solution. It allows for the extension of the lighting fixture in various configurations (angularly or linearly) using interchangeable components (bridges or endcaps), enabling users to adjust the length and direction of the light output according to their specific needs. This system offers flexibility, ease of installation, and efficient space utilization."
    ],
    "operation": [
        "How does the product or process operate?",
        " The selectively-extendable modular lighting fixture operates by allowing users to customize and adapt the lighting system according to their specific needs. It consists of elongate housings, endplates, and additional structures (bridges or endcaps) that can be connected to extend the housing linearly or angularly. Users can attach various configurations of bridges or endcaps to adjust the length and direction of the light output, providing flexibility, ease of installation,"

    "alternatives": [
        "What ingredients, materials, or processes are alternatives that can work in the same way?",
        " Alternative materials for the housing, endplates, and additional structures could include various plastics, metals, or composites with similar properties (e.g., strength, durability, and light transmission). Alternative fastening methods might involve snap-fit connections, adhesives, or magnetic attachments. The bridge and endcap designs could be adapted to accommodate different connection types while maintaining the same functionality."
