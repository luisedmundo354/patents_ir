    "abstract": "A bracket is configured to be coupled to a support surface and configured to support a roller window shade assembly. The bracket comprises a side configured to bear against the support surface such that the bracket extends away from the support surface and is adjacent an end of the roller window shade assembly. A passage extends through the bracket from the side to an area of the bracket adjacent the roller window shade assembly. The passage is configured to receive electrical wiring therethrough such that the electrical wiring can pass from the support surface to the roller window shade assembly to power a motor of the roller window shade assembly, and the bracket is configured to obscure the electrical wiring when the bracket is coupled to the support surface and supports the roller window shade assembly.",
