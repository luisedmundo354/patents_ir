    "title": "Mounting bracket",
    "abstract": "An improved mounting bracket that provides an indication to an installer when a mount is not correctly aligned. The mounting bracket comprises a mounting contact portion and at least one side portion integrally connected to the mounting contact portion, with the at least one side portion defining a receiving region for accepting one or more retaining portions of a mount. The at least one side portion includes a first ramped surface at least partially outside of the receiving region. The first ramped surface configured to contact a retaining portion when the retaining portion is misaligned with the receiving region, thereby informing an installer of the misalignment.",
    "function": [
        "What is the essential function of the product or process?",
        " The essential function of the mounting bracket is to securely attach a mount, such as a device or panel, to a surface while providing an indication to an installer when the mount is misaligned during installation. This is achieved through the use of side portions with ramped surfaces that contact retaining portions of the mount when misaligned, and guiding surfaces that assist in proper positioning."

    "operation": [
        "How does the product or process operate?",
        " The mounting bracket operates by securing a mount to a surface. It has side portions with ramped surfaces that contact retaining portions of the mount when misaligned, indicating improper positioning. A guiding surface assists in correct alignment. The bracket can have hooks or ramped surfaces outside the receiving region to accommodate misalignment and guide positioning. Side portions may be separate or part of a single component, and multiple configurations exist"
