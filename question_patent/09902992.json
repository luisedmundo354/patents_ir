    "title": "Systems and methods to detect rare mutations and copy number variation",
    "abstract": "The present disclosure provides a system and method for the detection of rare mutations and copy number variations in cell free polynucleotides. Generally, the systems and methods comprise sample preparation, or the extraction and isolation of cell free polynucleotide sequences from a bodily fluid; subsequent sequencing of cell free polynucleotides by techniques known in the art; and application of bioinformatics tools to detect rare mutations and copy number variations as compared to a reference. The systems and methods also may contain a database or collection of different rare mutations or copy number variation profiles of different diseases, to be used as additional references in aiding detection of rare mutations, copy number variation profiling or general genetic profiling of a disease.",
    "function": [
        "What is the essential function of the product or process?",
        " The essential function of this patented system and method is to detect rare genetic mutations and copy number variations in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) molecules from a bodily fluid, using unique or non-unique barcode tagging, amplification, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis. This enables the identification of various genetic aberrations associated with diseases at a high sensitivity and specificity."

    "operation": [
        "How does the product or process operate?",
        " The patented system and method operate by detecting rare genetic mutations and copy number variations in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) molecules from a bodily fluid. This is achieved through sample preparation, which includes extracting and isolating cfDNA sequences from the fluid. The cfDNA molecules are then tagged with barcodes containing different sequences, amplified, sequenced, and analyzed using bioinformatics tools. The process involves mapping sequence"
