    "title": "Flush valve handle assembly providing dual mode operation",
    "abstract": "A dual mode flush valve includes a handle assembly having a handle, a bushing and a plunger. The bushing has a sleeve with a passage therethrough for mounting the plunger for sliding and tilting. The passage is defined by first and second partially overlapping bores that coincide at the inner end of the sleeve and are spaced one above the other at the outer end of the sleeve. The bores define a horizontal plunger travel axis and an angled plunger travel axis. Depending on which direction the user actuates the handle the plunger will travel along one of these axes. Travel along the angled axis will lower the plunger tip, allowing earlier clearance of a relief valve and a reduced flow through the flush valve compared to actuation with the plunger travel along the horizontal axis.",
    "function": [
        "What is the essential function of the product or process?",
        " The essential function is to provide a dual-mode flush valve that allows for adjustable water flow control, enabling the release of different volumes of water through distinct plunger travel axes, achieved by tilting and sliding the handle-connected plunger."
    ],
    "operation": [
        "How does the product or process operate?",
        " The flush valve operates by allowing the user to adjust water flow through dual-mode functionality. By tilting and sliding a handle-connected plunger, the user can control the volume of water released. Tilting in one direction engages a horizontal plunger travel axis for a standard flush, while tilting in another direction engages an angled axis for a reduced flow, providing two distinct flush volumes. This is achieved through the unique design of the bushing passage and"

    "results": [
        "What results does this product or process achieve?",
        " The product achieves dual-mode operation, allowing users to select between two distinct flush volumes. This is accomplished through a unique handle-plunger mechanism that enables the plunger to travel along different axes (horizontal and angled) depending on the handle's tilt direction. The result is water conservation and user control over flush volume, providing both standard and reduced flow options for different needs or preferences."

    "alternatives": [
        "What ingredients, materials, or processes are alternatives that can work in the same way?",
        " Alternative materials for the bushing and plunger could include various plastics, metals, or composites. The handle assembly might be replaced with a lever or button mechanism. The relief valve could be designed with different geometries or actuation methods (e.g., solenoid-operated). The bushing passage shape can be achieved through machining, injection molding, or 3D printing processes."
