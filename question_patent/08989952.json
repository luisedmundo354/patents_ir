    "title": "System and method for detecting vehicle crash",
    "abstract": "A device is provided for use with a vehicle. The device includes a mode-determining component, a first detecting component and a second detecting component. The mode-determining component can generate an in-vehicle signal. The first detecting component can detect a first parameter and can generate a first detector signal based on the first detected parameter. The second detecting component can detect a second parameter and can generate a second detector signal based on the second detected parameter. The mode-determining component can further generate a crash mode signal based on the in-vehicle signal, the first detector signal and the second detector signal.",
    "function": [
        "What is the essential function of the product or process?",
        " The essential function of the patented vehicle crash detection system is to identify a vehicle crash event by analyzing various parameters such as acceleration, magnetic fields, and airbag deployment. It generates a crash mode signal based on these parameters, which can be used to trigger safety measures like automatic emergency calls or airbag deployment."
    ],
    "operation": [
        "How does the product or process operate?",
        " The patented vehicle crash detection system operates by using a mode-determining component to detect if it's in the vehicle and generate an in-vehicle signal. Two detecting components measure parameters like acceleration, magnetic fields, or airbag deployment. These measurements are used to create detector signals. If the signals meet certain criteria (e.g., acceleration above a threshold), a crash mode signal is generated, which can trigger safety measures like emergency calls or airbag deployment"

    "results": [
        "What results does this product or process achieve?",
        " The patented vehicle crash detection system achieves the identification of a vehicle crash event by analyzing various parameters such as acceleration, magnetic fields, and airbag deployment. It generates a crash mode signal based on these parameters, which can be used to trigger safety measures like automatic emergency calls or airbag deployment. This helps in providing timely assistance and potentially reducing the severity of injuries during a crash."

    "alternatives": [
        "What ingredients, materials, or processes are alternatives that can work in the same way?",
        " Alternative components or methods for detecting vehicle crashes could include:\n\n1. Different types of sensors: Accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, pressure sensors, or microphones could be used to detect changes in acceleration, orientation, magnetic fields, air pressure, or sound that indicate a crash.\n2. Machine learning algorithms: Advanced algorithms could analyze sensor data to identify patterns associated with crashes and generate a crash mode signal accordingly.\n3."
