    "title": "Shade bracket with concealed wiring",
    "abstract": "A bracket is configured to be coupled to a support surface and configured to support a roller window shade assembly. The bracket comprises a side configured to bear against the support surface such that the bracket extends away from the support surface and is adjacent an end of the roller window shade assembly. A passage extends through the bracket from the side to an area of the bracket adjacent the roller window shade assembly. The passage is configured to receive electrical wire therethrough such that the electrical wire can pass from the support surface to the roller window shade assembly to power a motor of the roller window shade assembly, and the bracket is configured to obscure the electrical wire when the bracket is coupled to the support surface and supports the roller window shade assembly.",
    "function": [
        "What is the essential function of the product or process?",
        " The essential function of the shade bracket with concealed wiring is to securely mount a roller window shade assembly to a support surface while providing a hidden pathway for electrical wiring that powers the shade's motor, ensuring both functionality and aesthetics."
    ],
    "operation": [
        "How does the product or process operate?",
        " The shade bracket with concealed wiring operates by securely mounting a roller window shade assembly to a support surface, such as a wall or window frame. The bracket has a side that engages the support surface, extending away from it and holding the roller window shade assembly. A passage within the bracket allows electrical wiring to pass from the support surface to the motor of the roller window shade assembly, powering it while remaining hidden for"

    "alternatives": [
        "What ingredients, materials, or processes are alternatives that can work in the same way?",
        " Alternative materials for the shade bracket could include various metals (e.g., aluminum, steel), plastics, or composites that provide sufficient strength and durability while maintaining aesthetics. The electrical wiring pathway could be achieved using alternative conduit materials such as PVC, metal tubing, or flexible cable channels. The projection limiting rotation of the roller window shade assembly could be implemented using alternative designs like adjustable arms or"
