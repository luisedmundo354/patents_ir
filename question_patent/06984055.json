    "title": "Selectively-extendable modular lighting fixture and method",
    "abstract": "A modular, linear-type lighting fixture may include an elongate housing having lengthwise ends, and a pair of endplates adapted for sealing attachment to either lengthwise end of the housing, each of the endplates having respective perimeter surfaces adapted for attachment to any one of a bridge adapted for angularly-directable extension of the housing, a bridge adapted for linear extension of the housing, and an endcap. A modular lighting fixture may include first and second elongate housings each having ends, pairs of endplates for being respectively mated with the first and second ends of the first and second elongate housings, the endplates each having a rim, and a bridge adapted for joining one of the endplates of the first elongate housing with one of the endplates of the second elongate housing by sealing cooperation with the respective rims thereof. A lighting fixture may have one or more isolated raceways therein.",
    "function": [
        "What is the essential function of the product or process?",
        " The essential function of this modular lighting fixture is to provide a flexible, customizable lighting solution that allows for easy extension, reconfiguration, and maintenance. It enables the connection of multiple lighting units in various configurations while maintaining a sealed and isolated internal raceway system for electrical wiring. The design also allows for the integration of lenses and other components to enhance light distribution and aesthetics."

    "operation": [
        "How does the product or process operate?",
        " The modular lighting fixture operates by allowing easy extension, reconfiguration, and maintenance of a linear-type lighting system. It consists of elongate housings with endplates that can be sealed to either end. These endplates have perimeter surfaces adapted for attachment to an angularly-directable bridge, a ring, or an endcap. The bridge enables angular extension of the housing, while the ring allows for linear extension. This design facilitates customizable light"
