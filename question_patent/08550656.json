    "title": "Selectively-extendable modular lighting fixture",
    "abstract": "A modular lighting fixture may include a housing having opposite ends, an endplate for fastening to one end of the housing, the endplate having a lens receiving face on a first side and an additional-structure-connecting face on a second side. The second side has an outer perimeter portion and a first peripheral surface, the first peripheral surface being inward of the outer perimeter portion. An additional structure is provided having a second peripheral surface with substantially similar contour as the first peripheral surface on the second side of the endplate. The additional structure is connected to the endplate with the second peripheral surface being proximate to the first peripheral surface of the second side of the endplate. A modular lighting fixture may include first and second elongate housings each having ends, pairs of endplates for being respectively mated with the first and second ends of the first and second elongate housings, the endplates each having a rim, and a bridge adapted for joining one of the endplates of the first elongate housing with one of the endplates of the second elongate housing by sealing cooperation with the respective rims thereof. A lighting fixture may have one or more isolated raceways therein.",
    "function": [
        "What is the essential function of the product or process?",
        " The essential function of the selectively-extendable modular lighting fixture is to provide adjustable, directional lighting by securely attaching a lens to an elongate housing, which can be extended linearly or angularly using interchangeable bridges or endcaps, while maintaining a snug fit and sealing integrity between the components."
    ],
    "operation": [
        "How does the product or process operate?",
        " The selectively-extendable modular lighting fixture operates by attaching a lens to an elongate housing, which can be extended linearly or angularly using interchangeable bridges or endcaps. The housing has downwardly-opening grooves that align with the endplates' grooves, securing the lens in place. Bridges and endcaps provide extension options while maintaining a snug fit and sealing integrity"

    "results": [
        "What results does this product or process achieve?",
        " The selectively-extendable modular lighting fixture provides adjustable, directional lighting with secure attachment and sealing of the lens to the housing. It allows for linear or angular extension using interchangeable bridges or endcaps, ensuring a snug fit and maintaining integrity between components. The design also includes gaskets for sealing and preventing external access to certain parts of the lens."

    "alternatives": [
        "What ingredients, materials, or processes are alternatives that can work in the same way?",
        " Alternative materials and designs may include:\n1. Different housing materials, such as plastic or metal alloys, with similar groove configurations for lens attachment.\n2. Various lens attachment mechanisms like screws, clips, or magnets instead of bridges and endcaps.\n3. Adjustable arms or telescopic poles for extending the lighting fixture's reach.\n4. Modular connectors with interchangeable"
