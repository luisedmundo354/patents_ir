      "Patent Name: Ring binder mechanism spring biased to a locked position when ring members close\n",
      "Patent Number: 07404685\n",
      "Patent Abstract: A ring binder mechanism that retains loose-leaf pages and has ring members that gently close and readily lock together. The mechanism comprises a housing that supports two hinge plates for loose pivoting motion, moving the ring members between an open position and a closed position. A control structure is movable by an actuating lever, which is pivotally mounted on the housing, between a first and second position. In the first position, pivoting motion of the hinge plates is blocked, and in the second position, the hinge plates can freely pivot. A spring is engageable with the lever for urging the lever to move the control structure toward the first position.\n",
