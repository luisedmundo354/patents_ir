        "Referring to FIGS. 1-4, in one embodiment the multi-compartment dispensing assembly 10 includes: (a) a housing 12 which includes a bottom dispensing compartment 14 and a side dispensing compartment 16; (b) a door 18 which covers part or all of the compartments 14 and 16 when closed; and (c) a plurality of picture-type hang mounts, hangers or hang mounts 20 connected to the rear wall 22 of the housing 12.",
        "The bottom dispensing compartment 14 holds a plurality of disposable towels 24 or a disposable towel unit 26. Likewise, the side dispensing compartment 16 holds a plurality of disposable towels 28 or a disposable towel unit 30. The bottom dispensing compartment 14 includes a plurality of retaining walls 32 connected to a bottom wall 34. The bottom wall 34 includes an outlet wall 36 which defines a chute or outlet 38. In one embodiment, the outlet wall 36 has an elongated slot shape including a plurality of side portions 40 and a central portion 42. Each side portion 40 has a rounded rectangular configuration, and the central portion 42 has a partially circular or circular configuration. The width 44 of the central portion 42 is greater than the width 46 of each of the side portions 40. This assists users in accessing the paper towels 24 to pull a paper towel 24 through the outlet 38. For example, the width 44 can be sized to enable a user to insert a portion of his or her fingers through the outlet 38 to reach a paper towel 24. It should be appreciated that the outlet 38 can include a configuration of variable widths, and the portion with the greater width can be located at any suitable location along the outlet wall 36.",
        "The side dispensing compartment 16 includes a plurality of retaining walls 48, 50, 52 and 54, and the side dispensing compartment 16 includes a bottom wall 56. The retaining wall 50 includes an outlet wall 58 which defines a side outlet 60. The side outlet 60 is illustrated as having a circular configuration, though it should be understood that the side outlet 60 can have any suitable configuration.",
        "The door 18 has a substantially flat or a flat configuration as illustrated in FIGS. 1-4. As such, when the door 18 is in the closed position 62, as illustrated in FIG. 1, the door 18 functions a shelf or shelving surface. Accordingly, the door 18 has a shelf surface 19. This enable users to store or rest a plurality of shelvable items 64 on the multi-compartment dispensing assembly 10. In the example illustrated in FIGS. 1-4, the door 18 is configured to fit within the perimeter recess 66 defined by the exterior housing walls 68 and the retaining walls 32, 48, 50, 52 and 54. Accordingly, in this example, the door 18 has no hinges or connectors which would mechanically couple the door 18 to the housing 12. Put another way, the door 18 is hingelessly carried by the housing 12 in a slot-groove configuration. As such, the user can insert the door 18 into the perimeter recess 66 to close the door 18, and the user can open the door 18 by removing the door 18 from the perimeter recess 66. In the example illustrated, the door 18 has a door grasp member 70 which assists users in grasping the door 18. In this example, the door grasp member 70 includes a grasp wall 72 which defines a void or recess. 74. When the door 18 is in the closed position 62, the user can insert his or her fingers through the recess 74, apply a force to the underside of the door 14 and remove the door 14 from the housing 12. It should be appreciated that the grasp wall 72 can define any suitable void including, but not limited to, an opening, slot, cut-away or irregularity. In addition, the door 18 can include any suitable member or device which assists users in grasping or handling the door 18 including, but not limited to, a knob, stud, ridge, raised portion or irregularity.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4, the hang mounts 20 enable users to hang the assembly 10 on a building or room wall (not shown) without having to access the compartments 14 and 16. In the example illustrated, the hang mounts 20 each include: (a) a wall or plate 76 which defines a fastener head opening 78; and (b) a plurality of fasteners 80 which couple the plate 76 to the rear wall 22. The rear wall 22 defines a plurality of mount cavities or recesses 75, each of which is sized to receive the plate 76. The configuration of the plates 76 and the recesses 76 define a space (not shown) which enables the heads of fasteners to be located underneath the plates 76. To hang the assembly 10 on a wall, the user can screw two screw fasteners into a wall with the heads of the screws protruding from the wall. Next, the user aligns the head openings 78 with the heads of the screws and slides the screws into the slots 82. Since the slots 82 are smaller than the head openings 78, the heads of the screws are locked in place, and the assembly 10 is mounted to the wall. With this function of the hang mounts 20, the assembly 10 is a hang-able assembly 10, providing additional convenience to users.",
        "In another embodiment illustrated in FIG. 5, the multi-compartment dispensing assembly 100 includes: (a) a housing 102 which includes a bottom dispensing compartment 104 and a side dispensing compartment 106; (b) a door 108 which, in this example, is the same as the door 18 of assembly 10; and (c) a plurality of hanger mounts in the rear wall which, in this example, are the same as the hang mounts 20 and rear wall 22 of assembly 10. In this embodiment, the bottom dispensing compartment 104 holds a towel roll 110 which includes a plurality of perforated towels 112. The bottom dispensing compartment 104 includes: (a) a plurality of retaining walls 114; (b) a bottom wall 116 connected to the retaining walls 114; (c) an axle, rod, tube, pipe or cylindrically shaped or elongated support member 118 which is received by the inner tube (not shown) of the towel roll 110; and (d) an elongated outlet director 120 connected to the retaining walls 114 which directs each towel 112 toward the bottom outlet which is similar in shape and position as the outlet 38 of the assembly 10.",
        "The shaft or roller tube 118 includes a plurality of slot engagers or followers 119, and the retaining walls 114(a) and 114(b) each define a vertical slot 121 which receives each follower 119. Accordingly, the user can install and remove the towel roll 110 by upwardly sliding the roller tube 118 through the slots 121, removing the roller tube 118 from the compartment 104, inserting the roller tube 118 into the roller tube 118 and downwardly sliding the roller tube 118 through the slots 121.
