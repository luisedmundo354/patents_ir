        "This application claims priority to German Patent Application No. 10 2004 020 479.9, filed Apr. 26, 2004.",
        "An ever-increasing number of applications of LCDs, for example for use in automobiles, in which a temperature range of from \u221240\u00b0 C. to 100\u00b0 C. can quite possibly exist, but also portable units such as cellphones and notebook PCs, requires liquid-crystal mixtures which have firstly a very wide working temperature range and secondly a very low threshold voltage.",
        "There is therefore a continuing demand for novel, suitable liquid-crystal mixtures and mixture components. As described in Ichinose et al. (IDW'00, Abstr. LCT4-3) or in DE-A 100 50 071, materials are being sought in which there is coexistence of high optical anisotropy (\u0394n) and low rotational viscosity, although other parameters, for example high absolute values of dielectric anisotropy (\u0394\u03b5), are likewise preferentially required, in addition to further parameters relevant to the application.",
        "1- and/or 8-fluorinated fluorenes having substituents in the 2 and 7 positions are known as components of liquid-crystal mixtures from WO 02/079344, WO 02/055463 and WO 01/010803.",
        "Since the manufacturers of liquid-crystal displays, though, have a constant interest in improved liquid-crystal mixtures, there is still a need for further components of liquid-crystal mixtures, with which individual parameters relevant to the application, for example the dielectric anisotropy (\u0394\u03b5) or the optical anisotropy (\u0394n), may be optimized.",
        "It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide novel components for use in nematic or cholesteric or chiral-smectic liquid-crystal mixtures which have high absolute values of dielectric anisotropy combined with a favorable ratio of viscosity to clearing point. In addition, the compounds should to a high degree preferably be light- and UV-stable, and also thermally stable. In addition, they should preferably be suitable for realizing a high voltage holding ratio (VHR). In addition, they should preferably have good synthetic accessibility and therefore potentially be inexpensive.",
        "The objects are achieved in accordance with the invention by compounds of the formula (I)",

        "The provision of compounds of the formula (I) in a quite general sense considerably broadens the range of liquid-crystalline substances which are suitable for producing liquid-crystalline mixtures from different performance aspects.",
        "In this context, the compounds of the formula (I) have a broad field of application. Depending on the selection of the substituents, they may be added to other classes of compound, in order, for example, to influence the dielectric and/or optical anisotropy of such a dielectric. They may also serve to optimize its threshold voltage and/or its viscosity. The compounds may also serve to increase the mesophase range or to adjust individual mesophases to parameters relevant to the application.",
        "The compounds of the formula (I) are particularly suitable, even in small amounts in the mixture, for influencing the dielectric anisotropy (\u0394\u03b5) and/or the optical anisotropy \u0394n of liquid-crystal mixtures. The compounds of the formula (I) are particularly suitable, even in small amounts in the mixture, for reducing the response time of ferroelectric liquid-crystal mixtures. The compounds of the formula (I) are likewise particularly suitable for adjusting the broadness of the SC or N phase to application requirements.",
        "The present invention thus provides compounds of the formula (I) and for the use of these compounds as components of liquid-crystalline mixtures and liquid-crystalline mixtures comprising one or more compounds of the formula (I).",
        "The compounds of the formula (I) may be used in various liquid-crystal mixtures, for example chiral-smectic, nematic or cholesteric liquid-crystal mixtures. In the case of nematic mixtures, they are particularly suitable for active matrix displays (AM-LCD) (see, for example, C. Prince, Seminar Lecture Notes, Volume I, p.

L\u00fcder, Recent Progress of AMLCD's, Proceedings of the 15th International Display Research Conference, 1995, p. 9-12) and in-plane-switching displays (IPS-LCD), and, in the case of smectic liquid-crystal mixtures, for smectic (ferroelectric or antiferroelectric) displays. Further display possibilities are the ECB and VA display mode in the case of nematic and cholesteric LC mixtures.",
        "Further components of liquid-crystal mixtures which comprise inventive compounds of the formula (I) are preferably selected from the known compounds having smectic and/or nematic and/or cholesteric phases.

        "The present invention therefore also provides liquid-crystal mixtures, which comprise at least one compound of the formula (I), preferably in an amount of from 1 to 40% by weight, based on the liquid-crystal mixture. The mixtures preferably comprise at least 3 further components of smectic and/or nematic and/or cholesteric phases in addition to compounds of the formula (I). The invention additionally provides electrooptical display elements (liquid-crystal displays) which comprise the inventive mixtures.",

        "The inventive displays are typically constructed in such a way that one liquid-crystal layer is enclosed on both sides by layers which are typically, in this sequence starting from the LC layer, at least one alignment layer, electrodes and a boundary layer (for example of glass). In addition, they may comprise spacers, adhesive frames, polarizers and thin color filter layers for color displays. Further possible components are antireflection, passivation, compensation and barrier layers, and also electrically nonlinear elements such as thin-film transistors (TFT) and metal-insulator-metal (MIM) elements. The construction of liquid-crystal displays has already been described in detail in relevant monographs (see, for example, E.
