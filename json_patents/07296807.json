    "abstract": "The use of a pivotal coupling on a cart of the wheelbarrow type allows for a downwardly applied pressure to the user ends of the handles to tip the bucket to at least begin the dumping action of the cart. Following the initial downward pressure with the handles still elevationally displaced downward an upward lift applied to the user ends of the handles completes the dumping action of the cart. Use of multiple pivotal axises on the cart provide for an extremely efficient operation. Various enhancements are explained including locking of the orientation of the cart following the initial dump, wheel blocking to prevent rotation of the ground support wheel relative to the bucket during at least a portion of the final dumping action and stabilization enhancement to prevent lateral tipping of the cart during the final dumping action.",

        "This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/348,679 filed Jan. 22, 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,886,838.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The invention relates to carts capable of being manually manipulated by a person and manually dumped. More specifically, the invention relates to such carts, which may be dumped utilizing a combination of a downwardly applied pressure on a handle assembly and an upwardly applied pressure on the handle assembly or dumping by an upward applied pressure on the handle assembly.",
        "2. Description of the Prior Art",
        "Numerous types of carts exist which have a wheel or wheels, a container and a handle assembly where the cart can be manually manipulated by a person and manually dumped. A classic example of such a cart is a wheel-barrow which typically has a single front wheel, opposing handles which extend from the front wheel rearward, support legs extending downward from the handle and a bucket fixedly attached to the top of the handles. Millions of such carts have been produced for domestic use in the United States. In use the wheelbarrow typically rests on the ground at the front wheel and the support legs when not being manipulated by a person. From this position the bucket of the wheelbarrow may be loaded. When the wheelbarrow is to be moved from one position to another the person grips the handles distal from the front wheel and raises the handles to raise the support legs off of the ground. At this point the wheelbarrow is supported by the front wheel and the person manipulating the handles. When a dumping of the contents of the bucket is desired, without regard for whether the support legs are in contact with the ground or elevated above the ground for movement of the wheelbarrow, the person raises the handles to angularly tip the wheelbarrow up. This operation is performed countless times each day by construction workers as well as casual users. Despite the fact that this operation is routinely performed it remains an awkward operation to perform. First the hands move upward while lifting the handles up in a pulling action then a transfer occurs where the person's grip on the handles shifts and then the person applies a pushing action upward to the handles. This operation is performed while balancing the weight of the wheelbarrow and the contents of the bucket across the opposing handles while stepping toward the wheel and on the single front wheel.",
        "Various innovations have been made to wheelbarrow designs to make the above dumping operation more controllable. A first class of innovations involves increasing the stability of the front wheel by either providing for a wider wheel or providing for opposing spaced adjacent wheels. Another class of innovations involves providing unique angular arrangement of at least the grip portion of the handles. Another class of innovations is known in the art for a more controllable dumping which involve providing for a downward pressure to be applied to the handles to perform the dumping procedure while the support legs remain in contact with the ground during the entire dumping procedure. Two examples of such designs appear in U.S. Pat. No. 1,032,009 to Long in 1912 and U.S. Pat. No. 2,037,222 to Farrar in 1935. Both of these designs have leg supports, which are fixedly positioned relative to their respective front wheels.",
        "Various deficiencies exist with the known designs for carts of the wheelbarrow type. As can be seen various attempts have been made to provide for a more controllable dumping operation of wheelbarrows. These attempts have been less efficient than desired. As such, it may be appreciated that there continues to be a need for a cart design, which provide for performance of a dumping operation, which may be easily, safely and comfortably performed. The present invention substantially fulfills these needs.",
        "In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of carts, the present invention relates to a cart for easy dumping which utilizes a downward pressure applied by a user. The cart has a handle assembly, a wheel assembly, a ground contacting assembly and a pivotal coupling. The handle assembly has a user manipulation end and a distal end. The wheel assembly has a ground support wheel, which has a rotational axis. The wheel assembly also has a bucket fixedly positioned relative to the rotational axis of the ground support wheel. The ground contacting assembly contacts the ground while the cart is in a resting orientation and provides for a leveraging when the downward pressure is applied to the handle assembly at the user manipulation end. The pivotal coupling provides for a pivoting of the handle assembly relative to select portions of the cart to apply an upward pressure to the wheel assembly in close proximity to the bucket when the downward pressure is applied to the handle assembly at the user manipulation end. The upward pressure applied to the wheel assembly utilizes a cooperation between the ground contacting assembly and the pivotal coupling where the bucket is easily dumped forward away from the user manipulation end of the handle assembly.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide for a cart which may be dumped utilizing a combination of a downward push to the handle assembly followed by an upward lift to the handle assembly or by an upward thrust on the handle assembly to toss the load.",
        "Other objects include;\n\n    \n    \n        (a) to provide for the bucket of the cart to be in a tipped position following the initial downward push applied to the handle assembly or a dumped position following the initial upward thrust applied to the handle assembly.\n        (b) to provide for a reduction in stress related injuries, including back injuries, which currently result from dumping operations of conventional fixed frame design wheelbarrows.\n        (c) to provide for replacement of a biasing point behind a center of balance plane of the bucket of the cart where relatively light downward pressure is required to be applied to the handle assembly to perform the initial dumping operation.\n        (d) to provide for an initial placement of the bucket following the initial dumping operation which utilized the downward pressure where relatively light upward pressure is required to be applied to the handle assembly to perform the final dumping operation.\n        (e) to provide for a locking device to retain the cart in a dumping orientation while the upward pressure is applied to the handle assembly during performance of the final dumping operation.\n        (f) to provide for wheel rotation blocking device to prevent rotation of the ground support wheel relative to the bucket at least during a portion of the final dumping operation.\n        (g) to provide for the rotation axis of the ground support wheel to move toward the ground contact portion of the ground contacting assembly during at least a portion of the initial dumping operation when the downward pressure is applied to the handle assembly.\n        (h) to provide for a single pivotal axis extending laterally across the cart to provide for the structural displacement during the initial dumping operation when the downward pressure is applied to the handle assembly.\n        (i) to provide for two spaced pivotal axises each extending laterally across the cart to provide for the structural displacement during the initial dumping operation when the downward pressure is applied to the handle assembly.",
        "The present invention relates to a system and method for tossing or ejecting a product from a cart or wheelbarrow. When the cart is moved from one position to a further position, a person grips the handles distal from the front wheel and raises the handles which raise the support legs of the cart off the ground. At this point, the cart is supported by the front wheel and the person manipulating the handles. When a person wishes to dump the contents of the bucket, the person can thrust the handles up angularly tipping the cart upward. The separation of the handle assembly and the bucket assembly occurs as the bucket assembly and its contents continue to follow the direction of the momentum over the balancing axis point of the cart ending up at the final dumping orientation. The dumping is done without regard for whether the support legs are in contact with the ground or elevated above the ground for movement of the cart.",
        "At this dumping orientation, the leveraged locking mechanism has been released and the contents have been dumped. Pulling back on the handles brings the wheel-bucket assembly back over the balancing axis point bringing the wheel-bucket assembly and the handle assembly back together.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to further provide a system and method for incline dumping of a cart or wheel-barrow at an incline, the balancing axis point of the cart and the center of gravity are closer together, making the wheel-bucket assembly easier for tipping. When a dumping of the contents of the bucket is desired, a person can thrust the handles up angularly, tipping the cart upward. The separation of the handle assembly and the wheel-bucket assembly occurs as the wheel-bucket assembly and its contents continue to follow the direction of the momentum over the balancing axis point of the cart ending up at the final dumping orientation. The dumping is done without regard for whether the support legs are in contact with the ground or elevated above the ground for movement of the cart.",
        "At this dumping orientation, the leverage locking mechanism has been released and the contents have been dumped. Pulling back on the handles brings the wheel-bucket back over the balancing axis point bringing the wheel-bucket assembly and the handle assembly back together.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for dumping a load from a cart by pushing down the handles of the cart. Pushing down on the handles causes a leveraging to occur in the handle assembly. The front end of the handle assembly pushes up toward the rear of the wheel-bucket assembly while pushing down and pivoting on the rear ground supporting couplings. By pivoting the arm assembly up and down, this pushes down on the rear ground support couplings causing the ground support to rock back toward the rear which causes a pushing up on the forward ground support couplings located near the center of the wheel-bucket assembly.",
        "The ground support assembly has a pressure bearing point of contact with the ground close to the center of gravity of the load and a curved bracket at the bottom that extends upward laterally toward the handles. When the curved bracket is provided a pressure bearing axis of the ground contacting assembly, it typically will move along the curve back toward the handles when the downward pressure is applied to the handle assembly at the user manipulation end. The extension of the curved bracket keeps the handles higher off the ground which also contributes in raising the cart assembly higher at the rear.",
        "During the initial downward pushing of the handles, the front end pivots upward from the ground supports' rear coupling, pushing up on the linkage coupling which connects to the cart assembly. This causes a division between the wheel-bucket assembly and the hand assembly to occur. The length of the linkage determines the expansion of the arc.",
        "As the bucket tips forward after the initial pushing down on the handles, a transferring starts to occur over the axis of the wheel. The weight begins to become displaced. In the leveraged position, the displacement has made the weight lighter on the user end. The center of gravity of the load has moved toward the axis of the wheel. This combined with the downward angle of the handles make the leveraging easier for the final dumping procedure.",
        "The present invention relates to a system and method for lifting from a dumping position. In a crouched lifting position, after the initial downward push on the handles, a person's legs will be bent, back straight, and arms extended downward holding the ends of the handles. As a person's legs are stretched out to lift the heaviest part of the load to their waist area, the weight diminishes from the load on the user side of the axis of the wheel due to the displacement of the load that crosses over the balancing axis point where the tipping takes place. This operation is performed while balancing the weight of the cart and the contents of the bucket across opposing handles on the wheel or wheels having both feet stationed on the ground.",
        "In a standing position, after the initial lifting from a crouched position up to a person's waist area, the leverage load weight has diminished substantially due to the increased displacement of the load that crossed over the balancing axis point of the cart making it easier for a person's arms to lift the remaining part of the load over the balancing axis point to a dump position.",
        "During the final dumping action, a fulcrum transfer occurs between the axis of ground bearing wheel and the nose of the wheel-bucket assembly where the displacement of the load occurs. The nose of the wheel-bucket assembly now becomes the balancing axis point for the remaining dumping procedure. At this dumping orientation, the leveraged locking mechanism has been released and the contents have been dumped. Pulling back on the handles brings the wheel-bucket assembly back over the balancing axis point bringing the wheel-bucket assembly and the handle assembly back together.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to be able to dump the contents of the cart in any direction.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide a latching assembly between the bucket and the handle assembly.",
        "These together with other objects of the invention, along with the various features of novelty, which characterize the invention, are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and the specific objects attained by its uses, reference should be had to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which there is illustrated the preferred embodiments of the invention.",

Then applying an upward pressure to the user manipulation end of the handle assembly of the cart wherein the bucket angularly tips up at the rearward extremity to a dumping orientation by which point the locking device releases the handle assembly.

The ground contacting assembly has a ground contact portion, which makes contact with the ground surface during certain operations of the cart. The ground contacting assembly may take many forms but preferably will distribute the weight of the cart, and any load positioned thereon, to, or toward, the opposing lateral sides of the cart while the cart is in the resting orientation, as conventionally known for wheelbarrow type carts. The ground contact portion preferably has a curvature thereon where a rolling contact with the ground surface occurs during the initial dumping operation.

The application of upward pressure to the user manipulation end of the handle assembly occurs subsequent to the application of the downward pressure of the initial dumping action. During the application of the upward pressure the bucket angularly tips up at the rearward extremity to the dumping orientation. The ground support wheel rotation blocking assembly acts to prevent the cart from rolling during a portion of the dumping operation. Many structures are known in the art to provide for such blocking. The blocking may act upon some portion of the actual wheel or may act upon the axle bearing the wheel. A separate dedicated blocking member may be employed or a pivotal contact of the bucket with the wheel may be employed.",
