        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to liquid crystal display (LCD) devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to a circuit and a method for sensing an open-circuit lamp of a backlight unit, and a display device with a circuit for sensing an open-circuit lamp of a backlight unit.",
        "2. Discussion of the Related Art",
        "Cathode ray tube (CRT) devices have been widely used as display devices such as televisions or monitors. However, the CRT devices have the drawbacks of heavy weight and big size.",
        "To substitute the CRT devices, liquid crystal display (LCD) devices have been researched and developed. The LCD devices are advantageously light-weight, dimensionally compact, and have low power consumption during operation. Recently, the LCD devices have been widely used as display devices such as monitors for desktop computers, outdoor monitors of more than 30 inches, and hang-on-the-wall televisions as well as monitors for laptop computers.",
        "Generally, LCD devices display images by controlling transmittance of external light source. Thus, the LCD devices need an external light source such as backlight units.",
        "Backlight units are classified into an edge type and a direct type according to the position of a light source with respect to a display panel. In direct-type backlight units, a light source is disposed directly under a display panel. Since the direct-type backlight units can provide high luminance, the direct-type backlight units are widely used for large LCD devices of more than 30 inches.",
        "A direct-type backlight unit uses a plurality of lamps as a light source. The lamp may include a cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) or an external electrode fluorescent lamp (EEFL). However, if one lamp is open-circuit, a higher voltage will be applied to the other lamps. Accordingly, this may decrease the lifespan of the lamps or affect the operation of the lamps.",
        "To solve this problem, a circuit for sensing an open-circuit lamp may be added to an inverter. However, since the related art circuit shuts down the power only when a plurality of lamps are open-circuit, the problems of stability of the device still exist.",
        "Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a circuit an a method for sensing an open-circuit lamp of a backlight unit, and a display device with a circuit for sensing an open-circuit lamp that substantially obviate one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.",
        "An advantage of the present invention is to provide a circuit and a method for sensing an open-circuit of a backlight unit, and a display device with a circuit for sensing an open-circuit lamp that effectively protect the backlight unit and increase a lifespan of the backlight unit.",
        "Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. These and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.",
        "To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described, a circuit for sensing an open-circuit lamp includes an enable signal output unit outputting an enable signal, a reference voltage output unit outputting a reference voltage, a sensing voltage output unit outputting a sensed voltage for deciding whether the lamp is open-circuit, a voltage comparison unit comparing the sensed voltage with the reference voltage and then outputting a decision signal according to a result of comparing the sensed voltage with the reference voltage, and an enable signal control unit controlling an output of the enable signal according to the decision signal.",
        "In another aspect, a display device includes a display panel, a panel driving circuit for driving the display panel, a lamp unit including at least one lamp and providing light the display panel, the at least one lamp having electrodes at both ends thereof, a circuit for sensing an open-circuit lamp and a system power control unit controlling power supply according an enable signal. The circuit for sensing the open-circuit lamp includes an enable signal output unit outputting an enable signal, a reference voltage output unit outputting a reference voltage, a sensing voltage output unit outputting a sensed voltage for deciding whether the lamp is open-circuit, a voltage comparison unit comparing the sensed voltage with the reference voltage and then outputting a decision signal according to a result of comparing the sensed voltage with the reference voltage, and an enable signal control unit controlling output of the enable signal according to the decision signal.",

        "Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.",
        "Lamps such as a cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL), an external electrode fluorescent lamp (EEFL), or a flat lamp are used as a light source for a display device. The lamps have infinite impedance when a voltage is applied in an early stage, and then the lamps have impedance of several hundred ohms to several thousand ohms after the voltage is stably applied. However, when one electrode of the lamp is open-circuit, the open-circuit electrode has infinite impedance, and thus a voltage applied to the open-circuit electrode is increased sharply.",
        "Accordingly, in the present invention, the infinite impedance of the open-circuit electrode is used for sensing an open-circuit lamp. That is, change of voltage at the open-circuit lamp electrode or change of an induced voltage at the open-circuit lamp electrode is measured and then the measured voltage is compared with a reference voltage to determine whether a lamp is open-circuit.",
        "FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a circuit for sensing an open-circuit lamp of a backlight unit according to an embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 1, a circuit 1 for sensing an open-circuit lamp in this embodiment includes an enable signal output unit 10, a reference voltage output unit 20, a sensing voltage output unit 30, a voltage comparison unit 40, and an enable signals control unit 50.",
        "The enable signal output unit 10 outputs an enable signal ENA for enabling the operation of a backlight unit. The enable signal ENA may be also used to enable the operation of a liquid crystal panel. The enable signal ENA instructs a power source unit (not shown) to continuously apply a voltage to the backlight unit.",
        "The reference voltage output unit 20 outputs a reference voltage Vref as a comparison standard to decide whether a lamp is open-circuit. The reference voltage Vref may be provided from an additional external circuit. For example, a voltage at a low voltage terminal of a secondary coil of a transformer in a lamp-driving inverter circuit may be used as the reference voltage Vref.",
        "The sensing voltage output unit 30 senses whether electrodes of a lamp are open-circuit. The sensing voltage output unit 30 outputs a sensed voltage Vs to indicate whether the lamp is in a normal state (i.e., a closed-circuit state) or in an abnormal state (i.e., an open-circuit state). When the electrode of the lamp is open-circuit, a voltage or an electric field around the electrode is changed due to the infinite impedance of the electrode.",
        "The voltage comparison unit 40, such as a comparator, receiving the sensed voltage Vs from the sensing voltage output unit 30 and the reference voltage Vref from the reference voltage output unit 20, compares the sensed voltage Vs with the reference voltage Vref. Thus, the voltage comparison unit 40 outputs a decision signal S when an increased voltage is detected due to an increase in impedance of an open-circuit lamp. In an embodiment, the voltage comparison unit 40 can be an operational amplifier (OP-AMP).",
        "The enable signal control unit 50 receives the enable signal ENA from the enable signal output unit 10 and controls the output of the enable signal according to the decision signal S from the voltage comparison unit 40. In an embodiment, the enable signal control unit 50 may include a transistor. If the output of the enable signal is cut off due to the open-circuit lamp, the power supply stops providing power and the display device is shut down.",
        "FIG. 2 is a circuit diagram illustrating a part of a circuit for sensing an open-circuit lamp of a backlight unit according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 2, voltage-dividing circuits S1 and S2 are connected to both electrodes P1 and P2 of a lamp L as the sensing voltage output unit 30 of FIG. 1. Each of the voltage-dividing circuits S1 and S2 includes division resistors R1 and R2 or R1\u2032 and R2\u2032 connected in series and outputs a sensed voltage Vs1 or Vs2.",
        "A fluorescent lamp is driven by boosting an inputted power from about 220V AC (alternating current) voltage to about 1000 to 1500 V AC voltage through the transformers Tx1 and Tx2 which apply the boosted power to the electrodes P1 and P2 of the lamp L. In an embodiment, the division resistors R1 and R2 or R1\u2032 and R2\u2032 may be formed such that the sensed voltages divided by the voltage-dividing circuits S1 and S2 are about several volts (V). In addition, a low voltage L at a secondary coil of one transformer Tx1 may be used as the reference voltage Vref of the reference voltage output unit 20.",
        "If one electrode P1 or P2 of the lamp L is open-circuit, a voltage at the electrode P1 or P2 is increased due to the infinite impedance of the electrode P1 or P2. Therefore, the sensed voltages Vs1 and Vs2 outputted from the voltage-dividing circuit S1 or S2 are also increased, and the open-circuit lamp is detected by comparing the sensed voltages Vs1 and Vs2 with the reference voltage Vref. As a result, appropriate measures such as cutting off voltages are carried out.",
        "FIG. 3 is a circuit diagram illustrating a circuit for sensing an open-circuit lamp of a backlight unit including the structure of FIG. 2 according to the first embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 3, the backlight unit includes a plurality of lamps. A plurality of sensing voltage output units are respectively connected to the lamps, and output sensed voltages Vs_Lamp1 to Vs_LampN (N is a natural number). The sensed voltages Vs_Lamp1 to Vs_LampN are inputted to an operational amplifier OP-AMP, which is a comparator and receives a reference voltage Vref as a comparison standard. If there is an increased voltage among the sensed voltages Vs_Lamp1 to Vs_LampN, the operational amplifier OP-AMP outputs a decision signal. Accordingly, a transistor TR, as an enable signal control unit in this embodiment, receives the decision signal and blocks the output of the enable signal.",
        "The circuit for sending an open-circuit lamp may be used for a display device, which includes a display panel, a panel-driving circuit unit for driving the display panel, a lamp unit providing light to the display panel, a lamp-driving circuit unit for driving the lamp unit, and a system power control unit controlling power supply according to an enable signal. Here, if an open-circuit lamp is sensed, the power supply is cut off. Accordingly, the stability of the device is increased.",
        "FIGS. 4A and 4B are views illustrating a sensing voltage output unit of a circuit for sending an open-circuit lamp according to a second embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 4A is a plan view of the sensing voltage output unit, and FIG. 4B is a cross-sectional view along the line IV-IV. In the second embodiment, the open-circuit lamp is detected by sensing the change of a voltage induced according to the change of a voltage inputted to an electrode of a lamp. That is, when one electrode of the lamp is open-circuit, the voltage at the electrode is increased due to the infinite impedance of the electrode. Thus, if a conductor is disposed in an electric field of a voltage supplying line for providing the voltage, a voltage is induced in the conductor, and the induced voltage is used as a sensed voltage Vs to determine whether the lamp is open-circuit.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 4A, a plurality of lamps L1, L2, L3 and L4 are connected to lamp connectors CNT1 and CNT2 that are formed on a first side A of a printed circuit board PCB. Lamp-driving voltage lines 81, 82, 83 and 84 extend from a main power line 80 and are connected to the lamp connectors CNT1 and CNT2. The lamp-driving voltage lines 81, 82, 83 and 84 provide lamp-driving voltages to the respective lamps L1, L2, L3 and L4. First patterns C1, C2, C3 and C4 of any shapes and sizes are formed on the lamp-driving voltage lines 81, 82, 83 and 84, respectively. The first patterns C1, C2, C3 and C4 are formed on the first side A of the printed circuit board PCB. The first patterns C1, C2, C3 and C4 are formed of a conductive material, and the first patterns C1, C2, C3 and C4 receive the lamp-driving voltages from the lamp-driving voltage line 81, 82, 83 and 84.",

Then, the induced voltages, as the sensed voltages Vs, are compared with the reference voltage Vref through the voltage comparison unit 40 of FIG. 1.

In the third embodiment, a conductive pattern is disposed in an electric field of a lamp, and an induced voltage induced due to the conductive pattern is used as the sensed voltage. When the lamp is open-circuit, a higher induced voltage, which is proportional to a higher voltage at an electrode of the lamp due to the infinite impedance, is induced by the conductive pattern.
