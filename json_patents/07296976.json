        "The present invention was made under U.S. Government Contract Number N0019-02-3003 awarded by the Navy, and the Navy may have certain rights in the present invention.",
        "The present invention relates generally to a system for correcting an unbalance in rotating components that can result in an unacceptable level of vibration during operation. More specifically, in one form the present invention relates to a balancing system including two mass asymmetric rings that are coupled to the rotating component through a splined interface. Although the present invention was developed for balancing gas turbine engine components, application in other areas of technology are contemplated herein, such as high speed machine tool applications, gearboxes, actuators and motors.",
        "It is recognized that gas turbine engines include components that rotate at high rates of speed. The dynamic unbalance of the components can lead to severe vibration that reduces the useful life of the component.",
        "The engineers and scientists developing gas turbine engine technology recognize that one can add or remove material at select locations to achieve proper balance for the component. Many of the techniques included the addition and removal of separate balance weights from the component and the actual removal of material from the component. The prior balancing techniques that relied upon the adding of separable balance weights are often limited by issues such as: configuration management and structural integrity of the separable weights, additional part count, and lack of flexibility in adjustment. In many of the prior techniques to balance the component, the component had to be removed and sent to a machine shop for machining, which is time consuming and adds the possibility of a machining error in the process. Alternatively, the component may have been hand machined without removal from the machine. In either case, the machining of the component to perfect a balance condition can be very difficult and in many cases any error in machining is irreversible.",
        "Although there are currently many methods to reduce unbalance conditions in rotatable components there remains a significant need for further technological solutions in this area. The present invention satisfies this need and others in a novel and unobvious way.",

        "Yet another form of the present invention contemplates a method of balancing a rotatable gas turbine engine component with two balance rings having an imbalance. The method comprising: determining the orientation of each of the two balance rings to locate a mass imbalance portion of each of the balance rings relative to the component to effect an unbalance correction of the rotatable component; mating the spline teeth of a first one of the balance rings with the spline teeth of the component to position the mass imbalance portion of the first one of the balance rings proximate the orientation in the determining act; positioning a second one of the balance rings adjacent the first one of the balance rings; mating the spline teeth of the second one of the balance rings with the spline teeth of the component to position the mass imbalance portion of the second one of the balance rings proximate the orientation from the determining act; and, restraining movement of the two balance rings relative to the component.",

The term component is intended to be read very broadly and includes, but not limited to, a unitary item, multi-part items, assemblies, shafts, disks, drums and/or gears. Further, in one form, the present invention is particularly useful for balancing the rotating components of gas turbine engines including, but not limited to compressor disks and assemblies, turbine disks and assemblies, gears and shaft assemblies, fan disks and assemblies. The present invention is generally applicable to a variety of applications including those needing single or multi-plane balancing. The text will describe the present invention with reference to gas turbine engine components, however it should be appreciated that the present invention is also contemplated for utilization in other fields of technology.",

In balancing a component with the present invention the operating speeds contemplated for the gas turbine engine components to be balanced are within a range of 3,000 to 20,000 revolutions per minute (RPM), and preferably within a range of 3,000 to 10,000 RPM. However, other operating speeds are fully contemplated herein. In one form the component 20 has an opening/recess 21 at one end. An axial stop 22 is located within the component and limits the distance that the counterweight balance rings 40 can be positioned within the opening/recess 21. In one form the counterweight balance rings are positioned adjacent to one another and are non-concentric. The application contemplates that the opening/recess 21 can extend only a partial length of the component or may extend the entire length of the component 20.",
        "Opening/recess 21 has a portion with a circular inner surface including a spline 30 formed thereon. In one form a wall of the component 20 defines the opening/recess 21. The term spline as utilized herein is intended to be read broadly and includes, but is not limited to, serrations, teeth, notches key slots, and index holes unless specifically provided to the contrary. The spline 30 is preferably defined by a plurality of spline teeth 30a that are spaced around the circumference of the circular inner surface. However, the present invention also contemplates that there may only be a few teeth/serrations in the spline. In one form the spline teeth 30a are circumferentially spaced around a substantial majority of the component. In another form the spline teeth 30a are circumferentially spaced around the entire circular inner surface.

In one form of the present invention the counterweight balance rings are substantially identical. The continuous hoop structure defines a continuous ring that is not interrupted as in a split ring. In one form the counterweight balance rings 40 are capable of carrying their own centrifugal load at the rotational speeds associated with the rotating component. Each of the counterweight balance rings 40 have a substantially constant outer diameter including a circular outer surface with a spline 80 formed thereon. The spline 80 is preferably defined by a plurality of spline teeth 80a that are spaced around the circumference of the circular outer surface. In one form the spline teeth 80a are circumferentially spaced around a substantial majority of the counterweight balance ring 40. However, in another form the spline teeth 80a are circumferentially spaced around the entire circular outer surface. Spline teeth 80a are preferably formed substantially parallel with the centerline X, however other geometric relationships between the spline teeth 80a and the centerline X are contemplated herein. The spline teeth 80a are configured to engage with the spline teeth 30a to couple the counterweight balance ring 40 to the component 20 and limit the circumferential and radial motion between each of the counterweight balance rings 40 and the component 20 during rotational movement of the component. Counterweight balance rings 40 are coupled to and rotate with the component 20.",

        "Each of the counterweight balance rings 40 have a mass asymmetry that is adapted to be oriented relative to the component 20 to create an unbalance correction. The unbalance correction can be within the range of zero to twice that of the balance ring.

In one embodiment each of the counterweight balance rings 40 is moveable/indexable independently of the other counterweight balance ring 40 and they are not mechanically fastened to one another. The present application contemplates that in one form each of the counterweight balance rings 40 has a known and equal level of imbalance.",

In one form the mass asymmetry is defined on an arc up to 180\u00b0 in circumferential extent. The maximum inner diameter of counterweight balance ring 40 is defined to surface 50 and extends over about 180\u00b0 of the circumference. A minimum inner diameter of the counterweight balance ring 40 is defined to surface 70 and extends over the remaining portion the circumference.

A retainer 100 is used to fix the counterweight balance rings 40 in place axially after installation. The retainer 100 can be, but is not limited to, a snap ring, spanner nut, pins, retaining plate and shaft and face. The position of the counterweight balance rings 40 relative to one another in FIG. 5 is purely illustrative. There is no intention herein to limit the present application to the relative orientation of the counterweight balance rings 40 as set forth in the drawing.
