        "FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of a prior art memory device. The memory device 100 includes a memory cell array 110, a clock synchronizing circuit block 120, a read command path block 130, a data output buffer 140, a mode register 150 and a latency circuit 160. In operation, data is written into the memory cell array 110 and read out from the memory cell array 110. If a read command is asserted to the memory device 100, data is read out from the memory cell array 110 according to an externally received address. A buffer 116 receives and temporarily stores the address. A row decoder 112 receives the stored address and decodes a row address of the memory cell array 110 from the address. A column decoder 114 receives the stored address and decodes a column address of the memory cell array 110 from the address. The memory cell array 110 outputs the data addressed by the row and column addresses. The data output buffer 140 receives the data output from the memory cell array 110, and outputs the data based on a latency signal from the latency circuit 160 and an internal data output clock signal CLKDQ.",
        "The clock synchronizing circuit block 120 generates the data output clock signal CLKDQ based on an external clock signal ECLK. The external clock signal ECLK serves as a reference clock signal for most commands of the memory device 100. Specifically, most commands are asserted to the memory device 100 in synchronization with the external clock signal ECLK. As shown in FIG. 1, the clock synchronizing circuit block 120 is a delay locked loop (DLL) circuit. The DLL circuit 120 includes a variable delay 122, a data output buffer replica 124 and a phase detector 126. The DLL circuit 120 is a well known circuit such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,855; and therefore, will not be described in detail. The DLL circuit 120 generates the data output clock signal CLKDQ as a phase lead version of the external clock ECLK. Namely, the data output clock signal CLKDQ has the same frequency as the external clock ECLK, but the pulses of the data output clock signal CLKDQ precede the pulses of the external clock signal ECLK by a data output time tSAC. The data output time is a measurement of the time it takes the data output buffer 140 to output data. Accordingly, the DLL circuit 120 causes data to be output from the data output buffer 140 in synchronization with the external clock ECLK.",
        "The read command path block 130 receives the read command and the external clock signal ECLK. An internal clock generator 132 receives the external clock signal ECLK and generates an internal clock signal PCLK from the external clock signal ECLK. Specifically, the internal clock signal PCLK is a buffered version of the external clock signal ECLK. Therefore, the internal clock signal PCLK has the same frequency as the external clock signal ECLK and the level of the internal clock signal PCLK swing is a CMOS level (VSS-VCC) buffered signal delayed from the external clock signal ECLK. The internal clock signal PCLK is used to control peripheral circuits (not shown) such as data sense amplifiers, data multiplexers, etc., in the memory device 100. A read command buffer 134 in the read command path block 130 receives the read command and the internal clock signal PCLK. The read command buffer 134 inputs the read command synchronized with the internal clock signal PCLK, and outputs an internal read signal PREAD, which is supplied to the latency circuit 160.",
        "The memory device 100 has several modes of operation. The mode register 150 stores a mode register set (MRS) command asserted to the memory device 100. The MRS command indicates the mode of the memory device 100. CAS latency information is determined by the MRS command. The CAS latency information indicates the CAS latency mode, which is the number of clock cycles of the external clock signal ECLK that should occur between the receipt of a read command or column address until data is output by the memory device 100. Stated another way, data is output from the memory device in a CAS latency number of clock cycles after receipt of the read command (a column address being asserted together with the read command).",
        "The latency circuit 160 receives the CAS latency information from the mode register 150 and generates a latency signal such that the data output buffer 140 is enabled to output the data according to the desired CAS latency. More specifically, the data output buffer 140 outputs the stored data in response to the data output clock signal CLKDQ while the latency signal is enabled.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates a prior art latency circuit 160. As shown, the latency circuit 160 includes first, second and third D-flip flops 215, 225 and 235 connected in cascade. Each D-flip flop receives the data output clock signal CLKDQ at its clock input. The internal read signal PREAD is supplied to the D input of the first D-flip flop 215. The internal read signal PREAD and Q output of each of the first-third D-flip flops 215, 225 and 235 are respectively connected to first-fourth switches 210, 220, 230 and 240. The first-fourth switches 210, 220, 230 and 240 are respectively controlled by a CAS latency indicator CL1, CL2, CL3 and CL4 decoded from the CAS latency information. Namely, the CAS latency information is N bits that indicate the CAS latency mode. The N bits are decoded by a simple logic decoder (not shown) to produce the CAS latency indicators CL1-CL4 associated with each CAS latency mode. As will be appreciated, the CAS latency indicator for the activated CAS latency mode will be, for example, logic high, while the other CAS latency indicators will be logic low. The output of the first-fourth switches 210, 220, 230 and 240 serve as the latency signal. In operation, only one of the CAS latency modes will be logic high; therefore, only one of the first-fourth switches 210, 220, 230 and 240 will transfer a signal for output as the latency signal. For example, when the CAS latency is 1, CL1 is logic high and turns on first switch 210. At this time, the other CAS latency indicators CL2, CL3, and CL4 are logic low. The internal read signal is then transferred as the latency signal via the first switch 210. When the CAS latency is two (i.e., CL equals 2), then CL2 is logic high, while CL1, CL3 and CL4 are logic low. Thus, the internal read signal PREAD is transferred as the latency signal via the first D-flip flop 215 and the second switch 220. The first D-flip flop 215 is triggered by the data output clock signal CLKDQ and delays the internal read signal PREAD being output as the latency signal by about one clock cycle. The operation when the CAS latency is three or four is similar to that discussed above with respect to the CAS latency of two, and therefore will not be repeated for the sake of brevity. Additionally, it will be understood that CAS latencies greater than four could be handled by the addition of more D-flip flops and switches.",
        "FIG. 3A illustrates a timing diagram of the read operation when the CAS latency is 1. At a clock cycle C0, a read command 310 is asserted, and an internal read signal PREAD is generated by the read command path block 130 after an internal delay time tREAD. The latency signal is then enabled in response to the internal read signal PREAD as discussed above with respect to FIG. 2. As further shown in FIG. 3A, the DLL circuit 120 generates the data output clock signal CLKDQ such that the rising edge of the data output clock signal CLKDQ precedes the rising edge of the external clock signal ECLK by a period of time tSAC, where the time period tSAC equals the delay between enabling data output from the data output buffer 140 and the actual output of data from the memory device 100. As further discussed above with respect to FIG. 1, the data output buffer 140 outputs data when triggered by the data output clock signal CLKDQ only when the latency signal is enabled. Because the CAS latency has been set to 1 in this example, the latency signal is enabled prior to receipt of the data output clock signal CLKDQ. As a result, data is output from the memory device 100 in synchronization with the first clock pulse C1 of the external clock signal ECLK following the clock pulse C0 of the external clock signal ECLK when the read command 310 was received. The time delays tREAD and tSAC are internal delays set according to current process technology. Minimizing these delays improves the timing margin as to when the latency signal must be enabled before receipt of the data output clock signal CLKDQ. As the frequency of operation increases (i.e., the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK increases), the period between clock pulses of the external clock signal ECLK decreases. This reduces the timing margin for supplying the latency signal. Consequently, above a certain operating frequency, the latency signal enables after the data output clock signal CLKDQ, and the data is no longer output at the desired CAS latency. This results in a data read operation failure.",
        "FIG. 3B illustrates another example of where the operation frequency is low enough such that a proper data read operation takes place for a CAS latency of 2. However, FIG. 3C shows the operation of the memory device 100 during a high frequency operation, wherein a data read operation failure takes place. As shown in this example, tREAD plus tSAC is greater than the period tCC of the external clock signal ECLK such that the internal read signal PREAD is asserted after the rising edge of a pulse CDQ1 of the data output clock signal CLKDQ. The latency signal thus becomes enabled after a pulse CDQ4 of the data output clock signal CLKDQ for the desired CAS latency. In the example of FIG. 3C, the desired CAS latency is 4, and as is shown, data is output according to a CAS latency of 5 instead of a CAS latency of 4. As a result, a data read operation failure takes place.",

Read data is stored in an output buffer, which outputs data based on a latency signal generated in accordance with the desired CAS latency of the memory device. The memory device includes a latency circuit that permits a desired CAS latency of the memory device to be achieved without read operation error even when the memory device is operating at high frequency.",
        "More specifically, in one embodiment the latency circuit selectively associates at least one transfer signal with at least one sampling signal based on the desired CAS latency to create a desired timing relationship between the associated sampling and transfer signals.

The data output buffer replica 124 replicates the output delay of the data output buffer 140. Accordingly, the buffered clock signal CLKF is a delayed version of the data output clock signal CLKDQ. The internal clock generator replica 462 is a replica of the internal clock generator 132, and generates a replica internal clock signal PCLKR. A master clock generator 700 receives-the internal clock signal PCLK and the replica internal clock signal PCLKR and generates a master clock signal PCLKD.",

The output of the inverter 704 controls the operation of a PMOS transistor 706, which is connected in series with an NMOS transistor 708 between a power supply voltage VCC and a reference or ground voltage VSS. The operation of the NMOS transistor 708 is controlled by a reset signal. An enable signal is generated at the node connecting the PMOS transistor 706 and the NMOS transistor 708. This enable signal is latched by a latch 720, which is comprised of inverters 722 and 724 connected in a loop configuration to the enable signal node EN. An AND gate 710 receives the enable signal and a delayed internal clock signal PCLK2. A delay unit 702 receives and delays the internal clock signal PCLK to generate the delayed internal clock signal PCLK2. The period of the delay substantially equals the period of time to generate the enable signal based on the replica internal clock signal PCLKR. The output of the AND gate 710 serves as the master clock signal PCLKD.",
        "FIG. 8 illustrates the operation of the master clock generator 700. As shown, when the reset signal is enabled, the NMOS transistor 708 pulls the enable signal to logic low. As a result, the AND gate 710 generates a logic low master clock signal PCLKD. When the reset signal is no longer enabled, the replica internal clock signal PCLKR controls the state of the enable signal such that at the rising edge of the replica internal clock signal PCLKR, the enable signal transitions to a logic high state. As a result, the AND gate 710 will output the delayed internal clock signal PCLK2 as the master clock signal PCLKD. The-replica internal clock signal PCLKR is generated from output of the DLL circuit 120. As a result, the replica internal clock signal PCLKR experiences some jitter, which decreases the frequency performance of the memory device. By using the replica internal clock signal PCLKR to enable the master clock signal PCLKD and by outputting the master clock signal PCLKD as a delayed version of the internal clock signal PCLK, which has not experienced such jitter, the master clock generator 700 generates a master clock signal PCLKD without jitter. Furthermore, because the internal clock signal PCLK is used as an internal clock signal for many of the peripheral circuits in the memory device 400, the internal clock signal PCLK experiences a large load. By contrast, the master clock signal. PCLKD is not as loaded, and therefore can be used as a clock signal of the latency circuit 500 as described in detail below.",

The other input of the first-fourth AND gates 525-528 and the clock inputs of the first-fourth D-flip flops 521-524 receive the master clock signal PCLKD in the case of the sampling clock signal generator 510 or the data output clock signal CLKDQ in the case of the transfer signal generator 550. Also as shown, the Q output of the fourth and final D-flip flop 524 is fed to the D input of the first D-flip flop 521.

The outputs of the switches are each connected to an output latch 539. Whether the first-fourth switches 535-538 transfer the respectively received first-fourth output signals LS1-LS4 to the output latch 539 depends upon the state of the transfer signal received by that switch as will be described in more detail below. For example, if the third switch 537 receives a logic high transfer signal when the third output signal LS3 is logic high as shown in FIG. 9Q, then the logic high output signal LS3 is transferred to the latch 539 and a logic high latency signal is generated as shown in FIG. 9S.

Pulses of the external clock signal ECLK have been labeled 1, 2, 3, etc., in order to provide an understanding of the relationship between the external clock signal ECLK and both the data output clock signal CLKDQ and the master clock signal PCLKD. As shown in FIG. 9D, after a first internal delay period tRS1, the DLL circuit 120 begins generating the output clock signal CLKDQ. As shown in FIG. 9E, after a second internal delay period tRS2, the master clock generator 700 begins generating the master clock signal PCLKD. As was described previously, the output data clock signal CLKDQ precedes the external clock signal ECLK by a time period tSAC. The clock pulses of the output data clock signal CLKDQ have also been numbered 1, 2, 3, etc., to show the relationship between these clock signal pulses and the clock signal pulses of the external clock signal ECLK. The master clock generator 700 begins generating the master clock signal PCLKD, a time period equal to tSAC plus tREAD after the output data clock signal CLKDQ is generated. The time period tSAC has been discussed in detail above. The time period tREAD is the period of time between receipt of the read command and generation of the internal read signal PREAD by the read command buffer 134. The pulses of the master clock signal PCLKD illustrated in FIG. 9E have also been labeled 1, 2, 3, etc., to show the correspondence between these clock signal pulses and the clock signal pulses of the data output clock signal CLKDQ and the external clock signal ECLK. Accordingly, it will be understood that the reset operation establishes the timing relationships between these clock signals.",

As demonstrated by FIGS. 9F-9I, each transfer signal has a frequency equal to the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK divided by the maximum number of supported CAS latency modes. Namely, it will be appreciated that the frequency of the transfer signals is determined by the number of D-flip flops in the second ring shift register 560.",

As with the transfer signals, the sampling clock signals also have a frequency that is equal to the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK divided by the maximum number of supported CAS latency modes.

Also, FIGS. 9O-9T illustrate the output signals LS1-LS4, the latency signal, and the data output from the memory device 400 when the CAS latency mode is 4 and a read command is received by the memory device 400 as illustrated in FIG. 9C.",
        "As shown in FIG. 9C, in this operational example, the read command signal is received when clock signal pulse 3 of the external clock signal ECLK transitions to logic high. Consequently, as shown in FIG. 9N, the internal read signal PREAD is generated after an internal delay of tREAD, by the read command path block 130.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 9F-9I, when the CAS latency is 4, the first-fourth transfer signals T1-T4 are mapped by the mapping unit 540 to the second, third, fourth and first output signals TCLK2, TCLK3, TCLK4 and TCLK1. Stated another way, first-fourth switches 535-538 receive the fourth, first, second and third transfer signals T1-T4, respectively. As such, when the internal read signal PREAD transitions to logic high as shown in FIG. 9N, the third sampling clock signal SCLK3 causes the third latch 533 to latch the logic high PREAD signal. The other latches will have latched logic low PREAD. Accordingly, only the third output signal LS3 from the third latch 533 will have a logic high state as shown in FIGS. 9O-9R.",
        "Then, when the second transfer signal T2 transitions to logic high, the third switch 537 supplies a logic high signal to the output latch 539, which in turn supplies a logic high latency signal as shown in FIG. 9S. Because the latency signal is logic high when the output data clock signal CLKDQ transitions high at pulse 7 of the output data clock signal CLKDQ, the memory device 400 will output data D1 as shown in FIG. 9T at the rising edge of pulse 7 of the external clock signal ECLK as shown in FIG. 9B. Accordingly, with the read command having been received during pulse 3 of the external clock signal ECLK and the data being output from the memory device 400 at pulse 7 of the external clock signal ECLK, a CAS latency of 4 is achieved for the high frequency operation shown in FIG. 9B. In this embodiment, a single data word is output; however, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment. Instead, by increasing the length of the read command, the number of data words output can be increased.",
        "As will be appreciated, the mapping unit 540 selectively associates the transfer signals with the sampling clock signals based on the CAS latency to create a desired timing relationship between the sampling and transfer signals. This relationship then controls the time period between the receipt of a read command and the output of data by the memory device 400. More specifically, this relationship controls the time period between receipt of the internal read signal PREAD and the generation of the latency signal. Here, the sampling clock signals trigger the first-fourth latches 531-534 and thus serve to designate a point in time when the read command is received. The association of the transfer signals with the sampling clock signals then serves as a second pointer in time as to when the latency signal should be generated. Through this arrangement and methodology, read operation errors during high frequency operation are prevented.",

Lastly, while not shown, the reset inputs of the first-fourth D-flip flops 1431-1434 receive the reset signal. The first-fourth D-flip flops 1431-1434 are resettable D-flip flops. The reset signal enables the pre-setting of the shift register such that the first-fourth D-flip flops are reset (logic low state). Additional control logic well-known in the art (not shown) is connected to the D input of the first D-flip flop 1431 to load a logic \u201c1\u201d (logic high state) into the first D-flip flop 1431.",
        "The logic high signal will load into the first D-flip flop 1431 on the rising edge of the received clock signal (PCLKD or CLKDQ ), and this pulse will be transferred to the second-fourth D-flip flops 1432-1433 depending on the CAS latency information as each clock signal pulse is received. When the logic high signal resides in a respective one of the first-fourth D-flip flops 1431-1434, the corresponding sampling clock signal/transfer clock signal is active.",
        "When the first-third control logic units 1441-1443 receive a logic low CAS latency indicator, the first-third control logic units 1441-1443 transfer the Q output from the previous D-flip flop to the D input of the next D-flip flop. When the first-third control logic units 1441-1443 receive a logic high CAS latency indicator, the first-third control logic units 1441-1443 output a logic low state to the next D-flip flop regardless of the Q output of the previous D-flip flop.",
        "As will be appreciated, the logic high state loaded into the first D-flip flop 1431 will only be transferred to a next position in the ring shift register selectively formed by the first-fourth D-flip flops 1431-1434 based on the CAS latency information. Thus, the CAS latency information controls the number of active sampling clock signals and transfer clock signals.",
        "For example, if the CAS latency information indicates CAS latency mode 4, then the CAS latency indicators CL2 and CL3 are logic low. Accordingly, the logic high state loaded into the first D-flip flop 1431 will be transferred to the second D-flop flop 1432 and then the third D-flip flop 1433 in synchronization with the received clock signal (PCLKD/CLKDQ). But, this logic high state will not be transferred from the third control logic unit 1443 to the fourth D-flop flop 1434 by third control logic unit 1443 because the third control logic unit 1443 receives a logic high CAS latency indicator CL4. As a result, the first-third sampling clock signal SCLK1-SCLK3 and the first-third transfer clock signals TCLK1-TCLK3 will be activated, but not the fourth sampling clock signal SCLK4 or the fourth transfer clock signal TCLK4.",
        "This operation is illustrated in FIGS. 17A, 17C-D and 17F-M. FIG. 17A illustrates the external clock signal ECLK and FIGS. 17C-D illustrate the data output clock signal CLKDQ and the master clock signal PCLKD generated from the external clock signal ECLK. FIGS. 17F-17I illustrate the first-fourth transfer clock signals TCLK1-TCLK4, and FIGS. 17J-17M illustrates the first-fourth sampling clock signals SCLK1-SCLK4 when the CAS latency mode is 4.",
        "As mentioned above, the CAS latency indicators CL2-CL5 also respectively control operation of the first-fourth switches 1461-1464. When the first-fourth switches 1461-1464 receive a logic high CAS latency indicator, the first-fourth switches 1461-1464 connect the respectively received Q output from the first-fourth D-flip flops 1431-1434 with the D input of the first D-flip flop 1431. For example, when the CAS latency information indicates a CAS latency mode of 4, then the CAS latency indicator CL4 is a logic high state, and only the third switch 1463 closes. This connects the Q output of the third D-flip flop 1433 to the D input of the first D-flip flop 1431. As discussed above, the logic high state loaded into the first D-flip flop 1431 will only propagate up to the third D-flip flop 1433 when the CAS latency mode is 4. Accordingly, the first-fourth switches 1461-1464 and the first-third control logic units 1441-1443 form control logic selectively configuring a ring shifter having a length dependent on the CAS latency information.",
        "FIG. 16 illustrates tables for CAS latency modes two-five that demonstrate which of the first-fourth transfer clock signals TCLK1-TCLK4 and which of the first-fourth sampling clock signals SCLK1-TCLK4 become active for each CAS latency mode.",
        "Next, a high frequency operation of the memory device according to the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4A, B or C and FIGS. 14-15 will be described with respect to FIGS. 17A-17S. FIG. 17A illustrates the external clock signal ECLK. Pulses of the external clock signal ECLK have been labeled 1, 2, 3, etc., in order to provide an understanding of the relationship between the external clock signal ECLK and both the data output clock signal CLKDQ and the master clock signal PCLKD. As was described previously, the output data clock signal CLKDQ shown in FIG. 17C precedes the external clock signal ECLK by a time period tSAC. The clock pulses of the output data clock signal CLKDQ have also been numbered 1, 2, 3, etc., to show the relationship between these clock signal pulses and the clock signal pulses of the external clock signal ECLK. As also discussed above, the master clock generator 700 begins generating the master clock signal PCLKD, a time period equal to tSAC plus tREAD after the output data clock signal CLKDQ is generated as shown in FIG. 17D. As shown by FIGS. 17B and 17E, the internal read command PREAD is generated a time period tREAD after receiving the read command. The pulses of the master clock signal PCLKD illustrated in FIG. 17D have also been labeled 1, 2, 3, etc., to show the correspondence between these clock signal pulses and the clock signal pulses of the data output clock signal CLKDQ and the external clock signal ECLK. It will be understood from the description of the previous embodiments, that the reset operation aids in establishing the timing relationships between these clock signals.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 17F-17H with respect to FIG. 17C, once the transfer clock signal generator 1420 begins receiving clock signal pulses of the output data clock signal CLKDQ, pulses of the first-third transfer clock signals TCLK1-TCLK3 are generated. For the reasons described in detail above and as shown by FIG. 17I, because the CAS latency is four, the transfer clock signal generator 1420 does not activate the fourth transfer clock signal TCLK4. As demonstrated by FIGS. 17F-17H, each of the active first-third transfer clock signals has a frequency equal to the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK divided by one less than the CAS latency mode. Namely, it will be appreciated that the frequency of the transfer clock signals is determined by the length of ring shift register configured by the control logic in the transfer clock signal generator 1420 based on the CAS latency mode.",
        "FIGS. 17J-17L with respect to FIG. 17D illustrate that the first-third sampling clock signals SCLK1-SCLK3 are generated by the sampling clock signal generator 1410 in synchronization with the pulses of the master clock signal PCLKD. For the reasons described in detail above and as shown by FIG. 17M, because the CAS latency is four, the sampling clock signal generator 1410 does not activate the fourth sampling clock signal SCLK4. As with the transfer clock signals, the sampling clock signals also have a frequency that is equal to the frequency of the external clock signal ECLK divided by one less than the CAS latency mode. Namely, the frequency of the activated first-third sampling clock signals SCLK1-SCLK3 is determined by the length of ring shift register configured by the control logic in the sampling clock signal generator 1410 based on the CAS latency mode.",
        "FIGS. 17N-17S illustrate the output signals LS1-LS4, the latency signal, and the data output from the memory device 400 when the CAS latency mode is 4 and a read command is received by the memory device 400 as illustrated in FIG. 17B.",
        "As shown in FIG. 17B, in this operational example, the read command signal is received when clock signal pulse zero of the external clock signal ECLK transitions to logic high. Consequently, as shown in FIG. 17E, the-internal read signal PREAD is generated after an internal delay of tREAD, by the read command path block 130. When the internal read signal PREAD transitions to logic high as shown in FIG. 17E, the first sampling clock signal SCLK1 causes the first latch 531 to latch the logic high PREAD signal. The other latches will have latched logic low PREAD. Accordingly, only the first output signal LS1 from the third latch 531 will have a logic high state as shown in FIGS. 17N-17Q.",
        "Then, when the first transfer clock signal TCLK1 transitions to logic high, the first switch 535 supplies a logic high signal to the output latch 539, which in turn supplies a logic high latency signal as shown in FIG. 17R. Because the latency signal is logic high when the output data clock signal CLKDQ transitions high at pulse 4 of the output data clock signal CLKDQ, the memory device 400 will output data D0 as shown in FIG. 9S at the rising edge of pulse 4 of the external clock signal ECLK as shown in FIG. 9A. Accordingly, a CAS latency of 4 is achieved for the high frequency operation shown in FIG. 17A. In this embodiment, a single data word is output; however, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment. Instead, by increasing the length of the read command, the number of data words output can be increased.",

        "As will be appreciated, the sampling clock signal generator 1410 and the transfer clock signal generator 1420 selectively activate the sampling and transfer clock signals and control the frequency of the activated sampling and transfer clock signals based on the CAS latency to create a desired timing relationship between the sampling and transfer clock signals. This relationship then controls the time period between the receipt of a read command and the output of data by the memory device 400. More specifically, this relationship controls the time period between receipt of the internal read signal PREAD and the generation of the latency signal. As with previous embodiments, the sampling clock signals trigger the first-fourth latches 531-534 and thus serve to designate a point in time when the read command is received. The association of the transfer clock signals with the sampling clock signals then serves as a second pointer in time as to when the latency signal should be generated. Through this arrangement and methodology, read operation errors during high frequency operation are prevention.",

The first-sixth transfer signals TCLK1-TCLK6 have the same frequency and have pulses shifted by one clock cycle with respect to a preceding transfer signal pulse. A frequency of each of the first-sixth transfer signals TCLK1-TCLK6 is identical to a frequency given by dividing a frequency of the buffered clock signal CLKF (and therefore, the data output clock CLKDQ) by the CAS latency (herein, 6).

For example, when CL=5, while the latency circuit shown in FIG. 20 generates the transfer signals TCLK1-TCLK5, the latency circuit of FIG. 23 generates the transfer signals TCLK1-TCLK4. When CL=6, while the latency circuit of FIG. 20 generates the transfer signals TCLK1-TCLK6, the latency circuit of FIG. 23 generates the transfer signals TCLK1-TCLK5. When CL=7, while the latency circuit of FIG. 20 generates the transfer signals TCLK1-TCLK7, the latency circuit of FIG. 23 generates the transfer signals TCLK1-TCLK6. When CL=8, while the latency circuit of FIG. 20 generates the transfer signals TCLK1-TCLK8, the latency circuit of FIG. 23 generates the transfer signals TCLK1-TCLK7. Namely, the transfer signal generator 820 demultiplies the buffered clock signal CLKF by the CAS latency minus one.",
        "Furthermore, it will be understood that more than one D-flip flop may be connected in series to delay the read signal PREAD and create the pre-latency signal PRE-LATENCY. For each additional D-flip flop, the number flip flops in the transfer signal generator, and therefore, the number of transfer signals is reduced. This also reduces the number of latches and switches in the clock signal generator 840. Also, it will be appreciated that the transfer signal generator 820 demultiplies the buffered clock signal CLKF by the CAS latency minus the number of flip flops delaying the read signal PREAD to create the signal PRE-LATENCY.",
        "Next, operation of the memory device according to FIGS. 1, 4A, 4B or 4C and FIGS. 23-24 will be described with respect to FIGS. 25A-25S. FIGS. 25A-25S illustrate waveforms of the signals generated by or received by the memory device of FIG. 1, 4A, 4B or 4C having a latency circuit as illustrated in FIG. 23 when the CAS latency is 6. FIGS. 25A, 25C, 25F and 25R illustrate the external clock signal ECLK, internal clock signal PCLK, buffered clock signal CLKF, and the data output clock CLKDQ, respectively. The pulses of the external clock signal ECLK, the buffered clock signal CLKF, the data output clock signal CLKDQ, and the internal clock signal PCLK have been labeled 1, 2, 3, etc. . . . in order to provide an understanding of correlations therebetween.",
        "The internal clock generator 132 shown in FIG. 1 or 4A-4C generates an internal clock signal PCLK, and generates the internal read signal PREAD as shown in FIG. 25D in response to the internal clock signal PCLK and an external read command READ CMD as shown in FIG. 25B. The internal read signal PREAD is internally enabled after tREAD from when the external read command READ CMD is synchronized with and input in a first clock cycle 1 of the external clock signal ECLK. The data output clock signal CLKDQ is generated by the DLL circuit 120 shown in FIGS. 1, 4A-4C. The buffered clock signal CLKF has a frequency equal to a frequency of the data output clock signal CLKDQ and a leading phase with respect to a phase of the data output clock signal CLKDQ. As described with reference to FIGS. 23-24, the transfer signal generator 820 generates the first-fifth transfer signals TCLK1-TCLK5 in response to the buffered output clock signal CLKF. The first-fifth sampling clock signals SCLK1-SCLK5, that are delayed by a transfer sampling time tTS from the first-fifth transfer signals TCLK1-TCLK6, respectively, are generated by the seven delay elements 831-837. FIGS. 25G-25K illustrate the first-fifth transfer signals TCLK1-TCLK5, FIGS. 25L-25P illustrate the first-fifth sampling clock signals SCLK1-SCLK5, FIG. 25Q illustrates the latency signal LATENCY, and FIG. 25S illustrates the output data DOUT from the data output buffer 140.",
        "The internal read signal PREAD is latched by the D-flip flop 870 to generate the delayed version of the internal read signal called the pre-latency signal PRE-LATENCY. The pre-latency signal PRE-LATENCY is latched by the first-fifth latches 841-845 shown in FIG. 23 in response to the first-fifth sampling clock signals SCLK1-SCLK5. In this case, the pre-latency signal PRE-LATENCY at a high level is latched by the second and third latches 842 and 843 in response to the second and third sampling clock signals SCLK2 and SCLK3. The pre-latency signal PRE-LATENCY at a low level is latched by other latches. The first-fifth latches 841-845 maintain previous data up to a next latch point by the first-fifth sampling clock signals SCLK1-SCLK5.",
        "Data stored in the first-fifth latches 841-845 are generated as the latency signal LATENCY in response to the first-fifth transfer signals TCLK1-TCLK5, respectively. The latency signal LATENCY is enabled at a high level in response to the second and third transfer signals TCLK2 and TCLK3 and the latency signal LATENCY is disabled in a state of a low level in response to the fourth transfer signal TCLK4.",
        "The output data DOUT is output in synchronization with the data output clock signal CLKDQ while the latency signal LATENCY is enabled in the state of the high level. The output data DOUT in synchronization with the data output clock signal CLKDQ is output to a bus after tSAC.",
        "Output data D1 and D2 in synchronization with seventh and eighth clock cycles 8 and 9 of the data output clock signal CLKDQ are synchronized with seventh and eighth clock cycles 7 and 8 of the external clock signal ECLK and output to the bus. Since the valid output data DOUT is output in the seventh clock cycle 7 of the external clock signal ELCK in response to the external read command READ CMD which is input in the first clock cycle 1 of the external clock signal ELCK, the CAS latency is 6. Furthermore, as with previous embodiments, this embodiment is not limited to outputting the number of data words as described.",
        "This embodiment of the present invention supports a CAS latency of CL8 at a maximum. The latency circuit 500 may increase or decrease a maximum value of the CAS latency supported by the latency circuit 500 by increasing or decreasing the number of D-flip flops, delay elements, switches and latches. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the latency circuit 500 may adjust the CAS latency by adjusting the number and position of switches SW1-SW4 of the latency signal generator 820.",
        "As described above, in the timing diagrams of FIGS. 25A-25S, the internal clock signal PCLK is latched to create the delayed read signal PRE-LATENCY. Like the latency circuits of previous embodiments, the latency circuit of this embodiment then latches and stores the delayed internal read signal PRE-LATENCY using a plurality of sampling clock signals and generates the latched delayed internal read signal PRE-LATENCY as the latency signal LATENCY at a desired output clock CLKDQ based on a plurality of transfer signals. Also, the number and pulse interval of sampling clock and transfer signals generated according to the CAS latency makes a difference in timing or relationship therebetween.",
        "The invention can be modified in many ways. However, all such modifications obvious to one skilled in the art are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and are within the scope of the invention."
