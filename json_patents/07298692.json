        "The present invention relates to a radio base station apparatus and communication terminal apparatus used in a digital radio communication system.",
        "In recent years, attention has been drawn to an OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) transmission system high in resistance to multipath interference that is a main factor in deterioration of transmission performance on transmission paths. OFDM is such a system that multiplexes a large number of (a few tens to hundreds) digital modulated signals with frequencies orthogonal to each other at a signal interval.",
        "One of communication methods using OFDM transmission is disclosed in \u201cCoded OFDM System using Guard Interval Length Control\u201d IEICE, General Conference, B-5-92, 2001.",
        "In this communication method, a base station (described as an access point in the above document) receives a known signal (preamble) transmitted from a mobile apparatus (described as a mobile terminal in the above document) and using the known signal, generates a delay profile, while measuring Carrier to Noise ratio (C/N ratio). Using the delay profile and C/N ratio, the base station determines an optimal guard interval, the modulation level of M-ary modulation and coding rate of FEC (Forward Error Correction) to transmit over the downlink.",
        "Since the communication method employs a TDMA/TDD (Time Division Multiple Access/Time Division Duplex) system as an access scheme, the reversibility is used of transmission paths over the uplink (communication terminal to base station) and downlink (base station to communication terminal).",
        "The communication method employs OFDM over both the uplink and downlink. In OFDM, by increasing the duration of a symbol, effects of delayed versions are decreased. Accordingly, since the duration of a symbol is increased, time resolution is insufficient, and it is thereby impossible to measure a delay profile accurately. When a guard interval is determined based on a delay profile generated under such a condition that the time resolution is insufficient, there is a risk that an unnecessary time is also set as a guard interval and the spectral efficiency deteriorates.",
        "The present invention is carried out in view of the foregoing, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a radio base station apparatus and communication terminal apparatus that generate delay profiles with high accuracy to determine guard intervals so as to ensure the transmission quality while improving the spectral efficiency.",
        "The inventor of the present invention focused on that it is difficult to measure the delay profile using OFDM signals, found out by using the fact that delay profiles are not different between the uplink and downlink, the delay profile is generated with high accuracy using uplink DS/CDMA (Direct Sequence/Code Division Multiple Access) signals, and determining a guard interval using such a delay profile makes it possible to ensure the transmission quality and to improve the spectral efficiency, and reached the present invention.",
        "In other words, the object of the present invention is achieved by using OFDM signals or OFDM/CDMA signals over the downlink and CDMA signals over the uplink, generating delay profiles using the CDMA signals, and determining guard intervals using the delay profiles.",

Radio reception section 202 performs predetermined reception processing (such as, for example, downconverting and A/D conversion) on the uplink signal, and outputs the radio-reception-processing processed signal to despreading section 203.",

Demodulation section 204 demodulates the despread signal and outputs received data.",
        "Delay profile generating section 205 generates a delay profile using the despread signal. The delay profile is output to guard interval determining section 206. Using the delay profile, guard interval determining section 206 determines a guard interval. Information of the determined guard interval is output to Inverse Fourier Transform section 208.",
        "Transmission parameters such as the guard interval, subcarrier frequency interval and the number of subcarriers are inserted into a preamble portion of transmission data. Accordingly, a frame of downlink signal has a format as shown in FIG. 4, and includes a preamble portion and data portion. Transmission data including the preamble is modulated in modulation section 207, and the modulated signal is output to Inverse Fourier Transform section 208.",
        "Inverse Fourier Transform section 208 performs on the modulated signal OFDM processing (modulation) and Inverse Fourier Transform processing, for example, IDFT (Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform) and IFFT (Inverse Fast Fourier Transform), and outputs the IFT processed signal to radio transmission section 209. Radio transmission section 209 performs predetermined radio transmission processing (such as, for example, D/A conversion and upconverting) on the OFDM signal, and transmits the resultant radio signal to MS as a downlink signal through antenna 201.",

        "Fourier Transform section 303 performs on the radio-reception-processing processed signal OFDM processing (demodulation) and Fourier Transform processing, for example, DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) and FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), and outputs the FT processed signal to demodulation section 304. Demodulation section 304 demodulates the FT processed signal and outputs received data.",
        "The demodulated signal is output to transmission parameter extracting section 305. Transmission parameter extracting section 305 extracts a preamble portion from the demodulated signal, and recognizes transmission parameters from the preamble portion. The transmission parameters are output to Fourier Transform section 303. Fourier Transform section 303 performs Fourier Transform based on the transmission parameters transmitted from BS.",
        "Transmission data is modulated in modulation section 306, and the modulated signal is output to spreading section 307. Spreading section 307 performs spreading on the modulated signal with a predetermined spreading code, and outputs the spread signal to radio transmission section 308. Radio transmission section 308 performs predetermined radio transmission processing (such as, for example, D/A conversion and upconverting) on the spread signal, and transmits the resultant radio signal to BS as an uplink signal through antenna 301.",
        "A case will be described below where BS and MS with the above-mentioned configurations perform radio communications according to the present invention.",
        "MS as illustrated in FIG. 3 modulates transmission data, spreads the data in spreading section 307, and transmits the spread signal (CDMA signal) to BS as an uplink signal.",
        "When receiving the uplink signal (CDMA signal), BS despreads the CDMA signal in despreading section 203, and generates a delay profile using the despread signal in delay profile generating section 205.",
        "At this point, since CDMA signals have higher time resolution than OFDM signals, it is possible to generate a delay profile with high accuracy. In other words, as described above, in OFDM, the duration of a symbol is increased to decrease effects of delayed version, which becomes a factor in degrading the accuracy of delay profile generation. Meanwhile, in CDMA, since processing is performed for accurately detecting delayed versions to combine, it is necessary to generate delay profiles with accuracy for the processing. Further, since delayed versions are combined instead of decreasing effects of delayed versions, it is not necessary to increase the duration of a symbol to decrease effects of delayed versions, unlike OFDM. Therefore, CDMA signals have higher time resolution than OFDM signals. As a result, using CDMA signals is capable of generating delay profiles with higher accuracy than using OFDM signals.",
        "The delay profile generated in delay profile generating section 205 is output to guard interval determining section 206 and is used to determine a guard interval. Specifically, the guard interval in OFDM is set at a time interval to include delayed versions so as to prevent the reception quality from deteriorating due to the delayed versions. For example, as shown in FIG. 5, a guard interval is set at a time interval including a desired signal and a delayed signal.",
        "Thus determined guard interval is output to Inverse Fourier Transform section 208 as transmission parameter information of OFDM. Information of subcarrier frequency interval and of the number of subcarriers that are of other transmission parameters is also output to Inverse Fourier Transform section 208. These transmission parameters (guard interval, subcarrier frequency interval and the number of subcarriers) are inserted into a preamble portion of transmission data to broadcast MS.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 4, the preamble portion containing the transmission parameters is modulated as transmission data as well as a data portion, and subsequently undergoes Inverse Fourier Transform processing to be an OFDM signal. At this point, the Inverse Fourier Transform processing is performed based on the transmission parameters (guard interval, subcarrier frequency interval and the number of subcarriers) in which the guard interval determined as described above is reflected. The IFT processed OFDM signal is transmitted to MS as a downlink signal.",
        "When receiving the downlink signal, MS performs Fourier Transform processing on the preamble portion of the downlink signal to demodulate, and thus extracts transmission parameters inserted into the preamble portion. The transmission parameters (guard interval, subcarrier frequency interval and the number of subcarriers) are output to Fourier Transform section 303.",
        "Fourier Transform section 303 performs Fourier Transform processing on the data portion based on the extracted transmission parameters. The FT processed signal is demodulated in demodulation section 304, and output as received data.",
        "In this way, according to this embodiment, a CDMA signal is used to generate an accurate delay profile, and based on the delay profile a guard interval is determined, whereby the need is eliminated of setting a guard interval using an OFDM signal with insufficient time resolution and it is thereby possible to set guard intervals with high accuracy. It is thus possible to ensure the transmission quality while preventing a useless guard interval from being set and to improve the spectral efficiency.",

Modulation section 1011 modulates the coded transmission data, and outputs the modulated signal to Inverse Fourier Transform section 1012.",
        "Inverse Fourier Transform section 1012 performs Inverse Fourier Transform processing on the modulated signal, and outputs the IFT processed signal (OFDM signal) to radio transmission section 1013. Radio transmission section 1013 performs predetermined radio transmission processing (such as, for example, D/A conversion and upconverting) on the OFDM signal, and transmits the resultant radio signal to MS as a downlink signal through antenna 1001.",
        "FIG. 11 is a block diagram illustrating a configuration of MS according to the third embodiment of the present invention.",
        "A downlink signal transmitted from BS is received in radio reception section 1102 through antenna 1101. Radio reception section 1102 performs predetermined reception processing (such as, for example, downconverting and A/D conversion) on the downlink signal, and outputs the radio-reception-processing processed signal to Fourier Transform section 1103.",
        "Fourier Transform section 1103 performs Fourier Transform processing on the radio-reception-processing processed signal, and outputs the FT processed signal to demodulation section 1104 and received quality measuring section 1111. Demodulation section 1104 demodulates the FT processed signal and outputs the demodulated signal to decoding section 1107. Decoding section 1107 decodes the demodulated signal and outputs received data.",
        "The demodulated signal is output to transmission parameter extracting section 1105 and modulation scheme/coding rate extracting section 1106. Transmission parameter extracting section 1105 extracts a preamble portion from the demodulated signal, and recognizes transmission parameters from the preamble portion. The transmission parameters are output to Fourier Transform section 1103. Fourier Transform section 1103 performs Fourier Transform based on the transmission parameters transmitted from BS.",
        "Modulation scheme/coding rate extracting section 1106 recognizes information of the modulation scheme and coding rate from the preamble portion. The information of the modulation scheme is output to demodulation section 1104, while the information of the coding rate is output to decoding section 1107. Demodulation section 1104 performs demodulation based on the information of the modulation scheme transmitted from BS. Decoding section 1107 performs decoding based on the information of the coding rate transmitted from BS.",
        "Received quality measuring section 1111 measures C/I that is the received quality using the FT processed signal, and outputs the measurement result to modulation section 1108. The measurement result and transmission data is modulated in modulation section 1108, and the modulated signal is output to spreading section 1109. Spreading section 1109 performs spreading on the modulated signal with a predetermined spreading code, and outputs the spread signal to radio transmission section 1110. Radio transmission section 1110 performs predetermined radio transmission processing (such as, for example, D/A conversion and upconverting) on the spread signal, and transmits the resultant radio signal to BS as an uplink signal through antenna 1101.",
        "A case will be described below where BS and MS with the above-mentioned configurations perform radio communications according to the present invention.",
        "MS as illustrated in FIG. 11 measures the received quality of a preamble portion of a downlink signal in received quality measuring section 1111. Then, MS modulates the measurement result of the received quality and transmission data, spreads the modulated signal in spreading section 1108, and transmits the spread signal (CDMA signal) to BS as an uplink signal.",
        "When receiving the uplink signal (CDMA signal), BS despreads the CDMA signal in despreading section 1003, and generates a delay profile using the despread signal in delay profile generating section 1005. The delay profile is generated using the CDMA signal with high time resolution, and, therefore, is generated with high accuracy. Further, using the despread signal, Doppler frequency measuring section 1007 measures the Doppler frequency.",
        "The delay profile generated in delay profile generating section 1005 is output to guard interval determining section 1006. Guard interval determining section 1006 determines a guard interval as in the first embodiment. The guard interval is output to Inverse Fourier Transform section 1012 as the transmission parameter information of OFDM, and also to modulation scheme/coding rate selecting section 1009.",
        "The Doppler frequency (Doppler shift) measured in Doppler frequency measuring section 1007 is output to carrier interval selecting section 1008. Carrier interval selecting section 1008 selects the subcarrier interval based on the Doppler frequency. Further, carrier interval selecting section 1008 determines the number of subcarriers from a bandwidth used in radio communications and the subcarrier interval. The subcarrier interval and the number of subcarriers are output to Inverse Fourier Transform section 1012 as the transmission parameter information of OFDM, and also to modulation scheme/coding rate selecting section 1009.",
        "Modulation scheme/coding rate selecting section 1009 obtains the modulation scheme and coding rate from the guard interval, subcarrier interval, the number of subcarriers, and further the Doppler frequency and received quality of downlink. Specifically, the section 1009 determines the number of symbols transmitted in a single burst from the subcarrier interval, the number of subcarriers (subcarrier parameter) and guard interval, and based on the number of symbols and the Doppler frequency, further determines the optimal coding rate. For example, since the higher Doppler frequency better randomizes portions with poor quality of the received data at a single burst and thus provides higher error correcting capability, the coding rate is set to relatively high when the Doppler frequency is high. Meanwhile, when the Doppler frequency is low, the received signal strength sometimes decreases over the entire received burst, resulting in low error correcting capability, and therefore, the coding rate is set to relatively low. In addition, the optimal coding rate is predetermined by simulation. Further, the section 1109 determines the modulation scheme (the modulation level of M-ary modulation) from the received quality of the downlink measured in MS and the coding rate.",
        "The information of the guard interval, subcarrier frequency interval and the number of subcarriers that are of transmission parameters and also the information of the modulation scheme and coding rate is inserted into a preamble portion of transmission data to broadcast MS.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 4, the preamble portion containing the transmission parameters is coded as transmission data as well as a data portion, modulated and subsequently undergoes Inverse Fourier Transform processing to be an OFDM signal. At this point, the coding is performed with the coding rate selected as described above, and the modulation is performed with the modulation scheme selected as described above. Further, the Inverse Fourier Transform processing is performed based on the transmission parameters (guard interval, subcarrier frequency interval and the number of subcarriers) in which the guard interval determined as described above is reflected. The IFT processed OFDM signal is transmitted to MS as a downlink signal.",
        "When receiving the downlink signal, MS performs Fourier Transform processing on the preamble portion of the downlink signal to demodulate, and thus extracts transmission parameters and the information of the modulation scheme and coding rate inserted into the preamble portion. The transmission parameters (guard interval, subcarrier frequency interval and the number of subcarriers) are output to Fourier Transform section 1103. The information of the modulation scheme is output to demodulation section 1104, while the information of the coding rate is output to decoding section 1107.",
        "Fourier Transform section 1103 performs Fourier Transform processing on the data portion based on the extracted transmission parameters. The FT processed signal is output to demodulation section 1104, and therein demodulated based on the information of the extracted modulation scheme. The demodulated signal is output to decoding section 1107 and therein decoded based on the information of the extracted coding rate, and thus the received data is output.",
        "In this way, according to this embodiment, a CDMA signal is used to generate an accurate delay profile, and based on the delay profile a guard interval is determined, whereby the need is eliminated of setting a guard interval using an OFDM signal with insufficient time resolution and it is thereby possible to set guard intervals with high accuracy. It is thus possible to ensure the transmission quality while preventing a useless guard interval from being set and to improve the spectral efficiency.",
        "Further, according to this embodiment, it is possible to vary the modulation scheme and coding rate adaptively corresponding to the propagation path condition, and to flexibly response to the propagation environment to perform radio communications.",
        "In addition, while this embodiment describes using C/I as the received quality, the present invention is applicable to cases of using received quality parameters (such as SIR (Signal to Interference Ratio) and received power) besides C/I as the received quality.",
        "Further, while this embodiment describes the case where BS generates a delay profile and measures the Doppler frequency, the present invention allows MS to generate a delay profile, measure the Doppler frequency, and report the delay profile and Doppler frequency to BS.",
        "The third embodiment explains determining the optimal guard interval, carrier frequency interval and the number of carriers for each user, in consideration of the fact that the delay profile and Doppler frequency are different for each user.",
        "Over the downlink, signals for each user can be subjected to code multiplexing using OFDM/CDMA signals. In other words, over the downlink, it is possible to perform code multiplexing on information to users having the same transmission parameters (guard interval, the number of subcarriers and subcarrier interval) to transmit. However, it is not possible to perform code multiplexing on information with different transmission parameters.",
        "In this embodiment, transmission parameters (guard interval, the number of subcarriers and subcarrier interval) are set for each user. Then, in performing code multiplexing on signals for each user to transmit in a time slot, when there is a remaining code resource, different transmission parameters are adapted to transmission parameters being transmitted currently to perform transmission.",
        "Specifically, in a time slot for multiplexing data to users (a, b and c) with a delay time of a delayed signal of X, data of user d with a delay time of y (x>y) can be multiplexed. In this case, data of user d has a shorter guard interval than that of users a, b and c and therefore, can be transmitted at a high data rate, but is multiplexed and transmitted even though the transmission parameters are not optimal, in other words, the guard interval of user d is changed to the guard interval of users a to c to transmit the data of user d.",
        "In this way, it is possible to improve the using rate of code resource per one slot and to improve the system throughput.",
        "The present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned first to fourth embodiments, and is capable of being carried into practice with various modifications thereof. For example, the above-mentioned first to fourth embodiments are capable of being carried out in a combination thereof as appropriate.",
        "As described above, according to the present invention, OFDM signals or OFDM/CDMA signals are used over the downlink, CDMA signals are used over the uplink, delay profiles are generated using the CDMA signals, and guard intervals are determined using the delay profiles with high time resolution, whereby it is possible to ensure the transmission quality while improving the spectral efficiency.",
