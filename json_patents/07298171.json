        "The present invention relates, in general, to the field of integrated circuit logic circuits and devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to layout area efficient, high speed, dynamic multi-input exclusive OR (XOR) and exclusive NOR (XNOR) logic gate circuit designs of especial utility with respect to integrated circuit devices.",
        "Error correction circuitry (ECC) and other types of logic functions that make use of parity require XOR and the XNOR logic gate functions. These XOR and XNOR gates are more difficult to implement with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology than standard NAND and NOR logic gates, particularly when considering multi-input gates having more than two inputs. Conventional static three-input XOR circuits are generally slow and require many transistors. Representative implementations of various XOR logic gates are shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,749,886 issued Jun. 7, 1988 for \u201cReduced Parallel Exclusive OR and Exclusive NOR Gate\u201d, U.S. Pat.

No. 5,134,616 issued Jul. 28, 1996 for \u201cDynamic RAM with On-Chip ECC and Optimized Bit and Word Redundancy\u201d.

A representative number of inverters for furnishing the \u201c/A\u201d, \u201c/B\u201d and \u201c/C\u201d input signals are also illustrated. As is apparent, the number of transistors required to provide a conventional three-input XOR gate 400 soon grows to be unreasonably large, and possibly prohibitively so for conventional static designs of four or more inputs.",
        "With reference additionally now to FIG. 5, a schematic diagram of a dynamic three-input XOR/XNOR logic gate 500 in accordance with a particular implementation of the present invention is shown. The logic gate comprises, in pertinent part, a clocked latch circuit 502 comprising a pair of cross-coupled CMOS inverters 504 and 506 coupled to VCC and selectively couplable to circuit ground by an N-channel transistor 508. First and second nodes of the latch circuit 502 provide respective \u201cQ\u201d (XOR) and complementary \u201cQB\u201d (XNOR) outputs on lines 518 and 518B. Inputs to the logic gate 500 comprise \u201cA\u201d input 510, \u201cB\u201d input 512 and \u201cC\u201d input 514 as well as their complements, \u201cAB\u201d input 510B, \u201cBB\u201d input 512B and \u201cCB\u201d input 514B.",
        "The logic gate 500 is clocked by means of a clock (CLK) signal coupled to line 520 and its complement \u201cCLKB\u201d derived, for example, at the output of a CMOS inverter 522 on line 520B. The CLKB signal is supplied to the gate terminal of transistor 508.",
        "The logic gate 500 comprises first and second strings of series coupled N-channel transistors, with the first string including transistors 526AB, 530BBL and 534CBL while the second string comprises transistors 526A, 530BBR and 534CBR. The first string is selectively couplable to VCC through the enabling of P-channel transistor 524UL and to circuit ground through N-channel transistor 524LL, both of which receive the CLK signal at their gate terminal. Similarly, the second string is selectively couplable to VCC through the enabling of P-channel transistor 524UR and to circuit ground through N-channel transistor 524LR, both of which also receive the CLK signal at their gate terminal.",
        "An N-channel transistor 540BL has its source terminal coupled to a first intermediate node 528R at the drain of transistor 526A and its drain terminal coupled to a second intermediate node 532L at the drain of transistor 530BBL. In like manner, another N-channel transistor 540BR has its source terminal coupled to a first intermediate node 528L at the drain of transistor 526AB and its drain terminal coupled to a second intermediate node 532R at the drain of transistor 530BBR. Further, an N-channel transistor 542CL has its source terminal coupled to the second intermediate node 532R at the drain of transistor 530BBR and its drain terminal coupled to a third intermediate node 536L (\u201cQP\u201d) at the drain of transistor 534CBL. In like manner, another N-channel transistor 542CR has its source terminal coupled to the second intermediate node 532L at the drain of transistor 530BBL and its drain terminal coupled to a third intermediate node 536R (\u201cQPB\u201d) at the drain of transistor 534CBR. The first and second nodes of the latch circuit 502 are selectively couplable to the QP and QPB nodes 536L and 536R through N-channel transistors 538L and 538R respectively, which receive the CLK signal at their gate terminals.",
        "As illustrated the gate of transistor 526A receives the \u201cA\u201d input signal on line 510, the gate terminals of transistors 540BL and 540BR receive the \u201cB\u201d input signal on line 512, while the gate terminals of transistors 542CL and 542CR receive the \u201cC\u201d input signal on line 514. The complementary \u201cAB\u201d signal is supplied to the gate of transistor 526AB on line 510B, the complementary \u201cBB\u201d signal is supplied to the gate of transistors 530BBL and 530BBR on line 512B while the complementary \u201cCB\u201d signal is supplied to the gate of transistors 534CBL and 534CBR on line 514B.",
        "Functionally, when the CLK signal is \u201clow\u201d, the \u201cQP\u201d 536L and \u201cQPB\u201d 536R nodes are precharged \u201chigh\u201d, while outputs \u201cQ\u201d 518 and \u201cQB\u201d 518B are disconnected and allowed to remain latched at their previous levels. When the CLK signal transitions to a logic level \u201chigh\u201d, inputs \u201cA\u201d 510, \u201cB\u201d 512, \u201cC\u201d 514, \u201cAB\u201d 510B, \u201cBB\u201d 512B and \u201cCB\u201d 514B are evaluated and either node \u201cQP\u201d 536L or \u201cQPB\u201d 536R will go \u201clow\u201d. Since pass gate transistors 538L and 538R are now \u201con\u201d and coupled to nodes 536L and 536R, this information is transferred to the \u201cQ\u201d 518 and \u201cQB\u201d 518B nodes when the CLK transitions to logic level \u201clow\u201d again, that is, when the complementary CLKB signal goes \u201chigh\u201d. The output \u201cQ\u201d and \u201cQB\u201d levels are sensed and amplified through the latch circuit 502 devices.",
        "As previously described, at this time node \u201cQP\u201d 536L and \u201cQPB\u201d 536R are precharged and disconnected from the outputs \u201cQ\u201d 518 and \u201cQB\u201d 518B. The series coupled N-channel transistors 534CBL, 540BL, 530BBL, 526AB, 542CR, 530BBR, 540BR, 534CBR, 526A and 542CL are configured to pull down node \u201cQP\u201d 536L or \u201cQPB\u201d 536R when the CLK signal is \u201chigh\u201d according to the three input XOR truth table shown in FIG. 3B. It should be noted that the logic gate 500 performs both an XOR and XNOR function on the three inputs \u201cA\u201d 510, \u201cB\u201d 512 and \u201cC\u201d 514 since both the \u201cQ\u201d 518 and \u201cQB\u201d 518B outputs are made available.",
        "With reference additionally now to FIG. 6, a schematic diagram of a dynamic four-input XOR/XNOR logic gate 600 in accordance with a further implementation of the present invention is shown. In this illustration, like structure to that previously described with respect to the three-input XOR/XNOR gate 500 of FIG. 5 is like numbered and the foregoing description thereof shall suffice herefor.",
        "Utilizing the principles of the present invention, a four-input XOR/XNOR logic gate 600 can be readily provided through the addition of a \u201cD\u201d input 602 at the gate of additional N-channel transistors 608DL and 608DR and a complementary \u201cDB\u201d input 602B at the gate of additional N-channel transistors 606DBL and 606DBR added to the first and second transistor strings as shown. The transistor 608DR is coupled to an intermediate node 604L at the drain of transistor 534CBL and the \u201cQPQ\u201d node 536R. Similarly, the transistor 608DL is coupled to node 604R at the drain of transistor 534CBR and the \u201cQP\u201d node 536L. Transistor 606DBL is placed in series between transistors 524UL and transistor 534CBL while transistor 606DBR is placed in series between transistors 523UR and 534CBR. The four-input XOR/XNOR logic gate 600 shown operates in a manner analogous to the three-input XOR/XNOR logic gate 500 previously described.",
        "It should be further noted that, while a representative three-input XOR/XNOR logic gate 500 (FIG. 5) and a four-input XOR/XNOR logic gate 600 (FIG. 6) have been illustrated, the principles of the present invention are likewise applicable to five-input (and more) multi-input XOR/XNOR gates. For example, the four-input XOR/XNOR logic gate 600 can be readily expanded to a five-input gate by breaking the connections between the drain terminals of transistors 606DBL and 608DL with node \u201cQP\u201d 536L and the connections between the drain terminals of transistors 606DBR and 608DR with node \u201cQPB\u201d 536R. An additional N-channel transistor can then be placed in series between the drain terminal of transistor 606DBL with node \u201cQP\u201d 536L while a similar device is placed in series between the drain terminal of transistor 606DBR and node \u201cQPB\u201d 536R. The signal \u201cFB\u201d would then be input to the gate terminals of these devices. Another N-channel transistor would then be placed in series between the drain of transistor 608DR and node \u201cQP\u201d 536L while a similar device is place in series between the drain of transistor 608DL and node \u201cQPB\u201d 536R. The signal \u201cF\u201d would then be input to the gate terminals of these devices. Multi-input XOR/XNOR gates having even more inputs can be readily provided in the same manner.",
