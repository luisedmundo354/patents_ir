        "The present invention relates to a process for the purification of Chorionic Gonadotropin, in particular the purification of recombinant human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) from a sample of crude recombinant hCG. The method comprises the use of ion-exchange chromatography and reverse phase HPLC.",
        "Chorionic gonadotropin is a hormone produced by the placenta and traditionally obtained from the urine of pregnant women.",
        "The hormone is a heterodimer consisting of non-covalently bound \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. Its effects are predominantly those of the gonadotropin luteinising hormone.",
        "Chorionic gonadotropin is given to women to induce ovulation after follicular development has been stimulated with follicle-stimulating hormone or human menopausal gonadotropins in the treatment of anovulatory infertility due to absent or low concentrations of gonadotropins. A single dose of 5000 to 10000 units is given by intramuscular injection to mimic the midcycle peak of luteinising hormone which normally stimulates ovulation. Chorionic gonadotropin is also given in conjunction with menotrophin and sometimes also clomiphene citrate as an adjunct to in vitro fertilisation procedures and other assisted conception techniques involving superovulation and oocyte collection. In males it has been used in the treatment of prepubertal cryptorchidism. Regimens vary widely, but doses usually range from 500 to 4000 units three times weekly by intramuscular injection.",
        "It is also given for male infertility associated with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism Again, there is considerable variation in the dosage regimen, and doses have varied from 500 to 4000 units two to three times weekly. An agent with follicle-stimulating activity such as menotrophin is often added to enable normal spermatogenesis. For oligospeia, doses of up to 3000 units of chorionic gonadotropin weekly with menotrophin or another follicle-stimulating preparation may be employed. In the treatment of delayed puberty associated with hypogonadism in males, a dose of 500 to 1500 units is given twice weekly; the dose should be titrated against plasma-testosterone concentration.",
        "Different methods have been used to isolate and purify hCG from raw urine samples (Birken et al., Endocrinology, 133(3): 1390-7, 1993; Sakakibara et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 35(5): 1414-6, 1990; Donini et al., Acta Endocrinol., 73(1): 133-45, 1973). Recently, a different method of affinity chromatography, termed membrane filtration affinity chromatography, has been developed and applied to purify hCG from urine (Xu et al., Protein expression and purification, 16: 221-3, 1999). The method avoids the use of BrCN activated Sepharose as a solid-phase for the affinity chromatography column and represents a variation of the usual methods of purification of hCG by affinity chromatography from urine samples. Immunoactivity of the purified hCG according to this method is 8554 IU/mg.",
        "Recombinant hCG has the advantage of being devoid of other gonadotropin hormones and contaminants of human origin and more specifically of those present in human urine. The crude preparation of recombinant hCG contains, however, all other proteins and contaminants of the cell used in its recombinant production and a method for achieving an absolute purity of recombinant Chorionic Gonadotropin is highly desirable.",
        "We have now found that a crude preparation of hCG, deriving from a concentrated sample of a culture medium obtained after the recombinant process or from a crude concentrate of urine of pregnant women, can be purified such that the resulting hCG is practically free from proteins or other contaminants contained in the crude hCG preparation.",
        "The purification process is based on the use of ion-exchange chromatography and reverse phase HPLC. The possible further use of a size exclusion column allows the removal of any residual traces of contaminants. Optimum results are obtained when at least two steps of ion-exchange chromatography are performed.",
        "The process of the invention can be used for the purification of recombinant hCG from a crude preparation of the culture medium derived from the recombinant process. The r-hCG is obtained with a high degree of purity and high specific bioactivity (in the range of 23,000-28,000 IU/mg), practically free from Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) proteins, if present in the culture medium, and from nucleic acids or other contaminants contained in the host cells used in the recombinant process.",
        "The process of the invention can be used as well for the purification of urinary hCG, starting from a crude concentrate of urine of pregnant women, and for the purification of CG from other mammalian species including, for example, bovine, equine, porcine, ovine and monkey.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for purification of hCG from a sample comprising the use of ion-exchange chromatography and reverse phase HPLC.",
        "The process comprises the steps of subjecting the sample to ion-exchange chromatography and subjecting the eluate to reverse phase HPLC. A further step of applying the eluate to a size exclusion column may additionally be carried out.",

        "In a preferred embodiment of the invention, elution through the DEAE SEPHAROSE ion-exchange column is carried out in sodium phosphate buffer at about pH 7,5. Elution through the CM-SEPHAROSE (cross-linked agarose matrix with carboxymethyl weak anion exchanger) ion-exchange column is preferably carried out in sodium phosphate buffer at about pH 6.",
        "The reverse phase HPLC step (d) is preferably carried out with 2-propanol/Tris-phosphate buffer as mobile phase.",
        "The CG of the present invention is preferably human CG and most preferably is recombinant hCG, deriving from the culture medium of CHO cells used in the recombinant process.",
        "It is a further object of the present invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of purified recombinant hCG as prepared by the recombinant process as described above, together with suitable excipients. An example of a suitable excipient is sucrose, which aids in the stabilisation of the lyophilised product. The pharmaceutical composition of recombinant hCG is particularity suitable for subcutaneous administration.",
        "The invention provides a method for the purification of hCG, in particular for the purification of recombinant hCG from a crude preparation of the culture medium of the recombinant process. The r-hCG is obtained with a high degree of purity and high specific bioactivity (in the range of 23,000-28,000 IU/mg), practically free from Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) proteins which are present in the culture medium and from nucleic acids or other contaminants contained in the host cells used in the recombinant process.",
        "The invention is intended for use with biological materials, particularly crude mixtures containing hCG and other contaminating proteins referred to herein as starting material samples. The examples described in detail below use starting material samples containing r-hCG obtained from cell culture supernatant medium from a bioreactor. Alternatively, the sample is crude concentrated urine from pregnant women.",
        "The sample is constituted by freshly collecting cell culture supernatant medium perfused through a bioreactor over two days. Preferably the supernatant is clarified by filtration. If necessary, the crude solution is concentrated and subjected to C4 silica chromatography to remove contaminants derived from the cell culture.",
        "The semi-purified harvest, after ultrafiltration, is then subject to ion-exchange chromatography, which is preferably performed twice, and preferably under different conditions, and to reverse phase HPLC. A first DEAE SEPHAROSE ion-exchange step may be performed, essentially acting as an hCG \u201cflow through\u201d step, in which a large part of the non-hCG proteins and DNA are eliminated. A second ion-exchange step, preferably through a CM-SEPHAROSE column, acts as an hCG binding step, and removes residual DNA and host cell or medium protein contaminants. In a preferred embodiment this step is performed at about 5\u00b0 C. eluting with sodium phosphate buffer at about pH 6.",
        "Reverse phase chromatography on a Silica C18 column is effective in removing trace amounts of nucleic acids and cell culture derived contaminants. The column is preferably eluted with 2-propanol/Tris-phoshate buffer as mobile phase. The retentate solution is preferably then subjected to 10 kD cut-off ultrafiltration, concentrated and can be recovered with ammonium hydrogen carbonate pH 8. The concentrated product can then be applied to a size exclusion chromatography column on SEPHACRYL S200 HR. In this step, a separation based on molecular size is achieved eluting with ammonium hydrogen carbonate pH 8 to remove still possible trace amounts of cell culture derived contaminants, potential aggregates and free hCG sub-units. The eluate can then undergo a dialysis by ultrafiltration on membranes with 10 kD cut-off, preferably in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.
