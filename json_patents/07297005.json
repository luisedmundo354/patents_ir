        "The present invention relates to a connector pedestal for use in a connector assembly.",
        "In the electronics industry, packaging constraints are becoming ever more difficult. The size, weight, heat and location of electronic components are making these requirements an increasing challenge to designers. As such, it would be desirable to have a transition connector which can be used to either raise or lower the position of a connector with respect to a main printed wiring board. It would further be desirable to provide an interface to a mating connector which can be modified to accommodate the dimensions of the mating connector without changing or customizing the connector itself.",
        "The present invention provides such a transition connector in the form of a connector pedestal.",
        "A connector pedestal has a body including interior and exterior surfaces, upper and lower edges, and interface portion, and first and second sets of traces. The interface portion is provided proximate to the upper edge. The first set of traces extends along the interior surface from the upper edge to the lower edge and around the lower edge onto the exterior surface. The second set of traces extends along the exterior surface from the upper edge to the lower edge and around the lower edge onto the interior surface. The connector pedestal is formed by a two-shot or double-shot injection molding process.",
        "In a connector assembly, the connector pedestal is mounted to a main circuit board by the traces of the first and second sets proximate to the lower edge of the connector pedestal being soldered to the main circuit board. The connector assembly further includes a guide cage mounted to the main circuit board and a secondary circuit board which is positioned on and guided into position by the guide cage such that the secondary circuit board is positioned off of the main circuit board by a predetermined distance. A connector is further included which is secured to the secondary circuit board and connected to the interface portion of the connector pedestal.",

The second portion 44 is provided with the interface portion 26 proximate to the upper edge 40, which preferably spans an entire length of the second portion 44 from the first side edge 34 to the second side edge 36. The interface portion 26 has a reduced thickness across the entire length of the second portion 44 from the first side edge 34 to the second side edge 36 relative to the remainder of the second portion 44.",
        "The L-shaped body 28 of the connector pedestal 20 is provided with a first set 48 of traces 50 and a second set 52 of traces 54.",
        "The first set 48 of traces 50 are provided along the interior surface 30 of the L-shaped body 28 from the lower edge 38 to the upper edge 40. The first set 48 of traces 50 also extends around the lower edge 38 of the L-shaped connector 28 onto the exterior surface 32 of the L-shaped body 28, but preferably does not extend beyond the offset portion 46 of the first portion 42 of the L-shaped body 28. The first set 48 of traces 50 may also slightly extend around the upper edge 40 of the L-shaped connector 28 onto the exterior surface 32 of the L-shaped body 28, if desired.",
        "The second set 52 of traces 54 are provided along the exterior surface 32 of the L-shaped body 28 from the lower edge 38 to the upper edge 40. The second set 52 of traces 54 also extends around the lower edge 38 of the L-shaped connector 28 onto the interior surface 30 of the L-shaped body 28, but preferably does not extend beyond the offset portion 46 of the first portion 42 of the L-shaped body 28. The second set 52 of traces 50 may also slightly extend around the upper edge 40 of the L-shaped connector 28 onto the interior surface 30 of the L-shaped body 28, if desired.",
        "The traces 50, 54 which extend around the lower edge 38 of the first portion 42 of the L-shaped body 28 are defined as the solder or SMT feet 55 of the connector pedestal 20.",
        "The traces 50 of the first set 48 preferably alternate along the length of the L-shaped body 28 with the traces 54 of the second set 52, but are not required to alternate. For example, as best illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, one of the traces 50 of the first set 48 is provided next and proximate to the first side edge 34 of the L-shaped body 28, one of the traces 54 of the second set 52 is provided next to the trace 50 of the first set 48 which is provided next and proximate to the first side edge 34 of the L-shaped body 28, and another one of the traces 50 of the first set 48 is provided next to the trace 54 of the second set 48, and so forth, until another one of the traces 50 of the first set 48 is provided next and proximate to the second side edge 36 of the L-shaped body 28. It is to be understood that while it is described and illustrated that traces 50 of the first set 48 are provided next to and proximate to the first and second side edges 34, 36 of the L-shaped body 28, that it is possible, if desired, to have the traces 54 of the second set 52 be provided next to and proximate to the first and second side edges 34, 36 of the L-shaped body 28, or to have one of the traces 50 of the first set 48 be provided next to and proximate to one of the first and second side edges 34, 36 and to have one of the traces 54 of the second set 52 be provided next to and proximate to the other of the first and second side edge 34, 36.",
        "The connector pedestal 20 includes a first wing member 60 which is generally triangular in configuration such that it has an inner surface 62, an outer surface 64, and first, second and third side edges 66, 68, 70.

The bottom edge 70 of the first wing member 60 is proximately planar with the lower edge 38 of the L-shaped body 28.",
        "The first wing member 60 is preferably provided with a pair of positioning feet 72, 74 which extend downwardly from the third edge side 70 thereof. The positioning feet 72, 74 are preferably integrally formed with the third side edge 70 of the first wing member 60. The positioning foot 72 preferably extends downwardly from the third side edge 70 proximate to the connection of the first side edge 66 and the third side edge 70. The positioning foot 74 preferably extends downwardly from the third side edge 70 proximate to the connection of the second side edge 68 and the third side edge 70. The first wing member 60 is also preferably provided with a soldering foot 76 which extends downwardly from the third side edge 70 thereof, preferably between the positioning feet 72, 74.",
        "The connector pedestal 20 includes a second wing member 80 which is generally triangular in configuration such that it has an inner surface 82, an outer surface 84, and first, second, and third side edges 86, 88, 90. The first side edge 86 is connected at one end thereof to the second side edge 88 and at an opposite end thereof to the third side edge 90. The second side edge 88 is connected at one end thereof to the third side edge 90 and at an opposite end thereof to the first side edge 86. The third side edge 90, also referred to herein as a bottom edge 90 of the second wing member 80, is connected at one end thereof to the first side edge 86 and at an opposite end thereof to the second side edge 88. The second side edge 36 of the first portion 42 of the L-shaped body 28 of the connector pedestal 20 is secured to, and preferably integrally formed with, the inner surface 82 of the second wing member 80, with the connection of the first and second side edges 86, 88 of the second wing member 80 being provided proximate to the connection of the first and second portions 42, 44 of the L-shaped body 28.

        "The second wing member 80 is preferably provided with a pair of positioning feet 92, 94 which extend downwardly from the third side edge 90 thereof. The positioning feet 92, 94 are preferably integrally formed with the third side edge 90 of the second wing member 80. The positioning foot 92 preferably extends downwardly from the third side edge 90 proximate to the connection of the first side edge 86 and the third side edge 90. The positioning foot 94 preferably extends downwardly from the third side edge 90 proximate to the connection of the second side edge 88 and the third side edge 90. The second wing member 80 is also preferably provided with a soldering foot 96 which extends downwardly from the third side edge 90 thereof, preferably between positioning feet 92, 94.",
        "The connector pedestal 20 is preferably formed by a two-shot or double-shot injection molding process. In the two-shot injection molding process, a first cavity and core is provided into which a non-plateable or plateable thermoplastic is injected to form a first molded product. The first molded product stays on the core and is rotated to be placed into a second cavity as an insert and a plateable or non-plateable thermoplastic and is injected therein and molded against the first molded product, commonly known as overmolding, to form a second molded product formed of a combination of the non-plateable and plateable thermoplastics. The second molded product is then subjected to an etching process and electroless plating bath, such that metal from the electroless bath adheres only to the plateable thermoplastic of the second molded product.",
        "In the connector pedestal 20 of the present invention, nearly all of the L-shaped body 28 is formed with the non-plateable thermoplastic whereas only those portions of the L-shaped body 28 positioned below the first and second set 48, 52 of traces 50, 54 are formed with the plateable thermoplastic, such that the traces 50, 54 can be formed on the L-shaped body 28 by the electroless bath. Also, in the connector pedestal 20 of the present invention, nearly all of the first and second wing members 60, 80 are formed with the non-plateable thermoplastic whereas only those portions of the first and second wing members 60, 80 positioned proximate to the soldering feet 76, 96 can be formed on the first and second wing members 60, 80 by the electroless bath.",
        "The connector pedestal 20 is preferably utilized in a connector assembly 100, as best illustrated in FIGS. 3-5. The connector assembly 100 includes the connector pedestal 20, the connector 22, the main PWB 24, a guide cage 102, and a secondary circuit board 104.",
        "The connector pedestal 20 is mounted onto the main PWB 24 using conventional assembly and soldering techniques. The solder feet 55 are soldered to the main PWB 24, using standard surface mount technology (\u201cSMT\u201d) processing, thus securing the connector pedestal 20 to the main PWB 24.",
        "If the positioning and soldering feet 72, 74, 76; 92, 94, 96 of the first and second wing members 60, 80, respectively, of the connector pedestal 20 are provided, these may also be used to properly position the connector pedestal 20 to the main PWB 24, as well as to provide increased hold down strength of the connector pedestal 20 to the main PWB 24. If the first and second wing members 60, 80 are provided with the positioning and soldering feet 72, 74, 76; 92, 94, 96, respectively, the main PWB 24 preferably includes two separated pairs of apertures (not shown) therein. The connector pedestal 20 is mounted onto the main PWB 24 by positioning the positioning feet 72, 74 of the first wing member 60 into one of the pairs of apertures of the main PWB 24, and by positioning the positioning feet 92, 94 of the second wing member 80 into the other one of the pairs of apertures of the main PWB 24. The soldering feet 76, 96 are then soldered to the main PWB 24 using conventional techniques in order to secure the first and second wing members 60, 80, and thus the connector pedestal 20, to the main PWB 24.",
        "The guide cage 102, which is best illustrated in FIG. 3, includes a first guide member 106, a second guide member 108, and a plurality of cross-members 110 extending between the first and second guide members 106, 108. The bottom edges of the first and second guide members 106, 108 are mounted to the main PWB 24 using conventional techniques. The upper edges 112, 114 of the first and second guide members 106, 108 are preferably folded over inwardly toward one another and above the cross-members 110.",
        "The secondary circuit board 104 has an upper surface 116, a lower surface (not shown) and first, second, third, and fourth edges 120, 122, 124, 126. The secondary circuit board 104 is provided with various electronics thereon that must be interconnected to the main PWB 24. This is accomplished by mounting the connector 22, which is preferably an XFP connector, for instance a 70 position XFP connector, onto the upper surface 116 of the secondary circuit board 104 proximate to the first edge 120, and between the second and fourth edges 122, 126.",
        "The secondary circuit board 104, with the connector 22 mounted thereon, is slid/moved, with the first edge 120 leading, into the guide cage 102 between the first and second guide members 106, 108, and between the cross-members 110 and the folded-over upper edges 112, 114 of the first and second guide members 106, 108. The connector 22 is thus mounted on the secondary circuit board 104 in such a position that the connector 22 will mate with the interface portion 26 of the second portion 44 of the L-shaped body 28 of the connector pedestal 20, as this portion 26 has a reduced thickness, thus forming the completed connector assembly 100. The secondary circuit board 104 may preferably rest on the cross-members 110 of the guide cage 102. The first and second set 48, 50 of traces 52, 54 thus interconnect the electronics on the main PWB 24 to the electronics on the secondary circuit board 104, through the upper edge 40 of the pedestal connector 22. The upper edge 40 thereby is a substitute for having a connector to mate with the connector 22. Because it is not necessary to have a mating connector, the pedestal provides design flexibility as well as reduced overall system costs and complexity.",
        "It should be noted that the size of the connector pedestal 20 and the guide cage 102 can be varied depending on the desired distance to be provided between the main PWB 24 and the secondary circuit board 104.",
        "As best illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 5, which are rear views of the connector assembly 100, in partial and whole form, all of the traces of 50, 54 are exposed in the rear, on the exterior surface 32 of the offset portion 46 of the first portion 42 of the L-shaped body 28 of the connector pedestal 20, thus allowing for ease in inspection of the solder joints which join the traces 50, 54 to the main PWB 24. Thus, by using half the contacts in the connector 22, such as a 70 position XFP connector, it is possible to route the traces 50, 54 on the connector pedestal 20 in a way that all of the SMT contacts (traces 50, 54) soldered to the main PWB 24, are exposed on the rear of the connector pedestal 20. This eliminates the concern about inspection of the solder joints after assembly for joints that may be under the device.",
        "The first and second wing members 60, 80 are provided on the connector pedestal 20 in order to provide support for the connector assembly 100 both during assembly and use. As explained, the positioning and soldering feet 72, 74, 76; 92, 94, 96 may be provided on the first and second wing members 60, 80 in order to provide hold down strength as well as positioning of the connector assembly 100.",
        "The size of the interface portion 26 of the connector pedestal 20 can also be modified as desired, e.g., length, thickness, depth, etc., in order to accommodate the dimensions of the connector 22.",
        "While a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown and described, it is envisioned that those skilled in the art may devise various modifications without departing from the spirit and scope of the foregoing description and the attached claims."
