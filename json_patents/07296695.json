        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "Generally, the invention relates to a workroom storage system for organizing the tools and supplies found in workrooms, especially garages. More specifically, the invention relates to a space-efficient workroom storage system providing both wall mounted storage and cabinet storage, with a combination of slotwall panels, slot tracks, cabinets removably mounted to the slotwall panel and/or slot tracks, and a workbench in combination with mobile storage cabinets that are stowable beneath the workbench.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "There has long been a need for organized storage in workrooms, whether the workroom is a dedicated workshop, a garage, or any other room, since workrooms by their very nature tend to house many types of tools and equipment, along with general supplies and supplies for the tools and equipment. Past solutions to providing organized storage in workrooms were based on the operator selecting unrelated organization systems and combining them as operator saw fit, without an integrated system. The organization systems often reflected a hodgepodge of non-integrated solutions, such as fixed wall cabinets, pegboards, and workbenches with internal storage, which collectively did not provide a space-efficient solution. That is, the resulting combination of components comprising the operator-selected organization system, often consumed more space in the workroom than what was necessary, which limited the amount of storage and/or work area in the workroom. Therefore, there is still a need for a space-efficient, integrated workroom organization system that helps the operator maximize both the storage of tools and supplies and the useful area of the workroom.",
        "The invention provides a unique solution to the need for space-efficient, organized storage for a workroom via a workroom organization system comprising at least one slot track. The slot track has a plurality of slots with at least one undercut sidewall with adjoining slots forming a slat having edges defined by the slots. The slots further have a bottom wall generally parallel to and spaced inwardly from the face of the at least one slat. The organization system includes one or more removable mounting brackets having a support portion for attaching a device to the bracket. The mounting brackets include a first \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook on one edge of the support portion opening in a first direction to hook over an edge of a slat into the undercut sidewall. The mounting brackets include a second \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook on an opposite edge of the support portion opening in the first direction to hook over an edge of the adjoining slot into the undercut sidewall.",

The slots in the slotwall panel have a bottom wall generally parallel to and spaced inwardly from the face of the slats. The slot track has two slots with at least one undercut sidewall forming a slat having edges defined by the slots. The slots in the slot track have a bottom wall generally parallel to and spaced inwardly from the face of the slat. The organization system includes one or more removable mounting brackets usable on the slotwall panel and on the slot track. The mounting brackets include a support portion for attaching a device to the mounting bracket and a first \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook on one edge of the support portion opening in a first direction to hook over an edge of a slat into the undercut sidewall.

The slotwall panel and/or slot track can be formed of extruded polyvinyl chloride material. Co-pending patent application Ser. No. 10/747,421, discloses one such material, which patent application is incorporated by reference. The slotwall and/or slot track storage system according to the present invention can be used in a residential garage to provide storage for outdoor tools and equipment. A variety of storage options can be provided as will be described below. The slotwall and/or slot track storage system can also be used in a workroom or workshop, or in commercial and industrial locations.

        "Referring to FIG. 1, a slotwall panel 10 is shown. It should be understood that the slotwall panel 10 shown in FIG. 1 is only a portion of the panel that can extend longitudinally for any desired length. Typically, slotwall panels can be extruded in 8 feet long lengths to facilitate handling and installation. However, it should be understood that panels longer or shorter that 8 feet can fabricated and used. Further, a single panel can be used or an entire wall can be covered with panels as shown in FIG. 13. One embodiment of a hanger bracket 20 is shown mounted on the panel 10 and is shown with one example of a hook device 40 attached to the hanger bracket 20. Other well known and available hooks and hanging devices can be attached to one or more hanger brackets 20 as will be understood by one skilled in the art. While a few examples of types of hook and other storage devices that can be attached to one or more hanger brackets are disclosed in this application, one skilled in the art will understand that there are many available hooks and storage devices available on the market that could be used with the brackets and slotwall panels according to this invention.",
        "Mounting of hanger bracket 20 to a slotwall panel 10 can be understood by referring to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3. In FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 a device 40 has been omitted from hanger bracket 20 to more clearly show hanger bracket 20 on the slotwall panel 10. Those skilled in the art will understand that in use a hook device or other storage device would be attached to hanger bracket 20. Hanger bracket 20 includes a central support portion 21, a generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 22 extending from one edge of support portion 21, and a generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 23 extending from an opposite edge of support portion 21. Generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 22 includes a first leg 24 extending generally perpendicular from the edge of support portion 21 and a second leg 25 extending from the distal end of first leg 24 generally parallel to support portion 21. Generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 23 has a first leg 26 extending generally perpendicular from the edge of support portion 21 and a second leg 27 extending from the distal end of first leg 26 generally parallel to support portion 21 in the same direction as leg 25. Thus, hanger bracket 20 has two downward opening \u201cJ\u201d shaped hooks on opposite edges of support portion 21. Hanger bracket 20 also has a spring arm 28 extending from the edge of support portion 21 that divides generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 22 into two portions. Spring arm 28 extends in an opposite direction from leg 25. Referring to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 22 hooks over an edge 13 of a generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slat 12. Generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 23 hooks behind the lower adjacent half slat 16 in undercut 14. Spring arm 28 is positioned behind the upper adjacent slat 12 in undercut 14.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2, leg 27 bears against the underside of the lower adjacent half slat 16 in undercut 14 biased against the underside of the slat by the spring arm 28. The force of spring arm 28 holds support portion 21 out of contact with the face of slat 12. Thus, hanger bracket 20 transfers the load on a device 40 through hanger bracket 20 to slotwall panel 10 by contact of leg 24 on edge 13 of slat 12, the contact of leg 25 against the inside edge of slat 12 and the force of spring arm 28 against the inside of the upper adjacent slat 12 in undercut 14. Leg 26 of \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 23 does not normally contact edge 13 of lower adjacent slat 12. Referring to FIG. 3, when a load is placed on device 40 that generates a moment sufficient to overcome the bias of spring arm 28, hanger bracket 20 pivots on \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 22 so that leg 27 engages the bottom wall 15 of \u201cT\u201d shaped slot 11. When hanger bracket 20 is loaded, hanger bracket 20 transfers the load on a device 40 through hanger bracket 20 to slotwall panel 10 by contact of leg 24 on edge 13 of slat 12, the contact of leg 25 against the inside edge of slat 12, the force of spring arm 28 against the inside of upper adjacent slat 12 in undercut 14 and by contact of leg 27 against bottom wall 15 of generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slot 11. The length of leg 26 holds hanger bracket 20 spaced from the face of slat 12 when hanger bracket 20 is loaded by items carried on device 40 so that leg 27 rests against the bottom wall 15 of slot 11. In the event hanger bracket 20 is overloaded by items placed on device 40, the pressure on leg 24 may be sufficient to deform the edge 13 of slat 12 allowing hanger bracket 20 to move down until leg 26 engages edge 13 of lower adjacent slat 12. In an overload condition, the load is spread over two adjacent slats 12 by generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hooks 22 and 23 in addition to the load spread by spring arm 28 to upper adjacent slat 12 and leg 27 to the bottom wall 15. Thus, hanger bracket 20 is locked in position on slotwall panel 10 by friction due to spring arm 28 whether loaded or unloaded. Accordingly, hanger bracket 20 and its attached device, whether loaded or unloaded, can not inadvertently be knocked off or dislodged from a slotwall panel 10.",
        "Hanger bracket 20, together with any attached device such as device 40, can be mounted to a slotwall panel 10 by inserting spring arm 28 into the undercut 14 in a slot 11 far enough under the upper adjacent slat 12 for leg 25 to clear edge 13 of slat 12. Hanger bracket 20 can then be pivoted down against the moment of spring arm 28 until leg 27 clears the lower adjacent slat edge 13. Hanger bracket 20 can then be slid down over slat 12 until leg 25 rests on edge 13 with leg 27 bearing against the underside of the lower adjacent slat 12 in undercut 14. As mentioned above, hanger bracket 20 will be held in place by friction resulting from the moment of spring arm 28 bearing against the inside surface of the upper adjacent slat 12.",
        "Turning to FIG. 4, a slotwall panel 10 can include four generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slots 11 that form three generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slats 12 and two half slats 16, one on each edge of panel 10. One edge of slotwall panel 10 can include a projecting connecting rib 17 and the other edge can include a mating connecting groove 18. As shown in FIG. 1, rib 17 and connecting groove 18 connect adjacent panels and, when so joined, the half width slats 16 of the adjacent panels form a full width slat.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 4, the bottom wall 15 of the generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slots 11 includes a longitudinal alignment groove 19 in the center of bottom wall 15. Alignment groove 19 can facilitate mounting of slotwall panels on a wall. Alignment groove 19 can provide a locating function to allow screws or other mounting devices to be aligned along slotwall panel sections. In a wall installation, screws 29 (see FIG. 13) can be driven through the slotwall panel along groove 19 into studs supporting the wall to mount the slotwall panel or panels to the wall as is well known to those skilled in the art. Mounting of plural slotwall panels is facilitated by connecting rib 17 and connecting groove 18 since another slotwall panel can be placed on a slotwall panel already attached to a wall and the slotwall panel will remain in place until fastened to the wall by screws or other suitable fasteners. Normally slotwall panels 10 can be mounted to a wall with connecting rib 17 directed up and connecting groove 18 directed down over rib 17 of an adjacent panel 10 if an adjacent panel is already mounted. Those skilled in the art will recognize that slotwall panels 10 can be mounted to a wall in the opposite direction if so desired, i.e. with rib 17 directed down and connecting groove 18 directed up. Applicants have found that locating the joint between adjacent slotwall panels in the center of a slat provides a stronger slotwall structure since torsional loads are minimal in the center of a slat as compared to joint locations in a slot or at an edge of a slat.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4 through FIG. 4E, the dimensions of one embodiment of a slotwall panel 10 can be as provided in the following table.

When hanger brackets 20 are formed of steel, raised surfaces or bosses 44 as shown in FIG. 5 can be stamped in support portion 21 to provide attachment points for hook devices to be welded to the hanger bracket. After a hook device is attached to hanger bracket 20, the hanger bracket can be finished as desired such as by painting the entire hanger bracket and hook.",
        "Referring to FIG. 6B, spring arm 28 can extend up from first leg 24 at an acute angle of approximately 65\u00b0. As also shown in FIG. 6B the distal end 28\u2032 of spring arm 28 can be bent to extend generally parallel to support portion 21 and leg 25. Referring to the embodiment shown in FIG. 4 through FIG. 4E, FIG. 5 and FIG. 6B the function of spring arm 28 can be seen. The thickness e of a generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slat can be 7.0 mm and the offset E of spring arm 28 can be 6.6 mm. When a hanger bracket 20 is installed on a slotwall panel 10 with spring arm 28 positioned behind an adjacent generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slat in undercut 14 and generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 22 is hooked over an edge 13 of a generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slat, interference of the distal end of the spring arm 28 with the inside of the adjacent \u201cT\u201d shaped slat will tend to rotate hanger bracket 20 away from the face of slotwall panel 10. When generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 22 is hooked over and engages an edge 13 of a generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slat 12, hook 23 will be positioned adjacent edge 13 of a lower adjacent generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slat 12. Leg 27 will be positioned behind the lower adjacent generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slat 12 in undercut 14. The moment produced by spring arm 28 pressing against the inside of upper adjacent \u201cT\u201d shaped slat 12 will drive leg 27 into contact with the inner surface of lower adjacent generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slat 12 thus friction locking hanger bracket 20 in place. When a device such as a hook device 40 is attached to support portion and a load is placed on the hook device, the downward force on the hook device will drive hanger bracket 20 toward slotwall panel 10 until leg 27 engages the bottom wall 15 of the generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slot 11. The outside length D of leg 26 can be 12.1 mm and can be slightly greater than the depth d of undercut 14 which can be 5.0 mm plus the thickness e of slat 12 which can be 7.0 mm. Thus, hanger bracket 20 can be held out of contact with the face of slat 12 over which it is installed, whether loaded or unloaded. The distance A from the inside of first leg 24 of \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 22 to the inside of first let 26 of \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 23 can be 75.2 mm compared to the center to center spacing a of slots and slats which can be 76.2 mm. When hanger bracket 20 is installed on a generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slat 12 with leg 24 of \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 22 engaging an edge 13, leg 26 of \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 23 will not engage edge 13 of adjacent slat 12. Thus, hanger bracket 20 can pivot between the position shown in FIG. 2 to the position shown in FIG. 3 as a load is applied to hanger bracket 20 by an attached hook device such as 40.",
        "Referring to FIG. 7, FIG. 8 and FIG. 8A, a cabinet 50 is shown mounted on a slotwall panel 10. Cabinet 50 can be provided with another embodiment of hanger brackets mounted to one wall of cabinet 50. Cabinet brackets 30 can extend generally the full width of cabinet 50. Alternately, cabinet brackets 30 can extend less than the full width of cabinet 50 and multiple cabinet brackets 30 can be installed across the width of cabinet 50. Cabinet bracket 30 can include a support portion 31 for mounting the cabinet bracket 30 to a cabinet 50. A generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 32 can be provided on one edge of support portion 31. Another generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 33 can be provided on an opposite edge of support portion 31. Generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 32 can include a first leg 34 extending generally perpendicular to support portion 31 and a second leg 35 extending from the distal end of first leg 34 generally parallel to support portion 31. Generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 33 can include a first leg 36 extending generally perpendicular to support portion 31 and a second leg 37 extending from the distal end of first leg 36 generally parallel to support 31 and in the same direction as second leg 35. Cabinet brackets 30 can be dimensioned so that a cabinet bracket can be mounted to a slotwall panel without tipping the cabinet bracket 30. In order to mount a cabinet bracket without tipping the cabinet bracket 30, the length of second legs 35 and 37 should be less than width b the opening of \u201cT\u201d slots 11 in FIG. 4B. Similarly, the spacing of generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hooks 32 and 33 should correspond to center to center dimension a of the generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slots in FIG. 4.",
        "Referring to FIG. 8, the dimensions of one embodiment of a cabinet hanger bracket 30 adapted for use with a slotwall panel as shown in FIG. 4 through FIG. 4F can be as provided in the following table.

        "Cabinet brackets 30 can be formed of metal. Cabinet bracket 30 as shown in FIG. 8 can be formed of extruded aluminum cut to lengths corresponding to the width of the cabinet or device to which the particular cabinet bracket will be attached.",
        "As with the case of hanger bracket 20, cabinet bracket 30 can have a dimension A\u2032 from the inside of generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 32 to the inside of generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 33 that is slightly less than the center to center dimension a of the slotwall panel in FIG. 4. When dimension A\u2032 is slightly less than the center to center dimension a of slotwall panel, the load on cabinet bracket 30 produced by cabinet 50 will be on generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 32 and first leg 34 engaging edge 13 of generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slat 12. Because generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 32 engages an edge 13 of a generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slat 12 before generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 33, cabinet bracket 30 is held parallel to slotwall panel 10 and does not tip out at the top.",
        "Referring to FIG. 9 and FIG. 10, the operation of cabinet brackets 30 can be seen. As the load on cabinet bracket 30 is increased by the load placed in cabinet 50, the edge 13 of slat 12 under generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 32 deforms allowing generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 33 to engage edge 13 of adjacent slat 12 thus increasing support for the cabinet bracket. Thus, cabinet brackets 30 initially transfer the load of cabinet 50 through generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 32 to the slotwall panel 10 by engagement of leg 34 with edge 13 of a generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slat 12. Generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 33 only engages the lower adjacent generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slat 12 when the load in cabinet 50 is sufficient to deform edge 13 of slat 12 on which leg 34 is resting.",
        "Referring again to FIG. 8A, FIG. 11, FIG. 11A and FIG. 12 a plurality of square holes 39 can be provided in cabinet bracket 30 for mounting cabinet bracket 30 to cabinet 50. Cabinet 50 can be provided with a plurality of mounting holes 51 adjacent the top of cabinet 50 for a top cabinet bracket spaced to correspond to the spacing of mounting holes 39 in cabinet bracket 30. Mounting holes 51 can be round to permit mounting of a top cabinet bracket 30 in a fixed position adjacent the top of cabinet 50. One or more additional rows of mounting holes 52 can be provided below mounting holes 51 to allow mounting of one or more lower cabinet brackets 30. Mounting holes 52 can be vertically elongated slots to permit vertical adjustment of the lower cabinet brackets to insure that each cabinet bracket upper generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 32 engages a slat edge 13.",
        "In order to install a cabinet 50 on a slotwall panel, a top cabinet bracket can be attached to cabinet 50 utilizing a plurality of mounting bolts 55 inserted with the head in cabinet bracket 30 and the threaded portion projecting through mounting holes 51 into cabinet 50. Mounting bolts can be a carriage bolt or similar fastening device that can be tightened without access to the head. Suitable fasteners, not shown, can be threaded on mounting bolts 55 and tightened to secure top cabinet bracket 30 to cabinet 50. Next, one or more lower cabinet brackets can be attached to cabinet 50 utilizing a plurality of mounting bolts 55 inserted with the head in cabinet bracket 30 and the threaded portion projecting through vertical slot mounting holes 52 into cabinet 50. Suitable fasteners, not shown can be threaded on mounting bolts 55 and left loose to permit adjustment of the position of the one or more cabinet brackets 30 on cabinet 50 relative to the slotwall panel 10. Cabinet 50 can then be mounted on slotwall panels that have mounted or attached to a wall structure. The top cabinet bracket 30 is first hooked on a selected slotwall panel slat 12 with leg 34 engaging a slat edge 13. Next, the lower cabinet bracket or brackets 30 are vertically adjusted so that each generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 32 engages a slotwall panel slat 12 with leg 34 engaging a slat edge 13. After the one or more lower cabinet brackets 30 are all positioned hooked over a slotwall panel slat 12 with leg 34 engaging a slat edge 13 the fasteners can be tightened securing the one or more cabinet brackets to the cabinet 50. As mentioned above, the vertically elongated mounting holes provide sufficient vertical adjustment to allow multiple cabinet brackets to be employed for mounting a cabinet to a plurality of slotwall panels 10 with each cabinet bracket transferring load from the cabinet 50 to the slotwall panel to spread the load in cabinet 50 across multiple slotwall panels 10 and slats 12.",
        "Referring to FIG. 13, hanger brackets 20 can be combined to support plural mounting hooks 40\u2032. FIG. 13 also illustrates yard tools carried on the mounting hooks on a slotwall storage system occupying a section of a wall. As shown in FIG. 13, slotwall panels 10 can be fastened to a wall using a plurality of fasteners such as screws 29. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 13 a plurality of screws 29 are fastened through the slotwall panels 10 in each slot 11 spaced apart by the distance between underlying studs or wall support structures. Those skilled in the art will understand that fasteners 29 can be used in alternate generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slots 11, or other patterns as desired depending on the anticipated loading on the slotwall panels 10. Likewise, fasteners 29 could be driven into alternate studs or wall supports. The specific mounting hooks shown and the yard tools carried are only examples to show how the slotwall storage system can be used. Those skilled in the art will understand that many other hooks or storage devices could be attached to one or more hanger brackets to store any desired objects. In the embodiment of FIG. 13, two hanger brackets can be connected with a pair of connecting rods 41 to which three mounting hooks 40\u2032 are attached. The connecting rods can be welded to hanger brackets 20 and mounting hooks 40\u2032 can be welded to connecting rods 41. The combined mounting hook device can be mounted on a slotwall panel 10 in the same manner as a single hanger bracket as described above. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the combined mounting hook device shown in the embodiment of FIG. 13 is only one possible arrangement of multiple mounting hooks and that more or less than three mounting hooks could be attached to two or more connected hanger brackets.",
        "Referring to FIG. 14, a cabinet bracket 30 can be attached to a shelf 42 to support shelf 42 on slotwall panels 10. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 14, a cabinet bracket 30 can be attached to shelf 42 using threaded fasteners as used in connection with the cabinet as described above, or permanently attached to shelf 42 by welding. Shelf 42 can be mounted on slotwall panel 10 by inserting \u201cJ\u201d shaped hooks 32 and 33 into adjoining slots 11 and sliding shelf 42 and cabinet bracket 30 down over adjoining slat edges 13.",
        "As one of skill in the art should recognize, hanger brackets 20 can be combined to support a basket (not shown) on slotwall panels 10. In the embodiment two hanger brackets 20 can be attached to a basket by welding or by any other known connection means. The basket can be mounted on a slotwall panel in the same manner as a single hanger bracket as described above in detail.",
        "Referring to FIG. 15 and FIG. 16, another embodiment of a slotwall panel 10\u2032 is shown. In the embodiment of FIG. 15 and FIG. 16 repeating ruler markings 45 and 46 can be provided on the bottom wall 15 of generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slot 11\u2032 on either side of groove 19\u2032. Ruler markings 45 can be repeating 1-16 inch marks while ruler markings 46 can be repeating 1-24 inch marks. Repeating ruler markings can facilitate mounting of slotwall panels on conventional stud wall construction. Once a stud is located for a mounting screw 29, adjacent screws can be inserted at the same number in the repeating sequence as the first screw since most stud walls are built on 16 inch or 24 inch centers. The provision of the repeating markings eliminates the need to measure and mark the location of subsequent studs for mounting screws once the first mounting screw 29 is driven into a stud.

Another embodiment of a hook device 40\u2032 is shown in FIG. 13. Other well known and available hooks and hanging devices can be attached to one or more hanger brackets 20 as will be understood by one skilled in the art. While a few examples of types of hook and other storage devices that can be attached to one or more hanger brackets are disclosed in this application, one skilled in the art will understand that there are many available hooks and storage devices available on the market that could be used with the brackets and slot tracks according to this invention.",
        "Mounting of hanger bracket 20 to a slot track 210 can be understood by referring to FIG. 29. The slot track 210 as shown in FIG. 28 through FIG. 32 can include the same slot and slat geometry as a slotwall panel 10 as described conjunction in FIG. 1 through FIG. 4, and can be used in conjunction with the same hanger brackets 20 that can be used with slotwall panels 10. Referring to FIG. 29 generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 22 hooks over an edge 213 of a generally \u201cT\u201d shaped slat 212. Generally \u201cJ\u201d shaped hook 23 hooks behind lower edge 216 in undercut 214. Spring arm 28 is positioned behind upper edge 216 in undercut 214. Hanger bracket 20 interacts with slot track 210 in the same way as with a slotwall panel 10 as described above in connection with FIG. 1 through FIG. 4. Thus, hanger bracket 20 is locked in position on slot track 210 by friction due to spring arm 28 whether loaded or unloaded. Accordingly, hanger bracket 20 and its attached device, whether loaded or unloaded, can not inadvertently be knocked off or dislodged from a slot track 210.",
        "Hanger bracket 20, together with any attached device such as device 40, can be mounted to a slot track 210 by inserting spring arm 28 into the undercut 214 in a slot 211 far enough under the upper edge 216 for leg 25 to clear edge 213 of slat 212. Hanger bracket 20 can then be pivoted down against the moment of spring arm 28 until leg 27 clears the edge 213 of lower edge 216. Hanger bracket 20 can then be slid down over slat 212 until leg 25 rests on edge 213 with leg 27 bearing against the underside of the lower edge 216 in undercut 214. Thus, hanger bracket 20 can mount on slot track 210 the same as hanger bracket 20 mounts on a slotwall panel 10, see FIG. 2. As mentioned above, hanger bracket 20 will be held in place by friction resulting from the moment of spring arm 28 bearing against the inside surface of the upper edge 216 in undercut 214. For convenience in describing attaching of a bracket 20 to a slot track 210, edges 216 have been described as upper and lower edges 216. Slot track 210 as shown in the embodiment of FIG. 28 through FIG. 32 can be symmetrical so that \u201cupper\u201d and \u201clower\u201d has no significance other than a reference to understand the description since slot tracks 210 can be mounted on a wall with either edge \u201cup\u201d.",
        "Referring to FIG. 30 and FIG. 31, the dimensions of one embodiment of a slot track 210 can be as provided in the following table. It should be understood that the following dimensions are approximate and that slotwall panels having different dimensions can be provided in accordance with the invention as desired.",

        "Hanger brackets 20 as described above in FIG. 2, FIG. 5 and FIG. 6A including the dimensions of the embodiment of a hanger bracket 20 described in conjunction with those figures can be used with a slot track as shown in FIG. 28 through FIG. 32. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the dimensions referenced above are approximate and that a hanger bracket having different dimensions can be provided in accordance with the invention as desired for use with slot tracks having different dimensions.",
        "Turning to FIG. 32, another embodiment of slot track 310 is mounted on an edge of a slotwall panel 10. When slotwall panels 10 are used to cover less than a full wall of a workroom, the upper or lower edge of a slotwall panel 10 can present a connecting rib 17 or a connecting groove 18 on the exposed edge(s) of the slotwall panel(s) 10. In order to provide a finished edge, a slot track 310 having a half slat 316\u2032 on one edge can be provided. Slot track 310 can include a connecting groove 318 on one edge adjacent half slat 316\u2032 in order to mate with the connecting rib 17 of a slotwall panel 10. The dimensions of the half slat 316\u2032 and connecting groove 318 can be the same as the corresponding components of a slotwall panel 10 described above. While slot track 310 is shown with a connecting groove 318 on one edge, those skilled in the art will appreciate that slot track 310 can be provided with a connecting rib, not shown, on one edge in lieu of connecting groove 318 in order for the slot track 310 to mate with an exposed connecting groove 18. Should a connecting rib, not shown, be provided it can have the same dimensions as the connecting rib 17 included in slotwall panels 10. Those skilled in the art will understand that slot tracks 310 having a connecting rib and other slot tracks having a connecting groove can be provided for use with slotwall panels having both edges exposed to form a finished storage system.",
        "FIG. 33 illustrates a modular workbench storage system 110 in combination with a slot track storage system in a workroom. The modular workbench storage system 110 can include a heavy duty workbench and storage space for one or more modules that can dock underneath the workbench to minimize the area of the consumed in the room and thereby maximize the useful area of the workroom all as described above in connection with FIG. 19 through FIG. 27. When combined with the slot track storage system and wall-mounted storage cabinet previously described, the workbench storage system provides the operator of a workroom with a highly flexible and very space-efficient storage system. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 33, a plurality of slot tracks 210 are shown mounted on a wall of the workroom. Some of the slot tracks 210 have one or more hangers 40 installed on the slot tracks. Three wall cabinets 50 are shown mounted on a pair of slot tracks 210 mounted on the workroom wall over the workbench system 110. Slot tracks 210 can be mounted on the workroom wall spaced so that wall cabinets can be mounted in the same manner as wall cabinets are mounted on slotwall panels as described above in connection with FIG. 7 through FIG. 12. Wire form shelves 42\u2032 having brackets 20 can be mounted on the workroom wall for storing items off the floor of the workroom.",
        "FIG. 34 illustrates another embodiment of workroom having a modular workbench storage system 110 in combination with a slotwall and slot track storage system in a workroom. The workroom in this embodiment has a plurality of slot tracks 210 mounted on a wall of the workroom, and also has a plurality of slotwall panels 10 covering a portion of one section of a wall of the workroom. A pair of the slot tracks 210\u2032 and 210\u2033 are shown mounted to align with slots in a slotwall panel 10. In addition, a slot track 310 is shown positioned at the top of series of slotwall panels to provide a finished top edge. When one or more slot tracks 210 are mounted adjacent one or more slotwall panels with slots in the slot tracks aligned with slots in the slotwall panel, devices such as a wall cabinet 50 can be installed partially on a slotwall panel and partially on a slot track. Slot tracks 210 can be dimensioned so that they can be mounted on a wall spaced apart an even number of slot track widths apart with the slots 211 lined up with slots 11 of a slotwall panel 10. Then, if desired, additional slot tracks 210 can be added between slot tracks already mounted on a wall, in each case with slots 211 aligned with the slots 11 of a slotwall panel 10. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that one or more slot tracks 210 can be mounted at any convenient height on a wall of a workroom to support hanger brackets for storing tools and equipment in the workroom, or for supporting shelves, baskets or other storage devices.",
