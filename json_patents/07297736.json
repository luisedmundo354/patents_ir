        "The present invention relates to polymer blends comprising at least one polycarbonate and at least one polyester. More particularly, the present invention relates to polymer blends comprising polycarbonate(s) derived from bisphenol A and a polyester(s) derived from aromatic dicarboxylic acid(s), neopentyl glycol, and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol.",
        "The polycarbonate of 4,4\u2032-isopropylidenediphenol (bisphenol A polycarbonate) is a well known engineering molding plastic. Bisphenol A polycarbonate is a clear, high-performance plastic having good physical properties such as dimensional stability, high heat resistance, and good impact strength. Although bisphenol-A polycarbonate has many good physical properties, its relatively high melt viscosity leads to poor melt processability and the polycarbonate exhibits poor chemical resistance.",
        "Blends of polymers display different physical properties based upon the nature of the polymers blended together as well as the concentration of each polymer in the blend. Attempts have been made to blend bisphenol-A polycarbonate with other polymers that have good chemical resistance, processability, and machinability. These attempts to improve melt processability, chemical resistance and other physical properties of bisphenol-A polycarbonate have been made by blending bisphenol A polycarbonate with polymers such as polystyrene, elastomers, polyesters, and polyesterimides. However, blends of bisphenol-A polycarbonate with other polymeric materials usually have resulted in immiscible blend compositions. Immiscible blend compositions are inadequate for many uses because they are not clear.",
        "Clear, miscible blends of any two polymers are rare. The term \u201cmiscible\u201d refers to blends that are a mixture on a molecular level wherein intimate polymer-polymer interaction is achieved. Miscible blends are clear, not translucent or opaque. In addition, differential scanning calorimetry testing detects only a single glass transition temperature (Tg) for miscible blends composed of two or more components.",
        "There have been very few clear polycarbonate/polyester blends developed U.S. Pat. No. 6,043,322 discloses clear blends of bisphenol-A polycarbonate and polyesters of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, ethylene glycol, and 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutanediol. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,619,976 and 4,645,802 disclose clear blends based on bisphenol A polycarbonate with polyesters of poly(1,4-tetramethylene terephthalate), poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) and selected copolyesters and copoly(esterimides) of poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate). U.S. Pat. No. 4,786,692 discloses clear blends of bisphenol-A polycarbonate and polyesters of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, ethylene glycol, and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,188,314 and 4,391,954 disclose clear blends of bisphenol A polycarbonate with poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate-co-isophthalate).

        "The polyesters included in the present invention are prepared by procedures known to persons skilled in the art. The reaction of the diol, dicarboxylic acid, and branching monomer components may be carried out using conventional polyester polymerization conditions. For example, when preparing the polyester by means of an ester interchange reaction, i.e., from the ester form of the dicarboxylic acid components, the reaction process may comprise two steps. In the first step, the diol component and the dicarboxylic acid component, such as, for example, dimethyl terephthalate, are reacted at elevated temperatures, typically, about 150\u00b0 C. to about 250\u00b0 C. for about 0.5 to about 8 hours at pressures ranging from about 0.0 kPa gauge to about 414 kPa gauge (60 pounds per square inch, \u201cpsig\u201d). Preferably, the temperature for the ester interchange reaction ranges from about 180\u00b0 C. to about 230\u00b0 C. for about 1 to about 4 hours while the preferred pressure ranges from about 103 kPa gauge (15 psig) to about 276 kPa gauge (40 psig). Thereafter, the reaction product is heated under higher temperatures and under reduced pressure to form the polyester with the elimination of diol, which is readily volatilized under these conditions and removed from the system. This second step, or polycondensation step, is continued under higher vacuum and a temperature which generally ranges from about 230\u00b0 C. to about 350\u00b0 C., preferably about 250\u00b0 C. to about 310\u00b0 C. and, most preferably, about 260\u00b0 C. to about 290\u00b0 C. for about 0.1 to about 6 hours, or preferably, for about 0.2 to about 2 hours, until a polymer having the desired degree of polymerization, as determined by inherent viscosity, is obtained. The polycondensation step may be conducted under reduced pressure which ranges from about 53 kPa (400 torr) to about 0.013 kPa (0.1 torr). Stirring or appropriate conditions are used in both stages to ensure adequate heat transfer and surface renewal of the reaction mixture. The reaction rates of both stages are increased by appropriate catalysts such as, for example, alkoxy titanium compounds, alkali metal hydroxides and alcoholates, salts of organic carboxylic acids, alkyl tin compounds, metal oxides, and the like. A three-stage manufacturing procedure, similar to that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,631, may also be used, particularly when a mixed monomer feed of acids and esters is employed.",
        "To ensure that the reaction of the diol component and dicarboxylic acid component by an ester interchange reaction is driven to completion, it is sometimes desirable to employ about 1.05 to about 2.5 moles of diol component to one mole dicarboxylic acid component. Persons of skill in the art will understand, however, that the ratio of diol component to dicarboxylic acid component is generally determined by the design of the reactor in which the reaction process occurs.",
        "In the preparation of polyester by direct esterification, i.e., from the acid form of the dicarboxylic acid component, polyesters are produced by reacting the dicarboxylic acid or a mixture of dicarboxylic acids with the diol component or a mixture of diol components and the branching monomer component. The reaction is conducted at a pressure of from about 7 kPa gauge (1 psig) to about 1379 kPa gauge (200 psig), preferably less than 689 kPa (100 psig) to produce a low molecular weight polyester product having an average degree of polymerization of from about 1.4 to about 10. The temperatures employed during the direct esterification reaction typically range from about 180\u00b0 C. to about 280\u00b0 C., more preferably ranging from about 220\u00b0 C. to about 270\u00b0 C. This low molecular weight polymer may then be polymerized by a polycondensation reaction.

Preferred catalyst metals include titanium and manganese and most preferred is titanium. The amount of catalytic metal used may range from about 5 to 100 ppm but the use of catalyst concentrations of about 5 to about 35 ppm titanium is preferred in order to provide polyesters having good color, thermal stability and electrical properties.

When colored sheet or film is desired, pigments or colorants may be included in the polyester mixture during the reaction of the diol and the dicarboxylic acid or they may be melt blended with the preformed polyester. A preferred method of including colorants is to use a colorant having thermally stable organic colored compounds having reactive groups such that the colorant is copolymerized and incorporated into the polyester to improve its hue. For example, colorants such as dyes possessing reactive hydroxyl and/or carboxyl groups, including, but not limited to, blue and red substituted anthraquinones, may be copolymerized into the polymer chain. When dyes are employed as colorants, they may be added to the polyester reaction process after an ester interchange or direct esterification reaction.",
        "The polymer blends of the present invention are characterized by a novel combination of properties which preferably include polymer blends having a clearness or clarity or haze value measured on \u215b inch (3.2 mm) molded samples of about 0.2 to 3.0 percent as determined by a HunterLab UltraScan Sphere 8000 using Hunter's Universal Software, where % Haze=100*DiffuseTransmission/TotalTransmission. Diffuse transmission is obtained by placing a light trap on the other side of the integrating sphere from where the sample port is, thus eliminating the straight-thru light path. Only light scattered by greater than 2.5 degrees is measured. Total transmission includes measurement of light passing straight-through the sample and also off-axis light scattered to the sensor by the sample. The sample is placed at the exit port of the sphere so that off-axis light from the full sphere interior is available for scattering. Regular transmission is the name given to measurement of only the straight-through rays\u2014the sample is placed immediately in front of the sensor, which is approximately 20 cm away from the sphere exit port\u2014this keeps off-axis light from impinging on the sample. The polymer blends also exhibit an ASTM D648 a Heat Deflection Temperature, at 455 kilopascals bar (kPa\u201466 pounds per square inch\u2014psi), of about 80 to 130\u00b0 C., an ASTM D256 Notched Izod Impact Strength Flexural at 23\u00b0 C. of about 50 to 1250 joules/m (1 to 25 foot-pounds/inch), an ASTM D790 Modulus of about 700 to 3500 kPa (100 to 500 psi), an ASTM D790 Flexural Strength of about 5000 to 15000 psi. The tensile properties of the blend determined according to ASTM D638 at 23\u00b0 C. comprise a yield stress of about 31 to 69 megapascal (Mpa\u2014about 4500 psi to 10000 psi), a break stress of about 31 to 69 MPa (about 4500 psi to 10000 psi), and a break strain of at least 50%.",
        "The polyester blend may also be formed into film or sheet using many methods known to those skilled in the art, including but not limited to extrusion and calendaring. In the extrusion process, the polyesters, typically in pellet form, are mixed together in a tumbler and then placed in a hopper of an extruder for melt compounding. Alternatively, the pellets may be added to the hopper of an extruder by various feeders, which meter the pellets in their desired weight ratios. Upon exiting the extruder the now homogenous copolyester blend is shaped into a film. The shape of the film is not restricted in any way. For example, it may be a flat sheet or a tube. The film obtained may be stretched, for example, in a certain direction by from 2 to 6 times the original measurements.",
        "The stretching method for the film may be by any of the methods known in the art, such as, the roll stretching method, the long-gap stretching, the tenter-stretching method, and the tubular stretching method. With the use of any of these methods, it is possible to conduct biaxial stretching in succession, simultaneous biaxial stretching, uni-axial stretching, or a combination of these. With the biaxial stretching mentioned above, stretching in the machine direction and transverse direction may be done at the same time. Also the stretching may be done first in one direction and then in the other direction to result in effective biaxial stretching.",
        "In a general embodiment, the polymer blends of the invention are useful in making calendared film and/or sheet on calendaring rolls. The polymer blend may also comprise one or more plasticizers to increase the flexibility and softness of calendared polyester film, improve the processing of the polyester, and help to prevent sticking of the polyester to the calender rolls. The invention also provides a process for film or sheet by calendering the novel polymer blends and for the film or sheet produced from such calendering processes. The calendered film or sheet typically have a thickness in the range of about 2 mils (0.05 mm) to about 80 mils (2 mm).",
        "While the inherent viscosity (I.V.) of the polyesters of the present invention is generally from about 0.4 to about 1.4 dL/g, other I.V.s are contemplated within the scope of this invention. The inherent viscosity, abbreviated herein as \u201cI.V.\u201d, refers to inherent viscosity determinations made at 25\u00b0 C. using 0.25 gram of polymer per 50 mL of a solvent composed of 60 weight percent phenol and 40 weight percent tetrachloroethane. The basic method of determining the I.V. of the polyesters herein is set forth in ASTM method D2857-95. To obtain superior calendering line speeds, the polyesters of the present invention preferably have an inherent viscosity of about 0.55 to about 0.75 dL/g. Other examples of I.V. values which may be exhibited by the polymer blends are about 0.55 to about 0.70 dL/g, about 0.55 to about 0.65 dL/g, and about 0.60 to about 0.65 dL/g.",

        "In the calendaring process, higher molecular weight plasticizers are preferred to prevent smoking and loss of plasticizer during the calendering process. The preferred range of plasticizer content will depend on the properties of the base polyester and the plasticizer. In particular, as the Tg of the polyester as predicted by the well-known Fox equation (T. G. Fox, Bull. Am. Phys. Soc., 1, 123 (1956)) decreases, the amount of plasticizer needed to obtain a polymer blend that may be calendered satisfactorily also decreases. Typically, the plasticizer comprises from about 5 to about 50 weight percent (weight percent) of the polymer blend based on the total weight of the polymer blend. Other examples of plasticizer levels are about 10 to about 40 weight percent, about 15 to about 40 weight percent, and about 15 to about 30 weight percent of the polymer blend.",

The reactants were heated first at 200\u00b0 C. for 2 hours with agitation and then at 260\u00b0 C. for 0.5 hour. The pressure then was reduced at a rate of 13 Torr per minute and the temperature was increased to 270\u00b0 C. When the pressure reached 4 Torr, the polymerization mixture was maintained at 270\u00b0 C. for varying lengths of time (Polym Time in Table I). At the conclusion of the polymerization period, the pressure of the polymerization vessel was increase to ambient pressure with a nitrogen purge. The polymer was extruded and pelletized. The resultant compositions and inherent viscosity of these copolyesters are shown in Table I wherein NPG/CHDM are the mole percentages of NPG and CHDM residues present in polymer, the values for DMT, NPG and CHDM are the amounts in kg of each reactant utilized in the polymer preparation and the values given for Ti are parts per million by weight Ti present in the polymer.

        "The copolyesters listed in Table I were blended with a bisphenol A polycarbonate powder (MAKROLON 2608) and a phosphorus additive. The copolyesters were dried at 80\u00b0 C. and the bisphenol A polycarbonate were dried at 100\u00b0 C. overnight. The phosphorus concentrate was prepared by first hydrolyzing Weston 619, a distearyl pentaerythritol diphosphite available from GE Specialty Plastics, by melting it and soaking it in water and allowing the excess water to evaporate. The bisphenol A polycarbonate then is added to the now-hydrolyzed molten Weston 619 at ambient temperature and mixed until it a homogeneous solution is formed.
