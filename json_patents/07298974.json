    "description": [
        "The present invention relates to a fiber optic communication system, a wavelength tunable light source unit thereof, a network-node equipment having a wavelength tunable optical receiver unit installed, and a central processing unit and a computer program thereof, that are applied to a geographically-distributed iDC (Internet Data Center) implemented for a local administrative network, and to an IX (Internet exchange) network, and in which, by changing the wavelengths of optical signals used for the connection between network-node equipments, the logical network topology can be easily reconfigured on M network-node equipments (M is an integer no smaller than 2, nor greater than M) that are connected to a uniform-loss and cyclic-frequency (ULCF) arrayed wavelength grating (AWG) having N inputs and N outputs (N is an integer greater than or equal to 2).",
        "Conventionally, the amount of traffic traveling through fiber optic communication networks has been steadily changing and increasing explosively as is represented by data centers. Moreover, the number of network-node equipments accommodated on a fiber optic communication network and the types of data are becoming various, and it is becoming necessary to dynamically change the network topology, connection configuration, or even traffic capacity. For instance, in the current local public network described in \u201cProposal for local electronic government synergistic IDC operation for local electronic government implementation\u201d (Chikafumi Shimura, Local management newsletter, vol. 34, June 2001, Nomura Research Institute), there has been a call for: interconnection of municipal networks having different network topologies; installation of additional network-nodes or network-node removal; network topology reconfiguration following organizational integration or organizational expansion; and dynamic implementation of wavelength path reconfiguration in order to bypass failures. Also, there has been a strong call for integration of networks having different network topologies while maintaining their securities, and for superposing and operating networks having different signal formats and operation policies simply and inexpensively. Accordingly a fiber optic communication system has been expected in which connections with any network-node can be selectively established and logical network topologies can be arbitrarily reconfigured, by changing the wavelength of optical signals used for the connection between network nodes, by a wavelength tunable light source unit and a wavelength tunable optical receiver unit installed on network-node equipments in a fiber optic communication network that is physically connected to a uniform-loss and cyclic-frequency (ULCF) arrayed wavelength grating (AWG) in a star-shape via an optical wave guide such as an optical fiber (see also: K. Kato et al, \u201c32\u00d732 full-mesh (1024 path) wavelength-routing WDM network based on uniform-loss cyclic-frequency arrayed-waveguide grating\u201d, Electronics Letters, vol. 36, 1294-1296, 2000).",
        "On the other hand, in investigations so far, networks are being advanced in which the connection configuration of optical wave guided paths such as optical fibers, which are transmission paths, physically has a ring topology (for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2001-285323, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei 7-202845, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2001-184408).",
        "For example, the network-node equipment disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication Hei 7-202845 is constructed as shown in FIG. 4-37. An optical splitter (4-1) is one which splits an input optical signal into two regardless of its wavelength. An optical signal having eight wavelengths which is transmitted through the optical fiber is input thereto, and signals are output to an optical filter 4-2, a fixed-wavelength receiver unit A (4-4), and a fixed-wavelength receiver unit B (4-11).",
        "The optical filter 4-2 has a function of intercepting from among the optical signals of eight wavelengths outputted from the optical splitter 4-1, two wavelengths, \u03bbs (short wavelength) and \u03bbe (long wavelength) that the network terminal transmits and receives, and transmitting the other wavelengths.",
        "An optical combiner 4-3 combines the optical signals of six wavelengths transmitted from the optical filter 4-2 and optical signals of two wavelengths (\u03bbs, \u03bbe) outputted from a wavelength tunable transponder unit A (4-7) and a wavelength tunable transponder unit B14, and transmits them to optical fibers (not shown). The optical signals transmitted are inputted to the optical splitter 1 of the neighboring network-node equipment via an optical fiber (not shown in the diagram).",
        "The fixed-wavelength receiver unit A (4-4) comprises a fixed-wavelength optical filter and a photodetector, and has a function of receiving only the optical signal of wavelength \u03bbs from among the optical signals of two wavelengths (\u03bbs, \u03bbe) outputted from the optical splitter 4-1, and converting the signal into an electrical signal. Similarly, the fixed-wavelength receiver unit B (4-11) receives only the optical signal of wavelength \u03bbe, and converts it into an electrical signal.",
        "Selectors A and B (4-5 and 4-12) respectively reference received destination information assigned to the received data, and output the received data to a data processing module if the received data is addressed to the own network-node equipment. Also, if the received data is not addressed to the own network-node equipment and is to be relayed, the received data is outputted to a predetermined dual port memory of memory units A and B according to the received destination information.",
        "Memory units A and B (4-6 and 4-13) have two dual port memories for data that specifies the wavelength of launched optical signal for every wavelength of launched optical signal, and one dual port memory for the data that does not specify the wavelength of launched optical signal.",
        "The wavelength tunable transponder units A and B (4-7 and 4-14) have a function to convert the transmitted data into an optical signal and transmit it with two respective wavelengths: wavelength \u03bbs and wavelength \u03bbe. The wavelength tunable transponder unit A (4-7) is paired with the fixed-wavelength receiver unit A, and the wavelength tunable transponder unit 4-14 is paired with the fixed-wavelength receiver unit B (4-11).",
        "A data processing module 4-8 of the network-node equipment performs the requested process for the data transmitted from other network-node equipment while performing processes such as assigning received destination information for the data that is to be transmitted from the own network-node equipment to another network-node equipment, and outputs the data to the memory unit A (4-6) or the memory unit B (4-13).",
        "An end of transmission detection unit 4-9 detects the transmission end of the data stored in each of the dual port memories of the memory unit A (4-6) and the memory unit B (4-13), and outputs a wavelength switch signal to a wavelength controlling unit 4-10. The wavelength controlling unit 4-10 controls the oscillating wavelengths used for the wavelength tunable transponder units A and B to be \u03bbs and \u03bbe, by regulating the injection current of a tunable laser diode (hereunder referred to as TLD), which is described later.",
        "However, when designing a network or changing a network configuration, although there are methods for configuring a plurality of different virtual LANs (VLAN) as different respective logical network topologies in the reconfiguration of logical network topologies, in the installation of a new network-node equipment or removal of network-node equipment, and in the reconfiguration of a logical network topology in order to circumvent failure, there is complexity in each of the various kinds of settings, and a few months to six months is required for the construction. Also these operations have required a lot of work and there has been the problem of the risk of network collapse and so forth caused by human error. Moreover, although it has been possible, by using technology such as traffic engineering (TE) that is capable of selecting routes. according to the amount of traffic, to reconfigure the logical network-topology according to the load on the network, cases in which the amount of traffic exceeds expected traffic are conceivable, such as distributing live concert video images or providing information in a time of disaster, and the complexity of network setting operations and the problems in stable network operation still remain for the present technology. Moreover cases in which it has been necessary to review and reconfigure the physical network topology that have been determined according to the connection configuration of optical fibers have not been few.",
        "Also, the same is true even with reconfiguration of logical network topology using wavelength path by wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology, and this operation also requires work, and dynamic and quick reconfiguration of a logical network topology has been comparatively difficult.",
        "When automatizing in order to treat these problems, although a collective management method by central-management-equipment or a method of assigning a setting to each individual equipment are common, in the former method, since multiple control information is required to control the wavelength tunable light source and wavelength tunable filter that are provided for the network-node equipments, then when performing network topology reconfiguration, the number of network-node equipments and the load on the central-management-equipment increase, and fast topology reconfiguration has been made difficult. Moreover, in the latter method, since settings for the wavelength tunable light source and the wavelength tunable filter need to be assigned separately to different network-node equipments, the load on the network administrator has increased in initial network configuration or in network reconfiguration when changing the network topology.",
        "Furthermore, in the network system described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No Hei 7-202845 mentioned above, in which a management method is explained, a network-node equipment autonomously performs controls related to search and determination of the wavelength of optical signals used for connection with other network-node equipments. However the two wavelengths to be used are not regulated to be just two successive adjacent wavelengths, and when the case of connections with many network-node equipments using more than two wavelengths is considered, there is concern of an increase in processing time required for the data processing module in the network-node equipment shown in FIG. 4-34.",
        "However, in actual fiber optic communication systems, topology reconfiguration needs to be performed promptly according to changes in traffic pattern or efficient network usage, and in terms of stable network operation it is preferable not to require a long time from the start of the topology reconfiguration to its completion, and it has been desirable that high-speed topology reconfiguration be made possible.",

        "Network-node equipment and a physical network topology that is physically connected via optical fibers of an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) of a first embodiment according to the fiber optic communication system of the present invention is shown in FIG. 1-1.",

Also, each of the network-node equipments 1-401 to 1-405 is provided with a device of switching the wavelength of optical signals used for communication (not shown in the diagram).",
        "FIG. 1-2 is an example of connecting the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101 and each network-node equipment 1-401 to 1-405 by two-core optical fibers, and FIG. 1-3 is an example of connecting the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101 and each network-node equipment 1-401 to 1-405 by single-core optical fibers.",
        "This has a construction in which each of the optical input/output ports 1-201 to 1-205 and 1-301 to 1-305 of the provided arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) are connected by optical fibers 1-501 to 1-505 to the network-node equipments 1-401 to 1-405 disposed in the periphery.",
        "In the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG)1-101, optical signals 1-601 to 1-605 that are transmitted from each network-node equipment 1-401 to 1-405 and inputted to the optical input ports 1-201 to 1-205, are outputted for each of their wavelengths to the optical output ports 1-301 to 1-305 that correspond to the wavelengths.",
        "In this way, optical signals having wavelengths set in the destination (transmission destination) network-node equipment 1-401 to 1-405 may be switched and selected and transmitted from each of the network-node equipments 1-401 to 1-405, and logically a star-shaped (mesh-shaped) network topology as shown in FIG. 1-4 or a different logical network topology such as a ring-shaped network topology as shown in FIG. 1-5 can be easily realized, while physically having a simple star-shaped configuration as in the physical network topology shown in FIG. 1-1.",
        "FIG. 1-4 and FIG. 1-5 respectively show an image of the signal transmission route (wavelength path) and the logical network topology configuration of the communication route.",
        "When the star-shaped (mesh-shaped) logical network topology shown in FIG. 1-4 is to be configured, the connection relationships, which are based on the wavelengths of the optical signals of the optical input/output ports 1-201 to 1-205 and 1-301 to 1-305 in the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101, and the wavelengths of the optical signals used on each network-node equipment 1-401 to 1-405 need only to be set according to the wavelength allocation in FIG. 1-6. In FIG. 1-4, the wavelengths highlighted with hatching are to be used.",
        "When the ring-shaped logical network topology shown in FIG. 1-5 is to be configured, the connection relationships, which are based on the wavelengths of the optical signals of the optical input/output ports 1-201 to 1-205 and 1-301 to 1-305 in the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101, and the wavelengths of the optical signals used on each network-node equipment 1-401 to 1-405 need only to be set according to the wavelength allocation in FIG. 1-7. In FIG. 1-5, the wavelengths highlighted with hatching are to be used.",
        "Changing a group of network-node equipments that configure a logical network topology into another logical network topology can be achieved by having each network-node equipment switch the wavelengths of the optical signals in accordance with the wavelength allocation for the other logical network topology.",

        "A second embodiment according to the fiber optic communication system of the present invention is shown in FIG. 1-8 to FIG. 1-10. In the present embodiment, the characteristics of the present invention are described in detail, taking as an example a method of extending the fiber optic communication system.",
        "The second embodiment is a case where a simple physical star-shaped network topology configuration as shown in FIG. 1-8 is realized on a small scale. Here, a case is shown in which five base stations 1-402A to 1-406A provided with network-node equipments 1-402 to 1-406 are connected to a center base station 1-401A having the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101 described in the first embodiment.",
        "FIG. 1-9 shows the physical network configuration when the network configuration shown in FIG. 1-8 is extended and the number of network-node equipments is increased, and FIG. 1-10 shows the configuration of the logical network topology in the configuration of FIG. 1-9.",
        "The fiber optic communication network shown in FIG. 1-9 is an example providing extended base stations 1-407A to 1-418A having network-node equipments 1-407 to 1-418 that are connected to the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101 of the center base station 1-401 A. Also, in the fiber optic communication network shown in FIG. 1-9, as shown in FIG. 1-10: a ring-shaped logical network topology is configured with base stations 1-401A and 1-402A and extended base stations 1-407A and 1-408A; a star-shaped logical network topology is configured with base stations 1-401A and 1-406A and extended base stations 1-413A to 1-416A; a ring-shaped logical network topology is configured with base stations 1-401A and 1-405A and extended base stations 1-409A to 1-412A; and a star-shaped logical network topology is configured with base stations 1-401A, 1-403A and 1-404A and extended base stations 1-417A and 1-418A. Furthermore, a star-shaped (mesh-shaped) logical network topology is configured with base stations 1-401A and 1-405A and extended base stations 1-412A and 1-418A.",
        "When actually configuring a network, a large-scale network such as that shown in FIG. 1-9 is not usually constructed in the initial stage of network construction, and it is usual to expand the scale of the network step by step from a network configuration such as the one shown in FIG. 1-8, by expansion of the scale of the network while the network is operating. In the second embodiment, taking the scale of the number of optical input/output ports of the arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG) 1-101 disposed in the center as an upper limit, according to the network configuration in FIG. 1-8, when extending, by connecting the network-node equipments 1-407 to 1-418 to the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101 via optical fibers to establish additional extended base stations 1-407A to 1-418A, the size of the network can be easily upscaled without interrupting or stopping the communication status of the network-node equipments 1-401 to 1-406 that have already been established.",
        "Furthermore, since not only a star-shaped (mesh-shaped) logical network topology but also a ring-shaped logical network topology can be easily configured in the network configuration of the present embodiment as shown in the first embodiment (FIG. 1-1) above, a fiber optic communication system can be constructed in which different logical network topologies such as a mesh-shaped one, a star-shaped one, and a ring-shaped one coexist on the same star-shaped physical star network topology, as shown in FIG. 1-10.",
        "In the present configuration, since the network-node equipments that are to be connection destinations can be selected simply by changing the wavelengths of the optical signals that each of the network-node equipments 1-401 to 1-418 transmit and receive, then when reconfiguring a logical network topology, reconnection of optical fibers in the initial physical network configuration does not require a long time and high-cost construction work is not required, so that the logical network topology can be reconfigured extremely easily in a short period of time at low cost. Moreover, the logical network topology may also be reconfigured by changing the wavelength allocation of the optical input/output ports in the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101.",
        "A third embodiment according to the fiber optic communication system of the present invention is shown in FIG. 1-11 to FIG. 1-14. FIG. 1-11 shows a physical network topology that is a physical network configuration, and FIG. 1-12 shows the logical network topology thereof. Also, FIG. 1-13 is a diagram that describes in detail the logical configuration in the network configuration of the third embodiment, and FIG. 1-14 is a diagram showing the wavelength allocation relationships of the optical input/output ports of an arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101 of the third embodiment. Here an example of application to an Internet data center (iDC) network is described.",
        "Specifically, data centers 1-701A to 1-705A provided with network-node equipments 1-701 to 1-705 are connected via optical fibers to a center base station 1-101 A provided with the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101, and base stations 1-706A to 1-713A provided with network-node equipments 1-706 to 1-713 are connected via optical fibers to the center base station 1-101A.",
        "Also, according to the setting of the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101 and the wavelengths of the optical signals of each of the network-node equipments 1-701 to 1-713, the data centers 1-701A to 1-705A configure a mesh-shaped logical network topology and form a distributed data-center WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) core network 1-721, and the network-node equipments 1-701 to 1-705 of the data centers 1-701A to 1-705A and the network-node equipments 1-706 and 1-710 form a MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) core network 1-722 (Full-mesh logical network topology). Moreover, the network-node equipments 1-706 to 1-709 form a RPR (Resilient Packet Ring) network 1-723 (ring-shaped logical network topology), and the network-node equipments 1-710 to 1-713 form an ether network 1-724 (star-shaped logical topology), and then an inter-building connection network 1-725 created by point-to-point connection in a simple star-shaped configuration is formed between the network-node equipment 1-707 and the network-node equipment 1-713.",
        "As described in the first and second embodiments above, the present embodiment is characterized not only in that the logical network topology can combine a star-shaped (mesh-shaped) logical network topology and a ring-shaped logical network topology despite being a simple star-shaped physical network topology such as that shown in FIG. 1-11, but also in that MPLS (Multi-protocol Label Switching), which is widely known as a routing control method, and a networking technology called RPR (Resilient Packet Ring), which is known as a system that realizes a high-speed method of circumventing failures, can be superposed, and a network in which the network-node equipments 1-701 to 1-705 of the data centers 1-701A to 1-705A are distributed, and an extremely stable and highly secured network such as Internet exchange (IX), can be constructed in an extremely simple manner in a short period of time at low cost.",
        "In FIG. 1-14, node numbers 1 to 16 denote port numbers of the optical input/output ports of the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101, and in the present embodiment, the respective optical input/output ports having each of node numbers 1 to 13 are connected to the network-node equipments 1-701 to 1-713, and the wavelength allocation of optical signals for each of the network-node equipments 1-701 to 1-713 is set. In this case, as mentioned above, the number of optical input/output ports of the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) (N) and the number of network-node equipments (M) respectively correspond to the case where N=16 and M=13.",
        "According to this wavelength allocation, as shown in FIG. 1-11 and 1-12, the network-node equipments 1-706 to 1-709 connected to the ring-shaped logical network topology are connected to the network-node equipments 1-701 to 1-705 of the data centers 1-701A to 1-705A configured with a mesh-shaped logical network topology. At this time, the network-node equipments 1-701 to 1-705, 1-706, and 1-710 are LSR (Label Switch Routers) of the MPLS, and the network-node equipment 1-706 is a LSR (Label Switch Router) boundary of the MPLS. Also, the network-node equipments 1-710 to 1-713 easily realize a logical network configuration that is connected in a simple star-shape, and the network-node equipments 1-710 to 1-713 are connected to the network-node equipments 1-701 to 1-705 of the mesh-connected data centers 1-701A to 1-705A. At this time, the network-node equipment 1-710 is a LSR (Label Switch Router) boundary of the MPLS.",
        "Moreover, in the present embodiment, as shown in FIG. 1-14, wavelengths \u03bb1 to \u03bb9 are used in the MPLS core network 1-721 configured with the mesh-shaped logical network topology, wavelengths \u03bb12 to \u03bb16 are used in the PRP network 1-723 configured with the ring-shaped logical network topology, wavelengths \u03bb4 to \u03bb9 are used in the ether network 1-724 configured with the star-shaped logical topology, and wavelength \u03bb3 is used in the inter-building connection network 1-725.",
        "Here, although the wavelength allocation shown is for a case where the AWG disposed as the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101 disposed at the center base station is of a scale having 16\u00d716 optical input/output ports, of course this scale is not limited to 16\u00d716, and needs only to be greater than the capacity size of the network-node equipment.",
        "Next, a fourth embodiment according to the fiber optic communication system of the present invention is described, with reference to FIG. 1-15 and FIG. 1-16. The fourth embodiment describes an example case in which a new network-node equipment 714 is additionally inserted into the configuration of the above mentioned third embodiment. FIG. 1-15 is a diagram showing the logical network topology of the fourth embodiment, and FIG. 1-16 is a diagram showing the wavelength allocations of the optical input/output ports of the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101 of the fourth embodiment. In FIG. 1-16 the network-node equipments and the arrayed-waveguide grating are shown physically connected via optical fibers so that unique numbers 1 to 16 assigned to network-node equipments match to port numbers of optical input/output ports of the arrayed-waveguide grating 1-101. Moreover the wavelength allocations of optical signals at each of network-node equipments 1-701 to 1-714 has been set. This case corresponds to a case in which the number of network-node equipments is 14.",
        "In the present embodiment, the new network-node equipment 714 is additionally inserted between the network-node equipment 1-708 and the network-node equipment 1-709 in the ring-shaped logical network topology of the RPR network 1-723 of the above-mentioned third embodiment. In this case, as shown in FIG. 1-16, whereas the optical signal of wavelength \u03bb16 was used for the communication between the network-node equipment 1-708 and the network-node equipment 1-709 before reconfiguration, only the setting of the wavelengths of the optical data-signals of each of the network-node equipments 1-708, 1-709 and 1-714 needs to be changed in order to use the wavelength \u03bb5 for communication between the network-node equipment 1-708 and the network-node equipment 1-714, and to use the wavelength \u03bb6 for the communication between the network-node equipment 1-709 and the network-node equipment 1-714. In this manner, the new network-node 714 can be easily established in the network by simply changing the wavelength of the optical data-signals of the network-node equipments 1-708, 1-709 and 1-714. Here, although the wavelength allocation shown is for a case where the AWG disposed as the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101 is of a scale having 16\u00d716 optical input/output ports, as related in the above example, of course this scale is not limited to 16\u00d716, and needs only to be greater than the capacity size of network-node equipment.",
        "Next, a fifth embodiment according to the fiber optic communication system of the present invention is described, with reference to FIG. 1-17 and FIG. 1-18. The fifth embodiment is an example of transferring the network-node equipment 1-707 that has existed in the ring-shaped logical network topology of the RPR network 1-723, to the ether network 1-724 configured with a star-shaped logical topology in the above mentioned fourth embodiment. FIG. 1-17 is a diagram showing the logical network topology of the fifth embodiment, and FIG. 1-18 is a diagram showing the wavelength allocations of the optical input/output ports of the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101. In FIG. 1-18, as related above, the network-node equipments and the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) are shown physically connected via optical fibers so that unique numbers 1 to 16 assigned to network-node equipments match to port numbers of optical input/output ports of the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101. Moreover the wavelength allocations of optical signals at each of network-node equipments 1-701 to 1-714 have been set. This case, as related above, corresponds to a case in which the number of network-node equipments is 14.",
        "In the present embodiment, the logical network configuration and the wavelength allocations of each network-node equipment are described in the case where the network-node equipment 1-707, which was accommodated in the ring-shaped logical network topology into which the network-node equipment 714 was inserted, is newly transferred and established in the star-shaped logical network topology that attributes to the network-node equipment 1-710, and the logical topology is reconfigured. In this case, whereas before transferring, the network-node equipment 1-707 used wavelength \u03bb12 and \u03bb14 to communicate with the network-node equipment 1-706 and the network-node equipment 1-708 respectively, the wavelength of optical signals of the network-node equipment 1-707 is set to \u03bb16, and communication may be made to be performed between the network-node equipment 1-707 and the network-node equipment 1-710 using this wavelength \u03bb16. Also, before transferring, the wavelength \u03bb12 was used for communication between the network-node equipment 1-706 and the network-node equipment 1-707, and wavelength \u03bb14 was used for communication between the network-node equipment 1-707 and the network-node equipment 1-708. However, after transferring, the wavelengths of optical signals that are used at each of the network-node equipments 1-707, 1-708 and 1-709 may be changed so that the wavelength \u03bb13 is used for communication between the network-node equipment 1-706 and the network-node equipment 1-708.",
        "Thus, as with the above mentioned embodiment, by simply changing the wavelength allocations of the optical signals used for communication, the logical network topology can be dynamically changed. Here, although the wavelength allocation shown is for a case where the AWG disposed as the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101 disposed at the center in FIG. 18 is of a scale having 16\u00d716 as the number of optical input/output ports (N\u00d7N), of course this scale is not limited to 16\u00d716, and needs only to be greater than the capacity size of the network-node terminal.",
        "Next, a sixth embodiment according to the fiber optic communication system of the present invention is described, with reference to FIG. 1-19 and FIG. 20. In the present embodiment, an example of a network configuration that has wavelength allocations for forming a ring-shaped logical network topology, and that accommodates four network-node terminals 1-701 to 1-704 is described.",
        "FIG. 1-19 is a diagram showing the physical network topology of the sixth embodiment, and FIG. 1-20 is a diagram showing the logical network topology of the fiber optic communication system of the sixth embodiment and the wavelength allocations of the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101. In the present embodiment, a 4\u00d74 uniform-loss and cyclic-frequency (ULCF) AWG is used as the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101. Furthermore, in the wavelength allocations shown in FIG. 1-20, the network node equipments and the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) are shown physically connected via optical fibers so that unique numbers 1 to 4 assigned to network-node equipments match to port numbers of optical input/output ports of the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101. Moreover the wavelength allocation of optical signals at each of network-node terminals 1-701 to 1-704 has been set. This case corresponds to a case in which the number of network-node equipments is 4.",
        "In FIG. 1-19, each of the network-node equipments 1-701 to 1-704 has a WDM interface (hereunder referred to as WDM-IF) 1-700a that can change the wavelength of the optical signals, and two media access control units 1-700b and 700c (hereunder referred to as MAC), and the wavelengths of the optical signals for each MAC 1-700b and MAC 1-700c have been set so that one MAC 1-700b uses an optical signal of wavelength \u03bb2 to perform communication via the WDM interface 1-700a, and the other MAC 1-700c uses an optical signal of wavelength \u03bb4 to perform communication via the WDM interface 1-700a. Moreover, each of the MAC1-700b and 1-700c is provided with a function of transmitting back a received signal.",
        "Also, since the wavelength allocations of the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101 are set as shown in FIG. 1-20, two-way communication is performed between the network-node equipment 1-701 and the network-node equipment 1-702 using an optical signal of wavelength \u03bb2, two-way communication is performed between the network-node equipment 1-702 and the network-node equipment 1-703 using an optical signal of wavelength \u03bb4, two-way communication is performed between the network-node equipment 1-703 and the network-node equipment 1-704 using an optical signal of wavelength \u03bb2, and two-way communication is performed between the network-node equipment 1-704 and the network-node equipment 1-701 using an optical signal of wavelength \u03bb4. As a result, outside communication Outer-TX and Outer-RX, and inside communication Inner-TX and Inner-RX at each of the MAC 1-700b and the MAC 1-700c are performed, and a ring-shaped logical network topology is formed.",
        "The signals circuit around all the network-node equipments 1-701 to 1-704 according to the wavelength allocations shown in the diagram, however the present embodiment is characterized in that optical signals can be transmitted in both directions. Here, although the wavelengths of both directions are set to use the same wavelength, different wave allocations does not essentially create any difference. Also, although the wavelength allocation shown here is for a case where the AWG disposed as the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101 disposed at the center is of a 4\u00d74 scale, of course this scale is not limited to 4\u00d74, and needs only to be greater than the capacity size of the network-node equipment.",
        "The recovery method for the network, in the case where in this configuration as shown in FIG. 1-21, the optical fiber that physically connects the network-node equipment 1-701 and the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101 is cut, is described below.",
        "In this case, as the logical network topology in FIG. 1-22 shows, by respectively turning back the communication that has been performed between the network-node equipment 1701 and the network-node equipment 1-702, and between the network-node equipment 1-701 and the network-node equipment 1-704 at each of the network-node equipments 1-702 and 1-704 after the optical fiber connecting the network-node equipment 1-701 and the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) has been cut, an optical fiber disconnection failure can be bypassed. Specifically, when the optical fiber that physically connects the network-node equipment 1-701 and the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) 1-101 is disconnected, the communication in the network-node equipments 1-702 to 1-704 can be maintained by turning back and transmitting the signal received from the network-node equipment 1-703 to the network-node equipment 1-703 by the MAC 1-700c of the network-node equipment 1-702, and turning back and transmitting the signal received from the network-node equipment 1-703 to the network-node equipment 1-703 by the MAC 1-700b of the network-node equipment 1-704.",
        "The case in which the failure occurs at the network-node equipment 1-701 itself as shown in FIG. 1-23 is also the same. Moreover, when failures occur such as those mentioned above, detecting this and turning back signals automatically can be easily done, and by automatically turning back signals in this way, the recovery of a network in which a failure has occurred can be performed quickly and stably.",
        "With the above-mentioned ring-shaped logical network topology, in the method of recovering a network when a failure occurs due to optical fiber disconnection or breakdown of the network-node equipment, a new ring-shaped logical network topology can be reconfigured in the present fiber optic communication system to bypass the network-node equipment experiencing the failure. However, when there are more than 5 network node equipments there are a plurality of bypass routes when a failure occurs, and it is possible to construct a network that is very resilient to failures even when the number of network node equipments increases. An embodiment in which the number of network-node equipments is five is described here.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1-23.1, in the optical signal route and wavelength allocations, in a ring-shaped logical network topology configured so that five network-node, equipments 1-701 to 1-705 are connected via optical fibers to a 5\u00d75 arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) having respectively five optical input/output ports, when the optical fiber connected to the network-node equipment 5 (1-705) is disconnected, the network-node equipment 1 (1-701) bypasses the network-node equipment 5 (1-705) experiencing the failure and configures a new route for optical signals on the network-node equipment 4 (1-704). Hence it becomes possible to configure a ring-shaped logical network topology of, \u201cnetwork-node equipment 1 (1-701)\u2192network-node equipment 2 (1-702)\u2192network-node equipment 3 (1-703)\u2192network-node equipment 4 (1-704)\u2192network-node equipment 1 (1-701)\u201d. FIG. 1-23.2 shows the route and the wavelength allocations of the optical signals at this time. On the other hand, since the network-node equipment 1 is able to configure a route between other network-node equipments and itself by changing the wavelengths of optical signals, and since other network-node equipments are also able to configure arbitrary routes in the same way, the ring-shaped logical network topology that can be reconfigured is not limited to the alternate route that bypasses the network-node experiencing the failure, and a ring-shaped logical network topology that has a geometrical ring shaped route can be reconfigured. FIG. 1-23.3 shows a ring-shaped logical network topology configured with the route of optical signals, \u201cnetwork-node equipment 1 (1-701)\u2192network-node equipment 3 (1-703)\u2192network-node equipment 4 (1-704)\u2192network-node equipment 2 (1-702)\u2192network-node equipment 1 (1-701)\u201d, and the wavelength allocations at this time. In this way, since a plurality of bypassing routes exist in the ring-shaped logical network topology even when the number of network-node equipments has increased, the recovery of the network at the time of failure can be performed quickly and stably.",

Accordingly, it is necessary to perform processing for determining whether to accept or reject topology reconfiguration in the other network-node 4-2501, 2503 and 2504. In the case where an \u201cadvance notification of topology reconfiguration message\u201d M2 is received, the reception content is determined in step S35n, and subsequently it is determined whether topology reconfiguration is approved by the other network-node 4-2501, 2503 and 2504. In the case of approval, the network-node equipment status bits are changed to \u201c010\u201d in step S38n, the bits are transmitted to the central management equipment 4-301 in step S39n, and subsequently a signal is awaited from the central management equipment 4-301. When a new signal is received during this wait, and the signal is determined in step S35n to be a wavelength change information and change time class from the central management equipment 4-301, the network-node equipment control unit 1102 validates its status bits in step S43n, and in the case of \u201cyes\u201d, the network-node equipment status bits are changed to \u201c100\u201d in step S44n, the status bits are transmitted to the central management equipment 4-301 in step S45n, and control proceeds to step S46n for wavelength change. Conversely, in the case where it is determined that topology reconfiguration is rejected by the other network-node equipments 4-2501, 2503 and 2504 in step S37n, the status bits are changed to \u201c100\u201d in step S40n, the status bits are transmitted to the central management equipment 4-301 in step S41n, and also transmitted to the network node that requested topology reconfiguration.",
        "Afterwards control proceeds to step S46n, and the series of processing of steps S48n through S55n as shown in FIG. 4-32 is performed in the network-node equipment control unit 4-1102. That is, in steps S48n through S55n, the network-node equipment control unit 4-1102 performs a wavelength tunable light source output stop process, a wavelength data reading process, a wavelength tunable light source wavelength changing process, a wavelength tunable filter wavelength changing process, a wavelength tunable light source output start process, a status monitoring process, a status bit changing process, and a status bit transmission process. However, since the status of the network-node equipment is controlled by bits, differently from the case of the thirty-fifth embodiment, when wavelength change is completed, and a wavelength path is formed, the status bits are changed to \u201c101\u201d in step S54n, and subsequently, the bits are transmitted to the central management equipment 4-301 in step S55n.",

Six statuses are expressed by the status bits 4-12001 using three bits, and topology reconfiguration contention control at the time of a topology reconfiguration request from any network-node equipment 4-2501 through 2504 is performed using the status bits 4-12001. In the present embodiment, when the status bits 4-12001 are \u201c000\u201d, the network-node equipment status 4-12002 is \u201cinitial status\u201d, and when the status bits 4-12001 are \u201c001\u201d, \u201c010\u201d, \u201c011\u201d, \u201c100\u201d and \u201c101\u201d, the network-node equipment status 4-12002 is \u201ctopology reconfiguration reserved status\u201d, \u201ccompletion of acceptance of topology reconfiguration request from other network-node equipment status\u201d, \u201crejection of topology reconfiguration request from other network-node equipment status\u201d, \u201ccompletion of reception of wavelength and change clock-time class status\u201d, and \u201ccompletion of change to new wavelength status\u201d, respectively.",
