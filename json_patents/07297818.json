        "The P2X7 receptor (previously known as P2Z receptor), which is a ligand-gated ion channel, is present on a variety of cell types, largely those known to be involved in the inflammatory/immune process, specifically, macrophages, mast cells and lymphocytes (T and B). Activation of the P2X7 receptor by extracellular nucleotides, in particular adenosine triphosphate, leads to the release of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and giant cell formation (macrophages/microglial cells), degranulation (mast cells) and L-selectin shedding (lymphocytes). P2X7 receptors are also located on antigen-presenting cells (APC), keratinocytes, salivary acinar cells (parotid cells), hepatocytes, erythrocytes, erythroleukaemic cells, monocytes, fibroblasts, bone marrow cells, neurones and renal mesangial cells.",

Consequently, when the receptor is activated using bbATP in the presence of ethidium bromide (a fluorescent DNA probe), an increase in the fluorescence of intercellular DNA-bound ethidium bromide is observed. The increase in fluorescence can be used as a measure of P2X7 receptor activation and therefore to quantify the effect of a compound on the P2X7 receptor.",
        "In this manner, each of the title compounds of the Examples was tested for antagonist activity at the P2X7 receptor. Thus, the test was performed in 96-well flat bottomed microtitre plates, the wells being filled with 250 \u03bcl of test solution comprising 200 \u03bcl of a suspension of THP-1 cells (2.5\u00d7106 cells/ml) containing 10\u22124 M ethidium bromide, 25 \u03bcl of a high potassium buffer solution containing 10\u22125 M bbATP, and 25 \u03bcl of the high potassium buffer solution containing 3\u00d710\u22125 M test compound. The plate was covered with a plastics sheet and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for one hour. The plate was then read in a Perkin-Elmer fluorescent plate reader, excitation 520 nm, emission 595 nm, slit widths: Ex 15 nm, Em 20 nm. For the purposes of comparison, bbATP (a P2X7 receptor agonist) and pyridoxal 5-phosphate (a P2X7 receptor antagonist) were used separately in the test as controls. From the readings obtained, a pIC50 figure was calculated for each test compound, this figure being the negative logarithm of the concentration of test compound necessary to reduce the bbATP agonist activity by 50%. Each of the compounds of the Examples demonstrated antagonist activity, having a pIC50 figure>5.0."
