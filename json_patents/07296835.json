        "1. Field of Invention",
        "The present invention relates generally to a robotic or artificial arm and more particularly a robotic hand and fingers, lightweight and dexterous, having human like manipulation.",
        "2. Background Art",
        "Robotic arms, hands and fingers have been in use and disclosed by others with the usual mechanics using metal, bearings, cables, and pulleys. The use of robotic hands in various applications is apparent today. The need for robotic arms and hands has been prevalent in areas such as prosthetics, space exploration or other work environments where a human hand is not possible or desired. In many work environments, or for the sheer realism, human like manipulation is needed for conducting tasks which require precision, for instance in grasping objects with the necessary strength and at the same having sufficient control and dexterity.",
        "Most robotic hands have a plurality of digits, the little, ring, middle, index and thumb. Each finger is segmented into phalanges, where the tip is the distal phalange, followed by the middle (or medial) phalange, the proximal phalange and then the metacarpal at the knuckle. In constructing robotic hands with the detail, functionality and realism of human hands, the assembly can be highly complex and difficult to maintain. Servicing in turn is both difficult and often. In addition, certain assemblies result in a bulky design and also become too costly in both parts, manufacturing and as mentioned servicing.",
        "Many robot hands have been disclosed as driven with pneumatics or electric motors. Other robot hands similar to such mechanisms are being developed by such entities as Utah/MIT, Stanford/JPL, Okada, Barrett, Bologna University, DLR German Aerospace Center, LMS, DIST Genova, Robonaut NASA, Tokyo and Karlsruhe University, Ultralight research center of Karlsruhe, Gifu University Japan. Others have incorporated tactile capacitive sensing, such as Pressure Profile Systems Inc. onto robot hands. However, none of these attempts have addressed or solved the issues of providing a robot hand and arm of a compact, inexpensive, light weight product having sufficient power and necessary control.",
        "Prior attempts discussed above have the disadvantages and problems associated with fingers being too complex and difficult to build. In addition, power and dexterity is insufficient and cost for manufacturing such devices is much too high. Forearms have been designed but are too bulky and large to work on a robot. Simplicity in the mechanism for the movement in the fingers of the robot hand is missing. In addition, the use of sliding friction leads to cable going slack and other associated problems such as jerky motions.",
        "Therefore, there is a need for a solution to such problems such that a robot arm is both efficient and easier to manufacture, having sufficient power and dexterity in movement in various directions and at the same time provide for realistic and humanly realistic movement. It is accordingly a principal object of the invention to provide for robot hand with the power, speed, dexterity, control and feedback of a human hand at a minimal cost.",
        "An embodiment of the present invention is a robotic arm and in particular a robotic hand using no sliding friction except through a cable housing, but instead operates with rolling friction using cables. The preferred embodiment of the present invention provides for the robotic hand wherein the drum drive, cable housings, rolling friction, one pulley, ligament distal phalange, are designed to work together.",
        "One object of the present invention is to provide for a low cost and easily assemble robotic hand, for instance the preferred embodiment provides for only four manufactured parts for each finger of the robot hand. In the preferred embodiment, each finger employs one pulley, three pins, eight bearings and seven cables.",
        "Another object of the present invention is to provide for a cable housing that is compressible allowing for compliance at the finger tips and the cable housing prevents the fingers from moving as the wrist moves",
        "Yet another object of the present invention is to provide for removable fingers for servicing and providing bearings on the outside of the knuckle that allow the cables to pass through the center of the finger.",
        "In addition, the preferred embodiment has no screw thread and no fasteners. An entire finger can be snapped together in the preferred embodiment of the present invention.",
        "Another object of the invention provides for limited parts and easy assemble; fingers for instance, only use one pulley; cables wrap around the pulleys eliminating the need for additional pulleys or tight bends; the thumb may use three pulleys for additional capabilities such as independent distal movement.",
        "Another object of the present invention allows for the use of larger and stronger cables for greater grip strength of the hand.",
        "Yet another object of the present invention allows for a greater life of the cables in that the rolling friction allows for gentle bends of the cables and requires no tools to repair.",
        "Another object is to provide for the use of a cable ligament between the distal and middle phalange, instead of a rod connection. The ligament bends through two different radii, which gives a bending ratio that is different between the middle and distal phalange.",
        "The present invention can be made entirely non metallic with Kevlar cables (or its equivalent), Torlon bearings (or its equivalent), and carbon pins.",
        "In addition, the palm section of the present invention is shaped for holding tools in three positions.",
        "Another object of the present invention provides for the robotic hand to be driven by a glove over a human hand, or a hand held device that an operator can select specific grasps.",
        "Furthermore, an object of the present invention provides for sensitivity in touch through the use of capacitive sensors for measuring fingertip pressure, allowing for feedback to human driven manipulation.",
        "In another object of the present invention, the robotic hand is realistic in movement and provides various human-like range of motions, for example, providing for an arc position of the hand and other grasping positions.",
        "These and other embodiments of the present invention are further made apparent, in the remainder of the present document, to those of ordinary skill in the art.",
        "In order to more fully describe embodiments of the present invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings. These drawings are not to be considered limitations in the scope of the invention, but are merely illustrative.",

FIG. 4, further illustrates palm section 15 and the connection to truncated shafts 32 of metacarpal 30, and defines openings for the respective cables to move through.",
        "FIG. 5 shows a top view of a digit such as index finger 4, illustrated in a bent or constricted position at the middle knuckle 52 according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 6 illustrates the cross-sectional side view of finger 4 along the positional line taken on FIG. 5. As discussed in FIG. 2, each phalange pivots about its respective shaft and knuckle. The plurality of shafts 70 are preferably comprised of steel but may be comprised of any similar or suitable material. A plurality of cables is provided throughout each digit, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 2. As illustrated in FIG. 6, cables 91, 92 are provided for movement of the middle phalange 50 and distal phalange 60. In essence, cables 91, 92 are a single continuous cable, in which cable 91 extends from distal phalange 60 around drum 20 located in arm 2 and wraps around pulley 80 as cable 92, to extend to the middle phalange 50, around the underside of the diameter of middle knuckle 52. For purposes of clarity cables 91, 92, are described as separate cables moving the phalanges in different directions. Cables 91, 92, powered by the rotational motor 22, moved by drum 20 and routed through proximal knuckle 42 over pulley 80, controls movement of the distal and middle phalanges of the finger using rolling friction for control. The cables do not slide across any surface except the cable housing 25. Pulley 80 may comprise of a plastic or metal or other suitable material. In a preferred embodiment, fingers 4, 6, 8, and 10 each comprise seven cables; and thumb 12 comprise eight cables. Having seven cables per finger and eight cables for the thumb, allows for sixteen degrees of freedom in the hand.",
        "FIG. 6 illustrates how cable 91 is pulled around drum 20, and about the topside of the pulley 80 and about the topside of the diameter of middle knuckle 52. When engaged, cable 91 pulls the middle phalange 50 and distal phalange 60 in the upward direction (as shown by the dotted image) through rolling friction. Cable 92 is wrapped around pulley 80, crossing on the underside of pulley 80, and extending around the diameter of middle knuckle 52; a reversal of the pull causes middle phalange 50 to move in the downward direction. At both points of contact with the pulley and middle knuckle 52, cable 92 moves middle phalange 50 with rolling friction. Cable 92 pulls middle phalange 50 in the downward direction, by wrapping about pulley 80, which prevents rubbing on the metacarpal 30 when moved in the down position. Cables 91, 92 and all of the plurality of cables used throughout the hand 1 wrapped around or about a pulley such that no sliding friction occurs, and the movement uses rolling friction.",
        "FIG. 7 shows a top view of a digit such as index finger 4, illustrated in a bent or constricted position at the middle knuckle 52, according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 8 illustrates the cross-sectional side view of finger 4 along the positional line taken on FIG. 7. FIG. 8 demonstrates the location of cable 93 extending from the proximal phalange 40, over the diameter of middle knuckle 52 and underneath the diameter of distal knuckle 62. Cable 93 is the ligament cable, which when engaged, pulls distal phalange 60 in a downward direction using rolling friction. When cable 92 as shown in FIG. 6, pulls down the middle phalange 50, cable 93 pulls distal phalange 60 downward as a function of the diameters of the middle knuckle 52 and the distal knuckle 62. The ligament bends through two different radii, which gives a bending ratio that is different between the middle phalange 50 and the distal phalange 60. For instance, the middle phalange 50 may bend 90 degrees and the distal phalange 60 will only bend 60 degrees similar to a real finger. In the preferred embodiment, the cables have a large bend radii of no smaller than approximately half the diameter of the finger. Such a large bend radii allows the use of larger and stronger cables for greater grip strength. In addition, there is no backward bends of the cables which ensures for greater life of the cables.",
        "According to an embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 9 shows a top view of a digit such as an index finger 4, illustrated in a bent or constricted position at the proximal knuckle 42. FIG. 10 illustrates the cross-sectional side view of finger 4 along the positional line taken on FIG. 9. The finger 4 is shown bent down at the proximal knuckle between the metacarpal 30 and proximal 40 phalanges. Drum 20 and rotational motor 22 drive cables 94, 95 that pass through the palm 15 and rotate finger 4 downward at the proximal knuckle 42. Cable 94 is wrapped about the top side of the diameter of the proximal knuckle 42, and using rolling friction to control proximal phalange 40 pulls proximal phalange 40 in the upward direction. Cable 95 is wrapped about the underside of the diameter of the proximal knuckle 42, and using rolling friction to control proximal phalange 40 pulls proximal phalange 40 in the downward direction.",
        "As shown in FIG. 11 cable 96 is connected to one side of metacarpal phalange 30 of finger 4, wrapped about drum 20, and extended to the opposing side of metacarpal phalange 30, as cable 97. Through the rotation of drum 10 by rotational motor 22 a range of sideways movement for the entire finger assembly 4 is achieved by the push or pull cables 96 and 97. As cable 96 is pulled in a clockwise direction, finger 4 moves accordingly. As cable 97 is pulled in a counter clockwise direction, finger 4 moves accordingly.",

FIG. 12 illustrates the capacitor plates 100 located on the distal phalange 125 but can be applied anywhere on the digit for measuring pressure. In FIG. 12, the pressure sensors 100 measure the capacitance between a painted metallic surface on the phalange 125 and a metallic foil lined outer layer on the phalange. In another embodiment of the present invention, the pressure sensors 100 measure the capacity between a painted metallic surface on the phalanges and a metallic foil lined glove (not shown). An embodiment of the present invention further comprises a plurality of coaxial cables which prevent cross talk and having a voltage that is non-linear due to a set of bumps or friction material (not shown) located on the outside of the phalanges and the compressive nature of the closed cell foam in the glove. The frictional material also reduces slippage between the finger and the glove.",
        "As described, the capacitive pressure sensors or capacitor plates 100 on the finger tips such as distal phalange 125, provide a non-linear voltage such that when a finger contacts an object 108, there is a sensitive range for delicate work and a coarse range for gripping large objects. As shown in FIG. 13, distal phalange 125 makes contact with a hard object 108. In the preferred embodiment, this is accomplished through the use of a specific thickness of closed cell foam in the glove and carefully designed bumps on the finger tips. The bumps allow for gripping on the glove and controlling the capacitive sensor response. A grounded metal foil lined glove being one side of the capacitive sensor, and the other side being metal painted phalanges with attached wires, makes the assembly more robust than individual sensors. As shown in FIGS. 12, 13, the attached capacitor's electrical wire 104 or wires, run through wire routing guides inside the finger assembly and is connected to the capacitor plate 100.",
        "As discussed, in the preferred embodiment, there is only one pulley 80 per digit 4, 6, 8, 10. The pulley and cable combination gives a torque multiplication at the metacarpal 30 joint increasing the grip strength of the hand 1. A cable (such as cable 91) that runs from the distal phalange 60 to the middle phalange 50 reduces the need for two extra cables per digit.",

        "The embodiments of the present inventions exhibit a simplified structure to other attempts in providing for a lightweight, controlled, dexterous, efficient, easy to manufacture, and powerful robot hands and arms. The embodiments of the present invention incorporate the use of rolling friction in joints of the fingers, allowing a cable to roll across the joint instead of slide across, thus diminishing friction. Since the cables wrap around the pulleys instead of over, the need for additional pulleys or tights bends is eliminated. The preferred embodiment incorporates maintaining a constant cable length to prevent the cable from going slack. Each of the fingers within a hand is removable and comprises truncated shafts 32 molded or pressed into the metacarpal phalanges to retain the side bearings 79 for ease of maintenance. Such structural connection allows room for the cables to enter a palm section of the hand without a shaft obstructing the way. The fingers and each phalange are preferably manufactured from a molding process or other equivalent process used in the industry. The material used can be plastics, metals or polymers such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) or other similar materials.",
        "In the present embodiment, the bearings are also retained, but since the force on the bearings is always in the same direction, the bearings are able to snap into the palm section and the cable tension keeps the fingers in place. When the cable tension is eased, or the cables removed, the finger is removed for maintenance or replacement. Such structure allows the fingers to be built or repaired separately and then installed on the palm. In addition, after loosening one end of each cable, no screw threads or fasteners are required and repair can be accomplished without the use of tools. The cable housing was carefully selected to provide the correct amount of spring force without collapsing under the force of the cable. The compliance of the housing allows the fingers to pick up delicate objects without breaking them. The cable housing is made from an extension spring and a compression spring (or equivalent compliant materials) in series with a PTFE (Teflon) liner to minimize friction on the cables.",
