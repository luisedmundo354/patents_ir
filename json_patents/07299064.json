        "Cellular wireless systems support wireless communication services in many populated areas of the world. While cellular wireless systems were initially constructed to service voice communications, they are now called upon to support data communications as well. The demand for data communication services has exploded with the acceptance and widespread use of the Internet. While data communications have historically been serviced via wired connections, wireless users are now demanding that their wireless units also support data communications. Many wireless subscribers now expect to be able to \u201csurf\u201d the Internet, access their email, and perform other data communication activities using their cellular phones, wireless personal data assistants, wirelessly linked notebook computers, and/or other wireless devices. The demand for wireless system data communications will only increase with time. Thus, wireless systems are currently being created/modified to service these burgeoning data communication demands.",
        "Significant performance issues exist when using a wireless system to service data communications. Wireless systems were initially designed to service the well-defined requirements of voice communications. Generally speaking, voice communications require a sustained bandwidth over a period of several minutes. Data communications, on the other hand, have very different performance requirements. Data communications are typically bursty, discontinuous, and may require a relatively high bandwidth during data transfer, which may be very short (on the order of a few seconds). To understand the difficulties in servicing data communications within a wireless system, consider the structure and operation of a cellular wireless system.",
        "Cellular wireless systems include a \u201cnetwork infrastructure\u201d that wirelessly communicates with wireless subscriber units within a respective service coverage area. The network infrastructure typically includes a plurality of base stations dispersed throughout the service coverage area, each of which supports wireless communications within a respective cell (or set of sectors). The base stations couple to base station controllers (BSCs), with each BSC serving a plurality of base stations. Each BSC couples to a mobile switching center (MSC). Each BSC also typically directly or indirectly couples to the Internet.",
        "In operation, a wireless subscriber unit communicates with one (or more) of the base stations. A BSC coupled to the serving base station routes voice communications between the MSC and the serving base station. The MSC routes the voice communication to another MSC or to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). BSCs route data communications between a servicing base station and a packet data network that may couple to the Internet.",
        "The wireless link between the base station and the wireless subscriber unit is defined by one of a plurality of operating technologies and standards, e.g., AMPS, TDMA, CDMA, GSM, etc. These operating standards, as well as new 3G and 4G operating standards, define the manner in which the wireless link may be allocated, setup, serviced and torn down. These operating standards must set forth operations that will be satisfactory in servicing both voice and data communications. Each of these next generation systems will be called upon to support high-speed data communications.",
        "In currently deployed digital cellular networks, e.g., 1xRTT networks, both voice and data communications are supported via wireless digital communications. Depending upon particular service provider criteria, base station resources within a cell/sector are divided between voice and data users. In most systems, the service provider desires to limit call blocking for voice users. To accomplish this goal, the number of Walsh codes and the amount of transmit power that may be allocated to data users is limited. 1xRTT systems support two types of forward links for data service, Fundamental Channels (FCHs) and Supplemental Channels (SCHs). FCHs provide the basic data service to data users. SCHs are bursty higher bandwidth channels that are rapidly allocated and deallocated as cell/sector conditions permit. A data user is \u201cblocked\u201d when it cannot be allocated a FCH, i.e., when sufficient data user resources are unavailable for such an allocation.",
        "In order to address this undesirable operation, in 1xRTT systems, each base station is controlled to reserve a certain percentage of available data user resources for FCHs. One technique involves reserving a percentage of available forward link transmit power in a base station for FCHs. Another technique involves reserving Walsh codes for FCH allocation. However, neither of these techniques considers cell/sector loading and the unique needs of wireless subscriber units operating in such a cell/sector.",
        "A need therefore exists for allocation of available data user cell/sector resources among data users to increase throughput but to minimize data user blocking.",
        "Thus, to overcome the shortcomings of the prior operations, among other shortcomings, a method for servicing data communications in a cell/sector of a digital cellular wireless system dynamically allocates available data user forward transmit power within a cell/sector. This method may be performed in an effort to maximize cell/sector data throughput and to meet a desired level of data user call blocking. The method includes first allocating data user forward link transmit power within the cell/sector, wherein the data user forward link transmit power is the total forward link transmit power that may be allocated to data users within the cell/sector. The method then includes setting a data user Fundamental Channel (FCH) forward link transmit power reserve level upper limit (fd,max) that is a maximum portion of the data user forward link transmit power that may be reserved for allocation to data users on FCHs within the cell/sector. Next, the method includes initializing a data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level (fd) to a value that is less than or equal to the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level upper limit.",
        "The base station is then operated to allocate FCHs to data users within the cell/sector, deallocate FCHs to data users within the cell/sector, allocate SCHs to data users within the cell/sector, and to deallocate SCHs to data users within the cell/sector. In these operations, SCHs are allocated so that the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level is maintained. Further, based upon at least one current data user operating condition in the cell/sector, the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level fd is adjusted. In making these adjustments, the method prevents the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level fd from exceeding the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level upper limit.",
        "The method may also include setting a data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level lower limit (fd,min) that is a minimum portion of the data user forward link transmit power that may be reserved for allocation to data users on FCHs within the cell/sector. When this further limitation is included, the method includes preventing the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level from being less than the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level lower limit. In any of the embodiments of the present invention, one or more versions of the 1xRTT communication standard may be supported.",
        "With the method of the present invention, in adjusting the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level fd based upon at least one current operating condition in the cell/sector, the method may be accomplished according to a number of embodiments. In a first embodiment of this operation, when a data call is admitted successfully, the method includes decreasing the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level fd by a first step size. Further, with this first embodiment, when a data call is blocked, the method includes increasing the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level fd by a second step size. In this first embodiment, the first step size may be proportional to a desired probability of data call blocking. Further, the second step size may be selected to meet a desired maximum rate at which the FCH forward link transmit power reserve level is allowed to increase. In a second embodiment of this operation, adjusting the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level includes adjusting the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level fd to a level that exceeds a current usage level of data user FCH forward link transmit power by a configurable proportionality factor. This second embodiment will minimize data user FCH blocking until the limit fd,max is reached.",
        "According to a third embodiment of the present invention when a FCH allocation request is received, calculations are performed to determine the average FCH transmit power currently in use, i.e., total active FCH transmit power divided by the number of active FCH users. Then, a determination is made as to whether the requested FCH allocation, if made, would cause the FCH forward link transmit power to exceed fd. If so, it is next determined whether fd can be increased and, if it can, fd is increased by a first amount. If not, it is next determined whether fd can be increased and, if it can, fd is increased by a second amount. The third embodiment may be performed such that fd is increased by a lesser amount when the FCH can be allocated than when it cannot be allocated. Alternately, the third embodiment may be performed such that fd is increased by a greater amount when the FCH can be allocated than when it cannot be allocated.",

As illustrated, wireless subscriber units may include cellular telephones 116 and 118, laptop computers 126 and 134, desktop computers 128 and 136, and data terminals 130 and 132. However, the wireless system supports communications with other types of wireless subscriber units as well.",

The cellular wireless system supports both voice and data traffic. However, operations according to the present invention relate to the service of high-rate data communications. As is generally known, devices such as laptop computers 126 and 134, desktop computers 128 and 136, data terminals 130 and 132, and cellular telephones 116 and 118, are enabled to \u201csurf\u201d the Internet 114, transmit and receive data communications such as email, transmit and receive files, and to perform other data operations. Many of these data operations have significant download data-rate requirements while the upload data-rate requirements are not as severe.",
        "A user of a particular wireless subscriber unit may subscribe to a service that requires relatively high bandwidth. In order to service these high-speed data communication requirements, in particular the larger download data-rate requirements, the IS-95B, and 1xRTT standards contemplate multiple download channels, i.e., fundamental traffic channels (FCHs) and supplemental traffic channels (SCHs). The SCH is a channel that is allocated to a particular wireless subscriber unit to augment the FCH. In some standards, the SCH provides variable rate data service, e.g., 19.2 kbps, 38.4 kbps, 76.8 kbps, 153.6 kbps, and 307.2 kbps, among other data rates.",
        "The data rate that can be provided via a particular SCH is based upon the signal quality as seen by a serviced wireless subscriber unit. The signal quality will depend upon the distance of the wireless subscriber unit from its servicing base station, the maximum transmit power that the servicing base station can provide for the channel, the propagation path characteristics from the base station to the wireless subscriber unit, and the noise present at the wireless subscriber unit, among other factors. Thus, if the signal quality that may be provided is high, the SCH will support a relatively higher data rate by using a relatively higher symbol rate. If the signal quality that may be provided is low, the SCH will support a relatively lower data rate by using a lower symbol rate.",
        "Various techniques have been developed to manage FCHs and SCHs in such a cellular wireless system 100. One such technique is included in the operations referred to as the Radio Resource Management (RRM) operations. Using the RRM operations, considering the signal quality available as well as a number of other considerations, a supportable data rate for the SCH is determined. Considerations in determining the supportable data rate include the available transmit power, system-wide interference levels, resources available in the BSC and the base station, and other considerations. The supportable data rate for the given channel is expected to yield a particular Frame Error Rate (FER) for serviced physical layer data frames, e.g., 1%, 5%, etc. In a conventional system, the supportable data rate is used for the SCH and provides data throughput at the supportable data rate with the expected FER.",
        "Thus, for example, if data terminal 132 is downloading a large data file, receiving streaming audio, or watching an audiovisual presentation, for example, base station 105 will service its wireless data communications. Both the FCH and one or more SCHs are employed to service this wireless data communication for the data terminal 132. Using conventional techniques, the RRM operations would yield a supportable data rate to use for the SCH servicing the data communications. At this supportable data rate for the SCH, an expected FER would result, e.g., 1%, 5%, etc. The BSC 152 and the base station 105 would work in cooperation to service these data communications at the supportable data rate. However, if a SCH is being serviced and another data user requests access to the cellular wireless system 100, it may not be able to service the data user request and the data user will be blocked.",
        "The RRM allows the operator of the cellular wireless system 100 to specify a maximum power usage for both voice and data. These limits are referred to as Tv and Td, respectively. The RRM also allows the operator to specify a fraction of the forward link data user transmit power that is reserved for data user FCH use. This fraction is denoted fd. Reservation of some power for FCHs decreases the probability that a single data user can prevent the admission of other data users during a high-power SCH burst. However reserving power for FCHs decreases the probability of blocking at the expense of a decrease in the pool of power available for SCHs, and therefore at the expense of the peak data rate available to data users. Simulation work performed by the inventors of the present invention indicates that the value of fd that yields 1% data call blocking varies considerably, from a low of 10%, to a high in excess of 40%, depending upon the mixture of voice users and data users in a particular cell/sector. Generally, as a serviced cell/sector changes from being dominated by voice traffic to being dominated by data traffic, the RF loading that gives the highest throughput decreases from 70% (for nearly all voice) to 50% (for nearly all data). Table 1 provides relevant information for this study, including the fraction of reserved data FCH power, fd. Based upon this study, it has been concluded that it is difficult for operators to properly choose fd, since a value that achieves low blocking and high throughput under one set of conditions (or at one time of the day), may be a poor choice in different conditions, or at a different time.",

        "Thus, according to the present invention, a method of automatically adjusting the power reserved for data FCHs is presented. The algorithm slowly adjusts the fd value in each sector independently so that the FCH reserved power is as small as possible while still keeping the blocking low (below some target value). This has the effect of maximizing per-user throughput, which is a critical component of subscriber grade of service. In prior systems, fd is a single data-filled value, distributed to all base stations (BTSs). According to the present invention, this single value is replaced with a maximum and a minimum value, fd,max and fd,min, and an algorithm to control a time-dependent value of fd between these extremes is enacted. The automatic adaptation of fd can be disabled by reverting to the fixed value that is currently used. Also, the adaptive algorithm can be set conservatively, by setting fd,max and fd,min close to each other, and close to the fixed value of fd recommended previously.",
        "According to the present invention, the time-variant fd is initialized to fd,max or fd,min, or somewhere in between, as desired. To adapt the value of fd between the limits, there are a number of possibilities. In each case, if the algorithm causes the value of fd to fall above fd,max or below fd,min, the algorithm caps the dynamic value.",
        "According to a first embodiment of the present invention, a method similar to that used by outer loop power control is employed to keep the FCH blocking rate at a certain percentage. Each time that a data call is admitted successfully, fd is decreased by some quantity PB\u00b7\u0394, where PB is the desired probability of blocking, and \u0394 is some step size. When a data call is blocked, fd is increased by \u0394. These operations keep the long-term value of fd at the lowest level that can maintain the desired blocking probability.",
        "According to a second embodiment of the present invention, fd is adjusted based upon a measure of the current fraction of available data power used by FCHs. For example, if the measured fraction of available data power used by FCHs is fd,meas, then set fd=A*fd,meas, where A is some multiple (greater than one) that ensures extra power for the admission of new FCHs. This operation essentially keeps the blocking probability at zero while the dynamic value of fd is between its upper and lower limits.",
        "FIG. 2 is a logic diagram illustrating operation according to the present invention. Operation commences with first allocating a base station's data user forward link transmit power within the cell/sector, wherein the data user forward link transmit power is the total forward link transmit power that may be allocated to data users within the cell/sector (step 202). The method then includes setting a data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level upper limit fd,max that is a maximum portion of the data user forward link transmit power that may be reserved for allocation to data users on FCHs within the cell/sector (step 204). The method then optionally includes setting a data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level lower limit fd,min (step 206). fd,min is a minimum portion of the data user forward link transmit power that may be reserved for allocation to data users on FCHs within the cell/sector. Next, the method includes setting an initial data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level fd to a value that is less than or equal to the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level upper limit and, if a data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level lower limit is implemented, greater than or equal to the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level lower limit (step 208).",

In these operations, SCHs are allocated so that the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level is maintained. Further, based upon at least one current data user operating condition in the cell/sector, the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level fd is adjusted. In making these adjustments, the method prevents the data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level fd from violating fd,max and fd,min.",

If so, it is next determined whether fd can be increased, i.e., is it equal to fd,max (step 404). If fd cannot be increased, operation proceeds to step 210. If fd can be increased, it is increased by a step size that makes fd proportional to the new total FCH data power by a proportionality constant A (step 406). If in step 406 the resulting value of fd is larger than fd,max, the value of fd is set equal to fd,max, after which operation returns to step 210. If it was determined in step 402 that an FCH was not allocated, it is next determined whether a FCH was deallocated (step 408). If not, operation proceeds to step 210. If so, it is next determined whether fd can be decreased, i.e., is it equal to fd,min (step 410). If fd can be decreased it is decreased by a step size that makes fd proportional to the new total FCH data power by a proportionality constant A (step 412). If in step 412 the resulting value of fd is smaller than fd,min, the value of fd is set equal to fd,min.",
        "FIG. 5 is a graph illustrating the operation of a cell/sector in a cellular wireless system having a fixed data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level. With fd being fixed, a data user will be blocked from being allocated a FCH when the actual allocated FCH transmit power reaches fd. Not only will the data user be blocked, the data user may be blocked for no reason simply due to the setting of fd. That is, there may be excess power and Walsh codes available to serve the blocked user, resulting in an underutilization of resources.",
        "FIG. 6 is a graph illustrating the operation of a cell/sector in a cellular wireless system having a variable data user FCH forward link transmit power reserve level according to the present invention. With the operation of FIG. 6, fd is dynamically set between fd,min and fd,max based upon system conditions. With these operations, because fd is dynamically altered based upon system conditions, data user FCH blockage is minimized and data throughput for the cell/sector is maximized.",

        "FIG. 9 is a flow chart illustrating in detail a third embodiment of the operations of step 230 of the present invention. According to the third embodiment, after the allocation of a FCH, calculations are performed to determine the average FCH transmit power currently in use, i.e., total active FCH transmit power divided by the number of active FCH users (step 904). Then, a determination is made as to whether a FCH can be allocated, i.e., if the requested FCH allocation is made would cause the FCH forward link transmit power to exceed fd, e.g., is T+q<fd (step 906). If the requested FCH allocation cannot be made, it is next determined whether fd can be increased (step 908) and, if it can, fd is increased by a first amount (step 910). If fd cannot be increased, as determined at step 908, and from step 910, operation returns to step 210. If the requested FCH allocation can be made, it is next determined whether fd can be increased (step 912) and, if it can, fd is increased by a second amount (step 914) from both step 912 and step 914 operation proceeds to step 210 after the FCH allocation is made at step 916.
