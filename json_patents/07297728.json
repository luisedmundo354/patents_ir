        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to friction materials suitable for use in such applications as brake pads and brake linings for automobiles and various types of industrial machinery.",
        "2. Prior Art",
        "Friction materials such as disk brake pads and brake linings, particularly those used in vehicles such as automobiles and motorcycles, are required to have not only a sufficiently high coefficient of friction (good effectiveness), but also various other properties. For the intentions of the driver to be accurately manifested as a braking force on the vehicle, a quality referred to hereinafter as \u201cexcellent brake feel,\u201d it is essential that the friction material undergo little elastic deformation when subjected to stress and that the coefficient of friction have a linear relationship with the stress (i.e., that the strain incurred be linear). Further requirements include low fluctuation in the friction coefficient (a linear torque) even when the opposing material such as a disc rotor or brake drum is turning at high speed or is at a high temperature, little tendency to damage the disc rotor (low disc rotor attack), resistance of the friction material to wear, and little tendency for metal components from the abraded rotor to aggregate on the surface of the friction material and cause abnormal wear of the disc rotor (low metal pickup). The desire has been to achieve these and other required properties in a good balance.",
        "Of these various required properties, to ensure in particular a high friction coefficient under high loading, JP-A 8-135703 discloses a friction material for stainless steel rotors which is composed of a fibrous base, a resin binder and a filler, and which includes as metal components 30 to 60 wt % of at least one type of copper-based fiber selected from among copper fibers and brass fibers and 3 to 10 wt % of stainless steel fibers or powder, and additionally includes 2 to 10 wt % of graphite. All of these amounts are based on the overall friction material.",
        "Also, particularly to obtain a friction material having a linear torque (that is, to prevent a decrease in the coefficient of friction under the application of a high hydraulic pressure), JP-A 1-320329 discloses a friction material composition which is prepared by blending reinforcing fibrous materials, specifically 5 to 15% of steel fibers or stainless steel fibers, and also ceramic fibers and organic resin fibers, with organic fillers, inorganic fillers, metal powders and friction modifiers, and binding these components with a thermoset resin binder, and which additionally contains 0.1 to 2.0 vol % of an alloy powder having a microvickers hardness of at least 1,000.",
        "However, friction materials endowed with all of the various above properties required of friction materials for disc brake pads, particularly those used in vehicles such as automobiles, have not hitherto been developed. Hence, there is a need for friction materials which achieve a good balance of these required properties.",
        "It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a friction material in which the amount of strain with respect to the hydraulic line pressure is linear and which thus confers a excellent brake feel, in which the torque developed in response to the pushing force at high speed and at high temperature is linear, which has a good effectiveness, which minimizes disc rotor attack, disc pad wear and metal pickup, and moreover in which all of these properties exist in a good balance.",
        "The inventors have found that friction materials which are made by molding and curing a composition containing a fibrous base, a friction modifier and a binder, and in which the fibrous base includes stainless steel fibers but is free of other steel fibers and the friction modifier includes at least two types of hard particles having a Mohs hardness of at least 9, bronze powder and 3.5 to 7.5 wt % of tin sulfide, based on the overall composition, are able to achieve a good balance in the various properties required of friction materials for disc brake pads, particularly those used in automobiles and other vehicles.",
        "Accordingly, the invention provides a friction material made by molding and curing a composition containing a fibrous base, a friction modifier and a binder, wherein the fibrous base includes stainless steel fibers but is free of other steel fibers and the friction modifier includes at least two types of hard particles having a Mohs hardness of at least 9, bronze powder and 3.5 to 7.5 vol % of tin sulfide, based on the overall composition.",
        "The friction material is typically free of copper fibers and copper powder. The hard particles having a Mohs hardness of at least 9 preferably include silicon carbide and alumina.",
        "The friction material of the invention is made by molding and curing a composition containing a fibrous base, a friction modifier and a binder.",
        "Fibrous bases that may be used in the invention include metal fibers, inorganic fibers and organic fibers commonly used in friction materials. Illustrative examples of suitable fibrous bases include metal fibers such as stainless steel fiber and aluminum fiber; inorganic fibers such as ceramic fibers, potassium titanate fibers, glass fibers, rock wool, wollastonite, sepiolite, and synthetic mineral fibers; and organic fibers such as carbon fibers, aramid fibers, aramid pulp, polyimide fibers and polyamide especially preferred. Illustrative examples of such binders include phenolic resins, phenol aralkyl resins, various rubber-modified phenolic resins such as high-ortho phenolic resins modified with acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), NBR-modified phenolic resins, acrylic rubber-modified phenolic resins and aromatically modified phenolic resins, and also melamine resins, epoxy resins, NBR, nitrile rubber and acrylic rubber. Any one or combinations of two or more of these may be used.",

The friction modifier used in the invention has a shape or form which, while not subject to any particular limitation, is preferably spherical, granular or powdery. Friction modifier in other forms, such as those composed of football-shaped, tabular or irregular shaped particles, may also be used, so long as the objects of the invention are attainable.",
        "Illustrative examples of metal friction modifiers include metal powders such as iron, bronze, aluminum and stainless steel. These may be used singly or in combinations of two or more thereof. As noted above, the friction modifier in the invention includes a bronze powder. Moreover, in the invention, it is preferable to not use copper fibers or copper powder. Copper fibers and copper powder have a certain degree of hardness, which may result in an effectiveness that is excessive.",
        "The metal powder has an average particle size of generally at least 40 \u03bcm, and preferably at least 60 \u03bcm, but generally not more than 120 \u03bcm, and preferably not more than 100 \u03bcm. \u201cAverage particle size,\u201d as used herein, refers to the 50% mean particle diameter measured using a laser diffraction-type particle size distribution analyzer.",
        "The amount of metal friction modifier in the friction material composition, while not subject to any particular limitation, is generally at least 3.5 vol %, and preferably at least 4.5 vol %, but generally not more than 7.5 vol %, and preferably not more than 6.5 vol %, based on the overall composition.",
        "Illustrative examples of inorganic friction modifiers include calcium carbonate, barium sulfate, magnesium oxide, graphite, calcium hydroxide, zirconium silicate, iron oxide, mica, zirconium oxide, quartz, alumina, silicon carbide, vermiculite, slaked lime, coke, graphite, tin sulfide and molybdenum disulfide. These may be used singly or as combinations of two or more thereof. As noted above, the friction modifier in the invention includes at least two types of hard particles having a Mohs hardness of at least 9, and tin sulfide.",
        "Illustrative examples of the hard particles having a Mohs hardness of at least 9 include silicon carbide, alumina, titanium carbide, tungsten carbide, boron carbide, silicon nitride and boron nitride. Of these, the combined use of silicon carbide and alumina is preferred. When only silicon carbide is included, sufficiently low levels of disc rotor attack, disc pad wear and metal pickup may not be achieved. On the other hand, when only alumina is included, the torque fibers. These fibrous bases may be used singly or as combinations of two or more thereof. To achieve a friction material which undergoes an amount of strain that is linear with respect to the hydraulic line pressure and thus provides a excellent brake feel, and in which the torque developed in response to a pushing force at high speed and high temperature is linear, the friction material composition must include stainless steel fibers but be free of other steel fibers. Were the friction material to contain steel fibers but no stainless steel fibers, the linearity of the torque developed in response to the pushing force at high speed and high temperature would decrease.",
        "The shape of the stainless steel fibers is not subject to any particular limitation. Stainless steel fibers of any shape, including short fibers and long fibers, may be used, although the use of short stainless steel fibers is preferred.",
        "The stainless steel fibers have an average diameter of generally at least 24 \u03bcm, and preferably at least 40 \u03bcm, but generally not more than 75 \u03bcm, and preferably not more than 60 \u03bcm.",
        "The stainless steel fibers have a length of generally at least 0.5 mm, and preferably at least 0.7 mm, but generally not more than 1.5 mm, and preferably not more than 1.3 mm. The fiber diameter and length are each obtained as the average of 50 measurements under an optical microscope.",
        "No particular limitation is imposed on the amount of stainless steel fiber included in the friction material composition of the invention, although the amount based on the overall composition is generally at least 5 vol %, and preferably at least 7 vol %, but generally not more than 14 vol %, and preferably not more than 12 vol %. Too much stainless steel fiber may increase disc rotor attack, whereas too little may lower the linearity of friction material strain with respect to the hydraulic line pressure.",
        "The binder may be any known binder commonly used in friction materials, although a thermoset resin binder is developed in response to a pushing force at high speed and high temperature may have poor linearity so that good effectiveness is not achieved.",
        "The hard particles having a Mohs hardness of at least 9 are preferably in the form of a milled powder having sharp angles.",

If the silicon carbide has too large an average particle size, disc rotor attack may not be sufficiently low. On the other hand, if it has too small an average particle size, the torque linearity and effectiveness of the friction material may be compromised.",
        "The silicon carbide content, based on the overall friction material composition, is generally at least 1 vol %, and preferably at least 1.5 vol %, but generally not more than 3 vol %, and preferably not more than 2.5 vol %.",

        "As noted above, it is preferable for both silicon carbide and alumina to be used in the invention. When both are used together, their combined amount, based on the overall friction material composition, is generally at least 2.5 vol %, and preferably at least 3 vol %, but generally not more than 4.5 vol %, and preferably not more than 4 vol %. Too large a combined amount of silicon carbide and alumina may increase disc rotor attack, whereas too small a combined amount may compromise the effectiveness of the friction material.",
        "In the practice of the invention, the average particle size of the tin sulfide included in the friction modifier, while not subject to any particular limitation, is generally at least 5 \u03bcm, and preferably at least 7 \u03bcm, but generally not more than 30 \u03bcm, and preferably not more than 20 \u03bcm.",
        "The tin sulfide content, based on the overall friction material composition, is generally at least 3.5 vol %, and preferably at least 4.5 vol %, but generally not more than 7.5 vol %, and preferably not more than 6.5 vol %. Too much tin sulfide may compromise the effectiveness of the friction material, whereas too little may result in increased disc rotor attack, disc pad wear and metal pickup.",
        "To obtain a friction material having a low disc rotor attack and minimal disc pad wear, it is advantageous for the inorganic friction modifier in the invention to include graphite. When graphite is used, it has an average particle size of generally at least 150 \u03bcm, and preferably at least 200 \u03bcm, but generally not more than 350 \u03bcm, and preferably not more than 300 \u03bcm.",
        "The graphite content, while not subject to any particular limitation, is generally at least 7 vol %, and preferably at least 9 vol %, but generally not more than 15 vol %, and preferably not more than 13 vol %, based on the overall friction material composition.",
        "Illustrative examples of suitable organic friction modifiers include cashew dust, ground tire rubber, rubber dust (rubber powder or particles), nitrile rubber dust (unvulcanized product) and acrylic rubber dust (vulcanized product). Cashew dust and ground tire rubber are especially preferred. Any one or combination of two or more of these may be used.",
        "The content of this organic friction modifier, while not subject to any particular limitation, is generally at least 10 vol %, and preferably at least 13 vol %, but generally not more than 22 vol %, and preferably not more than 19 vol %, based on the overall friction material composition.",
        "No particular limitation is imposed on the method of manufacturing the friction material of the invention. For example, production may involve uniformly blending together the various above-described components in a suitable mixer such as a Henschel mixer, Loedige mixer or Eirich mixer to form a friction material composition. The composition is then typically preformed in a mold, following which the preform is molded at a temperature of 130 to 180\u00b0 C. and a pressure of 20 to 50 MPa for a period of 5 to 15 minutes. The resulting molded article is typically postcured by heat treatment at 140 to 250\u00b0 C. for 2 to 48 hours, then painted, baked and surface-ground as needed.",
        "When the inventive friction material is to be used as an automotive disc pad, production may be carried out by placing the preform obtained above on an iron or aluminum plate that has been pre-washed, surface-treated and coated with an adhesive, molding the preform in this state within a mold, and subsequently heat-treating, painting, baking and surface-grinding.",

        "The friction material of the invention undergoes an amount of strain that is linear with respect to the hydraulic line pressure, and thus provides a excellent brake feel. Moreover, the inventive friction materials have a torque developed in response to a pushing force at high speed and high temperature that is linear, and have a good effectiveness. Also, these friction materials minimize the attack of cast iron and cast steel disc rotors, disc pad wear and metal pickup, and have an excellent balance of all the above properties. Such qualities make the friction materials of the invention highly suitable for use as automotive friction materials, particularly disc pads.",
        "Examples of the invention and comparative examples are given below by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.",
        "The various components were formulated as shown in Table 1 and uniformly blended in a Loedige mixer to give friction material compositions. These compositions were preformed in a pressure mold under a pressure of 30 MPa for a period of 30 seconds to give preforms. The preforms were molded at a molding temperature and pressure of 160\u00b0 C. and 40 MPa for 10 minutes, then postcured by 5 hours of heat treatment at 200\u00b0 C., yielding automotive brake pads in the respective examples.",
