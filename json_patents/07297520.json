        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates generally to the use of large circular (LC)-sense molecule as a probe in an array system. The invention also relates to the use of LC-sense molecule library as probes in an array system. In particular, the present invention relates to DNA chip technology, which utilizes arrays having associated single stranded LC-sense molecules. The present invention also describes methods of producing such arrays, assays for using such arrays, kits containing such arrays, and applications thereof.",
        "2. General Background and State of the Art:",
        "Recent developments in DNA microarray technology permits one to monitor a large number of cellular transcripts in a parallel fashion (Schena et al., Science, 270, 467-470 (1995), DeRisi et al., Science, 278, 680-686 (1997), Iyer et al., Science, 283, 83-87 (1999)). Both physiological and pathological changes in the function of cells are associated with alterations of gene expression patterns. For example, development of a malignancy is typically associated with both overexpression of oncogenes and decreased expression of tumor suppressor genes. Identification of differentially expressed genes has been used as a tool to recognize genes that are involved in disease process.",
        "Various methods are available for detecting differentially expressed genes, including northern blot analysis (Alwine et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 74, 5350-5354 (1977)), S1 nuclease protection (Berk et al., Cell, 12, 721-732 (1977)), differential display (Liang et al., Science, 257, 967-971 (1992)), sequencing of cDNA libraries (Adams et al., Science, 252, 1651-1656 (1991), Okubo et al., Nature Genet., 2, 173-179 (1992)), serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) (Velculescu et al., Science, 270, 484-487 (1995)), subtractive hybridization (Hedrick et al., Nature, 308, 149-153 (1984)) and representational difference analysis (RDA) (Hubank et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 22, 5640-5648 (1994), Lisitsyn et al., Science, 259, 946-951 (1993)). But these techniques are limited by the amount of data obtained from one experiment and are time-consuming to perform. Using cDNA array hybridization, the expression of thousands or tens of thousands of genes can be studied simultaneously. This has previously been done by dotting the DNA onto nylon membranes and hybridizing with radioactively labeled cDNA (Augenlicht et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 88, 3286-3289 (1991)). Recently, protocols using cDNA microarrays on glass slides, or oligonucleotides on so-called gene chips, together with fluorescent labeled probes, have been introduced (Schena et al., Science, 270, 467-470 (1995), Lockhart et al., Nature Biotechnol, 14, 1675-1680 (1996)).",
        "Despite the wide variety of array technologies that have been developed, there is a continued need to identify new array devices to meet the needs of specific applications.",
        "The present invention overcomes the above-mentioned problems. The present invention provides methods of preparing LC-sense molecules, a library of LC-sense molecules, and a way of fabricating LC-sense arrays, which are combined with cDNA hybridization to validate its utility for detection of differences in expression profiles between different cells. Applicants provide an array using LC-sense molecules as probing agents. Certain bacteriophages, such as M13 bacteriophage, have single stranded circular genomes, which have been conventionally employed for DNA sequencing analyses as well as mutagenesis studies. For instance, M13 phagemid, which is a plasmid used in the construction of a recombinant bacteriophage, can be engineered to produce a large quantity of circular single stranded genomic DNA that contains a target-specific sense sequence insert. This approach for producing LC-sense molecule comprising a sense DNA insert provides numerous advantages such as greater resistance to enzymatic degradation associated with its covalently closed structure, higher binding affinity for complementary nucleic acids, high sequence fidelity, elimination of laborious target site search, no requirement for modification and easy large-scale production at a low cost.",
        "The present invention is directed to a library comprising distinct LC-sense molecules. The LC-sense molecule may comprise vector sequence and probe sequence, wherein the probe sequence is in sense orientation. The vector may be a single strand generating phagemid. Further, the LC-sense molecule may have a length of from about 1,000 to about 20,000 nucleotides. The distinct LC-sense molecules may be separated from each other or compartmentalized. In particular, the vector may be pSPORT1, pBluescriptII SK(+/\u2212) or KS(+/\u2212), pGEM-f, M13mp, pCR2.1, pGL2 or p\u03b2 gal. And further in particular, the vector may be M13 bacteriophage, f1 bacteriophage, or fd bacteriophage.",
        "In another aspect, the invention is also directed to an array comprising a plurality of distinct LC-sense molecules stably associated with surface of a support. The support may comprise a coating of amino-silane, poly-L-lysine or aldehyde. Further, the support may be a slide glass, ceramic, inorganic-organic composite, flexible plastic film, silicon, metal, or membrane.",

        "In the above-described method, the label may be streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, chemifluorescent or chemiluminescent. In particular, the label may be Cy3 or Cy5.",
        "In yet another embodiment, the invention is directed to a method for detecting presence of DNA in two or more samples of nucleic acid molecules, comprising:",

        "The present invention is based on the discovery that a large circular phage genomic molecule that includes a target specific sense region, is useful as an effective probe for its complementary target cDNA, in particular in an array setting. Preferably, the array is a microarray system. Preferably, the microarray system is high density in which the LC-sense molecule is spotted on a substrate plate. The inventive system can be used in a high-throughput manner in a massive array protocol to determine genes involved in various cellular physiological processes.",
        "As used herein, an \u201carray\u201d or \u201carray of regions on a solid support\u201d refers to a linear or two-dimensional array of preferably discrete regions, each having a finite area, formed on the surface of a solid support.",
        "As used herein, \u201carrayed library\u201d refers to individual single-stranded LC-sense primary recombinant clones (hosted in the single stranded genome of phage, phagemid, or other vector) that are placed in two-dimensional arrays in microtiter (multiwell) dishes or plates. Each primary clone can be identified by the identity of the plate and the clone location (row and column) on that plate. Arrayed libraries of clones can be used for many applications, including screening for a specific gene or genomic region of interest as well as for physical mapping.",
        "As used herein, the term \u201ccapable of hybridizing under high stringency conditions\u201d means annealing a strand of DNA complementary to the DNA of interest under highly stringent conditions. Likewise, \u201ccapable of hybridizing under low stringency conditions\u201d refers to annealing a strand of DNA complementary to the DNA of interest under low stringency conditions. \u201cHigh stringency conditions\u201d for the annealing process may involve, for example, high temperature and/or low salt content, which disfavor hydrogen-bonding contacts among mismatched base pairs. \u201cLow stringency conditions\u201d would involve lower temperature, and/or higher salt concentration than that of high stringency conditions. Such conditions allow for two DNA strands to anneal if substantial, though not near complete complementarity exists between the two strands, as is the case among DNA strands that code for the same protein but differ in sequence due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. Appropriate stringency conditions which promote DNA hybridization, for example, 6\u00d7SSC at about 45\u00b0 C., followed by a wash of 2\u00d7SSC at 50\u00b0 C. are known to those skilled in the art or can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.31-6.3.6. For example, the salt concentration in the wash step can be selected from a low stringency of about 2\u00d7SSC at 50\u00b0 C. to a high stringency of about 0.2\u00d7SSC at 50\u00b0 C. In addition, the temperature in the wash step can be increased from low stringency at room temperature, about 22\u00b0 C., to high stringency conditions, at about 75\u00b0 C. Other stringency parameters are described in Maniatis, T., et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring N.Y., (1982), at pp. 387-389; see also Sambrook J. et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Volume 2, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring, N.Y. at pp. 8.46-8.47 (1989).",
        "As used herein, \u201ccDNA library\u201d used with respect to the sense probe library tethered to the substrate refers to a library composed of LC-sense molecules specific to target messenger RNAs.",
        "As used herein, \u201ctarget cDNA library\u201d used with respect to the target library refers to a collection of all of the mRNA molecules present in a cell or organism, all turned into cDNA molecules with the enzyme reverse transcriptase, so that the library can then be probed for the specific cDNA (and thus mRNA) of interest.",
        "As used herein, \u201ccompartment\u201d or \u201ccompartments\u201d refers to a physical delineation of each member clone of the LC-sense molecule library. Physical delineation may be in the form of wells such as in multi-well plates. Commonly used are 96-well plates or 96-deep well plates. Another physical barrier may be air, such as by individual spotting on a flat sheet, glass or membrane. In this regard, either macroarray or microarray methods may be used. It is understood that by compartmentalization it is meant that the clone members are separated from each other. Other barriers may be by encapsulation of individual clones in a membranous material, and the like.",
        "As used herein, a \u201cdistinct LC-sense molecule\u201d, as applied to the LC-sense molecules forming a microarray, means an array member, which is distinct from other array members on the basis of a different LC-sense DNA sequence, and/or different concentrations of the same or distinct LC-sense molecule, and/or different mixtures of distinct or different-concentration LC-sense molecule. Thus an array of \u201cdistinct LC-sense molecule\u201d means an array containing, as its members, (i) distinct LC-sense molecule, which may have a defined amount in each member, (ii) different, graded concentrations of given-sequence LC-sense molecule, and/or (iii) different-composition mixtures of two or more distinct LC-sense molecule.",
        "As used herein, \u201cfilamentous phage\u201d is a vehicle for producing the LC-sense molecule of the invention. Phages or phagemids may be used. In this instance, the desired sequence is inserted or cloned into the vehicle so that when a single strand is generated by the phage or phagemid, the LC-sense molecule is generated. DNA or RNA bacteriophage may be used for this purpose. In particular, filamentous bacteriophage may be used. Filamentous phages such as M13, fd, and f1 have a filamentous capsid with a circular ssDNA molecule. Their life-cycle involves a dsDNA intermediate replicative form within the cell which is converted to a ssDNA molecule prior to encapsidation. This conversion provides a means to prepare ssDNA. The bacteriophage M13 has been adapted for use as a cloning vector.",
        "Phagemid vectors also have filamentous phage f1 Ori region. pBluescript (Stratagene, USA), pGEM-f (Promega, USA), M13mp, pCR2.1, pGL2, p\u03b2gal and pSPORT vector and their derivatives are examples. Preferentially, a phagemid vector of M13 bacteriophage such as pBluescript SK(+/\u2212) may be used. One advantage of using a recombinant viral vector based on M13 bacteriophage is that the vector can accommodate a variety of sizes of inserts.

It is understood that the size of the LC-sense molecule may be varied and optimized without undue experimentation so long as the LC-sense molecule selectively and specifically binds to its complementary cDNA.",
        "Alternatively, it is understood that there does not have to be an absolute upper or lower limit to the length of the large circular nucleic acid molecule. This is especially so when a vector is used to generate the large circular nucleic acid molecule, in which case the combination of the size of the vector sequence and the size of the insert sequence that encodes at least a portion of the target gene may control the length of the single stranded nucleic acid generated. Thus, in one embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule may be as long as the vector may accommodate.",

As a general matter, absolute complementarity may not be required for specific binding to occur between two nucleic acid molecules. Any LC-sense molecule having sufficient complementarity to form a stable duplex with the target cDNA is considered to have suitable specificity of binding between the two nucleic acid molecules because stable duplex formation depends on the sequence and length of the hybridizing LC-sense molecule and the degree of complementarity between the LC-sense molecule and the target sequence.",

The present invention also provides LC-sense DNA library as probe DNA for making arrays. LC-sense molecules specific to a large number of genes may be produced simultaneously in a small quantity or large quantity from a bacterial culture containing recombinant bacteriophages.

Thus, LC-sense molecules may be used as probes in any setting or device in which hybridization to its complementary DNA is desired.",
        "A variety of methods are currently available for making arrays of DNA probes. LC-sense molecules may be used in such systems as probes bound to the membrane such as in arrays of nucleic acid molecules. One method for making ordered arrays of DNA on a porous membrane is a \u201cdot blot\u201d approach. In this method, a vacuum manifold transfers a plurality, e.g., 96, aqueous samples of DNA from 3 millimeter diameter wells to a porous membrane. A common variant of this procedure is a \u201cslot-blot\u201d method in which the wells have highly-elongated oval shapes. The DNA is immobilized on the porous membrane by baking the membrane or exposing it to UV radiation. This is a manual procedure practical for making one array at a time and is usually limited to 96 samples per array.",
        "A more efficient technique employed for making ordered arrays of genomic fragments uses an array of pins dipped into the wells, e.g., the 96 wells of a microtiter plate, for transferring an array of samples to a substrate, such as a porous membrane. One array includes pins that are designed to spot a membrane in a staggered fashion, for creating an array of 9216 spots in a 22\u00d722 cm2 area.",
        "Recently, array systems have been devised for mass fabrication of microarrays characterized by (i) a large number of micro-sized assay regions separated by a distance of 50-200 microns or less, and (ii) a well-defined amount, typically in the picomole range, of LC-sense molecules associated with each region of the array (U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,522, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, especially as it relates to the microarray system).",

A library of such LC-sense molecules may be made.",
        "Thus, in another aspect of the inventions, it is understood that the LC-sense compounds may comprise either fragments of a target sequence or the entire gene sequence. Also, it is contemplated that several target specific sense sequences for a plurality of different genes may be inserted into one single stranded phage genome. As a result, a LC-sense molecule may comprise more than one region of target specific sense sequence.",
        "LC-sense compounds have strong replication fidelity because the compound is replicated by DNA polymerase in bacterial cells.

Preferably, in a region in an array the LC-sense molecule may be present in greater than a one to one ratio as compared with any complementary single stranded counterpart DNA that may be present. More preferably, the composition in a region in an array contains at least 95% LC-sense molecule. Even more preferably, the composition contains LC-sense molecule that is generated as a single stranded DNA during the life cycle of a phage which includes the insert, in which case only the single stranded LC-sense molecule may be present in the region in the array.",
        "High-Throughput Microarray System",
        "Large-scale expression profiling with arrays has emerged as a leading technology in the systematic analysis of cellular physiology (Young et al., Cell, 102, 9-15 (2000)). These arrays are now being applied to various applications including gene discovery (Kati et al., J. Pathol., 193, 73-79 (2001)), disease diagnosis (Alizadeh et al., Nature, 403, 503-511 (2000)), drug discovery (Leming et al., J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci., 40, 367-379 (2000)), toxicological research (Nuwaysir et al., Molecular Carcinogenesis, 24, 153-159 (1999)) and the like. The technology for production of microarrays utilize techniques such as building the probe oligonucleotides (usually 15-100 nucleotides) directly on the glass surface (Lipshutz et al., Biotechniques, 19, 442-447 (1995), Lipshutz et al., Nat. Genet., 21, 20-24 (1999), Singh-Gasson et al., Nat. Biotechnol., 17, 974-978 (1999)), or spotting a substrate with PCR products amplified from cDNA clone set or cDNA library (Duggan et al., Nat. Genet., 21, 10-14 (1999)). Production of arrays with oligonucleotide or PCR product has, however, some disadvantages. For example, preparation of tens of thousands of modified oligonucleotides requires sequence information, high product cost and time-consuming multiple steps, including laborious target sequence search for each gene, synthesis, desalting, column purification, concentration, modification and so on. Meanwhile, production of arrays that use PCR product requires plasmid purification, cDNA amplification with Taq polymerase, and DNA purification steps, which cost a great deal. Here, we devised an array with LC-sense molecules. Its utility as a binding agent probe for studying expression profile of genes has been demonstrated.",
        "M13 phagemid, plasmid for the construction of a recombinant bacteriophage, is engineered to produce a large quantity of the single stranded genomic DNA that contains sense sequence because of its f1 origin. The LC-sense molecules can be produced massively from bacterial culture of competent cells with recombinant M13 phagemids by coinfection with helper bacteriophages.",
        "In this regard, the capability of producing a large quantity of LC-sense molecules for use in array provides an advantage in lowering the cost of arrays, where conventionally the inability to easily produce large quantities of oligonucleotides and PCR produced larger cDNA products was a barrier to obtaining inexpensive array chips.",
        "The present invention also provides a high-throughput system for functional genomics using the LC-sense molecule library discussed above. The functional genomics system of the present invention may be used to rapidly and massively search for gene function. Thus, the LC-sense library may be used for determining the interrelationships among different gene products.",

        "The library of LC-sense molecules may be made by randomly and unidirectionally inserting a population of cDNA inserts as in a modified shot-gun approach, or by individually identifying the sequence of an insert and cloning the insert into the phage vector so that a unique, non-redundant library of clones of interest is prepared. It is understood that the source of the random gene unidirectional LC-sense library or unigene unidirectional LC-sense library or the host cells that may be tested need not be human. According to the principles of the invention, any source organism may be used such as, but not limited to, mammals, plants, and fungi. The host cell may be also any organism, so long as the LC-sense compound is capable of penetrating the cell membrane or cell wall.",
        "To validate the function of LC-sense molecules as binding agent for arrays, we firstly transformed recombinant pSPORT phagemid of 1,152 nonredundant clones into E. coli competent cell with a helper bacteriophage M13K07. The LC-sense molecules of each clone were then purified from culture supernatant and were concentrated up to 0.2\u02dc0.5 mg/ml on a large scale. With this method, we obtained 1,152 samples. As array substrates for binding agent, poly-L-lysine or amino-silane were coated on the surface of glass to enhance the immobilization of the nucleic acids (Schena et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 93, 10614-19 (1996)). After confirming the quality and quantity of LC-sense molecules by agarose gel electrophoresis, LC-sense arrays were prepared by spotting those molecules on silanized slide glasses using a microarrayer. After confirming the quality of poly(A+) RNA purified from normal and cancerous liver tissue, labelled cDNA probes were mixed and hybridized to LC-sense arrays comprising 1,152 nonredundant samples.",
        "RNA obtained from normal liver cells and cancerous liver tissue are reverse transcribed into cDNA in the presence of nucleotides labeled with radiolabelled or fluorescent tags. Cy3-dNTP and Cy5-dNTP dyes are the most commonly used fluorophores, as labeling agents. The incubation of the target with the conventional microarray comprising oligonucleotides or amplified cDNA product has been typically performed at 45\u00b0 C. or 65\u00b0 C., respectively, for aqueous hybridization buffers. However, we optimized hybridization temperature at 60\u00b0 C. based on the determination of melting temperature of single stranded LC-molecules. These distinctions of optimal temperature for hybridization reflect the structural difference between LC-sense molecule probes and conventionally used oligonucleotides or PCR products. Following hybridization, the LC-sense array was washed repeatedly to remove the unbound and non-specific signal. Scanning analysis by software showed that 29 of 1,152 genes were up-regulated and 6 genes were down-regulated in cancerous liver tissue as compared with normal tissue. With these results, we confirmed that LC-sense molecules work well as a probe on slide glass arrays.",
        "LC-sense array provides several advantages for use in an array system used for studying expression profile of genes. First, LC-sense molecules can be produced on a large scale with speed, accuracy and cost effectiveness from bacterial transformants, such as E. coli. Second, the phagemid vector can accommodate a variety of sizes of sense inserts. Due to its long sequence, binding specificity can be remarkably enhanced. Third, making an array with LC-sense molecules does not require the time consuming act of searching for target binding sequence. Fourth, LC-sense molecules have strong replication fidelity because the molecule is replicated by DNA polymerase in bacterial cells. Since DNA polymerase has proof reading capabilities, the fidelity of LC-sense molecule is greater than chemically synthesized oligonucleotides or cDNA that is amplified in a tube. Fifth, LC-sense molecules are cheaper to make than the chemically synthesized oligonucleotides or amplified PCR products. Finally, due to utilization of vector-based techniques, construction of a LC-sense molecule library with a large number of individual clones may be performed easily and rapidly. A library specific to a particular disease can be easily constructed from diseased cells or abnormal cells or tissue. From these libraries, we can easily produce LC-sense molecules on a large scale and discover a panel of disease-related genes, which may include those genes of unknown functions. Otherwise, from a library constructed with little or no redundancy among its members of the entire panel of human genes or genes of other organisms, diverse expression profile of various diseases can be achieved as described herein. In an additional step, for more efficient discovery of an anticancer drug, a combination of suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and cDNA array hybridization methods may be used (Kati et al., J. Pathol., 193, 73-79 (2001)). By utilizing phagemid vectors with f1 origin for the construction of the subtracted cDNA library, the process of making a unidirectional library of random genes overexpressed in a particular cell or tissue is made easier. Gene expression profile obtained from LC-sense arrays has been confirmed with further methods including real time PCR and northern blotting.",

Each slide was crosslinked with 300 mJ irradiation of short-wave UV (Stratalinker, Stratagene, USA) and stored in a desiccator until use.",
        "Rat TNF-\u03b1 cDNA was cloned into the multiple cloning site of the phagemid vector, pBluescript (pBS)-KS(+). Production of recombinant M13 phage was carried out by infecting M13K07 helper phages into bacterial cells that were already transformed with pBS KS (+) phagemid. F1 replication origin of the phagemid was utilized to generate LC-sense molecules for the target gene. Twenty percent polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) was added to the supernatant of an overnight culture of cells infected with helper phages. The bacteriophage precipitate was resuspended in TE (pH 8.0), and phage genomic DNA was isolated by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Purification of LC-sense molecules from the residual genomic DNA of helper bacteriophage and host bacterial cells was carried out either with 0.8% low melting point (LMP) agarose gel for small scale purification or with gel filtration column chromatography (1.0\u00d750 cm) for large scale purification. The column resin for gel filtration was superfine Sephacryl\u2122 S-1000 (molecular cutoff: 20,000 bp) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB, Sweden), and was packaged and equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.2 M NaCl (pH 8.3). The starting volume of the LC-molecules was adjusted to 5% of the gel void volume and DNA elution was carried out with the same buffer used for resin equilibration (flow rate: 0.3 ml/min). Samples were UV scanned at 260/280 nm with a dual UV detection system and were collected every 5 min during elution. Sample fractions were washed and precipitated with 70% cold ethanol and were resuspended in distilled ultra-pure water and PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) for subsequent experiments. The purified LC-molecules were tested for quantity and purity on a 1% agarose gel.",
        "Thermal denaturation of the single stranded LC-molecules of rat TNF-a and double stranded plasmid DNA (pBS]-KS(+) phagemid containing the TNF-a insert was performed in a solution of 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM sodium PIPES (Sigma, USA). DNA at 10 \u03bcg/ml (10 nM) was heated to 95\u00b0 C. and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature prior to denaturation experiments. The temperature was raised at a rate of 0.5\u00b0 C./3 min. Melting studies were carried out in a diode array spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier temperature controller (Hewlett Packard, USA).",
        "Total RNA preparation of normal and cancerous liver tissue was carried out with Tri reagent (MRC, USA) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Tissues were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and sliced into smaller pieces. Sliced tissues were then homogenized for 10 min in an optimal volume of Tri Reagent. Purification of poly(A)+ mRNA was done with a poly (A) Quick mRNA Isolation Kit (Stratagene, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Purified poly(A)+ mRNA was used as template for preparation of target DNAs.",
        "The overall procedure for hybridization was performed according to Dr. Patrick O. Brown's lab protocol (http://cmgm.stanford.edu/pbrown). Briefly, 2 \u03bcg each of poly(A)+ mRNA from liver normal and tumor tissue was reverse-transcribed using oligo-dT primers in the presence of Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP, respectively. The labeled cDNA was then purified through a microcon-30 column. The purified target cDNA was resuspended in 80 \u03bcl of hybridization solution (3\u00d7SSC and 0.3% SDS) and then denatured at 100\u00b0 C. for 2 min and applied to an array of LC-sense molecules. Hybridization was carried out at 60\u00b0 C. for 16 hr in a humidified chamber. Finally, the hybridized slide was washed once each in 2\u00d7SSC for 2 min, 0.1\u00d7SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min, and 0.1\u00d7SSC for 5 min and then spun-dried prior to scanning at room temperature.",
        "Fluorescent target cDNAs hybridized to a cDNA microarray were detected by scanning the slide with a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon instruments, USA). The PMT (photomultiplier tubes) value for Cy3 or Cy5 was 450 and 500, respectively. The scanned image was then analyzed using the GenePix Pro 3.0 software package. Signal intensity values were determined by subtracting the background median value from the intensity median value of each spot. Expression values were normalized by a single multiplicative normalization factor and applied to all Cy5/Cy3 ratios so that the median normalized Cy5/Cy3 ratio became 1.0.",
        "A recombinant phagemid was transformed into competent E. coli cells that had been infected with helper bacteriophages, M13K07. The transformed cells were incubated on an LB agar plate containing ampicillin (50 \u03bcg/ml) for overnight at 37\u00b0 C. A single colony was carefully isolated and seeded in 100 ml of LB liquid media (bactotryptone 10 g, yeast extract 5 g, NaCl 10 g/1000 ml, 50 \u03bcg/ml of ampicillin, and 70 \u03bcg/ml of kanamycin). Cells were then cultured for 14 hrs at 37\u00b0 C. with constant agitation. After centrifugation of bacterial cells at 6,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature, 100 ml of culture supernatant was mixed with 20 ml of Solution I (20% PEG 8000+2.5M NaCl) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The sample was then loaded in a column well containing borosilicate filters by applying vacumn for 10 min. The column was applied with 50 ml of Solution II (4M NaClO4, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) for both M13 lysis and binding, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min for complete lysis of bacteriophages. Vacuum was applied for 10 min to allow adsorption of LC-sense molecules to the filter. The column was then added with 100 ml of Solution III (80% EtOH, 20 mM NaCl, 2 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and applied with vacuum for 10 min. Washing step with Solution III was repeated again and the buffer solution was removed by applying vacuum for additional 15 min. LC-sense molecules was eluted with 10 ml of sterile water. LC-sense molecules were run on a 1% agarose gel and photographed under UV light for their quality and quantification.",
        "We prepared a microarray with LC-sense molecules (FIG. 1) to examine their utility in massive profiling of differential gene expression. Competent E. coli cells containing a helper bacteriophage M13K07 was transformed with recombinant pSPORT1 phagemids of 1,152 nonredundant clones to produce LC-sense molecules. High throughput production of LC-sense molecules was performed in a 96-well format. The purified LC-sense molecules were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and photographed under UV light (FIG. 2). The single stranded DNA samples of LC-sense molecules were arrayed on a silanized slide glass using a microarrayer.",
        "The structural difference between single stranded LC-sense molecules and the double stranded phagemid DNA containing the TNF-\u03b1 insert was also examined by measuring the melting temperature (Tm1/2). When absorbance at 260 nm was monitored for double-stranded phagemid DNA while temperature was raised progressively, a typical chromatic change was detected around 87\u00b0 C. (FIG. 3A). However, when single stranded LC-sense molecules were examined for their melting temperature, the chromatic change of a mild slope was detected at around 54\u00b0 C., indicating the denaturation of intra-molecular short duplexes (FIG. 3B). These results confirmed that the LC-sense molecules were single stranded molecules. Further, an optimal hybridization temperature was determined based on these results.",
        "The quality of RNA often determines outcome of microarray experiments. Poly(A)+ mRNAs prepared from normal and cancerous liver tissues were used to synthesize Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP-labelled cDNAs, respectively. The labeled cDNAs were mixed and allowed to hybridize to probe cDNA seeded on a DNA chip at 65\u00b0 C. LC-sense microarray was washed and scanned by scanner (FIG. 4A), and analyzed by software. The data were then scatter-plotted after log2 transformation (FIG. 4B). Scanned images demonstrated that the quality of the RNA is pure enough to be of use for further labeling and hybridization to LC-sense array.",
        "Poly(A)+ mRNA that was prepared and confirmed for its integrity as in EXAMPLE 8.3 was used to detect the expression profile of genes in cancerous liver tissue using the same procedures as described above except that labeled target cDNAs are loaded on a LC-sense microarray, and hybridization was performed at 60\u00b0 C. LC-sense microarray was then scanned and analyzed for expression profile (FIG. 5). The data were then scatter-plotted after log2 transformation (FIG. 6). Genes with the sum of median value lower than 200 were excluded for further data processing. From the experiments, we discovered that 29 (\u02dc2.5%) of 1,152 genes were up-regulated in liver cancer tissue (Table 1). Among the 29 genes, in particular, CD44 antigen (Endo K. et al., J. Hepatology, 32(1):78-84, 2000), inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (Jackson R. C. et al., Nature 256(5515):331-333, 1975), multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (Nakajima K. et. al. Intern. Med. 30(1):20-24, 2000), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (Arizono K. et. al. Life Sci. 53(12):1031-1037, 1993) were previously reported as those involved in liver cancer progression. On the other hand, 6 of 1,152 genes were down-regulated in liver cancer tissue (Table 2). Among the 6 (\u02dc0.5%) genes, in particular, fibrinogen-like 1 (Kohno T. et. al., Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 91(11):1103-1110, 2000) was previously reported that its expression was down-regulated in adult T cell leukemia. These results indicate that LC-sense molecules can be used as binding agents for microarrays to detect genes with differential expression.",
        "Production of LC-sense molecules on a large scale would be required for making a large number of DNA microarrays with consistent and dependable quality. Large scale production of LC-sense molecules has been accomplished with a semi-automatic \u201cprototypical\u201d instrument. The instrument is equipped with 96 purification columns with 37 mm inside diameter, two 8-well dispensers with 30 or 100 ml pumping capacity respectively and a vacuum manifold (60 W\u00d742 L\u00d760 H). A recombinant phagemid was transformed into competent E. coli cells containing a helper bacteriophage M13K07. A single colony was picked and seeded in 100 ml of LB liquid media, and cultured for 14 hrs at 37\u00b0 C. with constant agitation. The LC-sense molecules were purified from 100 ml of the culture supernatant with the semi-automatic purification instrument. LC-sense molecules prepared on a large scale were run on a 1% agarose gel to test both their quality and quantity (FIG. 7). Out of 100 ml culture supernatant, approximately 200 \u03bcg of LC-sense molecules were obtained by using the instrument.",
