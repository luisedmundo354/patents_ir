        "This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/564,790 filed on Apr. 23, 2004.",
        "Although there are a large number of agents that inhibit microbial infections in culture or even when administered systemically, many of these agents are not effective when administered via topical ocular application as a result of inadequate penetration of the drug through the cornea. Even within a structural class the observed in vivo activity of a compound depends on both the anti-microbial activity and the ability of the compound to localize at the appropriate concentration in the affected tissue. The present invention is directed to the discovery of physical properties that control the topical ocular activity of drugs (e.g., fluoroquinolone antibiotics), as well as to the provision of a method for identifying compounds that have sufficient corneal penetration capability to be administered via topical application to the eye.",
        "The single cellular epithelial layer of the cornea is the primary barrier to the trans-corneal penetration of drug molecules. Although a number of methods have been used to enhance penetration across the corneal epithelium, these methods tend to disrupt the intercellular connections that serve as a defensive barrier protecting the eye from invasions by pathogens. Disruptions in this barrier often result in toxicity which is amplified upon repeated application.",
        "A superior approach is to enhance trans-celluar penetration by designing or identifying compounds with optimum physical properties. Compounds in solution or suspension need to partition from the topical formulation into the lipid rich cellular membrane of the corneal epithelium, traverse the cell and exit through the basolateral epithelial cell membrane. As long as the formulation is in contact with the exterior surface of the eye, the steep concentration gradient serves as the driving force for penetration into the cornea. In this limited time, the physical properties of the molecule in the formulation govern the rate of drug penetration into and through the corneal epithelium.",
        "Aqueous solubility and lipophilicity are two factors that govern the rate a drug penetrates the cornea (FIG. 1). However, other physical properties of the drug molecule (e.g., pKa and distribution coefficient) may also have an impact on corneal permeability.",
        "For most topical ocular drugs, the rate-limiting barrier to corneal penetration is the two top cell layers of the corneal epithelium which are lipoidal in nature (FIG. 1B). A drug's lipophilicity is estimated by its octanol/water partition coefficient, koc, though the logarithm of this value, log P, is more often reported. If one takes into consideration the pH of the aqueous phase, the proportion of drug in its non-ionized or preferentially absorbed form can be determined, along with the distribution coefficient, or DC (Table 1). Due to the tri-laminate structure of the corneal membrane which effectively blocks passive diffusion by most molecules, the optimal n-octanol/water log P range for transcellular corneal drug penetration is 2-3.16",
        "The pioneering work of Schoenwald found that corneal permeability is a function of lipophilicity for steroids17 and \u03b2-blockers.18 However, Wu et al.19 found no such correlation for a small set of cephalosporins. Both, Fukada et al.1 and Liu et al.20 demonstrated that corneal permeability correlates with fluoroquinolone lipophilicity. Also Ruiz-Garcia et al.21 observed that lipophilicity is the main factor governing intestinal fluoroquinolone absorption.",
        "Several studies examining the tear concentrations and corneal penetration properties of fluoroquinolone antibiotics have been published.8-11 However, only a limited amount of information has been published regarding the corneal penetration properties of the new fourth-generation fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin. The present inventors conducted a study to (i) investigate the physical properties underlying the superior corneal penetration of moxifloxacin and (ii) develop a method for predicting the corneal permeability of moxifloxacin and other fluoroquinolones using in vitro data and mathematical models. This work resulted in the development of a new and more reliable method for predicting the corneal penetration of drug molecules.",
        "A principal objective of the present invention is to provide a method for identifying drug molecules having the physical properties required for significant levels of corneal penetration.",
        "A further objective of the present invention is to provide a method for differentiating or ranking drug molecules within a specified class (e.g., fluoroquinolones) based on the abilities of the individual molecules to penetrate the cornea.",
        "The present invention is based on the discovery that corneal penetration of drug molecules is highly predicted by the permeation rate of the molecules in MDCK (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney) cells. In addition, permeability in the MDCK cell line can be predicted by the experimentally determined distribution coefficient described herein.",
        "The above-cited discoveries resulted from a study of the corneal penetration characteristics of moxifloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. The study, which is discussed in greater detail below, demonstrated that the MDCK permeability values for moxifloxacin and other fluoroquinolones tested correlate very closely with actual in vivo corneal penetration values for these drug molecules. Moreover, the study showed that the physical properties that have typically been used in the past to predict corneal permeability (e.g., lipophilicity, aqueous solubility, pKa and distribution coefficient) are considerably less accurate than the method of the present invention.",

        "FIG. 2 is a graph showing the correlation between predicted corneal penetration values determined in accordance with the method of the present invention and actual corneal penetration rates.",
        "The present invention is directed to the use of a new in vitro model for evaluating the ability of a drug molecule to penetrate the cornea. The model involves the use of MDCK cell permeability values to predict the ability of drug molecules to penetrate the cornea. The MDCK permeability values of drug molecules can be determined by means of known methods, such as the methods described in the following scientific articles:\n\n    1. Horio, M, Pastan, I, Gottesman, M M, and Handler, J S. Transepithelial transport of vinblastine by kidney-derived cell lines. Application of a new kinetic model to estimate in situ Km of the pump.

Such methods are further illustrated in Example 1 below. Various commercial scientific laboratories may be utilized to obtain MDCK permeation values (e.g., Absorption Systems, Exton, Pa., USA).",
        "The method of the present invention comprises the following steps: (1) determining the MDCK permeation value for a drug molecule; and (2) entering said value in a suitable linear or quadratic statistical model to calculate a predicted corneal permeability value for said molecule. The statistical model is created by obtaining MDCK permeation values and corneal penetration values for at least two representative drug molecules, plotting those values on a graph and deriving a linear or quadratic statistical model from the graph. The following equation, which was derived from the data presented in Table 2 below, is an example of a statistical model of the type mentioned above:\n\nCorneal Permeability=5.41(MDCK Permeability)\u22120.01(MDCK Permeability)2",
        "As further illustrated below, the predicted corneal permeation value can then be compared with the predicted values of other molecules for which actual in vivo corneal penetration data are available. This comparison provides a basis for assessing the potential corneal permeability of a drug molecule prior to actual testing in in vivo or ex vivo animal models.",
        "The above-described method of predicting corneal permeability provides a means for evaluating large numbers of drug molecules, relative to the potential ability to administer the compounds via topical application to the eye, without performing expensive and time-consuming tests in in vivo and/or ex vivo corneal penetration models. The method is therefore quite valuable in screening drug molecules for possible utility in the ophthalmic field, as well as in structure-activity relationship (\u201cSAR\u201d) studies directed to identification of the most efficacious compounds within a specified genus or class.",
        "The methods of the present invention are described in greater detail below relative to research conducted with a specific class of drug molecules, i.e., fluoroquinolone antibiotics. However, the ability of the methods to predict corneal penetration is not limited to this class of drugs. Rather, the methods are broadly applicable to all types and classes of drugs.",
        "Fluoroquinolone antibiotics have become the treatment of choice for ocular infections in recent years. Currently, seven fluoroquinolones have been approved for ophthalmic use namely, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and more recently gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. The structures of these compounds are shown below:",
        "",
        "These antibiotics possess excellent activity against a wide range of bacteria3-6 and act by interfering with DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV.7 Both are key enzymes involved in DNA replication. Fourth-generation fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin are more balanced in their inhibition of these two enzymes making them less likely to develop resistant strains. Moxifloxacin also contains a bulky C-7 substituent that causes it to be a poor substrate for bacterial efflux pumps and effectively prevents it from being removed from the bacterial cell.7 Thus, more of the antibiotic accumulates within the bacterial cell resulting in more rapid cell death.",
        "The above-described method for predicting corneal permeability was utilized to calculate the predicted corneal penetration capabilities of moxifloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. The physical properties of the compounds (e.g., aqueous solubility, lipophilicity, etc.) were also determined. The procedures utilized are described in Example 1, below.",
        "In order to determine if the predicted corneal penetration values determined by the above-described method accurately reflect the actual corneal penetration properties of moxifloxacin and other fluoroquinolones, an ex vivo corneal penetration study in a rabbit model was conducted. The procedures utilized in that study are described in Example 2, below.",
        "Materials",
        "Moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin were purchased in 100 mg quantities from Sequoia Research Products Ltd, UK.",
        "Methods",
        "In vitro MDCK cell permeability. Permeability and transport studies were conducted and the data were analyzed at Absorption Systems, Exton, Pa., using methods previously described.12,13 MDCK(MDR) monolayers were grown to confluence on collagen-coated, microporous, polycarbonate membranes in 12-well Costar Transwell plates. To ensure monolayer integrity, the trans epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured. Cell monolayers with TEER values>1900 \u03a9\u00b7cm2 were used for these transport studies. The permeability assay buffer was Hank's Balanced Salt Solution containing 10 mM HEPES and 15 mM glucose at a pH of 7.0-7.2. Permeability through a cell-free (blank) membrane was studied to determine non-specific binding and free diffusion of the test article through the device. Dosing solution concentrations of the test articles were 10 \u03bcM in assay buffer. At each time point, 1 and 2 hours, a 200-\u03bcL aliquot was taken from the receiver chamber and replaced with fresh assay buffer. Cells were dosed on the apical side [apical-to-basolateral, absorptive transport, (B-A)] or basolateral side [basolateral-to-apical, secretory transport, (B-A)] and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO2 and 90% relative humidity. Each determination was performed in duplicate. Lucifer Yellow permeability was measured for each monolayer after the experiment, to ensure that the cell monolayer integrity and viability was not compromised by the test article. Post experiment Lucifer Yellow permeability in monolayers was between 0.24-0.75\u00d710\u22126 cm/s.",
        "To determine the transport of compounds in the absence of functional P-gp activity, the above experimental conditions were used but in the presence of the P-gp inhibitor cyclosporin A (CSA).14 For the studies using CSA, cells were pre-incubated for 30 minutes with the inhibitor (10 \u03bcM) and washed; during the permeation determination period CSA (10 \u03bcM) was present on both sides of the membrane. The Papp A-B determined in the presence of CSA was taken as an estimate of the permeability attributed to passive diffusion for the compound (Papp PD).",
        "Aqueous solubility determination. The compound of interest was added to 0.1M phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 and the pH was adjusted as desired. Samples containing an excess of un-dissolved material were stirred at ambient temperature for a minimum of 18 hours. Sample pH was adjusted as required and the mixture stirred an additional 15 minutes and filtered through a 0.45 micron nylon filter. The filtrate was analyzed by RP-HPLC against concentration standards for the compound of interest.",
        "Distribution coefficient determination. Partitioning of compounds between n-octanol and aqueous buffer was determined at pH 5.0 and pH 7.4 using 0.1M acetate and 0.1M phosphate buffer respectively. The initial concentration (C1) of compound in buffer and the buffer concentration following extraction with n-octanol (C2) were determined by RP-HPLC analysis against concentration standards for the specific compound. The distribution coefficient (DC) of a compound at a given pH was calculated using the equation DCpH=(C1\u2212C2)/C2.",
        "pKa determination. Ionization constants were determined by potentiometric titration (Kyoto AT-310 Potentiometric Titrator) in water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent such as methanol, acetone, or acetonitrile. If a solvent mixture was used, the nominal pKa values were plotted against the percentage of organic solvent to provide by extrapolation the pKa of the compound in water.",
        "Computed properties. a log P, aMR and C-7 \u03c0 values were computed using the Ghose algorithm.2 The log(DC7.0) values were computed using the log(DC) module from Advanced Chemical Development.15. The results of the calculations are shown in Table 1 below.",
        "Rabbits were sacrificed by first anaesthetizing with ketamine (30 mg/Kg) and xylazine (6 mg/Kg) followed by an injection of an overdose of SLEEPAWAY\u00ae (sodium pentobarbital, 1 ml of a 26% solution) into the marginal ear vein. The intact eyes, along with the lids and conjunctival sacs were then enucleated and immediately stored in about 70 ml of fresh BSS PLUS\u00ae Sterile Irrigating Solution (Alcon Laboratories, Inc.) saturated with O2/CO2 (95:5). Within one hour, corneas were mounted in the modified perfusion chamber as described by Schoenwald and Huang (G1). BSS PLUS\u00ae solution was used as the receiving and rinsing solution throughout the perfusion experiments. Steady-state conditions were used in order to determine the apparent permeability coefficients. After mounting the corneas in the chamber, 7.5 mls of BSS PLUS\u00ae solution was added to the receiving chamber (endothelial side of the cornea). Then, 7 mls of 0.1 mMole solutions of each fluoroquinolone prepared in BSS PLUS\u00ae solution was added into the donor chamber (epithelial side of the cornea). Throughout the experiment, both solutions were bubbled continuously with O2/CO2 (95:5) at the rate of about one bubble per second. This provides mixing of the solution in each chamber, oxygenation of the cornea, and pH control. Samples (0.15 ml) were withdrawn from the receiving chamber at 30 min intervals over a period of five hours. BSS PLUS\u00ae solution (0.15 ml) was added back to the receiving chamber after each withdrawal to compensate for loss of volume.",
        "At the end of each permeability experiment, The final volume of the receiving chambers was noted, and the viability of the corneas was assessed by determining their hydration level: The corneas were trimmed of excess scleral tissue and conjunctiva, blotted, weighed, dried overnight at room temperature under vacuum over phosphorus pentoxide, and then re-weighed. All corneas were found to have the normal hydration level of 76-80%.",
        "The apparent permeability coefficients (Papp, cm/sec) were determined by means of the following equation:\n\nPapp=rate/(60\u00d7A\u00d7C)\n\nwherein the rate is the steady state accumulation of glucocorticoid in the receiving chamber in units of \u03bcg/min; A is the corneal surface area, exposed within the chambers, in units of cm2\u2014a value of 1.087 cm2 was used in the calculations; C is the steady state measured concentration of glucocorticoid in the donor solution in units of \u03bcg/ml or ppm; and 60 is the conversion of minutes to seconds. The results are shown in Table 1.",
