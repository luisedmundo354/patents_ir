    "abstract": "The present invention relates to pressure sensitive adhesive compositions prepared from novel anionic block copolymers of aromatic vinyl compounds and conjugated dienes. The block copolymers are a mixture of a high molecular weight linear and/or radial block copolymer component (SBC1 and/or SBC2), and a diblock copolymer component (D1). The block copolymer may be combined with other block copolymers, tackifying resins, oils and other components to form the adhesives of the present invention. The pressure sensitive adhesives of the present invention maintain their performance at elevated temperatures and fail cohesively making them particularly useful for die-cuttable label applications.

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "This invention relates to pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) compositions prepared from novel anionic block copolymers of aromatic vinyl compounds and conjugated dienes. The invention further relates to die-cuttable labels and decals formed using the pressure sensitive adhesive composition.",
        "2. Background of the Art",
        "Pressure sensitive adhesives comprising styrenic block copolymers are well known.",
        "The block structure of the polymer gives adhesives having high shear and peel strengths and high upper service temperatures. However, the high strength of such adhesives is not suitable for all applications. For instance, formulators would like the ability to adjust the cohesive strength of an adhesive based on a block copolymer to improve the die-cutability of PSA labels or to achieve a cohesive failure mode in a peel test.",
        "Traditional approaches to improve the die-cutability of block copolymer based adhesives have been to reduce the cohesive strength by incorporation of diblock copolymer as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,096,203. Other approaches are to include low molecular weight, liquid rubbers as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,274,036. These approaches do serve to reduce the cohesive strength of the adhesive formulations. However, with the use of conventional block copolymer compositions, the high temperature performance is deleteriously reduced as the cohesive strength is lessened.",
        "We have found that certain new and novel polymers will allow the preparation of improved pressure sensitive adhesive compositions. In particular, adhesives containing the presently claimed high molecular weight, low coupled (i.e., high diblock fraction) polymer composition maintain their high temperature performance while providing adhesives which fail cohesively. This heretofore unattainable balance of properties allows the variation of peel strength, where the peel fails cohesively, independently of the high temperature performance of the adhesive. This is particularly useful in the construction of die-cuttable adhesives. In this application, the adhesive must have low cohesive strength so it can be cut into the desired shape and the unwanted matrix removed, but it must also maintain its high temperature performance to prevent adhesive bleed into a label facestock paper. The present invention addresses this need.",
        "In addition, the pressure sensitive adhesive composition of the present invention may comprise ester-type plasticizers typically used as PVC plasticizers. This behavior is unexpected for adhesives based on styrenic block copolymers since the ester-type plasticizers generally segregate into the styrenic endblocks and destroy the strength of the adhesive. Surprisingly, we have found the pressure sensitive adhesive compositions of the present invention able to tolerate relatively high levels of ester-type plasticizers. This makes the invention further useful as an adhesive for PVC labels and decals.",
        "In one aspect of the present invention we have discovered a novel pressure sensitive adhesive composition comprising from 10 to 45 parts by weight of a block copolymer composition having (i) a high molecular weight linear and/or radial multiblock copolymer component along with (ii) a lower molecular weight diblock component, 40 to 70 parts by weight of a tackifier, 5 to 40 parts by weight of an extending oil, and from 0 to 15 parts by weight of an ester-type plasticizer. The block copolymer composition comprises from 5 to 70% by weight of a first block copolymer which is a linear styrenic block copolymer (SBC1) having an apparent molecular weight greater than 250,000 or a radial styrenic block copolymer (SBC2) having apparent arm molecular weights greater than 125,000 or mixtures thereof, and a second block copolymer (D1) which is a styrenic diblock copolymer having an apparent molecular weight of 120,000 to 250,000.",
        "In another aspect the present invention is a die-cuttable label comprising the pressure sensitive adhesive composition and a label stock backing where the backing can be paper or a synthetic film.",
        "In yet another aspect the present invention is a die-cuttable decal comprising the pressure sensitive adhesive composition and a plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) film.",
        "The pressure sensitive adhesive compositions of the present invention have a unique balance of high temperature strength and room temperature peel properties. As such they are particularly useful as die-cuttable label and decal adhesives. In general, they will be useful for any application where the failure mode of the adhesive in a peel test will be varied independently of the high temperature strength. Furthermore, the adhesive composition maintains its strength even in the presence of modest amounts of ester plasticizers. As such, the adhesive compositions of the present invention are useful for plasticized PVC labels and decals.",
        "One essential component of the present invention is the novel block copolymer composition. The novel block copolymer composition comprises a high molecular weight styrenic block copolymer elastomer combined with a lower molecular weight polymer, preferably a diblock polymer. Preferably, the styrenic block copolymer elastomer has an apparent molecular weight in the range of 250,000 to 800,000 if said copolymer is a linear polymer, or in the range of 500,000 to 1,500,000 if said copolymer is a branched or star-shaped polymer. Most preferably the styrenic block copolymer elastomer constituents are selected from the group consisting of\n\nA-B-A-(B)p or (A-B)2X\n\nwherein A represents the polymer block substantially made of an aromatic vinyl compound, typically a polystyrene block; B represents a polymer block substantially made of a conjugated diene, typically a polybutadiene block, p is 0 or 1 and X is the residue of a coupling agent.",
        "These preferred styrenic block copolymer elastomer constituents are selected from a larger group of styrenic block copolymers, that all may be used in the compositions of the present invention, consisting of those of the formulae\n\n(B)p-(A-B)2X; or (B)p-A(B-A)n-(B)p,\u2003\u2003(linear SBC1)\n\n((B)p(A-B)n)mX\u2003\u2003(radial SBC2)\n\nwherein A, B, p and X have the meaning set out above, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and m is an integer greater than 2.",
        "The expression \u201csubstantially made\u201d as used herein means that the polymer block referenced consists primarily of the indicated monomer to such an extent that the essential character of the polymer block is preserved. In the case of the A block \u201csubstantially made\u201d means that sufficient aromatic vinyl compound is used, for instance at least 50% by weight, to provide a hard block A having a glass transition temperature of greater than 25\u00b0 C. In the case of the block B the expression \u201csubstantially made\u201d means that sufficient conjugated diene is used, for instance at least 70% by weight, to provide an elastomer block having a glass transition temperature below 25\u00b0 C.",
        "The content of the aromatic vinyl compound comprising the A block in the styrenic block copolymer is from 10 to 50% by weight, preferably from 15 to 40% by weight.",
        "The vinyl aromatic compound may be selected from compounds having 8 to 18 carbon atoms per molecule. For instance, some representative examples thereof include: styrene; 1-vinylnaphthalene; 4-methylstyrene; 3,5-diethylstyrene; 4-propylstyrene; 2,4,6-trimethylstyrene; 4-phenylstyrene; 2-ethyl,4-benzylstyrene; 2,3,4,5-tetraethylstyrene; 3-ethyl-1-vinylnaphthalene; alpha-methylstyrene, and the like. Preferred examples comprise 4-methylstyrene, styrene and mixtures thereof, styrene being most preferred. Compounds that may be copolymerized and form part of the A block(s) maybe selected from the conjugated dienes hereafter, and other anionically polymerizable, ethylenically unsaturated compounds, such as vinylcyclohexane, methylmethacrylate and the like. Most preferably each polymer block A is a polystyrene block.",
        "Block B is preferably made from butadiene, isoprene or mixtures thereof. Conjugated dienes that can be used, preferably having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule, further include 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, piperylene, 3-butyl-1,3-octadiene, phenyl-1,3-butadiene, and the like. Said block(s) may also comprise other monomers, such as the vinyl aromatic compounds mentioned herein above. Most preferably block B is a polybutadiene block.",
        "As is known, butadiene (and other conjugated dienes) may polymerize in 1,4-addition manner and/or 1,2-addition manner. The latter results in pendant vinyl groups. It is known in the art to use styrenic block copolymers having relatively high vinyl content, e.g. up to 70% and higher (based on the conjugated diene) by polymerizing the conjugated diene monomer in the presence of a polar cosolvent and/or at a relatively cool polymerization temperature. In producing the polymer block (B) under ordinary conditions a vinyl content of less than 25% is obtained. Both high vinyl and ordinary vinyl styrenic block copolymers may be used.",
        "The block copolymer elastomer and the second block copolymer may be used in relative amounts of 15 to 70% by weight (SBC1 and/or SBC2) and 85 to 30% by weight (D1), respectively, but preferably in relative amounts 20 to 50% by weight (SBC1 and/or SBC2) and 80 to 50% by weight (D1). One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the performance of the pressure sensitive adhesive compositions will vary and that the optimal performance for any application will be found by varying the relative amounts within the aforementioned range.",
        "Depending on their method of preparation, these block copolymers are known to comprise diblock copolymers of formula A-B in various amounts. Indeed, in coupling reactions, the diblock copolymers of formula A-B have the same molecular weight as the arms in the coupled polymer. The co-produced diblock copolymer of formula A-B may be the second block copolymer (D1) component of the polymer composition, provided it has an apparent molecular weight in the range of from 10,000 to 250,000 and is present in an amount in the range of 85 to 30% by weight basis the polymer composition. This is the preferred embodiment. On the other hand, the second block copolymer (D1) may be a separate polymer, selected from the polymers mentioned herein before. The second block copolymer (D1) may also be a diblock copolymer produced independent of the preparation of the block copolymer elastomer (SBC1 and/or SBC2).",
        "The polymer composition that has been found to be most suitable for the present application is a high molecular weight styrene-butadiene-styrene coupled block copolymer with a large amount of diblock, with the following characteristics:\n\n    \n    \n        1. styrene content in the range of 25\u201340%, preferably about 30% by weight;\n        2. diblock molecular weight 180,000\u2013215,000, preferably about 200,000;\n        3. diblock content 70\u201385%, preferably 80% by weight (which corresponds with a coupling efficiency of 15\u201330, preferably 20%); and\n        4. having a linear structure (manufactured with a difunctional coupling agent), having an apparent molecular weight (SBS) of 30,000\u201340,000//300,000\u2013350,000//30,000\u201340,000, preferably 36,000\u2013328,000\u201336,000.",
        "The term \u201capparent molecular weight\u201d, as used throughout the present specification, means the molecular weight, as measured by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC), relative to commercially available poly(styrene) calibration standards (according to ASTM D6474-99). One skilled in the art can readily convert \u201capparent\u201d molecular weight to \u201creal\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d molecular weight according to known compositionally dependent conversions. Alternately, in the case of coupled block copolymers having styrene endblocks, one may calculate the true or real molecular weight from the polystyrene content as measured by 1H NMR and the styrene endblock molecular weights as measured by GPC. For example, a styrene/butadiene block copolymer having the structure (A-B)2X with apparent molecular weight of (36,000\u2013164,000)2X and 30% weight bound styrene will have a real molecular weight of (36,000\u201384,000)2X.",
        "One of the components used in the adhesives and sealants of the present invention is a tackifying resin. Tackifying resins include both A block compatible resins and B block compatible resins. The A block compatible resin may be selected from the group consisting of coumarone-indene resin, polyindene resin, poly(methyl indene) resin, polystyrene resin, vinyltoluene-alphamethylstyrene resin, alphamethylstyrene resin and polyphenylene ether, in particular poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene ether). Such resins are e.g. sold under the trademarks \u201cHERCURES\u201d, \u201cENDEX\u201d, \u201cKRISTALEX\u201d, \u201cNEVCHEM\u201d and \u201cPICCOTEX\u201d. Resins compatible with the B block maybe selected from the group consisting of compatible C5 hydrocarbon resins, hydrogenated C5 hydrocarbon resins, styrenated C5 resins, C5/C9 resins, styrenated terpene resins, fully hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated C9 hydrocarbon resins, rosin esters, rosin derivatives and mixtures thereof. These resins are sold under the trademarks \u201cREGALITE\u201d, \u201cREGALREZ\u201d, \u201cESCOREZ\u201d, \u201cWINGTACK\u201d and \u201cARKON\u201d.",
        "The amount of tackifier varies from about 0 to about 700 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight block copolymer, preferably about 100 to about 700 parts by weight per hundred parts block copolymer. In the present invention, in which the amount of block copolymer is from 10 to 45 parts by weight, the preferred amount of tackifier corresponds to 40 to 70 parts by weight, and the most preferred amount is from 45 to 60 parts by weight.",
        "Another one of the components used in the adhesives of the present invention is an extending oil. Especially preferred are the types of oils that are compatible with the B blocks. While oils of higher aromatic content are satisfactory, those petroleum-based white oils having less than 50% aromatic content are preferred. Such oils include both paraffinic and naphthenic oils. The oils should additionally have low volatility, preferably having an initial boiling point above about 500\u00b0 F.",

        "The amount of oil employed varies from about 0 to about 400 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight block copolymer, preferably about 10 to about 400 parts by weight per hundred parts block copolymer. In the present invention, in which the amount of block copolymer is from 10 to 45 parts by weight, the preferred amount of extending oil corresponds to 5 to 40 parts by weight, and the most preferred amount is from 10 to 30 parts by weight.",
        "Another one of the components used in the adhesives of the present invention is an ester-type plasticizer. Especially preferred are organic ester plasticizers typically employed in poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) flexibilization. These plasticizers may be compatible with either the A blocks or the B blocks. Examples of plasticizers useful in the present invention are dioctyl phthalate (DOP), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), and butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP). The preferred plasticizer is butyl benzyl phthalate and is obtainable as Santicizer 160 from Ferro Corp.",

        "If the adhesive composition is to be applied from solvent solution, the organic portion of the formulation will be dissolved in a solvent or blend of solvents. Aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene, xylene or Shell Cyclo Sol 53 are suitable. Aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane, naphtha or mineral spirits may also be used. If desired, a solvent blend consisting of a hydrocarbon solvent with a polar solvent can be used. Suitable polar solvents include esters such as isopropyl acetate, ketones such as methyl isobutyl ketone, and alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol. The amount of polar solvent used depends on the particular polar solvent chosen and on the structure of the particular polymer used in the formulation. Usually, the amount of polar solvent used is between 0 and 50% wt in the solvent blend.",
        "Alternatively, the adhesive composition may be applied as a hot melt. Various methods of melt mixing are known and any method that produces a homogeneous composition without significant degradation is suitable. Typically, all components are combined and mixed in suitable mixing equipment like a sigma-blade mixer or a twin screw extruder at temperatures ranging from 130 to 200\u00b0 C. until a homogeneous composition is obtained, usually less than 3 hours. The hot melt adhesive composition can then be applied to the appropriate substrate using a variety of methods including spray coating, film extrusion, multi-line extrusion, multi-dot extrusion and the like.",
        "The pressure sensitive adhesives of the present invention must have aggressive tack and good peel and shear strength. Importantly, the adhesives must also have excellent high temperature strength. Typically, the high temperature strength is measured as the shear adhesion failure temperature (SAFT, ASTM D4498). The adhesives of the present invention typically are characterized by SAFT values greater than 60\u00b0 C. Preferably, the SAFT value is greater than 70\u00b0 C., more preferably greater than 80\u00b0 C., and most preferably greater than 90\u00b0 C.",
        "The adhesive compositions of the present invention are useful for pressure sensitive labels and decals. A wide variety of materials are useful as label and decal stocks and any paper or film material with suitable printability, cuttability, stiffness and adhesive coatability is satisfactory. Typical label and decal stocks include paper, polyolefin films including polyethylene, polypropylene and ethylene-propylene copolymers, polyester films, plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) films, and the like. Plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) films are especially preferred as a decal stock.",
