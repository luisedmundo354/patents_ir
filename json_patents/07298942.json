        "The invention relates to optical couplers and particularly to such devices that couple optoelectronic elements and optical fiber. More particularly, the invention relates to couplers having lenses.",
        "Several patent documents may be related to optical coupling between optoelectronic elements and optical media. They include U.S. Pat. No. 6,086,263 by Selli et al., issued Jul. 11, 2000, entitled \u201cActive Device Receptacle\u201d and owned by the assignee of the present application; U.S. Pat. No. 6,302,596 B1 by Cohen et al., issued Oct. 16, 2001, and entitled \u201cSmall Form Factor Optoelectronic Receivers\u201d; U.S. Pat. No. 5,692,083 by Bennet, issued Nov. 25, 1997, and entitled \u201cIn-Line Unitary Optical Device Mount and Package therefore\u201d; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,536,959 B2, by Kuhn et al., issued Mar. 25, 2003, and entitled \u201cCoupling Configuration for Connecting an Optical Fiber to an Optoelectronic Component\u201d; which are herein incorporated by reference.",
        "In the context of the invention, the optoelectronic element may be understood as being a transmitter or a receiver. When electrically driven, the optoelectronic element in the form of a transmitter or light source converts the electrical signals into optical signals that are transmitted as light signals. On receiving optical signals, the optoelectronic element in the form of a receiver or detector converts these signals into corresponding electrical signals that can be tapped off at the output. In addition, an optical fiber may be understood to be any apparatus for forwarding an optical signal with spatial limitation, in particular preformed optical fibers and so-called waveguides.",
        "A problem with couplers may involve light reflected back to the light source. This may be an issue because, for instance, some fiber optic transmitters suffer from undesirable and performance degrading reflections from the face end of the optical fiber back into the coupled optoelectronic element device (e.g., a semiconductor laser). Here, the fiber's surface and facing surface of the optoelectronic element device form a Fabry-Perot cavity which may modulate the light from the laser transmitter or semiconductor laser and consequently produce unwanted fluctuations in the power coupled to the optical fiber. Further, the optical energy reflected directly into the laser cavity may cause additional noise in the laser's output. For these reasons, it would be desirable to reduce and minimize the return reflections from the fiber face in the coupler.",
        "The invention is an optical coupler which may couple a light source or detector and optical fiber to each other. The coupler may have a fiber stop which is a lens. That is, the optical fiber may have an end that is in contact with a lens of the coupler.",
        "FIG. 1 is an optical diagram of a two ball lens coupler having an air gap between the optical fiber end and the nearest lens.",
        "FIG. 2 is a diagram of a two ball lens coupler having a fiber stop lens.",
        "FIG. 3 is a diagram of a one and a half lens couple having a flat lens surface as a fiber stop.",
        "FIG. 4 is a side sectional view of a two-ball lens coupler apparatus implementing the coupler of FIG. 1;",
        "FIG. 5 is a side sectional view of a two-ball lens coupler apparatus implementing the coupler of FIG. 2;",
        "FIG. 6 is a side sectional view of a one and a half ball lens coupler implementing the coupler of FIG. 3; and",
        "FIGS. 7a, 7b and 7c are a side view and perspective views, respectively, of the coupler housing hardware.",
        "FIG. 1 shows an optical layout of a two-ball lens optical coupler 30. This two-ball lens system may be arranged to focus the light at a point outside the second ball lens 29, possibly often with light 14 nearly perfectly collimated between ball lenses 28 and 29. Light 14 may be emitted by a light source 11. Source 11 may be a laser such as a vertical cavity surface emitting laser. Light 14 may propagate through ball lens 28 and 29. Light 14 may be focused by lens 28 and 29 on end face 22 of core 23 of optical fiber 33. Light 14 may propagate from ball lens 29 through air onto the end of core 23. The Fresnel coefficient of back reflectance 31 of light 14 for coupler 30 may be determined with the following formula, where \u201cn\u201d is an index of refraction of light of the subject material,\n\n((nlens glass\u2212nair)/(nlens glass+nair))2.\n\nCalculation of reflected light 31 may amount to about 4 percent of the originally emitted light 14 for an nlens glass=1.5 and nair=1.0. This amount of back reflectance light 31 is significant enough to cause unwanted fluctuations in power of light 14 from source 11 coupled to core 23 of optical fiber 33 at end face 22 and additional noise in light 14 at the output of light source 11.",
        "FIG. 2 shows an optical layout of a two-ball optical coupler 10. Light 14 may be emanated by source 11. Light 14 may propagate through ball lens 15 and into ball lens 16, respectively. Ball lens 16 may focus light 14 down to a spot at or near the surface of lens 16 where light 14 may exit lens 16. Core 23 of fiber 33 may have end face 22 that is situated against the surface of ball lens 16 at that spot where the rays of light 14 converge together. This arrangement may minimize reflectance of light 14 into light 32 that moves towards the direction of light source 11. One cause of reflected light 32 may be at end face 22 of fiber core 23 being coupled. A reduction of reflectance light 32 may result from having end face 22 of core 23 of fiber 33 of coupler 10 physically in contact with a lens, such as ball lens 16. The reduction of reflected light 32 may occur because an air interface between lens 16 and fiber end 22 is eliminated at the point of contact. The Fresnel coefficient of back reflectance 32 of light 14, in view of coupler 10, may be determined with the following formula,\n\n((nlens glass\u2212nglass fiber)/(nlens glass+nglass fiber))2.\n\nCalculation of reflected light 32 may amount to about 0.01 percent of light 14 for an nglass fiber=1.47 and nlens glass=1.5. This calculated amount of reflected light 32 in coupler 10 is about 0.25 percent of the calculated reflected light 31 in coupler 30.",
        "FIG. 3 shows an optical layout of a one and a half-ball optical coupler 20. Light 14 may be emitted by light source 11. Light 14 may propagate through ball lens 25 and into a half-ball lens 26. Half-ball lens 26 may focus light 14 down to a spot at or near the flat surface of lens 26 where light 14 may exit lens 26. Core 23 of fiber 33 may have an end 22 that is situated against the flat surface of ball lens 26 at that spot where the rays of light 14 converge together. This arrangement may minimize reflectance of light 14 as light 34 propagating towards the direction of light source 11. One cause of reflection may be at end face 22 of fiber core 23 being coupled. A reduction of reflectance light 34 may result from having end face 22 of core 23 of fiber 33 of coupler 10 physically in contact with half-ball lens 26. The reduction of reflected light 34 may occur because the air interface between lens 26 and fiber end 22 is eliminated with the point of contact. The Fresnel coefficient of back reflectance 34 of light 14, in view of coupler 20, may be determined with the following applicable formula,\n\n((nlens glass\u2212nglass fiber)/(nlens glass+nglass fiber))2.\n\nCalculation of reflected light 34 may amount to about 0.01 percent of light 14 for an nglass fiber=1.47 and nlens glass=1.5. This calculated amount of reflected light 34 in coupler 20 is about 0.25 percent of the calculated reflected light 31 in coupler 30. The closeness of the indices of refraction of the glass fiber and lens glass appears to result in a minimizing of light reflected from the fiber core end face. The composition of ball lenses 15, 16, 25, 26, 28 and 29 may include BK7\u2122 glass or like material.",
        "The following table indicates the amount of reflected light which is indicated in terms of a percentage of light to the end of the optical medium such as a fiber end face relative to the indices of refraction of the lens proximate to the optical medium and of the optical medium. The formula used for the table is\n\n((nlens glass\u2212nmedium)/(nlens glass+nmedium))2.",
        "nlens glass\nnmedium\n% of Reflected Light\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.50\n1.00\n4.00\n\n\n1.50\n1.10\n2.37\n\n\n1.50\n1.20\n1.23\n\n\n1.50\n1.30\n0.510\n\n\n1.50\n1.35\n0.277\n\n\n1.50\n1.40\n0.119\n\n\n1.50\n1.41\n0.0957\n\n\n1.50\n1.42\n0.0751\n\n\n1.50\n1.425\n0.0657\n\n\n1.50\n1.43\n0.0571\n\n\n1.50\n1.44\n0.0416\n\n\n1.50\n1.45\n0.0287\n\n\n1.50\n1.46\n0.0183\n\n\n1.50\n1.47\n0.0120\n\n\n1.50\n1.48\n0.00450\n\n\n1.50\n1.49\n0.00112",
        "If the medium has an index of refraction 10 percent lower than that of the lens, the light reflected is about 0.277 percent of the light going to the medium, which is about 7 percent of light reflected with air as an intervening medium between the lens and the optical medium. If the medium has an index of refraction 5 percent lower than that of the lens, the light reflected is about 0.0657 percent of the light going to the medium, which is about 1.6 percent of light reflected with air as an intervening medium between the lens and the optical medium. In the table, the medium may be the intervening medium. However, if there is contact between the lens and the optical medium the calculation may apply to the index of refraction of the optical medium. Hence, while this discussion has shown that the optimum implementation of this invention includes matching the fiber stop optical element's index of refraction to that of the fiber, significant practical performance gain (i.e., reduction of reflectance feedback) is accomplished even in imperfectly index matched implementations.",
        "FIG. 4 shows an example of coupler 30. This coupler may be a two ball lens system having an optical fiber 33 interface with a space 35 between the nearest ball lens 29 and fiber face 22. Space 35 may be a vacuum or filled with air or other optical medium material. Coupler 30 may have a laser light source 11, such as a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). Source 11 may be contained in a hermetically sealed package 12 having a window 13. Source 11 may emit light 14 through window 13, ball lenses 28 and 29. Lenses 28 and 29 may be structurally supported by an optical subassembly housing 17. Housing 17 may be structurally supported by fiber optic coupler barrel 18. Package 12 may be situated in a z-alignment sleeve 19. Package 12, for example, may be a TO-56 can. Barrel 18 and sleeve 19 may be fabricated from a stainless metal alloy. The materials of these components, including housing 17, may be thermally matched. Housing 17 may be of a ceramic such as zirconia or of a metal. Sleeve 19 may be fit into barrel 18 and slide back and forth in order to adjust the distance of source 11 from ball lens 28.",
        "After the accomplishment of distance adjustment between source 11 and lens 28, then sleeve 19 may be fixed or secured to barrel 18 with a weld spot, pressed fit, glue, or the like. A ferrule 24 having an optical fiber 33 in it may be inserted into opening 21. An end face 22 of fiber 33 may be at a certain distance from ball lens 29, with air or another medium between end face 22 and ball lens 29. The other medium between end face 22 and ball lens 29 may be a light transmitting optical medium having a preferred index of refraction. The index of refraction may match the index of fiber core 23 or lens 29, or both of the latter. The distances of the ball lens 29 from fiber end face 22 and ball lens 28 and of ball lens 28 from light source 11 may be adjusted for another optical medium between ball lens 29 and end face 22.",
        "Couplers 10, 20 and 30 may be designed to operate at 850 nm, 1310 nm or 1550 nm. They may instead be designed for some other wavelength. These couplers may be designed in various configurations such as with one lens, molded lens or lenses, or more than two lenses.",
        "FIG. 5 shows an illustrative implementation of coupler 10. The structure of coupler 10 may be similar to that of coupler 30 except that ball lens 16, which is the lens closest to fiber end face 22, may be a fiber stop for fiber 33 and its core 23. Coupler 10 may have a lens arrangement, which includes a ball lens 15 near source 11, has the light focused at or slightly inside the second ball lens 16 surface so that the source 11 to fiber 33 ray path may be much different than that of coupler 30. Fiber 33 being coupled to may be arranged in such a manner that it is in physical contact with the surface of the second ball lens 16. The components of coupler 10 may be held in place by an external housing fabricated in such a manner that the laser diode, optical elements and receiving optical fiber cable are held in the correct positions to effect the above-noted focusing.",
        "FIG. 6 shows an illustrative implementation of coupler 20. System 20 may involve a use of a half-ball lens 26 in the system. In this two element full ball-half ball design, the fiber-to-lens contact is thus planar instead of a single point of contact as in the two-ball lens approach of system 10. The half-ball lens configuration may have the advantages of loosened radial alignment tolerances and reduced contact pressure which may make fiber end face 22 and fiber stop lens 26 less prone to wear or potential surface damage upon repeated insertions of ferrule 24. Ferrule 24 may be fabricated from a ceramic such as zirconia or form another material. End face 22 of core 23 may be a polished round surfaced tip having a relatively large radius or be flat. There may be a ball lens 25 between lens 26 and source 11. Fiber 33 may be single mode but could be multi-mode as desired. Likewise, light source 11 may be single mode but could be multi-mode.",
        "FIG. 7a shows an external side view of couplers 10, 20 and 30, without ferrule 24 inserted, shown in FIGS. 4-6. FIGS. 7b and 7c are perspective views of these couplers.",
        "A multitude of the optical couplers may be incorporated in an array-arrangement. Such arrangement may be of a one or two dimensional layout.",
        "Although the invention has been described with respect to at least one illustrative embodiment, many variations and modifications, including aspheric lens variations, modifications and substitutions, will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the present specification. It is therefore the intention that the appended claims be interpreted as broadly as possible in view of the prior art to include all such variations and modifications."
