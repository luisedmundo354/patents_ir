    "description": [
        "This invention relates to a system and method for positively identifying individuals (i.e., citizens, customers, employees, patients, and subjects) at particular points of interest in the areas of health care (e.g., hospitals or doctor's offices), security (e.g., banks, airports, etc.), and any other situations where an individual's identity must be confirmed. This invention further relates to a database that contains individual biometric data along with commonly accessed identifying information about the individual. The additional identifying information is contained in another category of databases that manage information about individuals including, but not limited to, health care information, security issue information, and any other private information which an individual wants to protect.",
        "In today's society, it is becoming increasingly important for entities to accurately confirm the identity of individuals. This is made clear especially in three areas of challenge to current society: 1) the passage and maintenance of health care records; 2) the problem of identity theft to criminals and loss of control of identity in reference to other individuals or entities in society; and 3) security issues of national protection as required by certain functions (e.g., such as opening a bank account must now be monitored).",
        "In general, society currently relies on the confirmation of individuals through witnesses, identity cards, identity codes, and biometric identifiers. For example, a witness, (e.g., anyone from a casual acquaintance to a notary public) can confirm a person's identity. Also, identity cards and personal identification codes are utilized to authenticate an individual's identity. This system, however, is expensive and corruptible. Recognizing these deficiencies, attempts have been made to improve the situation.",
        "One example of a present identification system is a computer system that remotely records the arrival and departure times of field-based employees at various work sites through a telephone network. Specifically, the system detects an employee's automatic number identification data and further collects personal identification codes from the caller. The automatic number identification and personal identification code are used to identify the calling telephone. Once identified, the system can record the arrival and departure times of the employee.",
        "These systems have several disadvantages. First, automatic number identification (i.e. \u201cCaller ID\u201d) only indicates the telephone number of the particular telephone used to make the call. Automatic number identification information therefore does not affirmatively confirm the identity of an individual\u2014only the location from which the individual is placing a telephone call. Similarly, personal identification codes are manually entered into a keypad by any individual and are therefore not reliable for confirming the identity of an individual. More specifically, mere receipt of a manually entered personal identification code does not assure that the person entering the personal identification code is the person assigned to the personal identification code.",
        "Because these above systems are expensive, time consuming, or subject to misuse and abuse, biometric devices were created for use in identification and authorization. Generally, measurable and recordable body features (e.g., fingerprints, eye patterns, facial contours, or voice characteristics, etc.) are registered as biometric keys and, at the time of authentication, compared with the respective body features of a person to be authenticated.",
        "A personal computer (\u201cPC\u201d) can be equipped with a device (e.g., a video camera) that makes it possible for the PC to record biometric information (e.g., facial features) and to reuse the information at a later time for authenticating an individual. The PC could grant access to a user only if it confirms the identity of the user by recognizing his or her facial features.",
        "In any event, the above identification systems are currently used only on an ad hoc basis and are not connected to any national database. Furthermore, if a national database were implemented according to today's technology, the holder of the end data would not only have the individual's acquired data, but also the individual's unique identification information. Such systems do not protect the individual from fraud and abuse. Such systems cannot be currently regulated by US law to protect the identity of the individual from being passed to other entities. Over time the independence of the individual would be lost. In addition, they are also subject to fraud and abuse if implemented without a secured input device.",
        "There currently exists a need for a national or international system that would allow authentication of an individual at any given time and location while at the same time protecting the individual from loss of identity. On 27 Apr. 2004, President Bush called for the majority of Americans to have interoperable electronic health records within ten years. David J. Brailer, M.D., Ph.D., National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, released his report, \u201cThe Decade of Health Information Technology: Delivering Consumer-centric and Information-rich Health Care,\u201d on 21 Jul. 2004. In the report he calls for four goals in the strategic framework: 1) Informed Clinical Practice; 2) Interconnected Clinicians; 3) Personalized Care; and 4) Improved Population Health.",
        "\u201cThe Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Interrupt and Obstruct Terrorism\u201d (USA Patriot Act) Act of 2001 (H.R. 3162-24 Oct. 2001) requires, among other things, the identification and verification by all financial institutions of accountholders and prospective accountholders (See, \u00a7326). Not only must an accountholder be identified and verified, records related to the accountholder, at a minimum name, address and other identifying information, must be maintained. In other words, a secure database is required.",
        "Databases have been utilized for a number of years to store, sort and distribute information. Specifically, in the medical field, databases have been utilized to diagnose and treat patient diseases. David Bennahum illustrates the long known need for medical interconnectivity in an article entitled \u201cDocs for Docs\u201d in Wired Magazine in June 1995. He notes that doctors have been attempting to create a \u201cvirtual patient record\u201d for years. Essentially, with the emergence of more efficient wireless networks, it was possible to link doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, and drug labs. As a result, doctors were able to record instructions, maintain medical information and receive general medical information from insurance companies and drug labs over a wireless network connecting several databases. Unfortunately, the system of interconnectivity has never occurred because the current system of authentication and security of the information electronically can not be secured in a timely, inexpensive manner that will not allow the possibility of identity loss.",
        "There exists a need for a system that positively authenticates an individual and that is connected to a database for immediate retrieval of an individual's medical information. More specifically, patients visiting such places as doctor's offices, dentist's offices and hospitals often need to complete forms they have completed in the past. A system that positively identifies an individual and that retrieves all pertinent information about the individual (e.g., name, insurance carrier, etc.) is greatly desired provided identity loss cannot occur.",
        "There exists a need for a secured system that allows an employee, client, patient, subject or citizen to interface with an organization, business, individual, or government agency when a positive identification for a form to be completed is required. Such form collections, authorizations, verifications and organization are increasingly costly and difficult to manage in a secure fashion. As more and more human abstract thought and information leaves the confines of the visible universe and enters the electronic \u201cfifth dimension\u201d in an ever growing world that occupies neither space nor time, where information about every individual can, as an electron around an atom, be every where and no where at the same time, it is important in the preservation of liberty that each individual's fifth dimension of abstract thought and information be protected and preserved as his or her own.",
        "The present invention relates generally to a system of authentication and a means for retrieving information about the authenticated individual. More specifically, it allows a person to execute forms (e.g., consent forms) at any location across the world by submitting to a positive identification test. In turn, doctors and medical researchers can, for example, receive all pertinent information associated with the authenticated individual (e.g., medical history, allergies, consent forms, etc.).",
        "The present invention relates to an inexpensive and secure system that can positively authenticate an individual and retrieve pertinent information regarding that individual while leaving his or her fifth dimension of abstract knowledge and information secured. The present invention further allows an entity to interact with the general population to retrieve, process, and organize secured completed forms in a way that allow centralization of information while protecting the autonomy of the individual.",
        "An object of the present invention is to provide a system to allow an employee, client, patient, subject, or citizen to interface with an organization, business, individual, or government agency when a positive identification for a form to be completed is required. Another object of the present invention is to provide assured confirmation of an individual via a secure, tamper-proof system.",
        "Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a system that can transmit its location when accessed to confirm the identity of the active user.",
        "Yet another object of the present invention is to allow any entity (e.g., organization, business, individual, or government agency) that requires an individual to complete a form to ensure that the forms are properly signed and the identity of the signatory is verified.",
        "Yet another object of the present invention is to allow any equipped entity (having the permission and verification of an individual) to access the individual's pertinent information, including all forms completed by the individual.",
        "Another object of the present invention is to allow an individual to alter his or her pertinent information from a properly equipped personal computer.",
        "Yet another object of the present invention is to allow an individual to fill out pertinent forms (i.e. agreements, authorizations, contracts, records, and transactions) at a convenient time and place.",
        "Yet another object of the present invention is to allow communication of an individual's secured information from one Electronic Identification System's Biometrically Endorsed Repository Grid (\u201cEISBERG\u201d) to another, if he or she so chooses. If this decision is not made by the individual, then no communication may be made from an EISBERG with any other entity.",
        "Other objects, features, and characteristics of the present invention, as well as the methods of operation and functions of the related elements of the structure, and the combination of parts and economies of manufacture, will become more apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description with reference to the accompanying drawings, all of which form a part of this specification.",

The following presents a detailed description of a preferred embodiment (as well as some alternative embodiments) of the present invention.",
        "Referring first to FIGS. 1 and 2, an overview of the preferred embodiment of the present invention is depicted at the point of access by an individual. More specifically, the Electronic Identification System for Form Location, Organization and Endorsement (\u201cEISFLOE\u201d) 6 is shown, generally comprising three components: the point-of-access by a user of the system in EIS House 1, Electronic Identification System's Comprehensive Authentication Process (\u201cEISCAP\u201d) 3, and Electronic Identification System's Biometrically Endorsed Repository Grid (\u201cEISBERG\u201d) 5, each of which will be described in more detail below.",
        "EIS House 1 serves as the site where the user elects to authenticate a form. The meaning of \u201cform,\u201d includes but is not limited to, agreements, authorizations, contracts, records, and transactions relating to all aspects of the Automated Numerical Identifier Network (\u201cANI Network\u201d) (as defined below). A form may embody a physical document or alternatively an electronic document (e.g., a fillable internet webpage). Internet Access Device (\u201cIAD\u201d) 7 (e.g., a computer terminal) and EIS Machine 13 interact within EIS House 1. Importantly, EIS Machine 13 receives no electronic data input. Through communication line 17, EIS Machine 13 interfaces with IAD 7 when called upon by EISBERG 5, requesting that the individual enter his or her electronic identity into EIS Machine 13. Once the individual activates EIS Machine 13, the electronic message is attached to a web page in IAD 7 and sent through communication line 9 to EISBERG 5. Simultaneously EIS Machine 13 sends the electronic identity out of EIS House 1 to EISCAP 3 through communication line 15, as noted below, which is discussed in greater detail below.",
        "Generally, a user of the system of the present invention wishes to authorize a specific form (e.g., consent form, tissue donation authorization form, do not resuscitate form, etc.) and accesses the system of the present invention at EIS House 1, via IAD 7. The information regarding the specific form can be collected in any manner as described in greater detail below. Initially, IAD 7 transmits information regarding the requested form over communication line 9 to EISBERG 5. In response, EISBERG 5 retrieves the requested form from an internal storage area (e.g., database) and transmits the corresponding form information over communication line 11 to IAD 7. The user utilizes an interface device, such as a terminal, at EIS House 1 to supply the information required by the form and utilizes EIS Machine 13 to initiate authentication of the form. Generally, EIS Machine 13 transfers an electronic code along with the form from IAD 7 to EISBERG 5 while simultaneously transferring a coded signal containing a user's biometric and identification information over communication line 15 to EISCAP 3.",
        "As described above, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention an individual requests a form (e.g., a web page form) via IAD 7. IAD 7 can comprise any computer means connected to EIS Machine 13 that is equipped with the proper identification peripherals as described in greater detail below.",
        "Although all communication lines are depicted as physically connected communication means, it is contemplated that all communication within the system of the present invention can be completed by any method of information transfer, including but not limited to telephone trunk lines, T1 data lines, and wireless communication means.",
        "Generally, as shown in FIG. 1, EIS House 1 includes Internet Access Device (\u201cIAD\u201d) 7 and EIS Machine 13 and may be located anywhere in the world. EIS Machine 13 provides a secured means for an individual to interface with an organization, business, individual, or government agency when a positive identification for a form to be completed is required. Because EIS Machine 13 is tamper-proof and will transmit its location when accessed, the active participation of the person being identified (i.e., the user) can be assured.",
        "EIS Machine 13 is registered with EISFLOE system 6 and is assigned a unique identification code to confirm access when transmitting information to EISCAP 3 or EISBERG 5. To access EISFLOE 6, an individual who wishes to consider authorizing a form accesses IAD 7 by utilizing an interface (i.e., a terminal) in EIS House 1. The user can enter information to indicate the desired form through any known means of collecting information, including, but not limited to, digital scan and keyboard means. EIS Machine 13 is capable of interfacing with IAD 7 in transmitting the response to a form that requires authentication over communication line 17 via IAD 7 to EISBERG 5 over communication line 9.",
        "EIS machine 13 also collects a user's identification information, which can be in the form of a number or other data. In the preferred embodiment, a user's identification information is the user's Social Security Number, but in alternative embodiments, a user's identification information may comprise a unique number assigned to the user or any other information that serves to uniquely identify the user (e.g., passport number, etc.). In addition, EIS machine 13 may collect a user's biometric information (e.g., digital picture, fingerprint, signature, DNA, etc.). Preferably, EIS Machine 13 is capable of transmitting a user's biometric information to EISCAP 3 over communication line 15. In the preferred embodiment, EIS machine 13 is incapable of receiving any electronically transmitted information.",
        "While transferring the user's identification and biometric information to EISCAP 3, EIS Machine 13 authorizes IAD 7 to transmit the completed form to EISBERG 5 via communication line 9. EISBERG 5 then awaits authentication from EISCAP 3 via communication line 4. Once EISCAP 3 verifies the identity of the user, it communicates back to EISBERG 5 via communication line 2. The signal that the form has been successfully completed is then sent via communication line 11.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 2, the system and method of authenticating the user via EISCAP 3 is shown. This is where the individual is judged to be authentic. Generally, EISCAP 3 is the system of connections between databases containing user identification numbers, biometric information, and other identifiers (both biometric and non-biometric). More specifically, EISCAP Server 21 receives the identification and biometric information from EIS Machine 13 via communication line 15. Additional information, such as the location of EIS Machine 13 (sent by Global Positioning System (\u201cGPS\u201d) 23) and the time of access (sent by atomic clock 25) are recorded in EISCAP Server 21 with the biometric and identification information sent from EIS Machine 13. This grouping of information serves to uniquely identify the transaction and is assigned tracking number 27. The grouping of information (\u201cEISCUBE\u201d 29) is sent to EISBERG Server 41 via communication line 31, as depicted in FIG. 3. In such a way, EISCAP 3 verifies the identity of the user of EIS Machine 13 in an accurate manner.",
        "In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, EISCAP 3 further comprises security monitoring system 33 that tracks the input of information over communication line 15, GPS 23, and atomic clock 25. EISCAP 3 records the transfer of information between EIS Machine 13 and EISCAP 3 in EISCAP database 35. Security monitoring system 33 further recognizes any irregular information and isolates any potential errors for review. By recording potential errors in EISCAP database 35, security monitoring system 33 ensures that EISCAP 3 can provide accurate authentication information in a secure manner.",
        "Referring next to FIG. 3, EISBERG 5 performs the function of managing the forms that require authentication. For example, EISBERG 5 contains a plurality of forms (e.g., consent forms for treatment, do not resuscitate forms, etc.) that require an individual's consent for execution. Different EISBERGs can be connected to EISFLOE system 6 based on desired function. For example, different EISBERGs can include: (1) Tissue Donation/Consent for Cancer Research (or other medical illness research); (2) Medical Outcome Data Consent Form; (3) Medical Procedure Consent Form; (4) HIPAA compliance in medical offices, clinics, hospitals, etc.; (5) Insurance fraud prevention; (6) Sign-in system for employees/customers; (7) Verification for services rendered at a given time and place; and (8) Organ Donation for state non-profit organ donation organizations for organ procurement.",
        "As shown, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, EISBERG 5 comprises EISBERG Server 41 for sending and receiving information via communication lines 2, 4, 9, and 11. Generally, as described in greater detail with respect to FIG. 1, EISBERG 5 receives information from IAD 7 corresponding to the form requested by the user and transmits the requested form to IAD 7 via communication line 11. Once the user completes the form using the inputs at EIS Machine 13, IAD 7 transmits the completed form to EISBERG Server 41 to await authentication. Authentication occurs when EISBERG Server 41 communicates with EISCAP Server 21 via communication line 4. Then as also described in greater detail with respect to FIG. 2, EISBERG 5 receives information from EISCAP 3 (i.e., EISCUBE 29) verifying the identity of the user.",
        "More specifically, EISBERG Server 41 receives and stores completed form information provided by IAD 7 over communication line 9. EISBERG Server 41 further receives and stores EISCUBE 29 from EISCAP 3 over communication line 2.",
        "EISBERG Server 41 reviews EISCUBE 29 to ensure that the user has agreed to the content in the form transmitted to EISBERG 5 from IAD 7. Once EISCUBE 29 is verified, EISBERG Server 41 matches EISCUBE 29 with the completed form sent to EISBERG 5 by IAD 7 and attaches EISCUBE 29 to the completed form to create a verified form. This verified form may then be retrieved at IAD 7 for internal use in EIS House 1 via communication line 11.",
        "It should be noted that signature information and photographic information can be collected-at EIS Machine 13 and utilized in the verification process in EISCAP 5. Such signature and photographic information could be included in EISCUBE 29 and attached as part of the verified form in EISBERG 5. All information received by EISBERG 5 (typically confidential or individual-sensitive information) remains within EISBERG Server 41 and can be used only in accordance with the agreement made with the individual. Such information is not transmitted to EISCAP 3.",
        "There is also a security program that runs at the EISCAP 3 for monitoring the system of EIS Machines and EISBERGs.",
        "Referring next to FIG. 4, shown is EISCUBE 29 utilized for authentication of the user at EIS Machine 13. Specifically, EISCUBE 29 contains information such that the individual user can be positively authenticated. EISCUBE 29 is attached to a verified form to indicate that the form has been authenticated. Although EISCUBE 29 can comprise any number of personal identifiers, in the preferred embodiment depicted in FIG. 4, EISCUBE 29 comprises user name 51, user signature 53, tracking number code 27, grid coordinates 55, and date and time of transaction 57. EISBERG 5 attaches EISCUBE 29 to the proper form as a symbol to the EISFLOW system that the user has been authenticated and verified the information contained in the form.",
