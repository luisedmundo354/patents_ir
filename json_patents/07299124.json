Then the input value is stored in a input value storage buffer. When an application program is acquired, an input value acquisition processing is initiated, the input value is from the buffer, and is transferred to the application program. When the application program is set, an output value updating is initiated, the output value having been transferred from the application program is updated, and the result is stored in an output value storage buffer. Further, output processing means is initiated in response to the timing preset on the initiation table and an output value is outputted from the output value storage buffer.",
