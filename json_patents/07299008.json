        "1. Field of Invention",
        "The present invention relates generally to wireless communication services and, more particularly, to a system and method for servicing multiple wireless communication devices in a personal area network.",
        "2. Copyright & Trademark Notices",
        "A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material, which is subject to copyright protection. The owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by any one of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyrights whatsoever.",
        "Certain marks referenced herein may be common law or registered trademarks of third parties affiliated or unaffiliated with the applicant or the assignee. Use of these marks is for providing an enabling disclosure by way of example and shall not be construed to limit the scope of this invention to material associated with such marks.",
        "3. Related Art",
        "Wireless communication technology and wireless communication devices continue to grow in popularity as the related systems and accessories become more affordable and easier to use. A recent trend in wireless communication involves implementation of personal area networks (PAN) for connecting ordinary household items to each other, using efficient and cost-effective wireless technologies such as Bluetooth\u2122 or Wi-Fi\u2122.",
        "For example, some recently developed wireless mobile communication devices (e.g., Sony Ericsson P800, 3G Motorola A830, Siemens S55, Nokia 6310i) include a Bluetooth interface that enables the device to wirelessly communicate with another system, such as a hands free car kit. For the communication to be successful, the hands free car kit will need to include a wireless communication port compatible with the Bluetooth technology used in the mobile phone. Further, the car kit and the mobile phone need to go through a one-time initial pairing process to establish the appropriate communication settings.",
        "Thereafter, the mobile phone and the car kit can wirelessly communicate as soon as the two devices are located within a proximate communication range. Thus, a user can seamlessly use the hands free and other features of the car kit without having to plug the mobile phone into a particular wire or cradle. Even more conveniently, the user need not even remove his or her mobile phone from his briefcase, purse or trunk of the car, so long as the mobile phone and the car kit remain within a reasonable communication distance.",
        "Several disadvantages, however, are associated with the current systems. For example, the currently implemented car kit can communicate only with the mobile phone with which it is paired. That is, if a second mobile phone is within the communication range of the car kit, the car kit will not be able to service the second phone. To overcome this problem, a user must pair the second mobile phone with the car kit. This task is inconvenient, however. Besides, by pairing the second phone, the communication interface between the first phone and the car kit will become unavailable.",
        "It would be very useful if the current car kit systems could be improved to service more than one mobile phone at all times.",
        "The present disclosure is directed to a system and corresponding methods for enabling a call management device to service more than one wireless mobile communication device in a wireless personal communications network (PAN). To accomplish this, in accordance with one or more embodiments, the call management device is designated as the primary (i.e., master) device in the network, and the mobile communication devices are designated as the corresponding non-primary (i.e., slave) devices. Alternatively, a plurality of separate networks may be implemented, wherein each of the respective mobile communication devices are designated as the primary device in each network, and the call management device is designated as the non-primary device in each network.",
        "For purposes of summarizing, certain aspects, advantages, and novel features of the invention have been described herein. It is to be understood that not necessarily all such advantages may be achieved in accordance with any one particular embodiment of the invention. Thus, the invention may be embodied or carried out in a manner that achieves or optimizes one advantage or group of advantages as taught herein without necessarily achieving other advantages as may be taught or suggested.",

The method comprises implementing an association between the call management device and each of the plurality of mobile communication devices; configuring the call management device as a primary device in a personal area network (PAN); and configuring each of the plurality of the mobile communication devices as a non-primary device in the PAN.",
        "The implementing process comprises creating a list of the associations between the call management device and each of the plurality of mobile communication devices. The list is stored in a memory of the call management device. In one embodiment, the PAN is a piconet for connecting the call management device to each of the plurality of mobile communication devices using Bluetooth communication technology. The call management device can be a hands-free car kit.",
        "In certain embodiments, a method for establishing a wireless communication interface between a call management device and a plurality of mobile communication devices, comprises implementing an association between the call management device and each of the plurality of mobile communication devices; configuring each of the plurality of the mobile communication devices, respectively, as a primary device in a corresponding personal area network (PAN); and configuring the call management device as a non-primary device in each of the corresponding PANs.",
        "The implementing process comprises creating a list of the associations between the call management device and each of the plurality of mobile communication devices, wherein the list is stored in a memory of the call management device. Each of the corresponding PANs is a piconet for connecting the call management device to a respective one of the plurality of mobile communication devices in a scatternet, using Bluetooth communication technology.",
        "In accordance with one or more embodiments, a vehicle-mount call management system is connected to N wireless mobile communication devices in a personal area network (PAN), wherein the call management system is configured as a primary device and each of the N wireless mobile communication devices is configured as a non-primary device in the PAN, wherein the call management system services requests submitted by each of the N wireless mobile communication devices.",
        "The call management system is connected to the N wireless mobile communication devices in a piconet using Bluetooth technology, for example. The call management system can comprise a hands-free car kit having a list of associations, each association respectively identifying a corresponding mobile communication device in the PAN.",
        "In accordance with another embodiment, a vehicle-mount call management system is connected to N wireless mobile communication devices in N personal area network (PAN), wherein the call management system is configured as a non-primary device in each of the N PANs, and each of the N wireless mobile communication devices is configured as an a primary device in each of the N PANs, wherein an nth mobile communication device services requests submitted by the call management system in an nth PAN.",

        "Referring to FIG. 1, in one or more embodiments of the present invention, Bluetooth technology is applied as a means of wireless communication between a call management device 110 and a plurality of wireless mobile communication devices 120, 130. This application, however, is by way of example. As such, other wireless communication technologies suited for connecting wireless devices in short-range area networks, such as IEEE 802.11 and the like may be utilized. The terms \u201cconnected,\u201d \u201ccoupled,\u201d or any variant thereof, mean any connection or coupling, either direct or indirect, between two or more elements. The coupling or connection between the elements can be physical, logical, or a combination thereof.",
        "One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the communication network of the present invention may advantageously be comprised of one or a combination of various types of networks without detracting from the scope of the invention. Such networks in addition to a PAN can, for example, comprise local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), public, private or secure networks, value-added networks, interactive television networks, two-way cable networks, satellite networks, interactive kiosk networks, cellular communications networks, personal mobile gateways (PMGs) and/or any other suitable communications network.",
        "In certain embodiments, application software is executed on mobile devices 120, 130 to act as client software that is in communication with server software executed on call management device 110. In such an embodiment, mobile devices 120, 130 are configured as non-primary (slave) devices and call management device 110 is configured as the primary (master) device, for example.",
        "In an alternative embodiment, the application software executed on call management device 110 acts as client software that is in communication with server software executed on mobile devices 120, 130. In such an embodiment, mobile devices 120, 130 are configured as primary (master) devices and call management device is configured as the non-primary (slave) device.",
        "In one embodiment, mobile devices 120, 130 may comprise a PMG device or communicate with a PMG device in the call management device 110. The PMG architecture comprises a PMG server that can wirelessly communicate with a number of PMG enabled devices within the personal area of the user or a PAN. A more detailed description of the PMG architecture is provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/850,399, filed on May 7, 2001, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference here.",
        "As used herein, the terms wireless mobile communication device, call management system and communication network are to be viewed as designations of one or more computing environments that comprise application, client or server software for servicing requests submitted by respective software included in devices or other computing systems connected thereto. These terms are not to be otherwise limiting in any manner. The application software, for example, may be comprised of one or more modules that execute on one or more computing systems, as provided in further detail below.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1A, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, call management system 110 (i.e., a vehicle mountable hands free car kit) and mobile devices 120, 130 (i.e., handheld wireless cellular phones) are connected in a PAN A (i.e., a piconet), when either mobile device 120 or 130 enters a specific range in the proximity of call management device 110.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2, for a connection to be properly established, an association is implemented between each mobile device 120, 130 and call management device 110 (S210). Implementing an association comprises a pairing process after which mobile devices 120, 130 and call management device 110 can securely communicate with each other. When two devices are paired, the devices are synchronized on one or more respective frequency sequences to receive signals from other paired devices at predetermined clocked time periods.",
        "The association process provides for a secure communication environment, where devices can communicate with each other without interfering with other communications in nearby frequency ranges. For additional privacy and security, encryption can be applied to the data carried in the signals communicated between the devices. Thus, in certain embodiments, when the associations are implemented, encryption/decryption keys are also exchanged between the corresponding devices.",
        "Each of the implemented associations is stored as an entry in an association list (S220). The association list may be stored in a storage unit (i.e., memory) of call management device 110, or alternatively in one or more storage units in mobile devices 120 or 130. Based on the entries in the association list, call management device 110 can identify a mobile device entering the range of PAN A.",
        "In some embodiments, call management device 110 is configured as the primary device in the PAN (S230). As the primary device, call management device 110 dictates the frequency range on which other devices in PAN A can communicate. Depending on the type of the communication technology utilized, call management device 110 may also dictate the time frame of communication for each device in PAN A. As disclosed in further detail below, in some embodiments of the invention, call management device 110 also dictates a frequency hopping sequence which is followed by the other devices in PAN A, to minimize interference.",
        "In one embodiment, Mobile devices 120, 130 are configured as non-primary devices in PAN A (S240). A non-primary device follows the frequency range and communication time frame dictated by the primary device in the network. Accordingly, once call management device 110 and mobile devices 120, 130 are configured, PAN A is established allowing the devices to communicate.",
        "As long as at least one of mobile devices 120 or 130 is within the communication range of call management device 110, the two devices can communicate. If both mobile devices 120 and 130 are within the communication range of call management device 110, then call management device 110 recognizes both mobile devices 120 and 130 and services their requests.",
        "In certain embodiments, when mobile device 120 enters the respective service range, call management device 110 attempts to identify mobile device 120 before establishing a line of communication with it. To verify that mobile device 120 is an authorized device, call management device 110 receives a unique identifier communicated by mobile device 120. If call management device 110 can find a match between the unique identifier and one of the entries in the association list, then mobile device 120 is recognized as an authorized device. Otherwise, call management device 110 would not service any requests submitted by mobile device 120.",
        "Once mobile device 120 is recognized as an authorized device, then call management device 110 services mobile device 120's requests. In the event that another associated mobile device 130 enters the service range of call management device 110, the same recognition process is repeated. Since call management device 110 is the primary device, it dictates the communication frequency, time frame and frequency hopping spectrum for each of mobile devices 120 and 130, for example. As such, each mobile device 120, 130 in PAN A can communicate with call management device 110 without interference.",
        "In one embodiment of the invention, call management device 110 is a vehicle-mountable hands free kit and mobile device 120 is a handheld cellular phone equipped with a wireless interface. As such, when a user enters the communication range with his or her cell phone, the cell phone synchronizes with the hands free kit. The user can then use the hands free kit to make calls, receive calls, and carry on a conversation without having to pickup the cell phone, so long as the cell phone is associated with the hands free kit.",
        "In one or more embodiments, if a second hand held cellular phone enters the range of service, the hands free kit first attempts to determine if an association for the second hand held cellular phone exists in the association list. If so, then the second hand held cellular phone also synchronizes with the hands free kit and becomes part of PAN A, in which the hands free kit is configured to be the primary device and the first and second hand held phones are configured as non-primary devices (see FIGS. 1A, 2).",
        "When a voice call is received or initiated by the first cellular phone, the hands free kit does not service any voice calls for the second cellular phone. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the hands free kit prioritizes the calls according to a predetermined ordering mechanism (i.e., first-in/first-out queue). In this manner, once the hands free kit has completed servicing the voice session for the first cellular phone, it then services the voice session for the second cellular phone.",
        "Thus, in certain embodiments, once voice session is serviced at each instance. It is noteworthy, however, that while servicing a voice call for one phone, the hands free kit can, for example, let the user browse the phone book of the other phone, or access other features that are unrelated to the voice session. Certain embodiments of the invention can be configured to handle more than one voice session at a time. The user will have the option of switching between voice sessions by interacting with a user interface mechanism to, for example, put one voice session on hold to access another.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 1B and 3, according to another embodiment of the invention, after an association list is implemented (S310, S320), each mobile device 120, 130 is configured as a primary device (S330) and call management device is configured as a non-primary device (S340). According to this embodiment, two separate wireless communication networks PAN B and PAN C are implemented. PAN B comprises mobile device 130 as the primary device and call management device 110 as the non-primary device. PAN C comprises mobile device 120 as the primary device and call management device 110 as the non-primary device.",
        "In some embodiments, call management device 110 synchronizes with each of the mobile devices 120, 130, once each device is within the respective service range. Since in each network (i.e., PAN B and PAN C) mobile devices 120 and 130 are the respective primary devices, call management device 110 as the non-primary device in each network synchronizes with the frequency dictated by the respective mobile device 120 or 130. Communication interference is avoided by setting unique communication frequency, communication time frame, or frequency hopping spectrums, for example.",
        "As such, a single call management device 110 can be used to service requests submitted by a plurality of mobile devices 120, 130 configured as the primary device in a plurality of short-range wireless networks. In a certain preferred embodiment, the short-range wireless networks are implemented using Bluetooth technology.",
        "Bluetooth offers fast and reliable digital transmissions of both voice and data over the globally available, unlicensed, 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band. The Bluetooth technology comprises hardware, software and interoperability requirements ideal for the mobile environment. The ability of the technology to create ad hoc networks on the fly reduces connection delays, alleviate expensive hardware and wires, while permitting total connectivity at minimum cost.",
        "In some embodiments, a Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) allows Bluetooth devices to discover what services are available or to find a Bluetooth device that supports a specific service. Advantageously, embodiments of the present invention that implement a Bluetooth PAN are robust, less complex and capable of handling both data and voice transmission at the same time.",
        "To make the system of the invention as robust as possible, in one embodiment, the operating band is divided into 1 MHz-spaced channels, each signaling data at 1 Mb/s. This is achieved by using GFSK (Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying) modulation scheme, for example. Mobile devices 120, 130 tune their radios to a different frequency, effectively hopping from radio channel to radio channel; this is known as FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum).",
        "Thus, if a transmission is compromised by interference on one channel, the retransmission will be on a different channel. Each communication time slot can last approximately 625 \u03bcs (625 microseconds), for example, and generally each device has a hop rate of approximately 1600 hops/second.",
        "Depending on implementation (see FIGS. 1A, 1B), the primary device(s) set the frequency hoping sequence and the non-primary device(s) synchronize to the primary in time and frequency by following the primary devices' frequency hoping sequence. Each device 110, 120, 130 is associated with a unique Bluetooth device address and a 28-bit Bluetooth clock. The baseband part of the Bluetooth System uses a special algorithm, which calculates the frequency hop sequence from the primary devices' clock and device address. In addition to controlling the frequency hop sequence, the primary device controls when non-primary devices are to transmit using Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), in one or more embodiments.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 1A, 2, in an embodiment where call management device 110 is the primary device and mobile devices 120 and 130 are the non-primary devices, a piconet is formed, wherein all mobile devices follow the frequency hopping sequence of call management device 110. Mobile devices 120, 130 in the piconet have links to call management device 110 and no direct links to each other.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 1B, 3, in another embodiment, a plurality of piconets are formed, where call management device is configured as the non-primary device and each mobile device 120, 130 is configured as the primary. This combination of piconets is referred to as a scatternet.",
        "Due to the ad-hoc nature of a Bluetooth network, a plurality of mobile devices (120, 130, etc.) may come into and go out of range of service of call management device 110.
