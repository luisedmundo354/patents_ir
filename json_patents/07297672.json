The deposition aid is preferably a cationic polymer.",

The polysaccharide acts as a vehicle to deposit the silicone chains bound to it, onto the fabric, from a wash liquor.",

        "Many silicones that give beneficial fabric softening do not deposit well from detergent compositions because they are too viscous to from a suitable emulsion. This means that the benefit that would be derived from the efficient deposition of such viscous silicones cannot be harnessed from detergent compositions. Therefore, it is often the practice to use a silicone oil or mixture of silicone oils with a low viscosity, e.g. in the range of from 200 to 5,500 mPas. This makes the silicone easier to emulsify and deposit onto fabric. However, we have now found that by modifying the viscosity of viscous silicones that are conventionally too viscous to deposit well onto fabrics from detergent compositions, by the use of a viscosity modifying agent, surprisingly, the deposition of the viscous silicone onto fabrics is greatly improved from detergent compositions.",

In some cases, the group R\u2032 may for example contain a heteroatom, e.g. as an \u2014NH\u2014 group attached to the carbonyl, sulphonyl etc group, so that the linkage as a whole could be regarded as a urethane etc linkage.

The ester is heated at about 100\u00b0 C. with the acid which, preferably, should be a solvent for the ester. By this means cellulose acetate-oxalate, tartrate, maleate, pyruvate, salicylate and phenylglycollate have been obtained, and from cellulose tribenzoate a cellulose benzoate-pyruvate. A cellulose acetate-lactate or acetate-glycollate could be made in this way also.

Attachment of the ester groups to make a cellulose derivative causes disruption of the hydrogen bonding between rings of the cellulose chain or chains, thus increasing water solubility or dispersibility.
