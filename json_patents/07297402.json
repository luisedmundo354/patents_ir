        "This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/562,581, filed Apr. 15, 2004.",
        "The invention relates to a shaped particle. In one aspect, the invention relates to a shaped particle that can suitably be used as a catalyst support. Another aspect of the invention relates to a shaped particle catalyst system having a specific geometry.",
        "There has been an ongoing effort to design and develop shaped catalyst particles that provide for certain desired properties or even improved properties over certain prior art shapes when used in a reactor catalyst bed of a catalytic process. A number of catalyst shapes have been described in the prior art.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 3,966,644 discloses a shaped porous hydrotreating catalyst particle characterized by having a cross section with a concave geometry, which extends for a sufficient length along its axis so as to provide a solid particle. The concave geometry is preferably polylobal in that the lobes arise from circles of equal diameter and are connected so as to form a closed curve. The more preferred cross sectional geometry of the particle is a polylobal shape with three or more lobes of circles of equal diameter. The taught concaved shaped hydrotreating catalyst is presented as having advantageous catalytic activity in the hydrotreatment of petroleum residue. It is significant to note that the shapes taught by the '644 patent are either radially symmetrical or bilaterally symmetrical.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,391,740 discloses a shaped extruded catalyst particle having a polylobal cross-section that may be used in the hydroprocessing of hydrocarbon feedstocks containing sulfur and metals. The catalyst particles may be elongated extrudates of a defined non-circular cross-section that can be circumscribed by a rectangle of particular dimensions. Specific shapes include an oval cross-section, or an oval with a bump cross-section, or an oval with two bumps cross-section. It is asserted that the shapes of the '740 patent provide for an improved surface-to-volume ratio of the particle and that beds of the shaped catalyst will give lower pressure drops than other comparative shapes. It is noted that the shapes taught by the '740 patent are symmetrical.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,495,307 discloses a cylindric hydrotreatment catalyst particle having a polylobate cross-section in which the individual lobes are separated by concave interstices that are bluntly rounded with greater curvature than that of the lobes. The shape may further be defined with reference to an equilateral triangle. The taught shaped catalyst of the '307 patent is purported to have improved properties over the prior art trilobe shaped catalyst particles as are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,232,887 such as providing for better catalytic activity and improvement in pressure drop. It is noted that the shapes taught by the '307 patent are bilaterally symmetrical.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,673,664 discloses a hydrotreating catalyst particle, which is helical lobed, polylobal extrudates having the shape of three or four strands wound helically about the axis of extrusion along the length of the particles. The helical shape is supposed to provide for improved pressure drop across a fixed reactor bed of the catalyst particles. It is noted that the shapes taught by the '664 patent are either radially symmetrical or bilaterally symmetrical.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 5,097,091 discloses toothed-wheel shaped catalyst for use in dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. The toothed-wheel shaped particles have at least three teeth and specifically defined dimensional ratios for such dimensions as the ratio of crown circle diameter-to-root circle diameter, ratio of gap width on the tooth root-to-tooth width on the crown, and gap width on the tooth root. The tooth shaped catalyst is supposed to provide for improved activity and selectivity relative to a comparative catalyst. It is noted that the shapes taught by the '091 patent are either radially symmetrical or bilaterally symmetrical.",
        "While the catalyst shapes described above may provide for various benefits when used in certain catalytic processes, there is always a need to find catalyst shapes that can provide certain specific benefits that other comparative shapes do not provide or a combination of beneficial properties that may provide improvements over prior art catalyst shapes.",
        "It is, thus, an object of this invention to provide a shaped particle that can suitably be used as a support for catalytic components.",
        "It is another object of this invention to provide a shaped catalyst particle that can be used as a component of a catalyst bed of a reactor system.",
        "Therefore, in accordance with the invention, a shaped particle is provided. The shaped particle has a geometry including a length and a cross sectional geometry at at least one point along the length with the cross sectional geometry being defined by an asymmetrical shape having an imaginary dividing line providing for an upper end, having an upper end cross sectional area, and a lower end, having a lower end cross sectional area. The upper end cross sectional area is greater than the lower end cross sectional area. The shaped particle may suitably be used as a support for a catalyst component, or the shaped particle may itself be a catalyst system.",
        "In accordance with another invention, a dehydrogenation process is provided which comprises contacting under dehydrogenation reaction conditions a dehydrogenation feed with an iron oxide based dehydrogenation catalyst system that is in the form of a shaped particle. The shaped particle comprises iron oxide and has a geometry including a length and a cross sectional geometry at at least one point along the length, wherein the cross sectional geometry is defined by an asymmetrical shape having an imaginary dividing line providing for an upper end, having an upper end cross sectional area, and a lower end, having a lower end cross sectional area, wherein the upper end cross sectional area is greater than the lower end cross sectional area.",
        "FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a three-grooved embodiment of the inventive shaped particle.",
        "FIG. 2 is a cross sectional view of the three-grooved shaped particle of FIG. 1 taken along section line 2-2.",
        "FIG. 3 is a cross sectional view of a five-grooved embodiment of the inventive shaped particle.",
        "This invention relates to a multi-grooved shaped particle that may suitably be used as a catalyst support onto which a catalytic component is incorporated. A particularly desirable aspect of the invention further relates to a dehydrogenation catalyst system that is in the form of a multi-grooved shaped particle. One unique feature of the multi-grooved shaped particle is in its geometry that provides for a weight-loaded particle. It is believed that the weight loading of the particle promotes a desired orientation and more uniform packing of the multi-grooved shaped particle within a catalyst bed when it is loaded into a reactor to form the catalyst bed. This weight loading of the multi-grooved shaped catalyst particle is particularly important with an iron oxide based multi-grooved shaped catalyst particles that are for use in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons.",
        "When referring herein to a weight-loaded particle, what is meant is that the particle has a cross section and a length such that they provide for a shaped particle or pellet having an unsymmetrical cross sectional geometry. The geometry of the cross section of the shaped particle is nonsymmetrical so as to provide a portion of the cross section that has a greater cross sectional area than the remaining portion of the cross section. When the particle having the nonsymmetrical cross section is composed of a homogeneous support material or a homogeneous catalytic material, it will be loaded in the sense that the portion of the particle having the greater cross sectional area will be heavier than the remaining portion due to it containing a greater amount of mass.",
        "An alternative way of characterizing the cross section of the weight-loaded particle is to define the cross section as having at least one imaginary dividing line that passes through a central axis of the weight loaded particle thereby defining two portions of the cross section of the weight loaded particle with a portion of the cross section being on one side of the imaginary dividing line and a remaining portion of the cross section being on the opposite side of the dividing line. When the cross section is defined in this manner, it is preferred for there to be at least one imaginary dividing line that divides the cross section so as to provide a ratio of the cross sectional area of the portion of the cross section to the cross sectional area of the remaining portion of the cross section to be in the range of from about 1.1:1 to about 4:1. A preferred ratio of the cross sectional area of the portion of the cross section to the cross sectional area of the remaining portion of the cross section is in the range of from 1.25:1 to 3:1, and, most preferred, the ratio is in the range of from 1.5:1 to 2.5:1. A typical target for the ratio is about 2:1.",
        "One method of loading a reactor vessel with catalyst particles is to dump them into the reactor vessel and allowing the particles to freely drop into the reactor vessel to form a catalyst bed. Another method may include the use of a loading sock into which the catalyst particles are poured with the sock being used to direct the flow of the catalyst particles within the reactor vessel and to limit the distance that the catalyst particles freely fall before landing upon the catalyst bed being formed. Other methods of loading a reactor vessel may include the use of pneumatic devices or other conveyance devices to transfer the catalyst particles into the reactor vessel. In all of these methods, the catalyst particles that are placed into the reactor vessel fall some distance before landing and forming the catalyst bed within the reactor vessel.",
        "It is believed that the herein described inventive shaped particle will provide for an improved packed catalyst bed by giving a more uniform placement of the shaped particles within the packed bed. Thus, when loaded into a reactor vessel the freely falling, weight loaded particles will orient themselves in such a way in the formed catalyst bed that there is a certain uniformity of the placement of the catalyst particles.",
        "When referring herein to the shaped particle as being nonsymmetrical, what is meant is that the particle lacks both bilateral symmetry and radial symmetry. Bilateral symmetry is when the shape may be divided by a plane into two essentially identical halves. Radial symmetry is when the shape is symmetric in respect to an axis such that similar parts are regularly arranged around a central axis.",
        "To more fully illustrate and describe the inventive shaped particle, reference is now made to the figures presenting various embodiments of the invention. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a three-grooved shaped particle 10. The three-grooved shaped particle is characterized as having a length 12 and a cross sectional geometry 14 that is asymmetrical in shape. At a point along the length 12 of the three-grooved shaped particle 10, a cross sectional plane 2-2 is taken that is perpendicular to the central axis (not shown) of the three grooved shaped particle 10.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2, depicted is cross sectional view 2-2 of the cross sectional geometry 14 defined in part by an imaginary perimeter 16, which can have any suitable configuration or shape, but as depicted in FIG. 2, the imaginary perimeter 16 approximates a circle having a central axis 18. The imaginary perimeter 16 is further defined as having a diameter 20 and an imaginary dividing line 22 passing through the axis 18. The imaginary dividing line 22 provides for or otherwise divides the cross sectional geometry 14 into an upper end or half 24 and a lower end or half 26.",
        "The term imaginary perimeter 16, as used herein, refers to the outer boundary or edge of the cross sectional geometry 14, which is generally defined by the die or form by which the three-grooved shaped particle 10 is formed. The imaginary perimeter 16 is imaginary in the sense that, if the cross sectional geometry 14 does not include grooves, the imaginary perimeter 16 would approach a circular shape having a central axis 18. Thus, the central axis 18 is the center of the imaginary perimeter 16. The imaginary dividing line 22 passes through the central axis 18. Again, the imaginary dividing line 22 is imaginary in the sense that, if the cross sectional geometry 14 does not include grooves, the imaginary perimeter 16 would approximate a circular shape. The imaginary dividing line 22 divides the cross sectional geometry 14 into two sections with one of the sections having a greater cross sectional area than the cross sectional area of the other section. Due to the length of the shaped particle, the section having the larger cross sectional area will have a greater mass than the remaining section with the smaller cross sectional area, thus, providing for a loaded shaped particle. It is understood that the imaginary perimeter 16 may generally be circular and that it may be elongated or deviate somewhat from a perfect circle due to variances resulting from manufacturing methods and conditions.",

The imaginary perimeter 16 starting at a point such as the first trailing edge of the first groove 28 and ending at the same spot represents 360 degrees.

        "As noted above, the preferred use of the inventive shaped particle is as an iron oxide-based dehydrogenation catalyst system. The shaped iron oxide based catalyst particle is placed or loaded into a reactor vessel so as to form a so-called packed bed of the shaped catalyst particles with the packed bed having a depth within the reactor vessel. The reactor vessel is equipped with a reactor feed inlet for receiving a dehydrogenation feedstock and a reactor effluent outlet for withdrawing a dehydrogenation reaction product. A dehydrogenation feed is passed through the catalyst bed to thereby contact the dehydrogenation feed with the shaped iron oxide-based dehydrogenation catalyst particles contained within the catalyst bed. This contacting of the dehydrogenation feed with the shaped iron oxide-based dehydrogenation is conducted under suitable dehydrogenation reaction conditions.",
        "The dehydrogenation feed can be any suitable feed and, more particularly, it can include any hydrocarbon that is dehydrogenatable. Examples of dehydrogenatable hydrocarbons include substituted benzene compounds, such as ethylbenzene, isoamylenes, which can be dehydrogenated to isoprenes, and butenes, which can be dehydrogenated to butadiene. The preferred dehydrogenation feed comprises ethylbenzene, which can be dehydrogenated to styrene. The dehydrogenation feed can also include other components including diluents.",

        "It is recognized, however, that in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, the reaction is endothermic. When such a dehydrogenation reaction is carried out, it can be done so either isothermally or adiabatically. In the case where the dehydrogenation reaction is carried out adiabatically, the temperature across the dehydrogenation catalyst bed, between the dehydrogenation reactor inlet and the dehydrogenation reactor outlet, can decrease by as much as 150\u00b0 C., but, more typically, the temperature can decrease from 10\u00b0 C. to 120\u00b0 C.",
        "The reaction pressure is relatively low and can range from vacuum pressure upwardly to about 25 psia. In conducting the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation reaction, it is best to conduct the reaction under as low of pressure conditions as are possible, for instance from 5 psia to 20 psia. In this case, the use of the inventive shaped catalyst particle can be particularly beneficial by providing for a desired low-pressure reaction condition.",

As used herein, the term \u201cliquid hourly space velocity\u201d is defined as the liquid volumetric flow rate of the dehydrogenation feed, for example, ethylbenzene, measured at normal conditions (i.e., 0\u00b0 C. and 1 bar absolute), divided by the volume of the catalyst bed, or the total volume of catalyst beds if there are two or more catalyst beds. When styrene is being manufactured by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, it is generally desirable to use steam as a diluent usually in a molar ratio of steam to ethylbenzene in the range of 0.1 to 20. Steam may also be used as a diluent with other dehydrogenatable hydrocarbons.",
        "It is understood that while particular embodiments of the invention have been described herein, reasonable variations, modifications and adaptations thereof may be made within the scope of the described disclosure and the appended claims without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the claims."
