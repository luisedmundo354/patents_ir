Referring now to FIG. 3A, an alternative upright assembly 306 has two tubular portions 320a and 320b that interconnect by insertion. To accomplish a friction fit when inserted, tubular portion 320a has a smaller neck and a plurality of protrusions 321 on portion 320b create sufficient friction to selectively hold portions 320a and portion 320b together. It is also envisioned that screws, telescoping portions, threads and other like fastening means known to those of ordinary skill in the pertinent art may be utilized to secure components.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 4-12, a method for disassembling and packaging the canopy 100 in a container 200 is shown. The method includes reducing the length of each of the upright assemblies 106, horizontal rail assemblies 112 and arch rail assemblies 114 by approximately half or thirds. As a result, the length A of the container 200 can be shortened commensurately as compared with prior art containers. To accommodate the shortened length A, the width B and/or the height C of the container 200 may be increased as necessary to still house all of the components of the canopy 100. Preferably, the length is 42 inches or less to accommodate placing the container 200 in a traditional sedan automobile trunk.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 4 and 5, an empty container 200 receives several rows of tubular pipes. These tubular pipes may be tubular portions 120a and 120b of the upright assemblies 106, portions 116a-c of the horizontal rail assemblies 112, portions 118a and 118b of the arch rail assemblies 114, and combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the bottom of the container 200 has four layers of pipes thereon, wherein each layer has fewer pipes than the preceding to form a roughly triangular cross-sectional shape 131 as outlined in FIG. 13.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 6 and 7, two strips 202 are placed onto the pipes in order to help maintain the roughly triangular cross-sectional shape. Preferably, the strips 202 are cardboard. Next, the plurality of 3-way connectors 108 and 4-way connectors 110 are placed into the container 200 along with the base feet 122 and ball bungee cords 124. In a preferred embodiment, the plurality of frame connectors 108, 110 are nested in a line for reducing a length of the line and covered by at least a portion of the eight vertical posts, the eight horizontal cross rails and the six arch cross rails. As shown in FIG. 7, in order to nest the frame connectors 108, 110, the axis of each connector 110 is offset along the length of the container 200 with respect to the adjacent connector 108, 110. For adjacent, three-way connectors 108, the axis may be offset or the three-way connectors may be arranged back to back. As a result, shifting that may damage the tarp or other components is prevented.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 8 and 9, the remainder of the pipes required for the canopy 100 are placed on top of the connectors 108 and 110. The remainder of the pipes also form roughly triangular shapes 133 as outlined in FIG. 13. At this point, the components within the container 200 form a roughly rectangular cross-sectional shape. The remainder of the pipes also provide protection for the tarp 104 by separating the tarp 104 from the edges of the connectors 108, 110 that may cut or otherwise damage the tarp 104 during shifting and jostling of the components. Referring to FIGS. 10, 11 and 12, a large strip 208 is placed into the container 200. Preferably,.the large strip 208 is cardboard for.protecting the tarp 104 from damage. The tarp 104 is placed onto the large strip 208 and the container 200 can be sealed for storage, transport and display. The various components such as the tarp 104, ball bungee cords 124 and any required loose hardware may be bagged and also placed in the container 200.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, the container 200 when packaged is 42 inches by 16.5 inches by 10 when holding a 10\u00d720\u00d79.5 foot canopy 100. The two portions 118a and 118b of the arch rail assemblies 114 are 41 inch and 25.75 inch tubes, respectively. The three portions 116a-c of the horizontal rail assemblies 112 are 41 inch tubes. The tubular portions 120a and 120b of the upright assemblies 106 are 41 inch and 40 inch tubes, respectively. It is envisioned that the components of the canopy may be fabricated from steel, aluminum, plastic, polyvinyl chloride or PVC, polyethylene and combinations thereof.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 14, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the pertinent art, the roof frame portion 402 utilizes the same principles of the roof frame portion 102 described above. Accordingly, like reference numerals preceded by the numeral \u201c4\u201d instead of the numeral \u201c1\u201d, are used to indicate like elements. The horizontal rail assemblies 412 include two portions 416a and 416b. In a preferred embodiment, a length of the horizontal rail assemblies 412 is 10 feet and each portion 416a and 416b is approximately 60 inches long. Consequently, a container for storing the portions 416a and 416b is approximately 60 inches in length. As a result, if a preferred upright assembly is approximately 80 inches, the length of the container for storage is approximately 75% of the upright assembly. Circle A of FIG. 14A shows another preferred method for interconnecting portions of the roof frame portion 402 or upright assemblies 120a, 120b. Each portion 418a and 418b of the arch rail assemblies 414 include two portions 118a and 118b, each portion having a crimped section 415 to provide an interference fit between the portions 118a and 118b when engaged.",
        "While the invention has been described with respect to preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that various changes and/or modifications can be made to the invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims."
