        "This application claims priority under 35 USC 119(e)(1) to Provisional Patent Application No. 60/584,299, entitled \u201cOPTICAL ASSEMBLY,\u201d filed on Jun. 30, 2004, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "Displacement measuring interferometers monitor changes in the position of a measurement object relative to a reference object based on an optical interference signal. The interferometer generates the optical interference signal by overlapping and interfering a measurement beam reflected from the measurement object with a reference beam reflected from the reference object.",
        "Generally, the measurement and reference beams are derived from a common source. Typically, the source delivers an input beam to the interferometer, which splits the input beam into the measurement and reference beams. In some embodiments, one or more optical waveguides are used to deliver the input beam, or components of the input beam, from the light source to the interferometer.",
        "In many applications, the measurement and reference beams have orthogonal polarizations. In certain applications, the measurement and reference beams can have different frequencies as well. The different frequencies can be produced, for example, by laser Zeeman splitting, by acousto-optical modulation, or internal to the laser using birefringent elements or the like. The orthogonal polarizations allow a polarization beam-splitter to direct the measurement and reference beams to the measurement and reference objects, respectively, and combine the reflected measurement and reference beams to form overlapping exit measurement and reference beams. The overlapping exit beams form an output beam that subsequently passes through a polarizer. The polarizer mixes polarizations of the exit measurement and reference beams to form a mixed beam. Components of the exit measurement and reference beams in the mixed beam interfere with one another so that the intensity of the mixed beam varies with the relative phase of the exit measurement and reference beams.",
        "A detector measures the time-dependent intensity of the mixed beam and generates an electrical interference signal proportional to that intensity. Because the measurement and reference beams have different frequencies, the electrical interference signal includes a \u201cheterodyne\u201d signal having a beat frequency equal to the difference between the frequencies of the exit measurement and reference beams. If the lengths of the measurement and reference paths are changing relative to one another, e.g., by translating a stage that includes the measurement object, the measured beat frequency includes a Doppler shift equal to 2vnp/\u03bb, where v is the relative speed of the measurement and reference objects, \u03bb is the wavelength of the measurement and reference beams, n is the refractive index of the medium through which the light beams travel, e.g., air or vacuum, and p is the number of passes to the reference and measurement objects. Changes in the phase of the measured interference signal correspond to changes in the relative position of the measurement object, e.g., a change in phase of 2\u03c0 corresponds substantially to a distance change L of \u03bb/(2np). Distance 2L is a round-trip distance change or the change in distance to and from a stage that includes the measurement object. In other words, the phase \u03a6, ideally, is directly proportional to L, and can be expressed as\n\n\u03a6=2pkL cos2\u03b8\u2003\u2003(1)",
        "for a plane mirror interferometer, e.g., a high stability plane mirror interferometer, where",
        "k\n  =\n  \n    \n      2\n      \u2062\n      \n        \n      \n      \u2062\n      \u03c0\n      \u2062\n      \n        \n      \n      \u2062\n      n\n    \n    \u03bb\n  \n\n\n\n\nand \u03b8 is the orientation of the measurement object with respect to a nominal axis of the interferometer. This axis can be determined from the orientation of the measurement object where \u03a6 is maximized.",
        "In certain embodiments, the invention features interferometry systems that include an interferometer, an input optical assembly and an output assembly. The input optical assembly combines two substantially orthogonally polarized component beams to form an input beam for the interferometer. The output assembly splits the interferometer's output beam into a pair of secondary output beams that both include interferometric information.

Interferometry system 100 includes a polarizing beam splitter 110, a retroreflector 120, quarter wave plates 122 and 124, and a lens 140 (e.g., a single lens element). Interferometry system 100 also includes an output assembly composed of a Wollaston prism 150, and output lens, and a pair of optical fibers 162 and 164.",
        "A remote light source 115 delivers two component beams to the interferometer via two optical fibers 116 and 117. An input assembly 200 combines the component beams to form a single input beam 101 from the two component beams. The component beams are substantially orthogonally-polarized. Light source 115 can be a homodyne or heterodyne light source.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 2, input assembly 200 includes a lens 210 and Wollaston prism 220. Lens 210 and Wollaston prism 220 are positioned relative to optical fibers 116 and 117 to collimate and overlap orthogonally-polarized component beams 202 and 204 exiting the ends of the respective fibers. Lens 210 collimates the diverging beams that exit the fibers, and lens 210 and Wollaston prism 220 are arranged so that the common pupil for the collimated beams is at the diagonal of the prism. Furthermore, the focal length of the lens is chosen so that a mutual Gaussian radius of the overlapped collimated beams is the product of the fiber numerical aperture (NA) and the focal length (FL). The product of the fiber spacing and FL is chosen to match the Wollaston prism divergence. With this arrangement, the divergence angle of the Wollaston prism matches the convergence angle between the orthogonally-polarized, collimated beams. As a result, Wollaston prism 220 transmits the orthogonally polarized beams along a common path, providing single input beam 101 to the interferometer.",
        "Referring again to FIG. 1(a), polarizing beam splitter 110 splits input beam 101 into measurement beam 102 and reference beam 103. Light source 115 is a heterodyne source, producing a beam with orthogonally polarized components at different frequencies. Measurement beam 102 is formed from the component of input beam 101 that is transmitted by polarizing beam splitter 110 (e.g., the p-polarized component of beam 101). Measurement beam 102 exits assembly 100 through lens 140, reflects from measurement object 111, and returns to assembly 100 along the same path. The measurement beam passes through quarter wave plate 122 twice on its round trip to and from the measurement object, causing the measurement beam to be reflected by beam splitter 110 after its pass to the measurement object.",
        "Reference beam 103 is the component of input beam 101 that is reflected by polarizing beam splitter 110 (e.g., the s-polarized component of beam 101). Reference beam 103 reflects from retroreflector 120 and returns to beam splitter 110. The reference beam's double pass through quarter wave plate 124 results in the reflected reference beam being transmitted by polarizing beam splitter 110.",
        "The reflected measurement and reference beams exit beam splitter 110 along a common path as output beam 104. Wollaston prism 150 is positioned in the path of output beam 104 and splits output beam 104 into two secondary output beams having orthogonal polarization states that exit the Wollaston prism along divergent paths. Lens 160 focuses both secondary output beams to respective foci 105 and 106 in the focal plane of lens 160. Optical fibers 162 and 164 are positioned at or near foci 105 and 106, respectively, so that beam energy is coupled into the fiber cores. The optical fibers guide optical signals corresponding to the secondary output beams to a pair of remote detection assemblies 170 and 172, which monitor the intensity of the optical signals guided by the fibers. Detection assemblies 170 and 172 are in communication with an electronic controller 199, such as a computer or dedicated electronics consul. Electronic controller 199 receives signals from the detection assemblies and processes the signals to determine information about measurement object 111 (e.g., to determine information about changes in the relative position between the interferometer and the measurement object.",
        "The Wollaston prism is oriented so that both secondary output beams include components from both the reference and measurement beams (e.g., both s-polarized light and p-polarized light). In some embodiments, the Wollaston prism is oriented to sample substantially equal components of the reference and measurement beams. For example, the principle axes of the birefringent elements composing the prism oriented at about 45\u00b0 with respect to the plane of FIG. 1(a). In contrast, the principle axes of Wollaston prism 220 are oriented parallel and perpendicular to the plane of FIG. 1(a).",
        "Because both secondary output beams include a component corresponding to the measurement beam and a component corresponding to the reference beam they can provide a redundant measurement of the phase of the interference signal corresponding to the optical path difference between the measurement and reference beams. However, because they are orthogonally polarized, the redundant phase measurements will be separated by \u03c0.",
        "Both secondary output beams propagate in different directions relative to the direction of output beam 104. Furthermore, the paths of the secondary reference beams diverge from each other. The divergence of the secondary output beams is illustrated in FIG. 1(b) by output beam ray 104\u2032, which splits at the interface 151 in the Wollaston prism to form secondary output beam rays 105\u2032 and 106\u2032. Generally, their divergence, \u03b8, depends, at least in part, on the wedge angle of the elements composing the Wollaston prism. Typically, the secondary output beam paths diverge at angles greater than about 1-2\u00b0, but about 50\u00b0 or less (e.g., about 45\u00b0 or less, about 30\u00b0 or less, about 15\u00b0 or less, 10\u00b0 or less).",
        "In general, the type of optical fiber used in interferometry system 100 can vary. In certain embodiments, the optical fibers are single mode optical fibers. For example, for ease of alignment, multi-mode (MM) fibers can be used instead of single mode fibers, particularly when the optical assembly is used to couple beams into the fibers.",
        "In some embodiments, the optical fibers are polarization maintaining optical fibers. For example, in embodiments where the fibers are used to direct orthogonally polarized components of an input beam to an interferometer, the fibers can be suitably-oriented polarization maintaining (PM) fibers (e.g., oriented to provide the component beams so that they are substantially orthogonally-polarized when emitted from the fibers)",
        "In some embodiments, the two secondary output beams can be used to improve the accuracy of measurements made using interferometry system 100 compared to systems that utilize a single output beam. For example, the system can calculate a displacement of the measurement object from both secondary output beams and average the displacement measurements, thereby improving accuracy.",
        "As another example, in certain embodiments, the signal from secondary output beams can be used to reduce certain errors in interferometry measurements made using interferometry system 100, such as cyclic errors. In a homodyne system, for example, the difference in the secondary output beam intensities is proportional to the cosine of the interferometric phase, \u03a6, of the output beam. However, sources of errors that contribute equally to the intensity of both secondary output beams, such as cyclic errors (e.g., to first order), are therefore removed from difference values of the secondary beam intensities. Thus, the contribution of certain error sources can be reduced where an interference phase related to the optical path difference of the measurement and reference beams is determined from the difference of the secondary beam intensities. In certain embodiments, changes in the interference phase in the output beam can be monitored from the parameter (I1\u2212I2)/(I1+I2), where I1 and I2 refer to the intensity of secondary output beams 105 and 106, respectively.",
        "In some embodiments, a number of Wollaston prism/lens assemblies can be used in an array of distance-measuring interferometers so that each interferometer produces a pair of output beams. For example, referring to FIG. 3, an interferometry system 300 includes four interferometer assemblies 310, 320, 330, and 340. An input assembly that includes a lens 358 and a Wollaston prism 352 provide an input beam 302 to the four interferometer assemblies. Beam splitters 362, 364, 366, and mirror 368 derive individual input beams from input beam 302 for interferometer assemblies 310, 320, 330, and 340, respectively.",

The measurement and reference beams are orthogonally polarized. The interferometers direct respective measurement beams 311, 321, 331, and 341, along measurement beam paths 311, 321, 331, and 341. One or more measurement objects (not shown) reflect the measurement beams back to the respective interferometer, which combines the reflected measurement beam with its reference beam to form an output beam.",

Specifically, interferometer assembly 310, for example, includes Wollaston prism 312 and lens 314, which splits the interferometer assembly's output beam into two secondary output beams and focuses the secondary output beams to different foci at location 315. Correspondingly, Wollaston prisms 322, 332, and 342 are positioned adjacent interferometer assemblies 320, 330, and 340, respectively, and each split the interferometer assembly's output beam into two secondary output beams. Furthermore, lenses 324, 334, and 344 each focus respective secondary output beams to corresponding foci at locations 325, 335, and 345.",

The reference beam is subsequently split into two secondary reference beams by a Wollaston prism 354 positioned adjacent beam splitter 350. The secondary reference beams are focused by a lens 356 to respective foci at location 303. Wollaston prism 354 is oriented so that both secondary reference beams include polarization components of input beam 302 that form the reference and measurement beams in interferometers 310, 320, 330, and 340. Accordingly, the secondary reference beams provide redundant reference signals for the system.",

Overlay improvement is one of the five most difficult challenges down to and below 100 nm line widths (design rules), see, for example, the Semiconductor Industry Roadmap, p. 82 (1997).",
        "Overlay depends directly on the performance, i.e., accuracy and precision, of the distance measuring interferometers used to position the wafer and reticle (or mask) stages. Since a lithography tool may produce $50-100 M/year of product, the economic value from improved performance distance measuring interferometers is substantial. Each 1% increase in yield of the lithography tool results in approximately $1 M/year economic benefit to the integrated circuit manufacturer and substantial competitive advantage to the lithography tool vendor.",
        "The function of a lithography tool is to direct spatially patterned radiation onto a photoresist-coated wafer. The process involves determining which location of the wafer is to receive the radiation (alignment) and applying the radiation to the photoresist at that location (exposure).",
        "To properly position the wafer, the wafer includes alignment marks on the wafer that can be measured by dedicated sensors. The measured positions of the alignment marks define the location of the wafer within the tool. This information, along with a specification of the desired patterning of the wafer surface, guides the alignment of the wafer relative to the spatially patterned radiation. Based on such information, a translatable stage supporting the photoresist-coated wafer moves the wafer such that the radiation will expose the correct location of the wafer.",
        "During exposure, a radiation source illuminates a patterned reticle, which scatters the radiation to produce the spatially patterned radiation. The reticle is also referred to as a mask, and these terms are used interchangeably below. In the case of reduction lithography, a reduction lens collects the scattered radiation and forms a reduced image of the reticle pattern. Alternatively, in the case of proximity printing, the scattered radiation propagates a small distance (typically on the order of microns) before contacting the wafer to produce a 1:1 image of the reticle pattern. The radiation initiates photo-chemical processes in the resist that convert the radiation pattern into a latent image within the resist.",
        "Interferometry systems are important components of the positioning mechanisms that control the position of the wafer and reticle, and register the reticle image on the wafer. If such interferometry systems include the features described above, the accuracy of distances measured by the systems increases as cyclic error contributions to the distance measurement are minimized.",
        "In general, the lithography system, also referred to as an exposure system, typically includes an illumination system and a wafer positioning system. The illumination system includes a radiation source for providing radiation such as ultraviolet, visible, x-ray, electron, or ion radiation, and a reticle or mask for imparting the pattern to the radiation, thereby generating the spatially patterned radiation. In addition, for the case of reduction lithography, the illumination system can include a lens assembly for imaging the spatially patterned radiation onto the wafer. The imaged radiation exposes resist coated onto the wafer. The illumination system also includes a mask stage for supporting the mask and a positioning system for adjusting the position of the mask stage relative to the radiation directed through the mask. The wafer positioning system includes a wafer stage for supporting the wafer and a positioning system for adjusting the position of the wafer stage relative to the imaged radiation. Fabrication of integrated circuits can include multiple exposing steps. For a general reference on lithography, see, for example, J. R. Sheats and B. W. Smith, in Microlithography: Science and Technology (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1998), the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "Interferometry systems described above can be used to precisely measure the positions of each of the wafer stage and mask stage relative to other components of the exposure system, such as the lens assembly, radiation source, or support structure. In such cases, the interferometry system can be attached to a stationary structure and the measurement object attached to a movable element such as one of the mask and wafer stages. Alternatively, the situation can be reversed, with the interferometry system attached to a movable object and the measurement object attached to a stationary object.",
        "More generally, such interferometry systems can be used to measure the position of any one component of the exposure system relative to any other component of the exposure system, in which the interferometry system is attached to, or supported by, one of the components and the measurement object is attached, or is supported by the other of the components.",
        "An example of a lithography scanner 1100 using an interferometry system 1126 is shown in FIG. 4. The interferometry system is used to precisely measure the position of a wafer (not shown) within an exposure system. Here, stage 1122 is used to position and support the wafer relative to an exposure station. Scanner 1100 includes a frame 1102, which carries other support structures and various components carried on those structures. An exposure base 1104 has mounted on top of it a lens housing 1106 atop of which is mounted a reticle or mask stage 1116, which is used to support a reticle or mask. A positioning system for positioning the mask relative to the exposure station is indicated schematically by element 1117. Positioning system 1117 can include, e.g., piezoelectric transducer elements and corresponding control electronics. Although, it is not included in this described embodiment, one or more of the interferometry systems described above can also be used to precisely measure the position of the mask stage as well as other moveable elements whose position must be accurately monitored in processes for fabricating lithographic structures (see supra Sheats and Smith Microlithography: Science and Technology).",
        "Suspended below exposure base 1104 is a support base 1113 that carries wafer stage 1122. Stage 1122 includes a plane mirror 1128 for reflecting a measurement beam 1154 directed to the stage by interferometry system 1126. A positioning system for positioning stage 1122 relative to interferometry system 1126 is indicated schematically by element 1119. Positioning system 1119 can include, e.g., piezoelectric transducer elements and corresponding control electronics. The measurement beam reflects back to the interferometry system, which is mounted on exposure base 1104. The interferometry system can be any of the embodiments described previously.",
        "During operation, a radiation beam 1110, e.g., an ultraviolet (UV) beam from a UV laser (not shown), passes through a beam shaping optics assembly 1112 and travels downward after reflecting from mirror 1114. Thereafter, the radiation beam passes through a mask (not shown) carried by mask stage 1116. The mask (not shown) is imaged onto a wafer (not shown) on wafer stage 1122 via a lens assembly 1108 carried in a lens housing 1106. Base 1104 and the various components supported by it are isolated from environmental vibrations by a damping system depicted by spring 1120.",
        "In other embodiments of the lithographic scanner, one or more of the interferometry systems described previously can be used to measure distance along multiple axes and angles associated for example with, but not limited to, the wafer and reticle (or mask) stages. Also, rather than a UV laser beam, other beams can be used to expose the wafer including, e.g., x-ray beams, electron beams, ion beams, and visible optical beams.",
        "In some embodiments, the lithographic scanner can include what is known in the art as a column reference. In such embodiments, the interferometry system 1126 directs the reference beam (not shown) along an external reference path that contacts a reference mirror (not shown) mounted on some structure that directs the radiation beam, e.g., lens housing 1106. The reference mirror reflects the reference beam back to the interferometry system. The interference signal produce by interferometry system 1126 when combining measurement beam 1154 reflected from stage 1122 and the reference beam reflected from a reference mirror mounted on the lens housing 1106 indicates changes in the position of the stage relative to the radiation beam. Furthermore, in other embodiments the interferometry system 1126 can be positioned to measure changes in the position of reticle (or mask) stage 1116 or other movable components of the scanner system. Finally, the interferometry systems can be used in a similar fashion with lithography systems involving steppers, in addition to, or rather than, scanners.",
        "As is well known in the art, lithography is a critical part of manufacturing methods for making semiconducting devices. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,483,343 outlines steps for such manufacturing methods. These steps are described below with reference to FIGS. 5a and 5b. FIG. 5a is a flow chart of the sequence of manufacturing a semiconductor device such as a semiconductor chip (e.g., IC or LSI), a liquid crystal panel or a CCD. Step 1151 is a design process for designing the circuit of a semiconductor device. Step 1152 is a process for manufacturing a mask on the basis of the circuit pattern design. Step 1153 is a process for manufacturing a wafer by using a material such as silicon.",
        "Step 1154 is a wafer process which is called a pre-process wherein, by using the so prepared mask and wafer, circuits are formed on the wafer through lithography. To form circuits on the wafer that correspond with sufficient spatial resolution those patterns on the mask, interferometric positioning of the lithography tool relative the wafer is necessary. The interferometry methods and systems described herein can be especially useful to improve the effectiveness of the lithography used in the wafer process.",
        "Step 1155 is an assembling step, which is called a post-process wherein the wafer processed by step 1154 is formed into semiconductor chips. This step includes assembling (dicing and bonding) and packaging (chip sealing). Step 1156 is an inspection step wherein operability check, durability check and so on of the semiconductor devices produced by step 1155 are carried out. With these processes, semiconductor devices are finished and they are shipped (step 1157).",
        "FIG. 5b is a flow chart showing details of the wafer process. Step 1161 is an oxidation process for oxidizing the surface of a wafer. Step 1162 is a CVD process for forming an insulating film on the wafer surface. Step 1163 is an electrode forming process for forming electrodes on the wafer by vapor deposition. Step 1164 is an ion implanting process for implanting ions to the wafer. Step 1165 is a resist process for applying a resist (photosensitive material) to the wafer. Step 1166 is an exposure process for printing, by exposure (i.e., lithography), the circuit pattern of the mask on the wafer through the exposure apparatus described above. Once again, as described above, the use of the interferometry systems and methods described herein improve the accuracy and resolution of such lithography steps.",
        "Step 1167 is a developing process for developing the exposed wafer. Step 1168 is an etching process for removing portions other than the developed resist image. Step 1169 is a resist separation process for separating the resist material remaining on the wafer after being subjected to the etching process. By repeating these processes, circuit patterns are formed and superimposed on the wafer.",
        "The interferometry systems described above can also be used in other applications in which the relative position of an object needs to be measured precisely. For example, in applications in which a write beam such as a laser, x-ray, ion, or electron beam, marks a pattern onto a substrate as either the substrate or beam moves, the interferometry systems can be used to measure the relative movement between the substrate and write beam.",
        "As an example, a schematic of a beam writing system 1200 is shown in FIG. 6. A source 1210 generates a write beam 1212, and a beam focusing assembly 1214 directs the radiation beam to a substrate 1216 supported by a movable stage 1218. To determine the relative position of the stage, an interferometry system 1220 directs a reference beam 1222 to a mirror 1224 mounted on beam focusing assembly 1214 and a measurement beam 1226 to a mirror 1228 mounted on stage 1218. Since the reference beam contacts a mirror mounted on the beam focusing assembly, the beam writing system is an example of a system that uses a column reference. Interferometry system 1220 can be any of the interferometry systems described previously. Changes in the position measured by the interferometry system correspond to changes in the relative position of write beam 1212 on substrate 1216. Interferometry system 1220 sends a measurement signal 1232 to controller 1230 that is indicative of the relative position of write beam 1212 on substrate 1216. Controller 1230 sends an output signal 1234 to a base 1236 that supports and positions stage 1218. In addition, controller 1230 sends a signal 1238 to source 1210 to vary the intensity of, or block, write beam 1212 so that the write beam contacts the substrate with an intensity sufficient to cause photophysical or photochemical change only at selected positions of the substrate.",
        "Furthermore, in some embodiments, controller 1230 can cause beam focusing assembly 1214 to scan the write beam over a region of the substrate, e.g., using signal 1244. As a result, controller 1230 directs the other components of the system to pattern the substrate. The patterning is typically based on an electronic design pattern stored in the controller. In some applications the write beam patterns a resist coated on the substrate and in other applications the write beam directly patterns, e.g., etches, the substrate.",
        "An important application of such a system is the fabrication of masks and reticles used in the lithography methods described previously. For example, to fabricate a lithography mask an electron beam can be used to pattern a chromium-coated glass substrate. In such cases where the write beam is an electron beam, the beam writing system encloses the electron beam path in a vacuum. Also, in cases where the write beam is, e.g., an electron or ion beam, the beam focusing assembly includes electric field generators such as quadrapole lenses for focusing and directing the charged particles onto the substrate under vacuum. In other cases where the write beam is a radiation beam, e.g., x-ray, UV, or visible radiation, the beam focusing assembly includes corresponding optics and for focusing and directing the radiation to the substrate.",
        "A number of embodiments of the invention have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."
