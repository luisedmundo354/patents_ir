        "The present invention relates generally to semiconductor device monitoring, and specifically to the preparation and imaging of thin samples for testing internal structure of fabricated devices.",
        "In the study of electronic materials and processes for fabricating such materials into an electronic structure, a specimen of the electronic structure is frequently used for microscopic examination for purposes of failure analysis and device validation. For instance, a specimen of an electronic structure such as a silicon wafer is frequently analyzed in scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) to study a specific characteristic feature in the wafer. Such characteristic feature may include the circuit fabricated and any defects formed during the fabrication process. An electron microscope is one of the most useful equipment for analyzing the microscopic structure of semiconductor devices.",
        "In preparing specimens of an electronic structure for electron microscopic examination, various polishing and milling processes can be used to section the structure until a specific characteristic feature is exposed.",
        "As device dimensions are continuously reduced to the sub-half-micron level, the techniques for preparing specimens for study in an electron microscope have become more important. The conventional methods for studying structures by an optical microscope cannot be used to study features in a modem electronic structure due to the unacceptable resolution of an optical microscope.",
        "In the focused ion beam (FIB) technique, focused ion beam is used to either locally deposit or remove materials. Typical ion beams have a focused spot size of smaller than 100 nm when produced by a high intensity source. Sources of such high intensity ions can be either liquid metal ion sources or gas field ion sources. Both of these sources have a needle type form that relies on field ionization or evaporation to produce the ion beam. After the ion beam is produced, it is deflected in a high vacuum and directed to a desired surface area. The focused ion beams can be suitably used in the semiconductor processing industry in a cutting or attaching method to perform a circuit repair, a mask repair or a micromachining process. A cutting process is normally performed by locally sputtering a surface with a focused ion beam.",
        "In an ion beam milling process, a material is selectively etched by a beam of ions such as Ga+ focused to a sub-micron diameter, the technique is often referred to as focused ion beam etching or milling. FIB milling is a very useful technique for restructuring a pattern on a mask or an integrated circuit, and for diagnostic cross-sectioning of microstructures. In a typical FIB etching process, a beam of ions such as Ga+ is incident onto a surface to be etched and the beam is deflected to produce a desirable pattern. The focused ion beam can be used to bombard a specimen surface such that a cavity is formed on the surface of an electronic structure to review a characteristic feature of the structure for electron microscopic examination. The FIB technique utilizes a primary beam of ions for removing a layer of material at a high current, and for observing the surface that was newly formed at a low current. The observation of the surface is made by detecting the secondary electrons emitted from the sample surface when the surface is bombarded by the ions. A detector is used to receive the secondary electrons emitted from the surface to form an image. Even though the FIB method can not produce an image of a high resolution like that obtainable in a SEM/TEM, the FIB method can be used to sufficiently identify a newly formed cross-sectional surface which may contain the characteristic feature to be examined. The capability of the FIB technique for making observations down to a resolution of 5\u02dc10 nm enables the cutting of a precise plane in an electronic structure such that the electronic structure may be later examined by a SEM or TEM technique at a higher resolution than that capable with FIB.",
        "Although TEM techniques can provide a higher resolution image and a more detailed description of the internal structure of a than is available using SEM techniques, they are only effective for electron transparent samples. Thus it is a basic requirement for TEM samples that the sample must be thin enough to be penetrated by the electron beam and thin enough to avoid multiple scattering, which causes image blurring. Nonetheless, it is recognized in the art that thin samples extracted from wafers may be brittle, and subject to fracture or crumbling. Furthermore, the fragile nature of thin extracted samples means that processes for extracting thin samples are difficult to automate, thus hindering efforts to automate these processes. There is an ongoing need for reliable and automated techniques for the obtaining and imaging of TEM samples to make TEM sampling a viable part of semiconductor analysis and manufacturing.",
        "An additional technique for conducting electron transparency analysis with nanometer level spatial resolution is scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The TEM is an apparatus in which an electron beam is irradiated onto a sample, and the transmitted electron beam is magnified using a lens. On the other hand, the STEM is an apparatus in which an electron beam is focused onto a micro-area, and a two-dimensional image is obtained by measuring intensities of the transmitted electron beam while the electron beam is being scanned on the sample. US 20030127595, incorporated herein by reference, discloses methods and apparatus for scanning transmission electron microscopy.",
        "Enabled by automated, multicolumn tools combining SEM and FIB in a single device, automated techniques for the obtaining and imaging of SEM samples are already well known and are employed in the automated reviewing of defects and for process monitoring. Examples of commercially available models of such multicolumn tools include SEMVision\u2122 G2 FIB (Applied Materials, Santa Clara, Calif.) and the DualBeam\u2122 (FEI Company, Hillsboro, Oreg.). It is noted that the SEMVision\u2122 G2 FIB is also used in process control.",

In some embodiments, a wafer is pre-cleaved before placing in the vacuum chamber to form and extract the sample. In some embodiments, the object is substantially prismatic.",
        "It is now disclosed for the first time a method of sample and imaging including placing an object into a vacuum chamber, forming a sample from the object, and subjecting an object cross section surface of the sample to microanalysis, wherein the forming and microanalysis are carried out while the sample is in the vacuum chamber.",
        "According to some embodiment, microanalysis includes subjecting the sample to a particle beam selected from the group consisting of an ion beam and an electron beam, wherein the particle beam is incident substantially normally to said object cross section surface.",
        "It is now disclosed for the first time a method of extracting and mounting a sample. The disclosed method includes forming the sample from the object so that the sample includes an object cross section surface of the object, and situating at least one sample onto a surface of a sample support that includes at least one aperture so that the object cross section surface of the sample is substantially parallel to the surface of sample support.",
        "According to some embodiments, the sample is further subjected to electron transparency analysis within the same vacuum chamber that the sample was formed from the object. Alternately, at least one mounted sample onto a loading station or cassette. Optionally the loading station or cassette can be shipped to a separate tool for electron transparency analysis.",
        "According to some embodiments, the forming of the sample produces an indentation in the object, and the method further includes depositing material into the indentation.",
        "According to particular embodiments, the deposition is carried in the vacuum chamber. According to particular embodiments, the indentation is completely filled by the deposited material. According to particular embodiments, the deposition includes focused ion beam deposition.",
        "Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is now disclosed that methods provided by embodiments of the present invention cause minimal damage to a semiconductor wafer while still allowing for defect analysis and process control including electron transparency of a cross section of the wafer. Furthermore, it is now disclosed that the optional filling of the indentation with deposited material further minimizes the damage rendered to the wafer by the sampling process.",
        "It is now disclosed for the first time a method forming a sample of an object in a vacuum chamber, and iteratively thinning and imaging the sample inside the vacuum chamber, producing a plurality of images. The disclosed method includes providing an object in a vacuum chamber, forming a sample from the object inside the vacuum chamber, thinning at least a portion of the sample with an ion beam, and imaging the thinned sample, wherein at least a portion of said sample is subjected to an electron beam.",

        "In some embodiments, at least one stage of imaging further includes subjecting at least a portion of the sample to optical microscopy.",
        "In some embodiments, the thinning and imaging are repeated at least once until said at least a portion of said electron microscopy specimen is eliminated by said thinning.",
        "Any known method for thinning a sample with an ion beam is appropriate for the disclosed method. Appropriate methods include but are not limited to subjecting the sample to a focused ion beam, and subjecting the sample to a beam of argon ions from an ion gun.",
        "In some embodiments, the thinning includes selective removal of material.",
        "Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is disclosed the embodiments of the present invention that recite iterative thinning and electron transparency analysis of a sample are also appropriate for samples that are not necessarily electron-transparent upon removal from the wafer. This embodiment of the present invention is particularly advantageous, since more structurally sound samples are less prone to mechanical damage such as fracture upon formation or removal from the wafer. More stable samples are easier to handle, and are particularly appropriate for embodiments where the methods of sample preparation and imaging are automated.",
        "Furthermore, it is noted that for some embodiments the optimal sample thickness for imaging is not known a priori. Thus, embodiments of the present invention provide methods for obtaining a plurality of imaging, each one reflecting a different sample thickness. In some embodiments, the alternate sample thinning and imaging are performed automatically.",

It is noted that for some embodiments, this allows for the mounting of thicker and more stable samples than would otherwise be used.",
        "Although certain embodiments of the invention do not preclude the precleaving of an object or semiconductor wafer before sample formation, the techniques of the present invention do not require the wafer to be precleaved before extracting the samples, and do not require mechanical milling as part of the sample formation process. Embodiments and methods where the wafer is not precleaved are easier to automate, thus providing for defect analysis and process control in a manner that is minimally disruptive to the semiconductor manufacturing practice. Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is noted that obtaining samples from the wafer using methods of the present invention does only minimal damage to the wafer, leaving much of the wafer intact, and minimizing the economic impact of defect analysis on the overall cost of the manufacturing process.",

Heretofore, this automatic tool was not possible, due to the difficulties associated sample handling, and more specifically, due to difficulties with automatically removing an electron-transparent sample and mounting the sample for imaging. More specifically, the lack of a process whereby a sample of a sample can be milled to a very small thickness that is not limited by the sample transfer process from the wafer in the same vacuum chamber in which the sample is formed precluded the creation of the tool disclosed herein. Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is noted that methods of embodiments of the present invention overcome these difficulties.",

        "In accordance with many embodiments of the present invention, a disclosed method for sample formation begins with cutting of a portion of an object. In one specific embodiment, the object is a semiconductor wafer, though in other embodiments, exemplary objects include a biological material, a micromechanical device, a thin film, etc.",
        "FIG. 1 provides an exemplary illustration of an object 102 from which a portion is to be extracted near a target location 106, the object 102 including an upper or outer surface 112. In FIG. 1, the object 102 depicted is of cylindrical shape, though this is by no means a limitation, and the present invention may be practiced with an object of any shape, including objects of substantially rectangular prism shape, objects of irregular dimensions, or any other shape. In some embodiments, the object 102 is a semiconductor wafer. It is noted that for many embodiments, the object 102 is a cylindrically shaped semiconductor wafer, and the relative dimensions of the diameter of the object 102 and the thickness of the object 102 as depicted in FIG. 1 is not to scale. For many such embodiments, the wafer is much thinner relative to the diameter than is shown in FIG. 1.",
        "In many embodiments, the initial cutting penetrates the upper surface of the object 102. In particular embodiments, the target location 106 is chosen based on the presence of a particular feature of interest warranting further study using electron transparency analysis. Exemplary features include failing semiconductor devices such as capacitors made of a number of sequentially deposited layers, or a metal contact in a memory cell. In the semiconductor industry, such failing devices are commonly located through electrical-failure-site maps using various surface and voltage features. Such a feature normally would have a microstructure penetrating into the bulk of the wafer and may be surrounded by other microstructures such as other cell circuitry. For purposes of illustration, the feature of interest will be assumed to be in a Y-Z plane defined by the Z and Y axes. It will be appreciated that because the feature is included in the Y-Z plane, the Y-Z plane defines a cross-section plane of the object 102 to be exposed in specimen preparation.",
        "Although only one target location 106 is illustrated on upper surface 112 of object 102, in various embodiments more than one target location 106 exists, and samples are extracted and imaged from multiple target locations.",
        "After identifying the specific location 106, a sample is formed by cutting object 102 through upper surface 112. Although not a specific requirement, in many embodiments, the cutting technique includes an ion beam milling technique, preferably a focused ion beam milling technique. In the focused ion beam (\u201cFIB\u201d) technique, an object 102 or a subsection of object 102 is mounted on a specimen holder (not shown) and conveniently placed into a focused ion beam chamber (not shown) for focused ion beam milling. It is noted that for many embodiments wherein a FIB technique is used to cut the object 102, the present invention provides methods for sample extraction wherein other portions of the object are not subjected to incidental damage. Such incidental damage is especially costly for the embodiments wherein the object 102 is a semiconductor wafer.",
        "The FIB may be either a single-beam model, or a dual-beam model. Typical FIB instruments are those manufactured by Applied Materials (Applied Materials, Santa Clara, Calif.) including the SEMVision\u2122 G2 FIB and those available from FEI Company of Hillsboro, Oreg., as models 200, 820, 830, or 835.

In FIG. 2A, the vector B represents the incident vector of the ion beam, while the vector N represents the outward normal of an outer surface 124 of sample 104. As used herein, the \u201couter surface\u201d of the sample refers to a surface affixed in the sample corresponding to the upper surface 112 of the object 102. When the sample 104 is subsequently removed from the object 102 and subjected to rotation, the outer surface 124 of the sample 104 affixed therein rotates with the sample.",
        "In the embodiments depicted in FIGS. 2A-D, sample 104 is a thin sample with two substantially parallel walls, or a membrane shaped sample, and sample 104 includes a region with a shape that is substantially a rectangular prism. In certain exemplary embodiments the width of this rectangular prism along the Y axis is \u02dc15-20 \u03bcm, the depth of this rectangular prism along the Z axis is \u02dc3-5 \u03bcm.

        "In some embodiments wherein it is intended to subject a portion of sample 104 to electron transparency analysis, a thickness along the X axis is 20-100 nm. Nevertheless, this thickness range should not be construed as a limitation, as embodiments of the present invention provide apparatus and methods for thinning a sample extracted from the object in the same vacuum chamber in which the sample is formed. Thus, in some embodiments where it is intended to subject a portion of sample 104 to electron transparency analysis, the thickness along the X axis is greater than 100 nm, even on the order of magnitude of a micron. For these embodiments, the sample is thinned after formation before electron transparency analysis. Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is noted that a thicker sample is it is less likely to fracture or crumble.",
        "For embodiments where it is intended to subject the sample 104 to microanalysis other than electron transparency analysis, the sample may be of any thickness along the X axis. In some embodiments, the sample thickness is greater than 100 nm.",

As used herein, a \u201csample wall\u201d is a surface of the sample 104 affixed on the sample that is substantially perpendicular to an outer surface affixed within the sample. Examples of sample walls include proximal 120 and distal 122 object cross section surfaces. In some embodiments, a sample wall is adjacent to the outer surface.",
        "In some embodiments, the sample comprises a segment having two substantially parallel surfaces. As used herein, an \u201cobject cross section surface\u201d is a sample wall affixed on the sample that is substantially parallel to parallel trenches 110 and 108 upon formation of the parallel trenches. Exemplary object cross section surfaces include proximal 120 and distal 122 object cross section surfaces.",
        "In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, it has been found by the present inventors that it is useful to subject sample walls, more particularly object cross section surfaces to microanalysis wherein the sample wall or object cross section surface is subjected to a beam of electrons to produce a microanalysis image.",
        "Optionally, the object cross section surface is iteratively thinned and microanalyzed, providing a plurality images wherein each image represents a different exposed object cross section surface.",
        "It is noted for the stage of sample formation depicted in FIG. 2B, there is no fundamental difference between the proximal and distal sample walls, and the method for sample formation does not require any asymmetry in the sample geometry at this stage. Thus, the denoting of surfaces 120 and 122 as \u201cproximal\u201d and \u201cdistal\u201d object cross section surfaces is arbitrary for the stage of sample formation depicted in FIG. 2B. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the proximal 120 and distal 122 object cross section surfaces are treated differently at a later stage in the sample formation and extraction process.",
        "Subsequent to the forming of the membrane shaped sample 104, sample 104 is removed from the surrounding object 102.",
        "Various techniques for cutting a completely formed sample and for removing the sample from the wafer are well known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,700,121 discloses the cutting of a sample from a larger object by forming two adjacent parallel trenches, where the sample is formed with a tether connecting the sample to the larger object. The sample is subsequently detached from the larger object using a micromanipulator. Exemplary techniques include but are not limited to those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,188,072, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.",
        "An additional technique for cutting a completely formed sample and for subsequently detaching the sample is disclosed in U.S. published patent application 2002/0121614, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, which discloses a method of sample separation and lift-out by cutting with an ion beam a first cut into the wafer at a substantially normal incidence, and subsequently cutting with an ion beam a second cut into the wafer, undercutting the target so that the sample is completely released from the wafer. The sample can be removed from the wafer by affixing a probe to the sample, and then separating the sample from the wafer with the probe. It is to be understood that any of these disclosed methods, as well as others known to the skilled artisan, for forming a sample from a portion of the wafer, and for removing this sample from the wafer may be employed in accord with the present invention.",
        "FIG. 2C illustrates an exemplary method for undercutting the membrane-shaped sample 104. In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 2C, the incident angle of the beam B is shifted to orient the vector B so that it is tilted from the surface 112 in order to form a wedge 126 underneath the rectangular prism. It is noted that either the proximal 120 or distal 122 object cross section surfaces or both surfaces may optionally be polished with a FIB beam after the formation of the substantially parallel trenches 110 and 108.",
        "There are different techniques known in the art for reorienting a corpuscular beam relative to an object upon which the beam is incident. In some embodiments, the object is situated on rotatable and tiltable stage, and an angle of incidence is changed by rotating and/or tilting the stage. In some embodiments, the beam source is an ion beam column, and the angle of incidence is changed by rotating or tilting the beam column. For example, a disclosure of rotation of a corpuscular beam column is available in U.S. Pat. No. 5,329,125, incorporated herein by reference. Nevertheless, this is not limiting, and it is noted that other techniques known in the art for tilting beam column are also appropriate for the present invention.",

        "FIG. 2D provides a perspective view of the next step of sample formation, whereby one 121 of the two remaining walls connecting sample 104 to object 102 is cut away. In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 2D, the thin connecting wall 121 is cut away using a milling beam. It is noted that according to some embodiments, the thin connecting wall 121 is optionally cut at an angle \u25a1 to the X axis. Exemplary values of \u25a1 range from about 0.01\u00b0 to about to 0.2\u00b0.",

        "In particular embodiments, before sample removal, a probe or needle is attached to the sample in order to remove the sample from the wafer. In some embodiments, the object 102 is resting on a stage (not shown), and once the needle or probe is attached to the object 102, the sample is removed by lowering the stage.",

        "FIG. 3A provides an illustration of an exemplary system wherein a needle 128 is welded to sample 104 using metal deposition with FIB. It is to be understood that welding is just one method of affixing needle 128 to sample 104, and that any other technique, including affixing needle 128 using electrostatic attractive forces or adhesive, is appropriate for the practice of the present invention.",
        "The translational and rotational motion of needle 128 may be controlled by a human operator, or alternatively, may be controlled by a robotic controller.",
        "In specific embodiments, the position of the needle is controlled using a vacuum or atmosphere manipulator. In embodiments in which the methods of the current invention are performed automatically, the motion of the needle is controlled by a robotic controller. Although the needle or probe may be attached to the sample at any angle and to any location on the outer surface 124 of the sample 104, it is now disclosed specific orientations by which the needle or probe is attached to the sample 104. FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrates an exemplary needle orientations and location. Thus, according to some embodiments, the probe or needle is affixed to said outer surface 124 of the sample such that said probe is substantially nonparallel to the outer surface of the sample 124.",
        "In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 3A and FIGS. 3B, it is noted that the probe or needle 128 is oriented away from the outer surface 124. According to some embodiments, this orientation implies that the minimal distance between the center 125 of the outer surface 124 and a vector representing the projection of said probe onto the outer surface is given by the distance between the center 125 of the outer surface 124 and the point of contact 127 between the probe or needle 128 and the outer surface of the sample 124. According to some embodiments, the probe or needle 128 is oriented at an angle that is substantially 55 degrees from the normal vector of the outer surface 124 of the sample 104.",
        "It is noted that in embodiments depicted in FIGS. 3A and 3B, a probe or needle vector originating at the point of contact 127 in the direction of the probe or needle is oriented in the (1,1,1) direction relative to the x-y-z axis affixed to the sample 104. It is noted that the (1,1,1) orientation of the attached needle once more distinguishes between the proximal object cross section surface 120 and the distal object cross section surface 122.",
        "In some embodiments, the probe or needle orientation facilitates rotation of the sample 104 upon removal from the object 102 such that the proximal object cross section surface 120 faces upwards once the sample 104 has been removed from the wafer 102. In some embodiments, the rotation is substantially a 120 degree rotation, as depicted in FIG. 3C.",
        "FIG. 3B illustrates an embodiment of the present invention wherein once the probe or needle is attached, a second wall 123 attaching the sample 104 to the object 102 is cut away. In some embodiments, the cutting of the second wall 123 is performed effected with a focused ion beam.",
        "Once the sample 104 with the probe or needle 128 attached is cut away and detached from the object 102, the sample 104 is removed from object 102. In some embodiments, this removal is effected by lifting the sample 104 from the object with the affixed probe 128. In some embodiments, removal of the sample 104 is effected by lowering a stage (not shown) upon which object 102 is resting while the sample is attached to a needle or probe 128.",
        "An exemplary illustration of sample 104 after sample 104 is extracted from object 102 and rotated is provided in FIGS. 4A and 4B. It is noted that the membrane shaped sample 104 depicted in FIGS. 4A-B has a beam shape in the Y-Z plane. Although the beam shape is not a requirement of the present invention, it is understood that this shape may imbue the sample with extra stability, lowering the probability that the sample will crack or break during sample formation, sample removal or imaging of the sample. It is understood that if the original sample 104 is too thin (in the X direction according to the axis provided in FIG. 4A), then the sample is more likely to be fragile, and could be physically damaged upon removal from the wafer, or thereafter, and could also adversely impact efforts to automate this process. On the other hand, if the original sample 104 is too thick, this may encumber subsequent efforts to thin the sample so as allow electron transparency analysis in the thickness dimension (the X dimension depicted in FIG. 4A), for those embodiments where it is desired to subject the sample to electron transparency analysis. For embodiments in which the sample is subsequently thinned using FIB milling, a sample that is initially too thick concomitantly increases the time necessary to FIB mill the sample to a thickness appropriate for electron transparency analysis.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 5A, subsequent to the extraction of sample 104 from object 102, sample 104 is affixed to an upper surface 130 of a sample support 134. In some embodiments, the sample 104 is beneath an ion beam when extracted from object 104, attached to probe or needle 128 and suspended in the vacuum chamber. Subsequently, a stage holding a sample support 134 is brought underneath sample 104, so that it may be lowered onto the desired location of the sample support 134.",
