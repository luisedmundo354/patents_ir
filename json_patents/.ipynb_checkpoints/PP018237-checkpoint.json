        "Latin name of the genus and species of the plant claimed: Gaura lindheimeri.",
        "Varietal denomination: \u2018Gaudpin\u2019.",
        "The present invention comprises a new and distinct Gaura plant, botanically known as Gaura lindheimeri, and hereinafter referred to by the cultivar name \u2018Gaudpin.\u2019",
        "The new cultivar was developed by the inventor in a controlled breeding program during 2000, at Enkhuizen, The Netherlands. The new Gaura cultivar is characterized by a well-branched, compact habit, continuous flowering, green foliage and early to flower.",
        "The female (seed) parent of \u2018Gaudpin\u2019 was \u2018C0030-1,\u2019 an unpatented Gaura lindheimeri that is not known by any synonyms. The male (pollen) parent of \u2018Gaudpin\u2019 was \u2018C0029-1,\u2019 also an unpatented Gaura lindheimeri that is not known by any synonyms. \u2018Gaudpin\u2019 was selected in May 2001 as a single flowering plant from within the F1 plants of the above stated cross and was initially designated \u2018D0042-1.\u2019",
        "Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar at Enkhuizen, The Netherlands and Sarrians, France was carried out by the use of terminal stem cuttings, and has demonstrated that the new variety is stable and reproduces true to type in successive generations of asexual reproduction.",
        "It was found that the cultivar of the present invention:\n\n    \n    \n        a) Exhibits white flowers with a pink edge;\n        b) Forms green foilage; and\n        c) Exhibits an upright and very well branched growth habit.",
        "This new Gaura plant is illustrated by the accompanying photographic drawing which shows blooms, buds and foliage of the plant in full color, the color shown being as true as can be reasonably obtained by conventional photographic procedures.",
        "The following detailed descriptions set forth the distinctive characteristics of this new Gaura. The data which defines these characteristics were collected from asexual reproductions carried out in Enkhuizen, Netherlands. The plant history was taken on 16 week old plants blossomed under natural light in a greenhouse and grown in a 13 cm container.",
        "Color readings were taken in the greenhouse under ambient light. Color references are primarily to the R.H.S. Colour Chart of The Royal Horticultural Society of London.",
