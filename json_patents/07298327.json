    "abstract": "A location system is disclosed for commercial wireless telecommunication infrastructures. The system is an end-to-end solution having one or more location centers for outputting requested locations of commercially available handsets or mobile stations (MS) based on, e.g., CDMA, AMPS, NAMPS or TDMA communication standards, for processing both local MS location requests and more global MS location requests via, e.g., Internet communication between a distributed network of location centers. The system uses a plurality of MS locating technologies including those based on: (1) two-way TOA and TDOA; (2) pattern recognition; (3) distributed antenna provisioning; and (4) supplemental information from various types of very low cost non-infrastructure base stations for communicating via a typical commercial wireless base station infrastructure or a public telephone switching network. Accordingly, the traditional MS location difficulties, such as multipath, poor location accuracy and poor coverage are alleviated via such technologies in combination with strategies for: (a) automatically adapting and calibrating system performance according to environmental and geographical changes; (b) automatically capturing location signal data for continual enhancement of a self-maintaining historical data base retaining predictive location signal data; (c) evaluating MS locations according to both heuristics and constraints related to, e.g., terrain, MS velocity and MS path extrapolation from tracking and (d) adjusting likely MS locations adaptively and statistically so that the system becomes progressively more comprehensive and accurate. Further, the system can be modularly configured for use in location signaling environments ranging from urban, dense urban, suburban, rural, mountain to low traffic or isolated roadways. Accordingly, the system is useful for 911 emergency calls, tracking, routing, people and animal location including applications for confinement to and exclusion from certain areas.",

        "The present invention is directed generally to a system and method for locating people or objects, and in particular, to a system and method for locating a wireless mobile station using a plurality of simultaneously activated mobile station location estimators.",
        "Introduction",
        "Wireless communications systems are becoming increasingly important worldwide. Wireless cellular telecommunications systems are rapidly replacing conventional wire-based telecommunications systems in many applications. Cellular radio telephone networks (\u201cCRT\u201d), and specialized mobile radio and mobile data radio networks are examples. The general principles of wireless cellular telephony have been described variously, for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,295,180 to Vendetti, et al, which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "There is great interest in using existing infrastructures for wireless communication systems for locating people and/or objects in a cost effective manner. Such a capability would be invaluable in a variety of situations, especially in emergency or crime situations. Due to the substantial benefits of such a location system, several attempts have been made to design and implement such a system.",
        "Systems have been proposed that rely upon signal strength and trilateralization techniques to permit location include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,818,998 and 4,908,629 to Apsell et al. (\u201cthe Apsell patents\u201d) and 4,891,650 to Sheffer (\u201cthe Sheffer patent\u201d). However, these systems have drawbacks that include high expense in that special purpose electronics are required. Furthermore, the systems are generally only effective in line-of-sight conditions, such as rural settings. Radio wave surface reflections, refractions and ground clutter cause significant distortion, in determining the location of a signal source in most geographical areas that are more than sparsely populated. Moreover, these drawbacks are particularly exacerbated in dense urban canyon (city) areas, where errors and/or conflicts in location measurements can result in substantial inaccuracies.",
        "Another example of a location system using time of arrival and triangulation for location are satellite-based systems, such as the military and commercial versions of the Global Positioning Satellite system (\u201cGPS\u201d). GPS can provide accurate position determination (i.e., about 100 meters error for the commercial version of GPS) from a time-based signal received simultaneously from at least three satellites. A ground-based GPS receiver at or near the object to be located determines the difference between the time at which each satellite transmits a time signal and the time at which the signal is received and, based on the time differentials, determines the object's location. However, the GPS is impractical in many applications. The signal power levels from the satellites are low and the GPS receiver requires a clear, line-of-sight path to at least three satellites above a horizon of about 60 degrees for effective operation. Accordingly, inclement weather conditions, such as clouds, terrain features, such as hills and trees, and buildings restrict the ability of the GPS receiver to determine its position. Furthermore, the initial GPS signal detection process for a GPS receiver is relatively long (i.e., several minutes) for determining the receiver's position. Such delays are unacceptable in many applications such as, for example, emergency response and vehicle tracking.",
        "Differential GPS, or DGPS systems offer correction schemes to account for time synchronization drift. Such correction schemes include the transmission of correction signals over a two-way radio link or broadcast via FM radio station subcarriers. These systems have been found to be awkward and have met with limited success.",
        "Additionally, GPS-based location systems have been attempted in which the received GPS signals are transmitted to a central data center for performing location calculations. Such systems have also met with limited success. In brief, each of the various GPS embodiments have the same fundamental problems of limited reception of the satellite signals and added expense and complexity of the electronics required for an inexpensive location mobile station or handset for detecting and receiving the GPS signals from the satellites.",
        "Radio Propagation Background",
        "The behavior of a mobile radio signal in the general environment is unique and complicated. Efforts to perform correlations between radio signals and distance between a base station and a mobile station are similarly complex. Repeated attempts to solve this problem in the past have been met with only marginal success. Factors include terrain undulations, fixed and variable clutter, atmospheric conditions, internal radio characteristics of cellular and PCS systems, such as frequencies, antenna configurations, modulation schemes, diversity methods, and the physical geometries of direct, refracted and reflected waves between the base stations and the mobile. Noise, such as man-made externally sources (e.g., auto ignitions) and radio system co-channel and adjacent channel interference also affect radio reception and related performance measurements, such as the analog carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I), or digital energy-per-bit/Noise density ratio (Eb/No) and are particular to various points in time and space domains.",

No. 5,055,851 to Sheffer taught that if three or more relationships have been established in a triangular space of three or more base stations (BSs) with a location database constructed having data related to possible mobile station (MS) locations, then arculation calculations may be performed, which use three distinct Por measurements to determine an X,Y, two dimensional location, which can then be projected onto an area map. The triangulation calculation is based on the fact that the approximate distance of the mobile station (MS) from any base station (BS) cell can be calculated based on the received signal strength. Sheffer acknowledges that terrain variations affect accuracy, although as noted above, Sheffer's disclosure does not account for a sufficient number of variables, such as fixed and variable location shadow fading, which are typical in dense urban areas with moving traffic.",

Later, multi-ray models were proposed, and much later, certain behaviors were studied with radio and digital channels. In 1981, Vogler proposed that radio waves at higher frequencies could be modeled using optics principles. In 1988 Walfisch and Bertoni applied optical methods to develop a two-ray model, which when compared to certain highly specific, controlled field data, provided extremely good regression fit standard errors of within 1.2 dB.",

        "However, a substantial difficulty with the two-ray model in practice is that it requires a substantial amount of data regarding building dimensions, geometries, street widths, antenna gain characteristics for every possible ray path, etc. Additionally, it requires an inordinate amount of computational resources and such a model is not easily updated or maintained.",
        "Unfortunately, in practice clutter geometries and building heights are random. Moreover, data of sufficient detail has been extremely difficult to acquire, and regression standard fit errors are poor; i.e., in the general case, these errors were found to be 40\u201360 dB. Thus the two-ray model approach, although sometimes providing an improvement over single ray techniques, still did not predict RF signal characteristics in the general case to level of accuracy desired (<10 dB).",
        "Work by Greenstein has since developed from the perspective of measurement-based regression models, as opposed to the previous approach of predicting-first, then performing measurement comparisons. Apparently yielding to the fact that low-power, low antenna (e.g., 12\u201325 feet above ground) height PCS microcell coverage was insufficient in urban buildings, Greenstein, et al, authored \u201cPerformance Evaluations for Urban Line-of-sight Microcells Using a Multi-ray Propagation Model\u201d, in IEEE Globecom Proceedings, December 1991. This paper proposed the idea of formulating regressions based on field measurements using small PCS microcells in a lineal microcell geometry (i.e., geometries in which there is always a line-of-sight (LOS) path between a subscriber's mobile and its current microsite).",
        "Additionally, Greenstein studied the communication channels variable Bit-Error-Rate (BER) in a spatial domain, which was a departure from previous research that limited field measurements to the RF propagation channel signal strength alone. However, Greenstein based his finding on two suspicious assumptions: 1) he assumed that distance correlation estimates were identical for uplink and downlink transmission paths; and 2) modulation techniques would be transparent in terms of improved distance correlation conclusions. Although some data held very correlations, other data and environments produced poor results. Accordingly, his results appear unreliable for use in general location context.",
        "In 1993 Greenstein, et al, authored \u201cA Measurement-Based Model for Predicting Coverage Areas of Urban Microcells\u201d, in the IEEE Journal On Selected Areas in Communications, Vol. 11, No. 7, September 1993. Greenstein reported a generic measurement-based model of RF attenuation in terms of constant-value contours surrounding a given low-power, low antenna microcell environment in a dense, rectilinear neighborhood, such as New York City. However, these contours were for the cellular frequency band. In this case, LOS and non-LOS clutter were considered for a given microcell site. A result of this analysis was that RF propagation losses (or attenuations), when cell antenna heights were relatively low, provided attenuation contours resembling a spline plane curve depicted as an asteroid, aligned with major street grid patterns. Further, Greenstein found that convex diamond-shaped RF propagation loss contours were a common occurrence in field measurements in a rectilinear urban area. The special plane curve asteroid is represented by the formula x2/3+y2/3=r2/3. However, these results alone have not been sufficiently robust and general to accurately locate an MS, due to the variable nature of urban clutter spatial arrangements.",
        "At Telesis Technology in 1994 Howard Xia, et al, authored \u201cMicrocellular Propagation Characteristics for Personal Communications in Urban and Suburban Environments\u201d, in IEEE Transactions of Vehicular Technology, Vol. 43, No. 3, August 1994, which performed measurements specifically in the PCS 1.8 to 1.9 GHz frequency band. Xia found corresponding but more variable outcome results in San Francisco, Oakland (urban) and the Sunset and Mission Districts (suburban).",
        "Summary of Factors Affecting RF Propagation",
        "The physical radio propagation channel perturbs signal strength, frequency (causing rate changes, phase delay, signal to noise ratios (e.g., C/I for the analog case, or Eb/NO, RF energy per bit, over average noise density ratio for the digital case) and Doppler-shift. Signal strength is usually characterized by:\n\n    \n    \n        Free Space Path Loss (Lp)\n        Slow fading loss or margin (Lslow)\n        Fast fading loss or margin (Lfast)",
        "Loss due to slow fading includes shadowing due to clutter blockage (sometimes included in Lp). Fast fading is composed of multipath reflections which cause: 1) delay spread; 2) random phase shift or Rayleigh fading; and 3) random frequency modulation due to different Doppler shifts on different paths.",
        "Summing the path loss and the two fading margin loss components from the above yields a total path loss of:\n\nLtotal=Lp+Lslow+Lfast\n\nReferring to FIG. 3, the figure illustrates key components of a typical cellular and PCS power budget design process. The cell designer increases the transmitted power PTX by the shadow fading margin Lslow which is usually chosen to be within the 1\u20132 percentile of the slow fading probability density function (PDF) to minimize the probability of unsatisfactorily low received power level PRX at the receiver. The PRX level must have enough signal to noise energy level (e.g., 10 dB) to overcome the receiver's internal noise level (e.g. \u2212118 dBm in the case of cellular 0.9 GHz), for a minimum voice quality standard. Thus in the example PRX must never be below \u2212108 dBm, in order to maintain the quality standard.",
        "Additionally the short term fast signal fading due to multipath propagation is taken into account by deploying fast fading margin Lfast, which is typically also chosen to be a few percentiles of the fast fading distribution. The 1 to 2 percentiles compliment other network blockage guidelines. For example the cell base station traffic loading capacity and network transport facilities are usually designed for a 1\u20132 percentile blockage factor as well. However, in the worst-case scenario both fading margins are simultaneously exceeded, thus causing a fading margin overload.",
        "In Roy, Steele's, text, Mobile Radio Communications, IEEE Press, 1992, estimates for a GSM system operating in the 1.8 GHz band with a transmitter antenna height of 6.4 m and an MS receiver antenna height of 2 m, and assumptions regarding total path loss, transmitter power would be calculated as follows:",
        "TABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGSM Power Budget Example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\ndBm value\nWill require\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLslow\n14\n\n\n\n\nLfast\n7\n\n\n\nL1path\n110\n\n\n\nMin. RX pwr required\n\u2212104\n\n\n\n\n\nTX pwr = 27 dBm",
        "Steele's sample size in a specific urban London area of 80,000 LOS measurements and data reduction found a slow fading variance of\n\n\u03c3=7 dB\n\nassuming log normal slow fading PDF and allowing for a 1.4% slow fading margin overload, thus\n\nLslow=2\u03c3=14 dB",
        "The fast fading margin was determined to be:\n\nLfast=7 dB",
        "In contrast, Xia's measurements in urban and suburban California at 1.8 GHz uncovered flat-land shadow fades on the order of 25\u201330 dB when the mobile station (MS) receiver was traveling from LOS to non-LOS geometries. In hilly terrain fades of +5 to \u221250 dB were experienced. Thus it is evident that attempts to correlate signal strength with MS ranging distance suggest that error ranges could not be expected to improve below 14 dB, with a high side of 25 to 50 dB. Based on 20 to 40 dB per decade, Corresponding error ranges for the distance variable would then be on the order of 900 feet to several thousand feet, depending upon the particular environmental topology and the transmitter and receiver geometries.",

        "Yet another objective is to provide location estimates in terms of time vectors, which can be used to establish motion, speed, and an extrapolated next location in cases where the MS signal subsequently becomes unavailable.",
        "Definitions",
        "The following definitions are provided for convenience. In general, the definitions here are also defined elsewhere in this document as well.\n\n    (3.1) The term \u201cwireless\u201d herein is, in general, an abbreviation for \u201cdigital wireless\u201d, and in particular, \u201cwireless\u201d refers to digital radio signaling using one of standard digital protocols such as CDMA, NAMPS, AMPS, TDMA and GSM, as one skilled in the art will understand.\n    (3.2) As used herein, the term \u201cmobile station\u201d (equivalently, MS) refers to a wireless device that is at least a transmitting device, and in most cases is also a wireless receiving device, such as a portable radio telephony handset. Note that in some contexts herein instead or in addition to MS, the following terms are also used: \u201cpersonal station\u201d (PS), and \u201clocation unit\u201d (LU). In general, these terms may be considered synonymous. However, the later two terms may be used when referring to reduced functionality communication devices in comparison to a typical digital wireless mobile telephone.\n    (3.3) The term, \u201cinfrastructure\u201d, denotes the network of telephony communication services, and more particularly, that portion of such a network that receives and processes wireless communications with wireless mobile stations. In particular, this infrastructure includes telephony wireless base stations (BS) such as those for radio mobile communication systems based on CDMA, AMPS, NAMPS, TDMA, and GSM wherein the base stations provide a network of cooperative communication channels with an air interface with the MS, and a conventional telecommunications interface with a Mobile Switch Center (MSC). Thus, an MS user within an area serviced by the base stations may be provided with wireless communication throughout the area by user transparent communication transfers (i.e., \u201chandoffs\u201d) between the user's MS and these base stations in order to maintain effective telephony service. The mobile switch center (MSC) provides communications and control connectivity among base stations and the public telephone network 124.\n    (3.4) The phrase, \u201ccomposite wireless signal characteristic values\u201d denotes the result of aggregating and filtering a collection of measurements of wireless signal samples, wherein these samples are obtained from the wireless communication between an MS to be located and the base station infrastructure (e.g., a plurality of networked base stations). However, other phrases are also used herein to denote this collection of derived characteristic values depending on the context and the likely orientation of the reader. For example, when viewing these values from a wireless signal processing perspective of radio engineering, as in the descriptions of the subsequent Detailed Description sections concerned with the aspects of the present invention for receiving MS signal measurements from the base station infrastructure, the phrase typically used is: \u201cRF signal measurements\u201d. Alternatively, from a data processing perspective, the phrases: \u201clocation signature cluster\u201d and \u201clocation signal data\u201d are used to describe signal characteristic values between the MS and the plurality of infrastructure base stations substantially simultaneously detecting MS transmissions. Moreover, since the location communications between an MS and the base station infrastructure typically include simultaneous communications with more than one base station, a related useful notion is that of a \u201clocation signature\u201d which is the composite wireless signal characteristic values for signal samples between an MS to be located and a single base station. Also, in some contexts, the phrases: \u201csignal characteristic values\u201d or \u201csignal characteristic data\u201d are used when either or both a location signature(s) and/or a location signature cluster(s) are intended.\n\nSummary Discussion",
        "The objects set forth above are provided by the multiple model architecture disclosed herein. In particular, this multiple model architecture provides a plurality of computational models, wherein two or more such models may be activated to evaluate or assess a common situation or problem so that a result derived using the outputs from each of these models better addresses the situation or problem than any single one of the two or more models. The multiple model architecture may combine (and/or resolve differences between) the outputs of the activated models for thereby obtaining results that are enhanced over any single one of the models. The combining (and/or resolving) of the model outputs may utilize performance metrics or confidence factors indicative of the likelihood that the model outputs (also referred to as hypotheses herein) are accurate. The output model hypotheses may be determined using computational techniques that are, e.g., based on prior collected data from previously evaluated or assessed situations or problems. Additionally, such computational techniques may use prior collected data indicative of actual results for comparing with (and/or adjusting) model hypotheses.

For a detailed description of an embodiment of the multiple model architecture, much of the disclosure hereinbelow is directed to determining geographical locations of networked communication devices as in (i) above, and in particular, to wireless location.

        "Regarding a wireless location gateway, this term refers to a communications network node whereat a plurality of location requests are received for locating various mobile stations from various sources (e.g., for E911 requests, for stolen vehicle location, for tracking of vehicles traveling cross country, etc.), and for each such request and the corresponding mobile station to be located, this node: (a) activates one or more wireless location estimators for locating the mobile station, (b) receives one or more location estimates of the mobile station from the location estimators, and (c) transmits a resulting location estimate(s) to, e.g., an application which made the request. Moreover, such a gateway typically will likely activate location estimators according to the particulars of each individual wireless location request, e.g., the availability of input data needed by particular location estimators. Additionally, such a gateway will typically have sufficiently well defined uniform interfaces so that such location estimators can be added and/or deleted to, e.g., provide different location estimators for performing wireless location different coverage areas.",
        "The present invention encompasses such wireless location gateways. Thus, for locating an identified mobile station, the location gateway embodiments of the present invention may activate one or more of a plurality of location estimators depending on, e.g., (a) the availability of particular types of wireless location data for locating the mobile station, and (b) the location estimators accessable by the location gateway. Moreover, a plurality of location estimators may be activated for locating the mobile station in a single location, or different ones of such location estimators may be activated to locate the mobile station at different locations. Moreover, the location gateway of the present invention may have incorporated therein one or more of the location estimators, and/or may access geographically distributed location estimators via requests through a communications network such as the Internet.",
        "In particular, the location gateway of the present invention may access, in various instances of locating mobile stations, various location estimators that utilize one or more of the following wireless location techniques:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) A GPS location technique such as, e.g., one of the GPS location techniques as described in the Background section hereinabove;\n        (b) A technique for computing a mobile station location that is dependent upon geographical offsets of the mobile station from one or more terrestrial transceivers (e.g., base stations of a commercial radio service provider). Such offsets may be determined from signal time delays between such transceivers and the mobile station, such as by time of arrival (TOA) and/or time difference of arrival (TDOA) techniques as is discussed further hereinbelow. Moreover, such offsets may be determined using both the forward and reverse wireless signal timing measurements of transmissions between the mobile station and such terrestrial transceivers. Additionally, such offsets may be directional offsets, wherein a direction is determined from such a transceiver to the mobile station;\n        (c) Various wireless signal pattern matching, associative, and/or stochastic techniques for performing comparisons and/or using a learned association between:\n        \n            (i) characteristics of wireless signals communicated between a mobile station to be located and a network of wireless transceivers (e.g., base stations), and\n            (ii) previously obtained sets of characteristics of wireless signals (from each of a plurality of locations), wherein each set was communicated, e.g., between a network of transceivers (e.g., the fixed location base stations of a commercial radio service provider), and, some one of the mobile stations available for communicating with the network;\n        \n        \n        (d) Indoor location techniques using a distributed antenna system;\n        (e) Techniques for locating a mobile station, wherein, e.g., wireless coverage areas of individual fixed location transceivers (e.g., fixed location base stations) are utilized for determining the mobile station's location (e.g., intersecting such coverage areas for determining a location);\n        (f) Location techniques that use communications from low power, low functionality base stations (denoted \u201clocation base stations\u201d); and\n        (g) Any other location techniques that may be deemed worthwhile to incorporate into an embodiment of the present invention.",
        "Accordingly, some embodiments of the present invention may be viewed as platforms for integrating wireless location techniques in that wireless location computational models (denoted \u201cfirst order models\u201d or \u201cFOMs\u201d hereinbelow) may be added and/or deleted from such embodiments of the invention without changing the interface to further downstream processes. That is, one aspect of the invention is the specification of a common data interface between such computational models and subsequent location processing such as processes for combining of location estimates, tracking mobile stations, and/or outputting location estimates to location requesting applications.",
        "Moreover, it should be noted that the present invention also encompasses various hybrid approaches to wireless location, wherein various combinations of two or more of the location techniques (a) through (g) immediately above may be used in locating a mobile station at substantially a single location. Thus, location information may be obtained from a plurality of the above location techniques for locating a mobile station, and the output from such techniques can be synergistically used for deriving therefrom an enhanced location estimate of the mobile station.",
        "It is a further aspect of the present invention that it may be used to wirelessly locate a mobile station: (a) from which a 911 emergency call is performed, (b) for tracking a mobile station (e.g., a truck traveling across country), (c) for routing a mobile station, and (d) locating people and/or animals, including applications for confinement to (and/or exclusion from) certain areas.",
        "It is a further aspect of the present invention that it may be decomposed into: (i) a first low level wireless signal processing subsystem for receiving, organizing and conditioning low level wireless signal measurements from a network of base stations cooperatively linked for providing wireless communications with mobile stations (MSs); and (ii) a second high level signal processing subsystem for performing high level data processing for providing most likelihood location estimates for mobile stations.",
        "Thus, the present invention may be considered as a novel signal processor that includes at least the functionality for the high signal processing subsystem mentioned hereinabove. Accordingly, assuming an appropriate ensemble of wireless signal measurements characterizing the wireless signal communications between a particular MS and a networked wireless base station infrastructure have been received and appropriately filtered of noise and transitory values (such as by an embodiment of the low level signal processing subsystem disclosed in a copending PCT patent application PCT/US97/15933 titled, \u201cWireless Location Using A Plurality of Commercial Network Infrastructures,\u201d by F. W. LeBlanc et al., filed Sep. 8, 1997 from which U.S. Pat. No. 6,236,365, filed Jul. 8, 1999 is the U.S. national counterpart; these two references being herein fully incorporated by reference), the present invention uses the output from such a low level signal processing system for determining a most likely location estimate of an MS.",
        "That is, once the following steps are appropriately performed (e.g., by the LeBlanc U.S. Pat. No. 6,236,365):\n\n    \n    \n        (4.1) receiving signal data measurements corresponding to wireless communications between an MS to be located (herein also denoted the \u201ctarget MS\u201d) and a wireless telephony infrastructure;\n        (4.2) organizing and processing the signal data measurements received from a given target MS and surrounding BSs so that composite wireless signal characteristic values may be obtained from which target MS location estimates may be subsequently derived. In particular, the signal data measurements are ensembles of samples from the wireless signals received from the target MS by the base station infrastructure, wherein these samples are subsequently filtered using analog and digital spectral filtering.\n\nthe present invention accomplishes the objectives mentioned above by the following steps:\n\n        (4.3) providing the composite signal characteristic values to one or more MS location hypothesizing computational models (also denoted herein as \u201cfirst order models\u201d and also \u201clocation estimating models\u201d), wherein each such model subsequently determines one or more initial estimates of the location of the target MS based on, for example, the signal processing techniques 2.1 through 2.3 above. Moreover, each of the models output MS location estimates having substantially identical data structures (each such data structure denoted a \u201clocation hypothesis\u201d). Additionally, each location hypothesis may also include a confidence value indicating the likelihood or probability that the target MS whose location is desired resides in a corresponding location estimate for the target MS;\n        (4.4) adjusting or modifying location hypotheses output by the models according to, for example, 2.4 through 2.6 above so that the adjusted location hypotheses provide better target MS location estimates. In particular, such adjustments are performed on both the target MS location estimates of the location hypotheses as well as their corresponding confidences; and\n        (4.4) subsequently computing a \u201cmost likely\u201d target MS location estimate for outputting to a location requesting application such as 911 emergency, the fire or police departments, taxi services, etc. Note that in computing the most likely target MS location estimate a plurality of location hypotheses may be taken into account. In fact, it is an important aspect of the present invention that the most likely MS location estimate is determined by computationally forming a composite MS location estimate utilizing such a plurality of location hypotheses so that, for example, location estimate similarities between location hypotheses can be effectively utilized.",
        "Referring now to (4.3) above, the filtered and aggregated wireless signal characteristic values are provided to a number of location hypothesizing models (denoted First Order Models, or FOMs), each of which yields a location estimate or location hypothesis related to the location of the target MS. In particular, there are location hypotheses for both providing estimates of where the target MS is likely to be and where the target MS is not likely to be. Moreover, it is an aspect of the present invention that confidence values of the location hypotheses are provided as a continuous range of real numbers from, e.g., \u22121 to 1, wherein the most unlikely areas for locating the target MS are given a confidence value of \u22121, and the most likely areas for locating the target MS are given a confidence value of 1. That is, confidence values that are larger indicate a higher likelihood that the target MS is in the corresponding MS estimated area, wherein \u22121 indicates that the target MS is absolutely NOT in the estimated area, 0 indicates a substantially neutral or unknown likelihood of the target MS being in the corresponding estimated area, and 1 indicates that the target MS is absolutely within the corresponding estimated area.",
        "Referring to (4.4) above, it is an aspect of the present invention to provide location hypothesis enhancing and evaluation techniques that can adjust target MS location estimates according to historical MS location data and/or adjust the confidence values of location hypotheses according to how consistent the corresponding target MS location estimate is: (a) with historical MS signal characteristic values, (b) with various physical constraints, and (c) with various heuristics. In particular, the following capabilities are provided by the present invention:\n\n    \n    \n        (5.1) a capability for enhancing the accuracy of an initial location hypothesis, H, generated by a first order model, FOMH, by using H as, essentially, a query or index into an historical data base (denoted herein as the location signature data base), wherein this data base includes: (a) a plurality of previously obtained location signature clusters (i.e., composite wireless signal characteristic values) such that for each such cluster there is an associated actual or verified MS locations where an MS communicated with the base station infrastructure for locating the MS, and (b) previous MS location hypothesis estimates from FOMH derived from each of the location signature clusters stored according to (a);\n        (5.2) a capability for analyzing composite signal characteristic values of wireless communications between the target MS and the base station infrastructure, wherein such values are compared with composite signal characteristics values of known MS locations (these latter values being archived in the location signature data base). In one instance, the composite signal characteristic values used to generate various location hypotheses for the target MS are compared against wireless signal data of known MS locations stored in the location signature data base for determining the reliability of the location hypothesizing models for particular geographic areas and/or environmental conditions;\n        (5.3) a capability for reasoning about the likeliness of a location hypothesis wherein this reasoning capability uses heuristics and constraints based on physics and physical properties of the location geography;\n        (5.4) an hypothesis generating capability for generating new location hypotheses from previous hypotheses.",
        "As also mentioned above in (2.3), the present invention utilizes adaptive signal processing techniques. One particularly important utilization of such techniques includes the automatic tuning of the present invention so that, e.g., such tuning can be applied to adjusting the values of location processing system parameters that affect the processing performed by the present invention. For example, such system parameters as those used for determining the size of a geographical area to be specified when retrieving location signal data of known MS locations from the historical (location signature) data base can substantially affect the location processing. In particular, a system parameter specifying a minimum size for such a geographical area may, if too large, cause unnecessary inaccuracies in locating an MS. Accordingly, to accomplish a tuning of such system parameters, an adaptation engine is included in the present invention for automatically adjusting or tuning parameters used by the present invention. Note that in one embodiment, the adaptation engine is based on genetic algorithm techniques.",
        "A novel aspect of the present invention relies on the discovery that in many areas where MS location services are desired, the wireless signal measurements obtained from communications between the target MS and the base station infrastructure are extensive enough to provide sufficiently unique or peculiar values so that the pattern of values alone may identify the location of the target MS. Further, assuming a sufficient amount of such location identifying pattern information is captured in the composite wireless signal characteristic values for a target MS, and that there is a technique for matching such wireless signal patterns to geographical locations, then a FOM based on this technique may generate a reasonably accurate target MS location estimate. Moreover, if the present invention (e.g., the location signature data base) has captured sufficient wireless signal data from location communications between MSs and the base station infrastructure wherein the locations of the MSs are also verified and captured, then this captured data (e.g., location signatures) can be used to train or calibrate such models to associate the location of a target MS with the distinctive signal characteristics between the target MS and one or more base stations. Accordingly, the present invention includes one or more FOMs that may be generally denoted as classification models wherein such FOMs are trained or calibrated to associate particular composite wireless signal characteristic values with a geographical location where a target MS could likely generate the wireless signal samples from which the composite wireless signal characteristic values are derived. Further, the present invention includes the capability for training (calibrating) and retraining (recalibrating) such classification FOMs to automatically maintain the accuracy of these models even though substantial changes to the radio coverage area may occur, such as the construction of a new high rise building or seasonal variations (due to, for example, foliage variations).",
        "Note that such classification FOMs that are trained or calibrated to identify target MS locations by the wireless signal patterns produced constitute a particularly novel aspect of the present invention. It is well known in the wireless telephony art that the phenomenon of signal multipath and shadow fading renders most analytical location computational techniques such as time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) substantially useless in urban areas and particularly in dense urban areas. However, this same multipath phenomenon also may produce substantially distinct or peculiar signal measurement patterns, wherein such a pattern coincides with a relatively small geographical area. Thus, the present invention utilizes multipath as an advantage for increasing accuracy where for previous location systems multipath has been a source of substantial inaccuracies. Moreover, it is worthwhile to note that the utilization of classification FOMs in high multipath environments is especially advantageous in that high multipath environments are typically densely populated. Thus, since such environments are also capable of yielding a greater density of MS location signal data from MSs whose actual locations can be obtained, there can be a substantial amount of training or calibration data captured by the present invention for training or calibrating such classification FOMs and for progressively improving the MS location accuracy of such models. Moreover, since it is also a related aspect of the present invention to include a plurality stationary, low cost, low power \u201clocation detection base stations\u201d (LBS), each having both restricted range MS detection capabilities and a built-in MS, a grid of such LBSs can be utilized for providing location signal data (from the built-in MS) for (re)training or (re)calibrating such classification FOMs.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, one or more classification FOMs may each include a learning module such as an artificial neural network (ANN) for associating target MS location signal data with a target MS location estimate. Additionally, one or more classification FOMs may be statistical prediction models based on such statistical techniques as, for example, principle decomposition, partial least squares, or other regression techniques.",
        "It is a further aspect of the present invention that the personal communication system (PCS) infrastructures currently being developed by telecommunication providers offer an appropriate localized infrastructure base upon which to build various personal location systems (PLS) employing the present invention and/or utilizing the techniques disclosed herein. In particular, the present invention is especially suitable for the location of people and/or objects using code division multiple access (CDMA) wireless infrastructures, although other wireless infrastructures, such as, time division multiple access (TDMA) infrastructures and GSM are also contemplated. Note that CDMA personal communications systems are described in the Telephone Industries Association standard IS-95, for frequencies below 1 GHz, and in the Wideband Spread-Spectrum Digital Cellular System Dual-Mode Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard, for frequencies in the 1.8\u20131.9 GHz frequency bands, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore, CDMA general principles have also been described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,109,390, to Gilhausen, et al, filed Nov. 7, 1989, and CDMA Network Engineering Handbook by Qualcomm, Inc., each of which is also incorporated herein by reference.",
        "Notwithstanding the above mentioned CDMA references, a brief introduction of CDMA is given here. Briefly, CDMA is an electromagnetic signal modulation and multiple access scheme based on spread spectrum communication. Each CDMA signal corresponds to an unambiguous pseudorandom binary sequence for modulating the carrier signal throughout a predetermined spectrum of bandwidth frequencies. Transmissions of individual CDMA signals are selected by correlation processing of a pseudonoise waveform. In particular, the CDMA signals are separately detected in a receiver by using a correlator, which accepts only signal energy from the selected binary sequence and despreads its spectrum. Thus, when a first CDMA signal is transmitted, the transmissions of unrelated CDMA signals correspond to pseudorandom sequences that do not match the first signal. Therefore, these other signals contribute only to the noise and represent a self-interference generated by the personal communications system.",
        "As mentioned in the discussion of classification FOMs above, the present invention can substantially automatically retrain and/or recalibrate itself to compensate for variations in wireless signal characteristics (e.g., multipath) due to environmental and/or topographic changes to a geographic area serviced by the present invention. For example, in one embodiment, the present invention optionally includes low cost, low power base stations, denoted location base stations (LBS) above, providing, for example, CDMA pilot channels to a very limited area about each such LBS. The location base stations may provide limited voice traffic capabilities, but each is capable of gathering sufficient wireless signal characteristics from an MS within the location base station's range to facilitate locating the MS. Thus, by positioning the location base stations at known locations in a geographic region such as, for instance, on street lamp poles and road signs, additional MS location accuracy can be obtained. That is, due to the low power signal output by such location base stations, for there to be signaling control communication (e.g., pilot signaling and other control signals) between a location base station and a target MS, the MS must be relatively near the location base station. Additionally, for each location base station not in communication with the target MS, it is likely that the MS is not near to this location base station. Thus, by utilizing information received from both location base stations in communication with the target MS and those that are not in communication with the target MS, the present invention can substantially narrow the possible geographic areas within which the target MS is likely to be. Further, by providing each location base station (LBS) with a co-located stationary wireless transceiver (denoted a built-in MS above) having similar functionality to an MS, the following advantages are provided:\n\n    (6.1) assuming that the co-located base station capabilities and the stationary transceiver of an LBS are such that the base station capabilities and the stationary transceiver communicate with one another, the stationary transceiver can be signaled by another component(s) of the present invention to activate or deactivate its associated base station capability, thereby conserving power for the LBS that operate on a restricted power such as solar electrical power;\n    (6.2) the stationary transceiver of an LBS can be used for transferring target MS location information obtained by the LBS to a conventional telephony base station;\n    (6.3) since the location of each LBS is known and can be used in location processing, the present invention is able to (re)train and/or (re)calibrate itself in geographical areas having such LBSs. That is, by activating each LBS stationary transceiver so that there is signal communication between the stationary transceiver and surrounding base stations within range, wireless signal characteristic values for the location of the stationary transceiver are obtained for each such base station. Accordingly, such characteristic values can then be associated with the known location of the stationary transceiver for training and/or calibrating various of the location processing modules of the present invention such as the classification FOMs discussed above. In particular, such training and/or calibrating may include:\n    \n        (i) (re)training and/or (re)calibrating FOMs;\n        (ii) adjusting the confidence value initially assigned to a location hypothesis according to how accurate the generating FOM is in estimating the location of the stationary transceiver using data obtained from wireless signal characteristics of signals between the stationary transceiver and base stations with which the stationary transceiver is capable of communicating;\n        (iii) automatically updating the previously mentioned historical data base (i.e., the location signature data base), wherein the stored signal characteristic data for each stationary transceiver can be used for detecting environmental and/or topographical changes (e.g., a newly built high rise or other structures capable of altering the multipath characteristics of a given geographical area); and\n        (iv) tuning of the location system parameters, wherein the steps of: (a) modifying various system parameters and (b) testing the performance of the modified location system on verified mobile station location data (including the stationary transceiver signal characteristic data), these steps being interleaved and repeatedly performed for obtaining better system location accuracy within useful time constraints.",
        "It is also an aspect of the present invention to automatically (re)calibrate as in (6.3) above with signal characteristics from other known or verified locations. In one embodiment of the present invention, portable location verifying electronics are provided so that when such electronics are sufficiently near a located target MS, the electronics: (i) detect the proximity of the target MS; (ii) determine a highly reliable measurement of the location of the target MS; (iii) provide this measurement to other location determining components of the present invention so that the location measurement can be associated and archived with related signal characteristic data received from the target MS at the location where the location measurement is performed. Thus, the use of such portable location verifying electronics allows the present invention to capture and utilize signal characteristic data from verified, substantially random locations for location system calibration as in (6.3) above. Moreover, it is important to note that such location verifying electronics can verify locations automatically wherein it is unnecessary for manual activation of a location verifying process.",
        "One embodiment of the present invention includes the location verifying electronics as a \u201cmobile (location) base station\u201d (MBS) that can be, for example, incorporated into a vehicle, such as an ambulance, police car, or taxi. Such a vehicle can travel to sites having a transmitting target MS, wherein such sites may be randomly located and the signal characteristic data from the transmitting target MS at such a location can consequently be archived with a verified location measurement performed at the site by the mobile location base station. Moreover, it is important to note that such a mobile location base station as its name implies also includes base station electronics for communicating with mobile stations, though not necessarily in the manner of a conventional infrastructure base station. In particular, a mobile location base station may only monitor signal characteristics, such as MS signal strength, from a target MS without transmitting signals to the target MS. Alternatively, a mobile location base station can periodically be in bi-directional communication with a target MS for determining a signal time-of-arrival (or time-difference-of-arrival) measurement between the mobile location base station and the target MS. Additionally, each such mobile location base station includes components for estimating the location of the mobile location base station, such mobile location base station location estimates being important when the mobile location base station is used for locating a target MS via, for example, time-of-arrival or time-difference-of-arrival measurements as one skilled in the art will appreciate. In particular, a mobile location base station can include:\n\n    (7.1) a mobile station (MS) for both communicating with other components of the present invention (such as a location processing center included in the present invention);\n    (7.2) a GPS receiver for determining a location of the mobile location base station;\n    (7.3) a gyroscope and other dead reckoning devices; and\n    (7.4) devices for operator manual entry of a mobile location base station location.",
        "Furthermore, a mobile location base station includes modules for integrating or reconciling distinct mobile location base station location estimates that, for example, can be obtained using the components and devices of(7.1) through (7.4) above. That is, location estimates for the mobile location base station may be obtained from: GPS satellite data, mobile location base station data provided by the location processing center, dead reckoning data obtained from the mobile location base station vehicle dead reckoning devices, and location data manually input by an operator of the mobile location base station.",
        "The location estimating system of the present invention offers many advantages over existing location systems. The system of the present invention, for example, is readily adaptable to existing wireless communication systems and can accurately locate people and!or objects in a cost effective manner. In particular, the present invention requires few, if any, modifications to commercial wireless communication systems for implementation. Thus, exiting personal communication system infrastructure base stations and other components of, for example, commercial CDMA infrastructures are readily adapted to the present invention. The present invention can be used to locate people and/or objects that are not in the line-of-sight of a wireless receiver or transmitter, can reduce the detrimental effects of multipath on the accuracy of the location estimate, can potentially locate people and/or objects located indoors as well as outdoors, and uses a number of wireless stationary transceivers for location. The present invention employs a number of distinctly different location computational models for location which provides a greater degree of accuracy, robustness and versatility than is possible with existing systems. For instance, the location models provided include not only the radius-radius/TOA and TDOA techniques but also adaptive artificial neural net techniques. Further, the present invention is able to adapt to the topography of an area in which location service is desired. The present invention is also able to adapt to environmental changes substantially as frequently as desired. Thus, the present invention is able to take into account changes in the location topography over time without extensive manual data manipulation. Moreover, the present invention can be utilized with varying amounts of signal measurement inputs. Thus, if a location estimate is desired in a very short time interval (e.g., less than approximately one to two seconds), then the present location estimating system can be used with only as much signal measurement data as is possible to acquire during an initial portion of this time interval. Subsequently, after a greater amount of signal measurement data has been acquired, additional more accurate location estimates may be obtained. Note that this capability can be useful in the context of 911 emergency response in that a first quick coarse wireless mobile station location estimate can be used to route a 911 call from the mobile station to a 911 emergency response center that has responsibility for the area containing the mobile station and the 911 caller. Subsequently, once the 911 call has been routed according to this first quick location estimate, by continuing to receive additional wireless signal measurements, more reliable and accurate location estimates of the mobile station can be obtained.",
        "Moreover, there are numerous additional advantages of the system of the present invention when applied in CDMA communication systems. The location system of the present invention readily benefits from the distinct advantages of the CDMA spread spectrum scheme, namely, these advantages include the exploitation of radio frequency spectral efficiency and isolation by (a) monitoring voice activity, (b) management of two-way power control, (c) provisioning of advanced variable-rate modems and error correcting signal encoding, (d) inherent resistance to fading, (e) enhanced privacy, and (f) multiple \u201crake\u201d digital data receivers and searcher receivers for correlation of signal multipaths.",
        "At a more general level, it is an aspect of the present invention to demonstrate the utilization of various novel computational paradigms such as:\n\n    (8.1) providing a multiple hypothesis computational architecture (as illustrated best in FIG. 8 and/or FIG. 13) wherein the hypotheses are:\n    \n        (8.1.1) generated by modular independent hypothesizing computational models;\n        (8.1.2) the models are embedded in the computational architecture in a manner wherein the architecture allows for substantial amounts of application specific processing common or generic to a plurality of the models to be straightforwardly incorporated into the computational architecture;\n        (8.1.3) the computational architecture enhances the hypotheses generated by the models both according to past performance of the models and according to application specific constraints and heuristics without requiring feedback loops for adjusting the models;\n        (8.1.4) the models are relatively easily integrated into, modified and extracted from the computational architecture;\n    \n    \n    (8.2) providing a computational paradigm for enhancing an initial estimated solution to a problem by using this initial estimated solution as, effectively, a query or index into an historical data base of previous solution estimates and corresponding actual solutions for deriving an enhanced solution estimate based on past performance of the module that generated the initial estimated solution.",
        "Note that the multiple hypothesis architecture provided herein is useful in implementing solutions in a wide range of applications. For example, the following additional applications are within the scope of the present invention:\n\n    (9.1) document scanning applications for transforming physical documents in to electronic forms of the documents. Note that in many cases the scanning of certain documents (books, publications, etc.) may have a 20% character recognition error rate. Thus, the novel computation architecture of the present invention can be utilized by (I) providing a plurality of document scanning models as the first order models, (ii) building a character recognition data base for archiving a correspondence between characteristics of actual printed character variations and the intended characters (according to, for example, font types), and additionally archiving a correspondence of performance of each of the models on previously encountered actual printed character variations (note, this is analogous to the Signature Data Base of the MS location application described herein), and (iii) determining any generic constraints and/or heuristics that are desirable to be satisfied by a plurality of the models. Accordingly, by comparing outputs from the first order document scanning models, a determination can be made as to whether further processing is desirable due to, for example, discrepancies between the output of the models. If further processing is desirable, then an embodiment of the multiple hypothesis architecture provided herein may be utilized to correct such discrepancies. Note that in comparing outputs from the first order document scanning models, these outputs may be compared at various granularities; e.g., character, sentence, paragraph or page;\n    (9.2) diagnosis and monitoring applications such as medical diagnosis/monitoring, communication network diagnosis/monitoring;\n    (9.3) robotics applications such as scene and/or object recognition;\n    (9.4) seismic and/or geologic signal processing applications such as for locating oil and gas deposits;\n    (9.5) Additionally, note that this architecture need not have all modules co-located. In particular, it is an additional aspect of the present invention that various modules can be remotely located from one another and communicate with one another via telecommunication transmissions such as telephony technologies and/or the Internet. Accordingly, the present invention is particularly adaptable to such distributed computing environments. For example, some number of the first order models may reside in remote locations and communicate their generated hypotheses via the Internet.",
        "For instance, in weather prediction applications it is not uncommon for computational models to require large amounts of computational resources. Thus, such models running at various remote computational facilities can transfer weather prediction hypotheses (e.g., the likely path of a hurricane) to a site that performs hypothesis adjustments according to: (i) past performance of the each model; (ii) particular constraints and/or heuristics, and subsequently outputs a most likely estimate for a particular weather condition.",
        "In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the processing following the generation of location hypotheses (each having an initial location estimate) by the first order models may be such that this processing can be provided on Internet user nodes and the first order models may reside at Internet server sites. In this configuration, an Internet user may request hypotheses from such remote first order models and perform the remaining processing at his/her node.",
        "In other embodiments of the present invention, a fast, albeit less accurate location estimate may be initially performed for very time critical location applications where approximate location information may be required. For example, less than 1 second response for a mobile station location embodiment of the present invention may be desired for 911 emergency response location requests. Subsequently, once a relatively coarse location estimate has been provided, a more accurate most likely location estimate can be performed by repeating the location estimation processing a second time with, e.g., additional with measurements of wireless signals transmitted between a mobile station to be located and a network of base stations with which the mobile station is communicating, thus providing a second, more accurate location estimate of the mobile station.",
        "Additionally, note that it is within the scope of the present invention to provide one or more central location development sites that may be networked to, for example, geographically dispersed location centers providing location services according to the present invention, wherein the FOMs may be accessed, substituted, enhanced or removed dynamically via network connections (via, e.g., the Internet) with a central location development site. Thus, a small but rapidly growing municipality in substantially flat low density area might initially be provided with access to, for example, two or three FOMs for generating location hypotheses in the municipality's relatively uncluttered radio signaling environment. However, as the population density increases and the radio signaling environment becomes cluttered by, for example, thermal noise and multipath, additional or alternative FOMs may be transferred via the network to the location center for the municipality.",
        "Note that in some embodiments of the present invention, since there is a lack of sequencing between the FOMs and subsequent processing of location hypotheses, the FOMs can be incorporated into an expert system, if desired. For example; each FOM may be activated from an antecedent of an expert system rule. Thus, the antecedent for such a rule can evaluate to TRUE if the FOM outputs a location hypothesis, and the consequent portion of such a rule may put the output location hypothesis on a list of location hypotheses occurring in a particular time window for subsequent processing by the location center. Alternatively, activation of the FOMs may be in the consequents of such expert system rules. That is, the antecedent of such an expert system rule may determine if the conditions are appropriate for invoking the FOM(s) in the rule's consequent.",
        "Of course, other software architectures may also to used in implementing the processing of the location center without departing from scope of the present invention. In particular, object-oriented architectures are also within the scope of the present invention. For example, the FOMs may be object methods on an MS location estimator object, wherein the estimator object receives substantially all target MS location signal data output by the signal filtering subsystem. Alternatively, software bus architectures are contemplated by the present invention, as one skilled in the art will understand, wherein the software architecture may be modular and facilitate parallel processing.",

        "Detailed Description Introduction",
        "Various digital wireless communication standards have been introduced such as Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS), Narrowband Advanced Mobile Phone Service (NAMPS), code division multiple access (CDMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) (e.g., Global Systems Mobile (GSM). These standards provide numerous enhancements for advancing the quality and communication capacity for wireless applications. Referring to CDMA, this standard is described in the Telephone Industries Association standard IS-95, for frequencies below 1 GHz, and in J-STD-008, the Wideband Spread-Spectrum Digital Cellular System Dual-Mode Mobile Station-Base station Compatibility Standard, for frequencies in the 1.8\u20131.9 GHz frequency bands. Additionally, CDMA general principles have been described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,109,390, Diversity Receiver in a CDMA Cellular Telephone System by Gilhousen. There are numerous advantages of such digital wireless technologies such as CDMA radio technology. For example, the CDMA spread spectrum scheme exploits radio frequency spectral efficiency and isolation by monitoring voice activity, managing two-way power control, provision of advanced variable-rate modems and error correcting signal design, and includes inherent resistance to fading, enhanced privacy, and provides for multiple \u201crake\u201d digital data receivers and searcher receivers for correlation of multiple physical propagation paths, resembling maximum likelihood detection, as well as support for multiple base station communication with a mobile station, i.e., soft or softer hand-off capability. When coupled with a location center as described herein, substantial improvements in radio location can be achieved. For example, the CDMA spread spectrum scheme exploits radio frequency spectral efficiency and isolation by monitoring voice activity, managing two-way power control, provision of advanced variable-rate modems and error correcting signal design, and includes inherent resistance to fading, enhanced privacy, and provides for multiple \u201crake\u201d digital data receivers and searcher receivers for correlation of multiple physical propagation paths, resembling maximum likelihood detection, as well as support for multiple base station communication with a mobile station, i.e., soft hand-off capability. Moreover, this same advanced radio communication infrastructure can also be used for enhanced radio location. As a further example, the capabilities of IS-41 and AIN already provide a broad-granularity of wireless location, as is necessary to, for example, properly direct a terminating call to an MS. Such information, originally intended for call processing usage, can be re-used in conjunction with the location center described herein to provide wireless location in the large (i.e., to determine which country, state and city a particular MS is located) and wireless location in the small (i.e., which location, plus or minus a few hundred feet within one or more base stations a given MS is located).",
        "FIG. 4 is a high level diagram of a wireless digital radio location intelligent network architecture for the present invention. Accordingly, this figure illustrates the interconnections between the components, for example, of a typical PCS network configuration and various components that are specific to the present invention. In particular, as one skilled in the art will understand, a typical wireless (PCS) network includes:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) a (large) plurality of conventional wireless mobile stations (MSs) 140 for at least one of voice related communication, visual (e.g., text) related communication, and according to present invention, location related communication;\n        (b) a mobile switching center (MSC) 112;\n        (c) a plurality of wireless cell sites in a radio coverage area 120, wherein each cell site includes an infrastructure base station such as those labeled 122 (or variations thereof such as 122A-122D). In particular, the base stations 122 denote the standard high traffic, fixed location base stations used for voice and data communication with a plurality of MSs 140, and, according to the present invention, also used for communication of information related to locating such MSs 140. Additionally, note that the base stations labeled 152 are more directly related to wireless location enablement. For example, as described in greater detail hereinbelow, the base stations 152 may be low cost, low functionality transponders that are used primarily in communicating MS location related information to the location center 142 (via base stations 122 and the MSC 112). Note that unless stated otherwise, the base stations 152 will be referred to hereinafter as \u201clocation base station(s) 152\u201d or simply \u201cLBS(s) 152\u201d);\n        (d) a public switched telephone network (PSTN) 124 (which may include signaling system links 106 having network control components such as: a service control point (SCP) 104, one or more signaling transfer points (STPs) 110.",
        "Added to this wireless network, the present invention provides the following additional components:\n\n    (10.1) a location center 142 which is required for determining a location of a target MS 140 using signal characteristic values for this target MS;\n    (10.2) one or more mobile base stations 148 (MBS) which are optional, for physically traveling toward the target MS 140 or tracking the target MS;\n    (10.3) a plurality of location base stations 152 (LBS) which are optional, distributed within the radio coverage areas 120, each LBS 152 having a relatively small MS 140 detection area 154;",
        "Since location base stations can be located on potentially each floor of a multi-story building, the wireless location technology described herein can be used to perform location in terms of height as well as by latitude and longitude.",
        "In operation, the MS 140 may utilize one of the wireless technologies, CDMA, TDMA, AMPS, NAMPS or GSM techniques for radio communication with: (a) one or more infrastructure base stations 122, (b) mobile base station(s) 148, (c) an LBS 152.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4 again, additional detail is provided of typical base station coverage areas, sectorization, and high level components within a radio coverage area 120, including the MSC 112. Although base stations may be placed in any configuration, a typical deployment configuration is approximately in a cellular honeycomb pattern, although many practical tradeoffs exist, such as site availability, versus the requirement for maximal terrain coverage area. To illustrate, three such exemplary base stations (BSs) are 122A, 122B and 122C, each of which radiate referencing signals within their area of coverage 169 to facilitate mobile station (MS) 140 radio frequency connectivity, and various timing and synchronization functions. Note that some base stations may contain no sectors 130 (e.g. 122E), thus radiating and receiving signals in a 360 degree omnidirectional coverage area pattern, or the base station may contain \u201csmart antennas\u201d which have specialized coverage area patterns. However, the generally most frequent base stations 122 have three sector 130 coverage area patterns. For example, base station 122A includes sectors 130, additionally labeled a, b and c. Accordingly, each of the sectors 130 radiate and receive signals in an approximate 120 degree arc, from an overhead view. As one skilled in the art will understand, actual base station coverage areas 169 (stylistically represented by hexagons about the base stations 122) generally are designed to overlap to some extent, thus ensuring seamless coverage in a geographical area. Control electronics within each base station 122 are used to communicate with a mobile stations 140. Information regarding the coverage area for each sector 130, such as its range, area, and \u201choles\u201d or areas of no coverage (within the radio coverage area 120), may be known and used by the location center 142 to facilitate location determination. Further, during communication with a mobile station 140, the identification of each base station 122 communicating with the MS 140 as well, as any sector identification information, may be known and provided to the location center 142.",
        "In the case of the base station types 122,148, and 152 communication of location information, a base station or mobility controller 174 (BSC) controls, processes and provides an interface between originating and terminating telephone calls from/to mobile station (MS) 140, and the mobile switch center (MSC) 112. The MSC 122, on-the-other-hand, performs various administration functions such as mobile station 140 registration, authentication and the relaying of various system parameters, as one skilled in the art will understand.",
        "The base stations 122 may be coupled by various transport facilities 176 such as leased lines, frame relay, T-Carrier links, optical fiber links or by microwave communication links.",
        "When a mobile station 140 (such as a CDMA, AMPS, NAMPS mobile telephone) is powered on and in the idle state, it constantly monitors the pilot signal transmissions from each of the base stations 122 located at nearby cell sites. Since base station/sector coverage areas may often overlap, such overlapping enables mobile stations 140 to detect, and, in the case of certain wireless technologies, communicate simultaneously along both the forward and reverse paths, with multiple base stations 122 and/or sectors 130. In FIG. 4 the constantly radiating pilot signals from base station sectors 130, such as sectors a, b and c of BS 122A, are detectable by mobile stations 140 within the coverage area 169 for BS 122A. That is, the mobile stations 140 scan for pilot channels, corresponding to a given base station/sector identifiers (IDs), for determining which coverage area 169 (i.e., cell) it is contained. This is performed by comparing signals strengths of pilot signals transmitted from these particular cell-sites.",
        "The mobile station 140 then initiates a registration request with the MSC 112, via the base station controller 174. The MSC 112 determines whether or not the mobile station 140 is allowed to proceed with the registration process (except in the case of a 911 call, wherein no registration process is required). At this point calls may be originated from the mobile station 140 or calls or short message service messages can be received from the network. The MSC 112 communicates as appropriate, with a class \u2158 wireline telephony circuit switch or other central offices, connected to the PSTN 124 network. Such central offices connect to wireline terminals, such as telephones, or any communication device compatible with the line. The PSTN 124 may also provide connections to long distance networks and other networks.",
        "The MSC 112 may also utilize IS/41 data circuits or trunks connecting to signal transfer point 110, which in turn connects to a service control point 104, via Signaling System #7 (SS7) signaling links (e.g., trunks) for intelligent call processing, as one skilled in the art will understand. In the case of wireless AIN services such links are used for call routing instructions of calls interacting with the MSC 112 or any switch capable of providing service switching point functions, and the public switched telephone network (PSTN) 124, with possible termination back to the wireless network.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4 again, the location center (LC) 142 interfaces with the MSC 112 either via dedicated transport facilities 178, using for example, any number of LAN/WAN technologies, such as Ethernet, fast Ethernet, frame relay, virtual private networks, etc., or via the PSTN 124. The LC 142 receives autonomous (e.g., unsolicited) command/response messages regarding, for example: (a) the state of the wireless network of each service provider, (b) MS 140 and BS 122 radio frequency (RF) measurements, (c) any MBSs 148, (d) location applications requesting MS locations using the location center. Conversely, the LC 142 provides data and control information to each of the above components in (a)\u2013(d). Additionally, the LC 142 may provide location information to an MS 140, via a BS 122. Moreover, in the case of the use of a mobile base station (MBS) 148, several communications paths may exist with the LC 142.",
        "The MBS 148 acts as a low cost, partially-functional, moving base station, and is, in one embodiment, situated in a vehicle where an operator may engage in MS 140 searching and tracking activities. In providing these activities using CDMA, the MBS 148 provides a forward link pilot channel for a target MS 140, and subsequently receives unique BS pilot strength measurements from the MS 140. The MBS 148 also includes a mobile station for data communication with the LC 142, via a BS 122. In particular, such data communication includes telemetering the geographic position of the MBS 148 as well as various RF measurements related to signals received from the target MS 140. In some embodiments, the MBS 148 may also utilize multiple-beam fixed antenna array elements and/or a moveable narrow beam antenna, such as a microwave dish 182. The antennas for such embodiments may have a known orientation in order to further deduce a radio location of the target MS 140 with respect to an estimated current location of the MBS 148. As will be described in more detail herein below, the MBS 148 may further contain a global positioning system (GPS), distance sensors, dead reckoning electronics, as well as an on-board computing system and display devices for locating both the MBS 148 itself as well as tracking and locating the target MS 140. The computing and display provides a means for communicating the position of the target MS 140 on a map display to an operator of the MBS 148.",
        "Each location base station (LBS) 152 is a low cost location device. Each such LBS 152 communicates with one or more of the infrastructure base stations 122 using one or more wireless technology interface standards. In some embodiments, to provide such LBS's cost effectively, each LBS 152 only partially or minimally supports the air-interface standards of the one or more wireless technologies used in communicating with both the BSs 122 and the MSs 140. Each LBS 152, when put in service, is placed at a fixed location, such as at a traffic signal, lamp post, etc., and wherein the location of the LBS may be determined as accurately as, for example, the accuracy of the locations of the infrastructure BSs 122. Assuming the wireless technology CDMA is used, each BS 122 uses a time offset of the pilot PN sequence to identify a forward CDMA pilot channel. In one embodiment, each LBS 152 emits a unique, time-offset pilot PN sequence channel in accordance with the CDMA standard in the RF spectrum designated for BSs 122, such that the channel does not interfere with neighboring BSs 122 cell site channels, nor would it interfere with neighboring LBSs 152. However, as one skilled in the art will understand, time offsets, in CDMA chip sizes, may be re-used within a PCS system, thus providing efficient use of pilot time offset chips, thereby achieving spectrum efficiency. Each LBS 152 may also contain multiple wireless receivers in order to monitor transmissions from a target MS 140. Additionally, each LBS 152 contains mobile station 140 electronics, thereby allowing the LBS to both be controlled by the LC 142, and to transmit information to the LC 142, via at least one neighboring BS 122.",
        "As mentioned above, when the location of a particular target MS 140 is desired, the LC 142 can request location information about the target MS 140 from, for instance, one or more activated LBSs 152 in a geographical area of interest. Accordingly, whenever the target MS 140 is in such an area, or is suspected of being in the area, either upon command from the LC 142, or in a substantially continuous fashion, the LBS's pilot channel appears to the target MS 140 as a potential neighboring base station channel, and consequently, is placed, for example, in the CDMA neighboring set, or the CDMA remaining set, of the target MS 140 (as one familiar with the CDMA standards will understand).",
        "During the normal CDMA pilot search sequence of the mobile station initialization state (in the target MS), the target MS 140 will, if within range of such an activated LBS 152, detect the LBS pilot presence during the CDMA pilot channel acquisition substate. Consequently, the target MS 140 performs RF measurements on the signal from each detected LBS 152. Similarly, an activated LBS 152 can perform RF measurements on the wireless signals from the target MS 140. Accordingly, each LBS 152 detecting the target MS 140 may subsequently telemeter back to the LC 142 measurement results related to signals from/to the target MS 140. Moreover, upon command, the target MS 140 will telemeter back to the LC 142 its own measurements of the detected LBSs 152, and consequently, this new location information, in conjunction with location related information received from the BSs 122, can be used to locate the target MS 140.",
        "It should be noted that an LBS 152 will normally deny hand-off requests, since typically the LBS does not require the added complexity of handling voice or traffic bearer channels, although economics and peak traffic load conditions would dictate preference here. GPS timing information, needed by any CDMA base station, is either achieved via a the inclusion of a local GPS receiver or via a telemetry process from a neighboring conventional BS 122, which contains a GPS receiver and timing information. Since energy requirements are minimal in such an LBS 152, (rechargeable) batteries or solar cells may be used to power the LBS. No expensive terrestrial transport link is typically required since two-way communication is provided by the included MS 140 (or an electronic variation thereof).",
        "Thus, LBSs 152 may be placed in numerous locations, such as:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) in dense urban canyon areas (e.g., where signal reception may be poor and/or very noisy);\n        (b) in remote areas (e.g., hiking, camping and skiing areas);\n        (c) along highways (e.g., for emergency as well as monitoring traffic flow), and their rest stations; or\n        (d) in general, wherever more location precision is required than is obtainable using other wireless infrastructure network components.\n\nLocation Center\u2014Network Elements API Description",
        "A location application programming interface or L-API 14 (see FIG. 30, and including L-API-Loc_APP 135, L-API-MSC 136, and L-API-SCP 137 shown in FIG. 4), is required between the location center 142 (LC) and the mobile switch center (MSC) network element type, in order to send and receive various control, signals and data messages. The L-API 14 should be implemented using a preferably high-capacity physical layer communications interface, such as IEEE standard 802.3 (10 baseT Ethemet), although other physical layer interfaces could be used, such as fiber optic ATM, frame relay, etc. Two forms of API implementation are possible. In the first case the signals control and data messages are realized using the MSC 112 vendor's native operations messages inherent in the product offering, without any special modifications. In the second case the L-API includes a full suite of commands and messaging content specifically optimized for wireless location purposes, which may require some, although minor development on the part of the MSC vendor.",
        "Signal Processor Description",
        "Referring to FIG. 30, the signal processing subsystem 1220 receives control messages and signal measurements and transmits appropriate control messages to the wireless network via the location applications programming interface referenced earlier, for wireless location purposes. The signal processing subsystem additionally provides various signal identification, conditioning and pre-processing functions, including buffering, signal type classification, signal filtering, message control and routing functions to the location estimate modules.",
        "There can be several combinations of Delay Spread/Signal Strength sets of measurements made available to the signal processing subsystem 1220. In some cases the mobile station 140 (FIG. 4) may be able to detect up to three or four Pilot Channels representing three to four Base Stations, or as few as one Pilot Channel, depending upon the environment. Similarly, possibly more than one BS 122 can detect a mobile station 140 transmitter signal, as evidenced by the provision of cell diversity or soft hand-off in the CDMA standards, and the fact that multiple CMRS' base station equipment commonly will overlap coverage areas. For each mobile station 140 or BS 122 transmitted signal detected by a receiver group at a station, multiple delayed signals, or \u201cfingers\u201d may be detected and tracked resulting from multipath radio propagation conditions, from a given transmitter.",
        "In typical spread spectrum diversity CDMA receiver design, the \u201cfirst\u201d finger represents the most direct, or least delayed multipath signal. Second or possibly third or fourth fingers may also be detected and tracked, assuming the mobile station contains a sufficient number of data receivers. Although traditional TOA and TDOA methods would discard subsequent fingers related to the same transmitted finger, collection and use of these additional values can prove useful to reduce location ambiguity, and are thus collected by the Signal Processing subsystem in the Location Center 142.",
        "From the mobile receiver's perspective, a number of combinations of measurements could be made available to the Location Center. Due to the disperse and near-random nature of CDMA radio signals and propagation characteristics, traditional TOA/TDOA location methods have failed in the past, because the number of signals received in different locations are different. In a particularly small urban area, of say less than 500 square feet, the number of RF signals and their multipath components may vary by over 100 percent.",
        "Due to the large capital outlay costs associated with providing three or more overlapping base station coverage signals in every possible location, most practical digital PCS deployments result in fewer than three base station pilot channels being reportable in the majority of location areas, thus resulting in a larger, more amorphous location estimate. This consequence requires a family of location estimate location modules, each firing whenever suitable data has been presented to a model, thus providing a location estimate to a backend subsystem which resolves ambiguities.",
        "In one embodiment of this invention using backend hypothesis resolution, by utilizing existing knowledge concerning base station coverage area boundaries (such as via the compilation a RF coverage database\u2014either via RF coverage area simulations or field tests), the location error space is decreased. Negative logic Venn diagrams can be generated which deductively rule out certain location estimate hypotheses.",
        "Although the forward link mobile station's received relative signal strength (RRSSBS) of detected nearby base station transmitter signals can be used directly by the location estimate modules, the CDMA base station's reverse link received relative signal strength (RRSSMS) of the detected mobile station transmitter signal must be modified prior to location estimate model use, since the mobile station transmitter power level changes nearly continuously, and would thus render relative signal strength useless for location purposes.",
        "One adjustment variable and one factor value are required by the signal processing subsystem in the CDMA air interface case: 1.) instantaneous relative power level in dBm (IRPL) of the mobile station transmitter, and 2.) the mobile station Power Class. By adding the IRPL to the RRSSMS, a synthetic relative signal strength (SRSSMS) of the mobile station 140 signal detected at the BS 122 is derived, which can be used by location estimate model analysis, as shown below:\n\nSRSSMS=RRSSMS+IRPL\u2003\u2003(in dBm)\n\nSRSSMS a corrected indication of the effective path loss in the reverse direction (mobile station to BS), is now comparable with RRSSBS and can be used to provide a correlation with either distance or shadow fading because it now accounts for the change of the mobile station transmitter's power level. The two signals RRSSBS and SRSSMS can now be processed in a variety of ways to achieve a more robust correlation with distance or shadow fading.",
        "Although Rayleigh fading appears as a generally random noise generator, essentially destroying the correlation value of either RRSSBS or SRSSMS measurements with distance individually, several mathematical operations or signal processing functions can be performed on each measurement to derive a more robust relative signal strength value, overcoming the adverse Rayleigh fading effects. Examples include averaging, taking the strongest value and weighting the strongest value with a greater coefficient than the weaker value, then averaging the results. This signal processing technique takes advantage of the fact that although a Rayleigh fade may often exist in either the forward or reverse path, it is much less probable that a Rayleigh fade also exists in the reverse or forward path, respectively. A shadow fade however, similarly affects the signal strength in both paths.",
        "At this point a CDMA radio signal direction independent of \u201cnet relative signal strength measurement\u201d can be derived which can be used to establish a correlation with either distance or shadow fading, or both. Although the ambiguity of either shadow fading or distance cannot be determined, other means can be used in conjunction, such as the fingers of the CDMA delay spread measurement, and any other TOA/TDOA calculations from other geographical points. In the case of a mobile station with a certain amount of shadow fading between its BS 122 (FIG. 2), the first finger of a CDMA delay spread signal is most likely to be a relatively shorter duration than the case where the mobile station 140 and BS 122 are separated by a greater distance, since shadow fading does not materially affect the arrival time delay of the radio signal.",
        "By performing a small modification in the control electronics of the CDMA base station and mobile station receiver circuitry, it is possible to provide the signal processing subsystem 1220 (reference FIG. 30) within the location center 142 (FIG. 1) with data that exceed the one-to-one CDMA delay-spread fingers to data receiver correspondence. Such additional information, in the form of additional CDMA fingers (additional multipath) and all associated detectable pilot channels, provides new information which is used to enhance the accuracy of the location center's location estimators.",
        "This enhanced capability is provided via a control message, sent from the location center 142 to the mobile switch center 12, and then to the base station(s) in communication with, or in close proximity with, mobile stations 140 to be located. Two types of location measurement request control messages are needed: one to instruct a target mobile station 140 (i.e., the mobile station to be located) to telemeter its BS pilot channel measurements back to the primary BS 122 and from there to the mobile switch center 112 and then to the location system 42. The second control message is sent from the location system 42 to the mobile switch center 112, then to first the primary BS, instructing the primary BS' searcher receiver to output (i.e., return to the initiating request message source) the detected target mobile station 140 transmitter CDMA pilot channel offset signal and their corresponding delay spread finger (peak) values and related relative signal strengths.",
        "The control messages are implemented in standard mobile station 140 and BS 122 CDMA receivers such that all data results from the search receiver and multiplexed results from the associated data receivers are available for transmission back to the Location Center 142. Appropriate value ranges are required regarding mobile station 140 parameters T_ADDS, T_DROPS, and the ranges and values for the Active, Neighboring and Remaining Pilot sets registers, held within the mobile station 140 memory. Further mobile station 140 receiver details have been discussed above.",
        "In the normal case without any specific multiplexing means to provide location measurements, exactly how many CDMA pilot channels and delay spread fingers can or should be measured vary according to the number of data receivers contained in each mobile station 140. As a guide, it is preferred that whenever RF characteristics permit, at least three pilot channels and the strongest first three fingers, are collected and processed. From the BS 122 perspective, it is preferred that the strongest first four CDMA delay spread fingers and the mobile station power level be collected and sent to the location system 42, for each of preferably three BSs 122 which can detect the mobile station 140. A much larger combination of measurements is potentially feasible using the extended data collection capability of the CDMA receivers.",
        "FIG. 30 illustrates the components of the Signal Processing Subsystem 1220 (also shown in FIGS. 5, 6 and 8). The main components consist of the input queue(s) 7, signal classifier/filter 9, digital signaling processor 17, imaging filters 19, output queue(s) 21, router/distributor 23, (also denoted as the \u201cData Capture And Gateway\u201d in FIG. 8(2)), a signal processor database 26 and a signal processing controller 15.",
        "Input queues 7 are required in order to stage the rapid acceptance of a significant amount of RF signal measurement data, used for either location estimate purposes or to accept autonomous location data. Each location request using fixed base stations may, in one embodiment, contain from 1 to 128 radio frequency measurements from the mobile station, which translates to approximately 61.44 kilobytes of signal measurement data to be collected within 10 seconds and 128 measurements from each of possibly four base stations, or 245.76 kilobytes for all base stations, for a total of approximately 640 signal measurements from the five sources, or 307.2 kilobytes to arrive per mobile station location request in 10 seconds. An input queue storage space is assigned at the moment a location request begins, in order to establish a formatted data structure in persistent store. Depending upon the urgency of the time required to render a location estimate, fewer or more signal measurement samples can be taken and stored in the input queue(s) 7 accordingly.",
        "The signal processing subsystem 1220 supports a variety of wireless network signaling measurement capabilities by detecting the capabilities of the mobile and base station through messaging structures provided by the location application programming interface (L-API 14, FIG. 30). Detection is accomplished in the signal classifier 9 (FIG. 30) by referencing a mobile station database table within the signal processor database 26, which provides, given a mobile station identification number, mobile station revision code, other mobile station characteristics. Similarly, a mobile switch center table 31 provides MSC characteristics and identifications to the signal classifier/filter 9. The signal classifier/filter adds additional message header information that further classifies the measurement data which allows the digital signal processor and image filter components to select the proper internal processing subcomponents to perform operations on the signal measurement data, for use by the location estimate modules.",
        "Regarding service control point messages (of L-API-SCP interface 137, FIG. 4) autonomously received from the input queue 7 (FIGS. 30 and 31), the signal classifier/filter 9 determines via a signal processing database 26 query whether such a message is to be associated with a home base station module. Thus appropriate header information is added to the message, thus enabling the message to pass through the digital signal processor 17 unaffected to the output queue 21, and then to the router/distributor 23. The router/distributor 23 then routes the message to the I-LBS first order model. Those skilled in the art will understand that associating location requests from Home Base Station configurations require substantially less data: the mobile identification number and the associated wire line telephone number transmission from the home location register are on the order of less than 32 bytes. Consequentially the home base station message type could be routed without any digital signal processing.",
        "Output queue(s) 21 (FIG. 30) are required for similar reasons as input queues 7: relatively large amounts of data must be held in a specific format for further location processing by the location estimate modules 1224.",
        "The router and distributor component 23 (FIG. 30) is responsible for directing specific signal measurement data types and structures to their appropriate modules. For example, the HBS FOM has no use for digital filtering structures, whereas the TDOA module would not be able to process an HBS response message.",
        "The controller 15 (FIG. 30) is responsible for staging the movement of data among the signal processing subsystem 1220 components input queue 7, digital signal processor 17, router/distributor 23 and the output queue 21, and to initiate signal measurements within the wireless network, in response from an internet 468 location request message in FIG. 5, via the location application programming interface.",
        "In addition the controller 15 receives autonomous messages from the MSC, via the location applications programming interface or L-API 14 (FIG. 30) and the input queue 7, whenever a 9-1-1 wireless call is originated. The mobile switch center provides this autonomous notification to the location system as follows: by specifying the appropriate mobile switch center operations and maintenance commands to surveil calls based on certain digits dialed such as 9-1-1, the location applications programming interface 14, in communications with the MSCs, receives an autonomous notification whenever a mobile station user dials 9-1-1. Specifically, a bi-directional authorized communications port is configured, usually at the operations and maintenance subsystem of the MSCs, or with their associated network element manager system(s), with a data circuit, such as a DS-1, with the location applications programming interface 14. Next, the \u201ccall trace\u201d capability of the mobile switch center is activated for the respective communications port. The exact implementation of the vendor-specific man-machine or Open Systems Interface (OSI) command(s) and their associated data structures generally vary among MSC vendors. However, the trace function is generally available in various forms, and is required in order to comply with Federal Bureau of Investigation authorities for wire tap purposes. After the appropriate surveillance commands are established on the MSC, such 9-1-1 call notifications messages containing the mobile station identification number (MIN) and, in U.S. FCC phase 1 E9-1-1 implementations, a pseudo-automatic number identification (a.k.a. pANI) which provides an association with the primary base station in which the 9-1-1 caller is in communication. In cases where the pANI is known from the onset, the signal processing subsystem 1220 avoids querying the MSC in question to determine the primary base station identification associated with the 9-1-1 mobile station caller.",
        "After the signal processing controller 15 receives the first message type, the autonomous notification message from the mobile switch center 112 to the location system 142, containing the mobile identification number and optionally the primary base station identification, the controller 15 queries the base station table 13 (FIG. 30) in the signal processor database 26 to determine the status and availability of any neighboring base stations, including those base stations of other CMRS in the area. The definition of neighboring base stations include not only, those within a provisionable \u201chop\u201d based on the cell design reuse factor, but also includes, in the case of CDMA, results from remaining set information autonomously queried to mobile stations, with results stored in the base station table. Remaining set information indicates that mobile stations can detect other base station (sector) pilot channels which may exceed the \u201chop\u201d distance, yet are nevertheless candidate base stations (or sectors) for wireless location purposes. Although cellular and digital cell design may vary, \u201chop\u201d distance is usually one or two cell coverage areas away from the primary base station's cell coverage area.",
        "Having determined a likely set of base stations which may both detect the mobile station's transmitter signal, as well as to determine the set of likely pilot channels (i.e., base stations and their associated physical antenna sectors) detectable by the mobile station in the area surrounding the primary base station (sector), the controller 15 initiates messages to both the mobile station and appropriate base stations (sectors) to perform signal measurements and to return the results of such measurements to the signal processing system regarding the mobile station to be located. This step may be accomplished via several interface means. In a first case the controller 15 utilizes, for a given MSC, predetermined storage information in the MSC table 31 to determine which type of commands, such as man-machine or OSI commands are needed to request such signal measurements for a given MSC. The controller generates the mobile and base station signal measurement commands appropriate for the MSC and passes the commands via the input queue 7 and the locations application programming interface 14 in FIG. 30, to the appropriate MSC, using the authorized communications port mentioned earlier. In a second case, the controller 15 communicates directly with base stations within having to interface directly with the MSC for signal measurement extraction.",
        "Upon receipt of the signal measurements, the signal classifier 9 in FIG. 30 examines location application programming interface-provided message header information from the source of the location measurement (for example, from a fixed BS 122,a mobile station 140, a distributed antenna system 168 in FIG. 4 or message location data related to a home base station), provided by the location applications programming interface (L-API 14) via the input queue 7 in FIG. 30 and determines whether or not device filters 17 or image filters 19 are needed, and assesses a relative priority in processing, such as an emergency versus a background location task, in terms of grouping like data associated with a given location request. In the case where multiple signal measurement requests are outstanding for various base stations, some of which may be associated with a different CMRS network, and additional signal classifier function includes sorting and associating the appropriate incoming signal measurements together such that the digital signal processor 17 processes related measurements in order to build ensemble data sets. Such ensembles allow for a variety of functions such as averaging, outlier removal over a time period, and related filtering functions, and further prevent association errors from occurring in location estimate processing.",
        "Another function of the signal classifier/low pass filter component 9 is to filter information that is not useable, or information that could introduce noise or the effect of noise in the location estimate modules. Consequently low pass matching filters are used to match the in-common signal processing components to the characteristics of the incoming signals. Low pass filters match: Mobile Station, base station, CMRS and MSC characteristics, as well as to classify Home Base Station messages.",
        "The signal processing subsystem 1220 contains a base station database table 13 (FIG. 30) which captures the maximum number of CDMA delay spread fingers for a given base station.",
        "The base station identification code, or CLLI or common language level identification code is useful in identifying or relating a human-labeled name descriptor to the Base Station. Latitude, Longitude and elevation values are used by other subsystems in the location system for calibration and estimation purposes. As base stations and/or receiver characteristics are added, deleted, or changed with respect to the network used for location purposes, this database table must be modified to reflect the current network configuration.",
        "Just as an upgraded base station may detect additional CDMA delay spread signals, newer or modified mobile stations may detect additional pilot channels or CDMA delay spread fingers. Additionally different makes and models of mobile stations may acquire improved receiver sensitivities, suggesting a greater coverage capability. A table may establish the relationships among various mobile station equipment suppliers and certain technical data relevant to this location invention.",
        "Although not strictly necessary, the MIN can be populated in this table from the PCS Service Provider's Customer Care system during subscriber activation and fulfillment, and could be changed at deactivation, or anytime the end-user changes mobile stations. Alternatively, since the MIN, manufacturer, model number, and software revision level information is available during a telephone call, this information could extracted during the call, and the remaining fields populated dynamically, based on manufacturer's specifications information previously stored in the signal processing subsystem 1220. Default values are used in cases where the MIN is not found, or where certain information must be estimated.",
        "A low pass mobile station filter, contained within the signal classifier/low pass filter 9 of the signal processing subsystem 1220, uses the above table data to perform the following functions: 1) act as a low pass filter to adjust the nominal assumptions related to the maximum number of CDMA fingers, pilots detectable; and 2) to determine the transmit power class and the receiver thermal noise floor. Given the detected reverse path signal strength, the required value of SRSSMS, a corrected indication of the effective path loss in the reverse direction (mobile station to BS), can be calculated based on data contained within the mobile station table 11, stored in the signal processing database 26.",
        "The effects of the maximum number of CDMA fingers allowed and the maximum number of pilot channels allowed essentially form a low pass filter effect, wherein the least common denominator of characteristics are used to filter the incoming RF signal measurements such that a one for one matching occurs. The effect of the transmit power class and receiver thermal noise floor values is to normalize the characteristics of the incoming RF signals with respect to those RF signals used.",
        "The signal classifier/filter 9 (FIG. 30) is in communication with both the input queue 7 and the signal processing database 26. In the early stage of a location request the signal processing subsystem 1220 shown in, e.g., FIGS. 5, 30 and 31, will receive the initiating location request from either an autonomous 9-1-1 notification message from a given MSC, or from a location application, for which mobile station characteristics about the target mobile station 140 (FIG. 4) is required. Referring to FIG. 30, a query is made from the signal processing controller 15 to the signal processing database 26, specifically the mobile station table 11, to determine if the mobile station characteristics associated with the MIN to be located is available in table 11. If the data exists then there is no need for the controller 15 to query the wireless network in order to determine the mobile station characteristics, thus avoiding additional real-time processing which would otherwise be required across the air interface; in order to determine the mobile station MIN characteristics. The resulting mobile station information my be provided either via the signal processing database 26 or alternatively a query may be performed directly from the signal processing subsystem 1220 to the MSC in order to determine the mobile station characteristics.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 31, another location application programming interface, L-API-CCS 239 to the appropriate CMRS customer care system provides the mechanism to populate and update the mobile station table 11 within the database 26. The L-API-CCS 239 contains its own set of separate input and output queues or similar implementations and security controls to ensure that provisioning data is not sent to the customer care system for CMRS-A 1150a provides an autonomous or periodic notification and response application layer protocol type, consisting of add, delete, change and verify message functions in order to update the mobile station table 11 within the signal processing database 26, via the controller 15. A similar interface 155b is used to enable provisioning updates to be received from CMRS-B customer care system 1150b.",
        "Although the L-API-CCS application message set may be any protocol type which supports the autonomous notification message with positive acknowledgment type, the T1M1.5 group within the American National Standards Institute has defined a good starting point in which the L-API-CCS 239 could be implemented, using the robust OSI TMN X-interface at the service management layer. The object model defined in Standards proposal number T1M1.5/96-22R9, Operations Administration, Maintenance, and Provisioning (OAM&P)\u2014Model for Interface Across Jurisdictional Boundaries to Support Electronic Access Service Ordering: Inquiry Function, can be extended to support the L-API-CCS information elements as required and further discussed below. Other choices in which the L-API-CCS application message set may be implemented include ASCII, binary, or any encrypted message set encoding using the Internet protocols, such as TCP/IP, simple network management protocol, http, https, and email protocols.",
        "Referring to the digital signal processor (DSP) 17, in communication with the signal classifier/LP filter 9, the DSP 17 provides a time series expansion method to convert non-HBS data from a format of an signal measure data ensemble of time-series based radio frequency data measurements, collected as discrete time-slice samples, to a three dimensional matrix location data value image representation. Other techniques further filter the resultant image in order to furnish a less noisy training and actual data sample to the location estimate modules.",
        "After 128 samples (in one embodiment) of data are collected of the delay spread-relative signal strength RF data measurement sample: mobile station RX for BS-1 and grouped into a quantization matrix, where rows constitute relative signal strength intervals and columns define delay intervals. As each measurement row, column pair (which could be represented as a complex number or Cartesian point pair) is added to their respective values to generate a Z direction of frequency of recurring measurement value pairs or a density recurrence function. By next applying a grid function to each x, y, and z value, a three-dimensional surface grid is generated, which represents a location data value or unique print of that 128-sample measurement.",
        "In the general case where a mobile station is located in an environment with varied clutter patterns, such as terrain undulations, unique man-made structure geometries (thus creating varied multipath signal behaviors), such as a city or suburb, although the first CDMA delay spread finger may be the same value for a fixed distance between the mobile station and BS antennas, as the mobile station moves across such an area, different finger-data are measured. In the right image for the defined BS antenna sector, location classes, or squares numbered one through seven, are shown across a particular range of line of position (LOP).",
        "A traditional TOA/TDOA ranging method between a given BS and mobile station only provides a range along an arc, thus introducing ambiguity error. However a unique three dimensional image can be used in this method to specifically identify, with recurring probability, a particular unique location class along the same Line Of Position, as long as the multipath is unique by position but generally repeatable, thus establishing a method of not only ranging, but also of complete latitude, longitude location estimation in a Cartesian space. In other words, the unique shape of the \u201cmountain image\u201d enables a correspondence to a given unique location class along a line of position, thereby eliminating traditional ambiguity error.",
        "Although man-made external sources of interference, Rayleigh fades, adjacent and co-channel interference, and variable clutter, such as moving traffic introduce unpredictability (thus no \u201cmountain image\u201d would ever be exactly alike), three basic types of filtering methods can be used to reduce matching/comparison error from a training case to a location request case: 1.) select only the strongest signals from the forward path (BS to mobile station) and reverse path (mobile station to BS), 2.) Convolute the forward path 128 sample image with the reverse path 128 sample image, and 3.) process all image samples through various digital image filters to discard noise components.",
        "In one embodiment, convolution of forward and reverse images is performed to drive out noise. This is one embodiment that essentially nulls noise completely, even if strong and recurring, as long as that same noise characteristic does not occur in the opposite path.",
        "The third embodiment or technique of processing CDMA delay spread profile images through various digital image filters, provides a resultant \u201cimage enhancement\u201d in the sense of providing a more stable pattern recognition paradigm to the neural net location estimate model. For example, image histogram equalization can be used to rearrange the images' intensity values, or density recurrence values, so that the image's cumulative histogram is approximately linear.",
        "Other methods which can be used to compensate for a concentrated histogram include: 1) Input Cropping, 2) Output Cropping and 3) Gamma Correction. Equalization and input cropping can provide particularly striking benefits to a CDMA delay spread profile image. Input cropping removes a large percentage of random signal characteristics that are non-recurring.",
        "Other filters and/or filter combinations can be used to help distinguish between stationary and variable clutter affecting multipath signals. For example, it is desirable to reject multipath fingers associated with variable clutter, since over a period of a few minutes such fingers would not likely recur. Further filtering can be used to remove recurring (at least during the sample period), and possibly strong but narrow \u201cpencils\u201d of RF energy. A narrow pencil image component could be represented by a near perfect reflective surface, such as a nearby metal panel truck stopped at a traffic light.",
        "On the other hand, stationary clutter objects, such as concrete and glass building surfaces, adsorb some radiation before continuing with a reflected ray at some delay. Such stationary clutter-affected CDMA fingers are more likely to pass a 4\u00d74 neighbor Median filter as well as a 40 to 50 percent Input Crop filter, and are thus more suited to neural net pattern recognition. However when subjected to a 4\u00d74 neighbor Median filter and 40 percent clipping, pencil-shaped fingers are deleted. Other combinations include, for example, a 50 percent cropping and 4\u00d74 neighbor median filtering. Other filtering methods include custom linear filtering, adaptive (Weiner) filtering, and custom nonlinear filtering.",

        "As can be seen in the Table LH-1, each location hypothesis data structure includes at least one measurement, denoted hereinafter as a confidence value (or simply confidence), that is a measurement of the perceived likelihood that an MS location estimate in the location hypothesis is an accurate location estimate of the target MS 140. Since such confidence values are an important aspect of the present invention, much of the description and use of such confidence values are described below; however, a brief description is provided here. Each such confidence value is in the range \u22121.0 to 1.0, wherein the larger the value, the greater the perceived likelihood that the target MS 140 is in (or at) a corresponding MS location estimate of the location hypothesis to which the confidence value applies. As an aside, note that a location hypothesis may have more than one MS location estimate (as will be discussed in detail below) and the confidence value will typically only correspond or apply to one of the MS location estimates in the location hypothesis. Further, values for the confidence value field may be interpreted as: (a) \u22121.0 may be interpreted to mean that the target MS 140 is NOT in such a corresponding MS area estimate of the location hypothesis area, (b) 0 may be interpreted to mean that it is unknown as to the likelihood of whether the MS 140 in the corresponding MS area estimate, and (c) +1.0 may be interpreted to mean that the MS 140 is perceived to positively be in the corresponding MS area estimate.",
        "Additionally, note that it is within the scope of the present invention that the location hypothesis data structure may also include other related \u201cperception\u201d measurements related to a likelihood of the target MS 140 being in a particular MS location area estimate. For example, it is within the scope of the present invention to also utilize measurements such as, (a) \u201csufficiency factors\u201d for indicating the likelihood that an MS location estimate of a location hypothesis is sufficient for locating the target MS 140; (b) \u201cnecessity factors\u201d for indicating the necessity that the target MS be in an particular area estimate. However, to more easily describe the present invention, a single confidence field is used having the interpretation given above.",
        "Additionally, in utilizing location hypotheses in, for example, the location evaluator 1228 as in (23.4) above, it is important to keep in mind that each location hypothesis confidence value is a relative measurement. That is, for confidences, cf1 and cf2, if cf1<=cf2, then for a location hypotheses H1 and H2 having cf1 and cf2, respectively, the target MS 140 is expected to more likely reside in a target MS estimate of H2 than a target MS estimate of H1. Moreover, if an area, A, is such that it is included in a plurality of location hypothesis target MS estimates, then a confidence score, GSA, can be assigned to A, wherein the confidence score for such an area is a function of the confidences (both positive and negative) for all the location hypotheses whose (most pertinent) target MS location estimates contain A. That is, in order to determine a most likely target MS location area estimate for outputting from the location center 142, a confidence score is determined for areas within the location center service area. More particularly, if a function, \u201cf\u201d, is a function of the confidence(s) of location hypotheses, and f is a monotonic function in its parameters and f(cf1, cf2, cf3, . . . , cfN)=GSA for confidences cfi, of location hypotheses Hi, i=1, 2, . . . , N, with GSA contained in the area estimate for Hi, then \u201cf\u201d is denoted a confidence score function. Accordingly, there are many embodiments for a confidence score function f that maybe utilized in computing confidence scores with the present invention; e.g.,",
        "(a) f(cf1, cf2, . . . , cfN)=cfi,=GSA;",
        "(b) f(cf1, cf2, . . . , cfN)=cfin=CSA, n=1, 3, 5, . . . ;",
        "(c) f(cf1, cf2, . . . , cfN)=(Ki, * cfi)=CSA, wherein Ki, i=1, 2, . . . are positive system (tunable) constants (possibly dependent on environmental characteristics such as topography, time, date, traffic, weather, and/or the type of base station(s) 122 from which location signatures with the target MS 140 are being generated, etc.).",
        "For the present description of the invention, the function f as defined in (c) immediately above is utilized. However, for obtaining a general understanding of the present invention, the simpler confidence score function of (a) may be more useful. It is important to note, though, that it is within the scope of the present invention to use other functions for the confidence score function.",
        "Coverage Area: Area Types And Their Determination",
        "The notion of \u201carea type\u201d as related to wireless signal transmission characteristics has been used in many investigations of radio signal transmission characteristics. Some investigators, when investigating such signal characteristics of areas have used somewhat naive area classifications such as urban, suburban, rural, etc. However, it is desirable for the purposes of the present invention to have a more operational definition of area types that is more closely associated with wireless signal transmission behaviors.",
        "To describe embodiments of the an area type scheme used in the present invention, some introductory remarks are first provided. Note that the wireless signal transmission behavior for an area depends on at least the following criteria:\n\n    \n    \n        (23.8.1) substantially invariant terrain characteristics (both natural and man-made) of the area; e.g., mountains, buildings, lakes, highways, bridges, building density;\n        (23.8.2) time varying environmental characteristics (both natural and man-made) of the area; e.g., foliage, traffic, weather, special events such as baseball games;\n        (23.8.3) wireless communication components or infrastructure in the area; e.g., the arrangement and signal communication characteristics of the base stations 122 in the area. Further, the antenna characteristics at the base stations 122 may be important criteria.",
        "Accordingly, a description of wireless signal characteristics for determining area types could potentially include a characterization of wireless signaling attributes as they relate to each of the above criteria Thus, an area type might be: hilly, treed, suburban, having no buildings above 50 feet, with base stations spaced apart by two miles. However, a categorization of area types is desired that is both more closely tied to the wireless signaling characteristics of the area, and is capable of being computed substantially automatically and repeatedly over time. Moreover, for a wireless location system, the primary wireless signaling characteristics for categorizing areas into at least minimally similar area types are: thermal noise and, more importantly, multipath characteristics (e.g., multipath fade and time delay).",
        "Focusing for the moment on the multipath characteristics, it is believed that (23.8.1) and (23.8.3) immediately above are, in general, more important criteria for accurately locating an MS 140 than (23.8.2). That is, regarding (23.8.1), multipath tends to increase as the density of nearby vertical area changes increases. For example, multipath is particularly problematic where there is a high density of high rise buildings and/or where there are closely spaced geographic undulations. In both cases, the amount of change in vertical area per unit of area in a horizontal plane (for some horizontal reference plane) may be high. Regarding (23.8.3), the greater the density of base stations 122, the less problematic multipath may become in locating an MS 140. Moreover, the arrangement of the base stations 122 in the radio coverage area 120 in FIG. 4 may affect the amount and severity of multipath.",
        "Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a method and system for straightforwardly determining area type classifications related to multipath, and in particular, multipath due to (23.8.1) and (23.8.3). The present invention provides such a determination by utilizing a novel notion of area type, hereinafter denoted \u201ctransmission area type\u201d (or, \u201c(transmission) area type\u201d when both a generic area type classification scheme and the transmission area type discussed hereinafter are intended) for classifying \u201csimilar\u201d areas, wherein each transmission area type class or category is intended to describe an area having at least minimally similar wireless signal transmission characteristics. That is, the novel transmission area type scheme of the present invention is based on: (a) the terrain area classifications; e.g., the terrain of an area surrounding a target MS 140, (b) the configuration of base stations 122 in the radio coverage area 120, and (c) characterizations of the wireless signal transmission paths between a target MS 140 location and the base stations 122.",
        "In one embodiment of a method and system for determining such (transmission) area type approximations, a partition (denoted hereinafter as P0) is imposed upon the radio coverage area 120 for partitioning for radio coverage area into subareas, wherein each subarea is an estimate of an area having included MS 140 locations that are likely to have is at least a minimal amount of similarity in their wireless signaling characteristics. To obtain the partition P0 of the radio coverage area 120, the following steps are performed:\n\n    \n    \n        (23.8.4.1) Partition the radio coverage area 120 into subareas, wherein in each subarea is: (a) connected, (b) variations in the lengths of chords sectioning the subarea through the centroid of the subarea are below a predetermined threshold, (c) the subarea has an area below a predetermined value, and (d) for most locations (e.g., within a first or second standard deviation) within the subarea whose wireless signaling characteristics have been verified, it is likely (e.g., within a first or second standard deviation ) that an MS 140 at one of these locations will detect (forward transmission path) and/or will be detected (reverse transmission path) by a same collection of base stations 122. For example, in a CDMA context, a first such collection may be (for the forward transmission path) the active set of base stations 122, or, the union of the active and candidate sets, or, the union of the active, candidate and/or remaining sets of base stations 122 detected by \u201cmost\u201d MSs 140 in the subarea. Additionally (or altematively), a second such collection may be the base stations 122 that are expected to detect MSs 140 at locations within the subarea. Of course, the union or intersection of the first and second collections is also within the scope of the present invention for partitioning the radio coverage area 120 according to (d) above. It is worth noting that it is believed that base station 122 power levels will be substantially constant. However, even if this is not the case, one or more collections for (d) above may be determined empirically and/or by computationally simulating the power output of each base station 122 at a predetermined level. Moreover, it is also worth mentioning that this step is relatively straightforward to implement using the data stored in the location signature data base 1320 (i.e., the verified location signature clusters discussed in detail hereinbelow). Denote the resulting partition here as P1.\n        (23.8.4.2) Partition the radio coverage area 120 into subareas, wherein each subarea appears to have substantially homogeneous terrain characteristics. Note, this may be performed periodically substantially automatically by scanning radio coverage area images obtained from aerial or satellite imaging. For example, Earth Watch Inc. of Longmont, CO can provide geographic with 3 meter resolution from satellite imaging data. Denote the resulting partition here as P2.\n        (23.8.4.3) Overlay both of the above partitions of the radio coverage area 120 to obtain new subareas that are intersections of the subareas from each of the above partitions. This new partition is P0 (i.e., P0=P1 intersect P2), and the subareas of it are denoted as \u201cP0 subareas\u201d.",
        "Now assuming P0 has been obtained, the subareas of P0 are provided with a first classification or categorization as follows:\n\n    \n    \n        (23.8.4.4) Determine an area type categorization scheme for the subareas of P1. For example, a subarea, A, of P1, may be categorized or labeled according to the number of base stations 122 in each of the collections used in (23.8.4.1)(d) above for determining subareas of P1. Thus, in one such categorization scheme, each category may correspond to a single number x (such as 3), wherein for a subarea, A, of this category, there is a group of x (e.g., three) base stations 122 that are expected to be detected by a most target MSs 140 in the area A. Other embodiments are also possible, such as a categorization scheme wherein each category may correspond to a triple: of numbers such as (5, 2, 1), wherein for a subarea A of this category, there is a common group of 5 base stations 122 with two-way signal detection expected with most locations (e.g., within a first or second deviation) within A, there are 2 base stations that are expected to be detected by a target MS 140 in A but these base stations can not detect the target MS, and there is one base station 122 that is expected to be able to detect a target MS in A but not be detected.\n        (23.8.4.5) Determine an area type categorization scheme for the subareas of P2. Note that the subareas of P2 may be categorized according to their similarities. In one embodiment, such categories may be somewhat similar to the naive area types mentioned above (e.g., dense urban, urban, suburban, rural, mountain, etc.). However, it is also an aspect of the present invention that more precise categorizations may be used, such as a category for all areas having between 20,000 and 30,000 square feet of vertical area change per 11,000 square feet of horizontal area and also having a high traffic volume (such a category likely corresponding to a \u201cmoderately dense urban\u201d area type).\n        (23.8.4.6) Categorize subareas of P0 with a categorization scheme denoted the \u201cP0 categorization,\u201d wherein for each P0 subarea, A, of P0 a \u201cP0 area type\u201d is determined for A according to the following substep(s):\n        \n            (a) Categorize A by the two categories from (23.8.4.4) and (23.8.5) with which it is identified. Thus, A is categorized (in a corresponding P0 area type) both according to its terrain and the base station infrastructure configuration in the radio coverage area 120.\n        \n        \n        (23.8.4.7) For each P0 subarea, A, of P0 perform the following step(s):\n        \n            (a) Determine a centroid, C(A), for A;\n            (b) Determine an approximation to a wireless transmission path between C(A) and each base station 122 of a predetermined group of base stations expected to be in (one and/or two-way) signal communication with most target MS 140 locations in A. For example, one such approximation is a straight line between C(A) and each of the basestations 122 in the group. However, other such approximations are within the scope of the present invention, such as, a generally triangular shaped area as the transmission path, wherein a first vertex of this area is at the corresponding base station for the transmission path, and the sides of the generally triangular shaped defining the first vertex have a smallest angle between them that allows A to be completely between these sides.\n            (c) For each base station 122, BS1, in the group mentioned in (b) above, create an empty list, BS1-list, and put on this list at least the P0 area types for the \u201csignificant\u201d P0 subareas crossed by the transmission path between C(A) and BS1. Note that \u201csignificant\u201d P0 subareas may be defined as, for example, the P0 subareas through which at least a minimal length of the transmission path traverses. Alternatively, such \u201csignificant\u201d P0 subareas may be defined as those P0 subareas that additionally are know or expected to generate substantial multipath.\n            (d) Assign as the transmission area type for A as the collection of BS1-lists. Thus, any other P0 subarea having the same (or substantially similar) collection of lists of P0 area types will be viewed as having approximately the same radio transmission characteristics.",
        "Note that other transmission signal characteristics may be incorporated into the transmission area types. For example, thermal noise characteristics may be included by providing a third radio coverage area 120 partition, P3, in addition to the partitions of P1 and P2 generated in (23.8.4.1) and (23.8.4.2) respectively. Moreover, the time varying characteristics of (23.8.2) may be incorporated in the transmission area type frame work by generating multiple versions of the transmission area types such that the transmission area type for a given subarea of P0 may change depending on the combination of time varying environmental characteristics to be considered in the transmission area types. For instance, to account for seasonality, four versions of the partitions P1 and P2 may be generated, one for each of the seasons, and subsequently generate a (potentially) different partition P0 for each season. Further, the type and/or characteristics of base station 122 antennas may also be included in an embodiment of the transmission area type.",
        "Accordingly, in one embodiment of the present invention, whenever the term \u201carea type\u201d is used hereinbelow, transmission area types as described hereinabove are intended.",
        "Location Information Data Bases And Data",
        "Location Data Bases Introduction",
        "It is an aspect of the present invention that MS location processing performed by the location center 142 should become increasingly better at locating a target MS 140 both by (a) building an increasingly more detailed model of the signal characteristics of locations in service area for the present invention, and also (b) by providing capabilities for the location center processing to adapt to environmental changes.",
        "One way these aspects of the present invention are realized is by providing one or more data base management systems and data bases for:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) storing and associating wireless MS signal characteristics with known locations of MSs 140 used in providing the signal characteristics. Such stored associations may not only provide an increasingly better model of the signal characteristics of the geography of the service area, but also provide an increasingly better model of more changeable signal characteristic affecting environmental factors such as weather, seasons, and/or traffic patterns;\n        (b) adaptively updating the signal characteristic data stored so that it reflects changes in the environment of the service area such as, for example, a new high rise building or a new highway.",
        "Referring again to FIG. 5 of the collective representation of these data bases is the location information data bases 1232. Included among these data bases is a data base for providing training and/or calibration data to one or more trainable/calibratable FOMs 1224, as well as an archival data base for archiving historical MS location information related to the performance of the FOMs. These data bases will be discussed as necessary hereinbelow. However, a further brief introduction to the archival data base is provided here. Accordingly, the term, \u201clocation signature data base\u201d is used hereinafter to denote the archival data base and/or data base management system depending on the context of the discussion. The location signature data base (shown in, for example, FIG. 6 and labeled 1320) is a repository for wireless signal characteristic data derived from wireless signal communications between an MS 140 and one or more base stations 122, wherein the corresponding location of the MS 140 is known and also stored in the location signature data base 1320. More particularly, the location signature data base 1320 associates each such known MS location with the wireless signal characteristic data derived from wireless signal communications between the MS 140 and one or more base stations 122 at this MS location. Accordingly, it is an aspect of the present invention to utilize such historical MS signal location data for enhancing the correctness and/or confidence of certain location hypotheses as will be described in detail in other sections below.",
        "Data Representations for the Location Signature Data Base",
        "There are four fundamental entity types (or object classes in an object oriented programming paradigm) utilized in the location signature data base 1320. Briefly, these data entities are described in the items (24.1) through (24.4) that follow:\n\n    (24.1) (verified) location signatures: Each such (verified) location signature describes the wireless signal characteristic measurements between a given base station (e.g., BS 122 or LBS 152) and an MS 140 at a (verified or known) location associated with the (verified) location signature. That is, a verified location signature corresponds to a location whose coordinates such as latitude-longitude coordinates are known, while simply a location signature may have a known or unknown location corresponding with it. Note that the term (verified) location signature is also denoted by the abbreviation, \u201c(verified) loc sig\u201d hereinbelow;\n    (24.2) (verified) location signature clusters: Each such (verified) location signature cluster includes a collection of (verified) location signatures corresponding to all the location signatures between a target MS 140 at a (possibly verified) presumed substantially stationary location and each BS (e.g., 122 or 152) from which the target MS 140 can detect the BS's pilot channel regardless of the classification of the BS in the target MS (i.e., for CDMA, regardless of whether a BS is in the MS's active, candidate or remaining base station sets, as one skilled in the art will understand). Note that for simplicity here, it is presumed that each location signature cluster has a single fixed primary base station to which the target MS 140 synchronizes or obtains its timing;\n    (24.3) \u201ccomposite location objects (or entities)\u201d: Each such entity is a more general entity than the verified location signature cluster. An object of this type is a collection of (verified) location signatures that are associated with the same MS 140 at substantially the same location at the same time and each such loc sig is associated with a different base station. However, there is no requirement that a loc sig from each BS 122 for which the MS 140 can detect the BS's pilot channel is included in the \u201ccomposite location object (or entity)\u201d; and\n    (24.4) MS location estimation data that includes MS location estimates output by one or more MS location estimating first order models 1224, such MS location estimate data is described in detail hereinbelow.",
        "It is important to note that a loc sig is, in one embodiment, an instance of the data structure containing the signal characteristic measurements output by the signal filtering and normalizing subsystem also denoted as the signal processing subsystem 1220 describing the signals between: (i) a specific base station 122 (BS) and (ii) a mobile station 140 (MS), wherein the BS's location is known and the MS's location is assumed to be substantially constant (during a 2\u20135 second interval in one embodiment of the present invention), during communication with the MS 140 for obtaining a single instance of loc sig data, although the MS location may or may not be known. Further, for notational purposes, the BS 122 and the MS 140 for a loc sig hereinafter will be denoted the \u201cBS associated with the loc sig\u201d, and the \u201cMS associated with the loc sig\u201d respectively. Moreover, the location of the MS 140 at the time the loc sig data is obtained will be denoted the \u201clocation associated with the loc sig\u201d (this location possibly being unknown).",
        "In particular, for each (verified) loc sig includes the following:\n\n    (25.1) MS_type: the make and model of the target MS 140 associated with a location signature instantiation; note that the type of MS 140 can also be derived from this entry; e.g., whether MS 140 is a handset MS, car-set MS, or an MS for location only. Note as an aside, for at least CDMA, the type of MS 140 provides information as to the number of fingers that may be measured by the MS, as one skilled in the will appreciate.\n    (25.2) BS_id: an identification of the base station 122 (or, location base station 152) communicating with the target MS;\n    (25.3) MS_loc: a representation of a geographic location (e.g., latitude-longitude) or area representing a verified/known MS location where signal characteristics between the associated (location) base station and MS 140 were received. That is, if the \u201cverified_flag\u201d attribute (discussed below) is TRUE, then this attribute includes an estimated location of the target MS. If verified_flag is FALSE, then this attribute has a value indicating \u201clocation unknown\u201d.",
        "Note \u201cMS_loc\u201d may include the following two subfields: an area within which the target MS is presumed to be, and a point location (e.g., a latitude and longitude pair) where the target MS is presumed to be (in one embodiment this is the centroid of the area);\n\n    (25.4) verified_flag: a flag for determining whether the loc sig has been verified; i.e., the value here is TRUE iff a location of MS_loc has been verified, FALSE otherwise. Note, if this field is TRUE (i.e., the loc sig is verified), then the base station identified by BS_id is the current primary base station for the target MS;\n    (25.5) confidence: a value indicating how consistent this loc sig is with other loc sigs in the location signature data base 1320; the value for this entry is in the range [0, 1] with 0 corresponding to the lowest (i.e., no) confidence and 1 corresponding to the highest confidence. That is, the confidence factor is used for determining how consistent the loc sig is with other \u201csimilar\u201d verified loc sigs in the location signature data base 1320, wherein the greater the confidence value, the better the consistency with other loc sigs in the data base. Note that similarity in this context may be operationalized by at least designating a geographic proximity of a loc sig in which to determine if it is similar to other loc sigs in this designated geographic proximity and/or area type (e.g., transmission area type as elsewhere herein). Thus, environmental characteristics may also be used in determining similarities such as: similar time of occurrence (e.g., of day, and/or of month), similar weather (e.g., snowing, raining, etc.). Note, these latter characteristics are different from the notion of geographic proximity since proximity may be only a distance measurement about a location. Note also that a loc sig having a confidence factor value below a predetermined threshold may not be used in evaluating MS location hypotheses generated by the FOMs 1224.\n    (25.6) timestamp: the time and date the loc sig was received by the associated base station of BS_id;\n    (25.7) signal topography characteristics: In one embodiment, the signal topography characteristics retained can be represented as characteristics of at least a two-dimensional generated surface. That is, such a surface is generated by the signal processing subsystem 1220 from signal characteristics accumulated over (a relatively short) time interval. For example, in the two-dimensional surface case, the dimensions for the generated surface may be, for example, signal strength and time delay. That is, the accumulations over a brief time interval of signal characteristic measurements between the BS 122 and the MS 140 (associated with the loc sig) may be classified according to the two signal characteristic dimensions (e.g., signal strength and corresponding time delay). That is, by sampling the signal characteristics and classifying the samples according to a mesh of discrete cells or bins, wherein each cell corresponds to a different range of signal strengths and time delays a tally of the number of samples falling in the range of each cell can be maintained. Accordingly, for each cell, its corresponding tally may be interpreted as height of the cell, so that when the heights of all cells are considered, an undulating or mountainous surface is provided. In particular, for a cell mesh of appropriate fineness, the \u201cmountainous surface\u201d, is believed to, under most circumstances, provide a contour that is substantially unique to the location of the target MS 140. Note that in one embodiment, the signal samples are typically obtained throughout a predetermined signal sampling time interval of 2\u20135 seconds as is discussed elsewhere in this specification. In particular, the signal topography characteristics retained for a loc sig include certain topographical characteristics of such a generated mountainous surface. For example, each loc sig may include: for each local maximum (of the loc sig surface) above a predetermined noise ceiling threshold, the (signal strength, time delay) coordinates of the cell of the local maximum and the corresponding height of the local maximum. Additionally, certain gradients may also be included for characterizing the \u201csteepness\u201d of the surface mountains. Moreover, note that in some embodiments, a frequency may also be associated with each local maximum. Thus, the data retained for each selected local maximum can include a quadruple of signal strength, time delay, height and frequency. Further note that the data types here may vary. However, for simplicity, in parts of the description of loc sig processing related to the signal characteristics here, it is assumed that the signal characteristic topography data structure here is a vector;\n    (25.8) quality_obj: signal quality (or error) measurements, e.g., Eb/No values, as one skilled in the art will understand;\n    (25.9) noise_ceiling: noise ceiling values used in the initial filtering of noise from the signal topography characteristics as provided by the signal processing subsystem 1220;\n    (25.10) power_level: power levels of the base station (e.g., 122 or 152) and MS 140 for the signal measurements;\n    (25.11) timing_error an estimated (or maximum) timing error between the present (associated) BS (e.g., an infrastructure base station 122 or a location base station 152) detecting the target MS 140 and the current primary BS 122 for the target MS 140. Note that if the BS 122 associated with the loc sig is the primary base station, then the value here will be zero;\n    (25.12) cluster_ptr a pointer to the location signature composite entity to which this loc sig belongs.\n    (25.13) repeatable: TRUE if the loc sig is \u201crepeatable\u201d (as described hereinafter), FALSE otherwise. Note that each verified loc sig is designated as either \u201crepeatable\u201d or \u201crandom\u201d. A loc sig is repeatable if the (verified/known) location associated with the loc sig is such that signal characteristic measurements between the associated BS 122 and this MS can be either replaced at periodic time intervals, or updated substantially on demand by most recent signal characteristic measurements between the associated base station and the associated MS 140 (or a comparable MS) at the verified/known location. Repeatable loc sigs may be, for example, provided by stationary or fixed location MSs 140 (e.g., fixed location transceivers) distributed within certain areas of a geographical region serviced by the location center 142 for providing MS location estimates. That is, it is an aspect of the present invention that each such stationary MS 140 can be contacted by the location center 142 (via the base stations of the wireless infrastructure) at substantially any time for providing a new collection (i.e., cluster) of wireless signal characteristics to be associated with the verified location for the transceiver. Alternatively, repeatable loc sigs may be obtained by, for example, obtaining location signal measurements manually from workers who regularly traverse a predetermined route through some portion of the radio coverage area; i.e., postal workers.",
        "A loc sig is random if the loc sig is not repeatable. Random loc sigs are obtained, for example, from verifying a previously unknown target MS location once the MS 140 has been located. Such verifications may be accomplished by, for example, a vehicle having one or more location verifying devices such as a GPS receiver and/or a manual location input capability becoming sufficiently close to the located target MS 140 so that the location of the vehicle may be associated with the wireless signal characteristics of the MS 140. Vehicles having such location detection devices may include: (a) vehicles that travel to locations that are primarily for another purpose than to verify loc sigs, e.g., police cars, ambulances, fire trucks, rescue units, courier services and taxis; and/or (b) vehicles whose primary purpose is to verify loc sigs; e.g., location signal calibration vehicles. Additionally, vehicles having both wireless transceivers and location verifying devices may provide the location center 142 with random loc sigs. Note, a repeatable loc sig may become a random loc sig if an MS 140 at the location associated with the loc sig becomes undetectable such as, for example, when the MS 140 is removed from its verified location and therefore the loc sig for the location can not be readily updated.",
        "Additionally, note that at least in one embodiment of the signal topography characteristics (25.7) above, such a first surface may be generated for the (forward) signals from the base station 122 to the target MS 140 and a second such surface may be generated for (or alternatively, the first surface may be enhanced by increasing its dimensionality with) the signals from the MS 140 to the base station 122 (denoted the reverse signals).",
        "Additionally, in some embodiments the location hypothesis may include an estimated error as a measurement of perceived accuracy in addition to or as a substitute for the confidence field discussed hereinabove. Moreover, location hypotheses may also include a text field for providing a reason for the values of one or more of the location hypothesis fields. For example, this text field may provide a reason as to why the confidence value is low, or provide an indication that the wireless signal measurements used had a low signal to noise ratio.",
        "Loc sigs have the following functions or object methods associated therewith:\n\n    (26.1) A \u201cnormalization\u201d method for normalizing loc sig data according to the associated MS 140 and/or BS 122 signal processing and generating characteristics. That is, the signal processing subsystem 1220, one embodiment being described in the PCT patent application PCT/US97/15933, titled, \u201cWireless Location Using A Plurality of Commercial Network Infrastructures,\u201d by F. W. LeBlanc and the present inventors, filed Sep. 8, 1997 (which has a U.S. national filing that is now U.S. Pat. No. 6,236,365, filed Jul. 8, 1999, note, both PCT/US97/15933 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,236,365 are incorporated fully by reference herein) provides (methods for loc sig objects) for \u201cnormalizing\u201d each loc sig so that variations in signal characteristics resulting from variations in (for example) MS signal processing and generating characteristics of different types of MS's may be reduced. In particular, since wireless network designers are typically designing networks for effective use of hand set MS's 140 having a substantially common minimum set of performance characteristics, the normalization methods provided here transform the loc sig data so that it appears as though the loc sig was provided by a common hand set MS 140. However, other methods may also be provided to \u201cnormalize\u201d a loc sig so that it may be compared with loc sigs obtained from other types of MS's as well. Note that such normalization techniques include, for example, interpolating and extrapolating according to power levels so that loc sigs may be normalized to the same power level for, e.g., comparison purposes. Normalization for the BS 122 associated with a loc sig is similar to the normalization for MS signal processing and generating characteristics. Just as with the MS normalization, the signal processing subsystem 1220 provides a loc sig method for \u201cnormalizing\u201d loc sigs according to base station signal processing and generating characteristics.",
        "Note, however, loc sigs stored in the location signature data base 1320 are NOT \u201cnormalized\u201d according to either MS or BS signal processing and generating characteristics. That is, \u201craw\u201d values of the wireless signal characteristics are stored with each loc sig in the location signature data base 1320.\n\n    (26.2) A method for determining the \u201carea type\u201d corresponding to the signal transmission characteristics of the area(s) between the associated BS 122 and the associated MS 140 location for the loc sig. Note, such an area type may be designated by, for example, the techniques for determining transmission area types as described hereinabove.\n    (26.3) Other methods are contemplated for determining additional environmental characteristics of the geographical area between the associated BS 122 and the associated MS 140 location for the loc sig; e.g., a noise value indicating the amount of noise likely in such an area.",
        "Referring now to the composite location objects and verified location signature clusters of (24.3) and (24.2) respectively, the following information is contained in these aggregation objects:\n\n    (27.1.1) an identification of the BS 122 designated as the primary base station for communicating with the target MS 140;\n    (27.1.2) a reference to each loc sig in the location signature data base 1320 that is for the same MS location at substantially the same time with the primary BS as identified in (27.1);\n    (27.1.3) an identification of each base station (e.g., 122 and 152) that can be detected by the MS 140 at the time the location signal measurements are obtained. Note that in one embodiment, each composite location object includes a bit string having a corresponding bit for each base station, wherein a \u201c1\u201d for such a bit indicates that the corresponding base station was identified by the MS, and a \u201c0\u201d indicates that the base station was not identified. In an alternative embodiment, additional location signal measurements may also be included from other non-primary base stations. For example, the target MS 140 may communicate with other base stations than it's primary base station. However, since the timing for the MS 140 is typically derived from it's primary base station and since timing synchronization between base stations is not exact (e.g., in the case of CDMA, timing variations may be plus or minus 1 microsecond)at least some of the location signal measurements may be less reliable that the measurements from the primary base station, unless a forced hand-off technique is used to eliminate system timing errors among relevant base stations;\n    (27.1.4) a completeness designation that indicates whether any loc sigs for the composite location object have been removed from (or invalidated in) the location signature data base 1320.",
        "Note, a verified composite location object is designated as \u201cincomplete\u201d if a loc sig initially referenced by the verified composite location object is deleted from the location signature data base 1320 (e.g., because of a confidence that is too low). Further note that if all loc sigs for a composite location object are deleted, then the composite object is also deleted from the location signature data base 1320. Also note that common fields between loc sigs referenced by the same composite location object may be provided in the composite location object only (e.g., timestamp, etc.).",
        "Accordingly, a composite location object that is complete (i.e., not incomplete) is a verified location signature cluster as described in (24.2).",

In addressing the design goals of extensibility and flexibility, the high level architecture for generating and processing MS location estimates may be considered as divided into the following high level functional groups described hereinbelow.",
        "Low Level Wireless Signal Processing Subsystem for Receiving and Conditioning Wireless Signal Measurements",
        "A first functional group of location engine 139 modules is for performing signal processing and filtering of MS location signal data received from a conventional wireless (e.g., CDMA) infrastructure, as discussed in the steps (23.1) and (23.2) above. This group is denoted the signal processing subsystem 1220 herein. One embodiment of such a subsystem is described in the PCT patent application titled, \u201cWireless Location Using A Plurality of Commercial Network Infrastructures,\u201d by F. W. LeBlanc and the present inventors.",
        "Initial Location Estimators: First Order Models",
        "A second functional group of location engine 139 modules is for generating various target MS 140 location initial estimates, as described in step (23.3). Accordingly, the modules here use input provided by the signal processing subsystem 1220. This second functional group includes one or more signal analysis modules or models, each hereinafter denoted as a first order model 1224 (FOM), for generating location hypotheses for a target MS 140 to be located. Note that it is intended that each such FOM 1224 use a different technique for determining a location area estimate for the target MS 140. A brief description of some types of first order models is provided immediately below. Note that FIGS. 8 illustrates another, more detailed view of the location system for the present invention. In particular, this figure illustrates some of the FOMs 1224 contemplated by the present invention, and additionally illustrates the primary communications with other modules of the location system for the present invention. However, it is important to note that the present invention is not limited to the FOMs 1224 shown and discussed herein. That is, it is a primary aspect of the present invention to easily incorporate FOMs using other signal processing and/or computational location estimating techniques than those presented herein. Further, note that each FOM type may have a plurality of its models incorporated into an embodiment of the present invention.",
        "For example, (as will be described in further detail below), one such type of model or FOM 1224 (hereinafter models of this type are referred to as \u201cdistance models\u201d) may be based on a range or distance computation and/or on a base station signal reception angle determination between the target MS 140 from each of one or more base stations. Basically, such distance models 1224 determine a location estimate of the target MS 140 by determining a distance offset from each of one or more base stations 122, possibly in a particular direction from each (some of) the base stations, so that an intersection of each area locus defined by the base station offsets may provide an estimate of the location of the target MS. Distance model FOMs 1224 may compute such offsets based on:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) signal timing measurements between the target mobile station 140 and one or more base stations 122; e.g., timing measurements such as time difference of arrival (TDOA), or time of arrival (TOA). Note that both forward and reverse signal path timing measurements may be utilized;\n        (b) signal strength measurements (e.g., relative to power control settings of the MS 140 and/or one or more BS 122); and/or\n        (c) signal angle of arrival measurements, or ranges thereof, at one or more base stations 122 (such angles and/or angular ranges provided by, e.g., base station antenna sectors having angular ranges of 120\u00b0 or 60\u00b0, or, so called \u201cSMART antennas\u201d with variable angular transmission ranges of 2\u00b0 to 120\u00b0).",
        "Accordingly, a distance model may utilize triangulation or trilateration to compute a location hypothesis having either an area location or a point location for an estimate of the target MS 140. Additionally, in some embodiments location hypothesis may include an estimated error",
        "In one embodiment, such a distance model may perform the following steps:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) Determines a minimum distance between the target MS and each BS using TOA, TDOA, signal strength on both forward and reverse paths;\n        (b) Generates an estimated error;\n        (c) Outputs a location hypothesis for estimating a location of a MS: each such hypothesis having: (i) one or more (nested) location area estimates for the MS, each location estimate having a confidence value (e.g., provided using the estimated error) indicating a perceived accuracy, and (ii) a reason for both the location estimate (e.g., substantial multipath, etc) and the confidence.",
        "Another type of FOM 1224 is a statistically based first order model 1224, wherein a statistical technique, such as regression techniques (e.g., least squares, partial least squares, principle decomposition), or e.g., Bollenger Bands (e.g., for computing minimum and maximum base station offsets). In general, models of this type output location hypotheses that are determined by performing one or more statistical techniques or comparisons between the verified location signatures in location signature data base 1320, and the wireless signal measurements from a target MS. Models of this type are also referred to hereinafter as a \u201cstochastic signal (first order) model\u201d or a \u201cstochastic FOM\u201d or a \u201cstatistical model.\u201d",
        "In one embodiment, such a stochastic signal model may output location hypotheses determined by one or more statistical comparisons with loc sigs in the Location Signature database 1320 (e.g., comparing MS location signals with verified signal characteristics for predetermined geographical areas).",
        "Still another type of FOM 1224 is an adaptive learning model, such as an artificial neural net or a genetic algorithm, wherein the FOM may be trained to recognize or associate each of a plurality of locations with a corresponding set of signal characteristics for communications between the target MS 140 (at the location) and the base stations 122. Moreover, typically such a FOM is expected to accurately interpolate/extrapolate target MS 140 location estimates from a set of signal characteristics from an unknown target MS 140 location. Models of this type are also referred to hereinafter variously as \u201cartificial neural net models\u201d or \u201cneural net models\u201d or \u201ctrainable models\u201d or \u201clearning models.\u201d Note that a related type of FOM 1224 is based on pattern recognition. These FOMs can recognize patterns in the signal characteristics of communications between the target MS 140 (at the location) and the base stations 122 and thereby estimate a location area of the target MS. However, such FOMs may not be trainable.",
        "In one embodiment, an adaptive learning model such as a model based on an artificial neural network may determine an MS 140 location estimate using base station IDs, data on signal-to-noise, other signal data (e.g., a number of signal characteristics including, e.g., all CDMA fingers). Moreover, the output from such a model may include: a latitude and longitude for a center of a circle having radius R (R may be an input to such an artificial neural network), and is in the output format of the distance model(s).",
        "Yet another type of FOM 1224 can be based on a collection of dispersed low power, low cost fixed location wireless transceivers (also denoted \u201clocation base stations 152\u201d hereinabove) that are provided for detecting a target MS 140 in areas where, e.g., there is insufficient base station 122 infrastructure coverage for providing a desired level of MS 140 location accuracy. For example, it may uneconomical to provide high traffic wireless voice coverage of a typical wireless base station 122 in a nature preserve or at a fair ground that is only populated a few days out of the year. However, if such low cost location base stations 152 can be directed to activate and deactivate via the direction of a FOM 1224 of the present type, then these location base stations can be used to both locate a target MS 140 and also provide indications of where the target MS is not. For example, if there are location base stations 152 populating an area where the target MS 140 is presumed to be, then by activating these location base stations 152, evidence may be obtained as to whether or not the target MS is actually in the area; e.g., if the target MS 140 is detected by a location base station 152, then a corresponding location hypothesis having a location estimate corresponding to the coverage area of the location base station may have a very high confidence value. Alternatively, if the target MS 140 is not detected by a location base station 152, then a corresponding location hypothesis having a location estimate corresponding to the coverage area of the location base station may have a very low confidence value. Models of this type are referred to hereinafter as \u201clocation base station models.\u201d",
        "In one embodiment, such a location base station model may perform the following steps:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) If an input is received then the target MS 140 is detected by a location base station 152 (i.e., a LBS being a unit having a reduced power BS and a MS).\n        (b) If an input is obtained, then the output is a hypothesis data structure having a small area of the highest confidence.\n        (c) If no input is received from a LBS then a hypothesis having an area with highest negative confidence is output.",
        "Yet another type of FOM 1224 can be based on input from a mobile base station 148, wherein location hypotheses may be generated from target MS 140 location data received from the mobile base station 148. In one embodiment, such a mobile base station model may provide output similar to the distance FOM 1224 described hereinabove.",
        "Still other types of FOM 1224 can be based on various techniques for recognizing wireless signal measurement patterns and associating particular patterns with locations in the coverage area 120. For example, artificial neural networks or other learning models can used as the basis for various FOMs.",
        "Note that the FOM types mentioned here as well as other FOM types are discussed in detail hereinbelow. Moreover, it is important to keep in mind that a novel aspect of the present invention is the simultaneous use or activation of a potentially large number of such first order models 1224, wherein such FOMs are not limited to those described herein. Thus, the present invention provides a framework for incorporating MS location estimators to be subsequently provided as new FOMs in a straightforward manner. For example, a FOM 1224 based on wireless signal time delay measurements from a distributed antenna system 168 for wireless communication may be incorporated into the present invention for locating a target MS 140 in an enclosed area serviced by the distributed antenna system (such a FOM is more fully described in the U.S. Pat. No. 6,236,365 filed Jul. 8, 1999 which is incorporated fully by reference herein). Accordingly, by using such a distributed antenna FOM 1224 (FIG. 8(l)), the present invention may determine the floor of a multi-story building from which a target MS is transmitting. Thus, MSs 140 can be located in three dimensions using such a distributed antenna FOM 1224.",
        "In one embodiment, such a distributed antenna model may perform the following steps:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) Receives input only from a distributed antenna system.\n        (b) If an input is received, then the output includes a lat-long and height of highest confidence.",
        "Additionally, FOMs 1224 for detecting certain registration changes within, for example, a public switched telephone network 124 can also be used for locating a target MS 140. For example, for some MSs 140 there may be an associated or dedicated device for each such MS that allows the MS to function as a cordless phone to a line based telephone network when the device detects that the MS is within signaling range. In one use of such a device (also denoted herein as a \u201chome base station\u201d), the device registers with a home location register of the public switched telephone network 124 when there is a status change such as from not detecting the corresponding MS to detecting the MS, or visa versa, as one skilled in the art will understand. Accordingly, by providing a FOM 1224 (denoted the \u201cHome Base Station First Order Model\u201d in FIG. 8(l)) that accesses the MS status in the home location register, the location engine 139 can determine whether the MS is within signaling range of the home base station or not, and generate location hypotheses accordingly.",
        "In one embodiment, such a home base station model may perform the following steps:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) Receives an input only from the Public Telephone Switching Network.\n        (b) If an input is received then the target MS 140 is detected by a home base station associated with the target MS.\n        (c) If an input is obtained, then the output is a hypothesis data structure having a small area of the highest confidence.\n        (d) If no input and there is a home base station then a hypothesis having a negative area is of highest confidence is output.",
        "Moreover, other FOMs based on, for example, chaos theory and/or fractal theory are also within the scope of the present invention.",
        "It is important to note the following aspects of the present invention relating to FOMs 1224:\n\n    (28.1) Each such first order model 1224 may be relatively easily incorporated into and/or removed from the present invention. For example, assuming that the signal processing subsystem 1220 provides uniform input interface to the FOMs, and there is a uniform FOM output interface, it is believed that a large majority (if not substantially all) viable MS location estimation strategies may be accommodated. Thus, it is straightforward to add or delete such FOMs 1224.\n    (28.2) Each such first order model 1224 may be relatively simple and still provide significant MS 140 locating functionality and predictability. For example, much of what is believed to be common or generic MS location processing has been coalesced into, for example: a location hypothesis evaluation subsystem, denoted the hypotheses evaluator 1228 and described immediately below. Thus, the present invention is modular and extensible such that, for example, (and importantly) different first order models 1224 may be utilized depending on the signal transmission characteristics of the geographic region serviced by an embodiment of the present invention. Thus, a simple configuration of the present invention may have a small number of FOMs 1224 for a simple wireless signal environment (e.g., flat terrain, no urban canyons and low population density). Alternatively, for complex wireless signal environments such as in cities like San Francisco, Tokyo or New York, a large number of FOMs 1224 may be simultaneously utilized for generating MS location hypotheses.\n\nAn Introduction to an Evaluator for Location Hypotheses: Hypothesis Evaluator",
        "A third functional group of location engine 139 modules evaluates location hypotheses output by the first order models 1224 and thereby provides a \u201cmost likely\u201d target MS location estimate. The modules for this functional group are collectively denoted the hypothesis evaluator 1228.",
        "Hypothesis Evaluator Introduction",
        "A primary purpose of the hypothesis evaluator 1228 is to mitigate conflicts and ambiguities related to location hypotheses output by the first order models 1224 and thereby output a \u201cmost likely\u201d estimate of an MS for which there is a request for it to be located. In providing this capability, there are various related embodiments of the hypothesis evaluator that are within the scope of the present invention. Since each location hypothesis includes both an MS location area estimate and a corresponding confidence value indicating a perceived confidence or likelihood of the target MS being within the corresponding location area estimate, there is a monotonic relationship between MS location area estimates and confidence values. That is, by increasing an MS location area estimate, the corresponding confidence value may also be increased (in an extreme case, the location area estimate could be the entire coverage area 120 and thus the confidence value may likely correspond to the highest level of certainty; i.e., +1.0). Accordingly, given a target MS location area estimate (of a location hypothesis), an adjustment to its accuracy may be performed by adjusting the MS location area estimate and/or the corresponding confidence value. Thus, if the confidence value is, for example, excessively low then the area estimate may be increased as a technique for increasing the confidence value. Alternatively, if the estimated area is excessively large, and there is flexibility in the corresponding confidence value, then the estimated area may be decreased and the confidence value also decreased. Thus, if at some point in the processing of a location hypothesis, if the location hypothesis is judged to be more (less) accurate than initially determined, then (i) the confidence value of the location hypothesis can be increased (decreased), and/or (ii) the MS location area estimate can be decreased (increased).",
        "In a first class of embodiments, the hypothesis evaluator 1228 evaluates location hypotheses and adjusts or modifies only their confidence values for MS location area estimates and subsequently uses these MS location estimates with the adjusted confidence values for determining a \u201cmost likely\u201d MS location estimate for outputting. Accordingly, the MS location area estimates are not substantially modified. Alternatively, in a second class of embodiments for the hypothesis evaluator 1228, MS location area estimates can be adjusted while confidence values remain substantially fixed. Of course, hybrids between the first two embodiments can also be provided. Note that the present embodiment provided herein adjusts both the areas and the confidence values.",
        "More particularly, the hypothesis evaluator 1228 may perform any or most of the following tasks:\n\n    (30.1) it utilizes environmental information to improve and reconcile location hypotheses supplied by the first order models 1224. A basic premise in this context is that the accuracy of the individual first order models may be affected by various environmental factors such as, for example, the season of the year, the time of day, the weather conditions, the presence of buildings, base station failures, etc.;\n    (30.2) it enhances the accuracy of an initial location hypothesis generated by a FOM by using the initial location hypothesis as, essentially, a query or index into the location signature data base 1320 for obtaining a corresponding enhanced location hypothesis, wherein the enhanced location hypothesis has both an adjusted target MS location area estimate and an adjusted confidence based on past performance of the FOM in the location service surrounding the target MS location estimate of the initial location hypothesis;\n    (30.3) it determines how well the associated signal characteristics used for locating a target MS compare with particular verified loc sig stored in the location signature data base 1320 (see the location signature data base section for further discussion regarding this aspect of the invention). That is, for a given location hypothesis, verified loc sigs (which were previously obtained from one or more verified locations of one or more MS's) are retrieved for an area corresponding to the location area estimate of the location hypothesis, and the signal characteristics of these verified loc sigs are compared with the signal characteristics used to generate the location hypothesis for determining their similarities and subsequently an adjustment to the confidence of the location hypothesis (and/or the size of the location area estimate);\n    (30.4) the hypothesis evaluator 1228 determines if (or how well) such location hypotheses are consistent with well known physical constraints such as the laws of physics. For example, if the difference between a previous (most likely) location estimate of a target MS and a location estimate by a current location hypothesis requires the MS to:\n    \n        (a1) move at an unreasonably high rate of speed (e.g., 200 mph), or\n        (b1) move at an unreasonably high rate of speed for an area (e.g., 80 mph in a corn patch), or\n        (c1) make unreasonably sharp velocity changes (e.g., from 60 mph in one direction to 60 mph in the opposite direction in 4 sec), then the confidence in the current Location Hypothesis is likely to be reduced.",
        "Alternatively, if for example, the difference between a previous location estimate of a target MS and a current location hypothesis indicates that the MS is:\n\n    \n    \n        (a2) moving at an appropriate velocity for the area being traversed, or\n        (b2) moving along an established path (e.g., a freeway), then the confidence in the current location hypothesis may be increased.\n    \n    \n    (30.5) the hypothesis evaluator 1228 determines consistencies and inconsistencies between location hypotheses obtained from different first order models. For example, if two such location hypotheses, for substantially the same timestamp, have estimated location areas where the target MS is likely to be and these areas substantially overlap, then the confidence in both such location hypotheses may be increased. Additionally, note that a velocity of an MS may be determined (via deltas of successive location hypotheses from one or more first order models) even when there is low confidence in the location estimates for the MS, since such deltas may, in some cases, be more reliable than the actual target MS location estimates;\n    (30.6) the hypothesis evaluator 1228 determines new (more accurate) location hypotheses from other location hypotheses. For example, this module may generate new hypotheses from currently active ones by decomposing a location hypothesis having a target MS location estimate intersecting two radically different area types. Additionally, this module may generate location hypotheses indicating areas of poor reception; and\n    (30.7) the hypothesis evaluator 1228 determines and outputs a most likely location hypothesis for a target MS. Note that the hypothesis evaluator may accomplish the above tasks, (30.1)\u2013(30.7), by employing various data processing tools including, but not limited to, fuzzy mathematics, genetic algorithms, neural networks, expert systems and/or blackboard systems.",
        "Note that, as can be seen in FIGS. 6 and 7, the hypothesis evaluator 1228 includes the following four high level modules for processing output location hypotheses from the first order models 1224: a context adjuster 1326, a hypothesis analyzer 1332, an MS status repository 1338 and a most likelihood estimator 1334. These four modules are briefly described hereinbelow.",
        "Context Adjuster Introduction.",
        "The context adjuster 1326 module enhances both the comparability and predictability of the location hypotheses output by the first order models 1224. In particular, this module modifies location hypotheses received from the FOMs 1224 so that the resulting location hypotheses output by the context adjuster 1326 may be further processed uniformly and substantially without concern as to differences in accuracy between the first order models from which location hypotheses originate. In providing this capability, the context adjuster 1326 may adjust or modify various fields of the input location hypotheses. In particular, fields giving target MS 140 location estimates and/or confidence values for such estimates may be modified by the context adjuster 1326. Further, this module may determine those factors that are perceived to impact the perceived accuracy (e.g., confidence) of the location hypotheses: (a) differently between FOMs, and/or (b) with substantial effect. For instance, environmental characteristics may be taken into account here, such as time of day, season, month, weather, geographical area categorizations (e.g., dense urban, urban, suburban, rural, mountain, etc.), area subcategorizations (e.g., heavily treed, hilly, high traffic area, etc.). A detailed description of one embodiment of this module is provided in APPENDIX D hereinbelow. Note that, the embodiment described herein is simplified for illustration purposes such that only the geographical area categorizations are utilized in adjusting (i.e., modifying) location hypotheses. But, it is an important aspect of the present invention that various categorizations, such as those mentioned immediately above, may be used for adjusting the location hypotheses. That is, categories such as, for example:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) urban, hilly, high traffic at 5 pm, or\n        (b) rural, flat, heavy tree foliage density in summer may be utilized as one skilled in the art will understand from the descriptions contained hereinbelow.",
        "Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to the factors explicitly mentioned here. That is, it is an aspect of the present invention to be extensible so that other environmental factors of the coverage area 120 affecting the accuracy of location hypotheses may also be incorporated into the context adjuster 1326.",
        "It is also an important and novel aspect of the context adjuster 1326 that the methods for adjusting location hypotheses provided in this module may be generalized and thereby also utilized with multiple hypothesis computational architectures related to various applications wherein a terrain, surface, volume or other \u201cgeometric\u201d interpretation (e.g., a metric space of statistical samples) may be placed on a large body of stored application data for relating hypothesized data to verified data Moreover, it is important to note that various techniques for \u201cvisualizing data\u201d may provide such a geometric interpretation. Thus, the methods herein may be utilized in applications such as:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) sonar, radar, x-ray or infrared identification of objects such as occurs in robotic navigation, medical image analysis, geological, and radar imaging.",
        "More generally, the novel computational paradigm of the context adjuster 1326 may be utilized in a number of applications wherein there is a large body of archived information providing verified or actual application process data related to the past performance of the application process.",
        "It is worth mentioning that the computational paradigm used in the context adjuster 1326 is a hybrid of a hypothesis adjuster and a data base query mechanism. For example, the context adjuster 1326 uses an input (location) hypothesis both as an hypothesis and as a data base query or index into the location signature data base 1320 for constructing a related but more accurate location hypothesis. Accordingly, substantial advantages are provided by this hybrid architecture, such as the following two advantages.",
        "As a first advantage, the context adjuster 1326 reduces the likelihood that a feedback mechanism is necessary to the initial hypothesis generators (i.e., FOMs 1224) for periodically adjusting default evaluations of the goodness or confidence in the hypotheses generated. That is, since each hypothesis generated is, in effect, an index into a data base or archive of verified application (e.g., location) data, the context adjuster 1326, in turn, generates new corresponding hypotheses based on the actual or verified data retrieved from an archival data base. Thus, as a result, this architecture tends to separate the computations of the initial hypothesis generators (e.g., the FOMs 1224 in the present MS location application) from any further processing and thereby provide a more modular, maintainable and flexible computational system.",
        "As a second advantage, the context adjuster 1326 tends to create hypotheses that are more accurate than the hypotheses generated by the initial hypotheses generators. That is, for each hypothesis, H, provided by one of the initial hypothesis generators, G (e.g., a FOM 1224), a corresponding enhanced hypothesis, provided by the context adjuster 1326, is generated by mapping the past performance of G into the archived verified application data (as will be discussed in detail hereinbelow). In particular, the context adjuster hypothesis generation is based on the archived verified (or known) performance application data that is related to both G and H. For example, in the present wireless location application, if a FOM 1224, G, substantially consistently generates, in a particular geographical area, location hypotheses that are biased approximately 1000 feet north of the actual verified MS 140 location, then the context adjuster 1326 can generate corresponding hypotheses without this bias. Thus, the context adjuster 1326 tends to filter out inaccuracies in the initially generated hypotheses.",
        "Therefore in a multiple hypothesis architecture where typically the generated hypotheses may be evaluated and/or combined for providing a \u201cmost likely\u201d result, it is believed that a plurality of relatively simple (and possibly inexact) initial hypothesis generators may be used in conjunction with the hybrid computational paradigm represented by the context adjuster 1326 for providing enhanced hypotheses with substantially greater accuracy.",
        "Additionally, note that this hybrid paradigm applies to other domains that are not geographically based. For instance, this hybrid paradigm applies to many prediction and/or diagnostic applications for which:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) the application data and the application are dependent on a number of parameters whose values characterize the range of outputs for the application. That is, there is a set of parameters, p1,p2,p3, . . . ,pN from which a parameter space p1\u00d7p2\u00d7p3\u00d7. . . \u00d7pN is derived whose points characterize the actual and estimated (or predicted) outcomes. As examples, in the MS location system, p1=latitude and p2=longitude;\n        (b) there is historical data from which points for the parameter space, p1\u00d7p2\u00d7p3\u00d7. . . \u00d7pN can be obtained, wherein this data relates to (or indicates) the performance of the application, and the points obtained from this data are relatively dense in the space (at least around the likely future actual outcomes that the application is expected to predict or diagnose). For example, such historical data may associate the predicted outcomes of the application with corresponding actual outcomes;\n        (c) there is a metric or distance-like evaluation function that can be applied to the parameter space for indicating relative closeness or accuracy of points in the parameter space, wherein the evaluation function provides a measurement of closeness that is related to the actual performance of the application.",
        "Note that there are numerous applications for which the above criteria are applicable. For instance, computer aided control of chemical processing plants are likely to satisfy the above criteria. Certain robotic applications may also satisfy this criteria. In fact, it is believed that a wide range of signal processing applications satisfy this criteria.",
        "MS Status Repository Introduction",
        "The MS status repository 1338 is a run-time storage manager for storing location hypotheses from previous activations of the location engine 139 (as well as for storing the output \u201cmost likely\u201d target MS location estimate(s)) so that a target MS 140 may be tracked using target MS location hypotheses from previous location engine 139 activations to determine, for example, a movement of the target MS 140 between evaluations of the target MS location.",
        "Location Hypothesis Analyzer Introduction",
        "The location hypothesis analyzer 1332, adjusts confidence values of the location hypotheses, according to:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) heuristics and/or statistical methods related to how well the signal characteristics for the generated target MS location hypothesis matches with previously obtained signal characteristics for verified MS locations.\n        (b) heuristics related to how consistent the location hypothesis is with physical laws, and/or highly probable reasonableness conditions relating to the location of the target MS and its movement characteristics. For example, such heuristics may utilize knowledge of the geographical terrain in which the MS is estimated to be, and/or, for instance, the MS velocity, acceleration or extrapolation of an MS position, velocity, or acceleration.\n        (c) generation of additional location hypotheses whose MS locations are consistent with, for example, previous estimated locations for the target MS.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the hypothesis analyzer 1332 module receives (potentially) modified location hypotheses from the context adjuster 1326 and performs additional location hypothesis processing that is likely to be common and generic in analyzing most location hypotheses. More specifically, the hypothesis analyzer 1332 may adjust either or both of the target MS 140 estimated location and/or the confidence of a location hypothesis. In brief, the hypothesis analyzer 1332 receives target MS 140 location hypotheses from the context analyzer 1336, and depending on the time stamps of newly received location hypotheses and any previous (i.e., older) target MS location hypotheses that may still be currently available to the hypothesis analyzer 1332, the hypothesis analyzer may:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) update some of the older hypotheses by an extrapolation module,\n        (b) utilize some of the old hypotheses as previous target MS estimates for use in tracking the target MS 140, and/or\n        (c) if sufficiently old, then delete the older location hypotheses.",
        "Note that both the newly received location hypotheses and the previous location hypotheses that are updated (i.e., extrapolated) and still remain in the hypothesis analyzer 1332 will be denoted as \u201ccurrent location hypotheses\u201d or \u201ccurrently active location hypotheses\u201d.",
        "The modules within the location hypothesis analyzer 1332 use various types of application specific knowledge likely substantially independent from the computations by the FOMs 1224 when providing the corresponding original location hypotheses. That is, since it is aspect of at least one embodiment of the present invention that the FOMs 1224 be relatively straightforward so that they may be easily to modified as well as added or deleted, the processing, for example, in the hypothesis analyzer 1332 (as with the context adjuster 1326) is intended to compensate, when necessary, for this straightforwardness by providing substantially generic MS location processing capabilities that can require a greater breadth of application understanding related to wireless signal characteristics of the coverage area 120.",
        "Accordingly, the hypothesis analyzer 1332 may apply various heuristics that, for example, change the confidence in a location hypothesis depending on how well the location hypothesis (and/or a series of location hypotheses from e.g., the same FOM 1224): (a) conforms with the laws of physics, (b) conforms with known characteristics of location signature clusters in an area of the location hypothesis MS 140 estimate, and (c) conforms with highly likely heuristic constraint knowledge. In particular, as illustrated best in FIG. 7, the location hypothesis analyzer 1332 may utilize at least one of a blackboard system and/or an expert system for applying various application specific heuristics to the location hypotheses output by the context adjuster 1326. More precisely, the location hypothesis analyzer 1332 includes, in one embodiment, a blackboard manager for managing processes and data of a blackboard system. Additionally, note that in a second embodiment, where an expert system is utilized instead of a blackboard system, the location hypothesis analyzer provides an expert system inference engine for the expert system. Note that additional detail on these aspects of the invention are provided hereinbelow.",
        "Additionally, note that the hypothesis analyzer 1332 may activate one or more extrapolation procedures to extrapolate target MS 140 location hypotheses already processed. Thus, when one or more new location hypotheses are supplied (by the context adjuster 1224) having a substantially more recent timestamp, the hypothesis analyzer may invoke an extrapolation module (i.e., location extrapolator 1432, FIG. 7) for adjusting any previous location hypotheses for the same target MS 140 that are still being used by the location hypothesis analyzer so that all target MS location hypotheses (for the same target MS) being concurrently analyzed are presumed to be for substantially the same time. Accordingly, such a previous location hypothesis that is, for example, 15 seconds older than a newly supplied location hypothesis (from perhaps a different FOM 1224) may have both: (a) an MS location estimate changed (e.g., to account for a movement of the target MS), and (b) its confidence changed (e.g., to reflect a reduced confidence in the accuracy of the location hypothesis).",
        "It is important to note that the architecture of the present invention is such that the hypothesis analyzer 1332 has an extensible architecture. That is, additional location hypothesis analysis modules may be easily integrated into the hypothesis analyzer 1332 as further understanding regarding the behavior of wireless signals within the service area 120 becomes available. Conversely, some analysis modules may not be required in areas having relatively predictable signal patterns. Thus, in such service areas, such unnecessary modules may be easily removed or not even developed.",
        "Most Likelihood Estimator Introduction",
        "The most likelihood estimator 1344 is a module for determining a \u201cmost likely\u201d location estimate for a target MS being located by the location engine 139. The most likelihood estimator 1344 receives a collection of active or relevant location hypotheses from the hypothesis analyzer 1332 and uses these location hypotheses to determine one or more most likely estimates for the target MS 140. Still referring to the hypothesis evaluator 1228, it is important to note that not all the above mentioned modules are required in all embodiments of the present invention. In particular, for some coverage areas 120, the hypothesis analyzer 1332 may be unnecessary. Accordingly, in such an embodiment, the enhanced location hypothesis output by the context adjuster 1326 are provided directly to the most likelihood estimator 1344.",
        "Control and Output Gating Modules",
        "A fourth functional group of location engine 139 modules is the control and output gating modules which includes the location center control subsystem 1350, and the output gateway 1356. The location control subsystem 1350 provides the highest level of control and monitoring of the data processing performed by the location center 142. In particular, this subsystem performs the following functions:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) controls and monitors location estimating processing for each target MS 140. Note that this includes high level exception or error handling functions;\n        (b) receives and routes external information as necessary. For instance, this subsystem may receive (via, e.g., the public telephone switching network 124 and Internet 468) such environmental information as increased signal noise in a particular service area due to increase traffic, a change in weather conditions, a base station 122 (or other infrastructure provisioning), change in operation status (e.g., operational to inactive);\n        (c) receives and directs location processing requests from other location centers 142 (via, e.g., the Internet 468);\n        (d) performs accounting and billing procedures;\n        (e) interacts with location center operators by, for example, receiving operator commands and providing output indicative of processing resources being utilized and malfunctions;\n        (f) provides access to output requirements for various applications requesting location estimates. For example, an Internet 468 location request from a trucking company in Los Angeles to a location center 142 in Denver may only want to know if a particular truck or driver is within the Denver area. Alternatively, a local medical rescue unit is likely to request a precise a location estimate as possible.",
        "Note that in FIG. 6, (a)\u2013(d) above are, at least at a high level, performed by utilizing the operator interface 1374.",
        "Referring now to the output gateway 1356, this module routes target MS 140 location estimates to the appropriate location application(s). For instance, upon receiving a location estimate from the most likelihood estimator 1344, the output gateway 1356 may determine that the location estimate is for an automobile being tracked by the police and therefore must be provided according to a particular protocol.",
        "System Tuning and Adaptation: The Adaptation Engine",
        "A fifth functional group of location engine 139 modules provides the ability to enhance the MS locating reliability and/or accuracy of the present invention by providing it with the capability to adapt to particular operating configurations, operating conditions and wireless signaling environments without performing intensive manual analysis of the performance of various embodiments of the location engine 139. That is, this functional group automatically enhances the performance of the location engine for locating MSs 140 within a particular coverage area 120 using at least one wireless network infrastructure therein. More precisely, this functional group allows the present invention to adapt by tuning or optimizing certain system parameters according to location engine 139 location estimate accuracy and reliability.",
        "There are a number location engine 139 system parameters whose values affect location estimation, and it is an aspect of the present invention that the MS location processing performed should become increasingly better at locating a target MS 140 not only through building an increasingly more detailed model of the signal characteristics of location in the coverage area 120 such as discussed above regarding the location signature data base 1320, but also by providing automated capabilities for the location center processing to adapt by adjusting or \u201ctuning\u201d the values of such location center system parameters.",
        "Accordingly, the present invention includes a module, denoted herein as an \u201cadaptation engine\u201d 1382, that performs an optimization procedure on the location center 142 system parameters either periodically or concurrently with the operation of the location center in estimating MS locations. That is, the adaptation engine 1382 directs the modifications of the system parameters so that the location engine 139 increases in overall accuracy in locating target MSs 140. In one embodiment, the adaptation engine 1382 includes an embodiment of a genetic algorithm as the mechanism for modifying the system parameters. Genetic algorithms are basically search algorithms based on the mechanics of natural genetics. The genetic algorithm utilized herein is included in the form of pseudo code in APPENDIX B. Note that to apply this genetic algorithm in the context of the location engine 139 architecture only a \u201ccoding scheme\u201d and a \u201cfitness function\u201d are required as one skilled in the art will appreciate. Moreover, it is also within the scope of the present invention to use modified or different adaptive and/or tuning mechanisms. For further information regarding such adaptive mechanisms, the following references are incorporated herein by reference: Goldberg, D. E. (1989).

        "Implementations of First Order Models",
        "Further descriptions of various first order models 1224 are provided in this section.",
        "Distance First Order Models (TOA/TDOA)",
        "As discussed in the Location Center Architecture Overview section herein above, distance models determine a presumed direction and/or distance that a target MS 140 is from one or more base stations 122. In some embodiments of distance models, the target MS location estimate(s) generated are obtained using radio signal analysis techniques that are quite general and therefore are not capable of taking into account the peculiarities of the topography of a particular radio coverage area. For example, substantially all radio signal analysis techniques using conventional procedures (or formulas) are based on \u201csignal characteristic measurements\u201d such as:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) signal timing measurements (e.g., TOA and TDOA),\n        (b) signal strength measurements, and/or\n        (c) signal angle of arrival measurements.",
        "Furthermore, such signal analysis techniques are likely predicated on certain very general assumptions that can not fully account for signal attenuation and multipath due to a particular radio coverage area topography.",
        "Taking a CDMA or TDMA base station network as an example, each base station (BS) 122 is required to emit a constant signal-strength pilot channel pseudo-noise (PN) sequence on the forward link channel identified uniquely in the network by a pilot sequence offset and frequency assignment. It is possible to use the pilot channels of the active, candidate, neighboring and remaining sets, maintained in the target MS, for obtaining signal characteristic measurements (e.g., TOA and/or TDOA measurements) between the target MS 140 and the base stations in one or more of these sets.",
        "Based on such signal characteristic measurements and the speed of signal propagation, signal characteristic ranges or range differences related to the location of the target MS 140 can be calculated. Using TOA and/or TDOA ranges as exemplary, these ranges can then be input to either the radius-radius multilateration or the time difference multilateration algorithms along with the known positions of the corresponding base stations 122 to thereby obtain one or more location estimates of the target MS 140. For example, if there are, four base stations 122 in the active set, the target MS 140 may cooperate with each of the base stations in this set to provide signal arrival time measurements. Accordingly, each of the resulting four sets of three of these base stations 122 may be used to provide an estimate of the target MS 140 as one skilled in the art will understand. Thus, potentially (assuming the measurements for each set of three base stations yields a feasible location solution) there are four estimates for the location of the target MS 140. Further, since such measurements and BS 122 positions can be sent either to the network or the target MS 140, location can be determined in either entity.",
        "Since many of the signal measurements utilized by embodiments of distance models are subject to signal attenuation and multipath due to a particular area topography. Many of the sets of base stations from which target MS location estimates are desired may result in either no location estimate, or an inaccurate location estimate.",
        "Accordingly, some embodiments of distance FOMs may attempt to mitigate such ambiguity or inaccuracies by, e.g., identifying discrepancies (or consistencies) between arrival time measurements and other measurements (e.g., signal strength), these discrepancies (or consistencies) may be used to filter out at least those signal measurements and/or generated location estimates that appear less accurate. In particular, such identifying by filtering can be performed by, for example, an expert system residing in the distance FOM.",
        "A second approach for mitigating such ambiguity or conflicting MS location estimates is particularly novel in that each of the target MS location estimates is used to generate a location hypothesis regardless of its apparent accuracy. Accordingly, these location hypotheses are input to an alternative embodiment of the context adjuster 1326 that is substantially (but not identical to) the context adjuster as described in detail in APPENDIX D so that each location hypothesis may be adjusted to enhance its accuracy. In contradistinction to the embodiment of the context adjuster 1326 of APPENDIX D, where each location hypothesis is adjusted according to past performance of its generating FOM 1224 in an area of the initial location estimate of the location hypothesis (the area, e.g., determined as a function of distance from this initial location estimate), this alternative embodiment adjusts each of the location hypotheses generated by a distance first order model according to a past performance of the model as applied to signal characteristic measurements from the same set of base stations 122 as were used in generating the location hypothesis. That is, instead of only using only an identification of the distance model (i.e., its FOM_ID) to, for example, retrieve archived location estimates generated by the model in an area of the location hypothesis' estimate (when determining the model's past performance), the retrieval retrieves only the archived location estimates that are, in addition, derived from the signal characteristics measurement obtained from the same collection of base stations 122 as was used in generating the location hypothesis. Thus, the adjustment performed by this embodiment of the context adjuster 1326 adjusts according to the past performance of the distance model and the collection of base stations 122 used.",
        "Coverage Area First Order Model",
        "Radio coverage area of individual base stations 122 may be used to generate location estimates of the target MS 140. Although a first order model 1224 based on this notion may be less accurate than other techniques, if a reasonably accurate RF coverage area is known for each (or most) of the base stations 122, then such a FOM (denoted hereinafter as a \u201ccoverage area first order model\u201d or simply \u201ccoverage area model\u201d) may be very reliable. To determine approximate maximum radio frequency (RF) location coverage areas, with respect to BSs 122, antennas and/or sector coverage areas, for a given class (or classes) of (e.g., CDMA or TDMA) mobile station(s) 140, location coverage should be based on an MS's ability to adequately detect the pilot channel, as opposed to adequate signal quality for purposes of carrying user-acceptable traffic in the voice channel. Note that more energy is necessary for traffic channel activity (typically on the order of at least \u221294 to \u2212104 dBm received signal strength) to support voice, than energy needed to simply detect a pilot channel's presence for location purposes (typically a maximum weakest signal strength range of between \u2212104 to \u2212110 dBm), thus the \u201cLocation Coverage Area\u201d will generally be a larger area than that of a typical \u201cVoice Coverage Area\u201d, although industry studies have found some occurrences of \u201cno-coverage\u201d areas within a larger covered area. An example of a coverage area including both a \u201cdead zone\u201d, i.e., area of no coverage, and a \u201cnotch\u201d (of also no coverage) is shown in FIG. 15.",
        "The approximate maximum RF coverage area for a given sector of (more generally angular range about) a base station 122 may be represented as a set of points representing a polygonal area (potentially with, e.g., holes therein to account for dead zones and/or notches). Note that if such polygonal RF coverage area representations can be reliably determined and maintained over time (for one or more BS signal power level settings), then such representations can be used in providing a set theoretic or Venn diagram approach to estimating the location of a target MS 140. Coverage area first order models utilize such an approach.",
        "In one embodiment, a coverage area model utilizes both the detection and non-detection of base stations 122 by the target MS 140 (conversely, of the MS by one or more base stations 122) to define an area where the target MS 140 may likely be. A relatively straightforward application of this technique is to:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) find all areas of intersection for base station RE coverage area representations, wherein: (i) the corresponding base stations are on-line for communicating with MSs 140; (ii) the RF coverage area representations are deemed reliable for the power levels of the on-line base stations; (iii) the on-line base stations having reliable coverage area representations can be detected by the target MS; and (iv) each intersection must include a predetermined number of the reliable RF coverage area representations (e.g., 2 or 3); and\n        (b) obtain new location estimates by subtracting from each of the areas of intersection any of the reliable RF coverage area representations for base stations 122 that can not be detected by the target MS.",

        "Location Base Station First Order Model",
        "In the location base station (LBS) model (FOM 1224), a database is accessed which contains electrical, radio propagation and coverage area characteristics of each of the location base stations in the radio coverage area. The LBS model is an active model, in that it can probe or excite one or more particular LBSs 152 in an area for which the target MS 140 to be located is suspected to be placed. Accordingly, the LBS model may receive as input a most likely target MS 140 location estimate previously output by the location engine 139 of the present invention, and use this location estimate to determine which (if any) LBSs 152 to activate and/or deactivate for enhancing a subsequent location estimate of the target MS. Moreover, the feedback from the activated LBSs 152 may be provided to other FOMs 1224, as appropriate, as well as to the LBS model. However, it is an important aspect of the LBS model that when it receives such feedback, it may output location hypotheses having relatively small target MS 140 location area estimates about the active LBSs 152 and each such location hypothesis also has a high confidence value indicative of the target MS 140 positively being in the corresponding location area estimate (e.g., a confidence value of 0.9 to +1), or having a high confidence value indicative of the target MS 140 not being in the corresponding location area estimate (i.e., a confidence value of \u22120.9 to \u22121). Note that in some embodiments of the LBS model, these embodiments may have functionality similar to that of the coverage area first order model described above. Further note that for LBSs within a neighborhood of the target MS wherein there is a reasonable chance that with movement of the target MS may be detected by these LBSs, such LBSs may be requested to periodically activate. (Note, that it is not assumed that such LBSs have an on-line external power source; e.g., some may be solar powered). Moreover, in the case where an LBS 152 includes sufficient electronics to carry voice communication with the target MS 140 and is the primary BS for the target MS (or alternatively, in the active or candidate set), then the LBS model will not deactivate this particular LBS during its procedure of activating and deactivating various LBSs 152.",

Additionally, some embodiments may use Markov processes and Random Walks (predicted incremental MS movement) for determining an expected area within which the target MS 140 is likely to be. That is, such a process measures the incremental time differences of each pilot as the MS moves for predicting a size of a location area estimate using past MS estimates such as the verified location signatures in the location signature data base 1320.",

        "Regarding FOMs 1224 using pattern recognition or associativity techniques, there are many such techniques available. For example, there are statistically based systems such as \u201cCART\u201d (an acronym for Classification and Regression Trees) by ANGOSS Software International Limited of Toronto, Canada that may be used for automatically detecting or recognizing patterns in data that were unprovided (and likely previously unknown). Accordingly, by imposing a relatively fine mesh or grid of cells on the radio coverage area, wherein each cell is entirely within a particular area type categorization such as the transmission area types (discussed in the section, \u201cCoverage Area: Area Types And Their Determination\u201d above), the verified location signature clusters within the cells of each area type may be analyzed for signal characteristic patterns. If such patterns are found, then they can be used to identify at least a likely area type in which a target MS is likely to be located. That is, one or more location hypotheses may be generated having target MS 140 location estimates that cover an area having the likely area type wherein the target MS 140 is located. Further note that such statistically based pattern recognition systems as \u201cCART\u201d include software code generators for generating expert system software embodiments for recognizing the patterns detected within a training set (e.g., the verified location signature clusters).",
        "Accordingly, although an embodiment of a FOM as described here may not be exceedingly accurate, it may be very reliable. Thus, since a fundamental aspect of the present invention is to use a plurality MS location techniques for generating location estimates and to analyze the generated estimates (likely after being adjusted) to detect patterns of convergence or clustering among the estimates, even large MS location area estimates are useful. For example, it can be the case that four different and relatively large MS location estimates, each having very high reliability, have an area of intersection that is acceptably precise and inherits the very high reliability from each of the large MS location estimates from which the intersection area was derived.",
        "A similar statistically based FOM 1224 to the one above may be provided wherein the radio coverage area is decomposed substantially as above, but in addition to using the signal characteristics for detecting useful signal patterns, the specific identifications of the base station 122 providing the signal characteristics may also be used. Thus, assuming there is a sufficient density of verified location signature clusters in some of the mesh cells so that the statistical pattern recognizer can detect patterns in the signal characteristic measurements, an expert system may be generated that outputs a target MS 140 location estimate that may provide both a reliable and accurate location estimate of a target MS 140.",

Accordingly, a data processing component may be \u201cexplicitly adaptive\u201d by modifying its behavior according to the input of explicit instructions or control data that is input for changing the component's subsequent behavior in ways that are predictable and expected.

Alternatively, a data processing component may be \u201cimplicitly adaptive\u201d in that its behavior is modified by other than instructions or control data whose meaning is known by a user of the component. For example, such implicitly adaptive data processors may learn by training on examples, by substantially unguided exploration of a solution space, or other data driven adaptive strategies such as statistically generated decision trees. Accordingly, it is an aspect of the present invention to utilize not only explicitly adaptive MS location estimators within FOMs 1224, but also implicitly adaptive MS location estimators. In particular, artificial neural networks (also denoted neural nets and ANNs herein) are used in some embodiments as implicitly adaptive MS location estimators within FOMs. Thus, in the sections below, neural net architectures and their application to locating an MS is described.",

Accordingly, in one embodiment, a genetic algorithm is used to provide such an adaptation capability.

        "Artificial Neural Networks as MS Location Estimators for First Order Models",
        "Although there have been substantial advances in artificial neural net computing in both hardware and software, it can be difficult to choose a particular ANN architecture and appropriate training data for yielding high quality results. In choosing a ANN architecture at least the following three criteria are chosen (either implicitly or explicitly):\n\n    \n    \n        (a) a learning paradigm: i.e., does the ANN require supervised training (i.e., being provided with indications of correct and incorrect performance), unsupervised training, or a hybrid of both (sometimes referred to as reinforcement);\n        (b) a collection of learning rules for indicating how to update the ANN;\n        (c) a learning algorithm for using the learning rules for adjusting the ANN weights.\n\nFurthermore, there are other implementation issues such as:\n\n        (d) how many layers a artificial neural net should have to effectively capture the patterns embedded within the training data. For example, the benefits of using small ANN are many, less costly to implement, faster, and tend to generalize better because they avoid over fitting weights to training patterns. That is, in general, more unknown parameters (weights) induce more local and global minima in the error surface or space. However, the error surface of smaller nets can be very rugged and have few good solutions, making it difficult for a local minimization algorithm to find a good solution from a random starting point as one skilled in the art will understand;\n        (e) how many units or neurons to provide per layer;\n        (f) how large should the training set be presented to provide effective generalization to non-training data\n        (g) what type of transfer functions should be used.",
        "However, the architecture of the present invention allows substantial flexibility in the implementation of ANN for FOMs 1224. In particular, there is no need to choose only one artificial neural net architecture and/or implementation in that a plurality of ANNs may be accommodated by the architecture of the location engine 139. Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind that it may not be necessary to train a ANN for a FOM as rigorously as is done in typical ANN applications since the accuracy and reliability in estimating the location of a target MS 140 with the present invention comes from synergistically utilizing a plurality of different MS location estimators, each of which may be undesirable in terms of accuracy and/or reliability in some areas, but when their estimates are synergistically used as in the location engine 139, accurate and reliable location estimates can be attained. Accordingly, one embodiment of the present invention may have a plurality of moderately well trained ANNs having different neural net architectures such as: multilayer perceptions, adaptive resonance theory models, and radial basis function networks.",
        "Additionally, many of the above mentioned ANN architecture and implementation decisions can be addressed substantially automatically by various commercial artificial neural net development systems such as: \u201cNEUROGENETIC OPTIMIZER\u201d by BioComp Systems, wherein genetic algorithms are used to optimize and configure ANNs, and artificial neural network hardware and software products by Accurate Automation Corporation of Chattanooga, Tenn., such as \u201cACCURATE AUTOMATION NEURAL NETWORK TOOLS.",
        "Artificial Neural Network Input and Output",
        "It is worthwhile to discuss the data representations for the inputs and outputs of a ANN used for generating MS location estimates. Regarding ANN input representations, recall that the signal processing subsystem 1220 may provide various RF signal measurements as input to an ANN (such as the RF signal measurements derived from verified location signatures in the location signature data base 1320). For example, a representation of a histogram of the frequency of occurrence of CDMA fingers in a time delay versus signal strength 2-dimensional domain may be provided as input to such an ANN. In particular, a 2-dimensional grid of signal strength versus time delay bins may be provided so that received signal measurements are slotted into an appropriate bin of the grid. In one embodiment, such a grid is a six by six array of bins such as illustrated in the left portion of FIG. 14. That is, each of the signal strength and time delay axes are partitioned into six ranges so that both the signal strength and the time delay of RF signal measurements can be slotted into an appropriate range, thus determining the bin.",
        "Note that RF signal measurement data (i.e., location signatures) slotted into a grid of bins provides a convenient mechanism for classifying RF measurements received over time so that when each new RF measurement data is assigned to its bin, a counter for the bin can be incremented. Thus in one embodiment, the RF measurements for each bin can be represented pictorially as a histogram. In any case, once the RF measurements have been slotted into a grid, various filters may be applied for filtering outliers and noise prior to inputting bin values to an ANN. Further, various amounts of data from such a grid may be provided to an ANN. In one embodiment, the tally from each bin is provided to an ANN. Thus, as many as 108 values could be input to the ANN (two values defining each bin, and a tally for the bin). However, other representations are also possible. For instance, by ordering the bin tallies linearly, only 36 need be provided as ANN input. Alternatively, only representations of bins having the highest tallies may be provided as ANN input. Thus, for example, if the highest 10 bins and their tallies were provided as ANN input, then only 20 inputs need be provided (i.e., 10 input pairs, each having a single bin identifier and a corresponding tally).",
        "In addition, note that the signal processing subsystem 1220 may also obtain the identifications of other base stations 122 (152) for which their pilot channels can be detected by the target MS 140 (i.e., the forward path), or for which the base stations can detect a signal from the target MS (i.e., the reverse path). Thus, in order to effectively utilize substantially all pertinent location RF signal measurements (i.e., from location signature data derived from communications between the target MS 140 and the base station infrastructure), a technique is provided wherein a plurality of ANNs may be activated using various portions of an ensemble of location signature data obtained. However, before describing this technique, it is worthwhile to note that a naive strategy of providing input to a single ANN for locating target MSs throughout an area having a large number of base stations (e.g., 300) is likely to be undesirable. That is, given that each base station (antenna sector) nearby the target MS is potentially able to provide the ANN with location signature data, the ANN would have to be extremely large and therefore may require inordinate training and retraining. For example, since there may be approximately 30 to 60 ANN inputs per location signature, an ANN for an area having even twenty base stations 122 can require at least 600 input neurons, and potentially as many as 1,420 (i.e., 20 base stations with 70 inputs per base station and one input for every one of possibly 20 additional surrounding base stations in the radio coverage area 120 that might be able to detect, or be detected by, a target MS 140 in the area corresponding to the ANN).",
        "Accordingly, the technique described herein limits the number of input neurons in each ANN constructed and generates a larger number of these smaller ANNs. That is, each ANN is trained on location signature data (or, more precisely, portions of location signature clusters) in an area AANN (hereinafter also denoted the \u201cnet area\u201d), wherein each input neuron receives a unique input from one of:\n\n    (A1) location signature data (e.g., signal strength/time delay bin tallies) corresponding to transmissions between an MS 140 and a relatively small number of base stations 122 in the area AANN For instance, location signature data obtained from, for example, a collection B of four base stations 122 (or antenna sectors) in the area AANN. Note, each location signature data cluster includes fields describing the wireless communication devices used; e.g., (i) the make and model of the target MS; (ii) the current and maximum transmission power; (iii) the MS battery power (instantaneous or current); (iv) the base station (sector) current power level; (v) the base station make and model and revision level; (vi) the air interface type and revision level (of, e.g., CDMA, TDMA or AMPS).\n    (A2) a discrete input corresponding to each base station 122 (or antenna sector 130) in a larger area containing AANN, wherein each such input here indicates whether the corresponding base station (sector):\n    \n        (i) is on-line (i.e., capable of wireless communication with MSs) and at least its pilot channel signal is detected by the target MS 140, but the base station (sector) does not detect the target MS;\n        (ii) is on-line and the base station (sector) detects a wireless transmission from the target MS, but the target MS does not detect the base station (sector) pilot channel signal;\n        (iii) is on-line and the base station (sector) detects the target MS and the base station (sector) is detected by the target MS;\n        (iv) is on-line and the base station (sector) does not detect the target MS, the base station is not detected by the target MS; or\n        (v) is off-line (i.e., incapable of wireless communication with one or more MSs).",
        "Note that (i)-(v) are hereinafter referred to as the \u201cdetection states.\u201d",
        "Thus, by generating an ANN for each of a plurality of net areas (potentially overlapping), a local environmental change in the wireless signal characteristics of one net area is unlikely to affect more than a small number of adjacent or overlapping net areas. Accordingly, such local environmental changes can be reflected in that only the ANNs having net areas affected by the local change need to be retrained. Additionally, note that in cases where RF measurements from a target MS 140 are received across multiple net areas, multiple ANNs may be activated, thus providing multiple MS location estimates. Further, multiple ANNs may be activated when a location signature cluster is received for a target MS 140 and location signature cluster includes location signature data corresponding to wireless transmissions between the MS and, e.g., more base stations (antenna sectors) than needed for the collection B described in the previous section. That is, if each collection B identifies four base stations 122 (antenna sectors), and a received location signature cluster includes location signature data corresponding to five base stations (antenna sectors), then there may be up to five ANNs activated to each generate a location estimate.",
        "Moreover, for each of the smaller ANNs, it is likely that the number of input neurons is on the order of 330; (i.e., 70 inputs per each of four location signatures (i.e., 35 inputs for the forward wireless communications and 35 for the reverse wireless communications), plus 40 additional discrete inputs for an appropriate area surrounding AANN, plus 10 inputs related to: the type of MS, power levels, etc.). However, it is important to note that the number of base stations (or antenna sectors 130) having corresponding location signature data to be provided to such an ANN may vary. Thus, in some subareas of the coverage area 120, location signature data from five or more base stations (antenna sectors) may be used, whereas in other subareas three (or less) may be used.",
        "Regarding the output from ANNs used in generating MS location estimates, there are also numerous options. In one embodiment, two values corresponding to the latitude and longitude of the target MS are estimated. Alternatively, by applying a mesh to the coverage area 120, such ANN output may be in the form of a row value and a column value of a particular mesh cell (and its corresponding area) where the target MS is estimated to be. Note that the cell sizes of the mesh need not be of a particular shape nor of uniform size. However, simple non-oblong shapes are desirable. Moreover, such cells should be sized so that each cell has an area approximately the size of the maximum degree of location precision desired. Thus, assuming square mesh cells, 250 to 350 feet per cell side in an urban/suburban area, and 500 to 700 feet per cell side in a rural area may be desirable.",

In one embodiment, the collection (is determined by interrogating the location signature data base 1320 for verified location signature clusters stored therein having such a common set B of base stations (antenna sectors). Alternatively in another embodiment, note that the collection C may be determined from (i) the existing engineering and planning data from service providers who are planning wireless cell sites, or (ii) service provider test data obtained using mobile test sets, access probes or other RF field measuring devices. Note that such a collection B of base stations (antenna sectors) should only be created when the set C of verified location signature clusters is of a sufficient size so that it is expected that the ANN can be effectively trained.\n    (b) Determine a collection of base stations (or antenna sectors 130), B\u2032, from the common set B, wherein B\u2032 is small (e.g., four or five).\n    (c) Determine the area, AANN, to be associated with collection B\u2032 of base stations (antenna sectors). In one embodiment, this area is selected by determining an area containing the set L of locations of all verified location signature clusters determined in step (a) having location signature data from each of the base stations (antenna sectors) in the collection B\u2032. More precisely, the area, AANN, may be determined by providing a covering of the locations of L, such as, e.g., by cells of a mesh of appropriately fine mesh size so that each cell is of a size not substantially larger than the maximum MS location accuracy desired.\n    (d) Determine an additional collection, b, of base stations that have been previously detected (and/or are likely to be detected) by at least one MS in the area AANN.\n    (e) Train the ANN on input data related to: (i) signal characteristic measurements of signal transmissions between MSs 140 at verified locations in AANN, and the base stations (antenna sectors) in the collection B\u2032, and (ii) discrete inputs of detection states from the base stations represented in the collection b. For example, train the ANN on input including: (i) data from verified location signatures from each of the base stations (antenna sectors) in the collection B\u2032, wherein each location signature is part of a cluster in the collection C; (ii) a collection of discrete values corresponding to other base stations (antenna sectors) in the area b containing the area, AANN.",
        "Regarding (d) immediately above, it is important to note that it is believed that less accuracy is required in training a ANN used for generating a location hypothesis (in a FOM 1224) for the present invention than in most applications of ANNs (or other trainable/adaptive components) since, in most circumstances, when signal measurements are provided for locating a target MS 140, the location engine 139 will activate a plurality location hypothesis generating modules (corresponding to one or more FOMs 1224) for substantially simultaneously generating a plurality of different location estimates (i.e., hypotheses). Thus, instead of training each ANN so that it is expected to be, e.g., 92% or higher in accuracy, it is believed that synergies with MS location estimates from other location hypothesis generating components will effectively compensate for any reduced accuracy in such a ANN (or any other location hypothesis generating component). Accordingly, it is believed that training time for such ANNs may be reduced without substantially impacting the MS locating performance of the location engine 139.",
        "Finding Near-Optimal Location Estimating Artificial Neural Networks",
        "In one traditional artificial neural network training process, a relatively tedious set of trial and error steps may be performed for configuring an ANN so that training produces effective learning. In particular, an ANN may require configuring parameters related to, for example, input data scaling, test/training set classification, detecting and removing unnecessary input variable selection. However, the present invention reduces this tedium. That is, the present invention uses mechanisms such as genetic algorithms or other mechanisms for avoiding non-optimal but locally appealing (i.e., local minimum) solutions, and locating near-optimal solutions instead. In particular, such mechanism may be used to adjust the matrix of weights for the ANNs so that very good, near optimal ANN configurations may be found efficiently. Furthermore, since the signal processing system 1220 uses various types of signal processing filters for filtering the RF measurements received from transmissions between an MS 140 and one or more base stations (antenna sectors 130), such mechanisms for finding near-optimal solutions may be applied to selecting appropriate filters as well. Accordingly, in one embodiment of the present invention, such filters are paired with particular ANNs so that the location signature data supplied to each ANN is filtered according to a corresponding \u201cfilter description\u201d for the ANN, wherein the filter description specifies the filters to be used on location signature data prior to inputting this data to the ANN. In particular, the filter description can define a pipeline of filters having a sequence of filters wherein for each two consecutive filters, f1 and f2 (f1 preceding f2), in a filter description, the output of f1 flows as input to f2. Accordingly, by encoding such a filter description together with its corresponding ANN so that the encoding can be provided to a near optimal solution finding mechanism such as a genetic algorithm, it is believed that enhanced ANN locating performance can be obtained. That is, the combined genetic codes of the filter description and the ANN are manipulated by the genetic algorithm in a search for a satisfactory solution (i.e., location error estimates within a desired range). This process and system provides a mechanism for optimizing not only the artificial neural network architecture, but also identifying a near optimal match between the ANN and one or more signal processing filters. Accordingly, the following filters may be used in a filter pipeline of a filter description: Sobel, median, mean, histogram normalization, input cropping, neighbor, Gaussian, Weiner filters.",

Furthermore, ANNs having complex inputs may be selected (as determined by a filter type in the signal processing subsystem 1220) for the genotypes.",
        "Examples of genetic parameters include: (a) maximum population size (typical default: 300), (b) generation limit (typical default: 50), (c) selection criteria, such as a certain percentage to survive (typical default: 0.5) or roulette wheel, (d) population refilling, such as random or cloning (default), (e) mating criteria, such as tail swapping (default) or two cut swapping, (f) rate for a choice of mutation criterion, such as random exchange (default: 0.25) or section reversal, (g) population size of the concatenated artificial neural network/filter combinations, (h) use of statistical seeding on the initial population to bias the random initialization toward stronger first order relating variables, and (i) neural node influence factors, e.g., input nodes and hidden nodes.

        "Locating a Mobile Station Using Artificial Neural Networks",
        "When using an artificial neural network for estimating a location of an MS 140, it is important that the artificial neural network be provided with as much accurate RF signal measurement data regarding signal transmissions between the target MS 140 and the base station infrastructure as possible. In particular, assuming ANN inputs as described hereinabove, it is desirable to obtain the detection states of as many surrounding base stations as possible. Thus, whenever the location engine 139 is requested to locate a target MS 140 (and in particular in an emergency context such as an emergency 911 call), the location center 140 automatically transmits a request to the wireless infrastructure to which the target MS is assigned for instructing the MS to raise its transmission power to full power for a short period of time (e.g., 100 milliseconds in a base station infrastructure configuration an optimized for such requests to 2 seconds in a non-optimized configuration). Note that the request for a change in the transmission power level of the target MS has a further advantage for location requests such as emergency 911 that are initiated from the MS itself in that a first ensemble of RF signal measurements can be provided to the location engine 139 at the initial 911 calling power level and then a second ensemble of RF signal measurements can be provided at a second higher transmission power level. Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention, an artificial neural network can be trained not only on the location signature cluster derived from either the initial wireless 911 transmissions or the full power transmissions, but also on the differences between these two transmissions. In particular, the difference in the detection states of the discrete ANN inputs between the two transmission power levels may provide useful additional information for more accurately estimating a location of a target MS.",
        "It is important to note that when gathering RF signal measurements from a wireless base station network for locating MSs, the network should not be overburdened with location related traffic. Accordingly, note that network location data requests for data particularly useful for ANN based FOMs is generally confined to the requests to the base stations in the immediate area of a target MS 140 whose location is desired. For instance, both collections of base stations B\u2032 and b discussed in the context of training an ANN are also the same collections of base stations from which MS location data would be requested. Thus, the wireless network MS location data requests are data driven in that the base stations to queried for location data (i.e., the collections B\u2032 and b) are determined by previous RF signal measurement characteristics recorded. Accordingly, the selection of the collections B\u2032 and b are adaptable to changes in the wireless environmental characteristics of the coverage area 120.",

        "Before proceeding with a description of other levels of the present invention as described in (24.1) through (24.3) above, in this section further detail is provided regarding the location signature data base 1320. Note that a brief description of the location signature data base was provided above indicating that this data base stores MS location data from verified and/or known locations (optionally with additional known environmental characteristic values) for use in enhancing current target MS location hypotheses and for comparing archived location data with location signal data obtained from a current target MS. However, the data base management system functionality incorporated into the location signature data base 1320 is an important aspect of the present invention, and is therefore described in this section. In particular, the data base management functionality described herein addresses a number of difficulties encountered in maintaining a large archive of signal processing data such as MS signal location data Some of these difficulties can be described as follows:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) in many signal processing contexts, in order to effectively utilize archived signal processing data for enhancing the performance of a related signal processing application, there must be an large amount of signal related data in the archive, and this data must be adequately maintained so that as archived signal data becomes less useful to the corresponding signal processing application (i.e., the data becomes \u201cinapplicable\u201d) its impact on the application should be correspondingly reduced. Moreover, as archive data becomes substantially inapplicable, it should be filtered from the archive altogether. However, the size of the data in the archive makes it prohibitive for such a process to be performed manually, and there may be no simple or straightforward techniques for automating such impact reduction or filtering processes for inapplicable signal data;\n        (b) it is sometimes difficult to determine the archived data to use in comparing with newly obtained signal processing application data; and\n        (c) it is sometimes difficult to determine a useful technique for comparing archived data with newly obtained signal processing application data.",
        "It is an aspect of the present invention that the data base management functionality of the location signature data base 1320 addresses each of the difficulties mentioned immediately above. For example, regarding (a), the location signature data base is \u201cself cleaning\u201d in that by associating a confidence value with each loc sig in the data base and by reducing or increasing the confidences of archived verified loc sigs according to how well their signal characteristic data compares with newly received verified location signature data, the location signature data base 1320 maintains a consistency with newly verified loc sigs.",
        "The following data base management functional descriptions describe some of the more noteworthy functions of the location signature data base 1320.

        "Update_Loc_Sig_DB(new_loc_obj, selection_criteria, loc_sig_pop)\n    \n        /* This program updates loc sigs in the location signature data base 1320. That is, this program updates, for example, at least the location information for verified random loc sigs residing in this data base. The general strategy here is to use information (i.e., \u201cnew_loc_obj\u201d) received from a newly verified location (that may not yet be entered into the location signature data base) to assist in determining if the previously stored random verified loc sigs are still reasonably valid to use for:\n        \n            (29.1) estimating a location for a given collection (i.e., \u201cbag\u201d) of wireless (e.g., CDMA) location related signal characteristics received from an MS,\n            (29.2) training (for example) adaptive location estimators (and location hypothesizing models), and\n            (29.3) comparing with wireless signal characteristics used in generating an MS location hypothesis by one of the MS location hypothesizing models (denoted First Order Models, or, FOMs).\n        \n        \n        More precisely, since it is assumed that it is more likely that the newest location information obtained is more indicative of the wireless (CDMA) signal characteristics within some area surrounding a newly verified location than the verified loc sigs (location signatures) previously entered into the Location Signature data base, such verified loc sigs are compared for signal characteristic consistency with the newly verified location information (object) input here for determining whether some of these \u201colder\u201d data base verified loc sigs still appropriately characterize their associated location.\n        \n            In particular, comparisons are iteratively made here between each (target) loc sig \u201cnear\u201d \u201cnew_loc_obj\u201d and a population of loc sigs in the location signature data base 1320 (such population typically including the loc sig for \u201cnew_loc_obj) for:\n            (29.4) adjusting a confidence factor of the target loc sig. Note that each such confidence factor is in the range [0, 1] with 0 being the lowest and 1 being the highest. Further note that a confidence factor here can be raised as well as lowered depending on how well the target loc sig matches or is consistent with the population of loc sigs to which it is compared. Thus, the confidence in any particular verified loc sig, LS, can fluctuate with successive invocations of this program if the input to the successive invocations are with location information geographically \u201cnear\u201d LS.\n            (29.5) remove older verified loc sigs from use whose confidence value is below a predetermined threshold. Note, it is intended that such predetermined thresholds be substantially automatically adjustable by periodically testing various confidence factor thresholds in a specified geographic area to determine how well the eligible data base loc sigs (for different thresholds) perform in agreeing with a number of verified loc sigs in a \u201cloc sig test-bed\u201d, wherein the test bed may be composed of, for example, repeatable loc sigs and recent random verified loc sigs.\n            \u2003Note that this program may be invoked with a (verified/known) random and/or repeatable loc sig as input. Furthermore, the target loc sigs to be updated may be selected from a particular group of loc sigs such as the random loc sigs or the repeatable loc sigs, such selection being determined according to the input parameter, \u201cselection_criteria\u201d while the comparison population may be designated with the input parameter, \u201cloc_sig_pop\u201d. For example, to update confidence factors of certain random loc sigs near \u201cnew_loc_obj\u201d, \u201cselection_criteria\u201d may be given a value indicating, \u201cUSE_RANDOM_LOC_SIGS\u201d, and \u201cloc_sig_pop\u201d may be given a value indicating, \u201cUSE_REPEATABLE_LOC_SIGS\u201d. Thus, if in a given geographic area, the repeatable loc sigs (from, e.g., stationary transceivers) in the area have recently been updated, then by successively providing \u201cnew_loc_obj\u201d with a loc sig for each of these repeatable loc sigs, the stored random loc sigs can have their confidences adjusted.\n            \u2003Alternatively, in one embodiment of the present invention, the present function may be used for determining when it is desirable to update repeatable loc sigs in a particular area (instead of automatically and periodically updating such repeatable loc sigs). For example, by adjusting the confidence factors on repeatable loc sigs here provides a method for determining when repeatable loc sigs for a given area should be updated. That is, for example, when the area's average confidence factor for the repeatable loc sigs drops below a given (potentially high) threshold, then the MSs that provide the repeatable loc sigs can be requested to respond with new loc sigs for updating the data base. Note, however, that the approach presented in this function assumes that the repeatable location information in the location signature data base 1320 is maintained with high confidence by, for example, frequent data base updating.

        "Context Adjuster Embodiments",
        "The context adjuster 1326 performs the first set of potentially many adjustments to at least the confidences of location hypotheses, and some important embodiments, both the confidences and the target MS location estimates provided by FOMs 1224 may be adjusted according to previous performances of the FOMs. More particularly, as mentioned above, the context adjuster adjusts confidences so that, assuming there is a sufficient density verified location signature clusters captured in the location signature data base 1320, the resulting location hypotheses output by the context adjuster 1326 may be further processed uniformly and substantially without concern as to differences in accuracy between the first order models from which location hypotheses originate. Accordingly, the context adjuster adjusts location hypotheses both to environmental factors (e.g., terrain, traffic, time of day, etc., as described in 30.1 above), and to how predictable or consistent each first order model (FOM) has been at locating previous target MS's whose locations were subsequently verified.",
        "Of particular importance is the novel computational paradigm utilized herein. That is, if there is a sufficient density of previous verified MS location data stored in the location signature data base 1320, then the FOM location hypotheses are used as an \u201cindex\u201d into this data base (i.e., the location signature data base) for constructing new target MS 140 location estimates. A more detailed discussion of this aspect of the present invention is given hereinbelow. Accordingly, only a brief overview is provided here. Thus, since the location signature data base 1320 stores previously captured MS location data including:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) clusters of MS location signature signals (see the location signature data base section for a discussion of these signals) and\n        (b) a corresponding verified MS location, for each such cluster, from where the MS signals originated, the context adjuster 1326 uses newly created target MS location hypotheses output by the FOM's as indexes or pointers into the location signature data base for identifying other geographical areas where the target MS 140 is likely to be located based on the verified MS location data in the location signature data base.",
        "In particular, at least the following two criteria are addressed by the context adjuster 1326:\n\n    \n    \n        (32.1) Confidence values for location hypotheses are to be comparable regardless of first order models from which the location hypotheses originate. That is, the context adjuster moderates or dampens confidence value assignment distinctions or variations between first order models so that the higher the confidence of a location hypothesis, the more likely (or unlikely, if the location hypothesis indicates an area estimate where the target MS is NOT) the target MS is perceived to be in the estimated area of the location hypothesis regardless of the First Order Model from which the location hypothesis was output;\n        (32.2) Confidence values for location hypotheses may be adjusted to account for current environmental characteristics such as month, day (weekday or weekend), time of day, area type (urban, rural, etc.), traffic and/or weather when comparing how accurate the first order models have previously been in determining an MS location according to such environmental characteristics. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, such environmental characteristics are accounted for by utilizing a transmission area type scheme (as discussed in section 5.9 above) when adjusting confidence values of location hypotheses. Details regarding the use of area types for adjusting the confidences of location hypotheses and provided hereinbelow, and in particular, in APPENDIX D.",
        "Note that in satisfying the above two criteria, the context adjuster 1326, at least in one embodiment, may use heuristic (fuzzy logic) rules to adjust the confidence values of location hypotheses from the first order models. Additionally, the context adjuster may also satisfy the following criteria:\n\n    \n    \n        (33.1) The context adjuster may adjust location hypothesis confidences due to BS failure(s),\n        (33.2) Additionally in one embodiment, the context adjuster may have a calibration mode for at least one of:\n        \n            (a) calibrating the confidence values assigned by first order models to their location hypotheses outputs;\n            (b) calibrating itself.",

A second embodiment is also described in Appendix D so as to not overburden the reader and thereby chance losing perspective of the overall invention.",
        "A description of the high level functions in an embodiment of the context adjuster 1326 follows. Details regarding the implementation of these functions are provided in APPENDIX D. Also, many of the terms used hereinbelow are defined in APPENDIX D. Accordingly, the program descriptions in this section provide the reader with an overview of this first embodiment of the context adjuster 1326.\n\n    Context_adjuster(loc_hyp_list)",

        "Thus, the mapped cluster density becomes an important factor in determining a confidence value for an estimated area of a target MS such as, for example, the area represented by \u201cimage_area\u201d. However, the mapped cluster density value requires modification before it can be utilized in the confidence calculation. In particular, confidence values must be in the range [\u22121, 1] and a mapped cluster density does not have this constraint. Thus, a \u201crelativized mapped cluster density\u201d for an estimated MS area is desired, wherein this relativized measurement is in the range [\u22121, +1], and in particular, for positive confidences in the range [0, 1]. Accordingly, to alleviate this difficulty, for the FOM define the term \u201cprediction mapped cluster density\u201d as a mapped cluster density value, MCD, for the FOM and image cluster set area wherein:\n\n    \n    \n        (i) MCD is sufficiently high so that it correlates (at least at a predetermined likelihood threshold level) with the actual target MS location being in the \u201cimage cluster set area\u201d when a FOM target MS location estimate is in the corresponding \u201ccluster set area\u201d;",
        "That is, for a cluster set area (e.g., \u201cloc_hyp.pt_covering\u201d) for the present FOM, if the image cluster set area: has a mapped cluster density greater than the \u201cprediction mapped cluster density\u201d, then there is a high likelihood of the target MS being in the image cluster set area.",
        "It is believed that the prediction mapped cluster density will typically be dependent on one or more area types. In particular, it is assumed that for each area type, there is a likely range of prediction mapped cluster density values that is substantially uniform across the area type. Accordingly, as discussed in detail hereinbelow, to calculate a prediction mapped cluster density for a particular area type, an estimate is made of the correlation between the mapped cluster densities of image areas (from cluster set areas) and the likelihood that if a verified MS location: (a) has a corresponding FOM MS estimate in the cluster set, and (b) is also in the particular area type, then the verified MS location is also in the image area.",
        "Thus, if an area is within a single area type, then such a \u201crelativized mapped cluster density\u201d measurement for the area may be obtained by dividing the mapped cluster density by the prediction mapped cluster density and taking the smaller of: the resulting ratio and 1.0 as the value for the relativized mapped cluster density.",
        "In some (perhaps most) cases, however, an area (e.g., an image cluster set area) may have portions in a number of area types. Accordingly, a \u201ccomposite prediction mapped cluster density\u201d may be computed, wherein, a weighted sum is computed of the prediction mapped cluster densities for the portions of the area that is in each of the area types. That is, the weighting, for each of the single area type prediction mapped cluster densities, is the fraction of the total area that this area type is. Thus, a \u201crelativized composite mapped cluster density\u201d for the area here may also be computed by dividing the mapped cluster density by the composite prediction mapped cluster density and taking the smaller of: the resulting ratio and 1.0 as the value for the relativized composite mapped cluster density.",

        "The following is a brief description of each submodule included in the location hypothesis analyzer 1332.\n\n    (35.1) A control module 1400 for managing or controlling further processing of location hypotheses received from the context adjuster. This module controls all location hypothesis processing within the location hypothesis analyzer as well as providing the input interface with the context adjuster. There are numerous embodiments that may be utilized for this module, including, but not limited to, expert systems and blackboard managers.\n    (35.2) A run-time location hypothesis storage area 1410 for retaining location hypotheses during their processing by the location hypotheses analyzer. This can be, for example, an expert system fact base or a blackboard. Note that in some of the discussion hereinbelow, for simplicity, this module is referred to as a \u201cblackboard\u201d. However, it is not intended that such notation be a limitation on the present invention; i.e., the term \u201cblackboard\u201d hereinafter will denote a run-time data repository for a data processing paradigm wherein the flow of control is substantially data-driven.\n    (35.3) An analytical reasoner module 1416 for determining if (or how well) location hypotheses are consistent with well known physical or heuristic constraints as, e.g., mentioned in (30.4) above. Note that this module may be a daemon or expert system rule base.\n    (35.4) An historical location reasoner module 1424 for adjusting location hypotheses' confidences according to how well the location signature characteristics (i.e., loc sigs) associated with a location hypothesis compare with \u201cnearby\u201d loc sigs in the location signature data base as indicated in (30.3) above. Note that this module may also be a daemon or expert system rule base.\n    (35.5) A location extrapolator module 1432 for use in updating previous location estimates for a target MS when a more recent location hypothesis is provided to the location hypothesis analyzer 1332. That is, assume that the control module 1400 receives a new location hypothesis for a target MS for which there are also one or more previous location hypotheses that either have been recently processed (i.e., they reside in the MS status repository 1338, as shown best in FIG. 6), or are currently being processed (i.e., they reside in the run-time location hypothesis storage area 1410). Accordingly, if the active_timestamp (see FIGS. 9A and 9B regarding location hypothesis data fields) of the newly received location hypothesis is sufficiently more recent than the active_timestamp of one of these previous location hypotheses, then an extrapolation may be performed by the location extrapolator module 1432 on such previous location hypotheses so that all target MS location hypotheses being concurrently analyzed are presumed to include target MS location estimates for substantially the same point in time. Thus, initial location estimates generated by the FOMs using different wireless signal measurements, from different signal transmission time intervals, may have their corresponding dependent location hypotheses utilized simultaneously for determining a most likely target MS location estimate. Note that this module may also be daemon or expert system rule base.\n    (35.6) hypothesis generating module 1428 for generating additional location hypotheses according to, for example, MS location information not adequately utilized or modeled. Note, location hypotheses may also be decomposed here if, for example it is determined that a location hypothesis includes an MS area estimate that has subareas with radically different characteristics such as an MS area estimate that includes an uninhabited area and a densely populated area. Additionally, the hypothesis generating module 1428 may generate \u201cpoor reception\u201d location hypotheses that specify MS location areas of known poor reception that are \u201cnear\u201d or intersect currently active location hypotheses. Note, that these poor reception location hypotheses may be specially tagged (e.g., with a distinctive FOM_ID value or specific tag field) so that regardless of substantially any other location hypothesis confidence value overlapping such a poor reception area, such an area will maintain a confidence value of \u201cunknown\u201d (i.e., zero). Note that substantially the only exception to this constraint is location hypotheses generated from mobile base stations 148. Note that this module may also be daemon or expert system rule base.",
        "In the blackboard system embodiment of the location hypothesis analyzer, a blackboard system is the mechanism by which the last adjustments are performed on location hypotheses and by which additional location hypotheses may be generated. Briefly, a blackboard system can be described as a particular class of software that typically includes at least three basic components. That is:\n\n    \n    \n        (36.1) a data base called the \u201cblackboard,\u201d whose stored information is commonly available to a collection of programming elements known as \u201cdaemons\u201d, wherein, in the present invention, the blackboard includes information concerning the current status of the location hypotheses being evaluated to determine a \u201cmost likely\u201d MS location estimate. Note that this data base is provided by the run time location hypothesis storage area 1410;\n        (36.2) one or more active (and typically opportunistic) knowledge sources, denoted conventionally as \u201cdaemons,\u201d that create and modify the contents of the blackboard. The blackboard system employed requires only that the daemons have application knowledge specific to the MS location problem addressed by the present invention. As shown in FIG. 7, the knowledge sources or daemons in the hypothesis analyzer include the analytical reasoner module 1416, the hypothesis generating module 1428, and the historical location reasoner module 1416;\n        (36.3) a control module that enables the realization of the behavior in a serial computing environment. The control element orchestrates the flow of control between the various daemons. This control module is provided by the control module 1400.",

Thus, the control module 1400 for the present embodiment is also used for orchestrating, coordinating and controlling the activity of the individual rule bases of the location hypothesis analyzer (e.g. as shown in FIG. 7, the analytical reasoner module 1416, the hypothesis generating module 1428, the historical location reasoner module 1424, and the location extrapolator module 1432).

        "The MS status repository 1338 is a run-time storage manager for storing location hypotheses from previous activations of the location engine 139 (as well as the output target MS location estimate(s)) so that a target MS may be tracked using target MS location hypotheses from previous location engine 139 activations to determine, for example, a movement of the target MS between evaluations of the target MS location. Thus, by retaining a moving window of previous location hypotheses used in evaluating positions of a target MS, measurements of the target MS's velocity, acceleration, and likely next position may be determined by the location hypothesis analyzer 1332. Further, by providing accessibility to recent MS location hypotheses, these hypotheses may be used to resolve conflicts between hypotheses in a current activation for locating the target MS; e.g., MS paths may be stored here for use in extrapolating a new location",

That is, the most likelihood estimator 1344 determines the area(s) within each such region having high confidences (or confidences above a threshold) as the most likely target MS 140 location estimates.",
        "In one embodiment of the most likelihood estimator 1344, this module utilizes an area mesh, M, over which to integrate, wherein the mesh cells of M are preferably smaller than the greatest location accuracy desired. That is, each cell, c, of M is assigned a confidence value indicating a likelihood that the target MS 140 is located in c, wherein the confidence value for c is determined by the confidence values of the target MS location estimates provided to the most likelihood estimator 1344. Thus, to obtain the most likely location determination(s) the following steps are performed:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) For each of the active location hypotheses output by, e.g., the hypothesis analyzer 1332 (alternatively, the context adjuster 1326), each corresponding MS location area estimate, LAE, is provided with a smallest covering, CLEA, of cells c from M.\n        (b) Subsequently, each of the cells of CLEA have their confidence values adjusted by adding to it the confidence value for LAE. Accordingly, if the confidence of LEA is positive, then the cells of CLEA have their confidences increased. Alternatively, if the confidence of LEA is negative, then the cells of CLEA have their confidences decreased.\n        (c) Given that the interval [\u22121.0, +1.0] represents the range in confidence values, and that this range has been partitioned into intervals, Int, having lengths of, e.g., 0.05, for each interval, Int, perform a cluster analysis function for clustering cells with confidences that are in Int. Thus, a topographical-type map may be constructed from the resulting cell clusters, wherein higher confidence areas are analogous to representations of areas having higher elevations.\n        (d) Output a representation of the resulting clusters for each Int to the output gateway 1356 for determining the location granularity and representation desired by each location application 146 requesting the location of the target MS 140.",
        "Of course, variations in the above algorithm also within the scope of the present invention. For example, some embodiments of the most likelihood estimator 1344 may:\n\n    \n    \n        (e) Perform special processing for areas designated as \u201cpoor reception\u201d areas. For example, the most likelihood estimator 1344 may be able to impose a confidence value of zero (i.e., meaning it is unknown as to whether the target MS is in the area) on each such poor reception area regardless of the location estimate confidence values unless there is a location hypothesis from a reliable and unanticipated source. That is, the mesh cells of a poor reception area may have their confidences set to zero unless, e.g., there is a location hypothesis derived from target MS location data provided by a mobile base station 148 that: (a) is near the poor reception area, (b) able to detect that the target MS 140 is in the poor reception area, and (c) can relay target MS location data to the location center 142. In such a case, the confidence of the target MS location estimate from the MBS location hypothesis may take precedence.\n        (f) Additionally, in some embodiments of the most likelihood estimator 1344, cells c of M that are \u201cnear\u201d or adjacent to a covering CLEA may also have their confidences adjusted according to how near the cells c are to the covering. That is, the assigning of confidences to cell meshes may be \u201cfuzzified\u201d in the terms of fuzzy logic so that the confidence value of each location hypothesis utilized by the most likelihood estimator 1344 is provided with a weighting factor depending on its proxity to the target MS location estimate of the location hypothesis. More precisely, it is believed that \u201cnearness,\u201d in the present context, should be monotonic with the \u201cwideness\u201d of the covering; i.e., as the extent of the covering increases (decreases) in a particular direction, the cells c affected beyond the covering also increases (decreases). Furthermore, in some embodiments of the most likelihood estimator 1344, the greater (lesser) the confidence in the LEA, the more (fewer) cells c beyond the covering have their confidences affected. To describe this technique in further detail, reference is made to FIG. 10, wherein an area A is assumed to be a covering CLEA having a confidence denoted \u201cconf\u201d. Accordingly, to determine a confidence adjustment to add to a cell c not in A (and additionally, the centroid of A not being substantially identical with the centroid of c which could occur if A were donut shaped), the following steps may be performed:\n        \n            (i) Determine the centroid of A, denoted Cent(A).\n            (ii) Determine the centroid of the cell c, denoted Q.\n            (iii) Determine the extent of A along the line between Cent(A) and Q, denoted L\n            (iv) For a given type of probability density function, P(x), such as a Gaussian function, let T be the beginning portion of the function that lives on the x-axis interval [0, t], wherein P(t)=ABS(conf)=the absolute value of the confidence of CLEA.\n            (v) Stretch T along the x-axis so that the stretched function, denoted sT(x), has an x-axis support of [0, L/(1+e[a(ABS(conf)\u22121)])], where a is in range of 3.0 to 10.0; e.g., 5.0. Note that sT(x) is the function,\n            \n                P(x*(1+e\u2212[a(ABS(conf)\u22121)])/L), on this stretched extent Further note that for confidences of +1 and \u22121, the support of sT(x) is [0, L] and for confidences at (or near) zero this support. Further, the term,\n\nL/(1+e\u2212[a(ABS(conf)\u22121)])\n\n                is monotonically increasing with L and ABS(conf).\n            \n            \n            (vi) Determine D=the minimum distance that Q is outside of A along the line between Cent(A) and Q.\n            (vii) Determine the absolute value of the change in the confidence of c as sT(D).\n            (viii) Provide the value sT(D) with the same sign as conf, and provide the potentially sign changed value sT(D) as the confidence of the cell c.",
        "Additionally, in some embodiments, the most likelihood estimator 1344, upon receiving one or more location hypotheses from the hypothesis analyzer 1332, also performs some or all of the following tasks:\n\n    \n    \n        (37.1) Filters out location hypotheses having confidence values near zero whenever such location hypotheses are deemed too unreliable to be utilized in determining a target MS location estimate. For example, location hypotheses having confidence values in the range [\u22120.02, 0.02] may be filtered here;\n        (37.2) Determines the area of interest over which to perform the integration. In one embodiment, this area is a convex hull including each of the MS area estimates from the received location hypotheses (wherein such location hypotheses have not been removed from consideration by the filtering process of (37.1));\n        (37.3) Determines, once the integration is performed, one or more collections of contiguous area mesh cells that may be deemed a \u201cmost likely\u201d MS location estimate, wherein each such collection includes one or more area mesh cells having a high confidence value.\n\nDetailed Description of the Location Hypothesis Analyzer Submodules\n\nAnalytical Reasoner Module",
        "The analytical reasoner applies constraint or \u201csanity\u201d checks to the target MS estimates of the location hypotheses residing in the Run-time Location Hypothesis Storage Area for adjusting the associated confidence values accordingly. In one embodiment, these sanity checks involve \u201cpath\u201d information. That is, this module determines if (or how well) location hypotheses are consistent with well known physical constraints such as the laws of physics, in an area in which the MS (associated with the location hypothesis) is estimated to be located. For example, if the difference between a previous (most likely) location estimate of a target MS and an estimate by a current location hypothesis requires the MS to:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) move at an unreasonably high rate of speed (e.g., 200 mph), or\n        (b) move at an unreasonably high rate of speed for an area (e.g., 80 mph in a corn patch), or\n        (c) make unreasonably sharp velocity changes (e.g., from 60 mph in one direction to 60 mph in the opposite direction in 4 sec then the confidence in the current hypothesis is reduced. Such path information may be derived for each time series of location hypotheses resulting from the FOMs by maintaining a window of previous location hypotheses in the MS status repository 1338. Moreover, by additionally retaining the \u201cmost likely\u201d target MS location estimates (output by the most likelihood estimator 1344), current location hypotheses may be compared against such most likely MS location estimates.",
        "The following path sanity checks are incorporated into the computations of this module. That is:\n\n    \n    \n        (1) do the predicted MS paths generally follow a known transportation pathway (e.g., in the case of a calculated speed of greater than 50 miles per hour are the target MS location estimates within, for example, 0.2 miles of a pathway where such speed may be sustained); if so (not), then increase (decrease) the confidence of the location hypotheses not satisfying this criterion;\n        (2) are the speeds, velocities and accelerations, determined from the current and past target MS location estimates, reasonable for the region (e.g., speeds should be less than 60 miles per hour in a dense urban area at 9 am); if so (not), then increase (decrease) the confidence of those that are (un)reasonable;\n        (3) are the locations, speeds, velocities and/or accelerations similar between target MS tracks produced by different FOMs similar; decrease the confidence of the currently active location hypotheses that are indicated as \u201coutliers\u201d by this criterion;\n        (4) are the currently active location hypothesis target MS estimates consistent with previous predictions of where the target MS is predicted to be from a previous (most likely) target MS estimate; if not, then decrease the confidence of at least those location hypothesis estimates that are substantially different from the corresponding predictions. Note, however, that in some cases this may be over ruled. For example, if the prediction is for an area for which there is Location Base Station coverage, and no Location Base Station covering the area subsequently reports communicating with the target MS, then the predictions are incorrect and any current location hypothesis from the same FOM should not be decreased here if it is outside of this Location Base Station coverage area",
        "Notice from FIG. 7 that the analytical reasoner can access location hypotheses currently posted on the Run-time Location Hypothesis Storage Area. Additionally, it interacts with the Pathway Database which contains information concerning the location of natural transportation pathways in the region (highways, rivers, etc.) and the Area Characteristics Database which contains information concerning, for example, reasonable velocities that can be expected in various regions (for instance, speeds of 80 mph would not be reasonably expected in dense urban areas). Note that both speed and direction can be important constraints; e.g., even though a speed might be appropriate for an area, such as 20 mph in a dense urban area, if the direction indicated by a time series of related location hypotheses is directly through an extensive building complex having no through traffic routes, then a reduction in the confidence of one or more of the location hypotheses may be appropriate.",
        "One embodiment of the Analytical Reasoner illustrating how such constraints may be implemented is provided in the following section. Note, however, that this embodiment analyzes only location hypotheses having a non-negative confidence value.",
        "Modules of an embodiment of the analytical reasoner module 1416 are provided hereinbelow.",
        "Path Comparison Module",
        "The path comparison module 1454 implements the following strategy: the confidence of a particular location hypothesis is be increased (decreased) if it is (not) predicting a path that lies along a known transportation pathway (and the speed of the target MS is sufficiently high). For instance, if a time series of target MS location hypotheses for a given FOM is predicting a path of the target MS that lies along an interstate highway, the confidence of the currently active location hypothesis for this FOM should, in general, be increased. Thus, at a high level the following steps may be performed:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) For each FOM having a currently active location hypothesis in the Run-time Location Hypothesis Storage Area (also denoted \u201cblackboard\u201d), determine a recent \u201cpath\u201d obtained from a time series of location hypotheses for the FOM. This computation for the \u201cpath\u201d is performed by stringing together successive \u201ccenter of area\u201d (COA) or centroid values determined from the most pertinent target MS location estimate in each location hypothesis (recall that each location hypothesis may have a plurality of target MS area estimates with one being the most pertinent). The information is stored in, for example, a matrix of values wherein one dimension of the matrix identifies the FOM and the a second dimension of the matrix represents a series of COA path values. Of course, some entries in the matrix may be undefined.\n        (b) Compare each path obtained in (a) against known transportation pathways in an area containing the path. A value, path_match(i), representing to what extent the path matches any known transportation pathway is computed. Such values are used later in a computation for adjusting the confidence of each corresponding currently active location hypothesis.\n\nVelocity/Acceleration Calculation Module",
        "The velocity/acceleration calculation module 1458 computes velocity and/or acceleration estimates for the target MS 140 using currently active location hypotheses and previous location hypothesis estimates of the target MS. In one embodiment, for each FOM 1224 having a currently active location hypothesis (with positive confidences) and a sufficient number of previous (reasonably recent) target MS location hypotheses, a velocity and/or acceleration may be calculated. In an alternative embodiment, such a velocity and/or acceleration may be calculated using the currently active location hypotheses and one or more recent \u201cmost likely\u201d locations of the target MS output by the location engine 139. If the estimated velocity and/or acceleration corresponding to a currently active location hypothesis is reasonable for the region, then its confidence value may be incremented; if not, then its confidence may be decremented. The algorithm may be summarized as follows:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) Approximate speed and/or acceleration estimates for currently active target MS location hypotheses may be provided using path information related to the currently active location hypotheses and previous target MS location estimates in a manner similar to the description of the path comparison module 1454. Accordingly, a single confidence adjustment value may be determined for each currently active location hypothesis for indicating the extent to which its corresponding velocity and/or acceleration calculations are reasonable for its particular target MS location estimate. This calculation is performed by retrieving information from the area characteristics data base 1450 (e.g., FIGS. 6 and 7). Since each location hypothesis includes timestamp data indicating when the MS location signals were received from the target MS, the velocity and/or acceleration associated with a path for a currently active location hypothesis can be straightforwardly approximated. Accordingly, a confidence adjustment value, vel_ok(i), indicating a likelihood that the velocity calculated for the ith currently active location hypothesis (having adequate corresponding path information) may be appropriate is calculated using for the environmental characteristics of the location hypothesis' target MS location estimate. For example, the area characteristics data base 1450 may include expected maximum velocities and/or accelerations for each area type and/or cell of a cell mesh of the coverage area 120. Thus, velocities and/or accelerations above such maximum values may be indicative of anomalies in the MS location estimating process. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the most recent location hypotheses yielding such extreme velocities and/or accelerations may have their confidence values decreased. For example, if the target MS location estimate includes a portion of an interstate highway, then an appropriate velocity might correspond to a speed of up to 100 miles per hour, whereas if the target MS location estimate includes only rural dirt roads and tomato patches, then a likely speed might be no more than 30 miles per hour with an maximum speed of 60 miles per hour (assuming favorable environmental characteristics such as weather). Note that a list of such environmental characteristics may include such factors as: area type, time of day, season. Further note that more unpredictable environmental characteristics such as traffic flow patterns, weather (e.g., clear, raining, snowing, etc.) may also be included, values for these latter characteristics coming from the environmental data base 1354 which receives and maintains information on such unpredictable characteristics (e.g., FIGS. 6 and 7). Also note that a similar confidence adjustment value, acc_ok(i), may be provided for currently active location hypotheses, wherein the confidence adjustment is related to the appropriateness of the acceleration estimate of the target MS.\n\nAttribute Comparison Module",
        "The attribute comparison module 1462 compares attribute values for location hypotheses generated from different FOMs, and determines if the confidence of certain of the currently active location hypotheses should be increased due to a similarity in related values for the attribute. That is, for an attribute A, an attribute value for A derived from a set SFOM[1] of one or more location hypotheses generated by one FOM, FOM[1], is compared with another attribute value for A derived from a set SFOM2 of one or more location hypotheses generated by a different FOM, FOM[2] for determining if these attribute values cluster (i.e., are sufficiently close to one another) so that a currently active location hypothesis in SFOM[1] and a currently active location hypothesis in SFOM[2] should have their confidences increased. For example, the attribute may be \u201ctarget MS path data\u201d attribute, wherein a value for the attribute is an estimated target MS path derived from location hypotheses generated by a fixed FOM over some (recent) time period. Alternatively, the attribute might be, for example, one of a velocity and/or acceleration, wherein a value for the attribute is a velocity and/or acceleration derived from location hypotheses generated by a fixed FOM over some (recent) time period.",
        "In a general context, the attribute comparison module 1462 operates according to the following premise:\n\n    (38.1) for each of two or more currently active location hypotheses (with, e.g., positive confidences) if:\n    \n        (a) each of these currently active location hypotheses, H, was initially generated by a corresponding different FOMH;\n        (b) for a given MS estimate attribute and each such currently active location hypothesis, H, there is a corresponding value for the attribute (e.g., the attribute value might be an MS path estimate, or alternatively an MS estimated velocity, or an MS estimated acceleration), wherein the attribute value is derived without using a FOM different from FOMH, and;\n        (c) the derived attribute values cluster sufficiently well,\n\nthen each of these currently active location hypotheses, H, will have their corresponding confidences increased. That is, these confidences will be increased by a confidence adjustment value or delta",
        "Note that the phrase \u201ccluster sufficiently well\u201d above may have a number of technical embodiments, including performing various cluster analysis techniques wherein any clusters (according to some statistic) must satisfy a system set threshold for the members of the cluster being close enough to one another. Further, upon determining the (any) location hypotheses satisfying (38.1), there are various techniques that may be used in determining a change or delta in confidences to be applied. For example, in one embodiment, an initial default confidence delta that may be utilized is: if \u201ccf\u201d denotes the confidence of such a currently active location hypothesis satisfying (38.1), then an increased confidence that still remains in the interval [0,1.0] may be: cf+[(1\u2212cf)/(1+cf)]2,or, cf*[1.0+cfn], n.=>2, or, cf*[a constant having a system tuned parameter as a factor]. That is, the confidence deltas for these examples are: [(1\u2212cf)/(1+cf)]2 (an additive delta), and, [1.0+cfn] (a multiplicative delta), and a constant. Additionally, note that it is within the scope of the present invention to also provide such confidence deltas (additive deltas or multiplicative deltas) with factors related to the number of such location hypotheses in the cluster.",
        "Moreover, note that it is an aspect of the present invention to provide an adaptive mechanism (i.e., the adaptation engine 1382 shown in FIGS. 5, 6 and 8) for automatically determining performance enhancing changes in confidence adjustment values such as the confidence deltas for the present module. That is, such changes are determined by applying an adaptive mechanism, such as a genetic algorithm, to a collection of \u201csystem parameters\u201d (including parameters specifying confidence adjustment values as well as system parameters of, for example, the context adjuster 1326) in order to enhance performance of the present invention. More particularly, such an adaptive mechanism may repeatedly perform the following steps:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) modify such system parameters;\n        (b) consequently activate an instantiation of the location engine 139 (having the modified system parameters) to process, as input, a series of MS signal location data that has been archived together with data corresponding to a verified MS location from which signal location data was transmitted (e.g., such data as is stored in the location signature data base 1320); and\n        (c) then determine if the modifications to the system parameters enhanced location engine 139 performance in comparison to previous performances.",
        "Assuming this module adjusts confidences of currently active location hypotheses according to one or more of the attributes: target MS path data, target MS velocity, and target MS acceleration, the computation for this module may be summarized in the following steps:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) Determine if any of the currently active location hypotheses satisfy the premise (38.1) for the attribute. Note that in making this determination, average distances and average standard deviations for the paths (velocities and/or accelerations) corresponding to currently active location hypotheses may be computed.\n        (b) For each currently active location hypothesis (wherein \u201ci\u201d uniquely identifies the location hypothesis) selected to have its confidence increased, a confidence adjustment value, path_similar(i) (alternatively, velocity_similar(i) and/or acceleration_similar(i) ), is computed indicating the extent to which the attribute value matches another attribute value being predicted by another FOM.",
        "Note that such confidence adjustment values are used later in the calculation of an aggregate confidence adjustment to particular currently active location hypotheses.",
        "Analytical Reasoner Controller",
        "Given one or more currently active location hypotheses for the same target MS input to the analytical reasoner controller 1466, this controller activates, for each such input location hypothesis, the other submodules of the analytical reasoner module 1416 (denoted hereinafter as \u201cadjustment submodules\u201d) with this location hypothesis. Subsequently, the analytical reasoner controller 1466 receives an output confidence adjustment value computed by each adjustment submodule for adjusting the confidence of this location hypothesis. Note that each adjustment submodule determines:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) whether the adjustment submodule may appropriately compute a confidence adjustment value for the location hypothesis supplied by the controller. (For example, in some cases there may not be a sufficient number of location hypotheses in a time series from a fixed FOM);\n        (b) if appropriate, then the adjustment submodule computes a non-zero confidence adjustment value that is returned to the analytical reasoner controller.",

Note that interpolation routines (e.g., conventional algorithms such as Lagrange or Newton polynomials) may be used to determine an equation that approximates a target MS path corresponding to a currently active location hypothesis.",
        "Subsequently, such an extrapolation equation may be used to compute a future target MS location. For further information regarding such interpolation schemes, the following reference is incorporated herein by reference: Mathews, 1992, Numerical methods for mathematics, science, and engineering. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall.",
        "Accordingly, if a new currently active location hypothesis (e.g., supplied by the context adjuster) is received by the blackboard, then the target MS location estimate of the new location hypothesis may be compared with the predicted location. Consequently, a confidence adjustment value can be determined according to how well the new location hypothesis \u201ci\u201d fits with the predicted location. That is, this confidence adjustment value will be larger as the new MS estimate and the predicted estimate become closer together.",
        "Note that in one embodiment of the present invention, such predictions are based solely on previous target MS location estimates output by location engine 139. Thus, in such an embodiment, substantially every currently active location hypothesis can be provided with a confidence adjustment value by this module once a sufficient number of previous target MS location estimates have been output. Accordingly, a value, extrapolation_chk(i), that represents how accurately the new currently active location hypothesis (identified here by \u201ci\u201d) matches the predicted location is determined.",
        "Hypothesis Generating Module",
        "The hypothesis generating module 1428 is used for generating additional location hypotheses according to, for example, MS location information not adequately utilized or modeled. Note, location hypotheses may also be decomposed here if, for example it is determined that a location hypothesis includes an MS area estimate that has subareas with radically different characteristics such as an area that includes an uninhabited area and a densely populated area. Additionally, the hypothesis generating module 1428 may generate \u201cpoor reception\u201d location hypotheses that specify MS location areas of known poor reception that are \u201cnear\u201d or intersect currently active location hypotheses. Note, that these poor reception location hypotheses may be specially tagged (e.g., with a distinctive FOM_ID value or specific tag field) so that regardless of substantially any other location hypothesis confidence value overlapping such a poor reception area, such an area will maintain a confidence value of \u201cunknown\u201d (i.e., zero). Note that substantially the only exception to this constraint is location hypotheses generated from mobile base stations 148.",
        "Mobile Base Station Location Subsystem Description",
        "Mobile Base Station Subsystem Introduction",
        "Any collection of mobile electronics (denoted mobile location unit) that is able to both estimate a location of a target MS 140 and communicate with the base station network may be utilized by the present invention to more accurately locate the target MS. Such mobile location units may provide greater target MS location accuracy by, for example, homing in on the target MS and by transmitting additional MS location information to the location center 142. There are a number of embodiments for such a mobile location unit contemplated by the present invention. For example, in a minimal version, such the electronics of the mobile location unit may be little more than an onboard MS 140, a sectored/directional antenna and a controller for communicating between them. Thus, the onboard MS is used to communicate with the location center 142 and possibly the target MS 140, while the antenna monitors signals for homing in on the target MS 140. In an enhanced version of the mobile location unit, a GPS receiver may also be incorporated so that the location of the mobile location unit may be determined and consequently an estimate of the location of the target MS may also be determined. However, such a mobile location unit is unlikely to be able to determine substantially more than a direction of the target MS 140 via the sectored/directional antenna without further base station infrastructure cooperation in, for example, determining the transmission power level of the target MS or varying this power level. Thus, if the target MS or the mobile location unit leaves the coverage area 120 or resides in a poor communication area, it may be difficult to accurately determine where the target MS is located. None-the-less, such mobile location units may be sufficient for many situations, and in fact the present invention contemplates their use. However, in cases where direct communication with the target MS is desired without constant contact with the base station infrastructure, the present invention includes a mobile location unit that is also a scaled down version of a base station 122. Thus, given that such a mobile base station or MBS 148 includes at least an onboard MS 140, a sectored/directional antenna, a GPS receiver, a scaled down base station 122 and sufficient components (including a controller) for integrating the capabilities of these devices, an enhanced autonomous MS mobile location system can be provided that can be effectively used in, for example, emergency vehicles, airplanes and boats. Accordingly, the description that follows below describes an embodiment of an MBS 148 having the above mentioned components and capabilities for use in a vehicle.",
        "As a consequence of the MBS 148 being mobile, there are fundamental differences in the operation of an MBS in comparison to other types of BS's 122 (152). In particular, other types of base stations have fixed locations that are precisely determined and known by the location center, whereas a location of an MBS 148 may be known only approximately and thus may require repeated and frequent re-estimating. Secondly, other types of base stations have substantially fixed and stable communication with the location center (via possibly other BS's in the case of LBSs 152) and therefore although these BS's may be more reliable in their in their ability to communicate information related to the location of a target MS with the location center, accuracy can be problematic in poor reception areas. Thus, MBS's may be used in areas (such as wilderness areas) where there may be no other means for reliably and cost effectively locating a target MS 140 (i.e., there may be insufficient fixed location BS's coverage in an area).",
        "FIG. 11 provides a high level block diagram architecture of one embodiment of the MBS location subsystem 1508., Accordingly, an MBS may include components for communicating with the fixed location BS network infrastructure and the location center 142 via an on-board transceiver 1512 that is effectively an MS 140 integrated into the location subsystem 1508. Thus, if the MBS 148 travels through an area having poor infrastructure signal coverage, then the MBS may not be able to communicate reliably with the location center 142 (e.g., in rural or mountainous areas having reduced wireless telephony coverage). So it is desirable that the MBS 148 must be capable of functioning substantially autonomously from the location center. In one embodiment, this implies that each MBS 148 must be capable of estimating both its own location as well as the location of a target MS 140.",
        "Additionally, many commercial wireless telephony technologies require all BS's in a network to be very accurately time synchronized both for transmitting MS voice communication as well as for other services such as MS location. Accordingly, the MBS 148 will also require such time synchronization. However, since an MBS 148 may not be in constant communication with the fixed location BS network (and indeed may be off-line for substantial periods of time), on-board highly accurate timing device may be necessary. In one embodiment, such a device may be a commercially available ribidium oscillator 1520 as shown in FIG. 11.",
        "Since the MBS 148 , includes a scaled down version of a BS 122 (denoted 1522 in FIG. 11), it is capable of performing most typical BS 122 tasks, albeit on a reduced scale. In particular, the base station portion of the MBS 148 can:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) raise/lower its pilot channel signal strength,\n        (b) be in a state of soft hand-off with an MS 140, and/or\n        (c) be the primary BS 122 for an MS 140, and consequently be in voice communication with the target MS (via the MBS operator telephony interface 1524) if the MS supports voice communication.",
        "Further, the MBS 148 can, if it becomes the primary base station communicating with the MS 140, request the MS to raise/lower its power or, more generally, control the communication with the MS (via the base station components 1522). However, since the MBS 148 will likely have substantially reduced telephony traffic capacity in comparison to a standard infrastructure base station 122, note that the pilot channel for the MBS is preferably a nonstandard pilot channel in that it should not be identified as a conventional telephony traffic bearing BS 122 by MS's seeking normal telephony communication. Thus, a target MS 140 requesting to be located may, depending on its capabilities, either automatically configure itself to scan for certain predetermined MBS pilot channels, or be instructed via the fixed location base station network (equivalently BS infrastructure) to scan for a certain predetermined MBS pilot channel.",
        "Moreover, the MBS 148 has an additional advantage in that it can substantially increase the reliability of communication with a target MS 140 in comparison to the base station infrastructure by being able to move toward or track the target MS 140 even if this MS is in (or moves into) a reduced infrastructure base station network coverage area. Furthermore, an MBS 148 may preferably use a directional or smart antenna 1526 to more accurately locate a direction of signals from a target MS 140. Thus, the sweeping of such a smart antenna 1526 (physically or electronically) provides directional information regarding signals received from the target MS 140. That is, such directional information is determined by the signal propagation delay of signals from the target MS 140 to the angular sectors of one of more directional antennas 1526 on-board the MBS 148.",
        "Before proceeding to further details of the MBS location subsystem 1508, an example of the operation of an MBS 148 in the context of responding to a 911 emergency call is given. In particular, this example describes the high level computational states through which the MBS 148 transitions, these states also being illustrated in the state transition diagram of FIG. 12. Note that this figure illustrates the primary state transitions between these MBS 148 states, wherein the solid state transitions are indicative of a typical \u201cideal\u201d progression when locating or tracking a target MS 140, and the dashed state transitions are the primary state reversions due, for example, to difficulties in locating the target MS 140.",
        "Accordingly, initially the MBS 148 may be in an inactive state 1700, wherein the MBS location subsystem 1508 is effectively available for voice or data communication with the fixed location base station network, but the MS 140 locating capabilities of the MBS are not active. From the inactive state 1700 the MBS (e.g., a police or rescue vehicle) may enter an active state 1704 once an to MBS operator has logged onto the MBS location subsystem of the MBS, such logging being for authentication, verification and journaling of MBS 148 events. In the active state 1704, the MBS may be listed by a 911 emergency center and/or the location center 142 as eligible for service in responding to a 911 request. From this state, the MBS 148 may transition to a ready state 1708 signifying that the MBS is ready for use in locating and/or intercepting a target MS 140. That is, the MBS 148 may transition to the ready state 1708 by performing the following steps:\n\n    \n    \n        (1a) Synchronizing the timing of the location subsystem 1508 with that of the base station network infrastructure. In one embodiment, when requesting such time synchronization from the base station infrastructure, the MBS 148 will be at a predetermined or well known location so that the MBS time synchronization may adjust for a known amount of signal propagation delay in the synchronization signal.\n        (1b) Establishing the location of the MBS 148. In one embodiment, this may be accomplished by, for example, an MBS operator 20 identifying the predetermined or well known location at which the MBS 148 is located.\n        (1c) Communicating with, for example, the 911 emergency center via the fixed location base station infrastructure to identify the MBS 148 as in the ready state.",
        "Thus, while in the ready state 1708, as the MBS 148 moves, it has its location repeatedly (re)-estimated via, for example, GPS signals, location center 142 location estimates from the base stations 122 (and 152), and an on-board dead reckoning subsystem 1527 having an MBS location estimator according to the programs described hereinbelow. However, note that the accuracy of the base station time synchronization (via the ribidium oscillator 1520) and the accuracy of the MBS 148 location may need to both be periodically recalibrated according to (1a) and (1b) above.",
        "Assuming a 911 signal is transmitted by a target MS 140, this signal is transmitted, via the fixed location base station infrastructure, to the 911 emergency center and the location center 142, and assuming the MBS 148 is in the ready state 1708, if a corresponding 911 emergency request is transmitted to the MBS (via the base station infrastructure) from the 911 emergency center or the location center, then the MBS may transition to a seek state 1712 by performing the following steps:\n\n    \n    \n        (2a) Communicating with, for example, the 911 emergency response center via the fixed location base station network to receive the PN code for the target MS to be located (wherein this communication is performed using the MS-like transceiver 1512 and/or the MBS operator telephony interface 1524).\n        (2b) Obtaining a most recent target MS location estimate from either the 911 emergency center or the location center 142.\n        (2c) Inputting by the MBS operator an acknowledgment of the target MS to be located, and transmitting this acknowledgment to the 911 emergency response center via the transceiver 1512.",
        "Subsequently, when the MBS 148 is in the seek state 1712, the MBS may commence toward the target MS location estimate provided. Note that it is likely that the MBS is not initially in direct signal contact with the target MS. Accordingly, in the seek state 1712 the following steps may be, for example, performed:\n\n    \n    \n        (3a) The location center 142 or the 911 emergency response center may inform the target MS, via the fixed location base station network, to lower its threshold for soft hand-off and at least periodically boost its location signal strength. Additionally, the target MS may be informed to scan for the pilot channel of the MBS 148. (Note the actions here are not, actions performed by the MBS 148 in the \u201cseek state\u201d; however, these actions are given here for clarity and completeness.)\n        (3b) Repeatedly, as sufficient new MS location information is available, the location center 142 provides new MS location estimates to the MBS 148 via the fixed location base station network.\n        (3c) The MBS repeatedly provides the MBS operator with new target MS location estimates provided substantially by the location center via the fixed location base station network.\n        (3d) The MBS 148 repeatedly attempts to detect a signal from the target MS using the PN code for the target MS.\n        (3e) The MBS 148 repeatedly estimates its own location (as in other states as well), and receives MBS location estimates from the location center.",
        "Assuming that the MBS 148 and target MS 140 detect one another (which typically occurs when the two units are within 0.25 to 3 miles of one another), the MBS enters a contact state 1716 when the target MS 140 enters a soft hand-off state with the MBS. Accordingly, in the contact state 1716, the following steps are, for example, performed:\n\n    \n    \n        (4a) The MBS 148 repeatedly estimates its own location.\n        (4b) Repeatedly, the location center 142 provides new target MS 140 and MBS location estimates to the MBS 148 via the fixed location base infrastructure network.\n        (4c) Since the MBS 148 is at least in soft hand-off with the target MS 140, the MBS can estimate the direction and distance of the target MS itself using, for example, detected target MS signal strength and TOA as well as using any recent location center target MS location estimates.\n        (4d) The MBS 148 repeatedly provides the MBS operator with new target MS location estimates provided using MS location estimates provided by the MBS itself and by the location center via the fixed location base station network.",
        "When the target MS 140 detects that the MBS pilot channel is sufficiently strong, the target MS may switch to using the MBS 148 as its primary base station. When this occurs, the MBS enters a control state 1720, wherein the following steps are, for example, performed:\n\n    \n    \n        (5a) The MBS 148 repeatedly estimates its own location.\n        (5b) Repeatedly, the location center 142 provides new target MS and MBS location estimates to the MBS 148 via the network of base stations 122 (152).\n        (5c) The MBS 148 estimates the direction and distance of the target MS 140 itself using, for example, detected target MS signal strength and TOA as well as using any recent location center target MS location estimates.\n        (5d) The MBS 148 repeatedly provides the MBS operator with new target MS location estimates provided using MS location estimates provided by the MBS itself and by the location center 142 via the fixed location base station network.\n        (5e) The MBS 148 becomes the primary base station for the target MS 140 and therefore controls at least the signal strength output by the target MS.",
        "Note, there can be more than one MBS 148 tracking or locating an MS 140. There can also be more than one target MS 140 to be tracked concurrently and each target MS being tracked may be stationary or moving.",
        "MBS Subsystem Architecture",
        "An MBS 148 uses MS signal characteristic data for locating the MS 140. The MBS 148 may use such signal characteristic data to facilitate determining whether a given signal from the MS is a \u201cdirect shot\u201d or an multipath signal. That is, in one embodiment, the MBS 148 attempts to determine or detect whether an MS signal transmission is received directly, or whether the transmission has been reflected or deflected. For example, the MBS may determine whether the expected signal strength, and TOA agree in distance estimates for the MS signal transmissions. Note, other signal characteristics may also be used, if there are sufficient electronics and processing available to the MBS 148; i.e., determining signal phase and/or polarity as other indications of receiving a \u201cdirect shot\u201d from an MS 140.",
        "In one embodiment, the MBS 148 (FIG. 11) includes an MBS controller 1533 for controlling the location capabilities of the MBS 148. In particular, the MBS controller 1533 initiates and controls the MBS state changes as described in FIG. 12 above. Additionally, the MBS controller 1533 also communicates with the location controller 1535, wherein this latter controller controls MBS activities related to MBS location and target MS location; e.g., this performs the program, \u201cmobile_base_station_controller\u201d described in APPENDIX A hereinbelow. The location controller 1535 receives data input from an event generator 1537 for generating event records to be provided to the location controller 1535. For example, records may be generated from data input received from: (a) the vehicle movement detector 1539 indicating that the MBS 148 has moved at least a predetermined amount and/or has changed direction by at least a predetermined angle, or (b) the MBS signal processing subsystem 1541 indicating that the additional signal measurement data has been received from either the location center 142 or the target MS 140. Note that the MBS signal processing subsystem 1541, in one embodiment, is similar to the signal processing subsystem 1220 of the location center 142. Moreover, also note that there may be multiple command schedulers. In particular, a scheduler 1528 for commands related to communicating with the location center 142, a scheduler 1530 for commands related to GPS communication (via GPS receiver 1531), a scheduler 1529 for commands related to the frequency and granularity of the reporting of MBS changes in direction and/or position via the MBS dead reckoning subsystem 1527 (note that this scheduler is potentially optional and that such commands may be provided directly to the dead reckoning estimator 1544), and a scheduler 1532 for communicating with the target MS(s) 140 being located. Further, it is assumed that there is sufficient hardware and/or software to perform commands in different schedulers substantially concurrently.",
        "In order to display an MBS computed location of a target MS 140, a location of the MBS must be known or determined. Accordingly, each MBS 148 has a plurality of MBS location estimators (or hereinafter also simply referred to as location estimators) for determining the location of the MBS. Each such location estimator computes MBS location information such as MBS location estimates, changes to MBS location estimates, or, an MBS location estimator may be an interface for buffering and/or translating a previously computed MBS location estimate into an appropriate format. In particular, the MBS location module 1536, which determines the location of the MBS, may include the following MBS location estimators 1540 (also denoted baseline location estimators):\n\n    \n    \n        (a) a GPS location estimator 1540a (not individually shown) for computing an MBS location estimate using GPS signals,\n        (b) a location center location estimator 1540b (not individually shown) for buffering and/or translating an MBS estimate received from the location center 142,\n        (c) an MBS operator location estimator 1540c (not individually shown) for buffering and/or translating manual MBS location entries received from an MBS location operator, and\n        (d) in some MBS embodiments, an LBS location estimator 1540d (not individually shown) for the activating and deactivating of LBS's 152. Note that, in high multipath areas and/or stationary base station marginal coverage areas, such low cost location base stations 152 (LBS) may be provided whose locations are fixed and accurately predetermined and whose signals are substantially only receivable within a relatively small range (e.g., 2000 feet), the range potentially being variable. Thus, by communicating with the LBS's 152 directly, the MBS 148 may be able to quickly use the location information relating to the location base stations for determining its location by using signal characteristics obtained from the LBSs 152.",
        "Note that each of the MBS baseline location estimators 1540, such as those above, provide an actual MBS location rather than, for example, a change in an MBS location. Further note that it is an aspect of the present invention that additional MBS baseline location estimators 1540 may be easily integrated into the MBS location subsystem 1508 as such baseline location estimators become available. For example, a baseline location estimator that receives MBS location estimates from reflective codes provided, for example, on streets or street signs can be straightforwardly incorporated into the MBS location subsystem 1508.",
        "Additionally, note that a plurality of MBS location technologies and their corresponding MBS location estimators are utilized due to the fact that there is currently no single location technology available that is both sufficiently fast, accurate and accessible in substantially all terrains to meet the location needs of an MBS 148. For example, in many terrains GPS technologies may be sufficiently accurate; however, GPS technologies: (a) may require a relatively long time to provide an initial location estimate (e.g., greater than 2 minutes); (b) when GPS communication is disturbed, it may require an equally long time to provide a new location estimate; (c) clouds, buildings and/or mountains can prevent location estimates from being obtained; (d) in some cases signal reflections can substantially skew a location estimate. As another example, an MBS 148 may be able to use triangulation or trilateralization technologies to obtain a location estimate; however, this assumes that there is sufficient (fixed location) infrastructure BS coverage in the area the MBS is located. Further, it is well known that the multipath phenomenon can substantially distort such location estimates. Thus, for an MBS 148 to be highly effective in varied terrains, an MBS is provided with a plurality of location technologies, each supplying an MBS location estimate.",
        "In fact, much of the architecture of the location engine 139 could be incorporated into an MBS 148. For example, in some embodiments of the MBS 148, the following FOMs 1224 may have similar location models incorporated into the MBS:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) a variation of the distance FOM 1224 wherein TOA signals from communicating fixed location BS's are received (via the MBS transceiver 1512) by the MBS and used for providing a location estimate;\n        (b) a variation of the artificial neural net based FOMs 1224 (or more generally a location learning or a classification model) may be used to provide MBS location estimates via, for example, learned associations between fixed location BS signal characteristics and geographic locations;\n        (c) an LBS location FOM 1224 for providing an MBS with the ability to activate and deactivate LBS's to provide (positive) MBS location estimates as well as negative MBS location regions (i.e., regions where the MBS is unlikely to be since one or more LBS's are not detected by the MBS transceiver);\n        (d) one or more MBS location reasoning agents and/or a location estimate heuristic agents for resolving MBS location estimate conflicts and providing greater MBS location estimate accuracy. For example, modules similar to the analytical reasoner module 1416 and the historical location reasoner module 1424.",
        "However, for those MBS location models requiring communication with the base station infrastructure, an alternative embodiment is to rely on the location center 142 to perform the computations for at least some of these MBS FOM models. That is, since each of the MBS location models mentioned immediately above require communication with the network of fixed location BS's 122 (152), it may be advantageous to transmit MBS location estimating data to the location center 142 as if the MBS were another MS 140 for the location center to locate, and thereby rely on the location estimation capabilities at the location center rather than duplicate such models in the MBS 148. The advantages of this approach are that:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) an MBS is likely to be able to use less expensive processing power and software than that of the location center;\n        (b) an MBS is likely to require substantially less memory, particularly for data bases, than that of the location center.",
        "As will be discussed further below, in one embodiment of the MBS 148, there are confidence values assigned to the locations output by the various location estimators 1540. Thus, the confidence for a manual entry of location data by an MBS operator may be rated the highest and followed by the confidence for (any) GPS location data, followed by the confidence for (any) location center location 142 estimates, followed by the confidence for (any) location estimates using signal characteristic data from LBSs. However, such prioritization may vary depending on, for instance, the radio coverage area 120. In an one embodiment of the present invention, it is an aspect of the present invention that for MBS location data received from the GPS and location center, their confidences may vary according to the area in which the MBS 148 resides. That is, if it is known that for a given area, there is a reasonable probability that a GPS signal may suffer multipath distortions and that the location center has in the past provided reliable location estimates, then the confidences for these two location sources may be reversed.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, MBS operators may be requested to occasionally manually enter the location of the MBS 148 when the MBS is stationary for determining and/or calibrating the accuracy of various MBS location estimators.",
        "There is an additional important source of location information for the MBS 148 that is incorporated into an MBS vehicle (such as a police vehicle) that has no comparable functionality in the network of fixed location BS's. That is, the MBS 148 may use dead reckoning information provided by a dead reckoning MBS location estimator 1544 whereby the MBS may obtain MBS dead reckoning location change estimates. Accordingly, the dead reckoning MBS location estimator 1544 may use, for example, an on-board gyroscope 1550, a wheel rotation measurement device (e.g., odometer) 1554, and optionally an accelerometer (not shown). Thus, such a deadreckoning MBS location estimator 1544 periodically provides at least MBS distance and directional data related to MBS movements from a most recent MBS location estimate. More precisely, in the absence of any other new MBS location information, the deadreckoning MBS location estimator 1544 outputs a series of measurements, wherein each such measurement is an estimated change (or delta) in the position of the MBS 148 between a request input timestamp and a closest time prior to the timestamp, wherein a previous deadreckoning terminated. Thus, each deadreckoning location change estimate includes the following fields:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) an \u201cearliest timestamp\u201d field for designating the start time when the deadreckoning location change estimate commences measuring a change in the location of the MBS;\n        (b) a \u201clatest timestamp\u201d field for designating the end time when the deadreckoning location change estimate stops measuring a change in the location of the MBS; and\n        (c) an MBS location change vector.",
        "That is, the \u201clatest timestamp\u201d is the timestamp input with a request for deadreckoning location data, and the \u201cearliest timestamp\u201d is the timestamp of the closest time, T, prior to the latest timestamp, wherein a previous deadreckoning output has its a timestamp at a time equal to T.",
        "Further, the frequency of such measurements provided by the deadreckoning subsystem 1527 may be adaptively provided depending on the velocity of the MBS 148 and/or the elapsed time since the most recent MBS location update. Accordingly, the architecture of at least some embodiments of the MBS location subsystem 1508 must be such that it can utilize such deadreckoning information for estimating the location of the MBS 148.",
        "In one embodiment of the MBS location subsystem 1508 described in further detail hereinbelow, the outputs from the deadreckoning MBS location estimator 1544 are used to synchronize MBS location estimates from different MBS baseline location estimators. That is, since such a deadreckoning output may be requested for substantially any time from the deadreckoning MBS location estimator, such an output can be requested for substantially the same point in time as the occurrence of the signals from which a new MBS baseline location estimate is derived. Accordingly, such a deadreckoning output can be used to update other MBS location estimates not using the new MBS baseline location estimate.",
        "It is assumed that the error with deadreckoning increases with deadreckoning distance. Accordingly, it is an aspect of the embodiment of the MBS location subsystem 1508 that when incrementally updating the location of the MBS 148 using deadreckoning and applying deadreckoning location change estimates to a \u201cmost likely area\u201d in which the MBS 148 is believed to be, this area is incrementally enlarged as well as shifted. The enlargement of the area is used to account for the inaccuracy in the deadreckoning capability. Note, however, that the deadreckoning MBS location estimator is periodically reset so that the error accumulation in its outputs can be decreased. In particular, such resetting occurs when there is a high probability that the location of the MBS is known. For example, the deadreckoning MBS location estimator may be reset when an MBS operator manually enters an MBS location or verifies an MBS location, or a computed MBS location has sufficiently high confidence.",
        "Thus, due to the MBS 148 having less accurate location information (both about itself and a target MS 140), and further that deadreckoning information must be utilized in maintaining MBS location estimates, a first embodiment of the MBS location subsystem architecture is somewhat different from the location engine 139 architecture. That is, the architecture of this first embodiment is simpler than that of the architecture of the location engine 139. However, it important to note that, at a high level, the architecture of the location engine 139 may also be applied for providing a second embodiment of the MBS location subsystem 1508, as one skilled in the art will appreciate after reflecting on the architectures and processing provided at an MBS 148. For example, an MBS location subsystem 1508 architecture may be provided that has one or more first order models 1224 whose output is supplied to, for example, a blackboard or expert system for resolving MBS location estimate conflicts, such an architecture being analogous to one embodiment of the location engine 139 architecture.",
        "Furthermore, it is also an important aspect of the present invention that, at a high level, the MBS location subsystem architecture may also be applied as an alternative architecture for the location engine 139. For example, in one embodiment of the location engine 139, each of the first order models 1224 may provide its MS location hypothesis outputs to a corresponding \u201clocation track,\u201d analogous to the MBS location tracks described hereinbelow, and subsequently, a most likely MS current location estimate may be developed in a \u201ccurrent location track\u201d (also described hereinbelow) using the most recent location estimates in other location tracks.",
        "Further, note that the ideas and methods discussed here relating to MBS location estimators 1540 and MBS location tracks, and, the related programs hereinbelow are sufficiently general so that these ideas and methods may be applied in a number of contexts related to determining the location of a device capable of movement and wherein the location of the device must be maintained in real time. For example, the present ideas and methods may be used by a robot in a very cluttered environment (e.g., a warehouse), wherein the robot has access: (a) to a plurality of \u201crobot location estimators\u201d that may provide the robot with sporadic location information, and (b) to a deadreckoning location estimator.",
        "Each MBS 148, additionally, has a location display (denoted the MBS operator visual user interface 1558 in FIG. 11) where area maps that may be displayed together with location data. In particular, MS location data may be displayed on this display as a nested collection of areas, each smaller nested area being the most likely area within (any) encompassing area for locating a target MS 140. Note that the MBS controller algorithm below may be adapted to receive location center 142 data for displaying the locations of other MBSs 148 as well as target MSs 140.",
        "Further, the MBS 148 may constrain any location estimates to streets on a street map using the MBS location snap to street module 1562. For example, an estimated MBS location not on a street may be \u201csnapped to\u201d a nearest street location. Note that a nearest street location determiner may use \u201cnormal\u201d orientations of vehicles on streets as a constraint on the nearest street location, particularly, if an MBS 148 is moving at typical rates of speed and acceleration, and without abrupt changes in direction. For example, if the deadreckoning MBS location estimator 1544 indicates that the MBS 148 is moving in a northerly direction, then the street snapped to should be a north-south running street. Moreover, the MBS location snap to street module 1562 may also be used to enhance target MS location estimates when, for example, it is known or suspected that the target MS 140 is in a vehicle and the vehicle is moving at typical rates of speed. Furthermore, the snap to street location module 1562 may also be used in enhancing the location of a target MS 140 by either the MBS 148 or by the location engine 139. In particular, the location estimator 1344 or an additional module between the location estimator 1344 and the output gateway 1356 may utilize an embodiment of the snap to street location module 1562 to enhance the accuracy of target MS 140 location estimates that are known to be in vehicles. Note that this may be especially useful in locating stolen vehicles that have embedded wireless location transceivers (MSs 140), wherein appropriate wireless signal measurements can be provided to the location center 142.",
        "MBS Data Structure Remarks",
        "Assuming the existence of at least some of the location estimators 1540 that were mentioned above, the discussion here refers substantially to the data structures and their organization as illustrated in FIG. 13.",
        "The location estimates (or hypotheses) for an MBS 148 determining its own location each have an error or range estimate associated with the MBS location estimate. That is, each such MBS location estimate includes a \u201cmost likely MBS point location\u201d within a \u201cmost likely area\u201d. The \u201cmost likely MBS point location\u201d is assumed herein to be the centroid of the \u201cmost likely area.\u201d In one embodiment of the MBS location subsystem 1508, a nested series of \u201cmost likely areas\u201d may be provided about a most likely MBS point location. However, to simplify the discussion herein each MBS location estimate is assumed to have a single \u201cmost likely area\u201d. One skilled in the art will understand how to provide such nested \u201cmost likely areas\u201d from the description herein. Additionally, it is assumed that such \u201cmost likely areas\u201d are not grossly oblong; i.e., area cross sectioning lines through the centroid of the area do not have large differences in their lengths. For example, for any such \u201cmost likely area\u201d, A, no two such cross sectioning lines of A may have lengths that vary by more than a factor of two.",
        "Each MBS location estimate also has a confidence associated therewith providing a measurement of the perceived accuracy of the MBS being in the \u201cmost likely area\u201d of the location estimate.",
        "A (MBS) \u201clocation track\u201d is an data structure (or object) having a queue of a predetermined length for maintaining a temporal (timestamp) ordering of \u201clocation track entries\u201d such as the location track entries 1770a, 1770b, 1774a, 1774b, 1778a, 1778b, 1782a, 1782b, and 1786a (FIG. 13), wherein each such MBS location track entry is an estimate of the location of the MBS at a particular corresponding time.",
        "There is an MBS location track for storing MBS location entries obtained from MBS location estimation information from each of the MBS baseline location estimators described above (i.e., a GPS location track 1750 for storing MBS location estimations obtained from the GPS location estimator 1540, a location center location track 1754 for storing MBS location estimations obtained from the location estimator 1540 deriving its MBS location estimates from the location center 142, an LBS location track 1758 for storing MBS location estimations obtained from the location estimator 1540 deriving its MBS location estimates from base stations 122 and/or 152, and a manual location track 1762 for MBS operator entered MBS locations). Additionally, there is one further location track, denoted the \u201ccurrent location track\u201d 1766 whose location track entries may be derived from the entries in the other location tracks (described further hereinbelow). Further, for each location track, there is a location track head that is the head of the queue for the location track. The location track head is the most recent (and presumably the most accurate) MBS location estimate residing in the location track. Thus, the GPS location track 1750 has location track head 1770; the location center location track 1754 has location track head 1774; the LBS location track 1758 has location track head 1778; the manual location track 1762 has location track head 1782; and the current location track 1766 has location track head 1786. Additionally, for notational convenience, for each location track, the time series of previous MBS location estimations (i.e., location track entries) in the location track will herein be denoted the \u201cpath for the location track.\u201d Such paths are typically the length of the location track queue containing the path. Note that the length of each such queue may be determined using at least the following considerations:\n\n    \n    \n        (i) In certain circumstances (described hereinbelow), the location track entries are removed from the head of the location track queues so that location adjustments may be made. In such a case, it may be advantageous for the length of such queues to be greater than the number of entries that are expected to be removed;\n        (ii) In determining an MBS location estimate, it may be desirable in some embodiments to provide new location estimates based on paths associated with previous MBS location estimates provided in the corresponding location track queue.\n\nAlso note that it is within the scope of the present invention that the location track queue lengths may be a length of one.",
        "Regarding location track entries, each location track entry includes:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) a \u201cderived location estimate\u201d for the MBS that is derived using at least one of:\n        \n            (i) at least a most recent previous output from an MBS baseline location estimator 1540 (i.e., the output being an MBS location estimate);\n            (ii) deadreckoning output information from the deadreckoning subsystem 1527.\n        \n        \n        \u2003Further note that each output from an MBS location estimator has a \u201ctype\u201d field that is used for identifying the MBS location estimator of the output.\n        (b) an \u201cearliest timestamp\u201d providing the time/date when the earliest MBS location information upon which the derived location estimate for the MBS depends. Note this will typically be the timestamp of the earliest MBS location estimate (from an MBS baseline location estimator) that supplied MBS location information used in deriving the derived location estimate for the MBS 148.\n        (c) a \u201clatest timestamp\u201d providing the time/date when the latest MBS location information upon which the derived location estimate for the MBS depends. Note that earliest timestamp=latest timestamp only for so called \u201cbaseline entries\u201d as defined hereinbelow. Further note that this attribute is the one used for maintaining the \u201ctemporal (timestamp) ordering\u201d of location track entries.\n        (d) A \u201cdeadreckoning distance\u201d indicating the total distance (e.g., wheel turns or odometer difference) since the most recently previous baseline entry for the corresponding MBS location estimator for the location track to which the location track entry is assigned.",
        "For each MBS location track, there are two categories of MBS location track entries that may be inserted into a MBS location track:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) \u201cbaseline\u201d entries, wherein each such baseline entry includes (depending on the location track) a location estimate for the MBS 148 derived from: (i) a most recent previous output either from a corresponding MBS baseline location estimator, or (ii) from the baseline entries of other location tracks (this latter case being the for the \u201ccurrent\u201d location track);\n        (b) \u201cextrapolation\u201d entries, wherein each such entry includes an MBS location estimate that has been extrapolated from the (most recent) location track head for the location track (i.e., based on the track head whose \u201clatest timestamp\u201d immediately precedes the latest timestamp of the extrapolation entry). Each such extrapolation entry is computed by using data from a related deadreckoning location change estimate output from the deadreckoning MBS location estimator 1544. Each such deadreckoning location change estimate includes measurements related to changes or deltas in the location of the MBS 148. More precisely, for each location track, each extrapolation entry is determined using: (i) a baseline entry, and (ii) a set of one or more (i.e., all later occurring) deadreckoning location change estimates in increasing \u201clatest timestamp\u201d order. Note that for notational convenience this set of one or more deadreckoning location change estimates will be denoted the \u201cdeadreckoning location change estimate set\u201d associated with the extrapolation entry resulting from this set.\n        (c) Note that for each location track head, it is either a baseline entry or an extrapolation entry. Further, for each extrapolation entry, there is a most recent baseline entry, B, that is earlier than the extrapolation entry and it is this B from which the extrapolation entry was extrapolated. This earlier baseline entry, B, is hereinafter denoted the \u201cbaseline entry associated with the extrapolation entry.\u201d More generally, for each location track entry, T, there is a most recent previous baseline entry, B, associated with T, wherein if T is an extrapolation entry, then B is as defined above, else if T is a baseline entry itself, then T=B. Accordingly, note that for each extrapolation entry that is the head of a location track, there is a most recent baseline entry associated with the extrapolation entry.",
        "Further, there are two categories of location tracks:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) \u201cbaseline location tracks,\u201d each having baseline entries exclusively from a single predetermined MBS baseline location estimator; and\n        (b) a \u201ccurrent\u201d MBS location track having entries that are computed or determined as \u201cmost likely\u201d MBS location estimates from entries in the other MBS location tracks.\n\nMBS Location Estimating Strategy",
        "In order to be able to properly compare the track heads to determine the most likely MBS location estimate it is an aspect of the present invention that the track heads of all location tracks include MBS location estimates that are for substantially the same (latest) timestamp. However, the MBS location information from each MBS baseline location estimator is inherently substantially unpredictable and unsynchronized. In fact, the only MBS location information that may be considered predicable and controllable is the deadreckoning location change estimates from the deadreckoning MBS location estimator 1544 in that these estimates may reliably be obtained whenever there is a query from the location controller 1535 for the most recent estimate in the change of the location for the MBS 148. Consequently (referring to FIG. 13), synchronization records 1790 (having at least a 1790b portion, and in some cases also having a 1790a portion) may be provided for updating each location track with a new MBS location estimate as a new track head. In particular, each synchronization record includes a deadreckoning location change estimate to be used in updating all but at most one of the location track heads with a new MBS location estimate by using a deadreckoning location change estimate in conjunction with each MBS location estimate from an MBS baseline location estimator, the location track heads may be synchronized according to timestamp. More precisely, for each MBS location estimate, E, from an MBS baseline location estimator, the present invention also substantially simultaneously queries the deadreckoning MBS location estimator for a corresponding most recent change in the location of the MBS 148. Accordingly, E and the retrieved MBS deadreckoning location change estimate, C, have substantial the same \u201clatest timestamp\u201d. Thus, the location estimate E may be used to create a new baseline track head for the location track having the corresponding type for E, and C may be used to create a corresponding extrapolation entry as the head of each of the other location tracks. Accordingly, since for each MBS location estimate, E, there is a MBS deadreckoning location change estimate, C, having substantially the same \u201clatest timestamp\u201d, E and C will be hereinafter referred as \u201cpaired.\u201d",
