        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a semiconductor device using a semiconductor film having a crystalline structure, and to a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device. More specifically, the present invention relates to a semiconductor device having a thin film transistor (TFT) containing an active layer having a channel forming region, a source region, and a drain region from a semiconductor film having a crystalline structure, and a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Liquid crystal display devices have widened the marketplace with their advantages of low electric power consumption and space conservation, and have finally reached the point of substituting for CRTs as televisions used daily in households. As such, bright display at high definition equal to or better than that of CRTs, and a price comparable to that of CRTs, are sought for liquid crystal display devices.",
        "Demanded of TFTs formed in pixel portions of liquid crystal display devices in general use as displays (display devices) is mainly a low off current (electric current flowing when the TFTs are in an off operation state). Even a slight leak of the off current in an off operation state of the TFT invites a reduction in contrast and in image quality. There has been a problem with TFTs containing active layers having a crystalline structure, which are recently used more and more due to their high field effect mobility, in that the off current becomes large.",
        "An LDD (lightly doped drain) structure is known as a technique of suppressing the off current. In Japanese patent #3072655 (structure shown in FIG. 2A), a structure is disclosed in which a first transistor and a second transistor are connected in series, sandwiching a low concentration impurity region (double gate structure having a low concentration impurity region sandwiched by channel forming regions).",
        "The demand for making liquid crystal display devices have higher definition is met by increasing the number of pixels, and the demand for higher brightness is met by increasing the aperture ratio. Screen size is determined by standards, and therefore it is necessary to increase the number of pixels within a limited pixel surface area. This means that the pixel size must be shrunk, and that a technique for further increasing the aperture ratio must be achieved while reducing the pixel size. There are limitations on making the wiring width narrower for increase of the aperture ratio, considering problems such as a rise of the wiring resistance. Thus, making the size of switching TFTs within the pixels smaller can be considered.",
        "Further, the size of storage capacitors can be made smaller provided that the off current of the switching TFTs of the pixels can be made smaller. Therefore, it is very important to make TFTs having a low off current in order to additionally increase the aperture ratio.",
        "However, the characteristics required by the circuits used on the same substrate are different. It is necessary to make TFTs having different structures depending upon which circuit they are used for. TFTs are manufactured by lamination while performing steps for etching semiconductor films, insulating films, and conductive films into predetermined shapes using photomasks. Therefore, if the TFT structure is optimized according to the requirements of the pixel portion or each driver circuit, then the number of photomasks simply increases, the manufacturing processes become complex, and the number of process steps inevitably increases. Further, TFTs having a sufficiently low off current cannot be manufactured even if small TFTs are manufactured in order to increase the aperture ratio in the pixel portion, and the reliability drops. It is not easy to manufacture the desired display device (semiconductor device).",
        "With the aim of solving these problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a TFT having a low off current at a small pixel size (small TFT size), and to provide a technique for achieving optimal TFT structures for the driving conditions of a pixel portion and driver circuits by using a small number of photomasks.",
        "Further, an object of the present invention is to provide a technique of making different TFTs, having a low off current and having TFT structures optimal for the driving conditions of a pixel portion and driver circuits, without increasing the number of manufacturing processes or the production costs.",

        "FIG. 10 is a circuit block diagram showing an example of the circuit structure of an active matrix substrate. A pixel portion 601 formed from built-in TFTs, a date signal line driver circuit 602, and a scanning signal line driver circuit 606 are formed.",
        "The data signal line driver circuit 602 is structured from a shift register 603, latches 604 and 605, and in addition, buffer circuits and the like. Clock signals and start signals are input to the shift register 603, and digital data signals and latch signals are input to the latches. Further, the scanning signal line driver circuit 606 also is structured from shift registers, buffer circuits, and the like. There may be an arbitrary number of pixels in the pixel portion 601, and 1024\u00d7768 pixels are formed for XGA.",
        "A display device having active matrix drive can be formed by using the active matrix substrate. The pixel electrodes are formed by a material having light reflecting properties in Embodiment 1, and therefore a reflection type display device can be formed if this substrate is applied to a liquid crystal display device. A liquid crystal display device or a light emitting device in which the pixel portion is constituted of organic light emitting elements can be formed from this type of substrate. An active matrix substrate corresponding to a reflection type display device can therefore be manufactured.",
        "Another embodiment of a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device is explained in Embodiment 2 using FIGS. 6A to 6C. Note that processes identical to those of Embodiment 1 are used up through the first etching process shown in FIG. 4A. The state of a substrate on which elements are being formed, up through completion of the first etching process of FIG. 4A, is shown in FIG. 6A.",
        "The state of FIG. 6A has the substrate 100, the base insulating film 101 (the base insulating film 101a made of a silicon oxynitride film and the base insulating film 101b made of a silicon oxynitride film), the first through the fourth semiconductor layers 103 to 106, the gate insulating film 107, and the first shape gate electrodes 114 to 117.",
        "A first doping process is performed here. An n-type impurity element is added to the first through the fourth semiconductor layers 103 to 106, forming n-type impurity regions 301 to 304 containing the first concentration of the n-type impurity element, at a low concentration of 1\u00d71015 to 1\u00d71017/cm3.",
        "A second etching process is performed next. The first shape gate electrodes 114 to 117 (composed of the first electrodes 114a to 117a and the second electrodes 114b to 117b) are etched, forming second shape gate electrodes 305 to 308 (composed of electrodes (A) 305a to 308a and electrodes (B) 305b to 308b).",
        "After completing the process steps up through this point, manufacturing proceeds similarly to Embodiment 1 from the second doping process shown by FIG. 4C, and the active matrix substrate like that shown in FIG. 5C can be manufactured.",
        "An embodiment of a method of manufacturing a semiconductor film used in an active layer in Embodiment 1 or Embodiment 2 is explained using FIGS. 7A to 7E. In this method, a metallic element having a catalytic action is added to the entire surface of a semiconductor film having an amorphous structure, crystallization is performed, and then gettering is performed.",
        "A high field effect mobility can be obtained by using the semiconductor film having good crystallinity obtained by the method disclosed in Embodiment 3 as an active layer, and a TFT having high reliability can be manufactured.",
        "There are no particular limitations placed on the material of a substrate 701 in FIG. 7A, but preferably a material such as barium borosilicate glass, aluminum borosilicate glass, or quartz can be used. A first silicon oxynitride film 702 manufactured by plasma CVD from SiH4, NH3, and N2O with a thickness of 50 nm, and a second silicon oxynitride film 703 manufactured from SiH4 and N2O with a thickness of 100 mm, are formed on the surface of the substrate 701 as base insulating films. The base insulating films are formed so that alkaline metals contained in the glass substrate do not diffuse within semiconductor films formed on the substrate, and it is possible to omit the base insulating films if quartz is used for the substrate.",
        "A semiconductor material having silicon as its main constituent is used for a semiconductor film 704 having an amorphous structure formed on the base insulating film. A film such as an amorphous silicon film or an amorphous silicon germanium film is typically applied, and formed having a thickness of 10 to 100 nm by plasma CVD, reduced pressure CVD, or sputtering. The concentration of impurities such as oxygen and nitrogen contained in the amorphous semiconductor film 704 may be reduced to a level equal to, or less than, 5\u00d71018/cm3 in order to obtain good crystals. These impurities become primary factors hindering crystallization of the amorphous semiconductor, and further, cause the density of capture centers and recrystallization centers to increase. It is therefore preferable to use very high purity material gasses, and also to use a CVD apparatus corresponding to an extremely high vacuum, in which the inside of the reaction chamber has undergone mirror surface processing (field polishing processing), and which is prepared with an oil free vacuum evacuation system.",
        "A metallic element that has a catalytic action for promoting crystallization is then added to the surface of the amorphous semiconductor film 704. One element, or a plurality of elements, selected from the group consisting of iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), osmium (Os), iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt), copper (Cu), gold (Au) and the like can be used as the metallic element that has a catalytic action for promoting crystallization of the semiconductor film. Nickel is typically used, and a catalyst containing layer 705 is formed by applying a nickel acetate salt solution, containing from 1 to 100 ppm nickel by weight, using a spinner. In this case, an extremely thin oxidized film may be formed from an ozone containing aqueous solution as a surface preparation of the amorphous structure semiconductor film 704 in order to increase the wetting of the liquid. A clean surface is formed after etching the oxide film using a mixed solution of hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen peroxide, and an extremely thin oxide film is formed once again by processing with an ozone containing aqueous solution. The surface of semiconductor films such as silicon is initially hydrophobic, and therefore a uniform application of the nickel acetate salt solution can be achieved by forming the oxide film.",
        "The catalyst containing layer 705 is of course not limited to this type of method, and may also be formed using sputtering, evaporation, plasma processing, and the like. Furthermore, the catalyst containing layer 705 may also be formed before forming the amorphous structure semiconductor film 704, that is the catalyst containing layer 705 may be formed on the base insulating film.",
        "Heat treatment is performed for crystallization while maintaining the state in which the amorphous structure semiconductor film 704 and the catalytic element containing layer 705 are in contact. A furnace annealing method using an electric oven, or a rapid thermal annealing (hereafter referred to as RTA) method using a heat source such as a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp, a xenon arc lamp, a carbon arc lamp, a high pressure sodium lamp, or a high pressure mercury lamp is employed as the heat treatment method. Considering productivity, RTA can be thought of a preferable method to be employed.",
        "A heat treatment lamp light source is turned on for 1 to 60 seconds, preferably for 30 to 60 seconds, and this is repeated between 1 and 10 times, preferably between 2 and 6 times, when performing the RTA method. The intensity of light emitted from the lamp light source may be arbitrarily set, but it is preferable to set the intensity such that the semiconductor film is instantaneously heated to between 600 and 1000\u00b0 C., preferably from 650 to 750\u00b0 C. Even with this high temperature, the semiconductor film is only heated instantaneously, and therefore the substrate 100 itself does not distort and change in shape. The amorphous semiconductor film can thus be crystallized, and a semiconductor film 706 having a crystalline structure can thus be obtained as shown in FIG. 7B. Crystallization by this type of process was first achieved by forming the catalytic containing layer.",
        "If furnace annealing is used as another method of crystallization, then heating is performed at 500\u00b0 C. for on the order of 1 hour as a preprocess to heat treatment in order to release hydrogen contained in the amorphous structure semiconductor film 704. Heat treatment is then performed within a nitrogen atmosphere using an electric furnace at a temperature of 550 to 600\u00b0 C., preferably at 580\u00b0 C. for four hours, crystallizing the amorphous structure silicon film 704. The crystalline structure silicon film 706 shown in FIG. 7B is thus formed.",
        "In addition, irradiation of laser light to the crystalline structure silicon film 706 is effective for increasing the crystallinity (the proportion of crystal components in the entire volume of the film) and for repairing defects remaining within crystal grains. Excimer laser light having a wavelength equal to or less than 400 nm, and the second harmonic and the third harmonic of a YAG laser may be used. Whichever laser is employed, pulse laser light having a repetition frequency of approximately 10 to 1000 Hz is used, and the laser light is condensed by an optical system so as to have a power density of 100 to 400 mJ/cm2. Laser processing may then be performed on the crystalline structure semiconductor film 706 while using an overlap ratio of 90 to 95%.",
        "The catalytic element (nickel here) remains in the crystalline structure semiconductor film 706 thus obtained. The distribution is not uniform throughout the film, but the catalytic element with a concentration that exceeds 1\u00d71019/cm3 in average remains in the crystalline structure semiconductor film 706. It is of course possible to form various types of semiconductor elements, such as TFTs, in this state, but the catalytic element is removed by gettering in accordance with the process shown below.",
        "First, a thin barrier layer 707 is formed in the surface of the crystalline structure semiconductor film 706 as shown in FIG. 7C. There are no particular limitations placed on the thickness of the barrier layer 707, and chemical oxide formed simply by aqueous ozone processing may also be substituted. Further, chemical oxide can also be similarly formed by processing with an aqueous solution in which acid such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, or nitric acid is mixed with hydrogen peroxide. Plasma processing within an oxygen atmosphere, or oxidation processing by generating ozone due to the irradiation of ultraviolet light within an oxygen containing atmosphere may also be performed as other methods of forming the barrier layer. In addition, a thin oxide film formed by heating at a temperature of 200 to 350\u00b0 C. using a clean oven may also be used as the barrier layer. Alternatively, an oxide film having a thickness on the order of 1 to 5 nm may also be deposited as the barrier layer by using a method such as plasma CVD, sputtering, or evaporation.",
        "A semiconductor film 708 is then formed having a thickness of 25 to 250 nm on the barrier layer by plasma CVD or sputtering. Typically, an amorphous silicon film containing from 0.01 to 20 atomic % of argon is formed by sputtering using argon. The semiconductor film 708 is later removed, and therefore it is preferable to use a low density film in order to increase its selectivity with the crystalline structure semiconductor film 706 during etching. Gettering sites can be formed if an inert gas element is added within the amorphous silicon film, and an inert gas element is similarly placed throughout the film.",
        "One element, or a plurality of elements, chosen from the group consisting of helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), and xenon (Xe) are used as the inert gas element. The inert gas element is used as an ion source in order to form gettering sites in the present invention, and the inert gas element is injected into the semiconductor film by ion doping or ion injection. There are two reasons for injecting the ions of the inert gas element. One is that dangling bonds are formed by injection, imparting distortion to the semiconductor film, and the other reason is that the ions are injected within the semiconductor film lattice, also imparting distortion. Injection of the inert gas ions can satisfy both the reasons at the same time, but in particular, remarkable results can be obtained due to the latter reason when using elements having a larger atomic size than silicon, such as argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), and xenon (Xe).",
        "It becomes necessary to perform heat treatment afterward in order to achieve gettering with certainty. Furnace annealing or RTA is performed for the heat treatment. When furnace annealing is used, heat treatment is performed for 0.5 to 12 hours at a temperature of 450 to 600\u00b0 C. in a nitrogen atmosphere. Further, if RTA is used, a heating lamp light source is turned on for 1 to 60 seconds, preferably from 30 to 60 seconds, and this is repeated between 1 and 10 times, preferably between 2 and 6 times. The intensity of the light emitted from the lamp light source may be arbitrarily set, but processing is performed such that the semiconductor film is heated instantaneously to a temperature of 600 to 1000\u00b0 C., preferably to a temperature between 700 and 750\u00b0 C.",
        "During gettering, the catalytic elements in regions to be gettered (capture sites) are released by thermal energy, and then move to the gettering sites by diffusion. Gettering therefore depends on the processing temperature, and the time needed for gettering to proceed becomes shorter as the processing temperature becomes higher. As shown by the arrow in FIG. 7E, there is a distance on the order of the thickness of the semiconductor film in the movement direction for the catalytic elements, and therefore gettering can be accomplished in a relatively short period of time.",
        "Note that the semiconductor film 708 containing the inert gas elements at a concentration equal to or greater than 1\u00d71020/cm3, is not crystallized by this heat treatment. This is thought to be because the inert gas elements are not released again and remain within the film in the above stated processing temperature range, thus inhibiting crystallization of the semiconductor film.",
        "Thereafter, the amorphous semiconductor film 708 is then selectively etched and removed. Dry etching by ClF3 not using plasma, and wet etching by an alkaline solution such as an aqueous solution containing hydrazine or tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide (chemical formula (CH3)4NOH) can be used as etching methods. The barrier layer 707 functions as an etching stopper at this time. Further, the barrier layer 707 may be removed later by using hydrofluoric acid.",
        "A semiconductor film 710 having a crystalline structure and in which the concentration of the catalytic element is lowered to be equal to, or less than, 1\u00d71017/cm3, can thus be obtained as shown in FIG. 7E. The crystalline structure semiconductor film 710 thus formed is one in which thin rod shape or thin flattened rod shape crystals are formed due to the catalytic element action, and crystal growth is such that there is a specific directionality present in each of the crystals when viewed macroscopically. The crystalline structure semiconductor film 710 manufactured in Embodiment 3 can be applied to the semiconductor films shown in Embodiment 1 or 2.",
        "Another method of gettering the catalytic elements remaining in the crystalline structure semiconductor film 706 obtained in Embodiment 3 is shown in FIGS. 8A to 8C. A silicon oxide film as a mask is formed having a thickness of 150 nm on the crystalline structure semiconductor film 706, and a resist mask 712 is formed. A mask insulating film 711 is next obtained by etching the silicon oxide film. A noble gas element, or a noble gas element and phosphorous, or just phosphorous is then injected into the crystalline semiconductor film 706 by ion doping, forming gettering sites 713.",
        "Heat treatment is then performed by furnace annealing within a nitrogen atmosphere at 450 to 600\u00b0 C. for 0.5 to 12 hours, as shown in FIG. 8B. The catalytic element remaining in the crystalline structure semiconductor film 706 can thus be moved to the gettering sites 713 and concentrated.",
        "The crystalline structure semiconductor film 710 can then be obtained by removing the mask insulating film 711 and the gettering sites by etching. The crystalline structure semiconductor film 710 manufactured by Embodiment 4 can be applied to the semiconductor films shown by Embodiments 1 and 2.",
        "A 1 to 10 nm thick silicon nitride film can also be used as the base insulating film formed on the substrate 701 in Embodiment 3. FIG. 9 shows a state in which the crystalline structure semiconductor film 706, the barrier layer 707, the semiconductor film 708, and the semiconductor film 709 into which a noble gas element is added have been manufactured by processes similar to those of Embodiment 3, using such a silicon nitride film as a base insulating film 720, after which gettering has been performed by heat treatment. A catalytic element such as nickel has a quality of being captured by oxygen or in the vicinity of oxygen. The catalytic element can therefore be moved easily from the crystalline structure semiconductor film 706 to the semiconductor film 708, or to the semiconductor film 709 to which the inert gas element has been added, by forming the base insulating film from a silicon nitride film. The semiconductor films can be applied to the semiconductor films shown in Embodiments 1 and 2.",
        "A case of using a semiconductor film (typically silicon), obtained by heat treatment at a high temperature, in a semiconductor layer containing a channel forming region, a source region, and a drain region is explained in Embodiment 6. (The semiconductor film is hereafter referred to as a high temperature polysilicon film.)",
        "An amorphous semiconductor film is formed on a quartz substrate having high heat resistivity by using PECVD. Heat treatment is performed next for 24 hours at a temperature of 600\u00b0 C. using a furnace, forming a crystalline semiconductor film. Note that a silicon oxide film is formed on the semiconductor film surface during this crystallization process, but this does not pose any problems because the silicon oxide film is an extremely thin film that can be removed by a process such as etching.",
        "The oxide film formed on the surface of the crystalline semiconductor film is removed next, and then heat treatment for forming a gate insulating film is performed. The crystalline semiconductor film is heat treated at a temperature of 900 to 1050\u00b0 C., and an oxide film is formed on the surface of the crystalline semiconductor film. This silicon oxide film is used as the gate insulating film. A silicon oxide film may then be formed on the surface of the crystalline semiconductor film by performing heat treatment of the crystalline semiconductor film such that the final film thickness of the crystalline semiconductor film becomes 30 to 50 nm.",
        "The semiconductor film thus obtained by high temperature heat treatment has good crystallinity and a high electric field effect mobility. TFTs having superior characteristics can be achieved by using the semiconductor film in a semiconductor layer containing a channel forming region, a source region, and a drain region. In addition, a semiconductor device having high reliability can be realized by using the TFTs in circuits. It is possible to combine Embodiment 6 with Embodiments 1 and 2.",
        "An example of a process of manufacturing a light emitting device is explained in Embodiment 7 using FIG. 15.",
        "FIG. 15 is an example showing the structure of an active matrix drive light emitting device. An n-channel TFT 652 and a p-channel TFT 653 of a drive circuit portion, and a switching TFT 654 and an electric current control TFT 655 of a pixel portion 651 shown here are manufactured by processes similar to those of Embodiment 1 according to the present invention.",
        "A first interlayer insulating film 618 made from silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride is formed on gate electrodes 608 to 611, and is used as a protective film.

        "The circuit structure of the driver circuit portion 650 differs between a gate signal line driver circuit and a data signal line driver circuit, but this is omitted here. Wirings 612 and 613 are connected to the n-channel TFT 652 and to the p-channel TFT 653, and circuits such as shift registers, latch circuits, and buffer circuits are formed by using those TFTs.",

Further, a source side of the electric current control TFT 655 is connected to an electric power source supply wiring 617, and a drain side electrode 616 is connected to an anode of a light emitting element.",
        "A first interlayer insulating film 618 is then formed, and a second interlayer insulating film 619 is formed next. An inorganic insulating material may be formed having an average film thickness from 1.0 to 2.0 \u03bcm as the second interlayer insulating film 619. A silicon oxide film or a silicon oxynitride film may be formed as an inorganic resin film using a known sputtering method or plasma CVD method. In addition, the inorganic resin film may be formed by plasma CVD using SiH4 and N2O as raw material gasses if a silicon oxynitride film is used, with film deposition conditions of a pressure of 0.3 torr, a substrate temperature of 400\u00b0 C., an RF output of 100 W, and raw material gas flow rates of 4 sccm and 400 sccm for SiH4 and N2O, respectively. Further, an SOG film may also be used as the second interlayer insulating film 619. In addition, the second interlayer insulating film 619 may also be manufactured using an organic insulating film such as acrylic.",
        "Note that it is preferable to polish and level the surface of the second interlayer insulating film 619, by using a technique referred to as CMP (chemical mechanical polishing) for cases in which the second interlayer insulating film 619 is manufactured using an inorganic insulating film. CMP is a method in which a surface of a workpiece to be polished is taken as a standard, and chemical and mechanical leveling is performed on the surface. In general, a polishing cloth or a polishing pad (hereafter referred to as a pad in this specification) is attached to a platen or a polishing plate. The platen or polishing plate, and the piece to be polished, are then each rotated or oscillated while a slurry is supplied between the workpiece and the polishing pad. Processing of the surface of a polishing agent is thus performed by a compound chemical and mechanical action. Note that polishing is performed such that the average film thickness of the second interlayer insulating film 619 is set on the order of 1.0 to 2.0 \u03bcm after the leveling process by CMP is complete.",
        "A third insulating film 620 and a fourth insulating film 621 are then formed. The fourth insulating film 621 made from silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride fulfills a role of protecting the semiconductor film that is the main structural element of the TFT from contamination by alkaline metals or organic substances contained within an organic compound layer 624, as well as protecting the organic compound layer 624 from degradation due to oxygen and moisture.",
        "A transparent conductive film having a thickness of 80 to 120 nm is formed next on the fourth insulating film 621, and an anode 622 is formed by etching. Note that an indium tin oxide (ITO) film or a transparent conductive film in which indium oxide is mixed with 2 to 20% zinc oxide (ZnO), is used as a transparent electrode in Embodiment 7.",
        "In order to form a barrier layer 623 which covers edge portions of the anode 622, a film of a material such as resist, polyimide, polyamide, acrylic, BCB (benzocyclobutene), or silicon oxide is formed. Provided that the barrier layer has insulating properties, both organic and inorganic materials may be used. Note that if a photosensitive acrylic is used to form the barrier layer, it is preferable to perform heat treatment at a temperature of 180 to 350\u00b0 C. after etching a film of the photosensitive acrylic. Furthermore, it is preferable to perform heat treatment at a temperature of 180 to 350\u00b0 C. and then to perform etching, forming the barrier layer 623, if the barrier layer is formed using a non-photosensitive acrylic film. The barrier layer may be formed by a method such as CVD if a silicon oxide film is used.",
        "An organic compound layer 624 and a cathode 625 are then formed by evaporation on the anode 622 and the barrier layer 623. Note that although an MgAg electrode is used as the cathode of the light emitting elements in Embodiment 7, other known materials may also be used. In addition, the organic compound layer 624 may be formed by combining and laminating a plurality of layers, such as a hole injecting layer, a hole transporting layer, an electron transporting layer, an electron injecting layer, and a buffer layer, in addition to a light emitting layer. The detailed structure of the organic compound layer 624 may be arbitrarily determined.",
        "An organic light emitting element 626 composed of the anode 622, the organic compound layer 624, and the cathode 625 is thus formed.",
