        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a figure selection method, a figure selection device, and a storage medium storing a figure selection program when an arbitrary figure is selected for editing to make correction, transfer, copy, cancellation, grouping, conversion into 2D(two dimension)/3D(three dimension), and so on, in a CAD system or the like.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "A selection operation of a figure to be edited is frequently repeated for editing to make correction, transfer, copy, cancellation, grouping, conversion into 2D(two dimension)/3D(three dimension) and and so on, in a CAD system or the like.",
        "A figure is generally represented by a point, a line, a plane, a solid, or a collection thereof or a part thereof (edge or the like). A figure element is a basic unit to form a figure, and it is broadly represented by a point, a line, a plane, a solid, or a collection thereof or a part thereof (edge or the like). Narrowly speaking, however, a figure element is represented by a line, but in the present specification, it is represented by linear data including a straight line, a curved line, a circle, an arc, a spline curved line and the like.",
        "FIG. 1 is a diagram explaining a pick-method of the first prior art.",
        "In FIG. 1, in order to select a figure 5100 formed by figure elements 5101, 5102, 5103, 5104, 5105, 5106, 5107 and 5108 using a pick-method, an arrow-shaped pointer 5110 is displayed on a display using an input unit such as a mouse or the like, and the mouse is clicked placing a head of the pointer 5110 on at least six figure elements 5101, 5102, 5103, 5104, 5106, and 5108, thereby selecting the desired figure 5100.",
        "FIG. 2 is a diagram explaining a chain retrieval method of the second prior art. In FIG. 2, in order to select a figure 5200 formed by figure elements 5201 to 5104 using a chain retrieval method, an arrow-shaped pointer 5210 is displayed on a display using an input unit such as a mouse or the like similarly to the pick-method, and the mouse is clicked placing a head of the pointer 5210 on the figure element 5201 which is one of the figure elements forming the figure 5200 to be selected. Thus, the system automatically selects figure elements 5202, 5203, and 5204 which uniformally follow the figure element 5201, thereby selecting the desired figure 5200.",
        "FIG. 3 is a diagram explaining a maximum/minimum closed-loop retrieval method of the third prior art.",
        "In FIG. 3, an arrow-shaped pointer 5320 is displayed on a display using an input unit such as a mouse or the like, and the mouse is clicked placing a head of the pointer 5320 on a figure element 5301 which is one of the figure elements. Thus, in the maximum closed-loop retrieval method, the system retrieves a maximum closed-loop figure 5330 formed by figure elements 5301, 5302, 5303, 5304, 5305, 5306, 5307 and 5308. In the minimum closed-loop retrieval method, the system retrieves a minimum closed-loop figure 5340 formed by figure elements 5301, 5308, 5309, and 5310. Thus, desired figures 5330 and 5340 are selected.",
        "As the forth prior art, there is a combination method of combining more than two methods of the above-mentioned pick-method, chain retrieval method, and maximum/minimum closed-loop retrieval method. When a desired figure is selected by the combination method, a desired figure is selected while selecting the respective methods depending on each mode in such a way that the pick-method is used in a pick-mode, the chain retrieval method is used in a chain retrieval mode, the maximum closed-loop retrieval method is used in a maximum closed-loop retrieval mode, and the minimum closed-loop retrieval method is used in a minimum closed-loop retrieval mode.",
        "In the figure selection method described in each prior art, however, there have been the following problems.",
        "In the case of the pick-method of the first prior art, operations should be performed many times for the selection of a desired figure. The mouse should be clicked on a figure element at least six times in order to select, for example, the figure 5100 shown in FIG. 1.",
        "In the case of the chain retrieval method of the second prior art, the mouse is clicked on a figure element only one time, but only the figure formed by a group of figure elements following the mouse-clicked figure element can be selected. Therefore, the shape of a figure which can be selected is restricted. For example, the figure 5200 shown in FIG. 2 can be selected by clicking the figure element 5201 one time using a mouse. This is because the figure elements 5202, 5203 and 5204 are sequentially and uniformally determined following the figure element 5201. That is, only a figure in which another figure element is not connected with the connection part of two figure elements can be selected.",
        "In the case of the maximum/minimum closed-loop retrieval method of the third prior art, a figure element is clicked only one time using a mouse similarly to the chain retrieval method. Further, a figure in which another figure element is connected with the connection part of two figure elements can be selected. The thus-selected figure is an outermost closed-loop figure, or an innermost closed-loop figure which contains a mouse-clicked figure element.",
        "In the case of the combination method of the forth prior art, a figure can be selected making use of each advantage of the above-mentioned conventional figure selection methods described in the first to third prior arts. However, an additional operation such as the switching of each mode is required.",
        "When the chain retrieval method or the maximum/minimum closed-loop retrieval method is used, figure elements to be connected cannot be retrieved by these methods in the following cases:",
        "(1) Two figure elements to be connected are not connected in the case where errors are generated while a figure is being prepared or in the case where existing data stored in an old CAD system which uses precision data with single precision are transferred to a new CAD system which uses precision data with double precision; and\n\n(2) A cause-and-effect relationship exists between two figure elements even if they are not really connected as in the case where the figure elements are omitted or the figure elements are hidden lines.",
        "The present invention has been developed to solve the above-mentioned problems, and aims at realizing a figure selection method, a figure selection device, and a storage medium storing a figure selection program, for selecting a desired figure with a minimum number of operations.",
        "In a first aspect of the present invention, a figure selection method is a method for selecting a figure formed by a plurality of a figure element, and the method is arranged to include a retrieval process of figure elements adjacent to the designated figure element.",
        "In a second aspect of the present invention, a figure selection device is a device selecting a figure formed by a plurality of figure elements, and the device is arranged to include a figure element designation unit designating a figure element and a figure element retrieval unit retrieving a figure element adjacent to the designated figure element.",
        "In a third aspect of the present invention, a computer-readable medium storing a figure selection program is a storage medium storing a figure selection program selecting a figure formed by a plurality of figure elements, and the medium is configured to retrieve a figure element adjacent to the designated figure element.",
        "The present invention retrieves a figure element in the neighborhood of the designated figure element.",

In the case of a list-display and selection method (step S92), the branch display unit 124 list-displays (step S93) or list/tree-displays (step S94) all the branches retrieved by the respective retrieval processes, in a predetermined color (candidate color), based on the information registered in Tables 7 to 11. In the case of a switch display and retrieval method (step S95), the branch display unit 124 sequentially displays (step S96) or list/tree-displays (step S97) the branches retrieved by the respective retrieval processes, based on the information registered in Tables 7 to 11.",
        "The explanation will return to the flowchart of FIG. 31. In step S10, in order to select the branches displayed by the branch display process, the branch selection prompt process is performed for the operator. The figure selection system 100 is under a waiting state corresponding to a display method determined by the branch display process.",

When the sequential display in step S96 or the list/tree display in step S97 is displayed by the branch display process, the branch selection prompt process is performed by each function of a switch input process of sequentially switching displays of the respective branches using a keyboard (step S103), a menu button for switching the screens (step S104), and a navigation process for activating the neighborhood of a cursor (step S105).",
        "The explanation returns to the flowchart of FIG. 31.",
        "In steps S11a and S11b, the input information inputted in step S10 is determined. In the case where the inputted information is about figure elements other than a branch, that is, the information is about figure elements other than the figure elements determined in step S14, S17, or S20 described later (step S12), an error message to promote re-input is displayed (step S13), and the flow returns to the branch selection prompt process in step S10.",
        "In the case where the information inputted in step S10 is about branches (or figure-element-specifying branches) (step S14), a branch determination process is performed.",
        "FIG. 39 is a flowchart of a branch determination process.",
        "In FIG. 39, the branch element retrieval unit 210 registers the last figure element of a branch which is selected in step S15, as a reference element in Tables 3 and 4. Then, the unit registers the branch selected in Table 1, in step S16. The unit determines a type of the selected branch (step S161). In the case of an end-connected element (step S162), the unit registers the information registered in Tables 9 and 10, in Tables 1 and 2. In the case where a type of the selected branch is a crossed element (step S163), the unit registers the information registered in Tables 7 and 8, in Tables 1 and 2. In the case where a type of the selected branch is the shape-corrected branch element (step S161 and step S164), the unit registers the information registered in Tables 11, in Tables 1 and 2.",

        "As shown in FIG. 40, the figure element ID of the last figure element of a selected branch and its coordinate value are registered in Table 3. In Table 4, the retrieval direction is registered.",
        "The explanation will return to the flowchart of FIG. 31. In the case where the information inputted in step S10 is about a figure element of the determined continuous-line-group (step S17), the trial and error support process is performed.",
        "FIG. 41 is a flowchart of a trial-and-error support process.",
        "In FIG. 41, the trial-and-error support unit 220 registers a figure element immediately before the figure element designated (selected) in step S18, in Tables 3 and 4 as a reference element. Then, in step S19, the unit cancels (removes) the information about figure elements following the designated figure element from the information registered in Tables 1 and 2.",

        "As shown in FIG. 42, the ID of a figure element immediately before the designated figure element and its coordinate value are registered in Table 3, and no data is inputted in Table 4.",
        "The explanation will return to the flowchart of FIG. 31. After performing the process in step S16 or S19, the flow returns to the closed-loop check process in step S4.",
        "FIG. 43 is a flowchart of the closed-check process.",
        "The closed-loop check process is performed in such a way that the closed-loop check unit 230 checks whether or not the continuous-line-group extracted by the extraction process is loop-shaped when the continuous-line-group extraction process is repeated in the flow of FIG. 31.",
        "In step S41 of FIG. 43, it is determined in step S16 whether or not the ID of the figure element registered in Table 1 is registered twice in Table 1. In the case of double registration (step S42), it is determined that a loop has been generated. Then, the notification message is displayed (step S43), an inquiry about the determination is displayed, and a process is in a state of waiting for the determination (step S44). When the determination is inputted (step S45 and step S46), the loop information is transmitted to a figure process system 110 (step S47), and the closed-loop check process terminates. In step S41, in the case where there is no double registration, it is determined that a loop has not been generated (step S48), and the closed-loop check process terminates.",
        "The explanation will return to the flowchart of FIG. 31. When the information inputted in step S10 is \u201cselection determination\u201d (step S20), a termination process for terminating the continuous-line-group extraction process is performed.",

        "In FIG. 44, after step S20, the information which is stored in Tables 1 and 2 and which is under a condition where the extraction of a continuous-line-group is determined, is transmitted to the figure process system 110 in step 201. Then, the figure process system 110 performs a process, and all the continuous-line-group extraction processes terminate.",
        "Next, the continuous-line-group extraction process will be specifically explained using some examples in reference to FIGS. 45 to 50.",
        "In a figure in which 11 figure elements 4201, 4202, 4203, 4204, 4205, 4206, 4207, 4208, 4209, 4210 and 4211 are drawn as shown FIG. 45, the operation for an operator to select an arbitrarily desired figure 4230 and its display will be explained hereinafter. Assume that two generations have been determined to be displayed as candidate branches. That is, 2 is registered in item \u201cgeneration\u201d in Table 7.",
        "As shown in FIG. 46, an operator places the head of an arrow-shaped pointer 4320 on the figure element 4201 using an input unit such as a mouse or the like, and clicks the mouse. Thus, the figure element 4201 is designated as the head figure element of the continuous-line-group 4230 desired by the operator. Then, the ID of the figure element 4201 is registered in item \u201cfigure element ID\u201d in Table 1, setting the figure element 4201 as a reference element. The ID of the figure element 4201 is registered in item \u201cfigure element ID\u201d, and a coordinate value of the pointer 4320 is registered in item \u201creference point coordinate value\u201d, in Table 3. Then, the figure element 4201 is echo-displayed in a predetermined color (in FIG. 46, the element is displayed by a bold line).",
        "Next, a retrieval processes for the first generation (the crossed-element retrieval process, the end-connected-element retrieval process, the shape-corrected branch element retrieval process, or the like) are performed based on the information registered in Table 3. Since a branch element observed from the figure element 4201 is only the figure element 4202 retrieved by the crossed-element retrieval process as shown in FIG. 47, 1 is registered in item \u201ccrossed element number\u201d in Table 5, and the ID of the figure element 4202 is registered in item \u201ccrossed figure element ID\u201d. Further, the figure element 4202 is displayed in a predetermined candidate color (in the figure, a dotted line). Then, information about the figure element 4202 is registered as a branch candidate in Tables 7 and 8.",
        "Since the figure element retrieved by the retrieval process for the first generation is only figure element 4201, a retrieval process for the second generation is performed setting the figure element 4201 as a reference element. Next, three figure elements such as the figure elements 4203 and 4204 retrieved by the crossed-element retrieval process and a figure element 4203 retrieved by the end-connected-element retrieval process are recognized as branch candidates observed from the figure element 4202. Then, information about the figure elements are registered in the respective tables. When a branch candidate retrieved by the end-connected-element retrieval process is one for the respective ends of the reference element, or when a branch candidate retrieved by the end-connected element retrieval process is an end of the other side in the case where a reference candidate is the branch retrieved by the end-connected-element retrieval process, the end-connected-element retrieval process is recursively performed regardless of the established number of generations. Five figure elements such as figure elements 4203, 4204, and 4209 to 4211 are recognized as branch candidates observed from the figure element 4202 by the retrieval process for the second generation including the recursively performed end-connected-element retrieval process. The information about the figure elements are registered in the respective tables. As shown in FIG. 48, the figure elements are displayed in a predetermined candidate color. Since the established generation number is 2, the process will enter an input-waiting state.",
        "As shown in FIG. 49, an operator places the head of the pointer 4520 on the figure element 4204, and clicks the mouse to designate a figure element 4204, which is one of the branch candidates.",
        "When the figure element 4204 is designated, FIG. 50 is displayed by the coordinate value of the pointer 4520, which is registered in Table 3 as a reference point coordinate value of figure element 4204, crossed coordinate values of the figure elements 4202 and 4204 are registered in Table 6, the direction (arrow in the figure) is registered in Table 4 and the like.",
        "Further, by designating the figure element 4204, a retrieval process for the new first generation is performed by setting the figure element 4204 as a reference element. The difference from the above-mentioned retrieval process for the first generation lies in the fact that information about the direction is registered in Table 4. In a retrieval process for the new first generation, a figure element retrieved by the respective retrieval processes as a branch candidate based on the information about the direction is only a figure element 4208 as shown in FIG. 51. Although a figure element 4207 crosses the figure element 4204, the element 4207 is not regarded as a branch candidate since it is located ahead of the reference point.",
        "As mentioned above, the continuous-line-group extraction process is performed, and an operator can select the desired figure 4230 by designating only figure elements 4201 and 4204.",
        "With respect to a method of displaying a figure element which is a candidate for selection or a designated figure element, any method is available if the above-mentioned figure element can be distinguished from the other elements. For example, a method of displaying the figure element in a bold line, in a different color, or flashing is also available. Another example is a method of relatively highlighting the figure element by coloring the other figure elements gray. Still another example is a method of displaying the element figure in a separate window after it is reduced or simplified.",
        "The present invention can apply to any single device, any system or any integrated device composed of several devices, or any system performing a process via a network such as LAN, WAN or the like, if the functions of the present invention can be performed.",
        "As shown in FIG. 52, the present invention can be realized by a system composed of a CPU 4901 connected with a bus 4909, a memory 4902 such as ROM or RAM, an input device 4903, an output device 4904, an external storage device 4905, a medium drive device 4906, a portable storage medium 4910, and a network connection device 4907. That is, the present invention can also be realized by installing a system or a device the memory 4902 such as ROM or RAM, the external storage device 4905, and the portable storage medium 4909 which store the program code of software for realizing a system of each above-mentioned embodiment, so that a computer (or CPU 4901 or MPU) of the system or the device reads out the program code to be performed.",
        "In this case, the program code which is read out by each storage medium can realize a new function of the present invention. Therefore, the portable storage medium 4910 which stores the program code forms the present invention.",
        "As the portable storage medium 4910 for supplying a program code, for example, a floppy disk, a hard disk, an optical disk, a magneto-optical disk, a CD-ROM, a CD-R, a DVD-ROM, a DVD-RAM, a magnetic tape, a nonvolatile memory, a ROM card, various kinds of storage media using the network connection device 4907 (in other word, communication line) such as E-mail, personal communication communications or the like, can be used.",
        "As shown in FIG. 53, the function of the above-mentioned embodiment is realized by executing a program code which is read out from a memory 5001 via a computer 5000. In addition, the function is also realized by performing part or all of the processes via an OS on the computer 5000 based on the program code.",
        "Further, the function can be realized in such a way that after a program code which is read out by the portable storage medium 5010 is written in a memory accommodated in (1) an expansion board installed in the computer 5000 or (2) a function expansion unit connected with the computer, a CPU accommodated in the function expansion board or the function expansion unit performs part or all of the processes based on the instructions of the program code.",
        "As mentioned above, using a figure selection method, a figure selection device, and a storage medium storing a figure selection program of the present invention, an operator can reduce the number of operations for selecting a desired figure. Therefore, he/she can efficiently select the desired figure in a short time."
