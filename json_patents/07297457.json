    "description": [
        "The photosensitive members described herein can be used as photosensitive members, photoreceptors or photoconductors useful in electrostatographic, including printers, copiers, other reproductive devices, and digital apparatuses. In specific embodiments, the photosensitive member comprises an elastomeric charge transport layer, having a specific glass transition temperature, and a protective overcoat layer.",
        "Electrophotographic imaging members, including photoreceptors or photoconductors, typically include a photoconductive layer formed on an electrically conductive substrate or formed on layers between the substrate and photoconductive layer. The photoconductive layer is an insulator in the dark, so that during machine imaging processes, electric charges are retained on its surface. Upon exposure to light, the charge is dissipated, and an image can be formed thereon, developed using a developer material, transferred to a copy substrate, and fused thereto to form a copy or print. Electrophotographic imaging members are typically in rigid drum configuration and flexible belt form. Flexible imaging member belts may either be seamed or seamless belts. However, for reasons of simplicity, the disclosures hereinafter will focus only on electrophotographic imaging members in flexible belt form.",
        "In typical negatively-charged electrophotographic imaging members, the top outermost exposed photoconductive layer is a charge transport layer. Therefore, the charge transport layer not only is repeatedly subjected to various machine subsystems mechanical interactions, it is also constantly exposed to corona effluents (emitted from charging device), and other volatile chemical (VOC) species/contaminants. Mechanical interactions against imaging member have caused charge transport layer wear, while corona effluent and chemical contaminants exposure gives rise to charge transport layer material degradation and lateral charge migration (LCM) problems. Charge transport layer material degradation and wear promote premature onset of mechanical failure and LCM impacts copy image quality print out.",
        "Many advanced imaging systems are based on the use of a flexible imaging member belt mounted over and around a belt support module design using small diameter belt rollers to provide ease of paper stripping. The use of small diameters in belt module support rollers for the benefit of easy paper copy stripping is seen to be negated by the large charge transport layer bending strain induced during dynamic fatigue belt bending and/or flexing over each belt module support roller under normal machine functioning conditions. Imaging member bending strain leads to the development of charge transport layer cracking, which then manifests into copy print-out defects and limits the imaging member belt useful life. Moreover, exhibition of imaging member belt charge transport layer cracking has frequently been found to occur at those belt segments parked over the support rollers during prolong machine idling or overnight and weekend shut off periods brought on as a result of exposure to residual corona effluents and airborne chemical contaminants. The early onset of charge transport layer cracking is a serious belt material failure issue that impacts copy print out quality. This results in cutting short the functional performance of the imaging member belt prior to reaching its intended service belt life goal.",
        "For typical negatively-charged imaging member belts, such as flexible photoreceptor belt designs, there are multiple layers comprised of a supporting substrate, a conductive ground plane, a charge blocking layer, an optional adhesive layer, a charge generating layer, and a outermost exposed charge transport layer. Flexible photoreceptor belts may also require an anti-curl back coating applied to the back side of the support substrate to render belt flatness.",
        "Therefore, it is desired to provide an improved photoreceptor belt having a mechanically robust function, wherein the charge transport layer is less susceptible to cracking induced by fatigue bending, and is less susceptible to material failures due to exposure to contaminants from airborne chemical species and corona effluents.",
        "Embodiments include an imaging member comprising a substrate, a charge transport layer comprising a polymer and a first charge transport material dispersed therein, and wherein the charge transport layer has a glass transition temperature of from about 10 to about 45\u00b0 C.; and an overcoat layer positioned on the charge transport layer, wherein the overcoat layer comprises a second polymer and a second charge transport material dispersed therein.",
        "Embodiments also include an imaging member comprising an imaging member comprising a substrate; a charge transport layer comprising polystyrene and N,N\u2032-diphenyl-N,N\u2032-bis(3-methylphenyl)-[1,1\u2032-biphenyl]-4,4\u2032 diamine dispersed therein, and wherein the charge transport layer has a glass transition temperature of from about 10 to about 45\u00b0 C.; and an overcoat layer positioned on the charge transport layer, wherein the overcoat layer comprises a polymer selected from the group consisting of polycarbonate and polystyrene, and comprises N,N\u2032-diphenyl-N,N\u2032-bis(3-methylphenyl)-[1,1\u2032-biphenyl]-4,4\u2032diamine, and further wherein the overcoat layer has a thickness of from about 1 to about 10 microns.",
        "In addition, embodiments include an imaging member comprising a substrate; a charge transport layer comprising polycarbonate, N,N\u2032-diphenyl-N,N\u2032-bis(3-methylphenyl)-[1,1\u2032-biphenyl]-4,4\u2032diamine, and a glass transition suppressing compound, and wherein the charge transport layer has a glass transition temperature of from about 10 to about 45\u00b0 C.; and an overcoat layer positioned on the charge transport layer, wherein the overcoat layer comprises a polymer selected from the group consisting of polycarbonate and polystyrene, and comprises N,N\u2032-diphenyl-N,N\u2032-bis(3-methylphenyl)-[1,1\u2032-biphenyl]-4,4\u2032diamine, and further wherein the overcoat layer has a thickness of from about 1 to about 10 microns.",
        "Moreover, embodiments include an image forming apparatus for forming images on a recording medium comprising a) a photoreceptor member having a charge retentive surface to receive an electrostatic latent image thereon, wherein the photoreceptor member comprises a substrate, a charge transport layer comprising a polymer and a first charge transport material dispersed therein, and wherein the charge transport layer has a glass transition temperature of from about 10 to about 45\u00b0 C.; and an overcoat layer positioned on the charge transport layer, wherein the overcoat layer comprises a second polymer and a second charge transport material dispersed therein; b) a development component to apply a developer material to the charge-retentive surface to develop the electrostatic latent image to form a developed image on the charge-retentive surface; c) a transfer component for transferring the developed image from the charge-retentive surface to another member or a copy substrate; and d) a fusing member to fuse the developed image to the copy substrate.",
        "For a better understanding, reference may be had to the accompanying figures.",
        "FIG. 1 is an illustration of a general electrostatographic apparatus using a photoreceptor member.",
        "FIG. 2 is an illustration of an embodiment of an improved photoreceptor showing various layers.",
        "The improved photoreceptors described herein comprise an elastomeric charge transport layer with a protective overcoat. The elastomeric charge transport layer disclosed herein is less susceptible to development of premature onset of cracking induced by corona effluents and/or volatile organic chemical contaminants (VOC) exposure. In addition, the elastomeric charge transport layer is more mechanically robust to provide dynamic fatigue flexing and/or bending. This, in turn, allows for reduction or elimination of charge transport layer cracking. The charge transport layer herein is more elastic and has a specific glass transition temperature, to function as an elastomer layer and give elasticity under normal machine image processing conditions. Because of the increased elasticity of the charge transport layer, the layer has a reduced tendency to curl. In addition, the charge transport layer has a lower transition temperature, which causes the material to be soft. As a consequence, it is harder to remove toner with a conventional blade due to the softness of this layer. The overcoat solves these problems, as the overcoat is protective, and in embodiments, is relatively thin and hard. The elastomeric charge transport layer is more susceptible to surface wear by machine interacting subsystems. The overcoat, therefore, offers an effective solution and solves many problems, as the overcoat is protective.",
        "In embodiments, the photoreceptor having the elastomeric charge transport layer, and a protective overcoat, results in a photoreceptor that is less susceptible to cracking, and less susceptible to attack by corona effluents or VOC contaminants.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1, in a typical electrostatographic reproducing apparatus, a light image of an original to be copied is recorded in the form of an electrostatic latent image upon a photosensitive member and the latent image is subsequently rendered visible by the application of electroscopic thermoplastic resin particles, which are commonly referred to as toner. Specifically, photoreceptor 10 (consisting of a flexible member belt mounted over an encircling a rigid drum) is charged on its surface by means of an electrical charger 12 to which a voltage has been supplied from power supply 11. The photoreceptor is then imagewise exposed to light from an optical system or an image input apparatus 13, such as a laser and light emitting diode, to form an electrostatic latent image thereon. Generally, the electrostatic latent image is developed by bringing a developer mixture from developer station 14 into contact therewith. Development can be effected by use of a magnetic brush, powder cloud, or other known development process.",
        "After the toner particles have been deposited on the photoconductive surface of photoreceptor 10, in image configuration, they are transferred to a copy sheet 16 by transfer means 15, which can be pressure transfer or electrostatic transfer. In embodiments, the developed image can be transferred to an intermediate transfer member and subsequently transferred to a copy sheet.",
        "After the transfer of the developed image is completed, copy sheet 16 advances to fusing station 19, depicted in FIG. 1 as fusing and pressure rolls, wherein the developed image is fused to copy sheet 16 by passing copy sheet 16 between the fusing member 20 and pressure member 21, thereby forming a permanent image. Fusing may be accomplished by other fusing members such as a fusing belt in pressure contact with a pressure roller, fusing roller in contact with a pressure belt, or other like systems. Photoreceptor 10, subsequent to transfer, advances to cleaning station 17, wherein any toner left on photoreceptor 10 is cleaned therefrom by use of a blade 22 (as shown in FIG. 1), brush, or other cleaning apparatus.",
        "However, in most cases, photoreceptor 10, used in the electrophotographic imaging apparatus shown in FIG. 1, is a flexible belt mounted over and around a belt support module using numbers of supporting rollers of varying diameters. The photoreceptor belt is constantly subjected to repeated bending strains as the belt flexes over each of the support rollers during dynamic fatigue machine belt imaging process. Fatigue photoreceptor belt bending/flexing is found to cause the charge transport layer cracking problem.",
        "Electrophotographic imaging members or photoreceptors are well known in the art. Electrophotographic imaging members may be prepared by any suitable technique. Referring to FIG. 2, typically, a flexible (for flexible belt configuration) or rigid (for rigid drum design) substrate 1 is provided with an electrically conductive surface or coating 2.",
        "The substrate may be opaque or substantially transparent and may comprise any suitable material having the required mechanical properties. Accordingly, the substrate may comprise a layer of an electrically non-conductive or conductive material such as an inorganic or an organic composition. As electrically non-conducting materials, there may be employed various resins known for this purpose including polyesters, polycarbonates, polyamides, polyurethanes, and the like which are flexible as thin webs. An electrically conducting substrate may be any metal, for example, aluminum, nickel, steel, copper, and the like or a polymeric material, as described above, filled with an electrically conducting substance, such as carbon, metallic powder, and the like or an organic electrically conducting material. The electrically insulating or conductive substrate may be in the form of an endless flexible belt, a web, a rigid cylinder, a sheet and the like. The thickness of the substrate layer depends on numerous factors, including strength desired and economical considerations. Thus, for a drum, this layer may be of substantial thickness of, for example, up to many centimeters or of a minimum thickness of less than a millimeter. On the other hand, the substrate 1 of a flexible imaging member belt may have less thickness, for example, about 250 micrometers, or of minimum thickness less than 50 micrometers, provided there are no adverse effects on the final electrophotographic device.",
        "In embodiments where the substrate layer is not conductive, the surface thereof may be rendered electrically conductive by an electrically conductive coating 2. The conductive coating may vary in thickness over substantially wide ranges depending upon the optical transparency, degree of flexibility desired, and economic factors. Accordingly, for a flexible photoresponsive imaging device, the thickness of the conductive coating may be between about 20 angstroms to about 750 angstroms, or from about 100 angstroms to about 200 angstroms for an optimum combination of electrical conductivity, flexibility and light transmission. The flexible conductive coating may be an electrically conductive metal layer formed, for example, on the substrate by any suitable coating technique, such as a vacuum depositing technique or electrodeposition. Typical metals include aluminum, zirconium, niobium, tantalum, vanadium and hafnium, titanium, nickel, stainless steel, chromium, tungsten, molybdenum, and the like.",
        "For a negatively charged imaging member, an optional hole blocking layer 3 may be applied to the substrate 1. Any suitable and conventional blocking layer capable of forming an effective barrier to holes between the adjacent photoconductive layer 8 (or electrophotographic imaging layer 8) and the underlying conductive surface 2 of substrate 1 may be used.",
        "An optional adhesive layer 4 may be applied to the hole-blocking layer 3. Any suitable adhesive layer well known in the art may be used. Typical adhesive layer materials include, for example, polyesters, polyurethanes, and the like. Satisfactory results may be achieved with adhesive layer thickness between about 0.05 micrometer (500 angstroms) and about 0.3 micrometer (3,000 angstroms). Conventional techniques for applying an adhesive layer coating mixture to the hole blocking layer include spraying, dip coating, roll coating, wire wound rod coating, gravure coating, Bird applicator coating, and the like. Drying of the deposited coating may be effected by any suitable conventional technique such as oven drying, infrared radiation drying, air drying and the like.",
        "At least one electrophotographic imaging layer 8 is formed on the adhesive layer 4, blocking layer 3 or substrate 1. The electrophotographic imaging layer 8 may be a single layer (5 in FIG. 2) that performs both charge-generating and charge transport functions as is well known in the art, or it may comprise multiple layers such as a charge generator layer 5 and charge transport layer 6 in the event that the imaging member is a negatively-charged photoreceptor.",
        "The charge generating layer 5 can be applied to the electrically conductive surface, or on other surfaces in between the substrate 1 and charge generating layer 5.

Although the polystyrene (having a molecular weight of about 45,000 and available from Scientific Polymer Products) was a thermoplastic, which, by itself, had a Tg of about 100\u00b0 C., nonetheless the prepared charge transport layer gave a Tg of about 39\u00b0 C., which was protected by the applied MAKROLON\u00ae 5900 overcoat.",
        "Imaging Member Corona Exposure Testing",
        "The imaging members of all the above examples were evaluated for corona effluents exposure charge transport layer cracking tests.",
        "All the imaging members prepared, as described in the preceding examples, were allowed to sit in the shelf for 5 weeks and then each cut to provide five 2\u2033\u00d73\u2033 sample pieces, followed by individually rolling each cut piece, with the charge transport layer facing outwardly, into a 19 millimeter diameter sample tube. These imaging member sample tubes were then subsequently subjected to corona effluents exposure tests for corona effect assessment. Corona effluents were generated by turning on a charging device in an enclosed large glass tubing operated under 700 micro-amperes and 8 KV conditions. The corona effluent exposure test was carried out by placing these imaging member sample tubes inside the enclosed glass tube, simultaneously exposing the test samples to the gaseous effluents for 6 hours time duration, and under a temperature controlled at 46\u00b0 C. Examination of each of these samples, after exposure test and observed under 70\u00d7 magnification with an optical microscope, had found that corona species interaction with the imaging member charge transport layer (while the sample was under the static bending strain condition) for both imaging members of Examples 1 and 2 did not have development of charge transport layer cracking, while the Comparative Control imaging member counterpart developed extensive corona exposure bending strain induced charge transport layer cracking.",
        "While the invention has been described in detail with reference to specific and embodiments, it will be appreciated that various modifications and variations will be apparent to the artisan. All such modifications and embodiments as may readily occur to one skilled in the art are intended to be within the scope of the appended claims."
