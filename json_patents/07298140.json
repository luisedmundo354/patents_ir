        "The present invention relates to a three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor and a magneto-impedance sensor element, which can be applied to an electronic compass.",
        "Hitherto, there is known a magnetic sensor wherein a one-piece element holding an amorphous wire as a magnetic sensitive member therein is inserted in a tubular bobbin around which a detection coil and a negative feedback coil are wound (see, e.g., Patent Document 1). The one-piece element is manufactured, for example, by arranging the amorphous wire between electrodes disposed at opposite ends of a substrate in its lengthwise direction, and by covering the entire substrate with a gel-like material.",
        "Further, a magnetic bearing sensor comprising two or three sets of thus-constructed magnetic sensors is also known. In that magnetic bearing sensor, individual magnetic sensors are arranged such that the axial directions of respective amorphous wires are substantially orthogonal to each other (see, e.g., Patent Document 2).",
        "Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2001-296127",
        "Patent Document 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 11-64473",
        "However, the known magnetic sensor has the following problems. The magnetic sensor has the structure that the one-piece element having the amorphous wire arranged on the substrate is employed and it is inserted in the tubular bobbin for placement therein. Accordingly, the number of parts and the number of manufacturing steps are increased, and the manufacturing and assembly steps are complicated. Thus, the known magnetic sensor is not adapted for a reduction in size and cost of the sensor.",
        "Also, the known magnetic bearing sensor comprising three sets of magnetic sensors each constructed as described above has the following problems. In addition to an insufficient reduction in size and cost as in the known magnetic sensor, the magnetic bearing sensor comprising three sets of magnetic sensors necessarily accompanies a risk of further enlarging the bulk and increasing the cost.",
        "A first aspect of the present invention resides in a three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor including a first sensor, a second sensor, and a third sensor each constituted by a magneto-impedance sensor element comprising a magnetic sensitive member having a characteristic changed responsive to an external magnetic field, an insulator formed to allow penetration of the magnetic sensitive member therethrough, and an electromagnetic coil made up of foil-like conductive patterns arranged in adjacent relation on an outer surface of the insulator,\n\n    wherein the first sensor, the second sensor, and the third sensor are disposed such that directions in which the magnetic sensitive members in respective sensors have maximum magnetic field detection sensitivities are substantially orthogonal to each other.",
        "The three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor according to the first aspect of the present invention is constituted by employing the first sensor, the second sensor, and the third sensor each constituted by the magneto-impedance sensor element comprising the magnetic sensitive member having a characteristic changed responsive to an external magnetic field, the insulator formed to allow penetration of the magnetic sensitive member therethrough, and the electromagnetic coil made up of the foil-like conductive patterns arranged in adjacent relation on the outer surface of the insulator. Further, in this three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor, those sensors are disposed such that the directions in which the magnetic sensitive members in respective sensors have maximum magnetic sensitivities are substantially orthogonal to each other.",
        "Here, the electromagnetic coil in each sensor is made up of the foil-like conductive patterns. The electromagnetic coil made up of the foil-like conductive patterns can be formed in small size with very high efficiency, for example, by a method using vapor deposition of a metal, a method of etching a metallic thin film and selectively removing the metallic thin film, or a method of coating conductive ink. Therefore, each sensor can be formed in small size and at a low cost. Further, with the electromagnetic coil formed of the conductive patterns, the accuracy in forming the electromagnetic coil is increased, whereby variations in characteristics can be reduced and a highly accurate sensor can be realized.",
        "Moreover, in the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor, the first to third sensors are disposed such that the directions in which the magnetic sensitive members in respective sensors have maximum magnetic sensitivities are substantially orthogonal to each other. Accordingly, the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor employing those sensors each having high quality can be obtained as a superior product having a small size, a low cost and high accuracy.",
        "Thus, the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor according to the first aspect of the present invention has succeeded in realizing not only easier manufacturing and assembly, but also a smaller size. Also, the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor enables highly accurate bearing detection to be performed regardless of its posture.",
        "A second aspect of the present invention resides in a magneto-impedance sensor element made by winding an electromagnetic coil around a magnetic sensitive member having a characteristic changed responsive to an external magnetic field,\n\n    wherein the magneto-impedance sensor element comprises a sensor substrate for holding the magnetic sensitive member, an insulator formed to allow penetration of the magnetic sensitive member therethrough, and an electromagnetic coil made up of foil-like conductive patterns arranged in adjacent relation on an outer surface of the insulator, and\n    wherein the sensor substrate has electrodes extended from the electromagnetic coil and the magnetic sensitive member, the electrodes being formed on one of outer surfaces of the sensor substrate which is substantially orthogonal to the axial direction of the magnetic sensitive member.",
        "The substrate in the magneto-impedance sensor element according to the second aspect of the present invention has the electrodes extended from the electromagnetic coil and the magnetic sensitive member, and the electrodes are formed on one of outer surfaces of the substrate which is substantially orthogonal to the axial direction of the magnetic sensitive member. Therefore, the magneto-impedance sensor element is suitable for the case in which, when mounting the magneto-impedance sensor element to an electronic circuit board or the like, the axial direction of the magnetic sensitive member is to be set in the direction of thickness of the electronic circuit board or the like. In other words, because the surface of the magneto-impedance sensor element on which the electrodes are disposed can be positioned to face in the same direction as that of a mount surface of the electronic circuit board or the like, it is possible to easily perform connection work using leads, etc.",
        "Further, the magneto-impedance sensor element can be fabricated with a two-dimensional process. Therefore, a three-dimensional process requiring a high cost is no longer required, and a cost reduction can be realized.",
        "The magneto-impedance sensor element includes the electromagnetic coil made up of the foil-like conductive patterns arranged in adjacent relation on the outer surface of the insulator which is formed to allow penetration of the magnetic sensitive member therethrough. The conductive patterns forming the electromagnetic coil can be formed in small size with very high efficiency, for example, by a method using vapor deposition of a metal, a method of etching a metallic thin film and selectively removing the metallic thin film, or a method of coating conductive ink. Therefore, the magneto-impedance sensor element can be formed in small size and at a low cost with high accuracy.",
        "Thus, the magneto-impedance sensor element according to the second aspect of the present invention can be obtained as a small-sized, highly-accurate, and low-cost element. Further, the magneto-impedance sensor element is suitable for magnetic sensing in the direction of thickness of the electronic circuit board or the like on which the magneto-impedance sensor element is mounted.",

In this case, the electromagnetic coil can be formed in a smaller cross-sectional area and the size of the magneto-impedance sensor element can be reduced.

        "The magneto-impedance sensor element performs magnetic sensing based on the so-called MI phenomenon that an induced voltage generates in the electromagnetic coil responsive to changes of a current supplied to the magnetic sensitive member. The MI phenomenon occurs in the magnetic sensitive member made of a magnetic material having an electron spin direction in the circumferential direction with respect to the direction of the supplied current. When the current supplied to the magnetic sensitive member is abruptly changed, a magnetic field in the circumferential direction is also abruptly changed, and under the action of the changing magnetic field, the directions of electron spin direction are changed depending on the ambient magnetic field. At the same time, there occur changes in, e.g., internal magnetization and impedance of the magnetic sensitive member. This is the above-mentioned MI phenomenon.",
        "The magneto-impedance sensor element is a element employing the magnetic sensitive member made of a magnetic material having an electron spin direction in the circumferential direction with respect to the direction of the supplied current. When the current supplied to the magnetic sensitive member is abruptly changed, a magnetic field in the circumferential direction is also abruptly changed, and under the action of the changing magnetic field, the directions of electron spin direction are changed depending on the ambient magnetic field. Then, changes occurred in, e.g., internal magnetization and impedance of the magnetic sensitive member at that time are converted to, for example, a voltage or current generated in the magnetic sensitive member or a voltage or current generated at opposite ends of the electromagnetic coil disposed around the magnetic sensitive member.",
        "Also, the magneto-impedance sensor element is preferably constructed such that the intensity of an acting magnetic field is determined by measuring the magnitude of an induced voltage generating at the opposite ends of the electromagnetic coil when the current supplied to the magnetic sensitive member is caused to rise or fall in 10 nano seconds or below.",
        "In such a case, with an abrupt change of the supplied current, it is possible to change the magnetic field in the circumferential direction at a speed comparable to the propagation speed of change in electron spin direction in the magnetic sensitive member, and hence to more reliably develop the MI phenomenon.",
        "With a rise or fall of the supplied current in 10 nano seconds or below, a current change including a high-frequency component of about 0.1 GHz can be caused to act upon the magnetic sensitive member. Then, by measuring the induced voltage generating at the opposite ends of the electromagnetic coil, a resulting change of the internal magnetic field generated in the magnetic sensitive member depending on the ambient magnetic field can be measured as the magnitude of the induced voltage, and the intensity of the ambient magnetic field can be measured with higher accuracy. Here, the term \u201crise or fall of the supplied current\u201d means that a value of the current supplied to the magnetic sensitive member is changed from 10% or below (or 90% or above) of the steady current value to 90% or above (or 10% or below) thereof.",
        "Preferably, the magneto-impedance sensor element is constructed so as to measure the induced voltage generating at the opposite ends of the electromagnetic coil when the current supplied to the magnetic sensitive member is caused to fall.",

In the signal processing circuit 7, the induced voltage of the electromagnetic coil 3 is taken out through synchronous detection 71 that is turned on/off in sync with the pulse signal, and the taken-out induced voltage is amplified by an amplifier 72 at a predetermined amplification factor. Then, the signal amplified by the signal processing circuit 7 is output as an output signal of the electronic circuit. In this example, a cutoff time required for the pulse signal to fall from 90% to 10% of a steady-state value was set to 4 nano seconds.",
        "Thus, in the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor 10a of this example, respective magnetic field components in the X-, Y- and -Z directions are detected by using three MI elements 10 (i.e., the first sensor 101, the second sensor 102, and the third sensor 103) disposed in the predetermined positions of the IC 10. Further, in the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor 10a of this example, the sensors 101 to 103 output X-, Y- and Z-axis outputs having respective phases different from each other, as shown in FIGS. 11 to 13, to the signal processing circuit 7 (FIG. 10) formed in the IC 100.",
        "FIG. 11 shows changes in output signals of a horizontal component of terrestrial magnetism, which were detected by the first sensor 101 and the second sensor 102 when rotating the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor 10a through 360 degrees about the Z-axis in which the elongate groove 11 of the Z-axis direction sensor, i.e., the third sensor 103, was oriented in the vertical direction. Also, FIG. 12 shows changes in output signals detected by the first sensor 101 and the third sensor 103 when rotating the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor 10a about the Y-axis in which the elongate groove 11 of the Y-axis direction sensor, i.e., the second sensor 102, was oriented in the vertical direction. Further, FIG. 13 shows changes in output signals detected by the second sensor 102 and the third sensor 103 when rotating the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor 10a about the X-axis in which the elongate groove 11 of the X-axis direction sensor, i.e., the first sensor 101, was oriented in the vertical direction. In the graphs of FIGS. 11 to 13, the horizontal axis represents a rotational angle about each axis, and the vertical axis represents a magnitude of the output signal of each sensor 101, 102 and 103.",
        "With the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor 10a, simultaneous magnetic sensing in the X-, Y- and Z-directions, which has faced a difficulty in the related art, can be performed by employing three MI elements 10 with high accuracy while realizing a reduction in size. Accordingly, the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor 10a can detect an external magnetic field acting upon it with high accuracy regardless of the sensor posture.",
        "Particularly, in the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor 10a of this example, the third sensor 103 is fabricated with a two-dimensional process and is joined to one side surface of the IC 100 by bonding while the third sensor 103 is held upright. Therefore, a three-dimensional process requiring a high cost is no longer required, and a cost reduction can be realized.",
        "Further, the MI element 10 has a structure utilizing the elongate groove 11 formed in the electrode-wiring substrate 1. Accordingly, the sensor size can be reduced as compared with the case of arranging, for example, a bobbin including an electromagnetic coil wound around it on the electrode-wiring substrate 1. It is also possible to prevent the electromagnetic coil 3 from being externally touched, and to improve mechanical stability.",
        "Moreover, in this example, the amorphous wire 2 is used as the magnetic sensitive member. By utilizing the amorphous wire 2 with superior magnetic sensitivity, the output voltage per winding of the electromagnetic coil 3 can be further increased, and hence the number of windings can be further reduced. This means that the axial length of the MI element 10 can be further shortened. In the MI element 10 of this example, the winding pitch of the electromagnetic coil 3 is realized at 50 \u03bcm, i.e., a value not larger than 100 \u03bcm.",
        "By thus reducing the winding pitch of the electromagnetic coil 3 and increasing the number of windings per coil length, the output voltage can be increased. In other words, that effect of increasing the output voltage can be obtained by setting the winding pitch per unit length of the electromagnetic coil 3 to be not larger than 100 \u03bcm as in this example. Then, the length of the MI element 10 can be relatively reduced with respect to the output voltage.",
        "Still further, in the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor 10a, the first sensor 101 and the second sensor 102 are disposed respectively on the adjacent side wall surfaces 1001, 1002 of the IC 100 that is substantially in the rectangular form and has four side wall surfaces. The third sensor 103 is disposed on one 1003 of the remaining two side wall surfaces.",
        "As described above, in the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor of this example, the sensors 101 to 103 are arranged in an efficient way. In addition, since sensors having the same specifications are employed as the first sensor 101 and the second sensor 102, the number of types of parts constituting the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor 10a can be restrained and hence a cost reduction is realized.",
        "While this example employs the third sensor 103 differing in shape and dimensions from the first and second sensors 101, 102, the first to third sensors 101 to 103 may be all designed to have the same shape and dimensions instead.",
        "While, in this example, the first sensor 101 and the second sensor 102 are disposed on the adjacent side wall surfaces 1001, 1002 of the IC 100 and the third sensor 103 is disposed on one of the remaining two side wall surfaces of the IC 100, the third sensor 103 may be disposed on the side wall surface 1001 instead, on which the first sensor 101 is disposed, as shown in FIG. 14 ((A) of FIG. 14). Also, the third sensor 103 may be disposed on the side wall surface 1002 on which the second sensor 102 is disposed (FIG. 14(B)). Alternatively, the first to third sensors 101 to 103 may be disposed on the same side wall surface (FIG. 14(C)), or the first to third sensors 101 to 103 may be disposed on an upper (or lower) surface of the IC 100 (FIG. 14(D)).",
        "In this example, characteristics of each of the sensors 101 to 103 (see FIG. 3; hereinafter referred to as a \u201cnovel structure sensor\u201d) constituting the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor 10a of Example 1 were evaluated. Details of the evaluation will be described below with reference to FIGS. 15 and 16.",
        "In this example, the novel structure sensor was evaluated by using a similar electronic circuit to that in Example 1.",
        "For comparison with the novel structure sensor in this example, a known sensor shown in FIG. 16, i.e., a bobbin element 9 constituted by a known bobbin-type MI element, was employed as a comparative example. The bobbin element 9 comprises an amorphous wire 92 and an electromagnetic coil 93 with an insulating winding frame (bobbin) 94 interposed between them, to thereby maintain electrical insulation. The amorphous wire 92 used here as the magnetic sensitive member is made of a CoFeSiB-based alloy and has a diameter of 30 \u03bcm.",
        "The electromagnetic coil 93 has an inner diameter of 1.5 mm. The winding frame 94 is provided with two electrodes 95 extended from electromagnetic coil 93 and other two electrodes 95 extended from the amorphous wire 92. The bobbin element 9 has dimensions of 3 mm\u00d72 mm\u00d74 mm. Thus, the known bobbin element 9 has a large bulk. The known sensor of the comparative example using the known bobbin element 9, therefore, has a difficulty in application to portable equipment or the like having a limited space for installation.",
        "FIG. 15 shows results of comparing a magnetic detection characteristic between the known sensor constituted by the known bobbin element 9 (wire length; 2.5 mm, coil diameter; 1.5 mm, and 40 turns) and the novel structure sensor (wire diameter; 20 \u03bcm, wire length; 1.0 mm, coil diameter (circle-equivalent diameter); 66 \u03bcm, and 18 turns). In FIG. 15, the horizontal axis represents an external magnetic field, and the vertical axis represents an output voltage from the signal processing circuit.",
        "As seen from FIG. 15, the known sensor and the novel structure sensor of this example have linear ranges substantially equal to each other, i.e., about \u00b13 G, and the output voltage of the novel structure sensor of this example is 80% or more of that of the known sensor. Thus, in the novel structure sensor of this example, a lowering of the output voltage is restrained for a reduction in size and thickness. The MI element constituting the novel structure sensor of this example is superior in voltage per turn to the bobbin element 9. Comparing with 28 mV/turn of the bobbin element 9, the MI element constituting the novel structure sensor of this example produces about twice voltage per turn, i.e., 53 mV/turn.",
        "In other words, in spite of having a size much smaller than, i.e., about 1/50 of, the known sensor constituted by the bobbin element 9, the novel structure sensor of this example has a superior characteristic, as shown in FIG. 15, that a good linearity is obtained in the magnetic field range of \u00b13 G.",
        "The other construction and operating advantages are the same as those in Example 1.",
        "In this example, each of the sensors 101 to 103 constituting the three-dimensional magnetic bearing sensor of Example 1 was evaluated for a characteristic in detection of terrestrial magnetism.

The insulator 4 is in the form of a rod having a rectangular cross-section, and opposite ends of the amorphous wire 2 are exposed at opposite end surfaces of the insulator 4.",
        "Subsequently, in this example, the electromagnetic coil 3 was formed through the following steps. First, a metal material containing copper was vapor-deposited all over the outer peripheral surface of the rod-shaped insulator 4, thereby forming a metallic thin film. Then, the metallic thin film was partly removed by selective etching to form the electromagnetic coil 3. At the same time as forming the electromagnetic coil 3, in this example, electrodes 52 extended from the opposite ends of the amorphous wire 2 and electrodes 51 extended from opposite ends of the electromagnetic coil 3 were also formed.",
        "More specifically, as shown in FIG. 19, the metallic thin film was removed in ring-shaped areas at positions away from opposite ends of the insulator 4 by a predetermined distance WD1, thus dividing the metallic thin film into three parts.",
        "Thereafter, selective etching was performed on an intermediate metallic thin film 30a to form the conductive patterns 33 constituting the electromagnetic coil 3 and the electrodes 51 extended from the opposite ends of the electromagnetic coil 3.",
        "Metallic thin films 30b at the opposite ends of the electromagnetic coil 3 are electrically connected to the corresponding ends of the amorphous wire 2 penetrating the insulator 4 and function as the electrodes 52 for the amorphous wire 2.",

Two MI elements 10 are disposed on the surface of the IC 100 to serve respectively as a first sensor 101 and a second sensor 102 for measuring the intensities of a magnetic field in the X- and Y-directions, i.e., two orthogonal directions in the surface of the IC 100.
