        "The invention relates to a multiple-output DC-DC converter, an electronic apparatus comprising such a multiple-output DC-DC converter, and a method of controlling a multiple-output DC-DC converter.",
        "WO 02/058220-A1 discloses a single output DC-DC converter in which a main switch periodically couples a DC input voltage to an inductor to store energy in the inductor during an on-period of the main switch. During an off-period of the main switch, a secondary switch couples a load to the inductor to transfer energy from the inductor to the load. A subsequent on and off-period of the main switch is called a switching cycle or a cycle. A ratio of the on-period to the duration of a cycle is called the duty cycle.",
        "The output voltage of the DC-DC converter is regulated by comparing the output voltage across the load with a reference level. If the output voltage is above the reference level, this indicates that the amount of energy supplied to the load is too high. During the next cycle, the duty cycle will have a predetermined minimum value so that the amount of energy stored in the inductor will be minimal. If the output voltage is below the reference level, during the next cycle, the duty cycle will have a predetermined maximum value. The output voltage is thus regulated by using the minimum and the maximum duty cycle only.",
        "This prior art DC-DC converter is unsuitable for providing multiple individually regulated output voltages.",
        "It is an object of the invention to provide a multiple-output DC-DC converter in which the multiple output voltages are each regulated.",
        "A first aspect of the invention provides a multiple-output DC-DC converter as claimed in claim 1. A second aspect of the invention provides an electronic apparatus comprising such a multiple-output DC-DC converter as claimed in claim 16. A third aspect of the invention provides a method of controlling a multiple-output DC-DC converter as claimed in claim 17. Advantageous embodiments are defined in the dependent claims.",
        "The multiple-output DC-DC converter in accordance with the invention comprises an inductor and a main switch which periodically couples a DC-input voltage to the inductor. During the on-time of the main switch, energy is stored in the inductor. Each one of a multitude of loads is coupled via one of a multitude of output switches to the inductor. Across each of the loads, one of a multitude of output voltages is present.",
        "A controller controls the main switch and the output switches in sequences of cycles. Each one of the cycles contains an on-phase of the main switch followed by an on-phase of one of the multitude of output switches. The cycles have either a predetermined first or a second duty cycle which is larger than the first duty cycle. No other duty cycles occur. The first duty cycle is also referred to as the minimum duty cycle, and the second duty cycle is also referred to as the maximum duty cycle.",
        "The controller comprises a multitude of comparators which each compare one of the multitude of output voltages with an associated one of a multitude of reference voltages. The controller further checks whether the number of the multitude of output voltages which have a value above their associated reference voltage, is larger than, smaller than, or equal to the number of the multitude of output voltages which have a value below their associated reference voltage. Depending on the outcome of the check made by the controller, the duty cycles are selected such that the number of cycles with the minimal duty cycle (this number of duty cycles is further referred to as the first number) are larger than, smaller than, or equal to the number of cycles with the maximum duty cycle (this number of duty cycles is further referred to as the second number), respectively.",
        "In this manner, the total energy stored in the inductor will track the total energy required by the loads. For example, if in a DC-DC converter with three outputs, one of the output voltages is above its associated reference voltage (also referred to as reference level, or reference value), and two of the output voltages are below their associated reference level, the energy to be supplied to the first mentioned output should decrease while the energy supplied to the last mentioned output should be increased. Consequently, the total energy stored in the inductor should increase and the number of outputs which require more energy is larger than the number of outputs which require less energy. Thus, in the next sequence of cycles, the number of cycles with the maximum duty cycle should be larger than the number of cycles with the minimum duty cycle.",
        "WO 02/058220-A1 discloses a multiple-output DC-DC converter in which the outputs are independently controlled in either the pulse width modulation (further referred to as PWM mode or the pulse frequency modulation (further referred to as PFM) mode. In the PWM mode, the duty cycles of the outputs differ because for each output the ratio between the input voltage and the output voltage is different. Moreover, the duty cycle is also related the current in the coil of the converter and the total output power provided. Further, the output has to be determined that requires the highest amount of energy. This output has to operate in the PWM mode. Then, the number of switching cycles of any other output operating in the PWM mode is determined from which part of the total amount of energy has to be supplied to a particular output. This prior art DC-DC converter is complex because it has to be determined which output requires the highest amount of energy to control its duty cycle such that sufficient energy will be stored in the inductor, what the duty cycle of the other outputs should be, and how many switching cycles have to be applied for a particular output in the total switching sequence.",
        "The DC-DC converter in accordance with the invention only has to select how many of the two predetermined duty cycles (the minimum and the maximum duty cycle) have to be provided in the total switching sequence.",
        "In an embodiment as defined in claim 2, the number of cycles in a sequence to which the minimum duty cycle is allocated, equals the number of output voltages which have a value above their associated reference voltage. The number of output voltages which have a value equal to their associated reference voltage, are either neglected, or are arbitrarily assigned to the cycles with the minimum or maximum duty cycle. The number of cycles in the sequence to which the maximum duty cycle is allocated equals the number of output voltages that have a value below their associated reference voltage.",
        "In an embodiment as defined in claim 3, as much as possible with the present values of the first number and the second number, one of the cycles with the maximum duty cycle precedes one of the cycles with the minimum duty cycle. In this manner, first, during the cycles with the maximum duty cycle, the average current through the inductor increases, and then, during the cycles with the minimum duty cycle, the average current through the inductor decreases. Consequently, the chance that the current through the inductor becomes zero is minimized.",
        "In an embodiment as defined in claim 4, the order of the cycles in a sequence is selected to first comprise all the cycles with the maximum duty cycle and then all the cycles with the minimum duty cycle. Due to the cycles with the maximum duty cycle, first the average value of the current through the inductor increases, then, due the cycles with the minimum duty cycle, the average value decreases. Again, the chance that the current through the inductor becomes zero is minimized.",
        "In an embodiment as defined in claim 5, the minimum duty cycles are allocated as much as possible to cycles of which the corresponding output voltages have a value below their associated reference voltage. In cycles with the minimum duty cycle, the duration of the on-time of the output switch is larger than in the cycles with the second duty cycle and thus the amount of energy supplied to the associated load is larger. This is exactly what is required at an output with an output voltage below its reference value. Similarly, the maximum duty cycles are allocated as much as possible to cycles of which the corresponding output voltages have a value above their associated reference voltage.",
        "Both the number of the minimum and the maximum duty cycles in a sequence are determined by the number of output voltages above and below their associated reference voltages, respectively. Whereas in contrast, the minimum duty cycles are preferably allocated to output switches corresponding to outputs that have an output voltage below their reference value and the maximum duty cycles are preferably allocated to output switches corresponding to outputs that have an output voltage above their reference value. Usually, there will be no match in the numbers concerned, and, consequently, a maximum duty cycle will be allocated to some of the output voltages with a value below their reference value as defined in claim 7, or a minimum duty cycle will be allocated to some of the output voltages above their reference value, as is defined in claim 6.",
        "In an embodiment as defined in claim 8, in a sequence of cycles, the cycle wherein a lowest amount of energy is transferred is allocated to an output of which the output voltage is above its associated reference voltage. This causes a minimal further increase of this voltage which already has a value higher than its reference value.",
        "In an embodiment as defined in claim 9, the first cycle in a sequence is allocated to an output of which the voltage is above its associated reference voltage and to which a minimum duty cycle is allocated. Usually, the first cycle in a sequence starts with the lowest average value of the current in the inductor. This is due to the fact that cycles with the minimum duty cycle occur at the end of the sequence. This lowest amount of energy should be supplied to an output that is going to receive a much larger amount of energy than required. This is particularly true for an output that has already a voltage above its reference value and to which a minimum duty cycle has to be allocated because there are no maximum duty cycles left.",
        "In an embodiment as defined in claim 10, in a sequence of cycles, the cycle wherein a highest amount of energy is transferred is allocated to an output of which the voltage is below its associated reference voltage. This causes a minimal further decrease of this voltage which already has a value lower than its reference value.",
        "In an embodiment as defined in claim 11, in a sequence, the last cycle to which a maximum duty cycle is allocated is selected to be an output of which the voltage is below its associated reference voltage and to which a maximum duty cycle is allocated. Usually, in a sequence, the last cycle to which a maximum duty cycle is allocated has the highest average value of the current in the inductor. This is due to the fact that cycles with the minimum duty cycle occur at the end of the sequence. This highest amount of energy should be supplied to an output which is going to receive a much smaller amount of energy than required. This is particularly true for an output that already has a voltage below its reference value and to which a maximum duty cycle has to be allocated because there are no minimum duty cycles left.",
        "In an embodiment as defined in claim 12 or 13, if in a particular sequence either the minimum or the maximum duty cycle has to be allocated to an output of which the voltage is above or below its reference level, respectively, in a next sequence the correct duty cycle is allocated to this output. This has the advantage, that the wrong allocating of duty cycles will be averaged over time and thus its negative influence on the regulation of the output voltages concerned is minimized.",
        "In an embodiment as defined in claim 14, the mode of the outputs is tracked.",
        "In an embodiment as defined in claim 15, if the mode indicates that an output does not need to supply current to the load, no switching cycle should be allocated to this output to prevent the output voltage to rise even further.",

The DC-DC converter, which in FIG. 1 is an up-converter 1 comprises a series arrangement of an inductor L and a first switch S1 (the main switch) arranged between a first input terminal 2 and a second input terminal 3 to receive an input voltage Vin. A parallel arrangement of a diode D and a second switch S2 (the output switch) is arranged between the junction of the main switch S1 and the inductor L and the first output terminal 4. The second input terminal 3 and the second output terminal 5 are interconnected. A smoothing capacitor C is arranged between the first output terminal 4 and the second output terminal 5. A load 12 is connected between the first output terminal 4 and the second output terminal 5. A comparator 9 compares the output voltage Vout at the first output terminal 4 with a reference voltage VR at terminal 10 to supply an error signal 11 to the controller 6. The controller 6 supplies the control signals 7 and 8 to control the on and off periods of the main switch S1 and the output switch S2. The current through the inductor L is indicated by IL. The operation of the prior-art DC-DC converter will be elucidated with respect to FIG. 2.",
        "FIG. 2 show signals occurring in the prior-art DC-DC converter of FIG. 1. FIG. 2A shows the output voltage Vout and the reference voltage VR, and FIG. 2B shows the current IL through the inductor L.",
        "FIG. 2 show that each cycle CY has two phases. During the first phases which start at the instants t0, t2, t4, t6, t8, the main switch S1 is closed during the on-time TON while the output switch S2 is open. During the second phases which start at the instants t1, t3, t5, t7, t9, respectively, the main switch S1 is opened during the off-time TOF and the output switch S2, is closed. During the on-time TON of the main switch S1, the current IL in the inductor L increases and energy is stored in the inductor L. During the on-time of the output switch S2, the current IL in the inductor L decreases and energy is supplied to the load 12.",
        "The duty cycle of a cycle CY is defined as the ratio of its on-time TON to the duration of the cycle CY. The DC-DC converter is regulated by selecting the duty cycle out of a first and a second duty cycle, the first duty cycle D1 is smaller than the second duty cycle D2. The first duty cycle D1 is also referred to as the minimum duty cycle, and the second duty cycle D2 is further referred to as the maximum duty cycle.",
        "The arrows at the instants t2, t4, t6, t8, t10 indicate sample instants at which the comparator 9 compares the output voltage Vout with the reference voltage VR. If the output voltage Vout is higher than the reference voltage VR, a succeeding cycle CY will have the minimum duty cycle D1. If the output voltage Vout is lower than the reference voltage VR, a succeeding cycle will have the maximum duty cycle D2.",
        "It is assumed that the value of the capacitor C is sufficiently large to keep the average level of the output voltage Vout substantially constant. At the instant t2, the main switch S1 is closed and the output switch S2 is opened, and consequently, the load 12 will draw a discharge current through the capacitor C which causes a downward jump in the voltage at the output due to the ESR. The ESR is the series impedance of the capacitor C. The linear decrease of the output voltage Vout from the instant t2 to t3 is due to the load discharging the output capacitor. At the instant t3, the main switch S1 is opened and the output switch S2 is closed: a charge current will flow into the capacitor C. Due to the ESR of the capacitor C, the polarity change of the current will cause an upward jump in the output voltage Vout. The decrease of the output voltage Vout from the instant t3 to t4 is due to the coil current decrease, resulting in an ESR voltage drop decrease. The comparator 9 compares the output voltage Vout with the reference level VR at, or just before the instant t4.

This causes a minimal further increase of an output voltage V1, V2, V3 which has a value already higher than its reference value VR1, VR2, VR3.

Usually, the first cycle CY1 in a sequence starts with the lowest average value of the current IL in the inductor L. This is due to the fact that cycles CY1, CY2, CY3 with the minimum duty cycle D1 occur at the end of the sequence SE. This lowest amount of energy should be supplied to an output O1, O2, O3 which is going to receive a much larger amount of energy than required. This is particularly true for an output O1, O2, O3 that already has a voltage V1, V2, V3 above its reference value VR1, VR2, VR3 and to which a minimum duty cycle D1 has to be allocated because there are no maximum duty cycles D2 left.",

Usually, in a sequence SE, the last cycle CY1, CY2, CY3 to which a maximum duty cycle D2 is allocated has the highest average value of the current IL in the inductor L. This is due to the fact that cycles CY1, CY2, CY3 with the minimum duty cycle D1 occur at the end of the sequence SE. This highest amount of energy should be supplied to an output O1, O2, O3 which is going to receive a much smaller amount of energy than required.

        "The allocator 141 may, if in a preceding sequence SE, the minimum duty cycle D1 is allocated to a particular one of the output voltages V1, V2, V3 while the associated reference voltage VR1, VR2, VR3 is lower, allocate in a next sequence SE the maximum duty cycle D2 to this particular one of the output voltages V1, V2, V3. Or, similarly, the allocator 114 may, if in a preceding sequence SE the maximum duty cycle D2 is allocated to a particular one of the output voltages V1, V2, V3 while the associated reference voltage VR1, VR2, VR3 is higher, allocate in a next sequence SE the minimum duty cycle D1 to this particular one of the output voltages V1, V2, V3.

Consequently, in the next sequence SE from instant t15 to instant t21, two of the cycles CY1, CY2, CY3 will have the maximum duty cycle D2, and one of the cycles CY1, CY2, CY3 will have the minimum duty cycle D1.",
        "The allocation of the one minimum duty cycle D1 and the two maximum duty cycles D2 in the sequence SE may be performed in several ways. Preferably, first, it is tried to allocate minimum duty cycles D1 to cycles CY1, CY2, CY3 in which the output voltage V1, V2, V3 is below the associated reference voltage VR1, VR2, VR3, and to allocate maximum duty cycles D2 to cycles CY1, CY2, CY3 in which the output voltage V1, V2, V3 is above the associated reference voltage VR1, VR2, VR3. Therefore, if available, a maximum duty cycle D2 has to be allocated to the third switch S3 because the third output voltage V3 is higher than its reference level VR3, and a minimum duty cycle D1 has to be allocated to the first and second switch S1 and S2.",
        "However, in the embodiment in accordance with the invention as shown in FIG. 4D, to either the first V1 or the second V2 output voltage a maximum duty cycle D2 has to be allocated as there is only a single minimum duty cycle D1 to be allocated. Thus in the process of allocating the single minimum duty cycle D1 and the two maximum duty cycles D2 to the three available cycles CY1, CY2, CY3 in the sequence SE it has been decided to allocate one of the maximum duty cycles D2 to the third switch S3 (the third output voltage V3 has a value above its reference VR1). The other maximum duty cycle D2 and the single minimum duty cycle D1 are allocated to the switches S1 and S2. For one of the switches S1, S2 this is correct because a minimum duty cycle D1 should be allocated to output voltages V1 and V2 which have a value below their reference values VR1 and VR2. For the other one of the switches S1, S2 this is incorrect.",
        "It is advantageous to select the allocation in time of the duty cycles in the order: first the two maximum duty cycles D2 and then the minimum duty cycle D1. In this manner, first the average current IL through the inductor L increases preventing the current IL from crossing zero during the cycle in which the minimum duty cycle D1 occurs.",
        "In a next step, it has to be selected in what order the power has to be delivered to the outputs O1, O2, O3. It is clear that the switch S3 should be operated with the maximum duty cycle D2, and thus should be associated with the first or the second cycle CY1 or CY2. As the third output voltage V3 has already a value above its reference value VR3 it is advantageous to supply as little as possible power to the third output O3. Consequently, this third switch S3 should be associated with the first cycle CY1 because the average current IL in the inductor L is minimal. The association of the first and the second switch S1, S2 to the second and third cycle S2, S3 is not important, one of the switches S2, S3 will be controlled correctly, the other will not. Preferably, if possible, in a next sequence SE, the allocation to the switches S2 and S3 is reversed to obtain an averaging effect.",

This means that if the output voltage V1, V2 is below its reference value VR1, VR2, the next switch cycle CY should have the maximum duty cycle, and when the output voltage V1, V2 is above its reference value VR1, VR2, the next switch cycle CY should be the minimum duty cycle D1.

And, the inductor current IL has to remain at the same level when one of the output voltages O1, O2 has a value above its associated reference level VR1, VR2, and one of the output voltages O1, O2 has a value below its associated reference level VR1, VR2. This results in a sequence SE of two maximum cycles D2 when the inductor current IL should increase, two minimum cycles D1 when the inductor current IL has to decrease, and one minimum D1 and one maximum D2 duty cycle when the inductor current IL must remain at the same level.",
        "Thus, when both outputs O1, O2 have a voltage V1, V2 above their reference level VR1, VR2, they will both get a minimum duty cycle D1.

When one of the outputs O1, O2 is above its reference level VR1, VR2, and one O1, O2 below its reference level VR1, VR2, the situation is different. Since the maximum duty cycle D2 has a short second phase (during which the switch S1, S2 arranged between the inductor and the load L1, L2 is closed) the energy transfer to the output O1, O2 is smaller than during the minimum duty cycle D1 which has a longer second phase. This means that the output O1, O2 with an output voltage V1, V2 above its reference level VR1, VR2 will get a maximum duty cycle D2 and the output O1, O2 with an output voltage V1, V2 below its reference level VR1, VR2 will get a minimum duty cycle D1.

This means that if the output voltage V1, V2 is below its reference level VR1, VR2, the next switch cycle CY should have a maximum duty cycle D2, and when the output voltage V1, V2 is above its reference level VR1, VR2, the next switch cycle CY should have a minimum duty cycle D1. Only the output O1, O2 with load current will get a switching cycle CY and output power. The other output O1, O2 stays at a level above its reference level VR1, VR2 and gets no switching cycles CY. The next table lists the control rules for one active output.",

        "For two outputs O1, O2 with load current the inductor current IL has to be adapted correctly and the power has to be distributed according to the need at the output O1, O2. The main difference with up-conversion is that energy is transferred during the complete switching cycle CY. Consequently, the amount of energy transferred does not depend on the duty cycle, thus, the choice of the minimum D1 and the maximum D2 duty cycle is less critical. The table below shows the control rules for two active outputs, always two cycles CY occur during a sequence SE.",

        "The conclusion for down-conversion is that at least the same rules are valid as for up-conversion.

        "FIG. 5 shows a block diagram of an apparatus with a DC-DC converter in accordance with the invention. The DC-DC converter in accordance with the invention, which is denoted by 100, receives an input voltage Vin and supplies a first output voltage V1 to a first circuit 101, a second output voltage V2 to a second circuit 102, and a third output voltage V3 to a third circuit 103. The first, second and third circuits 101, 102, 103 may be internal circuits (for example a receiver, a transmitter and a display in a mobile phone, or signal processing circuits and a display in a television or computer display) in an audio-visual application or may be external apparatuses.",
        "FIG. 6 shows a state diagram for elucidating the modes of output voltages. For the control of the converter, it is not required to measure whether an output Oi requires a load current or not. The mode of an output Oi is tracked with an algorithm elucidated with respect to the state diagram. The index i is an integer which indicates one of a plurality of outputs, depending on how many output Oi the converter has.",
        "The modes are defined as follows:",
        "mode 0: the output voltage Vi is larger than its reference voltage VRi, no power required, the output Oi is not active,",
        "mode 1: the output voltage Vi is larger than its reference voltage VRi, minimum power required, the output Oi is active,",
        "mode 2: the output voltage Vi is smaller than its reference voltage VRi, maximum power required, the output Oi is active,",
        "The value of the mode is determined by the previous mode and the new sampled output voltage Vi. If the sampled output voltage Vi is smaller than its reference value VRi, always mode 2 will be reached. If the sampled output voltage Vi is larger than its reference value VRi, mode 2 changes into mode 1, and mode 1 changes into mode 0. If the output voltage Vi is larger than its reference value VRi, the mode 1 will become mode 0 and mode 0 will stay mode 0 and the output Oi is not active. Thus, in active operation, for each output Oi, the mode will alternate between mode 1 and mode 2 in a sequence that depends on the measured value of the output voltage Vi. If one of the outputs Oi has zero load its output voltage Vi will remain above its reference level VRi which results in mode 0.",

        "In step 100 the values of the output voltages V1 and V2 are measured.",

If they are, in step 102, both the mode of output O1 (at which the voltage V1 is present) and output O2 (at which the voltage V2 is present) will change into mode 2, if the mode was 2 it will stay 2. And in step 103, in a sequence SE of cycles CY, the first maximum duty cycle D2 is applied to the first switch S1 associated with the first output voltage V1, and then the second maximum duty cycle D2 is applied to the second switch S2 associated with the second output voltage V2, or the other way around.",

If it is, in step 106, the mode of output 1 will be changed into mode 0, and the mode of output 2 will become mode 2, and only a maximum duty cycle D2 will be applied to the switch S2. No switching cycle will be allocated to the switch S1. If the mode of output O1 is not lower than 2, in step 108, the mode of output O1 will become 1, and the mode of output 2 will be 2, and first a maximum duty cycle D2 will be applied to the first switch S1, and then a minimum duty cycle D1 will be applied to the second switch S2.",

        "If step 116 is reached, the value of the output voltage V1 will be larger than its reference value VR1 and the value of the output voltage V2 will be larger than its reference value VR2. In step 117 is detected whether both the mode of the first output O1 and of the second output O2 is lower than mode 2. If it is, in step 119, the mode of outputs O1 and O2 will become mode 0, and in step 119 a wait cycle will be started until at least one of the output voltages V1, V2 drops below its reference value VR1, VR2. If not then step 120 will be performed.",
        "In step 120 there is checked whether the output O1 has a mode smaller than mode 2, if it has, in step 121, the mode of output O1 will be made mode 0, and the mode of output O2 will be made mode 1, and in step 122 the sequence SE will contain a single minimal duty cycle D1 applied to the switch S2.
