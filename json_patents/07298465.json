    "abstract": "Temporal phase shifts induced by cross-phase modulation in an optical fiber are directly characterized with a spectral equivalent of the Foucault technique used to spatially resolve wavefronts. The temporal phase induced by a high power pulsed pump on a monochromatic probe via cross-phase modulation is converted in a temporal intensity modulation via spectral filtering. A measurement of the modulated instantaneous power of the filtered signal allows to directly determine the time-resolved nonlinear phase shift. Additionally, an equivalent of the transport-of-intensity equation, which links the evolution of the instantaneous power of the electric field in a dispersive medium to the instantaneous values of the power and phase of the field. This derivation permits the measurement of temporal phase shifts using only intensity information in a direct, non-interferometric manner.",

        "As is known and recognized, nonlinear interactions such as cross-phase modulation (XPM) and self-phase modulation (SPM) directly modify the temporal phase of an optical field. As a result, long-haul optical transmission\u2014where optical pulses are transmitted over long lengths of optical fibers\u2014is impaired. The induced temporal phase shifts can also be used in applications such as pulse compression, regeneration, performance monitoring and photonic logic.",

Unfortunately, while the intensity of an optical wave may be obtained directly\u2014using common square-law detectors\u2014the phase of the optical wave can only be measured indirectly, as direct detectors are insensitive to optical phase.",

The filter in the Fourier conjugate domain converts the spatial phase modulation of the input beam into a spatial intensity modulation on the output beam, and the measured modulated intensity is then used to determine the spatial phase.",

One filters the phase modulated source in the spectral domain and then measures the temporal intensity of the filtered source. Advantageously, and in sharp contrast to other approaches, my technique can unambiguously determine temporal phase shifts induced by a pump of arbitrary shape by just performing temporal intensity measurements.",

        "While my technique can, in principle, be applied with a wide variety of filters as long as their transfer function is known in amplitude and phase, a simple choice is a filter that is blocks the transmission of light for optical frequencies lower than a given frequency \u03c90 and exhibits constant transmission for frequencies higher than \u03c90. Such a filter therefore, mimics a Heaviside function. With such a filter (known as the Foucault filter in the wavefront measurement community), the function p\u03c4 is the Hilbert transform of the function p (See, for example, A. Sagan, S. Nowicki, R. Buczynski, M. Kowalczyk, and T. Szoplik, \u201cImaging Phase Objects With Square-Root, Foucault and Hoffman Real Filters: A Comparision\u201d, Appl. Opt., 42, 5816-5824 (2003)).",

The temporal phase shift(s) so induced are determined through spectral filtering 130 and the measurement of the resulting intensity 140. the carrier, and blocks the spectral modes having a wavelength lower than that of the carrier With simultaneous reference to FIG. 2B, the optical spectrum of the modulated probe is shown before and after the spectral filter\u2014the latter being shifted down in the FIG. 2B for clarity.

        "The attenuation of the carrier as compared to that of the other spectral modes (the value of |\u03c4(0)| for the right-hand-side of Eq. 1) was measured precisely using the optical spectra measured before and after the interleaver 240. The correlation between the calculated Hilbert transform of the measured pump instantaneous power and the measured modulated probe is determined using a linear fit, following Eq. 1, which leads to the value of \u03b1\u00b7\u0393. Two examples of such fit obtained for a peak phase shift of 77 mrad and 3.9 mrad are plotted in FIG. 3(a) and FIG. 3(b), respectively.",
        "The accuracy and sensitivity of my technique were determined by measuring the nonlinear coefficient of the fiber when maximizing the nonlinear phase shift (i.e. when the pump 210 and probe 220 are launched in the fiber under test 230 with identical polarization states, which leads to \u03b1=2). The peak power was varied, thereby generating phase shifts ranging from 3.9 mrad to 77 mrad and the wavelength of the pump 210 was maintained at 1556 nm.",
        "We can more completely describe our technique with reference to the experimental setup shown in FIG. 2. More specifically, a pump source is generated by sending monochromatic laser light emitted from monochromatic laser 210 into an electroabsorption modulator (EAM) 212 properly biased and driven by a 10 GHz sinewave. This pulsed, monochromatic source is amplified by EDFA 214 and filtered by filter 216. As can be seen in this FIG. 2, the instantaneous power p(t) of the pulsed source in a 100 ps window is shown in inset, 218.",
        "The pulsed source is coupled with a monochromatic probe set at 1560.7 nm, output from monochromatic laser #2 220, and the combined sources are sent into a fiber under test 230 and subsequently into the interleaver 240.",
        "The output of the interleaver 240 was filtered using a bandpasss filter 250, amplified in an erbium-doped fiber amplifier 260 and subsequently detected using a 30 GHz sampling oscilloscope 270. Advantageously, in this experimental setup, the same sampling oscilloscope 270 was also used to measure the instantaneous power of the pump p(t). The average power of the pump P was measured using a powermeter (not specifically shown).",
        "The wavelength of the monochromatic probe was set such that the interleaver 240 provides a substantially constant transmission for the spectral modes of the phase modulated source having a wavelength higher than that of",
        "The determined value of \u0393 is plotted in FIG. 4 and shows the consistency of the measurement, even when the phase shift is in the 1 milliradian range. The average value of \u0393 over this range is 5.62 W\u22121, with a standard deviation of 0.04 W\u22121. This value is in good agreement with the values previously determined on the same fiber with two other techniques (See, e.g., C. Dorrer, \u201cDirect Measurement of the Nonlinear Coefficient Of An Optical Fiber Using Linear Optical Sampling, Electron. Lett., 41, pp. 8-10, 2005), noting that this determination is, as in all other techniques, sensitive to the knowledge of the actual power coupled in the fiber.",
        "The nonlinear coefficient of the fiber was also measured when minimizing the nonlinear phase shift, which happens in a fiber with random birefringence when the pump and probe are launched with orthogonal polarization states. This leads to the value \u03b1=1, and the XPM-induced phase shift is half the phase shift obtained when the two sources are identically polarized (it should be noted that in such fiber, all determinations of the nonlinear coefficient already includes the normalization factor equal to 8/9) (See, e.g., S. V. Chernikov and J. R. Taylor, \u201cMeasurement Of The Normalization Factor Of n2 For Random Polarization In Optical Fibers\u201d, Opt. Lett., 21, pp. 1559-1561, 1996).",
        "Experimentally, the ratio of the maximal phase shift to the minimal phase shift was measured as 1.97 when the pump and probe are maintained at 1556 nm and 1560.7 nm respectively, but was found to decrease slowly with the wavelength separation of the two sources, reaching the value of 1.87 when the pump and probe are at 1535 nm and 1560.7 nm, respectively. This may be attributed to the increased decorrelation of the polarization states of the two sources induced by the polarization-mode dispersion of the fiber under test. For completely decorrelated polarization states, the phase shift would not depend on the polarization states of the two sources, which would lead to a value of 1 for the ratio of the maximum to the minimum phase shift.",
        "As can be appreciated, my inventive technique allows the unambiguous determination of the nonlinear phase shift induced by a cross-phase modulation of a monochromatic source by a pump pulse. Advantageously, my technique is extremely sensitive, being able to detect phase shifts on the order of 1 milliradian.",
        "In addition, I have developed additional inventive techniques for measuring temporal phase shifts using only intensity information in a direct, non-interferometric manner. More particularly, I have derived\u2014in the temporal domain\u2014an equivalent of the transport-of-intensity equation, therefore describing the evolution of the instantaneous power of the electric field in a dispersive medium. As its spatial counterpart, which can be used to measure wavefronts using intensity measurements after various amounts of diffraction, the temporal transport-of-intensity equation so derived allows the measurement of temporal phase shifts using only intensity information in a direct non-interferometric way. Advantageously, my inventive technique may be applied to the measurement of nonlinear phase shifts induced by self-phase modulation and cross-phase modulation, and the nonlinear coefficient of a highly nonlinear fiber may be accurately determined as well.",
        "To fully understand this additional technique, and with reference to FIG. 5(a), a concise derivation of the transport-of-intensity equation in one dimension may be obtained using Wigner functions, with the notations shown in that FIG. 5(a). The Wigner function of the temporal electric field is by definition",

Alferness, \u201cPhase Modulation To Amplitude Modulation Conversion of CW Laser Light in Optical Fibres\u201d, Electron. Lett., 22, pp. 409-411, 1986) is the basis of some chromatic dispersion and zero-dispersion wavelength measurement schemes, but it is usually treated by considering harmonics of the phase modulation, which makes it cumbersome to apply when the phase modulation is not sinusoidal. And while other applications of my inventive techniques involving the temporal TIE could be discussed, we focus herein on the detection of temporal phase shifts induced by self-phase modulation (SPM) or cross phase modulation (XPM).",

After such propagation, the field around the optical frequency of the monochromatic laser has power P0 and phase \u03b1\u00b7\u0393\u00b7P\u00b7p(t), the latter being the phase shift induced by the pump (\u03b1 depends upon the relative polarization states of the two sources).

For a given fiber, the determination of the nonlinear coefficient was consistent for powers ranging from 5.7 dBm to \u22124.3 dBm, i.e. down to milliradian phase shifts, with standard deviation smaller than 0.1. The value of the nonlinear coefficient compares well with the previously determined values of 5.92 W\u22121 and 6.09 W\u22121 using two other techniques (See., e.g, C. Dorrer, \u201cDirect Measurement of the Nonlinear Coefficient of An Optical Fiber Using Linear Optical Sampling\u201d, Electron. Lett., 41, pp. 8-10, 2005. The lower values obtained with these XPM-based measurements can be explained by a lower value of \u03b1 due to the decorrelation of the polarization states of the two sources because of polarization-mode dispersion in the fiber. As in all other techniques, the accuracy of the determination of the nonlinear coefficient is also linked to the accuracy of the knowledge of the power launched into the fiber, and the different determinations could also be explained by a 0.3 dB uncertainty in the determination of such power.",

It therefore appears that the response of the detection system should not impair the XPM measurements, but can affect the accuracy of the SPM measurements. The values of \u0393 obtained in the SPM measurements using the previously mentioned value of P2\u2212P1 are respectively 6.13 W\u22121, 5.48 W\u22121 and 6.04 W\u22121 when respectively using the DCF, SSMF and the combination of DCF and SSMF.",
        "As can now be appreciated, with this derivation of a temporal transport-of-intensity equation linking the changes in the instantaneous power of the electric field due to chromatic dispersion to the instantaneous values of the power and phase of the field has been derived. An application to the measurement of nonlinear phase shifts induced by XPM and SPM with sensitivity better than 1 milliradian has been presented.",
        "With these discussions in place, and with reference now to FIG. 10, there is shown a flowchart that generally depicts my inventive method(s). More specifically, and as described in detail earlier, a temporal phase is first introduced into an optical signal (block 910). This optical signal is then converted from a phase modulation into an intensity modulation (block 920) and the resulting intensity modulated signal is measured (block 930). From these intensity measurement(s), the phase modulation is determined (block 940).",
