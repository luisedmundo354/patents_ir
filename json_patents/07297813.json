    "description": [
        "The invention relates to alkanesulfonic acids. More particularly, it relates to methods of removing alkyl esters of these acids from compositions containing them, thereby purifying the compositions.",
        "Alkanesulfonic acids, particularly methanesulfonic acid (MSA), are typically prepared by reaction of a thiol or disulfide with a strong aqueous oxidant. A common oxidant for this chemistry is aqueous chlorine, with alternative oxidants including nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide/hydrogen halide. The alkanesulfonic acid products from these oxidation reactions are typically in an aqueous form. The purified commercial products are then sold as aqueous acids or anhydrous acids, the latter being typically obtained by distillation of the water from the sulfonic acid.",
        "Processes for the distillation of water from aqueous methanesulfonic acid to produce anhydrous sulfonic acids, particularly anhydrous methanesulfonic acid, require high temperatures (120-190\u00b0 C.) and reduced pressures (5-66 mbar) to effect the removal of the water and to obtain an anhydrous product. At these elevated temperatures, anhydrous or near-anhydrous alkanesulfonic acids are known to decompose to form alkyl alkanesulfonate esters, presumably via formation of the sulfonyl anhydride and subsequent decomposition to the alkyl alkanesulfonate ester and SO2. In the case of methanesulfonic acid, the adventitiously formed methyl methanesulfonate is known to possess toxic or mutagenic properties, and its presence is therefore undesirable. Other alkyl esters of methanesulfonic acid have also been shown to exhibit high toxicity and mutagenic properties.",
        "Alkanesulfonic acids are commonly used as catalysts for the esterification of weaker acids with alkanols, and in the preparation of ethers from alkanols. These reactions are normally driven to completion by removal of the water of condensation using distillation or liquid/liquid phase separation. In these reactions, esterification of the sulfonic acid catalyst can occur and thereby consume some of the sulfonic acid, which could otherwise be recycled for further use as a catalyst. Thus in such systems, as well as in the manufacture of alkanesulfonic acids, it would be desirable to provide ways of converting such sulfonate esters back to the acids, or to permit their facile removal.",
        "The invention provides a method of removing alkyl alkanesulfonates RSO2OR\u2032 from a composition. The method includes contacting the composition with a reagent selected to convert the R\u2032 moiety or the OR\u2032 moiety of the RSO2OR\u2032 to one or more products selected from the group consisting of R\u2032X, R\u2032SO3H, R\u2032SO3Mn, R\u2032SO33 R\u2033R\u2032\u2033R\u2033\u2033NH+, R\u2032SO3R\u2033, R\u2033-ZOR\u2032, (HO)2PO(OR\u2032), HOPO(OR\u2032)2 (R\u2032O)3PO, (MnO)2PO(OR\u2032), MnOPO(OR\u2032)2, HO3S\u2014R\u2033-ZOR\u2032, MnO3S\u2014R\u2033-ZOR\u2032, MnO3S\u2014R\u2033(ZOMn)-ZOR\u2032, oxidized carbon species, and water, thereby converting the RSO2OR\u2032 to RSO3H. R and R\u2032 are each independently a C1-C20 alkyl, aralkyl or alkenyl group, or any of these incorporating a substituent selected from the group consisting of halogens and functional groups comprising oxygen, sulfur, silicon, tin, phosphorous, or nitrogen. R\u2033, R\u2032\u2033 and R\u2033\u2033 are independently a polymeric group or a C1-C20 alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or alkenyl group, or any of these incorporating a substituent selected form the group consisting of halogens and functional groups comprising oxygen, sulfur, silicon, tin, phosphorous, or nitrogen. M is a metal selected from the group consisting of Group I metals, Group II metals, transition metals, Al, Sn, Sb, Pb, and Bi, provided that M is a Group I or Group II metal when the product is (MnO)2PO(OR\u2032), MnOPO(OR\u2032)2 or MnO3S\u2014R\u2033(ZOMn)-ZOR\u2032, and n is equal to the reciprocal of the oxidation state of the metal. Z is CO, P(O)OH, P(O)OR\u2032 or S(O), and X is halogen.",
        "The invention provides methods for the conversion of alkyl alkanesulfonate esters of the formula RSO3R\u2032 to the corresponding acids of the formula RSO3H. The sulfonate esters are present in an organic medium, which may contain significant amounts of water or which may be anhydrous or substantially anhydrous. As used herein, unless otherwise specified, \u201csubstantially anhydrous\u201d means containing at most 5 wt % water, and \u201canhydrous\u201d means containing at most 1 wt % water. In some embodiments, the organic medium may be the acid RSO3H, or a mixture of the acid with water, in which RSO3R\u2032 is present as an impurity. In this case, the removal of the RSO3R\u2032 may be considered a purification of RSO3H. Alkyl alkanesulfonate esters suitable for conversion to the corresponding acids include compounds RSO3R\u2032 wherein R and R\u2032 independently represent C1-C20 alkyl, arylalkyl, or alkenyl groups, optionally substituted with halogen (F, Cl, Br, I), oxygen, sulfur-, silicon, tin, phosphorous, or nitrogen. Typically the functional groups, if present, are halogen, ether, ester, sulfide, carboxamide, or sulfonamide groups.",
        "The alkyl alkanesulfonate esters can be substantially or completely removed from the organic medium by any of several methods, including:",
        "(a.) Treatment of aqueous alkanesulfonic acids containing alkanesulfonate esters with anhydrous or aqueous hydrogen halide.",
        "(b.) Treatment of anhydrous or substantially anhydrous alkanesulfonic acids containing alkyl alkanesulfonates with anhydrous or substantially anhydrous hydrogen halides.",
        "(c.) Treatment of aqueous alkanesulfonic acids containing alkyl alkanesulfonates with strong oxidants such as nitric acid, nitric oxide/dinitrogen tetroxide, hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, aqueous halogen, or ozone.",
        "(d.) Treatment of anhydrous or substantially anhydrous alkanesulfonic acids containing alkyl alkanesulfonates with strong oxidants such as aqueous 70-90% nitric acid, anhydrous nitric oxide/dinitrogen tetroxide, organic peroxides, hydrogen peroxide, or ozone.",
        "(e.) Treatment of aqueous alkanesulfonic acid containing alkyl alkanesulfonate esters with reactive forms of SO2.",
        "(f.) Treatment of aqueous alkanesulfonic acid containing alkyl alkanesulfonate esters with weaker acids, or salts thereof.",
        "(g.) Treatment of aqueous alkanesulfonic acid containing alkyl alkanesulfonate esters with materials possessing both sulfonic acid and weaker-acid functionality, or salts thereof.",
        "Compositions containing any amount of alkyl alkanesulfonate may be treated by the methods of this invention, resulting in very low levels of those materials after treatment. Typically the concentration of the alkyl alkanesulfonate prior to treatment will be between about 1% and 5 ppm by weight in the composition, more typically between about 500 and 5 ppm. After treatment, the compositions typically contain less than 1 ppm of these compounds. Each of the above-outlined methods will now be discussed in detail.",
        "(a.) Treatment of compositions containing alkanesulfonate esters with anhydrous or aqueous hydrogen halide is one method of removing the esters. One useful example is removal of these materials from aqueous alkanesulfonic acids. Typical conditions for treating an alkanesulfonic acid containing an alkanesulfonate ester RSO3R\u2032 as an impurity include contacting the mixture with anhydrous or aqueous hydrogen halides at temperatures of 50\u00b0 C. for a minimum of eight hours, or for two or more hours at a temperature of 70\u00b0 C., under conditions where sufficient agitation is present to permit intimate contact of the hydrogen halide and the dissolved sulfonate ester. The reaction chemistry can be illustrated as follows:\n\nRSO3R\u2032+HX\u2192RSO3H+R\u2032X\n\nwith X representing F, Cl, Br, or I, and R and R\u2032 as previously defined herein.",
        "In that the rate of reaction of the sulfonate ester is temperature dependent, and given the preferred treatment times and temperatures cited above, alternate heating times, temperatures, and mixing conditions can be readily inferred by those skilled in the art in order to achieve sufficient conversion of the sulfonate ester to the acid.",
        "One exemplary embodiment of the method is the removal of methyl or ethyl methanesulfonate impurities in methanesulfonic acid with hydrogen chloride or hydrochloric acid, affording methyl or ethyl chlorides as the reaction products. These alkyl chloride products are gases at most convenient reaction temperatures and thus are easily separated from the methanesulfonic acid, thereby affording a sulfonic acid that is substantially free of the ethyl or methyl methanesulfonate impurities.",
        "The treatment is typically carried out at a temperature less than the boiling point of a water-HCl azeotrope, that temperature being about 108\u00b0 C. at atmospheric pressure. Above the azeotrope temperature, HCl tends to be removed from the reaction mixture by boiling, and it is generally desirable to avoid this situation in order to avoid HCl losses. Higher temperatures may be suitable, however, if pressures greater than atmospheric are used, thereby increasing the boiling point.",
        "The mode of addition of the hydrogen halide may include, but is not limited to, simple stirring of the alkanesulfonic acid containing the sulfonate ester impurities with aqueous hydrogen halide, bubbling anhydrous hydrogen halide gas through the alkanesulfonic acid, or saturating the alkanesulfonic acid with the hydrogen halide at pressures greater than 1 atmosphere. While the molar charge of hydrogen halide may be varied over a considerable range, the most economical amount is typically 1 to 10 molar equivalents relative to the amount of sulfonate ester impurity in the alkanesulfonic acid, preferably 1-3 times. Several methods of removing the volatile organic products of the reaction can be readily envisioned by those skilled in the art, thereby affording the sulfonic acid in a form that is substantially free of the sulfonate ester impurity. These include, but are not limited to, heating the reaction mixture under reduced pressure, or contacting the treated alkanesulfonic acid with air, nitrogen, or other gases to entrain the alkyl halide into the gas phase.",
        "(b.) Anhydrous or substantially anhydrous compositions containing alkanesulfonate esters may be treated with anhydrous or substantially anhydrous hydrogen halides to remove the esters. One useful example is removal of these materials from anhydrous or substantially anhydrous alkanesulfonic acids. In general, the procedures, conditions, and explanations given under (a.) above are applicable to the treatment of anhydrous compositions. An especially useful embodiment involves the reaction of methyl or ethyl methanesulfonate impurities in anhydrous or substantially anhydrous methanesulfonic acid with hydrogen chloride, affording methyl or ethyl chlorides as gaseous reaction products that are readily separated from the methanesulfonic acid. These alkyl chloride products are gases at the reaction temperature and thus easily separated, thus affording a methanesulfonic acid that is substantially free of the methyl or ethyl methanesulfonate impurities.",
        "The temperature for this treatment is typically greater than 50\u00b0 C., more typically greater than 70\u00b0 C. and usually less than 170\u00b0 C. In that the amount of water present is minimal, the loss of the hydrogen halide via azeotropic distillation is minimized, thus allowing the use of higher temperatures than when significant amounts of water are present. However, at temperatures significantly exceeding this range, alkyl alkanesulfonate esters (e.g. methyl methanesulfonate) typically begin to form by thermal decomposition processes. It should be noted that the removal of alkyl alkanesulfonate esters from alkanesulfonic acids using HCl or other hydrogen halides offers certain advantages over attempts to remove them by hydrolysis of the ester. In the former reaction, the alkyl chloride/halide product is low boiling and reasonably inert to acid media as well as to strong oxidizing agents such as O2, H2O2, HNO3 or the various nitrogen oxides that might be present in the acid as impurities. In contrast, hydrolysis results in formation of alcohols and/or ethers (e.g. methanol and dimethyl ether), both of which are much more reactive to strong oxidizing agents and thus may be converted to more difficult-to-remove impurities.",
        "(c.) Strong oxidants such as nitric acid, nitric oxide/dinitrogen tetroxide, hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, aqueous halogen, and ozone may also be used to remove alkyl alkanesulfonates from aqueous compositions. One useful example is removal of these materials from aqueous alkanesulfonic acids. Using methods similar to those of (a.) and (b.), the alkanesulfonic acid containing sulfonate ester impurities is treated with a strong oxidizing agent such that the sulfonate ester is converted to the corresponding sulfonic acid and oxidized carbon species such as CO, CO2, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, or other oxygen-containing species derived from the R\u2032 moiety. One especially useful treatment involves the reaction of alkyl alkanesulfonate impurities in aqueous alkanesulfonic acid, particularly methyl, ethyl, and propyl esters in aqueous methane-, ethane- or propanesulfonic acids, with nitric acid or nitric oxide/dinitrogen tetroxide mixtures, affording alkanesulfonic acid, oxidized carbon species, NO, and N2O, along with smaller amounts of nitroalkane R\u2032NO2. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory or explanation, it is believed that the reaction chemistries can be illustrated at least approximately as follows:\n\n2HNO3\u2192H2O2+2NO2 \n\nRSO3R\u2032+2HNO3\u2192RSO3H+CO2+2H2O+2 NO\n\nRSO3R\u2032+3NO2\u2192RSO3H+CO2+H2O+3NO\n\nRSO3R\u2032+3H2O2\u2192R\u2032SO3H+CO2+4H2O",
        "The above equations are balanced in the exemplary case where R\u2032=methyl, but it will be understood that analogous equations may be written for any R\u2032.

The mode of addition of the nitrogenous oxidant may include, but is not limited to, simple stirring of the alkanesulfonic acid containing the sulfonate ester impurities with aqueous concentrated nitric acid, or bubbling anhydrous nitric oxide/dinitrogen tetroxide gas through the alkanesulfonic acid. The molar charge of the oxidant is typically 2 to 10 molar equivalents relative to the amount of sulfonate ester impurity in the alkanesulfonic acid, preferably 2-6 times. Several methods to remove the volatile organic and inorganic products of the reaction can be readily envisioned by those skilled in the art, thereby affording the sulfonic acid in a form that is substantially free of the sulfonate ester impurity. These include, but are not limited to, heating under reduced pressure, or contacting to the treated alkanesulfonic acid with air, nitrogen, or other gases.",

        "(d.) Anhydrous or substantially anhydrous compositions containing alkyl alkanesulfonates may also be treated with strong oxidants such as aqueous 70-90% nitric acid, anhydrous nitric oxide/dinitrogen tetroxide, organic peroxides, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone to remove the alkanesulfonates. One useful example is removal of these materials from anhydrous or substantially anhydrous alkanesulfonic acids. In general, the procedures, conditions, and explanations given under (c.) above are applicable to the treatment of anhydrous compositions. One especially useful treatment involves the reaction of alkyl alkanesulfonate impurities in anhydrous or substantially anhydrous alkanesulfonic acid, particularly methyl, ethyl, and propyl esters in methane-, ethane- or propanesulfonic acids, with nitric acid or nitric oxide/dinitrogen tetroxide mixtures, affording alkanesulfonic acid, oxidized carbon species, NO, and N2O, along with smaller amounts of nitroalkane R\u2032NO2. The reaction chemistries are as described under (c.) above. Since the amount of nitrogenous oxidant would be small relative to the amount of material being treated, 70-90% nitric acid is considered to be substantially anhydrous for the purposes of this invention. As noted above under (c.), the use of other strong oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide or ozone may also be suitable according to the present invention.",
        "(e.) Treatment of aqueous mixtures containing alkyl alkanesulfonate esters may also be performed with reactive forms of SO2, resulting in removal of the alkanesulfonate esters. One useful example is removal of these materials from aqueous alkanesulfonic acids. According to this embodiment of the invention, the R\u2032 portion (i.e. the alcohol-derived portion) of the alkyl alkanesulfonate is converted to an alkanesulfonic acid or salt. The reactive forms of SO2 may include (i) gaseous SO2, (ii) aqueous sulfurous acid, (iii) metal salts of sulfurous acid (H2SO3), (iv) amine salts of H2SO3, (v) alkyl sulfites, or (vi-ix) complexes of SO2 with highly polar materials such as amines, carboxamides, sulfonamides, sulfones or sulfoxides.

        "As can be seen by reviewing the above data, reaction of the sulfonate esters derived from catalytic sulfonic acids used in typical esterifications is slower when using water as the treatment medium. The rate was accelerated on addition of alkaline base. Moreover, reaction rates for methyl and butyl methanesulfonates are faster than those for the corresponding toluenesulfonates, while those for the methyl methanesulfonates or toluenesulfonates were generally much faster than those for the corresponding butyl esters. As similarly proposed in Example 5 and without wishing to be bound by any particular theory or explanation, the acceleration is thought to arise from formation of the phthalate half ester/salt by reaction with the aqueous base with the dialkyl phthalate. The thus formed phthalate half ester/salt would retain significant solubility in the dialkyl phthalate phase, wherein it would react with the sulfonate ester. The slower reaction rates for the methanesulfonates vs. the toluenesulfonates, and for the methyl sulfonates vs. the butyl sulfonates, is consistent with the reduced molecular-scale steric interactions that arise when a smaller sulfonate ester (e.g., methyl sulfonates vs. butyl sulfonates, or methanesulfonate esters vs. toluenesulfonate esters) must react with the bulky phthalate half ester/salts. The alternative mechanism would be direct reaction of the sulfonate esters with hydroxide. The observed reaction rates are less consistent with the results one would expect for reaction of a small, unhindered nucleophile such as hydroxide with the various sulfonate esters.",
