        "Various technologies have been proposed for projection and display systems such as those utilizing spatial light modulation employing various materials. Among these are silicon-based micromechanical spatial light modulation (SLM) devices in which a large portion of the device is optically active. In such systems, micromirrors may deflect in one or more directions. For instance, in architectures that rely on a passive drive scheme, a voltage bias is accomplished by an address electrode. Once the mirror rotates, the electrode floats and the mirror maintains its deflected position. As the bias is reset, the mirror rotates back to the flat state at a rate that is limited by the hinge spring constant of the micromirror device. The hinge spring constant typically results in a reset cycle that is slower than the drive cycle. This limits the ability of the micromirror device to twitch at high frequencies. Thus, it would be desirable to provide a micromirror architecture that could facilitate high reset frequencies, while providing high efficiency and operational integrity.",

Deflectable member assembly 610 is supported by semiconductor substrate 612. An address electrode 616 is also supported by semiconductor substrate 612. Optically transmissive substrate 614 is in spaced overlying relationship with the deflectable member assembly 610. Reset electrode 618 is supported by semiconductor substrate 612 in a manner such that ground electrode 608 (Vg) and reset electrode 618 are not limited to CMOS voltage constraints but rather are a part general offset voltage introduced to an entire array of micromirrors or other deflectable members. Thus, the voltage applied between ground electrode 608 (Vg) and reset electrode 618 (Vr) may be sufficiently high to enable a high speed mirror reset. It is contemplated that voltages may be as high as \u00b1100V or other values appropriate for the circuitry and configuration.",
        "In a representative operational sequence as depicted in FIGS. 6A, 6B, and 6C, initial voltage potentials for ground electrode 608, address electrode 616, and reset electrode 618 are those sufficient to maintain the mirror 600 in the rest or optically neutral position. As illustrated in FIG. 6A, voltage potentials for ground electrode 608 (Vg) address electrode 616 (Ve1) and reset electrode 618 (Vr) are all zero.",
        "In order to tilt the mirror 600 to an operative position as depicted in FIG. 6B, a bias voltage is applied to address electrode 616 (Ve1=+). During deflection it is contemplated that the voltage of the ground electrode 608 and reset electrode 618 may be biased to facilitate deflection to the operative position if desired or required. If desired, the electrostatic attractive force of the deflectable member assembly 610 may be enhanced by a suitable bias voltage through ground electrode 608 (Vg=\u2212).",
        "In order to reset the mirror 600 to the optically neutral position as depicted in FIG. 6C, the bias voltage to address electrode 616 may be discontinued (Ve1=0) and a bias voltage may be applied to the reset electrode 618 (Vr=+), while the bias voltage applied to the ground electrode 608 remains negative (Vg=\u2212). This negative bias voltage applied to the ground electrode 608 enhances electrostatic force of the deflectable member assembly 610. It is also contemplated that, in certain situations, the bias voltage applied to the ground electrode 608 may be neutral.",
        "Once the mirror 600 is returned to the optically neutral position, the bias voltage of reset electrode 618 may be discontinued (Vr=0) as depicted in FIG. 6D. Bias voltage of the ground electrode 608 can continue as depicted in FIG. 6D or be discontinued as required.",
        "The reset electrode as disclosed herein may be used with various microelectromechanical devices having deflectable member(s). The point of deflection may be a central point as discussed previously. It is also contemplated that the point of deflection may be offset depending on the design of the associated microelectromechanical device. For example, in micromirror assemblies the device may use a side hinge mount.",
        "A fourth alternate embodiment depicting a micromirror with a side hinge mount is illustrated in FIGS. 7A, 7B, and 7C. The micromirror is one element of a micromirror array and is depicted in cross-section at 90\u00b0 to the hinge axis. Mirror 700 is attached to support post 702 by means of a suitable torsion hinge (not shown). Support post 702 is in electrical communication with ground electrode 708 via upright 706 and lower support 704. Taken together, mirror 700, support post 702, upright 706, lower support 704, and hinge(s) (not shown) form deflectable member assembly 710. Deflectable member assembly 710 is supported by substrate 712. An address electrode 716 is also supported by substrate 712. Optically transmissive substrate 714 is in spaced overlying relationship to the deflectable member 710 and substrate 712. A reset electrode 718 is supported on the lower face 720 of the optically transmissive substrate 714. The reset electrode 718 may be made of an optically transparent material as discussed previously. Reset electrode 718 may have any suitable configuration covering all or a portion of the lower face 720 of the optically transparent substrate 714 as desired or required. In the reset or optically neutral position depicted in FIG. 7A, the voltage potential of address electrode 716 (Ve1), ground electrode 708 (Vg), and reset electrode 718 are all zero.",
        "In order to tilt or deflect mirror 700 into the operative position depicted in FIG. 7B a bias voltage is applied to address electrode 716 (Ve1=+). The applied bias voltage is one to produce an electrostatic force sufficient to deflect the mirror 700 and is maintained until a reset is required. In order to facilitate deflection, the electrostatic attractive force exerted on deflectable member assembly 710 can be enhanced by application of a bias voltage of the ground electrode 718 (Vg=\u2212).",
        "Reset to the rest or optically neutral position is depicted in FIG. 7C. In order to reset, a voltage potential can be established between the reset electrode 718 and the ground electrode 708. As depicted in FIG. 7C, reset electrode 718 is biased such that the bias voltage (Vr) is positive while the bias voltage of ground electrode 708 (Vg) remains negative with the absolute value being sufficient to return the micromirror 700 to the optically neutral or rest position. In order to further facilitate rapid reset, the voltage through the address electrode 716 may be reduced to zero (Ve1=0).",
        "It is also contemplated that the reset electrode disclosed herein may be employed in configurations in which a deflectable member is supported by the optically transmissive substrate. To further illustrate this, a fifth embodiment of a micromirror device is set forth in FIGS. 8A, 8B, and 8C. A deflectable member assembly 810 is supported on optically transparent substrate 814. The optically transparent substrate 814 is in overlying relationship with a suitable semiconductor substrate 812 having suitable CMOS architecture. The deflectable member assembly 810 may move from a rest position to at least one operative position in a region defined between the semiconductor substrate 812 and the optically transparent substrate 814.",
        "The deflectable member assembly 810 as depicted in FIGS. 8A, 8B and 8C includes a mirror 800 mounted on a support post 802 by means of a suitable torsion hinge (not shown). The deflectable member assembly 810 is in electrical contact with ground electrode 808. As depicted in FIGS. 8A, 8B, and 8C, ground electrode 808 is patterned on or integrated into the lower face 820 of the optically transmissive substrate 814. It is also contemplated that the ground electrode 808 could be mounted on the lower face 820 by any suitable method. A reset electrode 818 is also patterned on, integrated into, or mounted on the lower face 820 of the optically transmissive substrate 814. The reset electrode 818 is composed of optically transparent material. It is contemplated that the ground electrode 808 may be composed of any suitable material including, but not limited to, optically transmissive materials enumerated herein as would be applicable. The ground electrode 808 and reset electrode 818 function independently of one another and are both independent of the CMOS architecture found in the semiconductor substrate 812. Address electrode 816 is positioned in the semiconductor substrate 812. Typically the address electrode 816 functions within the CMOS architecture.",
        "The deflectable member assembly 810 with mirror 800 is in a rest or optically neutral position when the voltage biases between the reset electrode 818 and ground electrode 808 are canceled. Discontinuation of the bias voltage in reset electrode 818, together with introduction of a bias voltage sufficient to generate an electrostatic attractive force at address electrode 816 drives the deflectable member assembly 810 into a tilted or operative position as illustrated in FIG. 8B. Reset to the start position can be accomplished by discontinuation of the voltage bias of the address electrode 816 together with introduction of a voltage potential in the reset electrode 818. This state is illustrated in FIG. 8C.",
        "As depicted in FIG. 8A, in the rest or optically neutral state, the bias voltage of the reset electrode 818 (Vr=+) balances or cancels the bias voltage of ground electrode 808 (Vg=\u2212). The absolute value of the respective bias voltage may be any suitable value. Typically, the bias voltage absolute value of ground electrode 808 and reset electrode 818 will exceed the absolute value of the bias voltage of the address electrode 816. It is contemplated that the ground electrode 808 and reset electrode 818 achieve bias voltage values between \u2212100V and 100V.",
        "The deflectable member assembly 810 can remain in the operative position as long as desired or required. When reset to the rest or operatively neutral position is required, reset can be accomplished by discontinuation of the bias voltage of address electrode 816 (Ve1=0) and resumption of bias voltage for reset electrode 818 (Vr=+) as depicted in FIG. 8C.",
        "Location of the ground electrode 808, reset electrode 818 and associated deflectable member assembly 810 on the optically transparent substrate 814 permits standard CMOS processes (like SRAM) to be located on the semiconductor substrate 812 in the region below or covered by the deflectable member assembly 810. Integration of the microelectromechanical system such as the deflectable member assembly 810 on substrate 814 permits greater flexibility in the formation of CMOS architecture and location on semiconductor substrate 812.",
        "The microelectromechanical device with the reset electrode as disclosed herein may be used in a variety of applications. One nonlimiting example is in spatial light modulators. It is contemplated that a spatial light modulator can include a plurality of MEMS devices as disclosed herein having micromirrors or other suitable deflectable digital light device elements arranged in a suitable array. An optically transmissive layer and a semiconductor substrate can cooperatively define a sealed chamber or cavity in which the deflectable member(s) operate. Typically, the sealed chamber or cavity can contain any suitable fluid or gaseous material for facilitating operation of the deflectable member(s). Where fluids are employed, it is contemplated that the fluid of choice will have suitable properties for enhancing function of the deflectable member, optical reflectivity, or the like. It is contemplated that various dielectric fluids in general and dielectrophoretic fluids in particular may be introduced into the sealed chamber or cavity.",
        "The spatial light modulator is composed of an optically transmissive substrate as defined herein, a semiconductor substrate a spaced distance from the optically transmissive substrate, and deflectable member(s) positioned between the optically transmissive substrate and the semiconductor substrate. The deflectable member(s) may be appropriately configured micromirror(s) positioned between the semiconductor substrate and the optically transmissive substrate and supported by one of the foregoing. The deflectable member(s) are configured to deflect from a rest or optically neutral position to at least one operative position when electrostatically attracted to at least one address electrode located on the semiconductor substrate. The spatial light modulator also includes at least one reset electrode operable on the deflectable member to reset it to the rest or optically neutral position.",
        "The spatial light modulator can be used with various display devices. One such device is depicted in FIG. 9. FIG. 9 is a schematic view of an image projection system 900 using an improved micromirror device as depicted herein. In FIG. 9, light from light source 904 is focused on the micromirror device 902 by lens 906. Although shown as a single lens 906, the lens 906 is typically a group of lenses, integrators, and mirrors that together focus and direct light from light source 904 onto the surface of micromirror device 902. Image data and control signals from controller 914 are written onto a suitable SRAM cell, DRAM cell, or the like, associated with each micromirror. The data in these associated cells cause some of the mirrors to rotate to an on position. Mirrors on the micromirror device 902 that are rotated to an off or rest position can reflect light into a light trap 908 or away from projection lens 910, while mirrors rotated to an on position reflect light to projection lens 910, which is also shown as a single lens for simplicity. Projection lens 910 focuses the light modulated by the micromirror device 902 onto a single image plane or screen 912.",
        "The micromirror device 902 can be configured according to the disclosure herein and will broadly include an optically transmissive substrate, a semiconductor substrate, and at least one micromirror supported by one of the foregoing. The micromirror device 902 may also include at least one address electrode and at least one reset electrode as disclosed herein.",
        "The device disclosed herein may be fabricated in the manner discussed herein in order to construct a microelectromechanical device with a reset electrode. Appropriate spacer layers and patterning processes can be utilized to define appropriate structure such as hinge support posts, address electrode support posts, and the like on a suitable semiconductor substrate having address circuitry defined thereon as at reference numeral 1010 in FIG. 10. Depending upon the location of the reset electrode in the finished microelectromechanical device, the semiconductor substrate can have a reset electrode already defined thereon or the reset electrode can be established on one of either the semiconductor substrate (as at reference numeral 1012) or a region distal to the semiconductor substrate as at reference numeral 1014.",
        "In micromirror devices, it is contemplated that the various elements of the micromirror can be established sequentially through various strategies and processes. Where the reset electrode is positioned on the semiconductor substrate, it is contemplated that the reset electrode can be established as part of the same fabrication sequence. Where the reset electrode is positioned on the optically transparent substrate, it is contemplated that the process can include suitable patterning and deposition of a reset electrode region in the spacer region distal to the semiconductor substrate as at 1014. Alternately, the reset electrode can be established on the optically transmissive substrate by suitable deposition procedures including appropriate patterning and etching processes. Once the micromirror structure is established as at 1016, the optically transparent substrate layer with associated reset electrode can be established as at 1018.",
        "In a simplified outline of a micromirror construction sequence, it is contemplated that a first spacer layer may be established, patterned, and etched to define structures such as address electrode support posts, hinge support posts and optionally one reset electrode and the like to be constructed. Hinge elements may be established in the appropriate spacer layer to connect the hinges to the hinge support posts. Similarly, address electrodes can be established on the address electrode supports.",
        "In order to establish a mirror element, a second spacer layer may be patterned in overlying relationship to the previously defined architecture. The spacer layer can be patterned to define connections between at least one hinge element and at least one mirror element.",
        "An optically transparent substrate may be established in sealed overlying relationship with the mirror assembly and semiconductor substrate along with appropriate removal of sacrificial layers. If not defined on the semiconductor substrate, at least one reset electrode can be established and associated with the optically transmissive substrate in a manner which permits the reset electrode to operate independent of the address electrode and, if need be, generate a bias voltage greater than the address electrode.",
        "While embodiments have been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment(s) but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims, which scope is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures as is permitted under the law."
