    "abstract": "In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for manufacturing an array of interferometric modulators. Each interferometric modulator comprises first and second optical layers which when the interferometric modulator is in an undriven state are spaced by a gap of one size, and when the interferometric modulator is in a driven state are spaced by a gap of another size, the size of the gap determining an optical response of the interferometric modulator. The method comprises fabricating interferometric modulators of a first type characterized by the size of the gap between its first and second optical layers when in the undriven state; fabricating interferometric modulators of a second type characterized by the size of the gap between its first and second optical layers when in the undriven state; and fabricating interferometric modulators of a third type characterized by the size of the gap between its first and second optical layers when in the undriven state, wherein fabricating the interferometric modulators of the first, second, and third types comprises using a sequence of deposition and patterning steps of not more than 9 masking steps to deposit and pattern layers of material on a substrate.",

        "An interferometric modulator is a class of MEM (micro-electromechanical) systems devices which have been described and documented in a variety of patents including U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,835,255, 5,986,796, 6,040,937, 6,055,090, 6,574,033 (application Ser. No. 10/084,893) U.S. Pat. No. 6,680,792 (application Ser. No. 09/974,544) U.S. Pat. No. 6,867,896 (application Ser. No. 09/966,843) and U.S. Pat. No. 7,067,846 (application Ser. No. 10/878,282), and U.S. Patent Application Publication No 2003/0072070 (application Ser. No. 10/082,397), herein incorporated by reference. One of the key attributes of these devices is the fact that they are fabricated monolithically using semiconductor-like fabrication processes. Specifically, these devices are manufactured in a sequence of steps which combine film deposition, photolithography, and etching using a variety of techniques. Costs in manufacturing processes of this sort are driven in large part by the number of steps in the sequence. Thus, a reduction in the number of masking steps in the overall manufacturing process will help to reduce manufacturing costs.",

        "In the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention, numerous specific details are set forth such as examples of specific materials, machines, and methods in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that these specific details need not be employed to practice the present invention. In other instances, well known materials, machines, or methods have not been described in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 6,794,119 (application Ser. No. 10/074,562) herein incorporated by reference describes a prototypical fabrication sequence for building interferometric modulators. In general, interferometric modulator fabrication sequences and categories of sequences are notable for their simplicity and cost effectiveness. This is due in large part to the fact that all of the films are deposited using physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques with sputtering being the preferred and least expensive of the approaches. The materials used are common throughout the liquid crystal display (LCD) industry. This is significant because this industry represents the most cost effective means for manufacturing large area arrays of devices and provides a prime infrastructure for use in building displays and other devices based on interferometric modulators or other MEM devices. This characteristic is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,867,896 herein incorporated by reference. The materials may be etched using low-cost wet etching processes, or higher cost dry etching techniques depending on the demands of the display application and the need for dimensional control. Photolithography may be achieved using low-cost imaging tools or higher cost step and repeat machines, also dependent on the dimensional requirements of the application. The dimensional requirements are primarily dictated by the resolution of the display in display-centric applications.",
        "FIGS. 1A-1F illustrate one embodiment of an interferometric modulator fabrication sequence which utilizes 9 masking steps. Step 1 shows the deposition of a stack of films 100 on a substrate 102. The stack 100 is used in the definition of a black mask. More detail on how a black mask may be incorporated into an interferometric modulator array is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,741,377 (application Ser. No. 10/190,400) herein incorporated by reference. The stack 100 is nominally deposited by sputtering and is subsequently patterned in Step 2. Patterning refers to a class of techniques which usually include a lithographic step, a development step, and a material etch step. These are well known in the art and described in detail in the aforementioned patents and patent applications.",
        "In Step 3, an insulator 106, an optical film 108, and a conductor 1010 are deposited also using sputtering and are of a thickness and composition which has been described in the aforementioned patents and patent applications. Examples of the insulator, optical film, and conductor include silicon dioxide, chrome, and aluminum respectively. The optical film 108 and the conductor 1010 have been subsequently patterned in Step 4.",
        "For interferometric modulator matrices that are to be multi-color displays, some mechanism must be provided for depositing and patterning sacrificial layers with multiple heights. The height of the sacrificial layer is what determines one of the color modes or states of the interferometric modulator during operation. Typical full-color displays require matrices capable of display in at least three colors, Red, Green, and Blue.",
        "FIG. 1B begins with Step 5 where the conductor 1010 has been further patterned to form the conductor rails. These rails are used to enhance the conductivity of the underlying chrome and thereby improve the performance of the overall display by reducing R/C time constants. In Step 6, an insulating film or films 1012 has been deposited. Step 7 reveals where insulator film/s 1012 have been patterned to expose the optical film 108 as a lead 1014 for bonding at a later step.",
        "FIG. 1C reveals the deposition of a first sacrificial layer 1016 in Step 8 using sputtering and its subsequent patterning in Step 9. Step 10 shows the deposition of a second sacrificial layer 1018 also using sputtering.",
        "FIG. 1D begins in Step 11 with the patterning of sacrificial layer 1018 followed by the deposition of a third sacrificial layer 1020 in Step 12. In Step 13, an etch step is performed, the goal of which is to define support post vias 1022. This may be done using either wet or dry etching techniques as all of the previous etches may be accomplished.",
        "FIG. 1E reveals the definition of support posts 1024. More detail on how this process can be accomplished is contained in U.S. Pat. No. 6,794,119 herein incorporated by reference. In one embodiment, a negative acting photosensitive material is spun onto the structure and is exposed through the post support vias through the backside of the wafer illustrated by incident light arrows 1026. The post support vias are transparent to the light because the sacrificial layers are designed to be opaque. Thus the sacrificial layers act as a mask and save on an additional masking step. Step 14 shows support posts 1024 that are formed in each support post via 1022. The support posts 1029 may be polymeric, though they could be of any photo-definable material or material matrix. Step 15 shows the definition of a planar cover material 1028 which is used to smooth the topology presented by conductor rails 1010. This is accomplished using standard lithography. In Step 16 a mechanical film/s 1030 has been deposited.",
        "FIG. 1F begins with Step 17 where the mechanical layer 1030 has been patterned to form the interferometric modulator matrix Red, Green, and Blue columns which are distinguished by the different sacrificial layer heights, 1032, 1034, and 1036. Finally, in Step 18, the sacrificial layer has been removed using one of a variety of etching techniques. The preferred technique uses XeF2 gas to spontaneously etch the sacrificial material. More detail on this approach can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,794,119 herein incorporated by reference.",
        "Steps 8-12 of the previous sequence represent the sacrificial layer subprocess, i.e. the sequence of steps whereby the sacrificial layer heights are defined and patterned. This is an additive approach. FIG. 2 illustrates an alternative sacrificial layer sub-process that includes a subtractive approach. Referring to FIG. 2, substrate 200 is coated with a multilayer sacrificial stack which comprises two different materials which are both etchable using XeF2, but which are wet etched, or potentially dry etched, using different chemistries. Silicon and molybdenum are two candidates, though there are others, for both these substances can be etched using XeF2 However, silicon can be wet etched by hot solutions of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (among other etchants) while molybdenum can be etched using solutions of phosphoric, acetic, and nitric acid. Step 1 shows the multilayer stack deposited on substrate 200, with silicon layers 202 and 204 acting as an etch stop, and molybdenum layers 206, 208, and 210 acting as the height definition layers. The first resist layer 212 has been defined in Step 2 and in Step 3, the first patterning step has been accomplished using this layer with the pattern then transferred to the molybdenum layer 206. The next resist layer 214 has also been defined in Step 3. Step 4 shows the subsequent patterning step which involves a two stage etch step. Masked by resist layer 214, the first stage molybdenum layer 208 is patterned using the appropriate etchant, and in the second stage, silicon etch stop layer 204 has been etched through. Finally, in Step 5, molybdenum layer 210 has been etched by virtue of being masked by a resist layer 216. Because of the existence of etch stop layers 202 and 204, the etchant can be used to pattern the height definition layers without concerns about overetching. The material may be exposed for as long as possible to insure complete etching of the feature with fear of etching into the next height definition layer which would compromise the overall process.",
        "The sub-process of FIG. 2 requires three separate lithography steps. Using gray-scale lithography this may be reduced. FIG. 3 illustrates a variation on this theme which exploits gray-scale lithography to reduce the number of masking steps to one. Referring to FIG. 3 a multilayer etch stack 310 has been deposited on substrate 312 and is identical to the etch stack of FIG. 2. A gray-scale mask 300 which is like a normal lithographic mask except that regions on it may be defined to have variable levels of transmission as opposed to binary levels in traditional masks is positioned over the stack 310. There are numerous ways of preparing such masks as is well known in the art. For this case, three regions have been defined with three different transmission levels shown with zero transmission at a region 302, moderate transmission at a region 304, and the highest at a region 306. In Step 1 when a photoresist layer 308 over the stack 310 is exposed, a well-timed development stage will result in the photoresist below region 306 developing first. The developer stage is a standard part of patterning where photoresist or other photosensitive material, which has been exposed to light, is dissolved away in a chemical solution specially designed for this task. The consequence of the first development stage is that the mutilayer etch material under region 306 is exposed. In Step 2 the first etch step is accomplished which defines the first height. In Step 3, after another developer stage, the material under region 304 is exposed and etched appropriately while the region under 306 is etched to the next level. Finally a solvent or other resist removal process is used to finish off the process.",
        "FIGS. 4A-C, 5A-B, and 6A-B illustrate reduced mask fabrication sequences. These sequences differ from the sequence of FIGS. 1A-F in that they do not contain a black mask, a conductor, or a conductor planarization layer. Certain applications and device designs may eliminate or reduce the need for a black mask. Other applications may not require the addition of a conductor or may have their conductivity sufficiently increased by the presence of a transparent conductor.",
        "FIGS. 4A-C illustrate a sequence that uses 4 mask steps. Beginning with Step 1 in FIG. 4A, optical film/s 402 are deposited on a substrate 400. The optical films may or may not include a transparent conductor 404. In Step 2 these films are patterned and in Step 3 an insulating film or films 406 is/are deposited followed by the deposition of a sacrificial material 408 in Step 4. FIG. 4B begins with Step 5 where post support vias 410 have been etched into the sacrificial spacer 408. Spacer posts 412 are formed in Step 6 according to the processes described above, and a mechanical film 414 has been deposited in Step 7.",
        "FIG. 4C starts in Step 8 where sacrificial layer 408 has been etched back, optional etch hole 410 has been formed, and insulator 406 has been etched subsequently in Step 9 to expose optical film 404 for later bonding. The sacrificial layer has been removed in Step 10.",
        "FIGS. 5A-B illustrate a 3 mask step process. Starting with Step 1 in FIG. 5A a starter stack 502 has been deposited on substrate 500. The starter stack 502 comprises optical/conductor films 504, insulator 506, and a sacrificial layer 508. Step 2 shows the etching of the entire starter stack which constitutes the step consolidation that removes a mask step, and provides support post vias 510. In Step 3, the support posts 512 have been formed and a mechanical film 514 is deposited in Step 4.",
        "FIG. 5B shows in Step 5 the etching of the mechanical film 512, the sacrificial layer 508, and etch hole 514. Step 6 illustrates the etching of the insulator 506. Finally the sacrificial layer is removed using XeF2 in Step 7. Steps 5 and 6 represent the consolidation of a mask step in this sequence since only one mask step is required to accomplish both.",
        "FIG. 6A illustrates a 2 mask step process. Referring to FIG. 6A, in Step 1 a starter stack comprising a substrate 602, optical/conductor films 604, an insulator 606, and a spacer 608 is patterned to form support post vias 610. In Step 2, the vias 610 are filled with a support post material 612, and a mechanical film layer 614 is deposited in Step 3. In Step 4, the mechanical layer 614, the spacer 608, and the insulator 606 are etched to expose optical film layers 604 for subsequent bonding. Step 5 is a final step where the sacrificial layer 608 is removed.",
        "FIG. 7 illustrates a further means for consolidating mask steps by combining the process for forming the support post vias with the formation of the support posts themselves. This approach relies on a technique which is known in the industry as lift-off. Basically this means that a pattern can be formed in a deposited material not by etching it after deposition, but by forming the pattern during the deposition. One way of achieving this is explained in FIG. 7.",
        "In Step 1 of FIG. 7, a starter stack 702 has been deposited on a substrate 700 and a negative photoresist 704 has been has been spun on. While positive a photoresist may be used, negative resist has the property that a so-called \u201cre-entrant\u201d profile may be formed. A re-entrant profile is one in which the top of the resist is effectively undercut during development. Negative resist differs from positive resist in that exposed negative resist remains during the development process Mask 710 serves to block light 708 and prevent the exposure of the photoresist below. However diffractive effects actually cause some of the incident light to be redirected underneath the mask. This redirected light 706 produces a \u201clip\u201d 712 and associated re-entrant profile during Step 2, which shows in the resist after development.",
        "The opening in the resist is used as a mask to define the support post via 714 when it is etched into the starter stack 700. Step 3 illustrates a lift-off process for establishing the support posts which in this case are deposited using some form of physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique as opposed to being spun on and photopolymerized using topside or backside exposure. Because of the re-entrant profile, a distinct break is formed between the post material in the hole 718 and the excess post material on the surface of the photoresist 716. Thus in Step 4, the excess material is removed in a lift-off process which uses a liquid solvent to dissolve the remaining photoresist and remove all post material which resides on top of it.",
        "In another embodiment, the fabrication process is further streamlined by the elimination of the support posts. This is shown in FIG. 8 and involves the use of the mechanical film in a self-supporting role. Beginning in Step 1 a starter stack, comprising optical films 802 and sacrificial film 804, is shown deposited on substrate 800. By proper application of etching techniques, a via, 806, is etched onto the stack which exhibits a sloped profile. That is to say, the sidewalls of the via have a profile which is opposite that of the re-entrant profile described in FIG. 7. Because of this, when mechanical film 808 is deposited as in Step 3, the resulting film is conformal and covers the slopes of the via without any break. When the sacrificial film, 808, is removed in step 4, the mechanical film remains standing because it supports itself by being attached to the substrate. This technique may be utilized in all of the process sequences described within this patent application. Advanced interferometric modulator architectures such as those described in patent application Ser. No. 08/769,947 filed on Dec. 19, 1996, now abandoned (a divisional application of which is U.S. Pat. No. 6,680,792 herein incorporated by reference), may also be fabricated using extensions of the previously described process sequences. In this architecture the support structure for the movable mirror is defined separately and positioned in such a way as to be hidden from view. Such a design offers improvements in fill factor, and uniformity in performance.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 9A-D of the drawings, beginning with Step 1 in FIG. 9, optical films 900 and 902 have been deposited and subsequently patterned in Step 2. Step 3 reveals the deposition of insulator film 904, followed by the deposition of a sacrificial layer, 908, and a mirror material, 906. The mirror is shown after it has been patterned in Step 5, and an additional sacrificial material, 910, has been deposited in Step 6. Step 7 illustrates how the supports and mechanical connections are formed. The patterning which occurs in this step is such that vias 912 etch until stopped by mirror 906, while vias 914 are etched, in the same step, until stopped by insulator film 904 which may be an oxide layer. In this way, and as shown in Step 8, polymer supports 916, are formed using backside exposure techniques to expose the vias 914. Step 9 reveals how a mechanical support layer 918, is deposited and consequently forms a mechanical connection to mirror 906 at the junctions indicated by 920. In Step 10, etch holes 22 are formed, and the entire structure is released in Step 11 using a gas phase etchant.",
        "The fabrication sequences above are meant to illustrate various methods for building interferometric modulator matrices using different mask counts. They are not meant to be limiting in any way in terms of materials used, steps consolidated, or order of steps."
