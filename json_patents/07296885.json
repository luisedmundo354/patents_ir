        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a liquid composition for ink jet printing, an ink set for ink jet printing, an ink jet recording method, and an ink jet recording apparatus.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Ink jet systems for ejecting ink from an ink ejection port formed of a nozzle, a slit or a porous film have been used in many printers due to their being small-sized and inexpensive. Of these ink jet systems, a piezo ink jet system for ejecting ink by utilizing the deformation of a piezoelectric unit and a thermal ink jet system for ejecting ink by utilizing the boiling phenomenon of an ink by way of thermal energy are excellent in a high resolution and a high-speed printing property.",
        "At present, increased speed and enhancement of picture quality on plain paper are taken as one of the important objective of an ink jet printer. In order to attaining this objectives, there has been proposed an image forming method of adhering a liquid containing a compound having a cationic group onto a recording medium and then adhering an ink containing an anion dye immediately after the liquid has permeated into the recording medium and is thus present in the medium, and has left the surface of the medium, thereby forming an amage (see U.S. Pat. No. 2,667,401, for example). In this method, in some cases in which the time required for drying of an ink is shortened, the density of an image is insufficient. In some cases in which printing is carried out with a small amount of drops, moreover, the long term ejecting property is insufficient.",
        "In order to obtain a high-speed drying property, a high optical density and enhancement of picture quality, moreover, there has been proposed a color ink set characterized by a black ink containing water and a water-soluble solvent, a drying time on a piece of plain paper being equal to or less than five seconds, a color ink containing a coloring agent, water, a water-soluble solvent and a flocculant for flocculating the components of the black ink, and the time required for permeation in the plain paper being equal to or less than five seconds (for example, see JP-A No. 2001-294788). In some cases in which this system is used and a pigment is used for the coloring agent of a color ink, there is excellent optical density, blur and intercolor blur, but long-term storage stability is insufficient due to a flocculant. An electrolyte or a polyvalent metallic salt is usually used for the flocculant, and there is also a problem in that their effect as the flocculant are excessively great.",
        "In order to improve jetting property of an inkjet sustem, moreover, there has been proposed an ink containing a nitrogen-containing five-membered ring keto acid such as pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a salt thereof (see JP-A No. 63-265681; U.S. Pat. No. 2,711,888 and JP-A No. 2000-109735, for example). This system utilizes the effect of a moisturizing property provided by the nitrogen-containing five-membered ring keto acid salt and has an objective of improving the jetting property. In some cases in which a liquid containing the nitrogen-containing five-membered ring keto acid is used together with a liquid containing a coloring material as in the invention, however, it is impossible to achieve compatibility of picture quality and long-term storage stability.",
        "As described above, with conventional methods, it is impossible to simultaneously have satisfactory optical density, blur, intercolor blur, drying time, and long-term storage stability.",
        "Accordingly, the present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and provides an ink set for ink jet printing, an ink jet recording method and an ink jet recording apparatus which are excellent in optical density, blur, intercolor blur, drying time, and long-term storage stability.",
        "Further, the invention provides a liquid composition for ink jet printing to be used therein.",

As a result, it was concluded that the claims of the invention are met and an optical density, a blur, an intercolor blur, a drying time and a long-term storage stability are thus satisfied at the same time.",

        "The invention will be described below in detail.",
        "(Ink Set for Ink Jet and Liquid Composition for Ink Jet)",
        "An ink set for ink jet according to the invention is constituted to include a first liquid and a second liquid which is caused to have the function of flocculating the first liquid. As the second liquid, there is used a liquid composition for ink jet containing an organic acid having an acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less (a liquid composition for ink jet according to the invention), preferably, a liquid composition for ink jet further containing an organic amine compound or a polyvalent metallic salt in a specific ratio with respect to the organic acid.",
        "By carrying out printing in such a manner that the first liquid and the second liquid come in contact with each other, it is possible to improve an optical density, a blur and an intercolor blur. Although a mechanism is not apparent, it is supposed that the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less has the function of flocculating the first liquid, and the printing is carried out to cause the two kinds of liquids to come in contact with each other over a recording medium and a coloring material can be thus caused to stay on the surface of the recording medium at a high density.",
        "Referring to the reason why the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less is suitable for a material to flocculate the first liquid, it is guessed that there are three following reasons.",
        "<1> The organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less has a high degree of dissociation of an acidic group and is acidic. In the case in which a coloring material having an anionic surface functional group is used for the first liquid, accordingly, the function of inhibiting the dissociation of the surface functional group of the coloring material of the first liquid is fulfilled when the two liquids come in contact with each other, and the coloring material is thus flocculated.",
        "<2> It can be supposed that the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less has the function of a pH buffer. For this reason, there is a feature that a pH fluctuation caused by the concentration of a hydrogen ion is small within the specific pH range of an acidity. As a result, it can be supposed that pH is maintained on an acid side and the coloring material of the first liquid can be flocculated effectively when the first liquid and the second liquid are mixed with each other.",
        "<3> There is also a function of the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less and an electrolyte. Accordingly, it can be supposed that an electrostatic repulsive force between pigments is reduced to promote a flocculation in the case in which the pigments are used for the coloring material of the first liquid.",
        "Referring to the reason why the polyvalent metallic salt is suitable for a material to flocculate the first liquid, next, it is mainly guessed that there are two following reasons.",
        "<1> In a system using a pigment as a coloring material, it is supposed that the polyvalent metallic salt attenuates an electrostatic repulsive force between-pigments and produces an advantage to promote the flocculation of the pigments.",
        "<2> It can be supposed that a polyvalent metal forms an ionomer structure with a carboxylic acid in the case in which a pigment having a carboxylic acid group on a surface thereof or a liquid containing an organic compound having the carboxylic acid group is mixed. Accordingly, the size of a molecular structure is increased, and at the same time, the amount of a hydrophilic group on the surface of a pigment or the amount of a hydrophilic group of an organic compound is decreased. For this reason, it can be supposed that the pigment or the organic compound can be flocculated. Furthermore, it is supposed that the organic compound is flocculated while taking another coloring material therein. Therefore, the flocculation of the coloring material is accelerated in the case in which a dye is used for the coloring material in addition to the case in which the pigment is used.",
        "On the other hand, it was also found that the organic acid and the polyvalent metallic salt cause the following drawbacks, respectively.",
        "It is desirable that the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less should be used in a partial neutralizing state in order to enhance a flocculation efficiency and to improve picture quality. However, there is the case in which it is hard to cause the picture quality to be compatible with a long-term storage stability. Although the mechanism is not apparent, it can be supposed that the organic acid is deposited when an addition is carried out in a high concentration because the organic acid does not have a sufficient solubility to water.",
        "Referring to the polyvalent metallic salt, it is desirable that the amount of addition should be increased in order to enhance a flocculation efficiency and to improve picture quality. However, it was found that a directional defect is generated in some cases in which the amount of the addition of the polyvalent metallic salt is increased. Although the mechanism is not apparent, it can be supposed that the polyvalent metallic salt is deposited and stuck onto the tip of a nozzle, resulting in a variation in the water repellency of the nozzle.",
        "In consideration of the results, therefore, vigorous investigations were made. As a result, it was found that picture quality, and a long-term storage stability and a long-term jet reliability are compatible with each other by using the organic acid and the polyvalent metallic salt in a proper ratio. Although the mechanism is not apparent, it can be supposed that an intermolecular interaction such as a chelate action is caused between a polyvalent metal and an organic acid and both of them can be present stably. Furthermore, it has been known that the polyvalent metallic salt generates a slightly water-soluble hydroxide ion under an alkali condition. It is guessed that there is an advantage that the generation of the hydroxide salt of a polyvalent metal can be suppressed and a stabilization can be thus obtained by the addition of the polyvalent metallic salt together with the organic acid.",
        "By using an organic amine compound as an alkali agent for dissolving an organic acid together with the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less, it is possible to enhance a solubility into the water of the organic acid also in a low neutralizing state and to thereby cause the reliability of a liquid composition and the picture quality to be compatible with each other. Although the mechanism is not apparent, it is supposed that both the organic acid and the organic amine compound have a hydrocarbon type skeleton and an affinity is enhanced by a hydrophobic interaction.",

On the other hand, in the case in which the mole radio of the amount of addition of the organic amine compound to the organic acid is more than 1:0.9 (that is, the amount of the organic amine compound is too large), the flocculation of a coloring material becomes insufficient in a mixture with the first liquid so that the quality of an image is not enhanced.",

A dye, a pigment having sulfonic acid or sulfonate on a surface, and a self-dispersing pigment are -preferable for the coloring material to be contained in the second liquid. The reason is follows. It can be supposed that these coloring materials tend to be flocculated in an acidic region with difficulty and the organic acid having the acid dissociation constant pKa of 4.5 or less and the polyvalent metallic salt can be prevented from being flocculated. By using such a coloring material, the storage stability of the second liquid can be enhanced. It is possible to use the dye, the pigment having the sulfonic acid or the sulfonate on the surface and the self-dispersing pigment which are the same as those described as the coloring materials of the first liquid.",

In some cases in which the amount of the water-soluble organic solvent in the liquid is less than 1% by mass, a sufficient optical density cannot be obtained. To the contrary, in some cases in which the amount of the water-soluble organic solvent is more than 60% by mass, the viscosity of the liquid is increased so that the jet characteristic of the liquid becomes unstable.",

In some cases in which the surface tension is less than 20 mN/m, the liquid overflows into a nozzle surface and printing cannot be carried out normally. On the other hand, in some cases in which the surface tension is more than 45 mN/m, a permeability is obtained slowly so that a drying time is prolonged.",

The same number is more preferably equal to or more than 2,500/\u03bcL and is further preferably equal to or more than 5,000/\u03bcL. In some cases in which the number of the coarse particles having the size of 5 \u03bcm or more in the mixed solution of the first liquid and the second liquid is less than 1,000/\u03bcL, an optical density is reduced.",

        "(Ink Jet Recording Method and Ink Jet Recording Apparatus)",
        "An ink jet recording method according to the invention serves to carry out printing so as to cause a first liquid and a second liquid to come in contact with each other by using an ink set for ink jet according to the invention. Moreover, an ink jet recording apparatus according to the invention comprises recording heads for ejecting, to a recording medium, liquids in the ink set for ink jet according to the invention. These can apply a recording apparatus provided with a heater for controlling the drying of an ink or a recording apparatus provided with an intermediate transfer mechanism and serving to print a recording material on an intermediate member and then carrying out a transfer onto a recording medium such as a paper in addition to an ordinary ink jet recording apparatus.",
        "In the ink jet recording method (apparatus) according to the invention, it is preferable that both the first liquid and the second liquid should have a mass per drop of 25 ng or less. The mass is more preferably equal to or more than 0.5 ng and equal to or less than 20 ng and is further preferably equal to or more than 2 ng and equal to or less than 8 ng. In some cases in which the mass per drop is more than 25 ng, a blur is caused more seriously. The reason is as follows. It can be supposed that the contact angles of the first liquid and the second liquid with the recording medium are changed depending on the amount of a drop and the drop tends to spread in the direction of the surface of the paper when the amount of the drop is increased.",
        "In an ink jet apparatus capable of jetting drops having a plurality of volumes from one nozzle, the amount of the drop indicates the amount of a minimum drop capable of carrying out printing.",
        "Moreover, the first liquid and the second liquid are applied onto the recording medium in order to come in contact with each other. When the first liquid and the second liquid come in contact with each other, an ink is flocculated by the action of a flocculating agent. Thus, it is possible to obtain a recording method which is excellent in an optical density, a blur, an intercolor blur and a drying time. If they come in contact with each other, they may be applied adjacently to each other or may be covered with each other.",
        "For the order of application onto the recording medium, furthermore, the second liquid is applied and the first liquid is then applied. By applying the second liquid earlier, it is possible to effectively flocculate the component in the first liquid. The first liquid may be applied at any time after the second liquid is applied. It is preferable that the first liquid may be applied after 0.1 second or less after the application of the second liquid.",
        "In the ink jet recording method (apparatus) according to the invention, it is preferable that a mass ratio of the amount of application of the first liquid to the amount of application of the second liquid which is required for forming one pixel should be 1:20 to 20:1. The mass ratio is more preferably 1:10 to 10:1 and is further preferably 1:5 to 5:1. In some cases in which the amount of application of the first liquid is much smaller or larger than the amount of application of the second ink, the flocculation becomes insufficient so that the optical density is reduced, the blur is caused more seriously and the intercolor blur is deteriorated. The pixel implies a lattice point constituted when a desirable image is divided at a minimum distance where the ink can be applied in a scanning direction and a sub-scanning direction. By giving a proper ink set to each pixel, a color and an image density can be regulated and an image is thus formed.",
        "It is preferable that the ink jet recording method (apparatus) according to the invention should employ a thermal ink jet recording system or a piezo ink jet recording system in respect of an effect of improving a blur and an intercolor blur. The cause is not apparent. Although an ink is heated during an ejection so that a viscosity is reduced in case of the thermal ink jet recording system, the temperature of the ink is dropped over a recording medium so that the viscosity is suddenly increased. Therefore, it can be supposed that there is an effect of improving a blur and an intercolor blur. On the other hand, in case of the piezo ink jet system, a liquid having a high viscosity can be ejected. It is possible to suppress the spread of the liquid having a high viscosity over the recording medium in the direction of the surface of the paper. Consequently, it is guessed that there is an effect of improving the blur and the intercolor blur.",

An image forming apparatus 100 according to the embodiment has such a structure as to be operated to form an image based on the ink jet recording method according to the invention. More specifically, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the image forming apparatus 100 is mainly constituted by an external cover 6, a tray 7 capable of mounting a recording medium 1 such as a plain paper in a predetermined amount, a delivery roller (delivery means) 2 for delivering the recording medium 1 every sheet into the image forming apparatus 100 and an image forming portion 8 (image forming means) for ejecting an ink and a liquid composition to the surface of the recording medium 1, thereby forming an image.",

        "The ink tank 5 has ink tanks 51, 52, 53, 54 and 55 which store inks or liquid compositions having different colors from each other so as to be ejected. These accommodate a black ink (K), a yellow ink (Y), a magenta ink (M) and a cyan ink (C) as a first liquid and a treating solution as a second liquid, for example. Of course, it is not necessary to provide an ink tank for the treating solution separately when the second liquid contains a coloring material.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2, furthermore, the feeding signal cable 9 and the ink tank 5 are connected to the recording head 3. When external image recording information is input from the feeding signal cable 9 to the recording head 3, the recording head 3 sucks an ink in a predetermined amount from each of the ink tanks and ejects the same ink onto the surface of the recording medium based on the image recording information. The feeding signal cable 9 also plays a part in the supply of a necessary power for driving the recording head 3 to the recording head 3 in addition to the image recording information.",
        "Moreover, the recording head 3 is provided and held on the carriage 10, and the guide rod 11 and the timing belt 12 connected to the driving pulley 13 are connected to the carriage 10. By such a structure, the recording head 3 can also be moved in a direction Y (a scanning direction) which is parallel with the surface of the recording medium 1 and is perpendicular to a delivery direction X (a sub-scanning direction) of the recording medium 1 along the guide rod 11.",
        "The image forming apparatus 100 comprises control means (not shown) for regulating the driving timing of the recording head 3 and the driving timing of the carriage 10 based on image recording information. Consequently, it is possible to continuously form an image based on the image recording information in a predetermined region over the surface of the recording medium 1 to be delivered at a predetermined speed in the delivery direction X.",

Furthermore, the maintenance unit 14 is connected to the nozzle portion of the recording head 3 and has the function of setting the inside of the nozzle of the recording head 3 into a pressure reducing state, thereby sucking an ink from the nozzle of the recording head 3. By providing the maintenance unit 14, it is possible to remove an excessive ink stuck to the nozzle during the operation of the image forming apparatus 100 if necessary or to suppress the evaporation of the ink from the nozzle in an operation stop state.",

The recording head 3 sequentially arranges ink tanks 51 to 55 in the sub-scanning direction (the delivery direction of the recording medium 1: the direction of the arrow X) and similarly arranges a nozzle group for ejecting each color (including a treating solution) in the sub-scanning direction, which is not shown.
