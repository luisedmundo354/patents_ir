        "In the examples, the following procedures were followed. To evaluate the effect of additives on hydrolytic stability of polycarbonate-polyester blends, samples were cut from 20-mil film and then exposed to 70\u00b0 C. and 100% relative humidity by suspending the films in the vapor space of sealed jars containing a small amount of water and placed inside a forced air oven set at 70\u00b0 C. Small samples were subsequently taken periodically and the molecular weight distribution for the polyester and polycarbonate components determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The GPC method for the polycarbonate fraction consisted of first immersing the blends in tetrahydrofuran to selectively extract the polycarbonate. The GPC system used to analyze the polycarbonate fraction consisted of a Perkin-Elmer LC-250 pump, a Perkin-Elmer LC-600 autosampler, and a Perkin-Elmer LC-235 photodiode array UV detector operated at 265 nm. The columns used were a Plgel 5-micron guard, a Mixed-C, and an Oligopore from Polymer Laboratories. The molecular weight distribution was computed using monodisperse polystyrene standards for calibration and the Mark-Houwink constants for polystyrene and polycarbonate available in the literature. The solvent used for the polyester fraction was 70/30-v/v hexafluoroisopropanol/methylene chloride mixture, which is also a good solvent for polycarbonate. The GPC system used consisted of a Perkin-Elmer LC-250 pump, a Perkin-Elmer ISS-200 autosampler, and a Perkin-Elmer LC-95 UV/VIS detector operated at 285 nm. The absorption coefficient of terephthalate based copolyesters at 285 nm is considerably greater than the coefficient for polycarbonate so that the method selectively detects the polyester. The columns used were a Plgel 5-micron guard and a Mixed-C from Polymer Laboratories. The molecular weight distribution was computed using monodisperse polystyrene standards for calibration and Mark-Houwink constants for polystyrene measured in this solvent. Universal calibration constants for each polyester were chosen to yield accurate molecular weight values for a series of samples that were characterized by light scattering measurement.",

An increase in the positive b* value indicates yellowness, while a decrease in the numerical value of b* indicates a reduction in yellowness. Color measurement and practice are discussed in greater detail in Anni Berger-Schunn in Practical Color Measurement, Wiley, N.Y. pages 39\u201356 and 91\u201398 (1994).

The following commercial phosphates were utilized: Ultranox 626 (GE Specialty Chemicals, CAS# 26741-53-7, bis(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite), Ultranox 641 (GE Specialty Chemicals, CAS# 26741-53-7, 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenyl-2-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol phosphite), Weston 619 (GE Specialty Chemicals, CAS# 3806-34-6, distearyl pentaerythritol diphosphite) and Doverphos S-9228 (Dover Chemicals, CAS# 154862-43-8, bis(2,4-dicumylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite). The phosphite stabilizers were precompounded with polyester A using an 19-mm APV twin-screw extruder at 250\u00b0 C., 200 RPM, at a rate of about 5 lbs/hr to produce concentrates containing 5 percent phosphite stabilizer. Blends of polyester A and polycarbonate A were prepared by melt blending a 3:1 weight ratio of polyester A with polycarbonate A, respectively, with 0.5 weight percent of the various phosphite stabilizers as reported in Table 1. The blends were prepared as 20-mil extrusion cast films using a 1\u2033 Killion single-screw extruder at 275\u00b0 C. and 70 RPM. The films were subsequently conditioned at 70\u00b0 C. and 100% relative humidity for up to 3 weeks and the molecular weight of the polyester A and polycarbonate A components determined by GPC as previously described. The results are shown in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the addition of a phosphite stabilizer improves the blend color (i.e. less yellow as represented by lower b*); however, the phosphites are detrimental to hydrolytic stability of the blend as indicated by significant decrease in molecular weight for both the polyester A and polycarbonate A components.",

        "These examples illustrate different methods of preparing the phosphorous acid salts. To a clean, dry 5 L three neck round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and addition funnel was added 100 g of Cyasorb UV-3529, which is described in Examples 8\u201310, and 575 g of toluene. The mixture was stirred until a homogeneous solution was obtained. To a clean dry 2 L beaker was added 28.05 g (0.34 mol) of phosphorous acid and 575 g of isopropyl alcohol. The mixture was stirred until a homogeneous solution was obtained. The phosphorous acid solution was added to the addition funnel and delivered to the stirred reaction vessel over 2 h (added dropwise). Stirring was continued for about 30 min upon complete addition of the phosphorous acid solution. The reaction product was precipitated by adding half of the reaction mixture to each of two 4 L beakers that contained 2475 g of rapidly stirred heptane (equipped with a mechanical stirrer). The solid material was collected by suction filtration and washed with 500 mL of heptane then allowed to dry on the filter paper overnight. The solid cake was broken up, placed into a 12\u2033\u00d77\u2033\u00d72\u2033 aluminum pan and dried in a vacuum oven at 70\u00b0 C. at about 150 torr with a slight ingress of dry nitrogen for 24 h to give 135.07 g of material (>100% of theory, slightly solvent wet).",
        "Blends of polyester B and polycarbonate B (70:30 blend ratio by weight) were melt blended along with 0.1 weight percent of the phosphorous acid salt prepared by an organic method (Example 20), the phosphorous acid salt prepared by a mechanical method described in Example 9 (Example 21) and Weston 619 (Example 22) for comparison. The phosphorous acid salts and Weston 619 were compounded with polyester B using a 30-mm WP twin-screw extruder at 250\u00b0 C., 250 RPM at a rate of about 40 lbs/hr to produce concentrates containing 5 percent of each additive. The blends were prepared as 20-mil extrusion cast films using a 1\u2033 Killion single-screw extruder at 275\u00b0 C. and 70 RPM. The blends were evaluated for hydroytic stability at 70\u00b0 C. and 100% relative humidity for up to 6 weeks as described previously and the results are shown in Tables 7. The results show significantly improved hydrolytic stability for the blends containing the phosphorous acid salts whether prepared by an organic method (Example 20) or a mechanical method (Example 21) compared to the commercial phosphite stabilizer Weston 619 (Example 22).",
