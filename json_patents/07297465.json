        "The present invention relates to a heat-sensitive, positive working lithographic printing plate precursor.",
        "Lithographic printing presses use a so-called printing master such as a printing plate which is mounted on a cylinder of the printing press. The master carries a lithographic image on its surface and a print is obtained by applying ink to said image and then transferring the ink from the master onto a receiver material, which is typically paper. In conventional, so-called \u201cwet\u201d lithographic printing, ink as well as an aqueous fountain solution (also called dampening liquid) are supplied to the lithographic image which consists of oleophilic (or hydrophobic, i.e. ink-accepting, water-repelling) areas as well as hydrophilic (or oleophobic, i.e. water-accepting, ink-repelling) areas. In so-called driographic printing, the lithographic image consists of ink-accepting and ink-abhesive (ink-repelling) areas and during driographic printing, only ink is supplied to the master.",
        "Printing masters are generally obtained by the so-called computer-to-film method wherein various pre-press steps such as typeface selection, scanning, color separation, screening, trapping, layout and imposition are accomplished digitally and each color selection is transferred to graphic arts film using an image-setter. After processing, the film can be used as a mask for the exposure of an imaging material called plate precursor and after plate processing, a printing plate is obtained which can be used as a master.",
        "A typical printing plate precursor for computer-to-film methods comprise a hydrophilic support and an image-recording layer of a photosensitive polymer which include UV-sensitive diazo compounds, dichromate-sensitized hydrophilic colloids and a large variety of synthetic photopolymers. Particularly diazo-sensitized systems are widely used. Upon image-wise exposure, typically by means of a film mask in a UV contact frame, the exposed image areas become insoluble and the unexposed areas remain soluble in an aqueous alkaline developer. The plate is then processed with the developer to remove the diazonium salt or diazo resin in the unexposed areas. So the exposed areas define the image areas (printing areas) of the printing master, and such printing plate precursors are therefore called \u2018negative-working\u2019. Also positive-working materials, wherein the exposed areas define the non-printing areas, are known, e.g. plates having a novolac/naphtoquinone-diazide coating which dissolves in the developer only at exposed areas.",
        "In addition to the above photosensitive materials, also heat-sensitive printing plate precursors have become very popular. Such thermal materials offer the advantage of daylight-stability and are especially used in the so-called computer-to-plate method wherein the plate precursor is directly exposed, i.e. without the use of a film mask. The material is exposed to heat or to infrared light and the generated heat triggers a (physico-)chemical process, such as ablation, polymerization, insolubilisation by cross-linking of a polymer, heat-induced solubilisation, decomposition, or particle coagulation of a thermoplastic polymer latex.",
        "EP 0 864 420 discloses a heat mode imaging element for making lithographic printing plates comprising on a lithographic base having a hydrophilic surface an intermediate layer comprising a polymer, soluble in an aqueous alkaline solution and a top layer that is sensitive to IR-radiation wherein said top layer upon exposure to IR-radiation has a decreased or increased capacity for being penetrated and/or solubilised by an aqueous alkaline solution.",

        "The last two heat-mode imaging elements have the disadvantage that the difference between the solubility in the exposed areas and in the non-exposed areas is not very great so that also non-exposed areas are dissolved during the processing of the element so that the plates could not be used as lithographic plates.",
        "WO 97/39894 describes a positive-working heat-sensitive printing plate precursor which is sensitive to IR light but not to UV light, comprising a support and an IR-sensitive coating comprising an oleophilic polymer that is soluble in an aqueous alkaline developer and a dissolution inhibitor which reduces the solubility of the polymer in the developer.",
        "WO99/21725 and WO99/21715 describe a heat sensitive printing plate precursor provided with a coating comprising a compound which increases the developer resistance of the coating. Said compound is selected from the group of poly(alkylene oxide), siloxanes and esters or amides of polyhydric alcohols.",

        "The prior art printing plate precursors comprising compounds which increase the developer resistance of the coating such as for example polysiloxanes, also have a broad development latitude, i.e. the differentiation between the development kinetics of exposed and non-exposed areas is increased in the sense that exposed areas are completely dissolved before the non-exposed areas start to dissolve. However, the minimum energy density required to solubilize the exposed areas in the developer of these printing plate precursors is high, and therefore, long exposure times and/or the use of more expensive exposure devices such as lasers with a high laser power output are required.",
        "Therefore, there is still a need for printing plate precursors which have an improved sensitivity and at the same time a high under exposure latitude and a high developer resistance.",
        "It is an aspect of the present invention to provide a positive-working, heat-sensitive lithographic printing plate precursor which has an improved sensitivity and at the same time a high under exposure latitude and a high developer resistance.",

As soon as the coating is dissolved completely, no more weight loss is measured upon longer immersion time periods, i.e. a curve representing weight loss as a function of immersion time reaches a plateau from the moment of complete dissolution of the layer.

In a most preferred embodiment, the single-fluid ink comprises an ink phase and a polyol phase as described in WO 00/32705.",
        "Methods of Evaluation",
        "A suitable method for determining the energy density value for the practical exposure of a positive-working thermal plate will be explained hereafter. A halftone image is exposed on the plate at various energy density values and the actual dot area obtained on the plate, after processing according to the conditions (time, temperature, developer) used, is then measured by means of a reflection densitometer and compared with the target dot area that was set in the software (RIP) of the imagesetter. A typical example of such a method is shown in FIG. 1 wherein the dot area obtained on the plate, exposed with a 50% 200 lpi screen (about 80 lines/cm), is plotted versus the energy density of the exposure. The dot area values were obtained by means of a CCDot3 densitometer, commercially available from Centurfax Ltd. FIG. 1 shows that at low energy densities, the dot area on the plate is larger than the target value of 50%: it is believed that, due to the underexposure, the coating just around the edge of the dot does not dissolve sufficiently rapidly in the developer. At too high energy density values, the overexposure of the coating around the dot leads to dissolution of the edges of the dot, resulting in a dot area value that is lower than 50%. These effects are especially significant when the laser spot has a pronounced gaussian intensity profile and less with a steep intensity profile. From a curve as shown in FIG. 1, it can be established by interpolation at which energy density the obtained dot area coincides with the target value (50%): that value is referred to herein as the \u2018right exposure energy density\u2019 (REED). In other words, the REED value is defined as the minimum energy density at which the dot area on the plate, occupied by a screened image corresponding to a 50% halftone in the image data, coincides with the 50% target value. It is clear to the skilled person that a lower REED value indicates a higher sensitivity of the plate.",
        "Another parameter which can be used for quantifying the sensitivity is the clearing point (CP), which will now be explained. Exposure of a positive-working thermal plate at an energy density which is insufficient to raise the temperature of the coating up to the threshold value of the imaging mechanism has no significant effect on the dissolution kinetics of the exposed area. As a result, after processing according to the conditions (time, temperature, developer) used, the coating normally remains on the support, i.e. the optical density of the coating essentially equals Du, the optical density of the unexposed plate. At higher energy densities, the temperature in the coating approaches and eventually exceeds the threshold temperature and, as a result, the density of the coating that remains on the plate after processing decreases. The minimum energy density that is required to produce a reduction of the optical density of the exposed and processed plate coating by a factor of 95%, i.e. to produce an optical density of 0.05*Du, is defined herein as the \u2018clearing point\u2019.",
        "CP can be measured by exposing a solid wedge on the plate, i.e. a series of areas consisting entirely of 0% dots (full exposure at all imagesetter pixels) which are exposed on the plate at various energy density values. The method is explained with reference to FIG. 2 wherein these energy density values form a series of discrete values resulting in a step-wedge, but it should be clear to the skilled reader that the energy density values may also vary continuously so as to obtain a continuous wedge. A preferred continuous wedge varies by not more than 10 mJ/cm2 per cm wedge length. The minimum and maximum energy density for exposing the wedge should be adjusted to the particular type of plate that is being tested. The step-wedge used for the present Examples ranged from 30 to 300 mJ/cm2 with intervals of 20 mJ/cm2. The wedge was generated by the software that controls the imagesetter, although similar results can be obtained by other means, e.g. by placing a wedge filter in the light path of the imagesetter, preferably in contact with the plate. CP was determined by plotting the discrete values of optical density of the exposed and processed plate vs. the energy density as shown in FIG. 2 and establishing by interpolation at which energy density the optical density of the coating is reduced by 95%.",
        "In practice it is observed that the CP value is smaller than the REED. The Under-Exposure Latitude (UEL) is defined herein as the difference between the REED and the CP values, expressed as a percentage of the REED: UEL=(REED\u2212CP)*100/REED. A high UEL value is preferred because fluctuation of processing conditions, batch-to-batch speed variations of the plate precursor, etc., have no significant influence when UEL is high, i.e. when REED is large compared to CP. When UEL is low, shifts of the CP and REED values may result in an incomplete clean-out of the exposed areas, resulting in toning (ink-acceptance at the non-image areas).",
        "Finally, a fourth parameter suitable for characterizing the plate precursor of the present invention is the Developer Resistance (DR). DR is a measure for the resistance of the non-exposed areas towards the developer and is defined as (Do\u2212D2)*100/Do wherein Do is the optical density of the unexposed and undeveloped plate coating, and wherein D2 is the optical density of the coating of the unexposed plate after being put through the processor twice. A smaller value of DR indicates a higher developer resistance.",
        "Optical density values for measuring CP and DR were obtained by means of a GretagMacbeth D19C 47B/P densitometer, commercially available from Gretag\u2014Macbeth AG. Such reflection densitometers are typically equipped with several filters (e.g. cyan, magenta, yellow): the optical density was measured with the filter that corresponds to the color of the coating, e.g. a cyan filter is preferably used for measuring the optical density of a blue colored coating. All optical density values were measured with reference to the uncoated support of the plate.",
        "Preparation of the printing plate precursors.",
        "The printing plate precursors were prepared by coating the solutions defined in Table 1 onto an electrochemically roughened and anodically oxidised aluminium sheet (oxide weight 3 g/m2), the surface of which has been rendered hydrophilic by treatment with an aqueous solution of polyvinyl phosphonic acid, at a wet coating thickness of 26 \u03bcm and then dried.
