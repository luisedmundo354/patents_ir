An aperture or duty cycle of the gate clock signal determines which harmonic is rejected or suppressed, which is preferably a third and/or fifth harmonic since response of the balanced differential switching mixer to even harmonics is negligible.

        "The present invention is directed, in general, to mixing circuits for radios and, more specifically, to harmonic rejection for switching mixers.",
        "An architecture for high-performance direct conversion radios is disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/440,026 entitled \u201cCHOPPER-DIRECT-CONVERSION (CDC) RADIO ARCHITECTURE\u201d and filed May 16, 2003, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference. The architecture disclosed employs a phase-alternating mixer (PAM) that outputs a double-sideband (DSB) signal for use throughout the receiver circuitry. Such double-sideband signal paths eliminate the use of baseband frequencies that are generally problematic in large-scale circuit integration. In addition, problems associated with direct-conversion, such as local oscillator (LO) leakages, direct current (DC) offsets, low frequency noise and the like are all eliminated by relocating the local oscillator frequency away from the radio frequency (RF) employed for transmission.",
        "When harmonic or alias signals are presented to the input of the radio, these unwanted signals interfere with the desired signal and degrade the quality of reception. To improve receiver quality, a surface acoustic wave (SAW) band select filter might be employed before the phase-alternating mixer to reject the unwanted signals. However, a better approach would be to design both the harmonic and alias rejection functions into the basic mixer circuitry.",
        "There is, therefore, a need in the art for a harmonic rejection circuit that may be integrated into any type of mixer circuit, such as a phase-alternating mixer of the type described above.",
        "To address the above-discussed deficiencies of the prior art, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide, for use in a mixing circuit, rejection of local oscillator harmonic response with a pair of harmonic gating switches serially connected to the outputs of a balanced differential switching mixer and controlled by a gate clock signal having twice the frequency of a local oscillator signal controlling the switching mixer. An aperture or duty cycle of the gate clock signal determines which harmonic is rejected or suppressed, which is preferably a third and/or fifth harmonic since response of the balanced differential switching mixer to even harmonics is negligible. The resulting simple, efficient circuit is readily integrated directly into a phase-alternating mixer structure for a chopper-direct-conversion radio.",
        "The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention so that those skilled in the art may better understand the detailed description of the invention that follows. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter that form the subject of the claims of the invention.

Those skilled in the art will also realize that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form.",

Wireless communications system 100 may be employed for voice communications, video transmission or data transmission. Accordingly, receiver 102 may be a mobile telephone, a satellite or terrestrial television receiver, a data processing system such as a wireless personal digital assistant (PDA) with Internet access capabilities, or some combination thereof.",
        "Those skilled in the art will recognize that the complete structure and operation of a wireless communications system or a receiver therein are not depicted or described herein. Instead, for simplicity and clarity, only so much of a wireless communications system and associated receiver as is unique to the present invention or necessary for an understanding of the present invention is depicted and described.",
        "Receiver 102 preferably employs the chopper-direct-conversion architecture described above. Receiver 102 includes a circuit 104, preferably implemented in a single integrated circuit, receiving a wireless radio frequency (RF) signal on an input 105 from an antenna (not shown). The received signal is passed through filter(s) and low noise amplifier 106, then split into a differential signal and passed as dual inputs to a switching mixer 107 controlled by a local oscillator (LO) signal. A series-connected harmonic gating circuit 108 receives the outputs of switching mixer 107 and is controlled by a gate clock signal running at twice the frequency of the local oscillator. The output of the harmonic gating circuit 108 is passed through a channel filter and automatic gain control (AGC) amplifier(s) 109 to produce the baseband output signal at output 110.",
        "Mixers of the type employed in radio receivers may generally be categorized in two classes: multiplying mixers and switching mixers. Multiplying mixers simply perform a multiplying function where the output is the product of two input signals. Such mixers typically produce relatively low harmonic response, and therefore usually require no harmonic rejection circuit. Switching mixers, on the other hand, respond to odd harmonic frequencies because the local oscillator input is driven with a \u201charmonic-rich\u201d square wave. However multiplying mixers are costly, so switching mixers are gaining popularity in modern radios due to the superior linearity, simplicity and many integration advantages provided. For these and other reasons, the gated-switching mixer of the present invention employs the switching mixer approach.",
        "Harmonic response within a switching mixer is generally determined by three parameters: (1) band select filter response characteristics when a radio frequency surface acoustic wave filter is employed before the mixer as described above; (2) board parasitic and low noise amplifier/mixer high frequency roll-offs; and (3) mixer intrinsic harmonic response. Among those parameters, the radio frequency surface acoustic wave response characteristics are generally the most significant contributor to harmonic response.",
        "By way of example, FIG. 2 plots the input-to-output transfer response of a high performance radio frequency surface acoustic wave filter connecting the antenna output to a receiver with a nominal center frequency of 1.84 giga-Hertz (GHz). At 5.52 GHz, the first odd harmonic (equal to three times the center frequency), the surface acoustic wave filter provides a minimum rejection of 30 decibels (dB). When implementing high performance radios, however, that level of rejection (30 dB) together with other intrinsic rejections may fall short of the 70 to 80 dB rejection target. The gated-switching mixer of the present invention is designed to remove this pitfall.",
        "The addition of harmonic gating circuit 108 to a conventional direct-conversion radio architecture as shown in FIG. 1 utilizes a gating function to reject unwanted harmonics and forms the gated-switching mixer of the present invention. The gated-switching mixer is self-contained and may be employed in any direct-conversion, super-heterodyne radio, including the chopper-direct-conversion architecture with phase-alternating mixers described in the co-pending application identified above. With a slight modification, the gated-switching mixer depicted and described herein may be employed, as transformed, for up-conversion applications in radio transmitters.",
        "Co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/163,489 entitled \u201cHARMONIC REJECTION MIXER\u201d and filed Jun. 6, 2002, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses a harmonic rejection circuit utilizing a parallel mixing configuration. Due to the multiple parallel mixers, the harmonic rejection mixer disclosed in that application is capable of providing multiple nulls as several harmonic frequencies (e.g., the 3rd and 5th harmonics). The serial gating configuration of the gated-switching mixer of the present invention, which targets a low-cost solution, does not allow similar provision for multiple frequency nulls, and thus can reject only one harmonic frequency (e.g., either the 3rd or the 5th harmonic). However, rejection one harmonic is satisfactory for the chopper-direct-conversion phase-alternating mixer architecture.",
        "FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate timing waveforms for the response of a gated-switching mixer according to one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 3A illustrates application of the fundamental (i.e., transmission) frequency to the gated-switching mixer circuit of FIG. 2, while FIG. 3B raises the applied frequency to the 3rd harmonic. In both FIGS. 3A and 3B, numbers on the left of the plot identify particular traces. The first trace (1) on each plot illustrates a local oscillator (LO) signal controlling the switching mixer and having a frequency arbitrarily selected for the purposes of illustration to equal a normalized value of 15. The second trace (2) illustrates the harmonic gating circuit gate clock, which has a frequency=LO\u00d72=30 and an aperture in the example shown of 240\u00b0 (that is, the signal is high for 240\u2032 and low for 120\u00b0).",
        "The third trace (3) in each plot illustrates the antenna input, which for FIG. 3A is RF=(LO\u00d71)+offset=17, using an offset of 2, and for FIG. 3B is RF=(LO\u00d73)+offset=47. The frequency offset of 2 is added to the RF signal to create a beat frequency of 2 at the baseband outputs (traces 5 and 7, described below), enhancing the effectiveness of the illustration.",
        "Trace 4 illustrates the switching mixer output taken before the harmonic gating function, and is equivalent to conventional direct-conversion unfiltered baseband output. Trace 5 (the thinner of the two super-imposed traces) illustrates, for the purposes of comparison, a filtered version of trace 4 equivalent to the conventional direct-conversion baseband output\u2014that is, at the output 110 of the circuit depicted in FIG. 1 if the harmonic gating circuit 108 is removed and the outputs of the switching mixer 107 are fed directly to the channel filter and AGC amplifier(s) 109.",
        "Trace 6 illustrates a gated version of trace 4, taken at the output of the harmonic gating circuit and incorporating the effect of harmonic filtering. Trace 7 (the thicker of the two superimposed traces) illustrates a filtered version of trace 6, the final baseband output of a gated-switching mixer as depicted in FIG. 1. As apparent from FIG. 3B, the harmonic gating function is effective in attenuating the 3rd harmonic response (trace 3 in FIG. 3B is the input 3rd harmonic) to nearly zero (trace 7 in FIG. 3B, the output). However, the conventional direct-conversion baseband output (trace 5 in FIG. 3B) has a large output due to the absence of harmonic rejection.",
        "FIG. 4 is a plot of the harmonic response as a function of the harmonic gating circuit gate clock for a gated-switching mixer according to one embodiment of the present invention. The rejection frequency response of the gated-switching mixer according to the present invention is determined by the aperture width of the harmonic gate (i.e., the duty cycle of the gate clock controlling harmonic gating circuit 109). Since the aperture width is the only controlling variable, the gated-switching mixer does not have provision for inserting nulls at multiple frequencies in the manner of the harmonic rejection mixer described above.",
        "The harmonic responses of a variable duty cycle square (rectangular) wave gate clock signal for the harmonic gating circuit are plotted in FIG. 4. For the sake of clarity, FIG. 4 shows the duty cycle values only up to 55%. Values higher than 55% result in mirror images of the values from 0% to 50% (i.e., the values for 66.6% mirror those for 33.3% because 1-0.66=0.33).",
        "As shown in FIG. 4, when the gate clock signal exhibits a 50% duty cycle, all even harmonics are eliminated. In addition, the magnitudes of all of the odd harmonics follow the Fourier transform, such that the 3rd harmonic exhibits a magnitude of \u22129.5 dB, the 5th harmonic exhibits a magnitude of \u221214 dB, and so on.",
        "When the gate clock signal has a 33.3% duty cycle (high for 120\u00b0 and low for 240\u00b0), the magnitude of the 3rd harmonic becomes zero. Similarly, the magnitudes of the 6th, 9th, and all 3\u00d7nth (where n is any positive, non-zero integer) harmonics are also zero. Accordingly, the gated-switching mixer of the present invention adapts this property and applies a 33.3% duty cycle to the gate clock for the harmonic gating circuit to reject the 3rd harmonic (as well as the 6th harmonic, the 9th harmonic, etc.). It should be noted that aperture widths corresponding to duty cycles of 33.3% and 66.6% are identical from a spectral perspective.",
        "Since the gated-switching mixer depicted in FIG. 1 utilizes a fully balanced differential structure, the circuit does not respond to even harmonics. Thus the duty cycle of the gate clock is selected to reject the 3rd harmonic (or optionally the 5th harmonic instead). It should be noted that while nulls at multiple frequencies are not possible for the gated-switching mixer, selection of a 36.6% duty cycle results in a compromise suppression of both the 3rd and 5th harmonics at \u221219 dB.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates harmonic gating by two serial switches 108 connected to the output of the switching mixer 107. In alternative embodiments, the switches may be relocated to the input side of the switching mixer, or the gating signal may be coded directly into the local oscillator input to the switching mixer (i.e., modifying the LO signal to incorporate switching appropriate for the selected gate clock duty cycle). For high-speed applications, a parallel shunting scheme may be utilized in which the signal gating function is achieved by shorting the mixer outputs to ground through two shunting switches or transistors, providing a low circuit impedance level.",
        "In still another modification, a third \u201cdummy\u201d current path may be added to the existing two paths through the fully balanced differential switching mixer, similar to a Gilbert cell. When the harmonic gate is active (the mixer output is gated off), the differential currents through the differential signal pair in the switching mixer are totally branched off onto the additional current path, which gates off the mixer outputs without disrupting the circuit node impedances or other circuit parameters. Such an implementation would work well for high performance designs.",
        "The gated-switching mixer of the present invention is simple and effective, enhancing the harmonic response of virtually any type of mixer. Importantly, when the harmonic rejection feature of the gated-switching mixer is incorporated into a chopper-direct-conversion architecture, the resulting performance level surpasses currently available radio architectures.",
        "Although the present invention has been described in detail, those skilled in the art will understand that various changes, substitutions, variations, enhancements, nuances, gradations, lesser forms, alterations, revisions, improvements and knock-offs of the invention disclosed herein may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form."
