    "abstract": "Methods and systems for providing and managing training through/over networks to remote multimedia device users are disclosed. Training can be provided through networks to computers and portable hand held devices. Handheld devices can include PDAs, pagers, and wireless phones. Training can be received by a remote trainee through electronic data networks for completion at a wireless device. Methods and systems are also disclosed for managing remote training. Remote training can be tracked and recorded when completed by a remote user of a wireless hand held device. Completed training can be transmitted through an electronic network to course provider servers by a remote hand held device. Remote users authentication and certification of completed training received from a hand held device through an electronic network can be conducted by a training provider's server. Training providers can identify and/or authenticate users of completed instruction and training received from a hand held device and transmitted through an electronic network using biometrics. Completed training can certified by sending certification of training results to trainees and associated third parties. Certification can be provided via electronic means that can include e-mail receipt and/or automatic generation of paper-based communication (e.g., letter/certificate).",

        "The present invention claims priority to a previously filed Provisional Patent Application, Ser. No. 60/329,088, entitled \u201cMethods and systems for providing education, instruction and/or training through an electronic network to end user computers and/or hand held devices,\u201d which was filed on Oct. 12, 2001 and is herein incorporated by reference.",
        "The present invention is generally related to methods and systems for electronically providing education, instruction and/or training to remote end-users. Furthermore, the present invention is related to electronic methods and systems for managing remote training activities, including providing accreditation support to professionals, such as, for example, attorneys, accountants, doctors, engineers, nurses, and so forth. More particularly, the present invention is related to methods and systems for carrying out at least one of: remotely providing training, remotely completing training, registering users, authenticating users, managing remote training, and certifying completion of remote training. The present invention is also related to the use of wireless electronic hand held devices, such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), pagers, mobile phones and other data network-enabled portable wireless devices for providing and carrying out remote training.",
        "Today, seemingly more than in the past, companies are discovering that the general work force is ill-equipped and ill-trained, through a lack of formal training, prior work experience, or participation in apprenticeship programs, to perform necessary job-related tasks. Companies are also discovering that ill-trained workers fall into two major categories including a first category of workers who are new to a company's industry and who have none of the necessary skills to perform tasks of interest on behalf of their companies.",
        "In order to accomplish the task of providing training to employees, many companies send their employees to training programs, which are generally developed and conducted by an in-house training department or may be a function under contract to an outside firm to deliver company-specific content designed to meet company-defined training objectives. A company may also send its workers to training programs, conducted by outside firms or organizations that are designed to generically train employees of a certain industry in a particular subject or task associated with their employment.",
        "Regardless of who develops, designs, and/or conducts a training program, such programs typically require that an employee attend a number of training sessions at a selected training site. Unfortunately, the training site is often distant from the employee's normal workplace (particularly when the training program is conducted by an outside firm or organization not under contract to the employee's company) and the training sessions are often on days and at times that do not conveniently fit into the employee's schedule. As a result, the employee may have to travel between the training site and the workplace and may possibly have to stay overnight near the training site.",
        "By requiring the employee to travel and to attend training sessions on inconvenient days and at inconvenient times, the employee's personal and professional lives can also be interrupted, potentially upsetting or distracting the employee and reducing his/her ability to learn new skills. Additionally, the employee's company typically incurs direct expenses related to the employee's travel and indirect expenses associated with the opportunity cost of work not being accomplished while the employee is at the training site or while the employee travels to and from the training site.",
        "The professional ranks are also seeing a need for a more efficient means to undergo training. For example, Continuing Legal Education (\u201cCLE\u201d) had found its way to the Internet with well-known service providers such as LawyersLearn.com, Inc. LawyersLearn.com is currently delivering online continuing legal education to attorneys, whom are well known as a group to have limited time to attend live courses. Online CLE is a very reasonable alternative to live CLE seminars as a means for attorneys to complete their annual Minimum Continuing Legal Education (MCLE) requirements (required by most State Bars).",
        "Training material offered by typical training programs can generally include presentations by individuals having certain relevant knowledge or expertise, \u201chow-to\u201d demonstrations, and \u201chands-on\u201d training exercises. Such training sessions, especially if conducted without adequate company control, are often too long in duration and present too much training material, thereby causing many trainees to lose concentration and, otherwise, causing them to fail to comprehend and absorb the material. To make matters worse, it can be impossible to evaluate a trainee's comprehension and understanding of the training material provided in such training sessions without evaluation. Without feedback, it can be difficult to determine whether or not additional training is necessary and, if so, it can be difficult to conduct immediate reinforcement training. Furthermore, unless a training program is developed in-house or under contract, the content of such training sessions may include material not relevant to, or up to date with, the objectives of a company.",
        "Many companies have also attempted to overcome disadvantages associated with trainees having to travel to attend training programs by offering satellite-based instruction at the trainee's place of business. Unfortunately though, satellite-related equipment for satellite-based instruction is relatively expensive and is, therefore, often only available to a trainee in a specially equipped training room. As a result, the trainee must still leave his/her work site (i.e., desk, workstation, etc.) to perform training. Also, because a company may only have one specially equipped training room, the trainee generally must schedule use of the room or attend a scheduled satellite-based training session at time. Some companies have attempted to overcome this scheduling difficulty by recording the satellite-based training sessions on videotape for later playback. Unfortunately though, the use of videotape does not alleviate the need for a trainee to leave his/her workstation in order to travel to a specially equipped training room to view the videotape.",
        "With regard to the profession ranks, LawyersLearn.Com, Inc. is among a few CLE providers currently addressing the need for online training and education for busy legal professionals. But the legal community is not alone when it comes to training and educational needs. The medical, financial and technical professions also have a need for continuing education typically delivered through live training seminars, but which could be fulfilled through alternative, remote means.",
        "Computers have become pervasive in all aspects of the business and educational worlds. Computers allow for the generation, storage, retrieval, and interaction with data in useful ways. For example, business uses allow for large amounts of data to be correlated together in the form of databases or spread sheets that allow a user to categorize and view relationships more rapid than was previously possible without the aid of the computer. Computers have also allowed for the dissemination of information either to limited groups or to large audiences via such communication channels as local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and the Internet. Within this transmission of information, multimedia presentations have expanded to broaden the information dissemination and training opportunities available over LANs, WANs, and the Internet. The Internet has also provided interactivity where an Internet user is able to browse among various web sites for information. Upon finding a site of interest to the user, that site at times is able to glean information from the user that would be helpful for the web provider in a commercial or social context.",
        "Hand held computing devices (i.e., hereinafter referred to as \u201chand held devices\u201d or \u201chandheld devices\u201d) are becoming increasingly popular for storing and maintaining information. One of the first major advances in handheld mobile computer technology was the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). A PDA allows a user to access computer related information, yet it can fit into the palm of the user's hand. Utilizing a PDA a user can organize personal affairs, write notes, calculate equations, and record contact numbers in an address book. In addition, PDA's are usually capable of interfacing with a desktop computer, typically through a wired connection. The connection allows the PDA to download information and upload information, with the desktop computer. Later developments have given the PDA wireless capabilities. Wireless capabilities allow PDAs to remotely interact with other PDA's/computers that are not physically connected to the PDA.",
        "Although PDA's may be connected to a desktop personal computer or other PDA's via infrared, direct wire, or wireless communication links, PDA's and similar hand held devices can also be linked remotely to networks such as the Internet via local wireless resources, such as RF broadcasts or through available wireless communications techniques.",
        "The most advanced data- and video-enabled wireless communication devices currently available in the marketplace take the form of a PDA (e.g., Palm Pilot\u2122, Handspring Visor\u2122, and Windows CE compatible hand held computers, such as the iPAQ\u2122). Unlike personal computers, which are general-purpose devices geared toward refining and processing information, PDAs are designed to capture, store and display information originating from various sources. Additionally, while a certain level of skill is required to use a personal computer effectively, PDAs are designed with the novice and non-computer user in mind.",
        "The present inventor has recognized the convenience that online training and education is bringing to busy workers and professional since the advent of the Internet. The present inventor, however, has also recognized that vast improvements in wireless technology can further enhance current offerings in online education and current training applications that are primarily focused on a \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201cwired\u201d world, but physically connected systems and training application will also continue to experience an explosion of growth and improvement as more people begin to fully realize to positive impact that data networks have on everyday life.",
        "The present inventor has realized that, what is needed in the training field is an interactive process that enables wireless education, instruction and/or professional development via portable, wireless handheld computer systems. The current invention enables users of hand held computers wirelessly coupled to a network (e.g., Internet) to engage in training (e.g., via a multimedia presentation), be evaluated on the understanding gained by the user after the training (e.g., interactive questioning), and allow for reporting (e.g., certification of course completion) of the results of a user's activity and evaluation to a course administrator. Training data can also be used to verify, evaluate, and enhance training, course, student and/or teacher performance and/or development. Training data can also be used for not only for professional or technical development, but could also be used as credit towards certification or even college credit. The present inventor has therefore developed new methods and systems for providing and managing the provision to and execution of training by users via handheld wireless devices as well as improvements for use of fixed, networked computers (wired devices) already deployed and familiar in the field of online education and training.",
        "Use of the word \u201ctraining\u201d throughout the rest of this document should not be interpreted as limitation to the applicable scope of the present invention. Although the present invention is related to methods and systems for electronically providing education, instruction and/or training to end users, \u201ctraining\u201d will be used herein primarily to describe all forms of education, instruction and training that the present invention can broadly apply.",
        "The ability to obtain information from various users of a training system and report that information back to, for example, a supervisor, an instructor (such as a teacher or professor), principal, administrator, regulatory or accrediting body, or employer of the trainee, in a meaningful and helpful manner for evaluation review of the trainee's understanding of the subject matter has been lacking in the art of networked computer-based training until most recently. Further, the supervisor of many users may also be interested in knowing more about how long users took to review the information, how the users performed in the evaluation, what level of interaction users had with the training, how the collective group or groups of trainers are doing, and so forth.",

        "A useful aspect of WINs for the present invention is enabling the maintenance and use of customer profiles within an HLR/VLR-type database. HLR subscriber information as used in WINs includes identity, service subscription information, location information (the identity of the currently serving VLR to enable routing of communications), service restrictions and supplementary services/information. HLRs handle SS7 transactions in cooperation with Mobile Switching Centers and VLR nodes, which request information from the HLR or update the information contained within the HLR. The HLR also initiates transactions with VLRs to complete incoming calls and update subscriber data. Traditional wireless network design is generally based on the utilization of a single HLR for each wireless network, but growth considerations are prompting carriers to consider multiple HLR topologies.",
        "The VLR may also be configured as a database that contains temporary information concerning the mobile subscribers currently located in a given MSC serving area, but whose HLR may be elsewhere. When a mobile subscriber roams away from the HLR location into a remote location, SS7 messages are used to obtain information about the subscriber from the HLR, and to create a temporary record for the subscriber in the VLR.",
        "Signaling System No. 7 (referred to as SS7 or C7) is a global standard for telecommunications. In the past the SS7 standard has defined the procedures and protocol by which network elements in the public switched telephone network (PSTN) exchange information over a digital signaling network to effect wireless and wireline call setup, routing, control, services, enhanced features and secure communications.",

Once the training system has the user login to access the system. The login is verified before presenting instructional titles for view as shown in block 615. Once logged on, user is presented with and can choose from several training courses and other related materials as shown in block 620. The user can select a given title with an appropriate communications format (e.g., baud/bit rate) for viewing as shown in block 625, and the program can be downloaded or begin as shown in block 630. Timing of the training program can begin simultaneously with the training programs downloaded or stream (when streaming is involved).",
        "A login procedure is generally provided for the user where the user is asked to enter a password, login handle, biometric sample, or any combination of verification/authentication data. GUI representations of login screens and password fields are well known in the art. The user generally clicks on the SUBMIT button after filling in their information and the information is submitted to the server. The users equipment and the server performs a handshake operation to verify the access rights of the user based on the appropriate information provided by the user.",
        "The server can grant a user access to training through a title page (typically in HTML format) that can allow the user to select among the instructional segments or courses provided for use. Other optional features that can be provided to users include joining a chat discussion on the subject matter of a given course as well as providing a threaded discussion group for review and correspondence among fellow users.",
        "The course titles or options shown on device screens may be accessed or activated by highlighting the desired section with the cursor and/or clicking on underlined (e.g., HTML) lettering with cursor manipulation device, typically a mouse or a touch screen tap. Active titles can be hyperlinks to licensed media, such as a video segment. Unlicensed, or public, media can also be shown, either as hypertext or as plain text. Further, the user can be shown the length of time required to view each course or segment as well as whether the user has viewed the course or segment and whether the course or segment has been completed, which includes the evaluation or testing portion following the completion of viewing the segment.",
        "As described above, a user can select a course along with parameters that define the course by selecting a title, and can also select a communications means (e.g., streaming bit rate) for the program when applicable. For example, streaming bit rates depend upon the communications connection between the user and server. The user can inform the server what type of connection the user has and the server then optimizes the transfer of data based on the actual transfer rate established between the user and server. Of course the transfer rates can also be determined automatically during the connection protocol sequence used by the server and user's computer. Upon selection of a desired title, database/server begins transmitting information over the communications channel to the end user at an optimal or selected transfer rate.",
        "The invention will now be described with the continuation from where the user accesses the initial presentation screen. FIG. 7 illustrates a block diagram of a flow chart illustrating training sequences using a handheld device. A user can makes a training selection upon verification of the user by the system, as shown in FIG. 6. It can be assumed that the course has been successfully transferred to the device, or that an active communication channel has been set up. The course can begin, as shown at block 710. Prior to the commencement of the instructional material, preliminary questions or content points (orientation) for the user to review can be provided 720. This makes the user aware of what to observe during the presentation of the program. Additionally, the user can be given the option to print questions or points for review and awareness during the instruction portion of the presentation.",
        "The handheld system can present questions and content points to the user at the beginning as well as during a course. The system (or test software) can also require a post test and final information from the user before course completion. Questions and content can be provided as an interactive session, or can be conducted with the handheld device computing assets alone. Once the end of a course is reached, the user can review the material and complete post test questions, which may be in essay or multiple-choice format, or a combination of the two. The questions are then submitted for evaluation as shown in block 730. The information is received by the server 740 and saved for further use and/or evaluation.",
        "Training sessions are accessible by more than one user as shown in FIG. 6. More than one instructional leader or administrator can also access administrative sections of the enterprise system, after logging into the system. Administrators can use reports after performing a login and verification similar to that taught in FIG. 6, for access by trainees. The administrator can select reporting/certification or administrative sections of the system, based on authorization level. Reporting and certification selections can allow for access and control to test records and course completion certificates associated with users/trainees. The administrative section can allow for the manipulation (addition or subtraction) of training material and/or accounting records. After making a selection, a data summary is provided for a user's within the selected group. Assuming, for example, that an administrator selects one of the user's files for review of the user's exam. The administrator can provide feedback to the user and/or verify the user's completion of the selected instructional segment.",
        "Referring to FIG. 8, illustrated is a flow diagram for reporting and certifying methods in accordance with the present invention. Completed courses and information related to training or the user can be received from a user via networks, as shown in block 810. The user can be authenticated prior to further processing of received information as shown in block 820. Once information is received, it can be saved and/or evaluated as shown in block 830 The server can automatically determine as shown in decision block 840, whether the course is satisfactorily completed or not. If not, the user can be notified as shown in block 850. Of course it should be appreciated that other parties associated with the user can also be notified if relevant (e.g., an employer). If the course was satisfactorily completed, the user's results can be certified, reported or otherwise recorded as shown in block 860. Reporting can be generated in the form of emails sent to trainees and associated third parties (e.g., employers) regarding, for example, the trainees scores, class standing, completion status, etc. Reporting can include, for example, notifying the trainee of his or her results or that the user must review the material and complete the associated exam. An administrator can also use the system to assist in the remote evaluation of a user's understanding of the viewed materials, and to provide a report/information back to the user's or the user's supervisors in accordance with the principles of the present invention. It should also be appreciated that the system can be programmed to automatically score, track, report, and certify user activities. Certification and reporting can be directly to a user via email and/or to a user's supervisor, company, and/or regulatory/governing body (e.g., state bars or medical boards).",
        "Multimedia",
        "Referring to FIG. 9, an illustration of an example image (e.g., screen shot) of a segment screen 910 that can be displayed on hand held devices. The screen shot includes a video window 912, where video can be streamed for the user's review, as well as slide window 914 where text or still images can be presented to a user. A server 183 can stream training programs and information from databases 185 to the end user 191, 195, 196, as shown in block FIG. 5, where it can be displayed to the user in a format similar to that is illustrated in FIG. 9. Still images such as the text box 914 can be provided in coordination with the streaming video portion 912 of the instructional segment. The still images can be displayed in window 914 along side streaming video shown in window 912, using timing codes. Video controls 916 can allow the user to replay portions of the video, backtrack, pause, stop, or skip ahead as well as control the volume as needed. The timing of the video can be based on the URLs of the slides that are played, which can merely be one example of the timing that may be used. Another method to provide timing can be to cue the slides to the video, or even to be provided independently so the teacher or user can select the next slide when ready. Other navigational bars can allow a user to proceed to the NEXT screen 920 or go BACK 922 to the previous content/screen. Additional information regarding the displayed material, the example given being information on a particular professor, can be provided to the user 930 after his/her selection 920 (e.g., selection via displayed hypertext associated with the selection using a user interface). The text and graphics of this example are otherwise self-explanatory.",
        "Still images are an option that can supplement a training session or discussion as well as streaming video by highlighting important points in the instructional segment. Such points can include dates of interests, formulas relevant to the discussion, illustrative graphics, or lists of related matters for expanding understanding of a given subject, rules of law, medical principles and other supporting examples. Thus, after selecting a title, the instructional segment streams across the communications channel from the server to the user's computer. As the program begins to stream, a slide presentation can also be presented, which can be linked to the synchronized time code of the program and video. Instructions can also be provided to the user prior to the beginning of the video. The segment can contain questions that are presented at the end of the program, as well as questions that are featured at the beginning or during a training session in order to stimulate the viewer to be aware of specific strategies, theories, and applications. It should be appreciated that all instruction and supporting material can be provided in the form of a compressed data filed to the hand held device, rather than as streaming data segments requiring an active connection to a remote server. Such self-contained instruction delivery and use is generally only limited by the amount of memory available at the hand held device. Improvements in the hand held device and wireless communication fields should be anticipated, and will continue to enhance remote training systems and methods\u2014in particular those where hand held devices are used.",
        "Recording/Certifying/Reporting",
        "As mentioned above, methods and systems for certifying successful instruction and training completed through a hand held device can be carried out by sending course/training completion results to training authorities and/or course participants. Certification can be provided via electronic means that can include e-mail receipt and/or automatic generation of paper-based communication (e.g., letter/certificate). Administrative reports can be generated based upon a user's accessing the instructional segments in accordance with the present invention. Reports can be used to provide feedback to instructional leaders or administrators that, in an example of a teacher participating in a teacher development and enhancement program, includes the identity of the faculty member accessing the interactive training segment module, the duration of each faculty members time on line, and the results of the comprehension test/activity at the end of each segment or module. The information can further include access dates and times, IP addresses of devices used by trainees, assignment completion, status and exam/assignment verification. Administrators at all levels can use this data to verify, evaluate, and enhance staff development throughout their organizations. For example, in the case where a teacher is providing instructional materials on-line for students, the teacher can receive evaluation reports that can include useful evaluation information. For example, a teacher would eventually like to know how long each student spent on-line viewing the instructional material and how long each individual student took to answer the comprehension exam at the end of the segment. This would allow the teacher to gauge which subjects and concepts the class as a whole is struggling with as well as what subjects each student comprehends or information can allow a teacher to customize feed back to students, which can help students understand instructional content lecture materials for subsequent material that may follow.",
        "The feedback of the evaluation of the user's performance in answering the questions can be given via a direct email to a valid email addressed provided by the user or posted back to the user's personal access point entered via the password and login portion of the site. Of course, the results can be printed and mailed to the user as an option to provide the user with a validated hard copy. Once an instructional segment is completed, the user can be allowed to select another title to review or elect to log out of the system, thereby completing the instructional session. Furthermore, if a user fails to undertake training in a timely manner, reminders can be sent to the user via email, voice messaging, or a letter, to remind the user to complete the programs within the allotted time prescribed.",
        "Security and Authentication",
        "Referring to FIG. 10, a system for authentication of a trainee is illustrated. A training Provider that can identify and/or authenticate authorized users of: access to provider systems; access to ongoing training; and the provision of completed training. Authorized users gain access to the system via a hand held device 1025, and data is transmitted and received at the server 1005 through an electronic network 1010. Authentication of training can be by username and password procedures known in the art. Training/trainee authentication can also be by use of biometric authentication means, such as a digital file 1030 taken at the handheld device 1025 via a biometric measuring device 1020 (e.g., fingerprint reader). With biometrics systems, a digital file 1030 representing the user biometric can be matched with a biometric template file 1015 stored at, or accessible by, the server 1005. If the files match, the user is authenticated. Authentication can be used for authorizing all transactions, such as course ordering, and completed course submission.",
        "A biometric identification mechanism 1020 eliminates the weakest link caused by the human factor. Biometric identification mechanisms, or biometric devices, utilize a scientific technique to identify a user based on compared measurements of unique personal characteristics. Biometric identification mechanisms include two basic categories of biometric measurements. The first category involves measuring a unique characteristic found on a user's body. This may include, but is not limited to, finger and hand geometry, retina and facial images, weight, DNA data and breath. The second category involves measuring a user's behavioral characteristics. This may include, but is not limited to, voice, typing stroke and signature. In general, anything that can be measured on a user that is unique can be used as a biometric measurement.",
        "While anything that can be measured on a user that is unique can be used as a biometric measurement, the best biometric measurements to use for authentication purposes depend on the consistency over time of the biometric measured. For example, user weight is a biometric measurement. Because weight is a biometric measurement that fluctuates frequently for many people, it is not a desirable biometric measurement to use for authentication purposes.",
        "The general process of using biometric identification mechanisms as an authentication mechanism is as follows. The user is prompted for a particular biometric measurement that is used by a biometric device to generate a value. The value gets stored in a template as stored biometric data. When the user wants to gain access to a resource that is protected by the biometric device, the user is prompted for live biometric data. The live biometric data is matched with the stored biometric data. In reality, the live biometric data and the stored biometric data will never be exactly the same. Therefore, a user must come within some tolerance to pass the biometric device and gain access to the protected resources. As mentioned above, the biometric device utilizes a scientific technique to identify a user based on biometric measurements. The tolerance is typically predetermined by the vendor for the particular biometric device used.",
        "A specific example of how biometric identification works can be illustrated by a typical fingerprint device. A fingerprint device measures the geometry of a fingerprint. First, a user is prompted for multiple samples of a fingerprint. For each sample, a number of characteristics or measurements are identified. Then, for all of the multiple samples, a number of common characteristics or measurements are identified. The common characteristics or measurements are processed through a unique algorithm that generates a unique template to store the biometric data. When a \u201clive\u201d fingerprint is presented for identification, it is processed through the same algorithm. If the output from the \u201clive\u201d process matches the stored biometric data within a certain tolerance, the user is considered to be authenticated and gains access to whichever resource the fingerprint device is protecting.",
        "A specific example of how biometric identification works when behavioral measurements are involved can be illustrated by a typical signature device. Here, a user is prompted for multiple samples of a signature. For each sample, characteristics or measurements are identified. The characteristics or measurements include the pressure, sequence of events, direction, relative vectors and speed. One example of the sequence of events is to identify that when the user signed his or her signature, that \u201ct\u201d was crossed before \u201cI\u201d dotted. An example of direction is that the user crossed a \u201ct\u201d from right to left. Relative vectors may include the information that \u201cF\u201d is 2.1 the height of \u201ce.\u201d Finally, speed recorded is the time it took the user to sign a signature from start to finish.",
        "As with fingerprint devices, common characteristics or measurements are identified for the multiple samples. These common characteristics or measurements are processed through a unique algorithm that generates a unique template to store the biometric data. When a \u201clive\u201d signature is presented for identification, it is processed through the algorithm. If the output from the \u201clive\u201d process matches the stored biometric data within a certain predetermined tolerance, the user is considered to be authenticated.",
        "The use of biometric identification mechanisms as a means for authentication eliminates the forgetful user or unauthorized user access problems can occur through the use of passwords, tokens or smart cards. Because biometric measurements involve either a unique characteristic found on a user's body (e.g., fingerprint) or a user's behavioral characteristics (e.g., signature), it is impossible for users to forget or lose the mechanism of authenticating themselves. Now, it is impossible for User B to \u201csteal\u201d the mechanism of authenticating User A to the enterprise. Likewise, the practices of users sharing passwords and \u201cbuddy punching\u201d are eliminated.",
        "While the use of biometric devices can conclusively authenticate a user, the inventor of the present invention recognize that methods and systems are needed that utilizes biometric devices to provide effective authentication to training and education organizations engaged in training over a networked environment while not decreasing the productivity a network provides to service providers (enterprise) and customers (end users/trainees).",
        "Referring to FIG. 10, the present invention overcomes limitations that are typically encountered in online/remote training systems. With the present invention, user authentication protection is used in a networked training environment. The present invention can allow for the following benefits: (1) flexibility to use the right biometric measurement for a training environment; (2) allows trainee/user mobility; (3) flexibility in the degree of authentication required to protect the integrity of educational/training resources; (4) allows remote enrollment of trainees/users; (5) allows remote refreshing of trainee/user biometric templates; and (6) ensures the integrity of training materials (e.g., courses) and test results submitted for courses taken by trainees using remote computers over communication networks.",
