        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention generally relates to a cable connector type transceiver module having module connectors from whose backside a cable for balanced transmission is extended and is used to connect a HDD (hard disk drive) to a switching device in a RAID (redundant array of independent disks).",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a RAID. As shown in FIG. 1, plural HDDs 20 and a switching device 30 are disposed in a RAID 10, and each HDD 20 is electrically connected to the switching device 30 so that data can be transmitted and received between the HDD 20 and the switching device 30. Plural RAIDs 10 are disposed and each RAID 10 is connected to a server 40 via a network by Ethernet (registered trademark).",
        "FIG. 2 is a diagram showing a connection between the HDD 20 and the switching device 30. Since the distance between the HDD 20 and the switching device 30 is as small as one to two meters, conventionally, as shown in FIG. 2, the connection between them is performed by electric transceiver modules 50 and 60 and a cable connector 70 which uses a copper wire cable 71, instead of by an optical fiber.",
        "The electric transceiver module 50 has a thin and long rectangular parallelepiped shape and provides a control IC package 51, a card edge section 52 at one end, a connector 53 at the other end, and has a function to receive/transmit data. Similarly, the electric transceiver module 60 has a thin and long rectangular parallelepiped shape and provides a control IC package 61, a card edge section 62 at one end, a connector 63 at the other end, and has a function to receive/transmit data.",
        "The cable connector 70 provides the copper wire cable 71 and connectors 72 and 73 one at each end.",
        "The electric transceiver module 50 is inserted into a slot 21 of the HDD 20 and the card edge section 52 is connected to a card edge connector 22 of the HDD 20.",
        "The electric transceiver module 60 is inserted into a slot 31 of the switching device 30 and the card edge section 62 is connected to a card edge connector 32 of the switching device 30.",
        "The connector 72 is connected to the connector 53 and the connector 73 is connected to the connector 63.",
        "The transmission rate of data between the HDD 20 and the switching device 30 is approximately 2 Gbps.",
        "[Patent Document 1] Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2000-68007",
        "In a next generation RAID, the transmission rate of data between the HDD 20 and the switching device 30 becomes, for example, 4 Gbps or more. That is, the transmission rate becomes high speed. When data are transmitted at high speed, losses of signals in a transmission line become large.",
        "In the transmission line between the HDD 20 and the switching device 30, the losses occur at the connection point between the connector 72 and the connector 53, the connection point between the connector 73 and the connector 63, and entire long wiring patterns on printed circuit boards in the electric transceiver modules 50 and 60.",
        "Consequently, in the above connection between the HDD 20 and the switching device 30, the losses of signals become large at the transmission rate of 4 Gbps, and the transmission rate of 4 Gbps cannot be efficiently utilized.",
        "Accordingly, the present invention may provide a cable connector type transceiver module which can be used at high speed.",
        "According to the present invention, there is provided a cable connector type transceiver module. The cable connector type transceiver module includes transceiver module connectors disposed one at each end of a cable for balanced transmission which cable provides pairs of wires in which a pair of insulation covered signal wires is bundled, and the transceiver module connector has a transceiver module main body assembled in a housing. The transceiver module main body includes a printed circuit board which provides a card edge connecting section at the tip, plural pads for wire soldering near the card edge connecting section, and wiring patterns extending between the card edge connecting section and the pads for wire soldering, and a control IC package mounted on the printed circuit board. The pairs of wires of the cable for balanced transmission are extended in the card edge connecting section direction over the control IC package, and signal wires which the tips of the insulation covered signal wires are uncovered are soldered to the pads for wire soldering.",
        "According to embodiments of the present invention, the pairs of wires at the end of the cable for balanced transmission are extended in the direction of the card edge connecting section over the control IC package and the signal wires extended from the tips of the insulation covered signal wires are soldered to the pads for wire soldering at the position near the card edge connecting section rather than near the control IC package. Therefore, on the printed circuit board, the length of the wiring patterns between the card edge connecting section and the pads for wire soldering can be made short. Consequently, the cable connector type transceiver module can be used at the high speed of the data transmission rate.",

Next, in a process shown in FIG. 12(b), the inserting section 181 of the upper cover 180 is engaged under the bridge section 166 by causing the Y1 side of the upper cover 180 to face in the slanting downward direction. Further, the Y2 side of the upper cover 180 is rotated in the Z2 direction by setting the engaged point as the supporting point, and the upper cover 180 covers the opening of the housing main body 161. Then, the flanges 185 and 186 (FIG. 8) of the upper cover 180 are engaged in the flange 175 (FIG. 8) of the housing main body 161, and the upper cover 180 is strongly pushed in the Z2 direction.

In addition, the printed circuit board 121 is positioned in the X1-X2 direction by the side plate sections 163 and 164 (FIG. 8).

That is, first, the number of the connector connecting points is small; second, the length of the wiring patterns 127, 128, 127A, and 128A is as short as possible; third, a balanced transmission system is used for data transmission; and finally, the impedance of the signal route of the wiring patterns 127, 128, 127A, and 128A is matched to be 100 \u03a9. With this, high-speed data transmission of 4 Gbps between the HDD 20 and the switching device 30 can be realized. In addition, since the length of the wiring patterns 127, 128, 127A, and 128A is short, the length of the cable for balanced transmission 101 can be long. Therefore, the transmission distance where the high-speed data are normally transmitted can be long.",
