        "This application is a Divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/825,789, filed Apr. 16, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,046,741.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to transmission of information through media such as wire, cable, and radio-frequency propagation, both terrestrial and satellite. More particularly, the present invention relates to a single and multiple sinewave modulation technique, apparatus for modulating and demodulating information according to the modulation technique, and communications systems employing the modulation technique.",
        "2. The Prior Art",
        "Digital data is often transferred from point to point by exploiting one or more of the three characteristic properties of an AC signal: Amplitude, Frequency and Phase.",
        "Some of the modulation methods using the amplitude property are OOK (On-Off Keying) and common AM (amplitude modulation). In OOK a data bit is represented by the presence or absence of a carrier. In AM data bits are represented by a difference in the relative amplitude of the carrier or by using different tones representing the digital data to amplitude modulate a carrier.",
        "Typical modulation methods using the frequency property are FSK (Frequency Shift Keying and FM (frequency modulation). With FSK the binary states of digital data are represented with abrupt frequency changes between two predetermined fixed frequencies. In FM data bits are represented by a difference in the relative frequency of the carrier or by using different tones representing the digital data to frequency modulate a carrier.",
        "Phase modulation is also a common modulation method also but when used alone is difficult to distinguish from FM. Recently more sophisticated modulation methods have evolved and have been exploited. As an example a relatively new and popular modulation method is QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), which uses a combination of amplitude and phase modulation. There are several different variations of QAM depending on the application.",
        "Each of these modulation methods is viable, proven and used in appropriate communications applications. A few undesirable characteristics common to all of these modulation methods is they all require several cycles to transmit one bit and in doing so generate significant sidebands. These sidebands are necessary to extract the information from the carrier and take up significant bandwidth in the communications channel, requiring significant spacing between adjacent signals.",
        "A modulation technique according to the present invention employs one or more sinusoidal carriers. Digital data comprising a number of digital bits are encoded within each half of the sinusoidal cycle. Each individual one of n bits is located at a predetermined phase angle of the cycle \u03b8n. One digital representation (for example a \u201czero\u201d) is represented by no change occurring in the amplitude Y of the sinusoidal waveform at the phase angle \u03b8n. The other digital representation (for example a \u201cone\u201d) is represented by altering the sinusoidal waveform at the phase angle \u03b8n. Ax presently preferred, the sinusoidal waveform is altered by maintaining the amplitude Y=sin \u03b8n for a short interval \u0394\u03b8 following the phase angle \u03b8n. Alternatively, the sinusoidal waveform could be altered by increasing (or decreasing) the amplitude of the sinusoidal waveform and then maintaining the amplitude Y=sin \u03b8(n+\u03940) for the short interval \u0394\u03b8 following the phase angle \u03b8n.",
        "As presently preferred, but not necessary, every other bit is inverted (i.e., a \u201cone\u201d is inverted to a \u201czero\u201d and a \u201czero\u201d is inverted to a \u201cone\u201d). Either or both of the number of bits n and the phase angles phase angle \u03b8n may be adaptively altered or may be selectively altered for a number of purposes.",
        "In embodiments where a plurality of sinusoidal carriers are employed, the sinusoidal carriers may be related in frequency such that they may be generated having a phase relationship characterized by all of the carriers simultaneously being at zero degrees (sin \u03b8=0) periodically.",
        "A demodulation technique according to the present invention detects the modulated carrier and retrieves the digital data by examining it to determine whether the sinusoidal function of the carrier has been altered at an interval \u0394\u03b8 following each phase angle \u03b8n. For, example, if the carrier has been modulated by maintaining the amplitude Y=sin \u03b8n for a short interval \u0394\u03b8 following the phase angle \u03b8n, the modulated carrier is examined to determine if Y=sin \u03b8n during the interval \u0394\u03b8 following the phase angle \u03b8n or whether the amplitude has been following the function Y=sin \u03b8 during the interval \u0394\u03b8 following each phase angle \u03b8n. Such examination may be accomplished, for example, by mixing the detected sinusoidal carrier with a reference sinusoidal signal having the same frequency and phase as the carrier to detect phase differences between the reference sinusoidal signal and the modulated carrier, or by performing fast-fourier-transform (FFT) analysis on the modulated carrier. The digital data may then be buffered or otherwise processed and utilized as known in the digital data art.",
        "An exemplary modulation apparatus according to the present invention may be employed to digitally generate the modulated carrier. A counter may be used to drive a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter through a sine-function lookup table as is known in the art to generate a sinusoidal output voltage from the D/A converter. The output of the counter at points in time representing \u03b8n may be latched into the sine-function lookup table if it is desired to maintain the output of the D/A converter at the value Y=sin \u03b8 during the interval \u0394\u03b8. At the end of the interval \u0394\u03b8, the latch is released and the then-current-count output of the counter is presented to the lookup table. According to one embodiment of the invention, the bit rate is adaptable.",
        "One exemplary demodulation apparatus according to the present invention may be employed to extract the digital information from the modulated carrier. The modulated carrier is used to generate a reference sinusoidal signal having the same frequency and phase as the modulated carrier. The modulated carrier and the reference sinusoidal signal are mixed in a double-balanced mixer. Digital circuitry examines the output of the mixer during a time window including and just following the interval \u0394\u03b8 for a signal indicating a phase change between the modulated carrier and the reference sinusoidal signal. The sensed signals become the digital output stream of the demodulator.",

        "Referring first to FIG. 1A is a diagram illustrates an exemplary single sinusoidal carrier 10 modulated according to the techniques of the present invention. A positive half cycle of a sinusoidal wave is shown in FIG. 1A. The x-axis of FIG. 1A is the phase angle of the sinusoidal carrier 10 from 0\u00b0 through 180\u00b0 and the y-axis of FIG. 1A is the instantaneous amplitude of sinusoidal carrier 10 normalized to a peak value of 1 at a phase angle of 90\u00b0 as is known in the art. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate from an examination of FIG. 1A how the encoding of the second half cycle of the sinusoidal carrier 10 from 180\u00b0 through 360\u00b0 is performed.",
        "According to then present invention n digital bits are encoded within each half of the sinusoidal cycle. Each individual one of n bits is located at a predetermined phase angle of the cycle \u03b8n. One digital representation (for example a \u201czero\u201d) is represented by no change occurring in the amplitude Y of the sinusoidal waveform at the phase angle \u03b8n. The other digital representation (for example a \u201cone\u201d) is represented by altering the sinusoidal waveform at the phase angle \u03b8n. As presently preferred, the sinusoidal waveform is altered by maintaining the amplitude Y=sin \u03b8n for a short interval \u0394\u03b8 following the phase angle \u03b8n. As presently preferred, every other bit is inverted (i.e., a \u201cone\u201d is inverted to a \u201czero\u201d and a \u201czero\u201d is inverted to a \u201cone\u201d). Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that alterations of the sinusoidal carrier other than maintaining the voltage constant during the interval \u0394\u03b8 following the phase angle \u03b8n are possible in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. For example, the sinusoidal waveform could be altered by increasing (or decreasing) the amplitude of the sinusoidal waveform and then maintaining the amplitude Y=sin \u03b8(n+\u0394\u03b8) for the short interval \u0394\u03b8 following the phase angle \u03b8n. Combinations of these two techniques could be employed according to the present invention.",
        "In FIG. 1A, n is selected to be 4 solely for purposes of ease in illustrating the present invention. The present invention is not limited to encoding 4 digital bits per half cycle of sinusoidal carrier 10 and persons of ordinary skill in the art will observe that other numbers of bits may be encoded per half cycle of sinusoidal carrier 10. The locations of the encoded bits on the carrier 10 are shown at phase angles \u03b81, \u03b82, \u03b82, and \u03b84, respectively. These bit positions are shown in FIG. 1A symmetrically located. Such positioning, while convenient for performing the demodulation of the signal, is not necessary in accordance with the present invention.",
        "For purposes of FIG. 1A, a \u201czero\u201d data value is represented by no change occurring in the amplitude Y of the sinusoidal waveform and a \u201cone\u201d) is represented by altering the amplitude Y of the sinusoidal waveform. In the example of FIG. 1A, a modulation technique is used wherein every other bit is inverted (i.e., a \u201cone\u201d is inverted to a \u201czero\u201d and a \u201czero\u201d is inverted to a \u201cone\u201d). Therefore, bits 2 and 4 are shown inverted in FIG. 1A. While this modulation technique (inverting every other bit) is presently preferred, persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this is not necessary for practicing the present invention.",
        "FIG. 1A illustrates encoding the four-bit sequence 1000, in which bits 2 and 4 are inverted so that the encoded sequence is shown as 1101 encoded in the first half cycle of sinusoidal carrier 10. Thus, starting at phase angle \u03b81 and for a short interval \u0394\u03b8 following the phase angle \u03b81, the sin \u03b8 function becomes discontinuous and the Y value is held constant at the value Y=sin \u03b81. At the end of the interval \u0394\u03b8, the Y value jumps up to Y=sin[\u03b81+\u0394\u03b8]. Similarly, starting at phase angle \u03b82 and for a short interval \u0394\u03b8 following the phase angle \u03b82, the sin \u03b8 function becomes discontinuous and the Y value of the function is held constant at the value Y=sin \u03b81, since an inverted \u201c0\u201d (a \u201c1\u201d) is being encoded. At the end of the interval \u0394\u03b8, the Y value rises to Y=sin[\u03b82+\u0394\u03b8]. There is no interruption of the sin \u03b8 function at the angle interval \u0394\u03b8 immediately following phase angle \u03b83, since a zero is being encoded at that location. Finally, starting at phase angle \u03b84 and for a short interval \u0394\u03b8 following the phase angle \u03b84, the Y value of the function is held constant at the value Y=sin \u03b84, since an inverted \u201c0\u201d (a \u201c1\u201d) is being encoded. At the end of the interval \u0394\u03b8, the Y value falls to Y=sin [\u03b82+\u0394\u03b8].",
        "From an examination of the first and fourth encoded bits, persons of ordinary skill in the art will observe that the portions of the waveform at encoded bits at phase angles \u03b81 and \u03b84 are not symmetrical. At phase angles of less than 90\u00b0 the rise of the Y value is delayed and at phase angles of greater than 90\u00b0 the fall of the Y value is delayed. In both cases, however, the abrupt change in the Y value (\u0394Y) occurs at the end of the interval \u0394\u03b8, during which Y has been constant. This is the abrupt change that will be sensed by the detector to demodulate the signal and extract the digital information. As previously noted, persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that at phase angles greater than 90\u00b0 the abrupt change could be caused to occur at the beginning of the interval \u0394\u03b8 or that the abrupt change in amplitude could be at the beginning of the interval at phase angles less than 90\u00b0 and at the end of the interval at phase angles greater than 90\u00b0.",
        "A central portion of the sinusoidal carrier 10 symmetrically located around 90\u00b0 is identified in FIG. 1A by diagonal hatching. It is believed that, as a practical matter, there is some range of phase angles symmetrically located around 90\u00b0 for which the abrupt change \u0394Y in the value of Y will be difficult or impossible to detect since d sin \u03b8/d\u03b8 (i.e., cos \u03b8) approaches zero as \u03b8 approaches 90\u00b0 from both directions. This can be seen by comparing \u0394Y1 and \u0394Y2 and noting that the latter is a smaller amplitude change. It is therefore presently preferred to avoid locating the bit positions near the phase angle \u03b8=90\u00b0. The size of this exclusion zone will depend on factors such as, but not limited to, the detection scheme employed, the transmission medium employed, and the ambient noise level in the transmission medium.",
        "Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that variations of the modulation technique disclosed with reference to FIG. 1A are possible without departing from the concepts of the present invention. For example, this aspect of the invention has been disclosed with respect to use of a constant phase-angle interval \u0394\u03b8 to produce a resultant abrupt change in the value of abrupt change in the voltage value of Y. It is also contemplated to use a constant abrupt change in the voltage value \u0394Y with the result that the magnitude of the phase-angle interval \u0394\u03b8 will depend on the angular position at which the change in the voltage value \u0394Y is desired. In addition, the voltage during the interval \u0394\u03b8 in the example of FIG. 1A is held constant at the value Y=sin \u03b8n, but other functions could be employed.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 1B, a graph of voltage vs. time of both a single cycle of a sinewave carrier modulated according to the techniques of the present invention and of exemplary data detected from that carrier is presented. In the upper trace, a single cycle of a sinewave carrier is shown modulated with four bits per half cycle. In the upper trace, a representation is shown of the voltage that would be detected from that carrier using the techniques of the present invention. The absence of encoded data in the region symmetrical about 90\u00b0 is noted.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 2, a diagram illustrates another aspect of the present invention in which a plurality of sinusoidal carriers may be modulated with different digital data in the same communications channel according to the techniques of the present invention. In the illustrative example of FIG. 2, it may be seen that portions of seven sinusoidal carriers are shown within a 40 mS \u201cframe\u201d wherein all of the carriers are at a phase angle of zero at the beginning of each frame. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will understand that this can be readily accomplished by selecting carrier frequencies that are mathematically related in frequency. In the illustrative example of FIG. 2, carrier frequencies starting at 400 Hz and spaced apart by 25 Hz (i.e., 250 Hz, 275 Hz, 300 Hz, 325 Hz, 350 Hz, 375 Hz, and 400 Hz have been selected. As shown in the particular example illustrated in FIG. 2, the use of 16 bits per cycle results in a data rate of 1,456 bits per frame or 36,400 bits per cycle.",
        "As may be seen from FIG. 2, the carriers are mathematically related such that ten complete cycles of a first carrier, eleven complete cycles of a second carrier, twelve complete cycles of a third carrier, thirteen complete cycles of a fourth carrier, fourteen complete cycles of a fifth carrier, fifteen complete cycles of a sixth carrier, and sixteen complete cycles of a seventh carrier are contained within the frame. Such framing, wherein all of the carriers are at a phase angle of zero at the beginning of each frame, is not necessary for practicing the present invention using multiple carriers, but it may be advantageously employed for data recovery and other synchronization activities in a communications system according to the present invention. For example, the frame-start phasing illustrated in FIG. 2 may be used for synchronization purposes etc.",
        "This multiple-carrier aspect of the present invention can be employed to expand the total bandwidth that may be available in a given communications channel. For example, as will be disclosed herein, the bandwidth of a typical twisted-pair telephone line is about 3 KHz. According to the present invention, a plurality of sinusoidal carriers may each be spaced about 50-100 Hz apart in frequency within this frequency range and transmitted over the same telephone line. This can be used to significantly increase the usable bandwidth in any communication channel in which the present invention is employed. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize from this disclosure that other frequency separations will be useable at other frequencies. For example, at a frequency of about 100 MHz, a plurality of sinusoidal carriers may be spaced apart from one another by about 500 KHz. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will understand that, in any given system realized according to the present invention, the required carrier spacing is simply that necessary to avoid interference from adjacent carrier frequencies during detection and will depend on the frequency range utilized, as well as the detection techniques that are employed.",
        "According to another aspect of the present invention, secure communications may be accomplished by selecting combinations of two or more carrier frequencies. Authorized transmissions in such a system may be identified by receivers configured to detect the presence of the selected combination of carrier frequencies. According to one aspect of the present invention, communications systems may be adaptive and may use information sent over a control channel or frequency shifts detected by the receiver to shift the frequency of one or more carriers for purposes such as noise avoidance or minimization, security purposes, enabling multiple modes of communications, identifying messages intended for selected receivers, identifying events, etc. The purposes for which this aspect of the invention may be implemented will vary widely and are largely a matter of design choice.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 3, a block diagram depicts an illustrative modulator circuit for generating a modulated sinusoidal carrier according to the techniques of the present invention. The modulator of FIG. 3 is only illustrative, and persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other schemes, such as a programmed microprocessor and digital signal processing (DSP) techniques, state machines, etc., may be employed to perform this function.",
        "Generation of a sinusoidal voltage by use of a sine-function lookup table driving a D/A converter is known. The phase angles from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 are quantized to a number of discrete values. A multi-bit counter continuously counts through these discrete values at a constant clock rate. The output of the multibit counter addresses the sine-function lookup table that provides the digital encoded sine-function value for each quantized phase angle. The D/A converter outputs a voltage proportional to the sine of the discrete phase angle at the input of the lookup table.",
        "The two variables are the phase-angle resolution and the resolution of the A/D converter. In the illustrative modulator circuit of FIG. 3, the phase angle range of 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 is shown resolved to 9 bits, or one part in 512, making each increment of \u03b8=0.703125\u00b0. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other resolutions could be employed, although the number of bits that may be encoded in a half cycle of the sinusoidal carrier may be limited for smaller resolutions. For example, using a 9-bit resolution of \u03b8, each half cycle is resolved into 256 discrete angles. It is believed that a practical limit of 64 bits may be achievable using this angular resolution.",
        "Similarly, the resolution of the D/A converter should be selected so that the step size is small enough to provide a relatively low amount of distortion in an unmodulated sinusoidal carrier generated therefrom. It is presently preferred that the resolution of the D/A converter be at about 10 bits. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the resolution of the D/A converter will affect the ability to use FFT demodulating techniques, since it is desirable that the smallest contemplated \u0394Y be significantly larger than the D/A step size.",
        "Discrete logic elements are depicted in FIG. 3. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that these elements can be fabricated using different technologies such as bipolar technology, CMOS technology, etc., and that logic families such as TTL, ECL, etc., may be chosen depending on the speed requirements dictated by the operating frequencies for which the circuits are designed. Further, such skilled persons will understand that these elements may be integrated onto a single integrated circuit, or that these elements could be programmed into a programmable integrated circuit such as a field programmable gate array or that the logic functions performed could be realized as a state machine.",
        "In FIG. 3, clock generator 20 is shown driving 9-bit binary counter 22. The 9-bit count output from counter 22 is provided through delay element 24 to latch 26. Latch 26 is configured to be transparent while its clock input is low and to latch at its output the 9-bit value appearing on its input when its clock input becomes high. The output of latch 26 is used to drive sine lookup table 28. The output of sine lookup table 28 drives D/A converter 30. D/A converter 30 is shown in FIG. 3 having a resolution of 10 bits in FIG. 3, but from this disclosure, persons of ordinary skill in the art will understand that different resolutions may be employed. The modulated sinusoidal carrier of FIG. 1A appears at the output of D/A converter 30. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that, in the 9-bit counter example of FIG. 3, the frequency of clock generator 20 is selected to be 512 times the desired sinusoidal carrier frequency.",
        "Modulation may be applied to the sinusoidal carrier by temporarily freezing the input to sine lookup table 28 for a number of clock pulses whose periods together equal the desired time interval corresponding to \u0394\u03b8. Experienced digital designers will appreciate that there are numerous ways in which to accomplish this.",
        "One illustrative example of an extremely flexible method for performing this modulation technique is shown in FIG. 3 using non-volatile memory 32. Non-volatile memory 32 may be any sort of non-volatile memory, such as a mask ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory, etc.",
        "The 9-bit count output from counter 22 is also provided to the 9 least significant bits of non-volatile memory 32, which then has one location corresponding to each discrete phase angle into which the sinusoidal carrier is resolved. In the circuit of FIG. 3, memory locations in non-volatile memory 32 corresponding to phase angles in the ranges [\u03b81+\u0394\u03b8], [\u03b82+\u0394\u03b8], [\u03b83+\u0394\u03b8], and [\u03b84+\u0394\u03b8] contain the value \u201c1\u201d and memory locations in non-volatile memory 30 corresponding to phase angles outside of these ranges contain the value \u201c0\u201d.",
        "The data to be encoded is transferred to data input register 34. Data input register 34 is a parallel-in serial-out register. Data input register 34 is loaded with n bits of data, n being the number of bit positions that may be encoded into a half cycle of the sinusoidal carrier. Data input register 34 is falling-edge clocked by the data output of non-volatile memory 32. Prior to the first clock pulse, the first data bit appears at the serial output of data input register 34. When the output count of 9-bit counter 22 reaches the value corresponding to the phase angle location of the first data bit to be encoded, the output of non-volatile memory 30 presents a \u201c1\u201d value as previously disclosed. If the value of the first data bit appearing at the serial output of data input register 34 is also a \u201c1\u201d value, the output of AND gate 36 becomes true (a value of \u201c1\u201d). This latches the count of 9-bit counter 22 at the output of latch 26, causing the output of D/A converter 30 to remain constant. From an examination of FIG. 3, persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that delay element 24 is interposed in the output path of counter 22 to allow the output of nonvolatile memory 32 and the output of AND gate 36 to settle prior to the new count reaching latch 26.",
        "During this time, 9-bit counter 22 continues to count and its output sequentially addresses the contents of non-volatile memory 32. So long as the output of non-volatile memory 32 presents a \u201c1\u201d value to AND gate 36, the output of latch 26 remains latched. When the output of non-volatile memory 32 drops to a \u201c0\u201d value, AND gate 36 releases latch 26 and the current output count of 9-bit counter 22 is presented to lookup table 28, causing the output of D/A converter 30 to immediately rise (or fall) to the value of Y=sin \u03b8 for the current value of \u03b8 represented by the current output count of 9-bit counter 22.",
        "As previously noted, there are numerous ways in which to modulate the sinusoidal carrier by temporarily freezing the input to sine lookup table 28 for a number of clock pulses whose periods together equal the desired time interval corresponding to \u0394\u03b8. One advantage of employing the scheme shown in FIG. 3 using non-volatile memory 32 is that the positions of the data bits at phase angles \u03b81, \u03b82, \u03b82, and \u03b84, and the intervals \u0394\u03b8 can be collectively or individually adjusted simply by programming the contents of non-volatile memory 32. For, example, as previously disclosed herein, the lengths of intervals \u0394\u03b8 can be individually adjusted in order to cause substantially-equal \u0394Y changes for representing \u201c1\u201d value bits.",
        "Another advantage obtained by employing non-volatile memory 32, as shown in FIG. 3, is that the bit rate of the modulation may be selectively altered. Non-volatile memory 32 is shown including higher-order-bit address inputs 38 and 40, controlled by bit-rate controller 42. This example allows addressing four separate segments of non-volatile memory 32. Each segment may be programmed with data representing different numbers of bit-encoding phase angles, different intervals for \u0394\u03b8, or different combinations of both parameters.",
        "As will be appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art, bit rate controller 42 may be configured to adaptively and dynamically alter the bit rate and/or the intervals for \u0394\u03b8 modulation in response to changing conditions within the communication channel in which the modulator of the present invention is employed. As a non-limiting example, this technique could be used to negotiate connection speed over twisted-pair telephone lines as is done in present-day dial-up modems. Similarly, this technique may be employed to alter the bit rate of the modulation technique of the present invention in any communications channel in which it is employed to compensate for dynamically-changing conditions, such as noise, etc., in the communications channel.",
        "As will also be appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art, the bit rate and/or one or more of the phase-angle positions for \u0394\u03b8 modulation can be switched using bit-rate controller 42 and additional address lines to access other memory locations for other purposes. Such purposes include identifying synchronization frames, identifying packet headers for use in IP or other packet protocol systems, or identifying other events or conditions. In this manner, detection of \u201cout-of-position\u201d bits in received carriers can be assigned meanings such as identifying events, providing additional data, etc. These meanings may change depending on where in a \u201cframe\u201d this activity occurs.",
        "The nature of bit-rate controller 42 will depend to a large extent on the nature and architecture of the system in which the modulator is disposed and on the conditions that will be used to alter the bit rate or the bit phase-angle positions. As an example, bit-rate controller 42 could be configured as a state machine, a microcontroller or a microprocessor. Configuration of the state machine and/or programming of the microcontroller or microprocessor will, of course, depend on the exact process that is being performed and is a routine task for a person of ordinary skill in the art.",
        "As a general example, however, bit-rate controller may be conditioned to sense the presence of a condition, request, interrupt, event, or the like, and assert an address to a location in memory 32 that contains the data to produce the number of bits desired and/or set one or more bit positions at desired phase angles of the sinusoidal carrier to effect the specific response to the condition, request, interrupt, event, or the like. If additional data is being encoded, one phase-angle setting of the bit positions in the sinusoidal carrier can represent a first digital state (e.g., a \u201czero\u201d) and a second phase-angle setting of the bit positions in the sinusoidal carrier can represent a second digital state (e.g., a \u201cone\u201d).",
        "A receiver for demodulating the modulated sinewaves of the present invention may be conditioned to detect one or more \u201cout-of-position\u201d bits in one or more carriers and perform different actions based upon the detection and the meanings assigned to the condition. One advantage of employing this technique according to the present invention is that this may be accomplished while still utilizing the detected data, meaning that this increase in function may be obtained without degrading the bandwidth of the communications channel. For example, a carrier presenting \u201cout-of-position\u201d encoded bits could be used to signal that the system is about to increase or decrease the number of carriers in the channel. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the uses for this additional intelligence capability of the present invention are virtually limitless and are adaptable to the particular configuration and end use of the system in which they are employed.",

Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the number of such sequencer state machines used in an actual realization of the present invention is arbitrary and six are shown only as an illustrative example.

The clock causes the sequencer state machines 66-1 through 66-6 to sequence through the addresses to produce a sinewave signal from the LUTs 68-1 through 68-6. When a data bit is present and at the right phase location of the sinewave the sequencer will cause its associated LUT to delay its output cause a elemental phase change in its output. The reset, when asserted, brings each sequencer state machine back to a known state.",

        "There are numerous schemes that may be employed to distribute the data from data buffer 64 to distribute the data to sequencer state machines 66-1 through 66-6. As previously noted, the data rate for each of sequencer state machines 66-1 through 66-6 will be different.",
        "One exemplary way to distribute the data is to distribute each bit in turn to the one of sequencer state machines 66-1 through 66-6 that is going to encode the next bit. This method may be referred to herein as \u201cstreaming\u201d and has the advantage that it requires no reassembly of the data at the receiver since the data is in the form of a simple serial data stream. This timing may be derived as a matter of simple mathematics once a system design is specified and the number and frequencies of the carriers is determined. The details of gating of the data to the appropriate one of sequencer state machines 66-1 through 66-6 from a data distributor according to a known sequence is a matter of routine digital circuit design. With reference again to FIG. 2 as an example, and assuming that 4 bits will be encoded into each half cycle of each sinewave carrier, the absolute position in time for each angular position of phase angles \u03b81, \u03b82, \u03b82, and \u03b84 can be easily calculated for each sinewave carrier in a single frame. Each of these times, and the one of the sinewave carriers with which it is associated, may be used by the controller 62 to distribute the next data bit to the appropriate one of sequencer state machines 66-1 through 66-6.",
        "Another exemplary way to distribute the data is, for each frame, to allocate to each one of sequencer state machines 66-1 through 66-6 a block of data having a number of bits equal to the number of bits that sequencer will encode in the current frame. This information is known once a system design is specified and the number and frequencies of the carriers is determined. In the example of FIG. 2, Table 1 shows the number of bits that will be used per frame for each carrier.",

        "As will be appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art, depending on the complexity of the data distributing on the encoding end, this data distribution scheme might be constrained in that it may not be possible to accommodate extremely fast data rates on the receiving end because the data distributor has to wait for the data blocks of each carrier to be filled prior to the blocks being ready for release.",
        "The outputs of the LUTs 68-1 through 68-6 are presented to D/A converters 70-1 through 70-6, respectively. The D/A converters 70-1 through 70-6 linearly and continuously convert the parallel 8-bit digital byte from the LUTs 68-1 through 68-6 to the input of the summing amplifier 72. The summing amplifier 72 is a conventional configuration of a circuit using an operational amplifier to linearly add several individual analog signals together to produce one composite signal.",
        "A demodulation technique according to the present invention detects the modulated carrier and examines it to determine whether the sinusoidal function of the carrier has been altered at an interval \u0394\u03b8 following each phase angle \u03b8n. For, example, if the carrier has been modulated by maintaining the amplitude Y=sin \u03b8n for a short interval \u0394\u03b8 following the phase angle \u03b8n, the modulated carrier is examined to determine if Y=sin \u03b8n during the interval \u0394\u03b8 following the phase angle \u03b8n or whether the amplitude has been following the function Y=sin \u03b8 during the interval \u0394\u03b8 following each phase angle \u03b8n. Such examination may be accomplished, for example, by mixing the detected sinusoidal carrier with a reference sinusoidal signal having the same frequency and phase as the carrier to detect phase differences between the reference sinusoidal signal and the modulated carrier, or by performing fast fourier transform (FFT) analysis on the modulated carrier. Such a demodulator may also contain circuitry to detect \u201cout-of-position\u201d bits disposed in one or more of the carriers.",

First, the incoming modulated sinusoidal carrier is presented to signal input conditioning block 80. The nature of the circuitry inside signal input conditioning block 80 will depend upon the transmission medium used in the communication channel. For example, if the transmission medium is a twisted pair cable such as would be encountered in a telephone network, signal input conditioning block 80 may be formed from a differential line receiver. If the transmission medium is a radio or microwave transmitter, as may be encountered in a wireless or satellite communications system, the signal input conditioning block 80 may consist of the usual RF and IF front end circuitry, including antennas, RF amplifiers, down converters, and RF detectors if applicable to the RF system used.",

The signal from the narrow bandpass filter 82 is amplified in amplifier 84 and presented to one side of double-balanced mixer 86. The other side of double-balanced mixer 86 is fed by the output of numerically-controlled oscillator (NCO) 88. The frequency and phase of NCO 88 is set to the frequency and phase of the one of the modulated sine waves within the passband of bandpass filter 82.",

Referring now to FIG. 7, a block diagram shows an input line 90 driving a plurality of a plurality of illustrative balanced mixers 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, and 102. Six balanced mixers are shown in FIG. 7, but persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand that any number of balanced mixers could be used depending on how many different-frequency modulated sinewaves were generated by the modulator circuitry of FIG. 5A.",
        "Balanced mixers 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, and 102 are also driven from the outputs of NCO multi-sine wave generator 104.

The outputs of balanced mixers 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, and 102 are combined into a serial or parallel output data stream in data convoluter 106 according to known techniques.",
        "Data convoluter 106 reassembles the digital data from the individual modulated sinewaves.

The data in the 1 Khz carrier is arriving at a rate of n bits per 1 mSec. The data in the 3 Khz carrier is arriving at three times that rate. Reassembly of the data from the different carriers is not much different from reassembling packet data in an IP packet network. Various known techniques can be employed. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the details of the reassembly process will vary as a function of the manner in which the data was divided among the several carriers in a multi-carrier system.",
        "According to one aspect of the invention, one carrier could be employed to carry control information necessary for one or more aspects of the communication, or a combination of control information and data. Depending on the amount of control information required in a communications channel, the control information may be encoded in the carrier having the lowest data rate (i.e., 1 KHz carrier in the example above), the highest data rate (i.e., 3 KHz carrier in the example above), or in one of the other carriers.",

This demodulator operates by driving a moving dot LED display, where the illuminated dot represents the level of the received modulated sinewave. Because the voltage of the unmodulated portions of the sinewave carrier and portions of the carrier modulated with a zero bit (such as shown at phase angle \u03b84 of FIG. 1A), changes fairly rapidly while the voltage level at portions of the carrier modulated with a one bit (such as shown at phase angle \u03b84 of FIG. 1A) stays constant for a longer period, the LED corresponding to the voltage level starting at phase angle \u03b84 of FIG. 1A will be brighter for a longer time.

        "Yet another communications system according to the present invention employs a modulator to generate at least one modulated carrier according to the present invention and to further modulate a radio-frequency (RF) carrier with the at least one modulated carrier to form a wireless RF signal. The modulated carriers may be up-converted in frequency prior to being RF modulated. Preferably, a plurality of such modulated carriers, separated in frequency by a guard-band amount, are RF modulated. The RF modulated signal is then transmitted to an earth-orbiting or other satellite or spacecraft. A demodulator is coupled to the RF receiver in the earth-orbiting or other satellite or spacecraft. The earth-orbiting or other satellite or spacecraft may then retransmit the RF signal to another RF receiver or may demodulate it for local use.
