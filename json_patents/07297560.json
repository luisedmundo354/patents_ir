No. 60/422,510, filed Oct. 31, 2002, and is related to co-pending application 60/422,511, entitled \u201cMethod and apparatus for determining an etch property,\u201d filed on Oct. 31, 2002. The contents of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for plasma processing a substrate, and more particularly to an improved method for determining an endpoint during a plasma etch process.",
        "2. Discussion of the Background",
        "Typically, during semiconductor processing, a (dry) plasma etch process is utilized to remove or etch material along fine lines or within vias or contacts patterned on a silicon substrate. The plasma etch process generally involves positioning a semiconductor substrate with an overlying patterned, protective layer, for example a photoresist layer, into a processing chamber. Once the substrate is positioned within the chamber, an ionizable, dissociative gas mixture is introduced within the chamber at a pre-specified flow rate, while a vacuum pump is throttled to achieve an ambient process pressure. Thereafter, a plasma is formed when a fraction of the gas species present are ionized by electrons heated via the transfer of radio frequency (RF) power either inductively or capacitively, or microwave power using, for example, electron cyclotron resonance (ECR). Moreover, the heated electrons serve to dissociate some species of the ambient gas species and create reactant specie(s) suitable for the exposed surface etch chemistry.",
        "Once the plasma is formed, selected surfaces of the substrate are etched by the plasma. The process is adjusted to achieve optimal conditions, including an appropriate concentration of desirable reactant and ion populations to etch various features (e.g., trenches, vias, contacts, etc.) in the selected regions of substrate. Such substrate materials where etching is required include silicon dioxide (SiO2), low-k dielectric materials, poly-silicon, and silicon nitride. As the feature size shrinks and the number and complexity of the etch process steps used during integrated circuit (IC) fabrication escalate, the requirements for tight process control become more stringent.",
        "Consequently, real time monitoring and control of such processes becomes increasingly important in the manufacture of semiconductor ICs. For example, one such monitoring and control diagnostic necessary for the timely completion of an etch step or process is endpoint detection. Endpoint detection refers to the control of an etch step and, in particular, to the detection of the feature etch completion or the instant in time when the etch front reaches the etch stop layer. If the etch process endpoint is improperly detected, then severe under-cutting of the feature may occur due to over-etching or partially complete features may result due to under-etching. As a result, poor endpoint detection could lead to devices of poor quality that are subject to increased risk of failure. Therefore, the accurate and precise completion of an etch process is an important area for concern during the manufacturing process.",
        "One approach used for endpoint detection is to monitor the emission intensity of light at a pre-specified wavelength in time using optical emission spectroscopy (OES). Such a method might identify a wavelength corresponding to a chemical species present in the etch process that shows a pronounced transition at the etch process endpoint. Subsequently, a resultant signal is analyzed to detect distinct variations in the emission intensity, and the analysis of the resulting signal is then used to correlate with the completion of an etch process. Typically, the species selected corresponds to a reactive species or a volatile etch product. For example, the selected wavelength may correspond to CO* emission when etching SiO2 and polymer films, N2* or CN* emission when etching nitride films, SiF* emission when etching poly-silicon and AlCl* emission when etching aluminum.",
        "In addition to the approach of monitoring the emission intensity at a single wavelength as described above, another approach is to monitor the light intensity at two wavelengths and record the ratio (or some mathematical manipulation thereof) of the two intensities. For instance, one wavelength is chosen for a specie whose concentration decays at an endpoint and a second wavelength is chosen for a specie whose concentration increases at the endpoint. Therefore, the ratio gives improved signal to noise.",
        "The present invention provides a method for determining an endpoint during an etch process, wherein the method advantageously address the above-identified shortcomings.",

TMPs are useful for low pressure processing, typically less than 50 mTorr. At higher pressures, the TMP pumping speed falls off dramatically. For high pressure processing (i.e., greater than 100 mTorr), a mechanical booster pump and dry roughing pump can be used. Furthermore, a device for monitoring chamber pressure (not shown) can be coupled to the plasma processing chamber 10.

The design and implementation of an upper electrode is well known to those skilled in the art.",
        "In the illustrated embodiment, shown in FIG. 5, the plasma processing system of FIG. 1 can, for example, further comprise an inductive coil 80 to which RF power is coupled via RF generator 82 through impedance match network 84. RF power is inductively coupled from inductive coil 80 through dielectric window (not shown) to plasma processing region 45. A typical frequency for the application of RF power to the inductive coil 80 can range from 10 MHz to 100 MHz and is preferably 13.56 MHz. Similarly, a typical frequency for the application of power to the chuck electrode can range from 0.1 MHz to 30 MHz and is preferably 13.56 MHz.

        "Alternately, the plasma can be formed using electron cyclotron resonance (ECR). In yet another embodiment, the plasma is formed from the launching of a Helicon wave. In yet another embodiment, the plasma is formed from a propagating surface wave. Each plasma source described above is well known to those skilled in the art.",
        "Referring again to FIGS. 1 through 5, diagnostic system 12 can be an optical diagnostic that is utilized to measure the irradiance, or spectral irradiance, of light emitted from the plasma. For example, FIG. 6 presents an exemplary endpoint signal 100 for light of a given wavelength emitted from plasma in the process space 15. The endpoint signal 100 can further comprise an endpoint transition 110, wherein a distinct change in endpoint signal 100 signifies endpoint. For example, light emission corresponding to a specific chemical constituent present during the etch reaction, that either decays (as in FIG. 6) or increases in concentration (and, hence, spectral irradiance) during endpoint, can be selected for monitoring purposes.",
        "By inspection of the endpoint signal 100 in FIG. 6, endpoint can be determined to occur at a start time 112 of the endpoint transition 110, an end time 114 of the endpoint transition 110, or an inflection time 116 of the endpoint transition 110 corresponding to the inflection point in endpoint transition 110. Alternately, a first derivative 118 of the endpoint signal 100 can be computed, and the maximum (in negative slope) of the first derivative 118 of the endpoint transition 110 can be utilized for determining endpoint. Alternately, a second derivative (not shown) of the endpoint signal 100 can be computed, and a zero crossing can be utilized for determining endpoint.",
        "Alternatively, endpoint can be determined from two or more signals from optical diagnostic 12, such as endpoint signals 100A and 100B shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, respectively. Endpoint signal 100A can, for example, correspond to emission from a chemical constituent whose concentration decays during endpoint, and endpoint signal 100B can, for example, correspond to emission from a chemical constituent whose concentration rises during endpoint. Referring to FIGS. 7C and 7D, one or more ratio signals can then be determined from the two or more endpoint signals (100A, 100B). For example, a ratio signal 130 (FIG. 7C) can be determined by dividing endpoint signal 100A by endpoint signal 100B at each instant in time. Furthermore, one or more differential signals can be determined from the one or more ratio signals. For example, a differential signal 140 (FIG. 7D) determined from a first derivative of the ratio signal 130. The first derivative can be estimated using a first order (forward or backward) difference scheme, or a second order (central) difference scheme. As described above, an endpoint can be determined from the inflection time corresponding to the inflection point in ratio signal 130 or the maximum 142 (in negative slope) of the differential signal 140.",
        "However, the endpoint signal, as depicted in FIG. 6 (100) and FIGS. 7A and 7B (100A, 100B), can be subject to noise and, hence, in some cases the signal-to-noise ratio can be low. Typically, the signal-to-noise ratio can be low when noise, inherent to the plasma processing system, is imposed on the endpoint signal. For example, referring to FIG. 3, the plasma processing system 1 can comprise a transverse magnetic field B, formed by the magnetic field system 60, that is substantially perpendicular to the respective electric field E established by the electrical bias applied to the substrate holder 20. As a result of EXB drift, electrons in the plasma can drift to the side of the process region 15 in the direction of the cross product of the electric E and magnetic B fields. Subsequently, an increased plasma density is observed in this location of the process region 15. When the magnetic field, generated by the magnetic field system 60, is rotating, the off-center peak in plasma density is rotated through the process region 15. As a result of this rotation in the plasma, the diagnostic system 12 observes a periodic fluctuation in intensity, such as when using optical emission spectroscopy (OES).",
        "For example, FIGS. 8A and 8B present typical raw endpoint signals 101A, 101B, and corresponding smoothed endpoint signals 150A, 150B that are computed using a moving average. The fluctuations 102A and 102B in the endpoint signals 101A and 101B correspond to the effect the rotating magnetic field has on the plasma in process space 15. The frequency of the fluctuation 102A and 102B are associated with the rotation frequency of the magnetic field.",
        "In the case where one or more endpoint signals and a first derivative of a subsequent signal (such as a ratio signal) are used, it is necessary to impose some smoothing (or filtering) of the signals during post-processing in order to alleviate the above identified noise and identify an endpoint. However, in order to achieve accurate endpoint detection, the post-processing steps utilized must preserve the dynamic range of variations embedded within the endpoint signal(s).",
        "A method to reduce noise in a one-dimensional stream of data (e.g. time-series, spectrum), and retain the dynamic range of variations in the data is to apply a least squares smoothing polynomial filter, also referred to as the Savitzky-Golay (SG) finite impulse response (FIR) smoothing filter, cf. Numerical Recipes (Press et al. 1992, Sec. 14.8) (the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). In general, the SG filters out-perform standard averaging FIR filters, which tend to remove a significant portion of the signal's high frequency content along with the noise. SG filters are typically employed to remove noise from a signal comprising a broadband frequency spectrum, and they are optimal in the sense that they minimize the least squares error in fitting a polynomial to windows of data. The low-pass filter coefficients of the SG filter are computed by effectively least-squares fitting a polynomial in a moving window, centered on each data point, so that the new value for each data point will be the zeroth coefficient of the polynomial. Approximate first derivatives of the data can be computed by using the first order coefficient of each polynomial, and so on. The filter coefficients for a specified polynomial order and filter window width are computed independent of any data, and stored. Thereafter, the SG filter is convolved with the data to provide a smoothed data stream with reduced noise, however, retaining higher order variations. The utilization of other smoothing techniques, such as moving averages, does not preserve the higher order variations in the data stream. Algorithms implementing SG filters for post-processing data are commercially available through MATLAB, available from The Mathworks, Inc. (3 Apple Hill Drive, Natick, Mass. 01760-2098).",
        "Referring again to FIGS. 7A and 7B, endpoint signals 100A and 100B are smoothed using running averages, and the differential signal 140 (FIG. 7D) is computed from the ratio signal 130 (FIG. 7C) using simple differencing and additional smoothing. As a consequence, the time duration 144 of the endpoint transition is unduly broadened and the peak 142 of the endpoint transition is offset to a later time.",
        "In order to illustrate the advantages of the SG filter, FIGS. 9A1-9D1 present a number of manipulations of the endpoint signals 150A and 150B (FIGS. 8A and 8B) using various post-processing techniques. Ratio signal 130 (FIG. 9A1) comprises a ratio of the smoothed endpoint signals 100A and 100B of FIGS. 7A and 7B, wherein the smoothing is imposed using moving averages. Differential signal 160 (FIG. 9A2) represents a simple difference of the ratio signal 130. The time duration and peak of the endpoint transition are captured within differential signal 160, however, they are immersed within the noise remnants not removed during the smoothing of the raw endpoint signals.",
        "Differential signal 162 (FIG. 9B1) represents a moving average of differential signal 160 (using a moving window of 29 data points). From inspection of differential signal 162, the time duration of the endpoint transition is expanded and the peak of the endpoint transition is shifted to a greater time relative to differential signal 160. Differential signal 164 (FIG. 9B2) represents the application of a finite impulse response (FIR) filter to differential signal 162 and, by inspection, the broadening of the time duration and the shifting of the peak are exacerbated.",
        "Differential signal 166 (FIG. 9C1) represents the application of a Savitsky Golay (SG) filter to the ratio signal 130 using a second degree polynomial fit and a filter window width of 11 data points. By inspection, the performance relative to differential signal 160 is improved; however, noise still remains on the signal. Differential signal 168 (FIG. 9C2) further smooths differential signal 166 by imposing a moving average; however, it suffers from some of the above identified problems.",
        "Differential signal 170 (FIG. 9D1) represents the application of a SG filter to the ratio signal 130 using a first degree polynomial fit and a filter window of 29 data points. The resultant signal is considerably improved, with regards to the time duration of the endpoint transition and the peak of the endpoint transition, and, by inspection, compares favorably with differential signal 160.",
