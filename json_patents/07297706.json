Chem. 1996, 61, 3548-3550) in THF (0.3 M) is treated with a sodium thioalkoxide (1.1 eq). After stirring for 30 min, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stir for an additional 2-3 h, before it is acidified with 10% aqueous sodium bisulfate solution. The aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate twice, and the combined organic layers are dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo.

Either HOBt or HOAt (approximately 1 eq) and either EDCI or DCC (approximately 1 eq) are separately stirred together in a solvent; and the resulting mixture is added to the other solution, or vice versa. After stirring overnight at room temperature, the solvents may be removed; and then the mixture is diluted with an organic solvent (such as ethyl acetate or dichloromethane) and washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate followed by brine. The organic solution is then dried with MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo.

The SCX column is washed with a 5% solution of acetic acid in methanol and the TFA salt is dissolved in methanol (possibly with a cosolvent such as dichloromethane) and loaded onto the SCX column. The column is then washed with methanol (possibly with a cosolvent such as dichloromethane) and then the free base is eluted from the column with a 2 N solution of ammonia or triethylamine in methanol (possibly with a cosolvent such as dichloromethane).

        "The binding affinities for human factor Xa are measured as apparent association constants (Kass) derived from protease inhibition kinetics as described previously.a,b,c,d The apparent Kass values are obtained using automated (BioMek-1000) dilutions of inhibitors (Kass determinations are performed in triplicate at each of four-eight inhibitor concentrations) into 96-well plates and chromogenic substrate hydrolysis rates determined at 405 nm using a Thermomax plate reader from Molecular Devices (San Francisco). For factor Xa inhibition, the assay protocol is: 50 \u03bcL buffer (0.06 M tris, 0.3 M NaCl, pH, 7.4); 25 \u03bcL inhibitor test solution (in MeOH); 25 \u03bcL human factor Xa (32 nM in 0.03 M tris, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mg/mL HSA); finally, 150 \u03bcL BzIleGluGlyArgpNA (0.3 mM in water) added within min to start hydrolysis. Final [factor Xa] is 3.2 nM. [Free Xa] and [bound Xa] are determined from linear standard curves on the same plate by use of SoftmaxPro software for each inhibitor concentration and apparent Kass calculated for each inhibitor concentration which produced hydrolysis inhibition between 20% and 80% of the control (3.2 nM factor Xa): apparent Kass=[E:I]/[Ef][If]=[Eb]/[Ef][Io\u2212Ib]. The apparent Kass values so obtained are approximately the inverse of the Ki for the respective inhibitors [1/appKass=app Ki]. The variability of mean apparent Kass values determined at the single substrate concentration is +/\u221215%.
