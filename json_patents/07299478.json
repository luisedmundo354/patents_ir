        "This disclosure in general relates to an integration service and domain object for use in connection with telecommunications operational support.",
        "Changes in the laws relating to the telecommunications industry have required certain telephone companies to provide shared access to common telecommunications resources. Often, a single company manages these common telecommunications resources. As a result, this single company provides access to operational support systems to various competitors, customers, consumers, and vendors. However, the current operational support systems are often single-purpose, inflexible systems that are costly to maintain or enhance. In addition, many companies have multiple telecommunications resources supported by many different single-purpose systems for differing regions. Sharing these resources is complicated by the need to support multiple access protocols and diverse resource support systems. In one example, regional laws require that competitive local exchange carriers (CLEC) be given access to operational support systems managed by incumbent local exchange carriers (ILEC) to provide billing, fulfillment, and assurance support.",
        "Sharing resources is further complicated by mergers and acquisitions of local exchange carriers. With a merger or acquisition, the surviving local exchange carrier faces the problem of supporting multiple diverse legacy systems performing similar functions, or investing considerable capital to replace or standardize the various operational support systems.",
        "As such, many problems exist in providing access to operational support systems. Accordingly, there is a need for improved computer systems for telecommunications operational support.",
        "In a particular embodiment, the disclosure is directed to an integration service. The integration service includes an interface layer, a logic layer, an object layer, and a resource layer. The interface layer includes a plurality of communications adapters. The logic layer includes a first interface and has access to a rules engine. The object layer includes a second interface, a transformation service, and an object. The resource layer includes a plurality of resource interface modules. The resource interface modules have access to a plurality of diverse resource systems. The resource interface modules may acquire a first data from the plurality of diverse resource systems. The transformation service transforms the data into the object. The logic layer accesses the object and provides a second data through one of the plurality of communications adapters.",
        "In another embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a system associated with telecommunication related service. The system includes a business logic layer, and a transformation service module. The business logic layer has access to at least one object. The transformation service module transforms data acquired from the plurality of diverse telecommunication related resource systems into the object.",
        "In a further embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a domain object for use in connection with a telecommunication related integration service. The domain object includes an access interface, and a resource connector interface. The resource connector interface initiates transactions at a plurality of resource connectors associated with remote telecommunication related resource systems.",
        "In an additional embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a method for providing an interface to distributed resource systems. The method includes receiving a first communication from an integration service; instantiating an object; initiating interaction with a resource system; and translating a response from the resource system into the object.",
        "The disclosure is also directed to a method for interacting with distributed resource systems. The method includes requesting a transaction associated with a resource system using an object layer; connecting to a resource system using a resource connection layer to facilitate the transaction; and translating a transaction result into a fielded response using the resource connection layer.",

        "An enterprise integration architecture system is described that enables a diverse set of access systems to communicate with a diverse set of resource systems through a common integrated system architecture. The enterprise integration architecture provides a common framework that can be leveraged when integrating a diverse set of telecommunications technologies and vendor equipment. Efficient and accurate data communications are provided using various exemplary embodiments of enterprise integration architectures, business integration services, adaptors, common integration busses, or common network resources.",
        "FIG. 1 depicts a particular embodiment of an enterprise integration architecture. The architecture includes a business application service 102 in communication with a common integration bus 106 through an adaptor 104. In addition, a business integration service 108, a business integration service shared workspace 114, and a business integration service 122 are connected to the common integration bus 106.",
        "The business application service 102 may take the form of one or more servers and may, for example, include client applications that request services of the business integration services 108 and 122, and the business integration service shared workspace 114. Users may use the business application service 102 to access various data and perform various functions associated with the business integration services tier including the business integration services 108 and 122, and the business integration service shared workspace 114. In turn, the business integration services 108 and 122 may access distributed resources through various applications 112, 126, and 130 and the business integration service shared workspace 114. The resource systems may include diverse and distributed operational support systems for local exchange carriers, vendors, competitors, trading partners, data storage systems, and other systems. In effect, the business integration service systems 108, 114, and 122 function to mediate the disparate data and functions resident in the resource systems by providing a consistent functional interface to client applications. The business integration service systems 108, 114, and 122 may provide additional functional capabilities not supported by the resource systems.",
        "The business integration services 108 and 122 and the business integration services shared workspace 114 represent one or more server systems providing computing functions and data to the business application service 102 through the common integration bus 106 and adaptor 104. The business integration services 108 and 122 access one or more remote resource systems or applications 112, 126 and 130 through various adaptors 110, 124 and 128. The remote resources may include databases, usage systems, PREMIS systems, ASON systems, TIRKS\u00ae systems, Service Order Retrieval Distribution (SORD) systems, and CRIS systems. The business integration services 108 and 122 are organized to access such remote resources to acquire data or perform a requested function and to relay the data or result to the business application service 102. The business integration services 108 and 112 may perform functions such as product management, customer information management, order management, network resource management, service management, location information management, usage management, rating and pricing, bill preparation, and trouble administration.",
        "For example, the business application service 102 may access data or functionality associated with the business integration service 108 through the adaptor 114 and communications integration bus 106. The business integration service 108 accesses a resource or application 112 through an adaptor 110 and provides data or function results to the business application service 102. As illustrated in connection with the business integration service 108, a single application 112 may be accessed through an adaptor 110. Alternately, one or more applications may be accessed by a given business integration service through various adaptors. For example, business integration service 122 may access applications 126 and 130 through adaptors 124 and 128, respectively. In addition, the business application service 102 may access the business integration shared workspace 114. This business integration shared workspace 114 may be coupled with data 116, process states 120 and rules 118. In this manner, data 116, process states 120, and rules 118 may be served or applied from a business integration service tier without accessing a remote resource application.",
        "The business application service 102 may, for example, provide billing, fulfillment, and customer assurance functionality to various access interfaces. These functionalities are achieved by accessing the business integration services 108 and 122 and the business integration shared workspace 114. For example, an integrated billing service may be accomplished through a business application service 102 accessing a business integrated service 122, which acquires usage data from various subscriber systems, such as applications 126 and 130. In another example, address verification may be retrieved by a single business integration service 108 accessing a resource application 112 associated with the requested address. Business application service 102 functionality is achieved through interaction with one or more business integration services and the business integration services shared workspace, each having access to various combinations of applications, data, rules, and process states.",
        "In general, users utilizing a variety of communications, protocols and methods access the business application service 102. The business application service 102 accesses an appropriate business integration service or business integration shared workspace to acquire data or to perform a function. The business integration service or business integration shared workspace accesses data in remote distributed systems to provide the desired functionality. In this manner, a common applications interface may be provided through the business application service 102 while functionality is performed on a variety of remote and diverse resource systems and applications 112, 126 and 130 and through a shared workspace 114.",
        "FIG. 2 depicts a further embodiment of an enterprise integration architecture. In this architecture, a variety of access methods are provided to diverse management and support systems. Access methods, such as desktop applications 250, web browsers 252, IVRs 254, and interconnection services 256 communicate to business application services 232. The business application services 232 access business integration services 210 that in turn access a variety of diverse business management systems 204, operational support systems 206, and external suppliers and providers 208. In this manner, diverse access systems may influence the functionality of diverse resource systems and interfaces.",
        "The business application services 232 may be performed by one or more computational systems or servers. The business application services 232 may include customer care services 234 and provider care services 246. The customer care services 234 may include mass market sales negotiation 236, large business complex ordering 238, problem resolution 240, self-service 242, and a convergent information inquiry 244. The provider care services 246 may include supplier or partner administration services 248. The business application services 232 may function to control workflow processes and manage sessions and states. The business application services 232 may provide such functionality by accessing business integration services 210.",
        "The business integration services 210 may be performed by one or more computational systems or servers. The business integration services 210 may manage and execute tasks and provide stateless business functions. This management and task execution may include providing interfaces, system integration, translation, coordination, scheduling, notification, caching, staging, and metadata repositories. Exemplary embodiments of the business integration services 210 include product management 212, customer information management 214, order/service request management 216, network resource management 218, service management 220, location information management 222, usage management 224, rating and pricing 226, bill preparation 228, and trouble administration 230. These business integration services 210 may function to access diverse resource systems and interfaces through the shared distributed computing infrastructure 260. For example, the business integration services 210 may access business management systems 204. These business management systems 204 may include procurement, human resources, finances, and enterprise data warehouse (EDW) functionality. In some embodiments, the business management systems 204 may take the form of legacy database systems, such as SAP or Oracle, among other similar systems. The business integration services 210 may also access operational support systems 206 through the shared distributed computing infrastructure 260. These operational support systems 206 may include ordering, provisioning, assurance, marketing, billing, work administration, dispatching, and monitoring functions. Further, the business integration services 210 may access external suppliers and providers 208 through the shared distributed computing infrastructure 260. These external suppliers and providers may include long distance companies, network resource suppliers, equipment suppliers, exchanges, and LECs, among others.",
        "The shared distributed computing infrastructure 260 may include shared infrastructure functions such as communications management, directory control, infrastructure management, security, and interconnection services. This infrastructure may be implemented using screen scraping such as SNA LU2, application peer-to-peer communications such as SNA-LU 6.2, IBM MQ Series, TCP/IP socket level programming, and other standard interfaces, such as CORBA, JAVA RMI/IIOP, JMS, JDBC, and message-oriented middleware. The network resources 202 may include network equipment such as switches, routers, connections, and remote terminals.",
        "In one exemplary embodiment, a consumer may access a system through a web browser 252. The web browser may direct communication with the business application services 232 such as the consumer care services 234 (e.g. self service 242). This customer care module 234 may then access a business integration services module, such as the customer information management module 214. The customer information management module 214 may selectively communicate with a business management system 204. Using such a communications path, a consumer may change their associated customer information. In this manner, consumers located in differing geographic regions may access a common website to change information on diverse resource systems.",
        "In another example, a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) may access a business application service 232 through an interconnection service 256. The CLEC may attempt to validate an address or facilitate a channel facility assignment. The business application service 232 may then access a module associated with the business integration service 210, such as the location information management module 222 or the network resource management module 218. The business integration service 210 may then access the business management systems 204 or the operational support systems 206 to facilitate the data transfer or functionality sought by the CLEC. In general, various examples can be envisioned that show a diverse set of access points and protocols accessing a diverse set of resource systems and interfaces to provide a common set of application services.",
        "FIG. 3 depicts a further exemplary embodiment of an enterprise integration architecture. In this exemplary embodiment, various customer channels 302 access a business application framework 304. This business application services framework 304 has infrastructure interfaces 306.

        "The infrastructure system services 308 may provide an application management service 322 such as a software management capability. This capability may permit operation, administration, and maintenance capabilities. The infrastructure system services 308 may also provide a configuration policy rules interface. The process management services 326 may provide a common rules repository for workflow and policy behavior. The security services 316 may apply common security policies across all layers and modules. For example, the permissions of initiators of object invocation may be validated prior to execution. The logging services 312 may log communication between various modules. For example, requests and responses from the business application service and business integration service systems may be logged by logging services 312. Persistence management services 320 may control the caching of objects. Messaging services 318 may utilize messaging standards such as Java Messaging Services (JMS) to provide synchronous, asynchronous, point-to-point, and publish/subscribe messaging. Caching services may be used to improve processing time and data recovery, and to provide temporary persistence containers. Directory services 314 may be used for looking up distributed service registrations and may permit federation of name spaces across numerous software and hardware platforms. The infrastructure system services 308 may also have infrastructure interfaces for providing common access specifications.",
        "The business application services framework 304 and the infrastructure systems services 308 may access a business integration services framework 330 through an infrastructure interface 332. The business integration service framework 330 may include multi-layered logic. This multi-layered logic may include an interface services layer, a business logic layer, a domain object layer, and a resource connector layer. Through these layers, the business integration service framework 330 may connect with and interact with multiple diverse and distributed resource channels 328. With such a system, distributed and diverse customer channels 302 may access a common application services framework 304. This framework 304 may take advantage of reusable infrastructure systems services 308 and the common business integration services framework 330 to facilitate communication with various distributed and diverse resources 328.

        "FIG. 6 depicts an exemplary embodiment of a business integration service application. The business integration services application 604 may reside on one or more servers and acts as an intermediary system between the business application services system 602 and the resource system 606. In this exemplary embodiment, the business integration services application 604 includes a layered architecture integrated through infra system services 608.",
        "The layered structure may include an interface services layer 610, a business logic layer 612, a domain object layer 614, and a resource connector layer 616. Each layer may be instantiated multiple times. The interface services layer 610 may provide interfaces to systems such as business application services system 602.",
        "Communications from the business application services system 602 are received and directed to the business logic layer 612. The business logic layer 612 provides business logic to control the flow and enforcement of enterprise business rules and policies for the business integration services. This business logic may be separated from the knowledge of the resource systems through domain objects. The business logic layer 612 accesses the domain object layer 614 to instantiate domain objects, which in turn may access resource system 606 through the resource connection layer 616. The domain object layer 614 integrates data from various resources into the business logic layer functionality. The domain object layer 614 may access data on resource systems through the resource connector layer 616. In this manner, the domain object layer 614 may integrate and manipulate data without detailed knowledge of the resource interface systems. The resource connector layer 616 connects and interfaces with diverse resource systems using various translators, connectors, and parsers.",
        "FIG. 7 depicts an expanded interface services layer 704. The interface services layer 704 interacts with the business application services system 702 through various adaptors.

The business logic layer 806 may provide various functionality including product management, customer information management, order management, network resource management, service management, location information management, usage management, rating and pricing, bill preparation, and trouble administration. The business logic layer 806 may use a common identity or access key provided by the business application service.",
        "FIG. 9 depicts an illustrative domain object layer 906. The domain object layer 906 provides instances of domain objects to the business logic layer 902 and interacts with the business logic layer 902 through an interface 904. The domain object layer 906 also interacts with the resource connector layer 910. The domain object layer 906 may include a transformation service 908 that transforms the information that is stored in various resource systems into data object instances. A resource connection layer may access and translate data via resource connectors. This data may be provided to the domain object layer 906 for transformation into domain objects. In addition, the domain object layer 906 may interact with workflow process logic 912, rules engine 914 and domain object cache 916. For example, the process logic 912, rules associated with the rules engine 914, and management of domain object cache 916 may be influenced by the instances of the domain objects. The workflow process logic 912 and rules engine 914 may, in turn, influence the actions of the business logic layer 902.",
        "To create a domain object, the domain object layer 906 determines the resource system transactions that may be used to create a requested domain object. In part, the domain object layer 906 may be directed by drivers or controllers in the business logic layer 902. Then, the domain object layer 906 requests the resource connection layer 910 to perform the resource system transactions. The domain object layer 906 translates the results of the resource system transactions into domain objects. The domain object layer 910 may use the common identity or access key provided by the business application service when communicating with the resource connector layer 910.",
        "Persistence of domain objects may be utilized through the domain object cache 916. Domain objects may be cached as requested or pre-fetched according to rules and policies. These rules and policies may also be tuned at runtime to enhance performance.",
        "FIG. 10 depicts an illustrative method for creating and using a domain object. A first communication is received, at step 1002. This first communication may, for example, be a request for an address validation, a channel facility assignment request, a telephone number inquiry, a telephone number cancellation, a telephone number reservation, an information request, or a transaction request. A domain object is instantiated, at step 1004. Then, interaction is initiated with a resource system, at step 1006. The resource systems may, for example, be a PREMIS, ASON, or TIRKS\u00ae system. In the event that a response is provided by the resource system, the response is transformed into the domain object, at step 1008. The system, then, provides a second communication, at step 1010. This second communication may be sent to a business application service and provided to a requestor.",
        "FIG. 11 depicts an expanded resource connector layer 1106. The resource connector layer 1106 communicates with the domain object layer 1102 through a Java resource message object 1109.

Through the resource connector layer 1106, the domain object layer 1102 may communicate with the diverse resource systems 1130.",
        "For example, the resource connector layer 1106 may receive a request from the domain object layer 1102. The resource connector layer 1106 may, then, connect to resource systems to facilitate a transaction. The results of the transaction are then translated into a fielded response. The transaction results are then provided to the domain object layer 1102.",
        "To integrate a resource system into the architecture, an adaptor or connector may be coupled to or given access to the resource system. The adaptor or connector may also be coupled to a resource channel of the distributed computing system or business integration service. In this manner, legacy systems, diverse operational support systems, diverse billing support systems, and diverse facility systems may be integrated into the enterprise infrastructure. Such integration may be useful when merging or acquiring telecommunication related companies serving diverse regions or offering diverse services.",
        "FIG. 12 depicts an exemplary method for use by the resource layer. A domain object may request data or a transaction. In response to a request, the resource layer may request a transaction, at step 1202. The transaction may be a database query, facility assignment, or resource allocation, among others. The resource layer connects to the resource system, at step 1204. A response or result from the resource system or transaction may be translated, at a step 1206. For example, the response may be translated into fielded data. The translated response may then be provided to the domain object or other layers of the business integration service, at a step 1208.",

The product management module 1310 integrates product information into the enterprise. The service request management module 1312 integrates service request information into the enterprise. The location information management module 1314 integrates location information into the enterprise. The billing information management module 1316 integrates billing information into the enterprise. The network resource management module 1318 integrates network resource information into the enterprise. This network resource management module 1318 may have similar functions to the network address management module 1326 and resource management module 1328. The service management module 1320 integrates service information into the enterprise. The availability management module 1322 integrates product feature and service availability information into the enterprise. The customer information management module 1324 integrates customer information into the enterprise. The network address management 1326 integrates network address information into the enterprise. The resource management module 1328 integrates network resource information into the enterprise. The trouble management module 1330 integrates trouble report information into the enterprise. These modules function along with the business logic layer 1302 to determine what data to gather or action to facilitate in response to communication from a business application service. The business logic layer 1302 and its modules instantiate objects associated with the domain object layer 1304. The domain object layer 1304 then accesses resource connections to acquire the requested data or facilitate the desired action. Information or results may then be transferred back through the domain object layer 1304 to the business logic layer 1302 and out to the requesting business application service system.",
        "FIG. 14 represents operation of an exemplary business integration services system in action in response to various business application services events. The business integration services system provides business logic and resource interaction. Events such as BAS 1 1402, BAS 2 1404, and BAS 3 1406 are communicated through the communication services 1410 to various business logic modules such as product management 1412, service request management 1414, location information management 1414, billing information management 1418, network resource management 1420 and service management 1422. These business logic modules determine what information or action is needed in response to the business application services event. These modules then communicate through a communications service 1430 to a business integration services workspace 1470. This business integration services workspace 1470 may be organized into various factory elements. For example, factory elements 1432, 1434, and 1436 are connected to domain object models 1440, business process management 1450 and policy management 1460, respectively. The business logic modules may, using a domain object, access product data, subscription data, accounting, and inventory data, among others. In addition, the systems may access business process management 1450 or policy management 1460. In this manner, any one business logic module may access one or more of the logical factories 1432, 1434, and 1436 to perform the desired action or to acquire the requested data.",
