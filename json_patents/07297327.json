        "The present invention relates to a dentifrice composition useful for reducing oral malodor. In particular, the present invention includes dentifrices incorporating a malodor agent containing thymol, anise, fennel, basil, and juniperberry essential oils.",
        "Many individuals desire a \u201cbright\u201d smile, healthy teeth, and a pleasant personal presence in social interactions. Unfortunately, some foods, while enjoyable when consumed, deposit and/or transfer chemical compounds into the oral cavity or into the blood stream that linger to afflict the social presence of a person with malodor during exhalation accompanying conversation and/or respiration. This malodor generally detracts from the desired pleasant social presence. Garlic and onion containing foods are especially of concern in this regard and have frustrated long term efficacy in malodor remedies.",

In somewhat greater detail, the invention is for an oral odor control agent composition, comprising:\n\n    \n    \n        (a) from about 10 weight percent to about 30 weight percent thymol essential oil;\n        (b) from about 10 weight percent to about 30 weight percent anise essential oil;\n        (c) from about 10 weight percent to about 30 weight percent fennel essential oil;\n        (d) from about 10 weight percent to about 30 weight percent basil essential oil; and\n        (e) a remainder of juniperberry essential oil wherein said juniperberry essential oil is from about 10 weight percent to about 30 weight percent of said oral admixture composition.",
        "In one aspect, the oral control agent is provided in from about 0.3 weight percent to about 2 weight percent of an oral care vehicle in a product such as mouthwash, dental cream, or toothpaste. In another aspect, the oral control agent is provided in a lozenge or other portable form such as a mint, bead, wafer, liquid formulated for oral application from a small portable nebulizer (spray bottle), liquid formulated for oral application from a small portable drop-generating bottle, or a soft pliable tablet (\u201cchewie\u201d).",

        "In this regard, a surprising result (see the Examples) shows that this particular mixture of thymol, anise, fennel, basil, and juniperberry essential oils provides especial efficacy in reducing garlic odor in human testing. This surprising find surmounts the traditional challenge of controlling complex and systemically sustained garlic odor and onion odor. Actives such as copper chlorophyllin and parsley seed oil have traditionally been used to control garlic malodor. However, a mixture embodiment of thymol, anise, fennel, basil, and juniperberry essential oils in equivalent parts shows a surprisingly dramatic reduction of nearly 80 percent in garlic malodor.",

        "The best-performing odor control actives of Example 1 are tested in combination to explore synergistic effects using the technique of Example 1. A control of a traditional garlic odor oral care active blend is also tested according to the same technique. The five actives of thymol, anise, fennel, basil, and juniperberry essential oils, when combined at a ratio of 1:1:1:1:1 (20 weight percent each respective to the odor control active test formulation) indicate the most effective additive and/or synergistic effect of all combinations. Quantitative garlic odor efficacy for the thymol, anise, fennel, basil, and juniperberry essential oils blend in ratio of 1:1:1:1:1 indicates a 78 percent reduction in garlic odor components in the test headspace. Quantitative garlic odor efficacy for the control (the traditional garlic odor oral care active blend) indicates a 53 percent reduction in garlic odor components in the test headspace. The results indicate a surprising efficacy for the thymol, anise, fennel, basil, and juniperberry essential oils blend in 1:1:1:1:1 blending.",
