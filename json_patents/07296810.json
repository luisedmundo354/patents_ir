        "This Patent Application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/558,458, filed Apr. 1, 2004.",
        "This invention relates generally to apparatus and a method for installing a sensor, and more particularly, to apparatus and a method for installing a sensor in adjustable connection with relatively movable members, particularly a steerable wheel of a vehicle and related structure, for accurately sensing relative position thereof, without requiring adjusting the sensor during or after the installation.",
        "Commonly, a sensor for sensing relative position of members require some adjustment of the sensor during installation. For instance, a sensor for sensing a rotational position or steering angle of a wheel and/or wheel hub assembly of a vehicle about a steering axis typically must be installed such that correct electrical outputs are produced when the wheel and/or hub assembly is in a center or straight ahead position and in a range of rotated or turned positions. Achieving this commonly entails a trial and error process wherein the sensor is mounted or installed, and then is adjusted, such as by applying a voltage input to the sensor and rotating it while in its mounted position and measuring voltage outputs, until an orientation is found wherein desired output or outputs are obtained. The sensor is then fixed in that orientation. Disadvantages of this process include the time and equipment required for the trial and error steps, and inconvenience due to the location of the sensor in connection with a steering system which is typically in a difficult to access location such as beneath the vehicle or in a steering assembly. If exposes, and adjustably mounted, the sensor can be jarred out of adjustment, and fasteners holding the sensor in an adjusted position can become loosened. Additionally, an extension such as a shaft or other member is commonly required to connect the sensor input to the relatively movable member to which it is to be connected, which can add another variable to the adjustment process. Reference in this regard, Lukac U.S. Pat. No. 6,494,471B1 issued Dec. 17, 2002 to New Holland North America, Inc., and Chino et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,261,182B1 issued Jul. 17, 2001 to Kabushiki Kaisha Toyoda Jidoshokki Seisakusho of Japan.",
        "In a similar manner, when a linear sensor actuated by a lever must be installed such that a correct electrical output is produced when the lever is in a particular position, such as a center position, a trial and error adjustment process is typically also required.",
        "Thus, what is sought is apparatus and a method for installing a sensor in connection with relatively movable members such as an axle assembly and a steerable wheel, which overcomes one or more of the disadvantages set forth above.",
        "According to the invention, apparatus and a method for installing a sensor in connection with relatively movable members for sensing relative position thereof, without requiring adjustment of the sensor, which overcomes many of the disadvantages set forth above, is disclosed. According to a preferred apparatus and method of the invention, the sensor includes a body or portion mountable in a predetermined position on a first of the members and an input or portion movable relative to the body or other portion, the sensor being operable for providing a signal representative of a position of the input relative to the body, including a predetermined signal representative of a predetermined position of the input. The invention utilizes a coupler adjustably connectable to a second of the members and connectable in predetermined relation to the input of the sensor for coupling the input to the second member. The coupler can be adjustably connected to the second member in a predetermined relation to the first member such that when the input of the sensor is connected to the coupler and the body is mounted in the predetermined position on the first member, the input and the body will be relatively positioned such that the sensor will provide the predetermined signal when the first and second members are in the predetermined relative position. The input of the sensor is connected in the predetermined relation to the coupler and the body is mounted in the predetermined position on the first member, such that when one or both of the first and second members are moved so as to be in different relative positions, the sensor will provide signals representative of the different relative positions, respectively, including the predetermined signal when the members are in the predetermined relative position.",
        "As a result of using the installation method according to the invention, when the sensor is installed, it is in proper position and orientation relative to the second member for providing or outputting a signal representative of the predetermined relative position, which can represent a straight ahead orientation in the instance of a steering assembly, as well as predetermined signals representative of a range of relatively rotated positions of the members, which can, for instance, represent rotational positions of elements of the steering assembly, such as of a wheel and hub assembly relative to another structure such as an axle housing, supporting kingpin, or other related structure.",
        "The sensor input is preferably connected to the second relatively rotatable member via a pin or shaft, to allow the sensor to be positioned a desired distance away. The coupler can thus be placed on the pin or shaft and rotated thereabout to achieve a required rotational orientation to provide the required signals. Once oriented, the coupler can then be secured to the pin or shaft in any suitable manner to prevent relative rotation thereof, including using a common fastener such as a screw threadedly receivable in a threaded hole in an end of the shaft opposite the second member, a press fit, or the like. The coupler and the sensor input can include matingly engageable elements, such as, but not limited to, a hexagonal or other multifaceted male element receivable in a correspondingly faceted female receptacle for joint rotation. The sensor can be provided with the input positioned in a predetermined rotational orientation or position relative to the body, such that when the input is matingly engaged with the coupler and the body portion is mounted, all elements of the sensor will be properly positioned or oriented corresponding to the position or rotational orientation of the second member such that no positioning or other adjustment of the sensor is required.",

        "FIG. 5 is a high level flow diagram showing steps of a method of the invention.",
        "Referring now to the drawings, in FIGS. 1, 2, 3 and 4, apparatus 10 of the invention for installing a sensor for sensing angular position of a wheel hub assembly 12 of the vehicle 14 about a generally vertical steering axis 16 extending through wheel hub assembly 12, is shown. Wheel hub assembly 12 is a conventionally constructed and operable wheel hub assembly including a housing 18 to which is mountable a conventional wheel and tire assembly 20 (FIG. 1) on a mounting flange 22 using an array of lugs 24. Housing 18 and wheel and tire assembly 20 are rotatable about a generally horizontal drive axis 26 extending therethrough and through wheel hub assembly 12 in the well known manner. Wheel and tire assembly 20 and housing 18 are additionally rotatable with wheel hub assembly 12 about steering axis 16, also in the well known manner. Vehicle 14 shown is a conventionally constructed and operable tractor which is representative of a wide variety of other agricultural work machines, construction machines, mining machines, forestry machines, and the like, for which the present apparatus has utility. Here, it should be appreciated that although apparatus 10 and the method of installation according to the invention have utility for use with a wide variety of steerable wheel arrangements, including non-driven or powered wheels, apparatus 10 and the method of the invention are particularly advantageous for use with wheels of relatively heavy work machines and vehicles like vehicle 14, due to the ability to install a rotational position sensor without adjustment, so as to be capable of providing accurate, reliable sensing of angular position of the wheel hub and thus the wheel mounted thereto relative to a desired or selected reference. Apparatus and the installation method of the invention also facilitate and allow removal and disassembly of apparatus 10 and also the components of wheel hub assembly 12, and reinstallation and assembly, without requiring adjustment of the sensor. Apparatus 10 and the method of the invention also have utility for installation of sensors for a wide variety of other applications involving relatively movable members and thus are not to be considered to be limited to the embodiment set forth herein.",
        "Wheel hub assembly 12 includes a C shape support frame 28 which supports housing 18 for rotation about drive axis 26. Support frame 28 includes an upper arm 32 projecting in cantilever relation from the top of a central portion and a lower arm (not shown) projecting in cantilever relation from the bottom of central portion , thereby defining a space 36 therebetween in which is located an axle housing end 34. Upper arm 32 has a passage 38 therethrough coaxial with steering axis 16, in which an upper kingpin 40 is fixedly mounted. The lower arm includes a similar passage therethrough which receives a lower kingpin (also not shown). Upper kingpin 40 and the lower kingpin connect wheel hub assembly 12 to axle housing end 34 for relative rotation or steering movement about steering axis 16. The steering movements of wheel hub assembly 12 and the wheel and tire assembly 20 mounted thereto about steering axis 16 are effected by longitudinal movements of a tire rod 42, connected at one end to wheel hub assembly 12 and at an opposite end to a conventional steering input device (not shown) on vehicle 14, which input device can be manually controlled, typically by a steering wheel, and/or automatically controlled by an automatic guidance system connected to apparatus 10 for receiving steering angle information therefrom.",
        "As best shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, upper kingpin 40 includes an axial passage 44 therethrough extending between a lower axial opening 46 on a bottom axial end portion 48 of kingpin 40, and an upper opening 50 on a top surface 52 thereof. By the usage of the term \u201caxial\u201d in connection with passage 44 herein, it is meant that steering axis 16 extends through passage 44, but not necessarily that passage 44 has a central axis coincident with steering axis 16.",
        "Bottom axial end portion 48 of upper kingpin 40 is received in a bearing assembly 54 including an inner bearing ring 56 which mounts to bottom axial end portion 48 for rotation therewith relative to an outer bearing ring 58. As shown in FIG. 3, outer bearing ring 58 is receivable in an axial counter bore 60 forming a bearing seat in axle housing end 34. Beneath counter bore 60 is an open space 62 within axle housing end 34. An annular grease seal 64 is receivable in counter bore 60 to form a sealed condition around kingpin 40 above bearing assembly 54, for preventing or limiting passage of grease upwardly around the kingpin as desired.",
        "A grease retainer 66 or 66A (FIG. 4) is positionable on and fixedly mounted to a lower shoulder 68 of axle housing end 34 around counter bore 60 beneath outer bearing ring 58, for preventing passage of grease therebelow into space 62. Retainer 66 or 66A is preferably fixedly mounted to shoulder 68 using an adhesive sealant such as commonly available under the Loctite tradename. Retainer 66 or 66A thus defines a lower periphery of a lubricant cavity 70 which has an upper periphery enclosed by seal 64 around kingpin 40. Thus, it is evident that axial passage 44 through kingpin 40 extends between top surface 52 of kingpin 40 and lubricant cavity 70.",
        "Kingpin 40 is mounted in passage 38 of wheel hub assembly 12 in a predetermined orientation about steering axis 16 and in predetermined relation to a first reference associated with wheel hub assembly 12, such as drive axis 26 or an associated element such as a surface of flange 22 of wheel hub assembly 12 against which wheel and tire assembly 20 is or will be mounted and which establishes the direction of rotation of wheel and tire assembly 20, using a plurality of bolts 72 threadedly received in threaded holes 74 in upper arm 32 at predetermined spaced angular locations around passage 38 and steering axis 16. One or more shims 73 can be disposed between kingpin 40 and the surface of arm 32 as required for height adjustment. With bottom axial end portion 48 of kingpin 40 received in inner bearing ring 56, and inner bearing ring 56 received in outer bearing ring 58 mounted in counter bore 60 of axle housing end 34, and with a similar lower kingpin arrangement on the bottom, wheel hub assembly 12 is connected to and can support axle housing end 34, and is rotatable about steering axis 16 relative thereto in the well known manner.",
        "A sensor 76 is provided for determining or sensing the rotational or steering position of wheel hub assembly 12 about axis 16 relative to a second reference, which is associated with vehicle 14. Sensor 76 can be, for instance, but is not limited to, a well known, commercially available Hall effect type sensor or a potentiometer, including circuitry which when powered is operable for sensing or detecting a rotational position or orientation of an input element 78 which is preferably supported for rotation in or extends into or through a body portion 80 of sensor 76. According to the invention, body portion 80 is fixedly mountable in a predetermined position on top surface 52 of kingpin 40 in a predetermined angular orientation about steering axis 16 relative to the first reference associated the wheel such as drive axis 26 or the associated element such as the outer surface of flange 22 of wheel hub assembly 12 against which wheel and tire assembly 20 is mounted. This can be accomplished in a suitable manner, such as using screws 82 threadedly receivable in threaded holes 84 located at predetermined locations in top surface 52 relative to the first reference.",
        "Because the positions of threaded holes 74 in upper arm 32 of wheel hub assembly 12 relative to the first reference such as drive axis 26 are known, and the positions of threaded holes 84 in kingpin 40 to the first reference are known, when kingpin 40 is installed in the predetermined orientation on upper arm 32, and body portion 80 of sensor 74 is installed on kingpin 40, body portion 80 will be in a known relation to the first reference, and, when the first reference is in a particular position, for instance, a straight ahead position, body portion 80 will be in known relation to that position. As a result, when hub assembly 12 and kingpin 40 are rotated about steering axis 16 relative to axle housing end 34 from the known rotational position, body portion 80 of sensor 76 and drive axis 26 are correspondingly rotated relative thereto, and, by holding or fixing input element 78 of sensor 76 to axle housing end 34, sensor 76 would be caused to change state corresponding to the relative rotation.",
        "Referring more particularly to FIGS. 3 and 4, apparatus 10 includes a pin 86 for connecting axle housing end 34 to input element 78 of sensor 76 through axial passage 44 of kingpin 40. Pin 86 has an upper end 88 and an opposite lower end 90. Discussing lower end 90 first, that end is fixedly mountable or connected in a suitable manner to grease retainer 66 or 66A, which is modified for that purpose, and, in turn, is fixed to lower shoulder 68 in counter bore 60 of axle housing end 34 as explained above. As a result, when wheel hub 12 is rotated about steering axis 16 relative to axle housing end 34, kingpin 40 and sensor body 80 will correspondingly rotate about pin 86. Pin 86 can be fixedly mounted or connected to retainer 66 or 66A in any suitable manner. For instance, here, retainer 66 or 66A is modified to include an axial hole 94 therethrough adapted for receiving lower end 90 of pin 86, which is threaded for threadedly receiving a nut 92. A flanged sleeve 96 is insertable from above into an axial hole in retainer 66 or 66A and includes hole 94 therethrough for receiving end 90 of pin 86. Pin 86 is thus securable to retainer 66 or 66A by threaded engagement with nut 92. An advantage of this construction is that it allows pin 86 to be installed after kingpin 40 and retainer 66 or 66A are installed, and without positioning or aligning of either retainer 66 or 66A and/or pin 86 about steering axis 16 to a reference such as drive axis 26.",
        "Kingpin 40 additionally preferably includes a lateral passage 98 therethrough extending between an external opening 100 and axial passage 44. A cap or grease fitting 102 can be threadedly or otherwise disposed in external opening 100. This provides a path for introduction of lubricant, such as grease, into axial passage 44, through which the lubricant can flow into lubricant cavity 70, for lubricating bearing assembly 54. To contain and prevent passage of lubricant upwardly through passage 44 around pin 86, pin 86 of the invention preferably includes an O-ring groove 104 therearound, for receiving an O-ring 106 (FIG. 3), for forming a sealed condition with the inner surface of passage 44 around pin 86 when installed therein. Other means, such as a grease seal, could also be provided between pin 86 and kingpin 40 at a location above lateral passage 98, as required or desired.",
        "Sensor 76 is operable for outputting a signal representative of a state thereof, such as, but not limited to, a relative rotational position of input element 78 and body portion 80, over a suitable conductive path, such as a wire of a wiring harness 108 (FIGS. 2 and 3). Referring more particularly to FIG. 1, for the purposes of the present application, it is desired that this signal be representative of a rotational or steering position of wheel hub assembly 12 and wheel and tire assembly 20, represented by drive axis 26, relative to a selected second reference such as, but not limited to, a centerline of axle housing end 34, denoted by line A; a centerline of vehicle 14, denoted by line B, and/or another reference such as a centerline of rear axle of vehicle 14, denoted by line C. It is also desired that sensor 76 be installable so as to accurately output this information without requiring adjustment or repositioning.",
        "Apparatus 10 of the invention achieves this capability by providing a coupler 110 which is mountable on upper end 88 of pin 86 in a required rotational position about axis 16 relative to the first reference associated with wheel hub assembly 12, such as drive axis 26 or the mounting surface of mounting flange 22. Coupler 110 is cooperatively engageable in a predetermined, non-relatively rotatable manner, with input element 78 of sensor 76, for connecting element 78 to axle housing end 34. Thus, with coupler 110 mounted on upper end 88 of pin 86 in predetermined relation to the first reference, element 78 in a predetermined rotational position relative to body portion 80, and body portion 80 in predetermined relation to the first reference, when powered, sensor 76 will output a signal accurately representative of the rotational or steering position of wheel hub assembly 12 relative to vehicle 14. For instance, if wheel hub assembly 12 is in a predetermined steering position, such as the straight ahead position, sensor 76 when powered will output a predetermined signal representative of that position, and different predetermined signals when wheel hub assembly 12 is rotated relative to axle housing end 34 to different steering positions.",
        "Coupler 110 preferably has an outer surface having a predetermined shape which is cooperatively receivable in a correspondingly shape receptacle 112 of element 78 of sensor 76, for locking coupler 110 and element 78 together when the sensor is installed. Coupler 110 is preferably of tubular construction or includes an axial hole 114 therethrough (FIG. 4) for cooperatively receiving upper end 88 of pin 86. This allows coupler 110 to be placed on upper end 88 in a predetermined orientation or relationship to a selected reference, which can be, for instance, the first reference discussed above associated with wheel hub assembly 12. This can be done in any suitable convenient manner such as using a jig or tool, and/or a laser alignment device, and/or one or more lines, surfaces or marks on the components, if any. When coupler 110 is in the required position, it can be secured in place by a screw 116 insertable through hole 114 and threadedly receivable in a threaded hole 118 in upper end 88, such that coupler 110 and pin 86 will be locked together. In this regard, upper end 88 and hole 114 in coupler 110 can have outer and inner surfaces, respectively, which are optionally tapered and relatively sized such that coupler 110 will be press fit on upper end 88 as screw 116 is threaded therein and/or as body portion 80 is screwed onto surface 52 of the kingpin. Coupler 110 shown includes a hexagonal outer surface 120 which matingly engages a corresponding hexagonal inner surface 122 in receptacle 112 of element 78 of sensor 76 (FIG. 1) when received therein, for locking pin 86, coupler 110 and element 78 together when sensor 76 is installed on kingpin 40. Thus, one or more of the flat surfaces of outer surface 120 could be used for the alignment. Alternatively, coupler 110 and receptacle 112 can have other mating shapes, such as, but not limited to, shapes having one or more flat sides such as a D shape (illustrated by alternative coupler 110A in FIG. 4). As a general rule, for more precision in the alignment, coupler 110 would have a greater number of flat sides. As another alternative, it is contemplated that a receptacle 112 could be provided on coupler 110 and element 78 could include a projection receivable in receptacle 112 on coupler 110, if desired. Before or when sensor 76 is installed, element 78 will be oriented in a predetermined position in body 80 so as to be operable for outputting a signal having a predetermined value for the position corresponding to the aligning marks on element 78 and body 80, such that element 78 and body 80, and thus hub assembly 12, will be in known relation to the selected reference.",
        "Thus, wheel hub assembly 12 can be installed in a normal manner on axle housing end 34, and sensor 76 can be simply installed without adjustment by inserting pin 86 into axial passage 44 and connecting it to retainer 66 or 66A, mounting coupler 110 in the required orientation on upper end 88 of pin 86, and then mounting body 80 of the coupler on kingpin 40 with element 78 in a predetermined position in body 80 and matingly connected to coupler 110. As an example, referring again to FIG. 1, wheel hub assembly 12 can be positioned such that drive axis 26 is aligned or parallel with the centerline A of axle housing end 34, or in some other known relation thereto. Coupler 110 can be positioned such that a flat side of hexagonal outer surface 120 is in predetermined relation to axis 26, such as perpendicular thereto, as shown. Screw 116 (FIGS. 3 and 4) can then be inserted in and threadedly engaged with threaded hole 114 in upper end 88 of pin 86, for holding coupler 110 in position. Sensor 76, with input element 78 oriented in predetermined relation to body 80 as shown, can then be installed on top surface 52 of kingpin 40 using screws 82 threadedly engageable in holes 84, such that coupler 110 is matingly received in receptacle 112 of element 78 to lock element 78, coupler 110 and pin 86 together with retainer 66 or 66A (FIG. 3). As a result, rotation of kingpin 40 with wheel hub assembly 12 will correspondingly rotate body 80 of sensor 76 relative to element 78, such that sensor 76 will output a signal representative of the rotation. Subsequently, if removal of sensor 76 and/or wheel hub assembly 12 from axle housing end 34 is required, reinstallation or replacement of sensor 76 is accomplished in the same manner.",
        "Referring also to FIG. 5, a flow diagram 124 showing steps of installing a sensor such as, but not limited to, sensor 76, without adjustment according to the present invention, is shown. Prior to the installation, wheel hub assembly 12 is installed on axle housing end 34 in the normal manner, such that retainer 66 or 66A is in position on shoulder 68 and kingpin 40 is mounted on wheel hub assembly 12, all as explained above. As a first step, as denoted by block 126, pin 86 is installed on retainer 66 or 66A, in connection with axle housing end 34, by insertion into and through passage 44 of kingpin 40, through hole 94 of retainer 66 or 66A, and threaded engagement with nut 92. As denoted at block 128, coupler 110 is placed on upper end 88 of pin 86 and aligned with a reference, such as, but not limited to, mounting flange 22 of hub assembly 12, by aligning a flat surface portion of outer surface 120 with flange 22. Coupler 110 is then secured in the aligned position on end 88 with screw 116, as denoted by block 1. Sensor 76, with element 78 in predetermined position in body 80, can then be installed on surface 52 of kingpin 40 with screws 82, as denoted by block 132.",
        "Here, it should be noted that the apparatus and method of the invention are adapted for use in a wide variety of other applications in addition to that set forth above. For instance, the apparatus and method of the invention are adapted for use in installing a sensor such as sensor 76 on a lower kingpin of the construction set forth herein in the same manner as set forth above. The apparatus and method of the invention are also adapted for constructions wherein the kingpin is fixedly mountable on the axle end and the wheel hub is rotatable relative thereto, such that pin 86, coupler 110 and element 78 will rotate relative to body 80 of the sensor.",
