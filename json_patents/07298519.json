        "1 Introduction",
        "The invention will be described with reference to a high-performance color printer which combines photographic-quality image reproduction with magazine-quality text reproduction. The printer utilizes an 8\u2033 page-width drop-on-demand microelectromechanical inkjet (\u201cMEMJET\u201d) printhead which produces 1600 dots per inch (dpi) bi-level CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, blacK). It prints 30 full-color A4 or Letter pages per minute, and is intended as an entry-level desktop printer. The printer has been designated as iprint and will be referred to by that name in the following description.",
        "1.1 Operational Overview",
        "iPrint reproduces black text and graphics directly using bi-level black, and continuous-tone (contone) images and graphics using dithered bi-level CMYK. For practical purposes, iprint supports a black resolution of 800 dpi, and a contone resolution of 267 pixels per inch (ppi).",
        "iPrint is, in use, attached to a workstation or personal computer (PC) via a relatively low-speed (1.5 MBytes/s) universal serial bus (USB) connection [15]. iPrint relies on the PC to render each page to the level of contone pixels and black dots. The PC compresses each rendered page to less than 3 MB for sub-two-second delivery to the printer. iPrint decompresses and prints the page line by line at the speed of the MEMJET printhead. iPrint contains sufficient buffer memory for two compressed pages (6 MB), allowing it to print one page while receiving the next, but does not contain sufficient buffer memory for even a single uncompressed page (119 MB).",
        "1.2 Page Width",
        "The standard MEMJET nozzle layout has a half-inch unit cell, and so can be trivially adapted to page widths which are multiples of half an inch. Arbitrary page widths can be achieved with custom nozzle layouts, in markets which justify such specialisation. The initial MEMJET building block is a widely useful four-inch printhead which makes efficient use of a six-inch silicon wafer. The iPrint design therefore assumes an eight-inch MEMJET printhead, made up of two four-inch printheads joined together. The use of a wider printhead to achieve full bleed on A4/Letter pages only affects a few aspects of the iPrint design\u2014specifically the exact mechanical design, and the logic of the printhead interface.",
        "2 MEMJET-Based Printing",
        "A MEMJET printhead produces 1600 dpi bi-level CMYK. On low-diffusion paper, each ejected drop forms an almost perfectly circular 22.5 micron diameter dot. Dots are easily produced in isolation, allowing dispersed-dot dithering to be exploited to its fullest. Since the MEMJET printhead is page-width and operates with a constant paper velocity, the four color planes are printed in perfect registration, allowing ideal dot-on-dot printing. Since there is consequently no spatial interaction between color planes, the same dither matrix is used for each color plane.",
        "A page layout may contain a mixture of images, graphics and text. Continuous-tone (contone) images and graphics are reproduced using a stochastic dispersed-dot dither. Unlike a clustered-dot (or amplitude-modulated) dither, a dispersed-dot (or frequency-modulated) dither reproduces high spatial frequencies (i.e. image detail) almost to the limits of the dot resolution, while simultaneously reproducing lower spatial frequencies to their full color depth. A stochastic dither matrix is carefully designed to be free of objectionable low-frequency patterns when tiled across the image. As such its size typically exceeds the minimum size required to support a number of intensity levels (i.e. 16\u00d716\u00d78 bits for 257 intensity levels). iPrint uses a dither volume of size 64\u00d764\u00d73\u00d78 bits. The dither volume provides an extra degree of freedom during the design of the dither by allowing a dot to change states multiple times through the intensity range [12], rather than just once as in a conventional dither matrix.",
        "Human contrast sensitivity peaks at a spatial frequency of about 3 cycles per degree of visual field and then falls off logarithmically, decreasing by a factor of 100 and becoming difficult to measure beyond about 40 cycles per degree [2]. At a normal viewing distance of between 400 mm and 250 mm, this translates roughly to 150-250 cycles per inch (cpi) on the printed page, or 300-500 samples per inch according to Nyquist's theorem. Taking into account the fact that color sensitivity is less acute than grayscale sensitivity, contone resolution beyond about 400 pixels per inch (ppi) is therefore of limited utility, and in fact contributes slightly to color error through the dither.",
        "Black text and graphics are reproduced directly using bi-level black dots, and are therefore not antialiased (i.e. low-pass filtered) before being printed. Text is therefore supersampled beyond the perceptual limits discussed above, to produce smooth edges when spatially integrated. Text resolution up to about 1200 dpi continues to contribute to perceived text sharpness (assuming low-diffusion paper, of course).",
        "3.1 Constraints",
        "USB (Universal Serial Bus) is the standard low-speed peripheral connection on new PCs [4]. The standard high-speed peripheral connection, IEEE 1394, is recommended but unfortunately still optional in the PC 99 specification [5], and so may not be in widespread use when iPrint is first launched. iPrint therefore connects to a personal computer (PC) or workstation via USB, and the speed of the USB connection therefore imposes the most significant constraint on the architecture of the iPrint system. At a sustained printing rate of 30 pages/minute, USB at 1.5 MByte/s imposes an average limit of 3 MB/page. Since the act of interrupting a MEMJET-based printer during the printing of a page produces a visible discontinuity, it is advantageous for the printer to receive the entire page before commencing printing, to eliminate the possibility of buffer underrun. Since the printer can contain only limited buffer memory, i.e. two pages' worth or 6 MB, then the 3 MB/page limit must be considered absolute.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates the sustained printing rate achievable with double-buffering in the printer. The first stage 1 requires the first page to be rendered in the PC, and this takes up to two seconds. During the second stage 2 the next page is rendered and the first page is transferred to the printer, again this takes up to two seconds. In the third stage 3 the first page is printed, the second page is transferred and a third page is rendered, this takes two seconds. As a result it takes up to six seconds for the first page to be printed and thereafter a page can be printed every two seconds.",
        "Other desktop connection options provide similar bandwidth to USB, and so impose similar constraints on the architecture. These include the parallel port at 2 MB/s, and 10Base-T Ethernet at around 1 MB/s",
        "3.2 Page Rendering and Compression",
        "Page rendering (or rasterization) can be split between the PC and printer in various ways. Some printers support a full page description language (PDL) such as Postscript, and contain correspondingly sophisticated renderers. Other printers provide special support only for rendering text, to achieve high text resolution. This usually includes support for built-in or downloadable fonts. In each case the use of an embedded renderer reduces the rendering burden on the PC and reduces the amount of data transmitted from the PC to the printer. However, this comes at a price. These printers are more complex than they might be, and are often unable to provide full support for the graphics system of the PC, through which application programs construct, render and print pages. They often fail to exploit the high performance of current PCs, and are unable to leverage projected exponential growth in PC performance.",
        "iPrint relies on the PC 4 to render pages, i.e. contone images and graphics to the pixel level, and black text and graphics to the dot level. iPrint 5 contains only a simple rendering engine which dithers the contone data and combines the results with any foreground bi-level black text and graphics. This strategy keeps the printer simple, and independent of any page description language or graphics system. It fully exploits the high performance of current PCs. The downside of this strategy is the potentially large amount of data which must be transmitted from the PC to the printer. We consequently use compression to reduce this data to the 3 MB/page required to allow a sustained printing rate of 30 pages/minute.",
        "FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating the conceptual data flow from an application 6 to a printed page 7.",
        "An 8\u2033 by 11.7\u2033 A4 page has a bi-level CMYK pagesize of 114.3 MBytes at 1600 dpi, and a contone CMYK pagesize of 32.1 MB at 300 ppi.",
        "In the printer driver 8, we use JPEG compression 9 to compress the contone data. Although JPEG is inherently lossy, for compression ratios of 10:1 or less the loss is usually negligible [17]. To obtain an integral contone to bi-level ratio, and to provide some compression leeway, we choose a contone resolution of 267 ppi. This yields a contone CMYK pagesize of 25.5 MB, a corresponding compression ratio of 8.5:1 to fit within the 3 MB/page limit, and a contone to bi-level ratio of 1:6 in each dimension.",
        "A full page of black text (and/or graphics) rasterized at printer resolution (1600 dpi) yields a bi-level image of 28.6 MB. Since rasterizing text at 1600 dpi places a heavy burden on the PC for a small gain, we choose to rasterize text at a fully acceptable 800 dpi. This yields a bi-level image of 7.1 MB, requiring a lossless compression ratio of less than 2.5:1 to fit within the 3 MB/page limit. We achieve this with a two-dimensional compression scheme adapted from Group 4 Facsimile, all indicated generally at 10.",
        "As long as the image and text regions of a page are non-overlapping, any combination of the two fits  within the 3 MB limit. If text lies on top of a background image, then the worst case is a compressed pagesize approaching 6 MB (depending on the actual text compression ratio). This fits within the printer's page buffer memory, but prevents double-buffering of pages in the printer, thereby reducing the printer's page rate by two-thirds, i.e. to 10 pages/minute.",
        "3.3 Page Expansion and Printing",
        "As described above, the PC renders contone images and graphics to the pixel level, and black text and graphics to the dot level. These are compressed 11 by different means and transmitted together to the printer.",
        "The printer contains two 3 MB page buffers\u2014one 12 for the page being received from the PC, and one 13 for the page being printed. The printer expands the compressed page as it is being printed. This expansion consists of decompressing the 267 ppi contone CMYK image data 14, halftoning the resulting contone pixels to 1600 dpi bi-level CMYK dots 15, decompressing the 800 dpi bi-level black text data 16, and compositing the resulting bi-level black text dots over the corresponding bi-level CMYK image dots 17.",
        "The conceptual data flow from the application to the printed page is illustrated in FIG. 2.",
        "4 Printer Hardware",
        "Because of the simplicity of the page width MEMJET printhead, iPrint is very compact. It measures just 270 mm wide\u00d785 mm deep\u00d777 mm high when closed. FIG. 3 is a pictorial view of the iPrint 21 when closed.",
        "The cover 22 opens to form part of the paper tray, as shown in FIG. 4. A second part 23 is hinged within cover 22 and opens to extend the paper tray. A paper exit tray 24 is slideably extendable from the front of the printer.",
        "The front panel 25, revealed when cover 22 is opened, contains the user interface\u2014the power button 26 and power indicator LED 27, the paper feed button 28, and the out-of-paper 29 and ink low 30 LEDs.",
        "4.1 Paper Path",
        "iPrint uses a standard paper transport mechanism. The paper path 50 is illustrated in FIG. 5, in which a single stepper motor 51 drives both the sheet feed roller 52 and the paper transport. When running in the forward direction the stepper motor drives the paper drive roller 53 and the pinch wheels 54 at the start and end of the active paper path, respectively. When reversed, the stepper motor drives the sheet feed roller 52 which grabs the topmost sheet from the sheet feeder and transports it the short distance to the paper drive roller 53 where it is detected by the mechanical media sensor 55.",
        "The paper centering sliders 56 ensure that the paper is centered. This ensures that a single centered media sensor detects the sheet, and also ensures that sheets wider than the printhead are printed with balanced margins.",
        "4.1.1 MEMJET Printhead",
        "The replaceable MEMJET printhead cartridge 60 is also shown in FIG. 5. This represents one of the four possible ways to deploy the printhead in conjunction with the ink cartridge in a product such as iPrint:\n\n    permanent printhead, replaceable ink cartridge (as shown here)\n    separate replaceable printhead and ink cartridges\n    refillable combined printhead and ink cartridge\n    disposable combined printhead and ink cartridge",
        "Under the printhead cartridge 60 is a printhead assembly 61 and a printhead capping mechanism 62, illustrated in pictorial cut away view in FIG. 6 and in section in FIG. 7. When not in use, the MEMJET printhead 63 remains filled with ink, and so must be capped to prevent evaporation of ink through the nozzles. Ink evaporation can lead to gradual deposition of ink components which can impair nozzle operation.",
        "iPrint includes a mechanical page width capping mechanism 62 which consists of a pivoting capping molding 64 with an elastomeric seal 65 and sponge 66. When the printhead is not in use, the capping molding 64 is held by a spring against the face of the printhead assembly 61, and the elastomeric seal 65 conforms to the face of the printhead assembly and creates an airtight seal around the printhead 63. The sponge 66 is used to catch drops ejected during the printhead cleaning cycle. When the printhead is in use, the capping molding 64 is held away from the printhead assembly 61 and out of the paper path.",
        "The capping molding 64 is offset by a set of flexible arms 68 from a rod 69. The capping molding 64 and arms 68 pivot with the rod 69 about its axis. A slip wheel 70 is mounted at the end of rod 69. The slip wheel 70 makes contact with a drive wheel 71. When printing is occurring, the drive wheel 71 is coupled to the paper transport motor and is driven in the uncapping direction 72. This causes the slip wheel 70 and rod 69 to rotate about its axis and swings the capping molding 64 away from the printhead. Once the slip wheel rotates to the uncapping slip point 73, the slip wheel and the capping molding stop rotating. When printing is complete, the drive wheel is reversed and driven in the capping direction 74. Once the slip wheel rotates to the capping slip point 75, the slip wheel and the capping molding stop rotating, and the capping spring holds the capping plate in place against the face of the printhead assembly. The flexible arms 68 help the capping plate 67 conform to the face of the printhead assembly 61.",
        "4.2 Printer Controller",
        "The printer controller 80 is illustrated in FIG. 8, and consists of a small PCB 81 with only a few components\u2014a 64 Mbit RDRAM 82, the iPrint Central Processor (ICP) chip 83, a speaker 84 for notifying the user of error conditions, a QA chip 85, an external 3V DC power connection 86, an external USB connection 87, a connection 88 to the paper transport stepper motor 51, and the flex PCB 89 which connects to the media sensor 55, LEDs 27, 29 and 30, buttons 26 and 28, and a link 90 the printhead 63.",
        "4.3 Ink Cartridge and Ink Path",
        "There are two versions of the ink cartridge\u2014one large, one small. Both fit in the same ink cartridge slot at the back of the iPrint unit.",
        "5 Printer Control Protocol",
        "This section describes the printer control protocol used between a host and iPrint. It includes control and status handling as well as the actual page description.",
        "5.1 Control and Status",
        "The USB device class definition for printers [16] provides for emulation of both unidirectional and bidirectional IEEE 1284 parallel ports [3].

        "The Group 3 Facsimile compression algorithm [1] losslessly compresses bi-level data for transmission over slow and noisy telephone lines. The bi-level data represents scanned black text and graphics on a white background, and the algorithm is tuned for this class of images (it is explicitly not tuned, for example, for halftoned bi-level images). The 1D Group 3 algorithm runlength-encodes each scanline and then Huffman-encodes the resulting runlengths. Runlengths in the range 0 to 63 are coded with terminating codes. Runlengths in the range 64 to 2623 are coded with make-up codes, each representing a multiple of 64, followed by a terminating code. Runlengths exceeding 2623 are coded with multiple make-up codes followed by a terminating code. The Huffman tables are fixed, but are separately tuned for black and white runs (except for make-up codes above 1728, which are common). When possible, the 2D Group 3 algorithm encodes a scanline as a set of short edge deltas (0, \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13) with reference to the previous scanline. The delta symbols are entropy-encoded (so that the zero delta symbol is only one bit long etc.) Edges within a 2D-encoded line which can't be delta-encoded are runlength-encoded, and are identified by a prefix. 1D- and 2D-encoded lines are marked differently. 1D-encoded lines are generated at regular intervals, whether actually required or not, to ensure that the decoder can recover from line noise with minimal image degradation. 2D Group 3 achieves compression ratios of up to 6:1 [14].",
        "The Group 4 Facsimile algorithm [1] losslessly compresses bi-level data for transmission over error-free communications lines (i.e. the lines are truly error-free, or error-correction is done at a lower protocol level). The Group 4 algorithm is based on the 2D Group 3 algorithm, with the essential modification that since transmission is assumed to be error-free, ID-encoded lines are no longer generated at regular intervals as an aid to error-recovery. Group 4 achieves compression ratios ranging from 20:1 to 60:1 for the CCITT set of test images [14].",
        "The design goals and performance of the Group 4 compression algorithm qualify it as a compression algorithm for the bi-level black layer. However, its Huffman tables are tuned to a lower scanning resolution (100-400 dpi), and it encodes runlengths exceeding 2623 awkwardly. At 800 dpi, our maximum runlength is currently 6400. Although a Group 4 decoder core might be available for use in the printer controller chip (Section 7), it might not handle runlengths exceeding those normally encountered in 400 dpi facsimile applications, and so would require modification.",
        "Since most of the benefit of Group 4 comes from the delta-encoding, a simpler algorithm based on delta-encoding alone is likely to meet our requirements. This approach is described in detail below.",
        "5.2.3.2 Bi-Level Edge Delta and Runlength (EDRL) Compression Format",
        "The edge delta and runlength (EDRL) compression format is based loosely on the Group 4 compression format and its precursors [1][18].",
        "EDRL uses three kinds of symbols, appropriately entropy-coded. These are create edge, kill edge, and edge delta. Each line is coded with reference to its predecessor. The predecessor of the first line is defined to a line of white. Each line is defined to start off white. If a line actually starts of black (the less likely situation), then it must define a black edge at offset zero. Each line must define an edge at its left-hand end, i.e. at offset page width.",
        "An edge can be coded with reference to an edge in the previous line if there is an edge within the maximum delta range with the same sense (white-to-black or black-to-white). This uses one of the edge delta codes. The shorter and likelier deltas have the shorter codes. The maximum delta range (\u00b12) is chosen to match the distribution of deltas for typical glyph edges. This distribution is mostly independent of point size. A typical example is given in Table 3.",

        "An edge can also be coded using the length of the run from the previous edge in the same line. This uses one of the create edge codes for short (7-bit) and long (13-bit) runlengths. For simplicity, and unlike Group 4, runlengths are not entropy-coded. In order to keep edge deltas implicitly synchronised with edges in the previous line, each unused edge in the previous line is \u2018killed\u2019 when passed in the current line. This uses the kill edge code. The end-of-page code signals the end of the page to the decoder.",
        "Note that 7-bit and 13-bit runlengths are specifically chosen to support 800 dpi A4/Letter pages. Longer runlengths could be supported without significant impact on compression performance. For example, if supporting 1600 dpi compression, the runlengths should be at least 8-bit and 14-bit respectively. A general-purpose choice might be 8-bit and 16-bit, thus supporting up to 40\u2033 wide 1600 dpi pages.",
        "The full set of codes is defined in Table 4. Note that there is no end-of-line code. The decoder uses the page width to detect the end of the line. The lengths of the codes are ordered by the relative probabilities of the codes' occurrence.",

Note that the common situation of an all-white line following another all-white line is coded using a single bit (\u03940), and an all-black line following another all-black line is coded using two bits (\u03940, \u03940).

        "JPEG typically first transforms the image into a color space which separates luminance and chrominance into separate color channels. This allows the chrominance channels to be subsampled without appreciable loss because of the human visual system's relatively greater sensitivity to luminance than chrominance. After this first step, each color channel is compressed separately.",
        "The image is divided into 8\u00d78 pixel blocks. Each block is then transformed into the frequency domain via a discrete cosine transform (DCT). This transformation has the effect of concentrating image energy in relatively lower-frequency coefficients, which allows higher-frequency coefficients to be more crudely quantized. This quantization is the principal source of compression in JPEG. Further compression is achieved by ordering coefficients by frequency to maximise the likelihood of adjacent zero coefficients, and then runlength-encoding runs of zeroes. Finally, the runlengths and non-zero frequency coefficients are entropy coded. Decompression is the inverse process of compression.",

The exact distance between different color pods depends on the MEMJET operating parameters, and may vary from one MEMJET design to another.

A single pulse on the SRClock line (shared between all 8 segments) transfers the 32 bits into the appropriate shift registers. Alternate pulses transfer bits to the lower and upper nozzles respectively. Since there are 25,600 nozzles, a total of 800 pulses are required for the transfer. Once all 25,600 bits have been transferred, a single pulse on the shared PTransfer line causes the parallel transfer of data from the shift registers to the appropriate NozzleEnable bits.",

        "Since all 8 segments are loaded with a single SRClock pulse, any printing process must produce the data in the correct sequence for the printhead. As an example, the first SRClock pulse will transfer the CMYK bits for the next Print Cycle's dot 0, 800, 1600, 2400, 3200, 4000, 4800, and 5600. The second SRClock pulse will transfer the CMYK bits for the next Print Cycle's dot 1, 801, 1601, 2401, 3201, 4001, 4801 and 5601. After 800 SRClock pulses, the PTransfer pulse can be given.",
        "It is important to note that the odd and even CMYK outputs, although printed during the same Print Cycle, do not appear on the same physical output line. The physical separation of odd and even nozzles within the printhead, as well as separation between nozzles of different colors ensures that they will produce dots on different lines of the page. This relative difference must be accounted for when loading the data into the printhead. The actual difference in lines depends on the characteristics of the inkjet mechanism used in the printhead.

The typical duration of a firing pulse is 1.3-1.8 Ts. The duration of a pulse depends on the viscosity of the ink (dependent on temperature and ink characteristics) and the amount of power available to the printhead. See Section 6.1.3 for details on feedback from the printhead in order to compensate for temperature change.",

In the high-speed print mode, the time to print a line is 100 Ts, so the time between firing a nozzle from one line to the next matches the refill time. The low-speed print mode is slower than this, so is also acceptable.",

The perturbations can interfere with the firing of another nozzle within the same pod. Consequently, the firing of nozzles within a pod should be offset from each other as long as possible. We therefore fire four nozzles from a chromapod (one nozzle per color) and then move onto the next chromapod within the podgroup.",

The feedback sense lines will come from the selected segment until the next SenseSegSelect pulse. The feedback sense lines are as follows:\n\n    Tsense informs the controller how hot the printhead is. This allows the controller to adjust timing of firing pulses, since temperature affects the viscosity of the ink.\n    Vsense informs the controller how much voltage is available to the actuator. This allows the controller to compensate for a flat battery or high voltage source by adjusting the pulse width.\n    Rsense informs the controller of the resistivity (Ohms per square) of the actuator heater. This allows the controller to adjust the pulse widths to maintain a constant energy irrespective of the heater resistivity.\n    Wsense informs the controller of the width of the critical part of the heater, which may vary up to \u00b15% due to lithographic and etching variations. This allows the controller to adjust the pulse width appropriately.\n\n6.1.4 Preheat Cycle",

Depending on the desired speed for the output image to be printed, data must be generated and transferred at appropriate speeds in order to keep up.",
        "As an example, consider the timing of printing an 8\u2033\u00d712\u2033 page in 2 seconds. In order to print this page in 2 seconds, the 8-inch printhead must print 19,200 lines (12\u00d71600). Rounding up to 20,000 lines in 2 seconds yields a line time of 100 Ts. A single Print Cycle and a single Load Cycle must both finish within this time. In addition, a physical process external to the printhead must move the paper an appropriate amount.",

Both 4-inch printheads must therefore be run in high-speed print mode to print simultaneously. Therefore 512 nozzles fire per firing pulse, thereby enabling the printing of an 8-inch line within the specified time.",
        "The 800 SRClock pulses to both 4-inch printheads (each clock pulse transferring 32 bits) must also take place within the 100 T line time. If both printheads are loaded simultaneously (64 data lines), the length of an SRClock pulse cannot exceed 100 Ts/800=125 nanoseconds, indicating that the printhead must be clocked at 8 MHz. If the two printheads are loaded one at a time (32 shared data lines), the length of an SRClock pulse cannot exceed 100 Ts/1600=62.5 nanoseconds. The printhead must therefore be clocked at 16 MHz. In both instances, the average time to calculate each bit value (for each of the 51,200 nozzles) must not exceed 100 Ts/51,200=2 nanoseconds. This requires a dot generator running at one of the following speeds:\n\n    500 MHz generating 1 bit (dot) per cycle\n    250 MHz generating 2 bits (dots) per cycle\n    125 MHz generating 4 bits (dots) per cycle\n\n7 Printer Controller\n\n7.1 Printer Controller Architecture",

        "Page expansion and printing proceeds as follows. A page description is received from the host via the USB interface 146 and is stored in main memory. 6 MB of main memory is dedicated to page storage. This can hold two pages each not exceeding 3 MB, or one page up to 6 MB. If the host generates pages not exceeding 3 MB, then the printer operates in streaming mode\u2014i.e. it prints one page while receiving the next. If the host generates pages exceeding 3 MB, then the printer operates in single-page mode\u2014i.e. it receives each page and prints it before receiving the next. If the host generates pages exceeding 6 MB then they are rejected by the printer. In practice the printer driver prevents this from happening.",
        "A page consists of two parts\u2014the bi-level black layer, and the contone layer. These are compressed in distinct formats\u2014the bi-level black layer in EDRL format, the contone layer in JPEG format. The first stage of page expansion consists of decompressing the two layers in parallel. The bi-level layer is decompressed 16 by the EDRL expander unit 140, the contone layer 14 by the JPEG decoder 143.",
        "The second stage of page expansion consists of halftoning 15 the contone CMYK data to bi-level CMYK, and then compositing 17 the bi-level black layer over the bi-level CMYK layer. The halftoning and compositing is carried out by the halftoner/compositor unit 141.",
        "Finally, the composited bi-level CMYK image is printed 18 via the printhead interface unit 142, which controls the MEMJET printhead.",
        "Because the MEMJET printhead prints at high speed, the paper must move past the printhead at a constant velocity. If the paper is stopped because data can't be fed to the printhead fast enough, then visible printing irregularities will occur. It is therefore important to transfer bi-level CMYK data to the printhead interface at the required rate.",
        "A fully-expanded 1600 dpi bi-level CMYK page has a size of 114.3 MB. Because it is impractical to store an expanded page in printer memory, each page is expanded in real time during printing. Thus the various stages of page expansion and printing are pipelined. The page expansion and printing data flow is described in Table 14. The aggregate traffic to/from main memory of 174 MB/s is well within the capabilities of current technologies such as Rambus.",

Each edge in each line is coded relative to an edge in the previous line, or relative to the previous edge in the same line. No matter how it is coded, each edge is ultimately decoded to its distance from the previous edge in the same line. This distance, or runlength, is then decoded to the string of one bits or zero bits which represent the corresponding part of the image. The decompression algorithm is also defined in Section 5.2.3.2.",
        "The EEU consists of a bitstream decoder 154, a state machine 155, edge calculation logic 156, two runlength decoders 157 and 158, and a runlength (re)encoder 159.",
        "The bitstream decoder 154 decodes an entropy-coded codeword from the bitstream and passes it to the state machine 155. The state machine 155 returns the size of the codeword to the bitstream decoder 154, which allows the decoder 154 to advance to the next codeword. In the case of a create edge code, the state machine 155 uses the bitstream decoder to extract the corresponding runlength from the bitstream. The state machine controls the edge calculation logic and runlength decoding/encoding as defined in Table 18.",
        "The edge calculation logic is quite simple. The current edge offset in the previous (reference) and current (coding) lines are maintained in the reference edge register 160 and edge register 161 respectively. The runlength associated with a create edge code is output directly to the runlength decoders, and is added to the current edge. A delta code is translated into a runlength by adding the associated delta to the reference edge and subtracting the current edge. The generated runlength is output to the runlength decoders, and is added to the current edge. The next runlength is extracted from the runlength encoder 159 and added to the reference edge 160. A kill edge code simply causes the current reference edge to be skipped. Again the next runlength is extracted from the runlength encoder and added to the reference edge.",
        "Each time the edge calculation logic 156 generates a runlength representing an edge, it is passed to the runlength decoders. While the runlength decoder decodes the run it generates a stall signal to the state machine. Since the runlength decoder 157 is slower than the edge calculation logic, there's not much point in decoupling it. The expanded line accumulates in a line buffer 162 large enough to hold an 8\u2033 800 dpi line (800 bytes).",
        "The previously expanded line is also buffered 163. It acts as a reference for the decoding of the current line. The previous line is re-encoded as runlengths on demand. This is less expensive than buffering the decoded runlengths of the previous line, since the worst case is one 13-bit runlength for each pixel (20 KB at 1600 dpi). While the runlength encoder 159 encodes the run it generates a stall signal to the state machine. The runlength encoder uses the page width 152 to detect end-of-line. The (current) line buffer 162 and the previous line buffer 163 are concatenated and managed as a single FIFO to simplify the runlength encoder 159.",
        "Runlength decoder 158 decodes the output runlength to a line buffer 164 large enough to hold an 8\u2033 1600 dpi line (1600 bytes). The runlength passed to this output runlength decoder is multiplied by the scale factor 153, so this decoder produces 1600 dpi lines. The line is output scale factor times through the output pixel FIFO 165. This achieves the required vertical scaling by simple line replication. The EEU could be designed with edge smoothing integrated into its image scaling. A simple smoothing scheme based on template-matching can be very effective [10]. This would require a multi-line buffer between the low-resolution runlength decoder and the smooth scaling unit, but would eliminate the high-resolution runlength decoder.",

We do this 16 times to retrieve the two sets of 32 bits for the two sets of 8 segments representing the even dots (the resultant data is transferred to the MJI 32 bits at a time) and another 16 times to load the odd dots. This 32-cycle process is repeated 400 times, incrementing the start address each time.

The solution is to transfer the first 32-bit value to the Transfer register after 8 cycles, and then to stall 8-cycles later, waiting for the Advance pulse to start the next 8-cycle group. Once the first Advance pulse arrives, the LLFU is synchronized to the MJI.

The color profile is normally selected implicitly by the user when the user specifies the output medium in the printer (i.e. plain paper, coated paper, transparency, etc.). The page description sent to the printer always contains device-specific CMYK color.",
        "We assume that the host graphics system renders images and graphics to a nominal resolution specified by the printer driver, but that it allows the printer driver to take control of rendering text. In particular, the graphics system provides sufficient information to the printer driver to allow it to render and position text at a higher resolution than the nominal device resolution.",
        "We assume that the host graphics system requires random access to a contone page buffer at the nominal device resolution, into which it composites graphics and imaging objects, but that it allows the printer driver to take control of the actual compositing\u2014i.e. it expects the printer driver to manage the page buffer.",
        "8.2 Two-Layer Page Buffer",
        "The printer's page description contains a 267 ppi contone layer and an 800 dpi black layer. The black layer is conceptually above the contone layer, i.e. the black layer is composited over the contone layer by the printer. The printer driver therefore maintains a page buffer 260 which correspondingly contains a medium-resolution contone layer 261 and a high-resolution black layer 262.",
        "The graphics systems renders and composites objects into the page buffer bottom-up\u2014i.e. later objects obscure earlier objects. This works naturally when there is only a single layer, but not when there are two layers which will be composited later. It is therefore necessary to detect when an object being placed on the contone layer obscures something on the black layer.",
        "When obscuration is detected, the obscured black pixels are composited with the contone layer and removed from the black layer. The obscuring object is then laid down on the contone layer, possibly interacting with the black pixels in some way. If the compositing mode of the obscuring object is such that no interaction with the background is possible, then the black pixels can simply be discarded without being composited with the contone layer. In practice, of course, there is little interaction between the contone layer and the black layer.",
        "The printer driver specifies a nominal page resolution of 267 ppi to the graphics system. Where possible the printer driver relies on the graphics system to render image and graphics objects to the pixel level at 267 ppi, with the exception of black text. The printer driver fields all text rendering requests, detects and renders black text at 800 dpi, but returns non-black text rendering requests to the graphics system for rendering at 267 ppi.",
        "Ideally the graphics system and the printer driver manipulate color in device-independent RGB, deferring conversion to device-specific CMYK until the page is complete and ready to be sent to the printer. This reduces page buffer requirements and makes compositing more rational. Compositing in CMYK color space is not ideal.",
        "Ultimately the graphics system asks the printer driver to composite each rendered object into the printer driver's page buffer. Each such object uses 24-bit contone RGB, and has an explicit (or implicitly opaque) opacity channel.",
        "The printer driver maintains the two-layer page buffer 260 in three parts. The first part is the medium-resolution (267 ppi) contone layer 261. This consists of a 24-bit RGB bitmap. The second part is a medium-resolution black layer 263. This consists of an 8-bit opacity bitmap. The third part is a high-resolution (800 dpi) black layer 262. This consists of a 1-bit opacity bitmap. The medium-resolution black layer is a subsampled version of the high-resolution opacity layer. In practice, assuming the medium resolution is an integer factor n of the high resolution (e.g. n=800/267=3), each medium-resolution opacity value is obtained by averaging the corresponding n\u00d7n high-resolution opacity values. This corresponds to box-filtered subsampling. The subsampling of the black pixels effectively antialiases edges in the high-resolution black layer, thereby reducing ringing artefacts when the contone layer is subsequently JPEG-compressed and decompressed.",

Since the contone object obscures part of the existing black object, the affected parts of the existing bi-level object are removed from the foreground black layer 302 (Rule 4). There is no need to composite the affected parts into the contone layer because the contone object is fully opaque, and Rule 3 is therefore skipped. The contone object is composited into the background contone layer as usual 303 (Rule 6), and the output image 304 shows the contone object 300 over, and obscuring, the black object.",

        "The printer driver then compresses and packages the black layer and the contone layer into an iPrint page description as described in Section 5.2. This page description is delivered to the printer via the standard spooler.",
        "Note that the black layer is manipulated as a set of 1-bit opacity values, but is delivered to the printer as a set of 1-bit black values. Although these two interpretations are different, they share the same representation, and so no data conversion is required.",
        "9 Windows 9X/NT Printer Driver",
        "9.1 Windows 9x/NT Printing System",
        "In the Windows 9x/NT printing system [8][9], a printer 320 is a graphics device, and an application 321 communicates with it via the graphics device interface 322 (GDI). The printer driver graphics DLL 323 (dynamic link library) implements the device-dependent aspects of the various graphics functions provided by GDI.",
        "The spooler 333 handles the delivery of pages to the printer, and may reside on a different machine to the application requesting printing. It delivers pages to the printer via aport monitor 334 which handles the physical connection to the printer. The optional language monitor 335 is the part of the printer driver which imposes additional protocol on communication with the printer, and in particular decodes status responses from the printer on behalf of the spooler.",
        "The printer driver user interface DLL 336 implements the user interface for editing printer-specific properties and reporting printer-specific events.",
        "The structure of the Windows 9x/NT printing system is illustrated in FIG. 42.",
        "Since iPrint uses USB IEEE-1284 emulation, there is no need to implement a language monitor for iPrint.",
        "The remainder of this section describes the design of the printer driver graphics DLL. It should be read in conjunction with the appropriate Windows 9x/NT DDK documentation [8][9].",
        "9.2 Windows 9x/NT Graphics Device Interface (GDI)",
        "GDI provides functions which allow an application to draw on a device surface, i.e. typically an abstraction of a display screen or a printed page. For a raster device, the device surface is conceptually a color bitmap. The application can draw on the surface in a device-independent way, i.e. independently of the resolution and color characteristics of the device.",
        "The application has random access to the entire device surface. This means that if a memory-limited printer device requires banded output, then GDI must buffer the entire page's GDI commands and replay them windowed into each band in turn. Although this provides the application with great flexibility, it can adversely affect performance.",
        "GDI supports color management, whereby device-independent colors provided by the application are transparently translated into device-dependent colors according to a standard ICC (International Color Consortium) color profile of the device. A printer driver can activate a different color profile depending, for example, on the user's selection of paper type on the driver-managed printer property sheet.",
        "GDI supports line and spline outline graphics (paths), images, and text. Outline graphics, including outline font glyphs, can be stroked and filled with bit-mapped brush patterns. Graphics and images can be geometrically transformed and composited with the contents of the device surface. While Windows 95/NT4 provides only boolean compositing operators, Windows 98/NT5 provides proper alpha-blending [9].",
        "9.3 Printer Driver Graphics DLL",
        "A raster printer can, in theory, utilize standard printer driver components under Windows 9x/NT, and this can make the job of developing a printer driver trivial. This relies on being able to model the device surface as a single bitmap. The problem with this is that text and images must be rendered at the same resolution. This either compromises text resolution, or generates too much output data, compromising performance.",
        "As described earlier, iPrint's approach is to render black text and images at different resolutions, to optimize the reproduction of each. The printer driver is therefore implemented according to the generic design described in Section 8.",
        "The driver therefore maintains a two-layer three-part page buffer as described in Section 8.2, and this means that the printer driver must take over managing the device surface, which in turn means that it must mediate all GDI access to the device surface.",
        "9.3.1 Managing the Device Surface",
        "The printer driver must support a number of standard functions, including the following:",
        "TABLE 33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard graphics driver interface functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunction\ndescription\n\n\n\n\n\nDrvEnableDriver\nInitial entry point into the driver\n\n\n\ngraphics DLL.

        "DrvEnablePDEV indicates to GDI, via the flGraphicsCaps member of the returned DEVINFO structure, the graphics rendering capabilities of the driver. This is discussed further below.",
        "DrvEnableSurface creates a device surface consisting of two conceptual layers and three parts: the 267 ppi contone layer 24-bit RGB color, the 267 ppi black layer 8-bit opacity, and the 800 dpi black layer 1-bit opacity. The virtual device surface which encapsulates these two layers has a nominal resolution of 267 ppi, so this is the resolution at which GDI operations take place.",
        "Although the aggregate page buffer requires about 33 MB of memory, the PC 99 office standard [5] specifies a minimum of 64 MB.",
        "In practice, managing the device surface and mediating GDI access to it means that the printer driver must support the following additional functions:",
        "TABLE 34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired graphics driver functions for a device-managed surface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunction\ndescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrvCopyBits\nTranslates between device-managed raster\n\n\n\n\nsurfaces and GDI-managed standard-format\n\n\n\n\nbitmaps.\n\n\n\nDrvStrokePath\nStrokes a path.\n\n\n\nDrvPaint\nPaints a specified region.\n\n\n\nDrvTextOut\nRenders a set of glyphs at specified positions.",
        "Copying images, stroking paths and filling regions all occur on the contone layer, while rendering solid black text occurs on the bi-level black layer. Furthermore, rendering non-black text also occurs on the contone layer, since it isn't supported on the black layer. Conversely, stroking or filling with solid black can occur on the black layer (if we so choose).",
        "Although the printer driver is obliged to hook the aforementioned functions, it can punt function calls which apply to the contone layer back to the corresponding GDI implementations of the functions, since the contone layer is a standard-format bitmap. For every DrvXxx function there is a corresponding EngXxx function provided by GDI.",
        "As described in Section 8.2, when an object destined for the contone layer obscures pixels on the black layer, the obscured black pixels must be transferred from the black layer to the contone layer before the contone object is composited with the contone layer. The key to this process working is that obscuration is detected and handled in the hooked call, before it is punted back to GDI. This involves determining the pixel-by-pixel opacity of the contone object from its geometry, and using this opacity to selectively transfer black pixels from the black layer to the contone layer as described in Section 8.2.",
        "9.3.2 Determining Contone Object Geometry",
        "It is possible to determine the geometry of each contone object before it is rendered and thus determine efficiently which black pixels it obscures. In the case of DrvCopyBits and DrvPaint, the geometry is determined by a clip object (CLIPOBJ), which can be enumerated as a set of rectangles.",
        "In the case of DrvStrokePath, things are more complicated. DrvStrokePath supports both straight-line and Bezier-spline curve segments, and single-pixel-wide lines and geometric-wide lines. The first step is to avoid the complexity of Bezier-spline curve segments and geometric-wide lines altogether by clearing the corresponding capability flags (GCAPS_BEZIERS and GCAPS_GEOMETRICWIDE) in the flGraphicsCaps member of the driver's DEVINFO structure. This causes GDI to reformulate such calls as sets of simpler calls to DrvPaint. In general, GDI gives a driver the opportunity to accelerate high-level capabilities, but simulates any capabilities not provided by the driver.",
        "What remains is simply to determine the geometry of a single-pixel-wide straight line. Such a line can be solid or cosmetic. In the latter case, the line style is determined by a styling array in the specified line attributes (LINEATTRS). The styling array specifies how the line alternates between being opaque and transparent along its length, and so supports various dashed line effects etc.",
        "When the brush is solid black, straight lines can also usefully be rendered to the black layer, though with the increased width implied by the 800 dpi resolution.",
        "9.3.3 Rendering Text",
        "In the case of a DrvTextOut, things are also more complicated. Firstly, the opaque background, if any, is handled like any other fill on the contone layer (see DrvPaint). If the foreground brush is not black, or the mix mode is not effectively opaque, or the font is not scalable, or the font indicates outline stroking, then the call is punted to EngTextOut, to be applied to the contone layer. Before the call is punted, however, the driver determines the geometry of each glyph by obtaining its bitmap (via FONTOBJ_cGetGlyphs), and makes the usual obscuration check against the black layer.",
        "If punting a DrvTextOut call is not allowed (the documentation is ambiguous), then the driver should disallow complex text operations. This includes disallowing outline stroking (by clearing the GCAPS_VECTOR_FONT capability flag), and disallowing complex mix modes (by clearing the GCAPS_ARBMIXTXT capability flag).",
        "If the foreground brush is black and opaque, and the font is scalable and not stroked, then the glyphs are rendered on the black layer. In this case the driver determines the geometry of each glyph by obtaining its outline (again via FONTOBJ_cGetGlyphs, but as a PATHOBJ). The driver then renders each glyph from its outline at 800 dpi and writes it to the black layer. Although the outline geometry uses device coordinates (i.e. at 267 ppi), the coordinates are in fixed point format with plenty of fractional precision for higher-resolution rendering.",
        "Note that strikethrough and underline rectangles are added to the glyph geometry, if specified.",
        "The driver must set the GCAPS_HIGHRESTEXT flag in the DEVINFO to request that glyph positions (again in 267 ppi device coordinates) be supplied by GDI in high-precision fixed-point format, to allow accurate positioning at 800 dpi. The driver must also provide an implementation of the DrvGetGlyphMode function, so that it can indicate to GDI that glyphs should be cached as outlines rather than bitmaps. Ideally the driver should cache rendered glyph bitmaps for efficiency, memory allowing. Only glyphs below a certain point size should be cached.",
        "9.3.4 Compressing the Contone Layer",
        "As described earlier, the contone layer is compressed using JPEG. The forward discrete cosine transform (DCT) is the costliest part of JPEG compression. In current high-quality software implementations, the forward DCT of each 8\u00d78 block requires 12 integer multiplications and 32 integer additions [7]. On a Pentium processor, an integer multiplication requires 10 cycles, and an integer addition requires 2 cycles [11]. This equates to a total cost per block of 184 cycles.",
        "The 25.5 MB contone layer consists of 417,588 JPEG blocks, giving an overall forward DCT cost of about 77 Mcycles. At 300 MHz, the PC 99 desktop standard [5], this equates to 0.26 seconds, which is well within the 2 second limit per page.",
