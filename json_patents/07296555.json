        "The invention relates generally to a system and method for operating a turbo-charged compression-ignition engine and, more specifically, to a system and method for reducing specific fuel consumption and engine exhaust emission in a turbo-charged diesel engine in a locomotive.",
        "In a compression-ignition engine, such as a diesel engine, a fuel injection system injects fuel (e.g. diesel fuel) into compressed air within each of the engine cylinders to create an air-fuel mixture that ignites due to the heat and pressure of compression. Unfortunately, engine efficiency, power output, fuel consumption, exhaust emissions, and other operational characteristics are less than ideal. In addition, conventional techniques to improve one operational characteristic often worsen one or more other operational characteristic. For example, attempts to decrease specific fuel consumption often cause increases in various exhaust emissions. Vehicle exhaust emissions include pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and smoke generated due to incomplete combustion of fuel within the combustion chamber. The amount of these pollutants varies depending on the fuel-air mixture, compression ratio, injection timing, ambient conditions, and so forth.",
        "Therefore, a technique is needed for reducing specific fuel consumption without increasing certain exhaust emissions, such as NOx, in a turbo-charged diesel engine.",
        "In accordance with one aspect of the present technique, a method includes injecting a first quantity of fuel into an engine cylinder at a first predetermined time during a second half of a compression stroke before a piston of the engine cylinder reaches top dead center of the compression stroke. The method further includes injecting a second quantity of fuel into the engine cylinder at a second predetermined time after the first predetermined time when the piston is advanced by a predetermined advance value before the piston reaches the top dead center of the compression stroke.",
        "In accordance with another aspect of the present technique, a method includes advancing fuel injection by a predetermined advance value to reduce specific fuel consumption in a compression-ignition engine of a locomotive. The method further includes splitting the fuel injection of a predetermined quantity of fuel into a pilot fuel quantity and a majority fuel quantity during a second half of a compression stroke and before top dead center of the compression stroke of the compression-ignition engine to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions associated with advancing the fuel injection.",
        "In accordance with another aspect of the present technique, a system includes a controller configured to inject a first quantity of fuel into an engine cylinder at a first predetermined time during a second half of a compression stroke before a piston of the engine cylinder reaches top dead center of the compression stroke and configured to inject a second quantity of fuel into the engine cylinder at a second predetermined time after the first predetermined time when the piston is advanced by a predetermined advance value before the piston reaches the top dead center of the compression stroke.",

        "Referring to FIG. 1, a turbocharged system 10 having engine exhaust emission and specific fuel consumption reduction logic 11 is illustrated in accordance with certain embodiments of the present technique. In the illustrated embodiment, the turbocharged system 10 is a locomotive power unit. In other embodiments, the power unit may be used for other medium speed engine applications as known to those skilled in the art. The locomotive power unit 10 includes a turbocharger 12 and a compression-ignition engine, e.g. diesel engine 14. As discussed in further detail below, embodiments of the present technique provide monitoring and control features, such as sensors and control logic, to control engine exhaust emissions and specific fuel consumption (SFC) within the locomotive power unit 10. For example, the engine exhaust emissions are controlled and the specific fuel consumption is reduced by splitting fuel injection of a predetermined quantity into a pilot fuel injection and an advanced main fuel injection during a second half of a compression stroke and before top dead center position of the compression stroke of the engine 14 based on operating conditions of the engine 14 such as engine speed, crank angle, common rail pressure, or the like. In accordance with the embodiments of the present technique, second half of the compression stroke relates to a crank angle of 90 degrees before top dead center of the compression stroke. The injection operation includes splitting the fuel injection into the pilot fuel injection and the main fuel injection, providing larger fuel quantity in the main injection event, advancing the main injection event by a predetermined value, and adjusting timing between the pilot injection and the main injection.",
        "The illustrated engine 14 includes an air intake manifold 16 and an exhaust manifold 18. The turbocharger 12 includes a compressor 20 and a turbine 22 and is operated to supply compressed air to the intake manifold 16 for combustion within a cylinder 24. The turbine 22 is coupled to the exhaust manifold 18. The exhaust gases ejected from the exhaust manifold 18 are expanded through the turbine 22, thereby forcing rotation of a turbocharger shaft 26 connected to the compressor 20. The compressor 20 draws in ambient air through an air filter 28 and provides compressed air to a heat exchanger 30. The temperature of air is increased due to compression through the compressor 20. The compressed air flows through the heat exchanger 30 such that the temperature of air is reduced prior to delivery into the intake manifold 16 of the engine 14. In one embodiment, the heat exchanger 30 is an air-to-water heat exchanger, which utilizes a coolant to facilitate removal of heat from the compressed air. In another embodiment, the heat exchanger 30 is an air-to-air heat exchanger, which utilizes ambient air to facilitate removal of heat from compressed air. In yet another embodiment, the heat exchanger 30 utilizes a combination of a coolant and ambient air to facilitate removal of heat from compressed air.",
        "The power unit 10 also includes a controller 32. In one embodiment, the controller 32 is an electronic logic controller that is programmable by a user. In another embodiment, the controller 32 is an electronic fuel injection controller for the engine 14. The controller 32 receives a crank angle signal 34 from a crank angle sensor 36 provided to detect crank angle (in degrees) of a crank shaft (not shown) of the engine 14. The controller 32 may be operable to produce a pressure signal 38 to control operation of a plurality of fuel injection pumps 40. The pumps 40 drive a plurality of fuel injectors 42 for injecting fuel into the plurality of cylinders 24 of the engine 14. In the illustrated embodiment, the fuel injector 42 is an electrically actuated fuel injector. The fuel injector 42 typically injects fuel into the engine cylinder 24 as a function of a fuel injection signal 39 received from the controller 32. The fuel injection signal 39 may include waveforms that are indicative of a desired injection rate, desired fuel injection timing, quantity of fuel to be injected into the cylinder 24, or the like. A piston 44 is slidably disposed in each cylinder 24 and reciprocates between a top dead center and a bottom dead center position as known to those skilled in the art. The controller 32 also receives a speed signal 46 from a speed sensor 48 configured to detect speed (in revolutions per minute of the crank shaft) of the engine 14. The controller 32 is configured to produce the fuel injection signal 39 to control the operation of plurality of fuel injectors 42 based on the crank angle signal 34 and the engine speed signal 46.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2, the controller 32 having engine exhaust emission and specific fuel consumption control logic 11 is illustrated in accordance with embodiments of the present technique.

For example, pilot fuel injection quantity in the range of 1 to 5% of total fuel injection quantity may be injected into the engine cylinder before the top dead center of the compression stroke. The split fuel injection quantity and proportion control logic 62 also enables the controller 32 to inject a second quantity of fuel (e.g., majority/main fuel injection) 66 into the engine cylinder when the piston is in the vicinity of the top dead center position of the compression stroke.

As discussed above in the illustrated embodiment, the controller 32 is configured to control the fuel injection quantity, timing, pressure and pulse duration based on the output from the plurality of sensors. Although in the illustrated embodiment, the controller operation is explained in relation to one engine cylinder 24, in other embodiments the controller operation is applicable to multiple engine cylinders 24.",
        "Referring to FIG. 3, the locomotive power unit 10 having a multi-cylinder arrangement of the engine 14 is illustrated in accordance with certain embodiments of the present technique. The fuel injectors each include a fuel injection valve 80 disposed in fluid communication with a respective cylinder 24. In the illustrated embodiment, the engine 14 includes four cylinders 24 and four fuel injection valves 80, respectively. However, other numbers (e.g., 6, 8, 10, 12, etc.) and configurations of cylinders 24 and fuel injection valves 80 are within the scope of the present technique. The fuel injection valves 80 are provided to inject fuel into a combustion chamber of each cylinder 24. The fuel injection valves 80 are coupled to a high pressure common rail 82 configured to pressurize the fuel to a preselected pressure.

In accordance with the embodiments of the present technique, the fuel injection operation is applicable from medium load to full load conditions of the engine.",
        "For a single shot fuel injection, if the fuel injection timing is advanced, the specific fuel consumption is reduced and the exhaust gas emission is increased. In accordance with the present technique, the fuel injection is split into the pilot fuel injection and the main fuel injection with advanced timing before top dead center position of the compression stroke of the engine 14. Atomization of fuel is enhanced due to split injection and may be further promoted by increasing the injection pressure of the fuel. The fuel is uniformly distributed in the combustion chamber and the air utilization within the combustion chamber is enhanced. Smaller quantity of pilot injection facilitates prevention of adherence of fuel to cylinder walls. As a result, the exhaust gas emission is substantially controlled and the specific fuel consumption is reduced.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4, one embodiment of the locomotive power unit 10 is illustrated. As illustrated above, the power unit 10 includes the turbocharger 12 and the diesel engine 14.

The database 94 may be configured to store predefined information about the power unit 10. For example, the database 94 may store information relating to crank angle, engine speed, engine power, intake air temperature, exhaust gas temperature, exhaust gas composition, or the like. The database 94 may also include instruction sets, maps, lookup tables, variables, or the like. Such maps, lookup tables, instruction sets, are operative to correlate characteristics of the pilot injection and the main injection to specified engine operation parameters such as engine speed, crank angle, common rail pressure, desired fuel quantity, or the like. Furthermore, the database 94 may be configured to store actual sensed/detected information from the above-mentioned sensors. The algorithm 96 facilitates the processing of signals from the above-mentioned plurality of sensors.",
        "The data analysis block 98 may include a variety of circuitry types, such as a microprocessor, a programmable logic controller, a logic module, etc. The data analysis block 98 in combination with the algorithm 96 may be used to perform the various computational operations relating to determination of fuel injection rate, number of fuel injections, the fuel injection quantity, timing, pressure and pulse duration, time interval between the pilot injection and the main injection, electrical current of the injector waveform, or a combination thereof. Any of the above mentioned parameters may be selectively and/or dynamically adapted or altered relative to time. The controller 34 is configured to control the engine exhaust emission and the specific fuel consumption by performing the pilot injection at the first predetermined time before the piston reaches the top dead center of the compression stroke and by further performing the advanced main fuel injection at the second predetermined time after the first predetermined time before the piston reaches the top dead center of the compression stroke.",
        "Referring to FIG. 5, this figure is a flow chart illustrating one embodiment of the method of operating the turbocharged system 10 of FIG. 1. In the illustrated embodiment, the crank angle and the engine speed are determined as represented by step 100. The crank angle sensor 36 is provided to detect the crank angle of the engine and the speed sensor 48 is provided to detect the engine speed (e.g., rotations per minute of the crank shaft). The controller 32 determines the first predetermined time for the pilot fuel injection before the piston reaches the top dead center of the compression stroke based on the crank angle and/or the engine speed as represented by step 102. The controller 32 actuates the fuel injection pump 40 to inject the pilot fuel quantity into the engine cylinder 24 as represented by step 104. In certain embodiments, pilot fuel quantity in the range of 1 to 5% is injected when the piston is 20 to 90 degrees before top dead center of the compression stroke. The pilot fuel atomizes and mixes with the entrained air in the cylinder 24. As the piston moves towards the top dead center, the pressure and temperature of the mixture of pilot fuel and air is increased due to compression. When the mixture of pilot fuel and air reaches an ignition temperature (self ignition temperature), the mixture of pilot fuel and air ignites to form combustion products before and during the main injection event.",
        "The controller 32 determines the second predetermined time for the main fuel injection near the vicinity of the top dead center of the compression stroke based on the crank angle and/or the engine speed as represented by step 106. The controller 32 actuates the fuel injection pump 40 to inject the main fuel quantity into the engine cylinder 24 as represented by step 108. In certain embodiments, main fuel quantity in the range of 95 to 99% is injected when the piston is less than 5 degrees before top dead center of the compression stroke. The main fuel atomizes and mixes with the entrained air in the cylinder 24. The main fuel also mixes with the entrained burnt mixture of pilot fuel and air. The entrained burnt mixture of pilot fuel and air act as diluents with high specific heat to reduce the temperature of the main injection event, thereby reducing exhaust gas emission. The splitting of fuel injection into the pilot fuel injection and the advanced main fuel injection improves the fuel consumption while the maintaining the engine exhaust emission within predetermined limits.",
        "Referring to FIG. 6, a graph representing variation of fuel injection velocity (represented by Y-axis) relative to the crank angle (represented by X-axis) and, specifically, the top dead center 110 during compression stroke of the compression-ignition engine 14 is illustrated in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present technique. In the illustrated embodiment, a curve 112 represents pilot fuel injection quantity (e.g. 1%, 3%, and 5%) starting at a first angle 114 prior to top dead center 110 within the engine cylinder 14. The first angle 114 of the pilot fuel injection may be in the range of 20 to 90 degrees before the top dead center 110 during the compression stroke. A curve 116 represents main fuel injection quantity (e.g. 99%, 97%, and 95%) starting at a second angle 118 relative to the top dead center 110. The second angle 118 of the main fuel injection may be in the range of less than 5 degrees before the top dead center 110 during the compression stroke. \u201cDwell\u201d is the time period between the end of the pilot injection and the start of the main injection. In the illustrated example, dwell may be varied in the range of about 10 to 80 degrees before the top dead center 110.",
        "Referring to FIG. 7, a graph representing variation of NOx emission (Y-axis) relative to specific fuel consumption (represented by X-axis) of the compression-ignition engine 14 is illustrated in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present technique. The X-axis represents percentage change in specific fuel consumption relative to a SFC baseline 119. The Y-axis represents percentage change in NOx emission relative to a NOx base line 121. A Curve 120 represents decrease in NOx emission and specific fuel consumption for 3% of pilot fuel injection. The dwell between the pilot injection and the main injection may be varied in the range of 10 to 80 degrees before top dead center. A Curve 122 represents decrease in specific fuel consumption and increase in NOx emission for 3% of pilot fuel injection, dwell of 60 degrees before top dead center, and relatively higher fuel injection rate. A Curve 124 represents reduction in specific fuel consumption and increase in NOx emission for 3% pilot fuel injection, dwell of 60 degrees before top dead center, relatively higher fuel injection rate, and the main fuel injection timing advanced by 2 degrees before the top dead center. As discussed above, the engine exhaust emissions are controlled and the specific fuel consumption is reduced by splitting fuel injection of a predetermined quantity into a pilot fuel injection and an advanced main fuel injection before top dead center position of a compression stroke of the engine 14 based on operating conditions of the engine 14 such as engine speed, crank angle, common rail pressure, or the like. In one example, more than 2% of specific fuel consumption benefit may be obtained while maintaining the NOx emission within predetermined limits.",
        "Referring to FIG. 8, this figure is a flow chart illustrating another embodiment of the method of operating the turbocharged system 10 of FIG. 1. In the illustrated embodiment, the fuel injection system of the engine 14 is actuated based on the crank angle and the engine speed as represented by step 126.

The pilot fuel quantity in the range of 1 to 5% is injected when the piston is 20 to 90 degrees before top dead center of the compression stroke. The pilot fuel atomizes and mixes with the entrained air in the cylinder 24. As the piston moves towards the top dead center, the pressure and temperature of the mixture of pilot fuel and air is increased due to compression. When the mixture of pilot fuel and air reaches the ignition temperature, the mixture of pilot fuel and air ignites to form combustion products before and during the main injection event. The specific fuel consumption is reduced by advancing the main fuel injection in the vicinity of the top dead center of the compression stroke as represented by step 130. The main fuel atomizes and mixes with the entrained air in the cylinder 24. The main fuel also mixes with the entrained burnt mixture of pilot fuel and air. The entrained burnt mixture of pilot fuel and air act as diluents with high specific heat to reduce the temperature of the main injection event, thereby reducing exhaust gas emission. The advancing of the main injection event enables better atomization of the fuel resulting in improved fuel consumption. Hence a combination of smaller quantity of pilot fuel injection and advanced main fuel injection provides reduced fuel consumption while maintaining the exhaust emissions within safe limits.",
