        "Certain devices have components that require a voltage high enough to cause corona discharge, a controlled static discharge. This corona discharge is used to charge or discharge a target member such as a photoreceptor belt in a xerographic copier or printer. This provides the component with sufficient instantaneous current density for proper operation, without exceeding a maximum average current value. In such components, if the required current density is greater than the desired average current, a chopped current at an appropriate duty cycle is required.",
        "Some power supplies employ pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) for this type of use, which produces a high voltage pulse at a fixed duty cycle and varies the voltage to obtain the correct average current value. Other power supplies employ pulse width modulation (PWM) and pulse frequency modulation (PFM) all of which are used high voltage applications. In most cases, these switch-mode power conversion schemes are used to improve efficiency and reduce the size of magnetic devices such as transformers.",
        "Among those devices that have such components are \u201cimage-on-image\u201d xerographic color printers wherein multiple corotrons must be precision charged and controlled to provide desired print quality. FIG. 1 (prior art) is a simplified \u201cimage-on-image\u201d xerographic color printer in which successive primary-color images are accumulated on a photoreceptor belt, and the accumulated superimposed images are in one step directly transferred to an output sheet as a full-color image.",
        "Specifically, the FIG. 1 embodiment includes a belt photoreceptor 10, along which are disposed a series of stations, as is generally familiar in the art of xerography, one set for each primary color to be printed. For instance, to place a cyan color separation image on photoreceptor 10, there is used a charge corotron 12C, an imaging laser 14C, and a development unit 16C. For successive color separations, there are provided equivalent corotron, imaging laser and developer elements 12M, 14M, 16M (for magenta), 12Y, 14Y, 16Y (for yellow), and 12K, 14K, 16K (for black). The successive color separations are built up in a superimposed manner on the surface of photoreceptor 10, and then the combined full-color image is transferred at transfer station 20 to an output sheet. The output sheet is then run through a fuser 30, as is familiar in xerography.",
        "Also shown in FIG. 1 is a set of what can be generally called \u201cmonitors,\u201d such as 50 and 52, which can feed back to a control device 54. The monitors such as 50 and 52 are devices which can make measurements to images created on the photoreceptor 10 (such as monitor 50) or to images which were transferred to an output sheet (such as monitor 52). These monitors can be in the form of optical densitometers, calorimeters, electrostatic voltmeters, etc.",
        "Control of voltage to a component or load may be by way of one or more transformer(s). Transformers are magnetic devices consisting of two or more multiturn coils wound on a common core, the coil connected to the energy source being referred to as the primary coil or winding and the coil in which current is induced by the primary coil being referred to as the secondary coil or winding. As understood by those skilled in the art, the turns ratio of the primary coil to secondary coil determines the transformer's voltage ratio, an increase in turns of the secondary coil with respect to the primary coil resulting in a boost of voltage at the secondary.",
        "In precision applications the accumulated errors contributing to output voltage variability, including variation in primary winding voltage, transformer turns ratio and various losses make it necessary to measure or infer output voltage and compare that to the desired output voltage in a closed-loop voltage control circuit. In the most simple topologies sensing resistors in conjunction with a potentiometer may be used at the primary coil of the transformer to measure and control voltage input into the transformer and from that the secondary, output, voltage. Sense elements attached to the low side of the secondary winding of a transformer may also be employed to measure output current and to detect output faults or current overloads.",
        "Determination of output voltage at the secondary side of the transformer by inference of the measured voltage at the primary side may be designed and adjusted to properly compensate for the first two of three listed error contributors. Such determination may include inaccuracies due to internal resistance (IR) losses in the secondary windings (which typically comprise many, many windings of small diameter coils) as well as the IR losses associated with other external secondary resistances that may be included to protect the HV power source and load in the event of an arc or other fault condition. Correction of all such errors may be made by additional sense windings or the incorporation of divide down resistors on the secondary side, but these measures significantly add to expense and complexity of design. Errors in output voltage sensing may significantly degrade the accuracy of very sensitive devices. For example, \u201cimage-on-image\u201d printing devices require precise control of high voltage sources to achieve outstanding print quality.",
        "It would therefore be useful to permit primary side voltage sensing and regulation without need for secondary side voltage sensing. And to successfully do this, it may necessary to properly compensate for secondary IR loss in the primary side voltage sensing circuitry.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,484,256, commonly assigned, discloses a pulsed high voltage variable duty cycle current generator. A circuit automatically controls the peak current output to a specific level and varies the average current output by varying the output duty cycle. To vary the output duty cycle, the average current at the secondary is sensed to control a modulator which drives two power transistors, each controlling half of the primary winding. When both transistors are on, there is no circuit output.",

The actual voltage regulation and primary side voltage drive portions are not included in either the figure or the text. Also missing are the steps required to correctly adjust the voltage sense and secondary current compensation parts of the HV power supply. However, artisans of ordinary skill will appreciate that the primary side voltage sense circuit is adjusted by applying a known voltage to the primary of an unloaded transformer at the normal operating frequency; measuring the actual secondary voltage with a precision, high impedance AC HV Voltmeter; and adjusting Resistor 120 to achieve an exact analog representative of the secondary voltage at the output of Amplifier 125. This procedure compensates the voltage sense circuit for variation in transformer turns ratio.",
        "The secondary current compensation circuit is adjusted by applying a known voltage to a transformer at the normal operating frequency. This transformer is at first unloaded and the secondary voltage measured as is the voltage at the output of the Difference Stage 105. Next the transformer is loaded with a typical load device along with any series resistance that will be present in the final application (such as a series resistor for arc protection.)",
        "The secondary voltage is again measured, this time downstream of the series resistor, and again the output voltage of Difference Stage 105. Resistor 95 is adjusted such that the output of Difference Stage 105 has dropped in the same proportion as the transformer secondary voltage. For instance, if transformer secondary voltage has dropped 5% from the unloaded to the loaded measurements, then Resistor 95 is adjusted so that the Difference Stage 105 output voltage also drops by 5%. As now adjusted, this stage should cause the voltage feedback signal, used to regulate the output voltage, to reflect the exact secondary voltage including any IR voltage drops within the transformer secondary and any external protection resistors, and this allows the voltage regulation circuit (not shown in the figure or described in the text) to correctly regulate the output voltage under various load conditions. This is the desired behavior of this invention.",
        "While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to particular embodiments, it will be appreciated that variations of the above-disclosed and other features and functions, or alternatives thereof, may be desirably combined into many other different systems or applications. Also, various presently unforeseen or unanticipated alternatives, modifications, variations or improvements therein may be subsequently made by those skilled in the art which are also intended to be encompassed by the following claims."
