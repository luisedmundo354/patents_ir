        "The present invention claims priority under 35 USC 119 based on Japanese patent application No. 2003-355490, filed Oct. 15, 2003.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to vehicles, and to remote control devices therefor. More particularly, the present invention relates to a remote control apparatus for a saddle-type, scooter type vehicle which includes a handlebar lock module having a knob which enables at least a starting operation of an engine. The knob is disposed on a leg shield which covers the front of the legs of a rider seated on a riding seat. The remote control apparatus may also include a handlebar lock cancellation operation, in response to reception of an ID signal from a normal portable transmitter carried by a vehicle user.",
        "2. Description of the Background Art",
        "A number of remote control devices for saddle-type, scooter type vehicles are known. One example of a known remote control apparatus is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-278154. However, conventional remote control apparatus do not provide a mechanism for access to operation of the vehicle, when the remote control is not functioning or is unavailable.",
        "In a conventional remote control apparatus, as found in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-278154, the knob of the handlebar lock module is enabled for operation in response to reception of an ID signal from the normal portable transmitter carried by a vehicle user. In order to cope with situations in which the vehicle user loses the portable transmitter or the transmission is disabled due to an inadequate charge of the power cell of the portable transmitter, for example, there exists a need for a remote control apparatus configured to allow an emergency lock cancellation operation by a mechanical key for emergency unlocking. Also, a need exists for a keyhole of the emergency unlocking key cylinder to be disposed at an inconspicuous place, so as to reduce the risk that the keyhole could be tampered with.",
        "The present invention has been made in view of the circumstances described above, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a remote control apparatus for a scooter type vehicle which allows a user to operate the scooter type vehicle using an emergency unlocking mechanical key, even if a portable transmitter is not available, while configuring the key access to minimize risk of tampering therewith.",
        "In order to attain the object described above, according to a first aspect of the invention, a remote control apparatus for a scooter type vehicle includes a handlebar lock module having a knob which enables at least a starting operation of an engine. The remote control apparatus also includes a handlebar lock cancellation operation in response to reception of an ID signal from a conventional portable transmitter carried by a vehicle user. The knob is disposed on a leg shield which is provided to cover the front of the legs of a rider seated on a riding seat. An article accommodation section is provided on the leg shield on one of the left and right sides of the handlebar lock module such that an accommodation recess formed on the leg shield is covered for opening and closing movement by a lid member hinged to the leg shield. An emergency unlocking key cylinder lock for enabling at least starting of the engine and for handlebar lock cancellation without the necessity for the portable transmitter is disposed in the leg shield such that a keyhole thereof faces an inner side face of the accommodation recess.",
        "According to a second aspect of the invention, the remote control apparatus for a scooter type vehicle is characterized in that, in addition to the configuration of the invention as set forth in the first aspect, the riding seat is formed as a tandem type riding seat. The riding seat includes a front seat mounted for opening and closing movement so as to open an accommodation box disposed below the riding seat, and a rear seat disposed behind the front seat. A link mechanism, provided beneath the riding seat and connected to a seat catcher for changing over the front seat between a catching state wherein the seat catcher catches the front seat in the closed position and a seat catch releasing state wherein the seat catcher permits the opening and closing operation of the front seat, is connected to a seat lock actuator which operates in response to a signal from the conventional portable transmitter. The link mechanism is further connected to the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock.",
        "With the invention as set forth above, even if the vehicle user loses the portable transmitter, or the power cell of the portable transmitter has inadequate charge, the scooter type vehicle can still be driven, if the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock is operated by the emergency unlocking mechanical key. In addition, since the keyhole of the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock is disposed such that it faces the inner side face of the accommodating recess, which is disposed at an inconspicuous place and is normally closed by the lid member, the likelihood of mischief occuring to keyhole of the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock is minimized.",
        "Meanwhile, with the invention as set forth above, since the link mechanism for operating the seat catcher is used both for the first case wherein the portable transmitter is effective and for the second case wherein the emergency unlocking key cylinder lock is used, the number of parts is reduced.",
        "Modes for carrying out the present invention are explained below by reference to an embodiment of the present invention shown in the attached drawings. The above-mentioned object, other objects, characteristics and advantages of the present invention will become apparent form the detailed description of the embodiment of the invention presented below in conjunction with the attached drawings.",
        "FIG. 1 is a left side elevational view of a saddle-type, scooter type vehicle.",
