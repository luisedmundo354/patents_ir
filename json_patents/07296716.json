        "This application is entitled to the benefit of my Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/432,037 filed in the United States Patent and Trademarks Office on Dec. 10, 2002.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "This invention relates to anti-theft devices mounted to the person, and more particularly for a belt mounted ID/credit card anti-theft device.",
        "2. Background of the Invention",
        "With the proliferate use of credit cards, health cards and identification cards there is an increased potential for loss, theft and fraudulent misuse of these cards and the data contained on them. Pockets, wallets and purses do not offer the anti-theft characteristics necessary to protect these valuable objects. Money belts, often used to store such items, are cumbersome and uncomfortable to use. There have been several attempts to develop an anti-theft device to hold these types of items. One example is found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,068,787 entitled \u201cMoney Buckle\u201d issued to Craighead on Jan. 17, 1978. Craighead teaches a storage device that is mounted to a belt and is particularly adapted for paper objects and uses a flap to secure the contents within the storage chamber. Craighead is not adapted for securely storing a plurality of modern credit cards and identification cards. The flap closure and outward positioning of the Craighead device leaves such valuable items stored within it vulnerable to loss and theft. Furthermore, Craighead cannot be easily demounted from the belt to which it is attached.",
        "Given the increasing amount of information of a personal and commercial nature stored on modern cards, there is a continued need for an anti-theft device that can be easily worn by the wearer and provides a high degree of security to the contents stored in the device.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to overcome the deficiencies in known anti-theft devices worn on the person.",
        "Another object of the present invention is to provide a belt mounted anti-theft device for storing a plurality of identification cards and credit cards and the like.",
        "Still another object of the invention is to provide a belt mounted anti-theft device that is able to be comfortably worn by the wearer on a waist belt or bag strap.",
        "Another object of the invention is to provide a belt mounted anti-theft device that can be demounted from a belt without having to undo the belt.",
        "The objects of the present invention are satisfied through the provision of a belt mounted ID/credit card anti-theft device adapted for securely holding at least one card. The anti-theft device comprises a first rectangular body and a second elongate body. The first rectangular body is dimensioned so as to receive and securely hold at least one card in a single chamber. The second elongate body is adapted to securely close the open end of the first rectangular body in a locking engagement and to fasten the first rectangular body to waist belt of the wearer or a strap on a bag or back pack worn by the wearer.",
        "In another embodiment, the rectangular first body is adapted to hold a plurality of cards in two chambers.",
        "Further objects and advantages will become apparent from a consideration of the ensuing description and drawings.",
