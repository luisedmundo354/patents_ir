    "title": "Composition and methods for injection of sealants into air conditioning and refrigeration systems",
    "abstract": "The use of sealants based on organosilanes for refrigeration and air conditioning systems is made possible by control of the rate of introduction and viscosity of the sealant mixture within certain ranges. An appropriate choice of organosilane sealant is made to allow effective sealing of small pinhole size leaks in the air conditioning or refrigeration system. The organosilane is then combined with a miscible lubricant at particular ratios to provide the proper mixture viscosity for injection into the refrigerant system to prevent bearing seizure. Specific orifice sizes are selected for an apparatus to ensure that the composition is injected at the flow rates required to prevent liquid slugging and subsequent compressor shutdown or failure. In addition, effective introduction of the mixture requires certain procedures be performed. Injection procedures are also described that prevent temporary or catastrophic equipment shutdown.",

        "The general field of the invention is the injection of sealant into refrigeration and air conditioning systems by means of suitable selection of sealant, mixtures, equipment and procedures to seal small leaks that develop in the system.",
        "Organosilanes have been marketed successfully as automotive air conditioning (A/C) system sealants for several years. Their use is targeted at small pinhole leaks that develop over time, allowing escape of refrigerant. Leaks lead to loss of efficiency for the a/c system as well as undesirable release of refrigerant gas to the environment. The application of these sealants to hermetically sealed systems used in non-automotive a/c systems and in refrigeration systems has been less widespread. In these applications, sealant injection often leads to compressor shutdown due to bearing seizure. At least one sealant manufacturer recommends the use of a \u201chard-start kit\u201d apparently to overcome this issue.",
        "It is desirable to develop alternative products and methods for the introduction of sealant into air conditioning and refrigeration systems.",
        "In a first aspect the invention provides a method for injecting sealant into an air conditioning or refrigeration system having a compressor, a high pressure side (\u201chigh side\u201d), and a low pressure side (\u201clow-side\u201d). The method includes injecting the sealant in a quantity to provide sufficient lubrication to maintain proper operation of the compressor when the sealant is fully distributed in the system, and injecting the sealant so as to maintain proper operation of the compressor before the sealant is fully distributed in the system.",
        "The sealant may be injected at the high side of the system so as to maintain proper operation of the compressor before the sealant is fully distributed by distributing the sealant starting at the high side. The injected sealant may be injected at a rate of less than 6% per minute of lubricant within the system.",
        "The sealant may be injected at a controlled rate so as to maintain proper operation of the compressor before the sealant is fully distributed in the system.",
        "The sealant may be injected into a non-operating system under vacuum, and other system contents, including refrigerant, are later injected into the system causing distribution of the previously injected sealant. Approximately 60% of total system refrigerant may be injected after the sealant.",
        "The sealant may be injected as a part of a fluid mixture, and the mixture further comprises one or more of lubricant, drying agent, corrosion/rust inhibitor, antiwear agent, fluorescent or phosphorescent dye.",
        "The sealant may be an organosilane. The organosilane may be a monomer capable of forming a solid polymer with itself or other chosen organosilanes in the presence of moisture, and is stable in the absence of moisture, and does not substantially interfere with the normal operation of other contents of the system in selected quantities.",
        "The sealant may be part of a fluid mixture further comprising a lubricant. The lubricant may be an oil, the compressor may have a sump containing oil, and the minimum viscosity of the injected fluid mixture may be \u03b7inj as determined by:\n\nexp(xinj.ln \u03b7inj+xsump.ln \u03b7sump+C)\u2267Fr.\u03b7sump\n\n    \n    \n        where,\n        ln is the natural logarithm and exp is the exponential,\n        xinj, is mole fraction of injected material in final sump mixture,\n        xsump is mole fraction of original sump oil in final sump mixture,\n        \u03b7inj, \u03b7sump are viscosities of the injected material and original sump oil respectively, and\n        Fr is a desired fraction of original sump oil viscosity to be maintained.",

        "In a second aspect the invention provides a method of introducing sealant into an air conditioning or refrigeration system having a compressor and evaporator. The method includes connecting a vessel containing a sealant mixture comprising an organosilane between the compressor and the evaporator, and while the system is running, allowing the sealant mixture to enter the system at a rate to prevent liquid slugging and to maintain sufficient concentrations of lubricant for proper operation of the compressor during the injection process, allowing the sealant to enter the system in an amount to maintain sufficient compressor lubricant viscosity for continued proper operation of the compressor, and allowing the sealant to enter in an amount that will allow continued proper operation of the air conditioning or refrigeration system.",
        "In either aspect the sealant may be one or more of an organosilane and a polymeric latex consisting of one or more of a vinyl acetate, methacrylate, nitrile, epoxide and styrene polymer. The mixture may also include one or more of an accelerant and a catalyst.",
        "The sealant mixture may be allowed to enter the system by pressurizing the sealant mixture sufficiently above system low side operating pressure to cause the sealant mixture to enter the system from the vessel when the system is running. Pressurizing the sealant mixture may include using the system pressure of the system in a non-running state to pressurize the sealant mixture in the vessel.",
        "The method may also include allowing the sealant mixture to cool to near ambient temperature after the vessel is pressurized and while the vessel is fluidly connected to the system in the non-running state. The method may also include fluidly disconnecting the pressurized vessel from the system after cooling, running the system until low side pressure drops, and fluidly connecting the vessel to the low side of the system and allowing the sealant to enter the system as provided above.",
        "In a third aspect the invention provides a method of introducing sealant into an air conditioning or refrigeration system having a compressor and an evaporator.

The organosilane is a monomer capable of forming a solid polymer with itself or other chosen organosilanes in the presence of moisture, and is stable in the absence of moisture in the system, and does not substantially interfere with the normal operation of contents of the system in selected quantities.",
        "The step of connecting the vessel may include providing fluid connection between the vessel and the system, and the method may further include allowing sufficient time for the sealant mixture to achieve ambient temperature before running the system after fluid connection.",
        "The method may further include turning off the system when a selected amount of sealant mixture has entered the system for a period of time to allow system pressure to equalize, and repeatedly allowing the sealant mixture to enter the system as specified above and turning off the system to allow pressure to equalize as set out above, until a total selected amount of sealant has entered the system. The method may include equilibrating the system after injecting the approximately 60% of the refrigerant then turning on the system and adding remaining refrigerant.",
        "The sealant mixture may have a viscosity above 7 cst. when measured at 40\u00b0 C. The flow rate of injection may be 6 cc/sec or less.",

        "Fr may be equal to 0.9 or more. Where the calculated viscosity may be less than 7 cst., then the minimum viscosity may be set at 7 cst.",
        "The step of allowing the sealant to enter the system may further include allowing the sealant to enter through an orifice having an opening within a range of from 0.020-0.06 inches diameter.",
        "The step of connecting the vessel to the system may include connecting a hose assembly between the vessel and a low pressure side service port of the system. The hose assembly may include a first fitting for connection to the vessel and a second fitting for connection to the port.",

        "The preferred embodiment of these and other aspects of the invention will be described later herein.",
        "For a better understanding of the present invention and to show more clearly how it may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings which show the preferred embodiment of the present invention and in which:",
        "FIG. 1 is a graphic representation of a sealant injection assembly in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention in use with an air conditioning or refrigeration system 1.",
        "FIG. 2 is a partially exploded perspective view of the assembly of FIG. 1.",
        "FIG. 3 is an end view of a fitting and orifice used in the assembly of FIG. 2.",
        "FIG. 4 is a cutaway view of a typical single cylinder hermetic compressor.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1, a typical hermetically sealed air conditioning or refrigeration system 1 has an evaporator 3, compressor 5, condenser 7 and expansion device 9. The system 1 has a \u201clow side\u201d 10 consisting of the part of the system 1 between the expansion device 9 (for example, an orifice 9) and the suction line to the compressor 5. The compressor 5 draws in low pressure, low temperature refrigerant in a gaseous state from the \u201clow side\u201d 10. The compressor 5 compresses the gaseous refrigerant to a high pressure, high temperature gaseous state that flows to the condenser 7. The refrigerant passes through the condenser 7 and is cooled to a liquid state. The liquid refrigerant passes through the expansion valve 9, which causes the refrigerant to expand to a low pressure, low pressure temperature gas. The evaporator 3 absorbs heat from outside the system 1, and relatively low temperature, low pressure gas is reintroduced to the compressor 5.",
        "For the test environment, the low side pressure is 77 psig at the compressor 5, and pressure on the high pressure side of the compressor (the discharge 11) is 256 psig. The temperature at the evaporator 3 is 45\u00b0 F. and at the condenser 126\u00b0 F. The ambient temperature is 90\u00b0 F. The temperature of the gas between the valve 9 and evaporator 3 is 55\u00b0 F. The temperature at the compressor 5 discharge 11 is 171\u00b0 F. The valve 9 in the test environment had a diameter of 0.059 inches. The gas flow rate in the low side between the evaporator 3 and the compressor 5 is 1596 ft/min. The diameter of pipe in the low side is nominal \u00be inch, while the inside diameter of pipe at the discharge is \u215c inches. This is for a single phase 2 ton compressor 5.",
        "These are typical characteristics for an air conditioning system 1 or the environment about an air conditioning system 1. For larger and smaller systems 1, the particular specifications may change. This a design choice. The particular parameters under which sealant is introduced into the system may vary accordingly.",
        "In order to seal small leaks in the system 1 it is desirable to introduce organosilanes or other sealants into the system 1. Organosilanes cure when in the presence of moisture, such as would occur at the situs of a leak.",
        "The use of organosilanes in non-hermetically sealed air conditioning or refrigeration systems 1 is previously known, see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,237,172 issued 2 Dec. 1980 to Packo et al under title Sealing Leaks by Polymerization of Volatilized Aminosilane Monomers; U.S. Pat. No. 4,304,805 issued 8 Dec. 1981 to Packo et al under title Sealing Leaks by Polymerization of Volatilized Aminosilane Monomers; U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,722 issued 25 May 1982 to Packo et al under title Sealing Leaks by Polymerization of Volatilized Organosilane Monomers; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,417,873 issued 23 May 1995 to Packo under title Sealant Containing Partially Hydrolized Tetraalkoxy Silane, for Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Circuits that describe mixtures for this purpose. As previously mentioned, the simple injection of an organosilane or mixture of organosilanes into a hermetically sealed system 1 will typically cause compressor 5 failure.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2, an injection assembly 12 has a vessel 15 containing an organosilane mixture. In the preferred embodiment the vessel 15 is a canister 15. The mixture is selected for miscibility with the contents of the system 1. It is to be recognized that, in addition to refrigerant, the system 1 contains a miscible lubricant for lubrication of the compressor 5. The system 1 may also have other contents, such as a fluorescent dye for leak detection. It may also contain a chemical dryer to remove moisture from the system 1.",
        "The inventors have recognized that, in addition to liquid slugging, the introduction of greater concentrations of organosilanes remove lubricants from the compressor 5, resulting in compressor 5 failure. The organosilane should be introduced in sufficiently low concentrations and be miscible with the system 1 lubricant to avoid liquid slugging and to maintain sufficient lubricant for proper operation of the compressor 5. The organosilane is introduced from vessel 15 to a low side port 17 between the evaporator 3 and compressor 5.",
        "The organosilane is introduced at a rate that allows the concentration of the organosilane to be diluted sufficiently by the other system 1 contents to prevent liquid slugging and to maintain sufficient concentration of lubricant for proper operation of the compressor 5.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4, controlled injection of the organosilane combined with the miscible lubricant is critical when injected at the low side port 17 because of the close proximity between the low-side charging port 17 and compressor 5. After the organosilane/miscible lubricant mixture enters the compressor 5 along with cool refrigerant vapor it has to first pass by outboard shaft bearing 18. This aids in replacing oil to the outboard bearing which may have been stripped by passing refrigerant. The mixture continues on flow path 19a rushing over motor windings (stator 19b, rotor 19c) removing heat from the electric motor. The flow of refrigerant vapor/mixture is then drawn over oil reservoir (sump) 19d into compressor pump 19e where it is compressed into a hot vapor and discharged. During this flow path the importance of maintaining a suitable viscosity is important for a continued oil barrier between metal internals.",
        "Many refrigeration and air conditioning systems use semi-hermetic or open seal (external drive) compressors and the type of compressor may be reciprocating (piston-cylinder), rotary, scroll, screw or centrifugal. While compressor geometry is critical to the hermetic systems as explained above, general engineering considerations also require control of flow rate, quantity and viscosity of the injected material for the other drives to ensure continued good operation and acceptable compressor life.",
        "The organosilane can be introduced by many different methods. For example, it can be injected at a very slow rate while the compressor 5 is running continuously. This requires fine control over the injection rate. In order to allow increased rate of introduction, the organosilanes (or a portion thereof) can be injected into a running system 1, followed by a period of time during which the system 1 is stopped. The initial use of a running system 1 allows the organosilane to be distributed through the system 1. Stopping the system 1 allows the distributed organosilanes to further mix with the system 1 contents, without forcing areas of high organosilane concentration to flow through the compressor 5 repeatedly. This process can be repeated until all of the organosilane is introduced. Although this may allow for greater rates of introduction, the process would still be slow, and fine control is still required.",
        "An alternative method of introducing the organosilane is to form an organosilane mixture by pre-diluting the organosilane in a material miscible with the system 1 contents and with the organosilane. This mixture is then introduced into the system 1 using one of the methods discussed above.",
        "In the preferred embodiment, the organosilane is mixed with a lubricant to form the organosilane mixture. This has an additional benefit of maintaining lubricant in close proximity to the organosilane at all times. For increased flow control the viscosity of the organosilane mixture can be maintained within a selected range. Organosilane on its own has a very low viscosity (for example <1 cst. at 40\u00b0 C.). This in part results in difficulty in controlling the flow of organosilane.",
        "An additional method of injection would include the use of a fluid injector that can inject the mixture into the working low side system of the unit in small increments, an example include a Revolver\u2122 sold by Cliplight Manufacturing Company of Toronto, Canada. The Cliplight device allows for approximately 0.04 of an ounce to be measured in at any one time. Additional amounts of the mixture depending on the system size could be accurately added. This would be an acceptable method of injection allowing only small amounts of the mixture into the suction gas path and thus preventing possible liquid slugging to the compressor 5.",
        "Also, there are other modifications that could be made to an injection device. For example, a filter 16A could be added, as shown in FIG. 1, to the hose apparatus 16 to filter out any particles injected from the system 1 when charging the canister 15.",
        "Further details of the preferred embodiment will be described.",
        "Referring to the FIGS., the use of sealants based on organosilanes for refrigeration and air conditioning systems 1 is made possible by control of the rate of introduction and viscosity of the sealant mixture within certain ranges. An appropriate choice of organosilane sealant is made to allow effective sealing of small pinhole size leaks in the air conditioning or refrigeration system 1.",
        "Preferably, the organosilane is chosen with several criteria in mind. The organosilane is miscible in the lubricant fluid; it is typically a monomer, but may contain oligomers, capable of forming a solid polymer with itself or other chosen organosilanes in the presence of moisture under the conditions of the particular application. The reaction rate of the organosilane or mixture of organosilanes is sufficient to form an effective seal at the situs of the leak. The polymeric seal is chosen to be sufficiently strong to maintain an effective barrier to prevent further leakage of refrigerant from the system 1. Also, the organosilanes are chosen to be stable in the absence of moisture, be non-corrosive and otherwise inactive to the components of system 1 and be generally environmentally acceptable. Further, the nature and injected quantity of the organosilanes is chosen, to the extent that it would interefere with the refrigerant and/or lubricant, so that such interference remains consistent with the normal operation of the refrigerant fluid e.g. vaporization and liquefaction characteristics.",
        "The organosilane is combined with a miscible lubricant at particular ratios to provide the proper mixture viscosity for injection to the refrigerant system 1 to prevent bearing seizure. Specific orifice 20 (see FIG. 3) sizes are selected for an apparatus to ensure that the mixture is injected at flow rates required to prevent liquid slugging and subsequent compressor 5 shutdown or failure. In addition, certain procedures are performed for effective introduction of the mixture. Injection procedures are also described that reduce risk of temporary or catastrophic equipment shutdown. These include allowing the sealant mixture to cool to ambient temperatures before injection. Cooling permits better control over the flow rate of the organosilane component of the mixture.",
        "Preferred components and compositions for the organosilane include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,237,172 issued 2 Dec. 1980 to Packo et al under title Sealing Leaks by Polmerization of Volatilized Aminosilane Monomers; U.S. Pat.

        "Particular compositions for the organosilane are dependent on the selected criteria from those set out above. However the general nature of the organosilane can be represented as (R1)(R2)Si(R3)(R4) where the preferred nature of the radicals is that\n\n    R1 is an alkyl radical of 1-4 carbon atoms or vinyl or \u2014OH\n    R2 is R1 or \u2014OR1 or \u2014NH(R1) or \u2014N(R1)2 or \u2014R1NHR1NH2 \n    R3 is R1 or \u2014OR1 or \u2014NH(R1) or \u2014N(R1)2 or \u2014R1NHR1NH2, and\n    R4 is R1 or \u2014OR1 or \u2014NH(R1) or \u2014N(R1)2 or \u2014R1NHR1NH2",

        "These compositions are illustrative only as indicated by the patents cited for Packo et al. It is also recognized that not all silanes or combinations will meet each or all of the criteria set out of above.",
        "The lubricant is preferably chosen to be miscible with the organosilane mixture at ambient temperatures to provide proper control of the flow. Preferred lubricants would include those based on fluids such as polyolesters. Lubricants based on other fluids might be used. Those known to be miscible with organosilanes include, for example, mineral oils, alkyl benzenes and polyalkylene glycols.",
        "Other fluids as alternatives to the lubricant or in combination with the lubricant may also be used provided that they result in an appropriate viscosity for the mixture and are compatible with contents of the system 1. In those other systems where the refrigerant is not a carrier for the lubricant, i.e. systems with separate refrigerant and lubrication circuits, these other fluids may also be added. The restrictions outlined elsewhere herein for high-side injection to a 6 vol % max per minute based on oil capacity also apply. These other fluids include, for example, drying agents, elastomer and metal conditioners, antioxidants, corrosion and rust inhibitors, antiwear agents, metal deactivators, acid and base neutralizers, detergents, fluorescent and phosphorescent dyes and such. Drying agents include, for example, mono- and polyhydric alcohols, including glycols, preferentially mono-, di- and trihydric alcohols, organosilanes, or so-called orthoformates.

        "Other sealants, alternative to or in combination with organosilanes, may also be used. These sealants may consist of polymeric latexes, vinyl acetates, acrylonitriles, epoxide or methacrylates or some combination thereof. The sealant may include alkylene glycol. The sealant may contain a catalyst or accelerator. The catalyst may contain a copper or cobalt compound. The catalyst or accelerator may contain a solubilizer. The sealant may contain a filler. The filler may be graphite, carbon powder or a polytetrafluoroethylene.",
        "Preferred compositions of the lubricant/organosilane mixture are those providing viscosities above a viscosity of 7 cst. when measured at 40\u00b0 C. The choice of this viscosity minimum was determined by experiment as illustrated below in examples 4 to 7. The 40\u00b0 C. measurement point is used simply because this is the temperature at which compressor lubricants are typically characterized for viscosity.",
        "The quantity of organosilane to be added depends on the size of the refrigeration or air conditioning system. This is not due to the size or number leaks in the system. For small leaks, say less than 1/16 \u2033 in diameter, and a sealant plug 1/16\u2033 long, several hundred seals would easily require only an ounce of organosilane. The rapidity with which a leak will seal depends on delivering an effective quantity of the sealant to the situs of the leak. This latter consideration, experience in automotive applications, and general practical considerations such as the size of the injection apparatus, suggest that injections of between \u215b and 1 oz. of organosilanes are sufficient for most applications, with larger systems requiring the larger amount. In addition, it has been found that injections up to a maximum of 10% of the lubricant quantity in the system are recommended due to concerns with injection of liquid into the low side in proximity to the compressor.",
        "In the preferred embodiment, organosilane is combined with a miscible lubricant. The quantity of lubricant mixed with the organosilane is determined by considerations of first, providing adequate lubrication as the fluid enters the compressor as has been previously described and second, of producing limited effect on the final lubricant viscosity, preferably no more than 10% reduction, once the organosilane has been distributed throughout the system.",
        "The desired viscosity of the lubricant/organosilane mixture can be achieved by varying the ratio of the two or by adjusting the viscosity of the lubricant. Organosilanes of interest generally have very low viscosities (<1 cst. @ 40 C) while lubricants of interest are much higher in viscosity.",
        "(10 to 220 cst. or more @ 40 C). The effect of the injected mixture on the final lubricant mixture depends on the injected viscosity as well as both the viscosity and quantity of oil in the system.

This process guides selection of the preferred viscosity and quantity of the injected mixture. The following serves to illustrate the process only.",
        "The viscosity of a binary mixture of similar materials is often related to the viscosity of the components by the relation:\n\nln \u03b7mix=x1.ln \u03b71+x2.ln \u03b72+C\u2003\u2003(Equation 1)\n\nwhere: ln is the natural logarithm\n\n    \n    \n        \u03b7mix is the viscosity of the mixture\n        \u03b71, \u03b72 are the viscosities of components 1 and 2 and\n        x1 and x2 are the corresponding mole fractions\n        C is a constant dependent on the nature of the components.",

        "With the limit that the final sump viscosity should not be lowered more than 10% compared to the original sump viscosity, then based on Equation 2, this amounts to a requirement that:\n\nexp(xinj.ln \u03b7inj+xsump.ln \u03b7sump+C)\u22670.9 \u03b7sump\u2003\u2003(Equation 3)\n\nSince the mole fraction of any component depends on the weight percent present for that component, then Equation 3 provides a basis for determining the desired viscosity and quantity limits on the injected material.",

        "As seen in row 1 of Table 3, the injection of 1 oz. of these particular organosilanes causes a drop in viscosity in a 10 oz. sump from 32 to below 19 cst. (all viscosities will refer to 40 C). A maximum drop in sump viscosity of about 10% is generally acceptable, corresponding to 29 cst. limit for units designed for 32 cst. viscosity oils. In such small systems, our testing indicates that this low viscosity material would cause bearing seizure. Rows 2 and 3 of Table 3 show that injection of organosilane blends with a 32 viscosity lubricant can provide satisfactory results. In row 2, it is indicated that 1 ounce of a mixture containing about \u00bc ounce of an organosilane mixture and \u00be ounce of a POE lubricant having a viscosity of 32 cst. at 40 C combine to form a mixed viscosity of 10 cst. When this is injected into a system containing 10 ounces of a lubricant having a viscosity of 10 cst. at 40 C, the resultant sump viscosity of the mixture is expected to be just below 10 cst., at about 9.9 cst. at 40 C. This result is due to the effect of the molar fraction term in equation 1. Line 3 similarly shows that injecting \u215b of an ounce of organosilane in 1 ounce of the lubricant/organosilane mix into such a system using a 32 cst. lubricant rather than a 10 cst. would produce a sump viscosity of 29.9 cst. This is above the suggested 29 cst. limit for this lubricant and would be an acceptable formulation. Rows 4 and 5 show information for systems using a 32 cst. lubricant and having a sump capacity of 30 ounces. Up to about \u2155 of an ounce of organosilane can be injected while still maintaining an injected viscosity of at least 7 cst. Rows 8, 9, and 10 indicate the diminishing effect of larger sump size with various injections compared to the previous rows, allowing up to \u2157 of an ounce of organosilane to be injected while still maintaining final viscosity above 29 cst. Rows 11 and 12 give information for systems using 46 or 68 cst. lubricants in the sump.",
        "An example of the use of this computational technique is the determination of the best combination of lubricant and organosilane to be injected by consideration of the system characteristics exhibited in Table 2. For example if a small unit with a 10 oz. sump contains 32 cst. lubricant, what should be the composition of the injected material using a 32 cst. lubricant and an organosilane mix? With 1 ounce injected, the maximum amount of organosilanes used here is calculated to be 0.175 of an ounce with the injected mixture having a viscosity of 12 cst. and the system lubricant having a final viscosity of 29 cst. At the minimum injected viscosity of 7 cst., then 0.6 ounces of a mixture containing 28.7% organosilanes could be added to the 29 cst. final viscosity, representing 0.172 ounces which is slightly lower.",
        "Table 4 gives examples of situations where the viscosity limit of lubricant (32 cst)/organosilane mix needs to be controlled above the minimum viscosity requirement of 7 cst. dependent on the total amount injected. For example, to maintain a 10 oz. system containing 32 cst. lubricant above 29 cst. after addition of 1 oz. of mixture, then the lubricant/organosilane mixture should be at a minimum viscosity of 12 cst. at 40 C which correspond to less than 0.175 oz. of organosilane in the 1 oz. of material injected. In the case of injecting 3 ounces of this lubricant/organosilane mix into a system containing 30 oz. of 32 cst. lubricant, then a similar minimum viscosity holds. The minimum viscosity for a larger system with 65 oz. of 46 cst. oil is limited to a maximum of 0.81 oz organosilanes when the total charge is 3 oz. in order to keep final viscosity above 41.4 cst. With the 65 oz. sump size, a unit using 68 cst. oil would be limited to a minimum viscosity injected of 17 cst. corresponding to just over \u00bd oz of silane in a 3 oz. total charge to maintain final viscosity above 61.2 cst. Dropping the injected charge to 2 oz. actually yields little benefit in organosilane injected in this case and also has a much lower injected viscosity for the injected material at the minimum injected viscosity.",

        "The application of Equations 1-4 allows calculation of the most desirable mixture of lubricant and organosilane to be used for any specific situation in terms of the size of the unit (oil capacity) and viscosity of the sump oil. The minimum ratio of lubricant to organosilane is predetermined by the minimum allowable injected viscosity and the individual viscosities of the lubricant and organosilane in the injected mixture. The viscosity of mixtures relate exponentially to component viscosities and in ratios dependent on mole fractions rather than simple weight fractions. In addition, it is recognized that the molecular nature of the lubricant affects the relation between viscosity and molecular weight so that the examples presented here are not to be taken as representing the only possible trends.",
        "These examples demonstrate that the application of the techniques described herein is not limited to fluids of a particular viscosity except as related to effective injection and longer term operation of the system particularly as related to the compressor.",
        "Some systems operate with a lubricating subsystem that is independent of the refrigerant. In this case, organosilanes alone are injected into the refrigerant circuit.",
        "It is also possible to inject organosilanes alone in systems where the lubricant is carried by a miscible refrigerant. In this case, the organosilane alone, or in a mix with lubricant, can be injected into the high side of a refrigeration system while the unit is operating up to a maximum of 6% per minute of the systems total oil content. For example, a system with a 50 oz oil capacity could be injected up to a rate of 3 oz/min. of organosilanes. The quantity injected remains limited by the foregoing based on limits to reduction in sump viscosity. After 6% is exceeded, there will be a decreased level of compressor performance due to higher discharge temperature resulting in possible decreased oil return to the low side of compressor eventually damaging the shaft bearings. Injecting at a rate above 8% per minute of the total oil system's content will likely result in loss of effective heat transfer, decreased bearing lubrication and possible catastrophic compressor failure. It is recognized that the 6% and 8% amounts are for typical systems and there are likely systems that can exceed these thresholds while falling within the principles described herein.",
        "The sealant could also be injected into the high side of the unit while it is out of service and in a vacuum state with all refrigerants removed. Once injected into the high side, the system is recharged using refrigerant gas or liquid into the high-side up to at least 60% of the systems full charge. This is carried out while the unit is turned off. The system is then allowed to completely equilize before turning the unit on and topping off the required system's charge.",
        "These methods can be utilized regardless of the class of compressor.",
        "In the preferred embodiment, injection of the lubricant/organosilane mixture is accomplished through the use of a sealed canister 15 and a coupling hose assembly 16 that is first fitted to the canister 15 and then to the inactive refrigeration system 1 through an injection port 17 on the low-pressure side of the compressor 5.",
        "The canister 15 can be pressurized before the canister 15 is sealed. The pressure in the canister 15 causes the sealant mixture to enter the system 1 when the canister is opened, there is fluid connection to the system 1, and the system 1 is running to cause \u201clow side\u201d 10 pressures to drop. In test environment the canister 15 was not pre-pressurized as will be explained below; however, a charged pressure of 100 psig was found to be acceptable for allowing the sealant mixture to enter the system 1 in the test environment, where the low side pressure was 77 psig as mentioned previously.",
        "Alternatively, the sealed canister 15 can have a pressure near, at or below ambient. The canister 15 can be charged (pressurized) using the system 1 pressure. First the system 1 is turned off and pressure within the system 1 is allowed to equalize. In the test environment, this results in an overall system 1 pressure of approximately 100 psig. The canister 15 is then placed in fluid connection with the system 1. This causes the canister 15 to be pressurized to approximately 100 psig. The system 1 can then be run. This causes the pressure in the low side 10 to drop. The higher pressure within the canister 15 causes the sealant mixture to enter the system 1.",
        "Using a non-pressurized canister 15 as described above is preferred as such containers are less hazardous. This means, for example, that they are transportable without having to comply with the strict transportation regulations applicable to pressurized containers.",
        "More details of a preferred method used in the test environment will now be described. Before use, the canister 15 is at a pressure of about 20 inches of mercury vacuum. The vacuum is a result of packaging processes that ensure much of the air is removed from the canister 15 before it is sealed. Hose assembly 16 is evacuated and then the canister 15 seal is broken using a can-tapper 21 that is built into the hose assembly 16 in such a way that refrigerant mix from the system 1 is allowed into the canister 15 until pressures are stabilized, and the canister 15 is charged. The can-tapper 21 has a manually operated valve (see valve handle 25 below) for fluid connection (open) and fluid disconnection (closed) of the canister 15 from the system 1. It also has a tapping pin (operation described below) for unsealing the canister 15 (which is also required for fluid connection when the canister 15 is sealed). The can-tapper 21 is also a fitting for sealed fluid connection to the canister 15, typically by way of compatible threads in the can-tapper and on the canister 15, and corresponding seals, such as a rubber gasket or an o-ring.",
        "The addition of canister 15 contents to the refrigerant system 1 is controlled to a maximum flow rate of about 6 cc/sec which in the preferred embodiment is obtained through the use of orifice 20 having a maximum diameter of about 0.06 in. One such arrangement is shown in FIG. 2. Although there is no minimum flow rate required, the minimum orifice size should be about 0.02 inches in diameter to avoid orifice plugging due to contamination from particles from system 1 as the canister 15 is charged. This minimum restriction could be removed by the inclusion of a filter, such as filter 16A of FIG. 1, in the injection hose between the fitting 22 and the injection port 17.",
        "The orifice 20 is located within fitting 22 of FIG. 2. In the test environment an orifice of 0.0292 inches diameter was successful. The hose assembly 16 has a hose 23 between the can-tapper 21 and the fitting 22.",
        "Surprisingly, it has been found that the action of filling the canister 15 with refrigerant upon tapping the canister 15 and opening a valve in the tapper 21 causes the canister 15 and its contents to heat to temperatures well above ambient. Temperatures of 135\u00b0 F. were encountered in tests. This may affect the flow rate of the organosilane as it enters the system 1. In the preferred embodiment, the canister 15 is fluidly disconnected after charging and the system 1 is run. Then the canister 15 is again fluidly connected to the system 1. This allows the system 1 to achieve full low side 10 pressure that will best allow the sealant mixture to enter the system 1.",
        "As there is a period of time between disconnecting and re-connecting the canister 15, the canister 15 should be allowed to cool to at or near ambient temperature while still fluidly connected to the non-running system 1. If not, then charge in the canister 15 may be lost as pressure will drop with the temperature in a closed canister 15.",
        "Also, the contents of the canister 15 should enter the cooler suction gas stream with as close to ambient temperature of the system 1 as possible so as not to effect the volume of the cooler gas going to the compressor 5. A compressor 5 generally requires at least a four percent return of oil to maintain adequate lubrication on metal-to-metal surfaces. In practical terms, a residential system 1 operating at a suction pressure of 70 psig will typically have a corresponding evaporator 3 saturation temperature of 41 degrees F. If the system 1 is operating satisfactorily then the actual suction line 10 temperature should be approximately 51 degrees F. This is due to an extra 10 degrees of superheat picked up during the expansion. Elevating this temperature momentarily could cause an erratic expansion of gas followed by contraction resulting in a cavitation effect on the compressor 5. Experiments show a fluctuation in low-side and high-side pressures when the product has not been sufficiently cooled. Rapid changes of pressure can damage compressor valves and discharge excess oil from the compressor sump into the high-side line. This excess oil will begin to log and affect downstream conditions such as temporary high discharge pressures accompanied by temporary low-side pressure. The percentage of required oil to be carried back could lower to the point of not supplying adequate lubrication to metal-to-metal contact causing damage to the compressor 5.",

Having the gas first pass through\n\n\nthe mixture also helps to mix the contents of the mixture if possible\n\n\nstratification occurred between the organosilane and the miscible lubricant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u20029.\nTurn handle 25 clockwise until it stops, isolating charged canister 15\n\n\n\nfrom A/C or R system 1.\n\n\n10.\nWhile holding the canister 15 upside down turn on A/C system 1.\n\n\n\nSlowly turn handle 25 counter-clockwise gradually releasing sealant\n\n\n\ninto the system 1. This should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReleasing sealant too quickly could result in liquid slugging. Shake\n\n\ncanister 15 gently to determine when empty. If all of the contents in\n\n\ncanister 15 are not emptied after 5 minutes then turn canister 15 tapper 21\n\n\npiercing handle 25 clockwise until it stops. Turn of A/C or R system 1\n\n\nand repeat steps 8, 9 and 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.\nOnce canister 15 is empty remove female fitting 22 from low side\n\n\n\nservice port 17, then shut down A/C system 1. Allow system 1\n\n\n\npressure to equalize. The A/C or R system 1 should be left off for\n\n\n\napprox. 5 minutes. This procedure allows product to mix with\n\n\n\nsystems 1 oil and when the system 1 is restarted will allow for equal\n\n\n\ndistribution throughout system 1.",
        "In typical experiments performed during the course of the current development, a canister was used with approximate dimensions of 5 cm. diameter and 10 cm height and this contained about 89 cc (3 oz.) of a lubricant/organosilane mix. With the canister 15 filled with refrigerant and inverted at ambient conditions, this would produce a lower column of liquid about 4.5 cm. high covered with a gaseous column of refrigerant 5.5 cm. in height. The pressure exerted by the refrigerant was around 120 psi and this was then injected into a system operating at 66 psi. Thus the driving force for injection of the liquid phase into the system was about 54 psi.",
        "In an ideal situation the equation\n\nQ=Cd\u00d7A\u00d7(2\u00d7\u0394P/\u03c1)1/2\u2003\u2003(Equation 5)\n\ncould be applied where\n\n    Q is flow rate\n    Cd is the coefficient of discharge\n    \u0394P is the differential pressure, and\n    \u03c1 is the fluid density.",
        "Experiments in transparent glass vessels showed the expected result that the liquid actually contained bubbles of refrigerant. Nevertheless, considering the ideal one-phase flow situation, equation 5 can be applied to obtain at least a model of the injection process. For an orifice of 0.029 inches in diameter, the canister was found to empty in about 90 sec. This corresponds to a coefficient of discharge of 0.37. Experiments showed that satisfactory injections could be made using orifice sizes up to about 0.060 inches. This corresponds to an initial flow rate of 6 cc/sec and a final flow rate of 4 cc/sec for the last fraction of the liquid.",
        "Considerations of system size relate to the effect on viscosity of the lubricant in the system which tends to increase with the size of the system itself. System size is typically measured in tons\u2014a measure if the cooling capacity of the system 1 (1 ton is equivalent to the delivery of 12,000 BTU cooling capacity per hour). General consideration of these factors provide \u201crules of thumb\u201d to guide quantities of organosilane mixture to be added. For example, one scenario suggests for units above 5 tons capacity, a mixture about 7-8 cst. @ 40 C is appropriate and about 10 cst. for smaller units. The actual total quantity of lubricant/silane mix is dependent on ensuring effective delivery of sealant material to the situs of the leak. Typically, units below 1 ton should require about \u215b-\u00bc oz. of organosilane and larger units \u00bd-1 oz. The total quantities of the mixture will also depend on the practicality of the details of the injection system being used. The viscosity of the mixture and the quantity of organosilane can be adjusted within these general guidelines.",
        "The principles described herein are further illustrated in the following examples, but the scope is not limited by these examples.",
        "The general test apparatus is shown schematically in FIG. 2 and represents the basic components of a typical refrigeration system 1. A refrigerant gas (R-22 was used in the test environment; however, R134a and other refrigerants could also be used) is circulated by means of a hermetically sealed electric motor and compressor 5. The gas is cooled to liquid by means of a condenser 7; the liquid passes through valve and then through an evaporator 3 where the liquid is regenerated to a gas accompanied by the desired cooling effect. The gas then returns to the compressor 5 for repeating cycles of the process.",
        "Sealant and mixtures were added by the procedure represented in Table 1 to the low pressure (suction) side of the compressor 5.",
        "In the base case, simple injection of the organosilane sealant in the low side port 17 was shown not to be appropriate for hermetically sealed refrigerant compressor 5 systems 1.",
        "In a laboratory test, a 2 ton vertical hermetic single phase refrigeration system 1 with a full refrigerant load was loaded to simulate an ambient temperature above 32\u00b0 C. An organosilane mixture was injected into the circuit and the compressor 5 failed after only one further hour of operation due to bearing seizure.",
        "In another set of tests, two 2 ton single phase piston type systems 1 were injected with a mixture of commercial organosilane and immiscible lubricating oil. Failure occurred in one system 1 after 10 minutes and after 1 hour in the second case.",
        "Two small 10,000 BTU packaged refrigerant systems 1 were tested. Both failed within 10 hours. Subsequent examination of these systems 1 showed that failure was due to lack of oil to the upper sleeve bearing, referred to as the compressor 5 outboard bearing.",
        "The effect of sealant viscosity was investigated by varying the ratios of organosilane and lubricating oil in the sealant mixture.",
        "Mixtures of organosilane sealant (viscosity<1 cst@40\u00b0 C.) and immiscible compressor 5 oil (viscosity 68 cst. @ 40\u00b0 C.) caused bearing seizure in all five cases in Examples 1,2, and 3.",
        "Use of straight organosilane mixture caused compressor 5 bearing seizure within one hour in a test with the 2 ton system 1.",
        "A test was performed using a 0.029 in. orifice 20 to inject a 3 fl. oz. mixture consisting of 3 parts of a commercial polyolester refrigeration compressor 5 oil and 1 part of an organosilane sealant such that the mixture had a viscosity of 8 cst. @ 40\u00b0 C. The oil capacity of the single phase hermetically sealed 2 ton system 1 was 55 oz. The system 1 was injected with the organosilane/oil mixture with no change in amperage of the motor, indicating no liquid slugging. The system 1 was run successfully for 12 days until shut down deliberately.",
        "A test was performed similar to that described in Example 6 except that the mixture injected consisted of 2 parts of the commercial polyolester refrigeration compressor 5 oil and 1 part of the organosilane sealant to give a mixture viscosity of 11 cst. @ 40\u00b0 C.",
        "A start/stop test was run with 60 start/stops over a 3\u00bd hr. period. This is a severe test due to the surge of electricity required to start the spinning of the rotor of the motor and also due to some initial loss of oil from the inboard bearing at each start. The test was successful with no change in operating variables and the system 1 ran for an additional 13 days with excellent operation until it was deliberately shut down.",
        "Controlled rate of introduction of the organosilane/oil mix was investigated as a variable. The hose assembly shown in FIG. 2 was used to introduce mixtures into a 2 ton refrigeration system 1 fitted with an oversized 2\u00bd ton condenser 7. The can-tapper 21 at one end of the hose seals and punctures a canister 15 containing the sealant. The fitting 22 at the other end is attached to the refrigeration system 1 and low-side port 17 is opened to allow the sealant mixture to enter the refrigeration system 1 through an orifice 20. The size of this orifice 20 affects the injection rate of the sealant.",
        "Using an orifice 20 size of 0.094 in., it was found that the rate of addition of the sealant/oil mixture caused fluctuations in suction and discharge pressure of the system 1. As previously mentioned this upset condition can cause the compressor to momentarily discharge from the sump into the discharge line causing logging possibly affecting oil return to the suction side of the compressor and eventual bearing failure. Any needle valve associated with the orifice 20 would not allow sufficient additional fine control to overcome this problem.",
        "A capillary tube was used to control introduction of the sealant. An orifice 20 size of 0.055 in. was found to allow successful introduction of the sealant into the above refrigeration system 1. The system 1 ran for 18 days with no change in operating variables before it was deliberately shut down.",
        "Inserting an orifice 20 size of 0.029 in. into the system 1 described in Example 8 was tested and found to give successful injection of organosilane/oil mixes.",
        "Smaller systems are of the greatest concern for susceptibility to the rate and quantity of injection.",
        "The two examples below were injected with a mixture consisting of \u00be oz of polyolester lubricating oil and \u00bc oz of a silane mixture having a total viscosity of 9.8 cst. at 40 C using the injection technique outlined in Table 1. In each case, the sump originally contained 10 oz. of polyalkylene glycol lubricant having a viscosity of 32 cst. at 40 C. Examples 11 and 12 below support an injection limit of up to 10 vol % of sealant mixture, bases on sump oil charge, can be injected into refrigeration or air conditioning systems. In addition, it is apparent in these examples that the refrigerant charges are extremely small (3.70 and 1.69 oz) but that the additional 10 vol % liquid has had no effect on the thermal efficiencies of the units.",

        "As outlined in Table 1, the typical procedure used to inject mixtures into the refrigeration system 1 involves opening the canister 15 containing the oil/organosilane mixture to a low pressure port 17 just prior to the non-operating compressor 5. The mixture is at a pressure near 20 inches of mercury vacuum before opening to the refrigerant system 1 which is typically near 100 psig. The entry of the refrigerant into the mixture in the canister 15 causes a heating effect and raises the canister 15 and contents to about 25\u00b0 C. above ambient. Single phase systems 1 are particularly susceptible to this effect since entry of the hot mixture into the refrigeration system 1 would cause momentary heating of the suction vapor and a decrease in the vapor's density. This in turn affects the ability of the vapor to cool the motor and other mechanical parts.",
        "Therefore as part of the procedure to inject the mixture from the canister 15, it is important to allow the refrigerant/sealant mixture to cool before introduction into the refrigeration system 1.",
