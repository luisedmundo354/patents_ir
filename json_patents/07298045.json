        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a stacked-type semiconductor device in which a plurality of semiconductor elements are stacked and to a fabrication method thereof.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Miniaturized thin stacked-type semiconductor devices in which a plurality of semiconductor elements are stacked, such as semiconductor devices in which a plurality of semiconductor memories are installed, are in demand in keeping with the expansion of the functions of small and lightweight portable information devices and so forth.",
        "First, a first conventional example disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2002-270763 (a semiconductor device in which a semiconductor carrier electrode and an upper semiconductor element electrode are connected by means of a fine metal wire) will be described with reference to FIGS. 23A and 23B.",
        "The semiconductor device disclosed in the first conventional example is such that the surface of a first semiconductor element 53, which has bumps 56 formed on surface electrodes, is oriented downward and the semiconductor element 53 is joined to a semiconductor carrier 51, which is a multilayered circuit wiring substrate. A plurality of first electrodes 62 for conduction with the first semiconductor element 53 and a second plurality of electrodes 52 for conduction with a second semiconductor element 58 are formed on the upper surface of the semiconductor carrier 51. Further, this plurality of first electrodes 62 and the bumps 56 that are formed on the first semiconductor element 53 are joined by means of conductive adhesive 65. This conductive adhesive 65 is supplied to the bumps 56 beforehand. Further, underfill material 54 is made to fill and insulate the gap between the mutually joined first semiconductor element 53 and semiconductor carrier 51. In addition, a second semiconductor element 58 is bonded via die-bonding material 57 to the rear face (the upper face in FIG. 23A) of the first semiconductor element 53 such that the second semiconductor element 58 and first semiconductor element 53 are stacked. Further, wire bonding is used to connect electrically bonding pads 59 on the second semiconductor element 58 and a plurality of second electrodes 52 on the upper face of the semiconductor carrier 51 to one another via fine metal wires 60. In addition, an insulating sealing resin 63 is made to fill and seal the wiring portion of the fine metal wires 60 and the periphery of the first semiconductor element 53 between the second semiconductor element 58 and semiconductor carrier 51. Finally, external terminal electrodes 61 are mounted on the lower face (external face) of the semiconductor carrier 51.",
        "Next, a second conventional example disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2003-347505 (a semiconductor device in which inner leads are adopted in place of the fine metal wires that are used in the first conventional example) will now be described with reference to FIGS. 24A and 24B.",
        "The semiconductor device disclosed in the second conventional example has a first semiconductor element 73, a second semiconductor element 78, and a tape carrier 71 stacked and arranged in the same package. Further, the tape carrier 71 and the semiconductor elements 73 and 78 are electrically connected by means of inner leads 75 of the tape carrier 71. That is, a plurality of lands 72 is formed on an array that is provided on the surface of the tape carrier 71 and external terminal electrodes 81 are mounted on the lands 72. Further, the inner leads 75, which extend from the lands 72, are each bonded to electrode pads 74 of the first semiconductor element 73 and/or to the electrode pads 79 provided on the upper-face perimeter of the second semiconductor element 78. In addition, sealing resin 83 is made to fill from the upper face of the second semiconductor element 68 to the outer perimeter of the tape carrier 71, whereby the inner leads 75 and bonding pads 74 and 79 are protected.",
        "However, the semiconductor device of the first conventional example includes factors that obstruct miniaturization. That is, the semiconductor device uses wire bonding to connect the bonding pads 59 of the second semiconductor element 58 to the second electrodes 52 of the semiconductor carrier 51. In a case where the connections are made by using wiring bonding, as shown in FIG. 23B, a sealing fill region (bonding area) 70, which is filled by means of insulating sealing resin 63, must be provided at least as far as the outside of the second semiconductor element 58 so that the fine metal wires 60 jut out further than the outer edge of the second semiconductor element 58. Hence, the mounting area is larger than that of the second semiconductor element 58, which is an impediment to miniaturization of the semiconductor device.",
        "There has also been a problem that because the first semiconductor element 53 and second semiconductor element 58 are completely sealed with resin, the semiconductor device is caused to be inferior in heat radiation.",
        "In addition, the semiconductor device of the second conventional example above includes factors obstructing an increased number of pins (a greater number of the external terminal electrodes 81). That is, with the semiconductor device, the semiconductor elements 73 and 78, which are arranged stacked in the same package, are electrically connected to the lands 72 by means of the inner leads 75. Hence, the number of lands 72 arranged is limited by the amount of wiring of the inner leads 75. Further, there must be a smaller number of mounting parts of the semiconductor elements 73 and 78 than the semiconductor device. The above factors obstruct any increase in the number of pins of the semiconductor device.",
        "The present invention solves the above problems, and has an object to provide a semiconductor element device that allows advances in miniaturization and possesses superior heat radiation, and a fabrication method for the semiconductor element device.",
        "In the case of the present invention, the second semiconductor element is bonded to the one face of the first semiconductor element on the other face of which a first electrode is provided. The second semiconductor element is formed larger than the first semiconductor element and a second electrode is provided on the outer perimeter of the other face. A third electrode on the one face of a wiring substrate is joined by means of flip-chip bonding to the first electrode of the first semiconductor element. A fourth electrode provided on the outer perimeter of the other face of the wiring substrate and the second electrode of the second semiconductor element are connected via fine metal wire by means of wire bonding. The periphery of the first semiconductor element and the wiring portion of the fine metal wire are sealed by means of insulating sealing resin between the second semiconductor element and the wiring substrate, and a sealing fill region for the sealing resin is formed substantially the same as the external dimensions of the second semiconductor element.",

        "As shown in FIG. 1, the semiconductor device comprises a first semiconductor element 3, a second semiconductor element 8, and a semiconductor carrier 1 constituting a multilayered circuit wiring substrate.",
        "The first semiconductor element 3 has a plurality of bumps 6 constituting protruding electrodes formed on electrodes 6a, which are first electrodes on the other face (referred to as the lower face in FIG. 1 hereinafter). Further, the second semiconductor element 8 is formed with a larger outer diameter dimension than the first semiconductor element 3 and bonding pads 9, which are second electrodes, are formed on the outer perimeter that is outside the outer diameter dimension of the first semiconductor element 3 on the other face. The semiconductor carrier 1 has a plurality of first adhesive layers 2, which are third electrodes, formed on the one face (referred to as the upper face in FIG. 1 hereinafter) in correspondence with the plurality of bumps 6 and has a plurality of second adhesive layers 12, which are fourth electrodes, formed on the outer perimeter of the other face. As the material of the semiconductor carrier 1 used here, materials such as a glass epoxy board, an organic substrate or ceramic substrate can be adopted. A glass epoxy board is used here.",
        "Further, a plurality of external terminal electrodes 11 is formed on the semiconductor carrier 1. The external terminal electrodes 11 allow conduction to a predetermined first adhesive layer 2 on the outer perimeter of the other face. The external dimensions of the semiconductor carrier 1 are formed the same or somewhat larger than the external dimensions of the first semiconductor element 3. Further, because the semiconductor carrier 1 must make an electrical connection with the second semiconductor element 8, a size is adopted for the external dimensions of the semiconductor carrier 1 that is at least one millimeter or more smaller than the external dimensions of the second semiconductor element 8. In addition, the other face of the second semiconductor element 8 is bonded via die-bonding material 7 to the one face of the first semiconductor element 3. Flip-chip bonding is used to bond the bumps 6 of the first semiconductor element 3 to the first adhesive layer 2 of the semiconductor carrier 1 via a conductive adhesive 5 and the semiconductor carrier 1 is stacked on the other face of the first semiconductor element 3. In addition, underfill material 4 is introduced to the gap between the first semiconductor element 3 and semiconductor carrier 1 and to the periphery thereof, whereby the bumps 6 are protected. Furthermore, wire bonding is used to form a connection via fine metal wires 10 with the first adhesive layer 2 that is formed from the bonding pads 9 of the second semiconductor element 8 to the periphery of the other face of the semiconductor carrier 1.",
        "In addition, in order to protect the first semiconductor element 3, the second semiconductor element 8 and the fine metal wires 10, an insulating sealing resin 13 is made to fill and seal the periphery of the semiconductor carrier 1 and the wiring portion of the fine metal wires 10 from the other face of the second semiconductor element 8 to the semiconductor carrier 1. Further, a sealing fill region 20 for the sealing resin 13 is formed over substantially the same area as the external dimensions of the second semiconductor element 8.",
        "First Fabrication Method of the Semiconductor Device.",
        "Next, the first fabrication method of the semiconductor device according to the first embodiment will be described with reference to FIGS. 2A to 2E.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2A, the other face of the first semiconductor element 3 is bonded via the die-bonding material 7 to the one face of the second semiconductor element 8 (step A). An insulating paste, insulating sheet, or the like, can be adopted as this die-bonding material 7 but an insulating sheet is used here.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2B, the bumps 6 are formed on the electrodes 6a of the first semiconductor element 3. Plated bumps or stud bumps for which metal is used can be adopted as the bumps but stud bumps are employed here.",
        "Next, as shown in FIG. 2C, after the conductive adhesive 5 has been supplied to the bumps 6, the semiconductor device is inverted and disposed on the semiconductor carrier 1 so that the second semiconductor element 8 faces upward. The bumps 6 and first adhesive layer 2 are then joined by flip-chip bonding such that the first semiconductor element 3 is stacked on the semiconductor carrier 1 (step B). Underfill material 4 is also introduced to the gap between the first semiconductor element 3 and semiconductor carrier 1 and to the periphery thereof, whereby the bumps 6 are protected (step C).",
        "As shown in FIG. 2D, the semiconductor device is inverted so that the second semiconductor element 8 faces downward. Second adhesive layers 12 are then formed on the periphery of the other face of the semiconductor carrier 1. Wire bonding is then used to connect electrically the bonding pads 9 of the second semiconductor element 8 and the second adhesive layer 12 via fine metal wires 10 (step D).",
        "As shown in FIG. 2E, in order to protect the first semiconductor element 3, the second semiconductor element 8, and the fine metal wires 10, sealing resin 13 is made to fill and seal the periphery of the first semiconductor element 3 and semiconductor carrier 1 from the other face of the second semiconductor element 8 to the semiconductor carrier 1 and the wiring portion of the fine metal wires 10 (step E). Here, a sealing fill region (bonding area) 20, which is filled with the sealing resin 13, is formed over substantially the same area as the external dimensions of the second semiconductor element 8. Next, fabrication of the semiconductor device is completed by attaching external terminal electrodes 11.",
        "Further, as a modified example of the first fabrication method above, the order of fabrication may be such that the second semiconductor element 8 is bonded via die-bonding material 7 to the rear face of the first semiconductor element 3 (step A) after first joining the first semiconductor element 3 to the one face of the semiconductor carrier 1 by means of flip-chip bonding (step B) and introducing underfill material 4 (step C), that is, the order may be step B, step C, step A, step D, and step E.",
        "Here, as shown in FIG. 1, in order to achieve a favorable connection between the external terminal electrodes 11 and the outside, the thickness:t of the sealing resin 13 protecting the fine metal wires 10 and second adhesive layer 12 is formed thinner than the mounting height:h of the external terminal electrodes 11. This is because, when the thickness:t of the sealing resin 13 is greater than the height:h of the external terminal electrodes 11, the thickness:t of the sealing resin 13 is an obstacle when the semiconductor device is mounted, which hinders the connection with the external terminal electrodes 11. For example, the mounting height:h of the external terminal electrodes 11=approximately 250 \u03bcm, the thickness:t of the sealing resin 13=approximately 200 \u03bcm, and the height of the fine metal wires 10 is formed approximately 150 \u03bcm from the other face of the semiconductor carrier 1. Implementation may be such that the thickness and height shown here can be optionally changed in accordance with the height of the external terminal electrodes 11. However, in a general semiconductor device, the difference (h\u2212t) between the mounting height:h of the external terminal electrodes 11 and the thickness:t of the sealing resin 13 must be at least 50 \u03bcm or more.",

Therefore, according to the above first embodiment, because there is no need to arrange the fine metal wires extending to the outside of the semiconductor element by means of wire bonding as per a conventional semiconductor device, in the existing package form, the shortest wire (fine metal wire) length=0.4 mm and the length of the bonding area pad 200 \u03bcmm=0.2 mms, and a region of 1.2 mm [=(0.4+0.2)\u00d72] for each package edge is not necessary.

Supposing that the thickness:t of the sealing resin 13 is 200 \u03bcm, for example, the mounting height:h of the external terminal electrodes 11 must be 250 \u03bcm or more. Hence, when the external terminal electrodes 11 are solder balls, for example, the solder balls must be formed with a size equal to or more than 250 \u03bcm. As a result, limitations on the number of terminals to the outside arise and there is the risk of the problem that the condition cannot be applied to the semiconductor device with multiple pins, and so forth.",

Further, the height:H of the step 21c between the protruding face 21a and the backward face 21b is formed substantially the same as the thickness:t of the sealing resin 13 that covers the fine metal wires 10 and second adhesive layer 12. Because the thickness:t of the sealing resin 13 is taken up by the height H of the step 21c, the surface of the sealing resin 13 and the protruding face 21a can be formed in substantially the same plane and there are no restrictions on the mounting height h of the external terminal electrode 11. Naturally, there is no problem even when the thickness:t of the sealing resin 13<the height:H of the step 21c and, when the thickness:t of the sealing resin 13>the height:H of the step 21c, in cases where this difference is slight, restrictions on the mounting height:h of the external terminal electrodes 11 are minimal.",
        "Therefore, in cases where the external terminal electrodes 11 are solder balls or solder-plated, or similar, the height of the external terminal electrodes 11 can be varied freely. Further, sufficient adaptability is also possible with a LGA (Land Grid Array), in which the external terminal electrodes 11 of the semiconductor carrier 21 are solderless. There are also no restrictions on the number of external terminal electrodes 11 and hence this implementation is applicable to the stacked-type semiconductor device with multiple pins.",

That is, the thickness:t of the sealing resin 13 that covers the second adhesive layer 12 and protrudes from the protruding face 21a is reduced by the height:H from the backward face 21b to the protruding face 21a.

        "As shown in FIG. 20A, electrodes 31 are provided on the one face of the first semiconductor element 3. As shown in FIG. 20B, bumps 33 are formed on the electrodes 31. Plated bumps or stud bumps for which metal is used can be adopted as the bumps 33 but stud bumps are employed here.",
        "As shown in FIG. 20C, a bump pedestal is provided on the electrode face 32 of the second semiconductor element 8. The bump 33 is then supplied with a conductive adhesive 5, the electrode face 31 of the first semiconductor element 3 and the bump pedestal of the electrode face 32 of the second semiconductor element 8 are joined by means of flip-chip bonding, and the first semiconductor element 3 and second semiconductor element 8 are stacked (step U). In addition, underfill material 4 is introduced to the gap between the first semiconductor element 3 and second semiconductor element 8 and to the periphery thereof, whereby the bump 33 is protected (step V).",
        "As shown in FIG. 20D, the tape carrier 41 is bonded via the die-bonding material 7 to the other face of the first semiconductor element 3 (step W). Here, an insulating paste, an insulating sheet, or the like, can be adopted as the die-bonding material 7 but an insulating sheet is used here. Further, the inner leads 43 of the tape carrier 41 are connected to the bonding pads 9 of the second semiconductor element 8 such that the second semiconductor element 8 and tape carrier 41 are electrically connected (step X).",
        "As shown in FIG. 20E, in order to protect the first semiconductor element 3, second semiconductor element 8, and inner leads 43, sealing resin 13 is made to fill and seal the periphery of the first semiconductor element 3 and the wiring portion of the inner leads 43 from the other face of the second semiconductor element 8 to the tape carrier 41. Here the sealing fill region 20 for the sealing resin 13 is formed over substantially the same area as the external dimensions of the second semiconductor element 8 (step Y).",
        "Finally, as shown in FIG. 20F, the external terminal electrodes 11 are attached to the other face of the tape carrier 41, whereby fabrication of the semiconductor device is completed.",
        "Second Fabrication Method of the Semiconductor Device: Wafer Package Dicing",
        "The second fabrication method of the semiconductor device according to the sixth embodiment will now be described with reference to FIGS. 21A to 21F.",
        "As shown in FIG. 21A, the electrode 31 is provided on the one face of the first semiconductor element 3.",
        "As shown in FIG. 21B, the bump 33 is formed on the electrode face 31. As shown in FIG. 21C, the tape carrier 41 is bonded via the die-bonding material 7 to the other face of the first semiconductor element 3 (step W).",
        "As shown in FIG. 21D, the second semiconductor element 8 is in the state of wafer substrate 15 (before dicing) on which a plurality of the second semiconductor elements 8 is integrally formed. The electrode faces 32 of each of the second semiconductor elements 8 in the state of the wafer substrate 15 and bumps 33 of the electrode faces 31 of the first semiconductor element 3 are joined via a conductive adhesive 5 by means of flip-chip bonding and the first semiconductor elements 3 are each stacked on respective second semiconductor elements 8 (step U). Further, underfill material 4 is introduced between the first semiconductor element 3 and second semiconductor element 8, whereby bumps 33 are protected (step V). In addition, the inner leads 43 of the tape carrier 41 are connected to the bonding pads 9 of the second semiconductor element 8 such that the tape carrier 41 and second semiconductor element 8 are electrically connected (step X).",
        "As shown in FIG. 21E, sealing resin 13 is made to fill and seal between the second semiconductor element 8 and tape carrier 41 and the periphery thereof. External terminal electrodes 11 are also attached to the tape carrier 41 (step Y).",
        "As shown in FIG. 21F, the wafer substrate 15 is diced by using a blade and individual semiconductor devices are produced, whereby fabrication of the semiconductor device is completed (step Z).",
        "By using these fabrication steps, a plurality of the semiconductor devices can be fabricated by performing together the flip-chip bonding step (step U), the underfill material introduction step (step V), the lead connection step (step X), the resin-sealing step (step Y), and the dicing step (step Z), which permits efficient fabrication.",
        "According to the above constitution, in comparison with the first and second embodiments, by using the inner leads 43 in place of the fine metal wires 10 and changing the semiconductor carrier 1 to the tape carrier 41, a thinner-type semiconductor device can be provided. In particular, because the inner leads 43 are integrally extended from the tape carrier 41 and connected to the bonding pads 9 of the second semiconductor element 8, the semiconductor device is constituted such that, not only are there are no protrusions on the other face of the tape carrier 41, which permits a thinner semiconductor device, but implementation of a constitution that is also externally simple is also possible and the mounting height h of the external terminal electrodes 11 can be reduced. Further, because the first semiconductor element 3 and second semiconductor element 8 have a COC (Chip On Chip) structure, a high-speed operation between the first semiconductor element 3 and second semiconductor element 8 is permitted.",
        "Further, as shown in FIG. 22, the semiconductor device may have a constitution in which pluralities of first semiconductor elements 3a and 3b are arranged on the one face of a tape carrier 85.",
        "Furthermore, in the case of the semiconductor devices of all the embodiments above, a highly exothermic power IC can be used as the second semiconductor element 8. This is because the rear face of the second semiconductor element 8 is not resin-sealed and is exposed to the outside, whereby heat can be radiated efficiently. Thus, application is possible even in the case of a semiconductor device that is required to be highly exothermic."
