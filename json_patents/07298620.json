    "description": [
        "The present invention relates to a heat dissipation device, and particularly to a heat dissipation device for an integrated circuit package.",
        "Continuing development of integrated circuit technology has rendered integrated circuit packages (IC packages) such as central processing units (CPUs) to operate at a higher and higher speed. Heat generated by these modern IC packages has increased commensurately. Accumulation of heat will result in an increasing of temperature of the IC packages, and consequently result in instability of operation or even damage of the IC packages. For above reason, the heat must be efficiently removed in order to maintain a normal operation of the IC packages.",
        "Various heat sink configurations for heat dissipation of IC packages are developed. Along with continuous increase of heat-generating, conventional heat sinks dissipating heat merely by natural metal thermal conduction have not met the requirement of heat dissipation of the heat-generating IC packages. In recent years, heat pipes have been widely used due to their fast heat-transferring capacity. Accordingly, heat sinks using heat pipes are more and more popular.",
        "A typical heat sink with heat pipes is shown in FIG. 4. Referring to FIG. 4, the heat sink has a base 100, two vertical U-shaped heat pipes 200 installed on the base 100 and a plurality of parallel fins 300 through which the heat pipes 200 extend. The heat sink absorbs heat generated by an IC package (not shown) by the base 100. The heat on the base 100 is speedily transferred, via the heat pipes 200, to the fins 300 for further heat dissipation to avoid overheating of the IC package.",
        "To maximize heat dissipation surface area, the fins are made to have large sizes, however, a heat pipe 200 usually has a small diameter. So, contacting area between the heat pipes and the fins is not enough to establish a satisfactory heat connection. On the other hand, each large-sized fin is supported by the heat pipes only at several points and all the fins are isolated to each other. The fins 300 cannot have a robust structure. When a fan is used for providing a forced airflow through the fins 300 to facilitate heat removal, vibration and noise generated by the fins 300 are unavoidable. The vibration will be partly transferred to the base 100 of the heat sink and even to the IC package, thereby adversely impacting normal operation of the IC package, such as stability or life span thereof. The noise is more considerable and insufferable when a resonant vibration occurs. So it is necessary to improve the heat sink to remove said disadvantage and gain a high heat dissipation performance.",
        "Therefore, it is desired to evolve a heat dissipation device to overcome above-mentioned problems.",
        "Accordingly, what is needed is a heat dissipation device having a strong structure and a high heat dissipation performance.",
        "A heat dissipation device in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a base, a heat dissipation member comprising two heat-dissipating plate groups intercrossed with each other so as to define a plurality of passages arranged in a matrix having a plurality of rows and columns, and a heat pipe connecting the base with the heat dissipation member to transfer heat from the base to the heat dissipation member. A first heat sink and a second heat sink cooperate with the heat dissipation member and sandwich the heat dissipation member therebetween.",
        "Other advantages and novel features of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",
        "FIG. 1 is an isometric view of a heat dissipation device in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention;",
        "FIG. 2 is a front elevational view of FIG. 1;",
        "FIG. 3 is an exploded view of FIG. 1; and",
        "FIG. 4 is an exploded, isometric view of a conventional heat dissipation device.",
        "Reference will now be made to the drawing figures to describe a heat dissipation device in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.",
        "The heat dissipation device is for being mounted to an heat-generating electronic device, such as an IC package (not shown), to dissipate heat therefrom. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 3, the heat dissipation device comprises a base 10 for contacting the electronic device to absorb heat therefrom, a heat dissipation member 20 for dissipating heat, three U-shaped heat pipes 50 connecting the heat dissipation member 20 with the base 10 for transferring heat from the base to the heat dissipation member 20. A first heat sink 30 and a second heat sink 40 are respectively connected to two lateral sides (not labeled) of the heat dissipation member 20 and sandwich the heat dissipation member 20 therebetween.",
        "The base 10, generally being made of cooper and a rectangle flat plate, has a bottom face (not shown) for contacting the electronic device, and a top face 12 which is opposite to the bottom face and define three parallel grooves 13 therein. Four fixing legs 14, each defining a mounting hole (not labeled), extend respectively from four corners of the base 10. Bolts 60 with springs (not labeled) thereon extend through the holes of the fixing legs 14 for securing the heat dissipation device to a substrate (not shown) on which the electronic device is mounted.",
        "The heat pipes 50 each comprise an evaporating portion 52 received in a corresponding groove 13 of the base 10 and two parallel condensing portions 54 extending perpendicularly upwardly from opposite ends of the evaporating portion 52. The evaporating portions 52 are thermally connected with the base 10 and a bottom of the heat dissipation member 20 when the base 10, the heat dissipation member 20 and the heat pipes 50 are assembled together. The condensing portions 54 of each heat pipe 50 extend away from and perpendicular to the base 10.",
        "Particularly referring to FIGS. 2-3, the heat dissipation member 20 comprises two parallel heat spreaders 22, 24 which are perpendicular to the base 10 and located at the two lateral sides of the heat dissipation member 20, a plurality of first heat-dissipating plates 23 which are parallel to the base 10 and connect the two heat spreaders 22, 24, and a plurality of second heat-dissipating plates 25 which are perpendicularly intercrossed with the first heat-dissipating plates 23 and located between the heat spreaders 22, 24. Each of the heat spreaders 22, 24 defines three grooves 29 in an outer lateral face thereof. The first heat-dissipating plates 23 are perpendicular to the heat spreaders 22, 24 and the second heat-dissipating plates 25 are parallel to the heat spreaders 22, 24. The first heat-dissipating plate 23 and the second heat-dissipating plate 25 therefore define a plurality of parallel air passages 27 between the two heat spreaders 22, 24 and each air passage 27 has two opposite ventilating ports, i.e., front and rear ventilating ports (not labeled) and a square cross section. Top and bottom ones of the heat-dissipating plates 23 and the two heat spreaders 22, 24 jointly form an outline border for the heat dissipation member 20. The first and second heat-dissipating plates 23, 25 are interweaved together. The air passages 27 are arranged as having a plurality of rows and columns in the heat dissipation member 20. The heat dissipation member 20, including the first and second heat-dissipating plates 23, 25 and the spreaders 22, 24 are integrally fabricated by metal extrusion.",
        "The first heat sink 30 and the second heat sink 40 are constructed in the same manner. The first heat sink 30 comprises a conductive plate 32 connected with the heat spreader 22. The conductive plate 32 has a heat-absorbing face (not labeled) mating with the lateral face of the heat spreader 22 and a heat-dissipating face (not labeled) opposite to the heat-absorbing face. The heat-absorbing face of the conductive plate 32 defines three grooves 33 corresponding to the grooves 29 of the heat spreader 22. The grooves 29, 33 jointly form three channels in which the condensing portions 54 of the heat pipes 50 extend. The heat-dissipating face of the conductive plate 32 forms a plurality of first fins 35 extending laterally and outwardly, parallel to the base 10. The second heat sink 40 comprises a conductive plate 42 connected with the heat spreader 24. The conductive plate 42 has a heat-absorbing face (not labeled) mating with the lateral face of the heat spreader 24 and a heat-dissipating face (not labeled) opposite to the heat-absorbing face. The heat-absorbing face of the conductive plate 42 defines three grooves 43 corresponding to the grooves 29 of the heat spreader 24. The grooves 29 43 jointly form three channels in which the condensing portions 54 of the heat pipes 50 extend. The heat-dissipating face of the conductive plate 42 forms a plurality of second fins 45 extending laterally and outwardly, parallel to the base 10.",
        "The two heat sinks 30 40 are connected with the heat dissipation member 20 by soldering and sandwich the heat dissipation member 20 therebetween. The condensing portions 54 of the heat pipes 50 are sandwiched between the conductive plates 32, 42 of the heat sinks 30, 40 and the heat spreaders 22, 24, respectively.",
        "When the heat dissipation device applied to the heat-generating electronic device, the base 10 contacts the electronic device and absorbs heat therefrom. The heat is partly conducted to the bottom portion of the heat dissipation member 20 and travels upwardly. A majority of the heat is absorbed by the evaporating portions 52 of the heat pipes 50, travels along the heat pipe 50, and are transferred to the heat spreaders 22, 24 and the two heat sinks 30, 40 via the condensing portions 54 of the heat pipes 50 for being dissipated out by the heat dissipating plates 23, 25 and the fins 35, 45.",
        "The first heat-dissipating plates 23 and the second heat-dissipating plates 25 of the dissipation member 20 are intercrossed with each other. Each first heat-dissipating plate 23 is anchored by a plurality of second heat-dissipating plates 25 that are intercrossed with the first heat-dissipating plate 23, so is each second heat-dissipating plate 25. So, the heat dissipation member 20 has a solid heat-dissipating plate structure. When a forced airflow passes through the heat dissipation member 20, noise and vibration is effectively diminished. On the other hand, the intercrossed heat-dissipating plate configuration avails to form an even and smooth heat distribution in the heat dissipation member 20. Utilization of the heat dissipation member 20 increases; accordingly heat dissipation performance of the heat dissipation device is enhanced.",
        "In said embodiment of the present invention, the heat pipes 50 are sandwiched between the first and second heat sinks 30, 40 and the heat spreaders 22, 24 instead of extending through the heat dissipation member 20, which makes the heat dissipation device to be easily manufactured. A good heat-transferring between the heat pipes 50 and the heat dissipation member 20, the heat sinks 30, 40 can be established, accordingly, heat dissipation performance of the heat dissipation device is improved.",
        "It is believed that the present invention and its advantages will be understood from the foregoing description, and it will be apparent that various changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention or sacrificing all of its material advantages, the examples hereinbefore described merely being preferred or exemplary embodiments of the invention."
