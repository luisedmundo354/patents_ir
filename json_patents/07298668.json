In the 2R\u00d74 configuration, semiconductor components are arranged in two rows on a top side of a module board and semiconductor memory components are likewise arranged in two rows on an underside of the module board. In contrast to a \u201cStacked DRAM\u201d design, the semiconductor components in accordance with the planar design contain only one memory chip. By using a parallel routing for a command address bus and an on-die termination bus, the address, clock, and control buses can be adapted in terms of load, so that different signal propagation times on the different buses are avoided to the greatest possible extent.",

        "This application claims priority under 35 USC \u00a7119 to German Application No. DE 102005005064.6, filed on Feb. 3, 2005, and titled \u201cSemiconductor Memory Module with Bus Architecture,\u201d the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory module in which a control circuit drives a plurality of memory chips via control, clock, and address buses.",
        "In a semiconductor memory module, such as an FBDIMM (Fully Buffered Dual-In line Memory Module), for example, a plurality of semiconductor memory components which are driven by a memory controller via a control component, for example a hub chip, rather than directly, are arranged on a module board. Four FBDIMM module cards which differ in terms of their clock frequency and their bit rate, inter alia, have been standardized at the present time. The FBDIMM cards that have been standardized at the present time include the FBD400 card having a bit rate of 400 Mbit/s, the FBD533 card having a bit rate of 533 Mbit/s, the FBD667 card having a bit rate of 667 Mbit/s and the FBD800 card having a bit rate of 800 Mbit/s.",
        "In a 2R\u00d74 design configuration, 18 memory chips are situated per \u201cRank\u201d on a DIMM module. The memory chips are arranged in the semiconductor memory components on the module board in a stacked arrangement (Stacked DRAM Device). In a 2\u00d7 stack (Dual Stack) design, two memory chips are arranged in stacked manner within a semiconductor memory component. The individual memory chips are driven by a control circuit on the hub chip for storing or for reading out a stored information item via control, address, and clock buses. In an FBDIMM memory module of the 2R\u00d74 configuration, the control circuit of the hub chip makes four clock signals available, of which two clock signals are used for supplying the memory chips arranged on a left-hand side of the hub chip, and two clock signals are used for driving memory chips arranged on a right-hand side of the hub chip. Given a total of 36 memory chips present on an FBDIMM module of the 2R\u00d74 configuration, nine semiconductor memory components each having two memory chips are arranged on the left-hand side of the hub chip and nine semiconductor memory components each having two memory chips are arranged on the right-hand side of the hub chip. Therefore, a total of 18 memory chips have to be driven by the control circuit of the hub chip on both sides of the hub chip.",
        "For driving the memory chips, the hub chip provides four clock signals, of which two clock signals are used for the memory chips on the left-hand side and two clock signals are used for the memory chips on the right-hand side of the hub chip. For this purpose, the hub chip drives two clock buses on the left-hand side and two clock buses on the right-hand side of the hub chip. In accordance with a JEDEC standard, ten memory chips in each case are connected to a first clock bus on the left-hand and right-hand sides of the hub chip and eight memory chips in each case are connected to a second clock bus on the left-hand and right-hand sides of the hub chip. The clock buses thus have the configuration 10/8/10/8.",
        "For selecting a memory chip, the hub chip provides four select signals (Chip Select Signals). Of these, in each case two select signals are used for the memory chips on the left-hand side of the hub chip and in each case two select signals are used for the memory chips on the right-hand side of the hub chip. In accordance with a JEDEC standard, in each case two control buses are available to the hub chip for transmitting the select signals on the left-hand side and likewise in each case two control buses (CTRL buses) are available on the right-hand side of the hub chip. Of the 36 memory chips, nine memory chips in each case are connected to each of the control buses. The control buses thus have the configuration 9/9/9/9.",
        "For addressing individual memory cells of each of the memory chips, the hub chip makes address signals available. For addressing a memory cell of memory chips which are arranged on the left-hand side of the hub chip, the hub chip is connected to a first address bus, a so-called \u201cCommand Address Bus\u201d (CA bus) on the left-hand side and to a second address bus (Command Address Bus, CA Bus) on the right-hand side. Of the 36 memory chips, 18 memory chips in each case are connected to each of the two address buses.",
        "On account of the different load distributions on the clock, control, and address buses, performance losses occur particularly in the case of the cards FBD667 and FBD800. The performance losses relate principally to a non-matched timing behavior (\u201coutput timing\u201d) of the signals on the different buses. As a result of the different signal propagation times on the different buses, a so-called \u201cearly timing\u201d is used on the CA bus particularly in the case of FBD667 and FBD800. In this case, the hub chip emits the different control signals in a delayed manner or in an early manner. However, such a method is very complicated and susceptible to errors since the hub chip has to supervise the control signals on the CA bus and the CTRL bus separately from one another.",
        "In order to obtain a good signal integrity in the FBD667 and FBD800 cards, the memory chips within the semiconductor memory components are provided with an additional input pin, via which a termination resistor (on-die termination resistor) can be switched on. The termination resistor, which is formed as an embedded resistor, is switched on for a write access.",
        "In order to obtain a good signal integrity, it is necessary to provide an on-die termination resistor of an order of magnitude of 50 \u03a9. However, a termination resistor of 50 \u03a9 has not yet been standardized at the present time. Instead, on-die termination resistors of 75 \u03a9 or 150 \u03a9 are used in accordance with a JEDEC recommendation. However, such resistors prove to be problematic with regard to the signal integrity during writing in the case of a semiconductor memory module of the 2R\u00d74 configuration with \u201cDual Stacked DRAMs\u201d.",
        "A further disadvantage of an FBDIMM module card in the \u201cStacked Chip\u201d design is the high costs associated therewith.",
        "The present invention provides a semiconductor memory module with a cost-effective design in which the control, clocks and address buses, for the time-synchronous transmission of control, clock and address signals, are matched in terms of load to the greatest possible extent among one another.",
        "The semiconductor memory module with bus architecture according to the invention comprises a module board, semiconductor memory components each containing a memory chip, the memory chip comprising a memory cell array having memory cells for storing data, and a control component for controlling the memory chips. Furthermore, the module board contains: a plurality of control buses for transmitting a select signal from the control component to a number of the memory chips for selection of one of the memory chips for storing data, the same number of memory chips being connected to each of the control buses; a plurality of address buses for transmitting address signals from the control component to a number of the memory chips for selection of one of the memory cells of the selected memory chip, the same number of memory chips being connected to each of the address buses; and a plurality of clock buses for transmitting a clock signal from the control component to a number of the memory chips for clock-synchronous operation of the memory chips, the same number of memory chips being connected to each of the clock buses. The semiconductor memory components and the control component are arranged on the module board. Furthermore, the number of control buses matches the number of clock buses and the number of memory chips connected to each of the control buses is the same as the number of memory chips connected to each of the clock buses.",
        "The invention makes it possible to construct a memory module as a planar memory module in which each of the semiconductor memory components contains precisely one memory chip. The planar design of the memory module constitutes a more cost-effective variant than a \u201cStacked DRAM\u201d design, for example, in which each of the semiconductor memory components contains two or more memory chips in a stacked arrangement. The realization of a planar design requires a modification of the bus architecture used hitherto for the address, control and clock buses. In the case of the bus architectures according to the invention for the address, control, and clock buses, the different buses are matched among one another in terms of load. As a result, it is possible to obtain as far as possible identical signal propagation times for the address, control, and clock signals, so that a delay of signals by the hub chip is no longer required. Furthermore, a 75 \u03a9 or 150 \u03a9 resistor proposed as standard can be used as the on-die termination resistor.",

Consequently, 36 memory chips are provided in the 2R(Rank)\u00d74 configuration.",
        "Instead of using a \u201cStacked DRAM\u201d design, the invention proposes using a planar FBDIMM 2R\u00d74 design. In the case of the planar design in accordance with FIG. 2A, in each case only one memory chip is situated in each semiconductor memory component. On the top side O1 of the semiconductor memory module, the planar memory chips U1, U3, U5, U7, U9, U11, U13, and U15 are situated on the left-hand side S1. The memory chips U17, U19, U21, U23, U25, U27, U29, and U31 are situated on the right-hand side S2 of the surface O1. In this case, the memory chips are arranged in two rows R11 and R12.

In this case, too, the memory chips are arranged in two rows, a row R21 and a row R22.",
        "The memory chips have memory cells of the DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) memory cell type. FIG. 3 shows a simplified illustration of a memory cell array SZF of a memory chip from FIGS. 2A and 2B. Within the memory cell array SZF, memory cells SZ are arranged along word lines WL and bit lines BL. A DRAM memory cell has a selection transistor AT and a storage capacitor SC. During the addressing of the memory cell SZ illustrated, the selection transistor AT is controlled to the on state by a corresponding control signal on the word line WL, so that the storage capacitor SC is conductively connected to the bit line BL for the purpose of reading out an item of information or for the purpose of writing in an item of information. In the event of a write access, a termination resistor (On-Die Termination resistor) ODTW embedded in a silicon chip is activated by a control signal ODTS. A connected data bus DQ is terminated by the resistor. In accordance with a JEDEC specification, the termination resistor ODTW is formed as a 75 \u03a9 resistor or as a 150 \u03a9 resistor. It is found that a good signal integrity can be obtained in the case of a 75 \u03a9 resistor or in the case of a 150 \u03a9 resistor when using the planar card design in contrast to the \u201cStacked DRAM\u201d design. The use of a 50 \u03a9 resistor, as was necessary in the case of the FBD667 and FBD800 cards in the \u201cStacked\u201d design in order to obtain a good signal integrity, is not necessary when using a planar chip design in which each of the semiconductor memory components contains only one memory chip. The JEDEC standard for the order of magnitude of the on-die termination resistors can thus be complied with.",
        "FIG. 4 shows the control component SB for driving the memory chips. The control component has internally within it a hub chip HC with a control circuit AS. In accordance with a JEDEC standard, the control circuit AS drives an address bus (Command Address Bus, CA bus) CAB1 on the side S1 and a CA bus CAB2 on the side S2. According to the invention, the CA bus CAB1 is split into a partial bus TB1CAB1 and a partial bus TB2CAB1 at a node. On the side S2, the CA bus CAB2 is likewise divided into a partial bus TB1CAB2 and a partial bus TB2CAB2 at a node.",

On the side S2, the drive circuit AS likewise provides two clock signals which are fed onto a CLK bus CLKB3 and CLKB4.",
        "For selecting a memory chip for a storage process, the control circuit AS provides four select signals (Chip Select), a respective one of which is fed onto the control bus (CTRL bus) CTRLB1 and CTRLB2 on the side S1 of the control component and onto the control bus CTRLB3 and CTRLB4 on the side S2 of the control component.",

        "The memory chips U2, U4, U6, U8, U10, U12, U14, and U16 and also the ECC memory chips U33 and U35 are driven by a single CA\u2032 bus, as has been the case hitherto when using a \u201cStacked DRAM\u201d design. The CA\u2032 bus is terminated by a termination resistor R\u2032CA. FIG. 6 shows the structure of an individual CA\u2032 bus section which is driven by the control circuit AS with an address signal. The numerical values at the bus segments (\u201cStub Elements\u201d) that are specified in the following structural drawings of the buses specify the length of the stub elements in the order of magnitude \u00d710\u22122 mm. The abbreviation TOP designates a stub element of a bus on the surface O1 of the outer layer, whereas the abbreviation BOT corresponds to a stub element on the surface O2 of the module board. The nodes Vi specify via holes of the module board. The abbreviation INT specifies the course of a stub element in an inner layer of the multilayer module board MP.",
        "In accordance with FIG. 6, the control circuit drives the CA\u2032 bus with an address signal A0 by a stub element on the top side O1 of the multilayer module board MP having the length 1.45 mm. A crossing by which the control circuit AS is connected to the ECC memory chips U33 and U35 is arranged at a via hole V1. On an internal layer INT7, the main bus section is continued further up to a via hole V2, where a next crossing is arranged, which connects the main bus by a bus section to the memory chips U1 and U9 arranged on the surface O1. A bus section likewise branches from the via hole V2 onto the underside O2 of the multilayer module board to the memory chips U2 and U10. By the via holes V3, V4 and V5, the remaining memory chips on the side S1 of the top side O1 and the underside U2 of the multiplayer board are connected to the main bus section and the control circuit AS. The main bus section is terminated at its end by a termination resistor RCA\u2032, which is connected to a reference potential GND by a voltage source Vtt.",
        "Such a bus structure has been recommended according to a JEDEC standard for FBDIMM semiconductor memory modules. When using a module board populated in planar fashion, however, for space reasons it is impossible to connect the 18 memory chips illustrated in FIG. 6 to the main bus section by such a large number of crossings. In this case, it must additionally be taken into account that in total just for the transmission of 16 address signals, three bank address signals, one ODT activation signal, two chip select signals, two command enable signals, three control signals /RAS, /CAS, /WE and four differential clock signals, up to 31 of such bus structures have to be provided between the memory chips and the control circuit AS.",
        "The invention therefore proposes modifying the previous JEDEC recommendation for bus structures. FIG. 5 shows a division of the CA bus into a first partial bus TB1CAB and a second partial bus TB2CAB on the side S2 of the underside O2. The two partial buses are terminated by termination resistors RCA on the surface of the module board. The first partial bus TB1CAB has four nodes corresponding to positions of via holes of the module board. The first partial bus TB1CAB branches at a first via hole and connects the memory chip U18, by a crossing to the underside O2, to the main bus section TB1CAB of the first partial bus and, by a crossing illustrated suggestively in FIG. 5, to the memory chip U17 situated opposite the memory chip U18 on the surface O1 of the module board. The main bus section of the first partial bus TB1CAB is likewise connected, at a subsequent via hole, to the memory chip U20 on the underside and to the opposite memory chip U19 on the top side of the module board. At a subsequent via hole, the main bus section TB1CAB once again has a crossing, by which the memory chip U22 on the underside O2 and the memory chip U21 on the top side O1 of the module board are connected to the main bus section TB1CAB. A crossing which connects the memory chip U24 on the underside and the memory chip U23 on the opposite top side of the module board to the partial bus TB1CAB is arranged at a last via hole. Correspondingly, also at the second partial bus TB2CAB routed parallel to the first partial bus TB1, a total of four crossing points are provided at via holes of the module board, which connect the memory chips U26, U28, U30, and U32 and also the ECC memory chip 35 on the underside of the module board to the second partial bus TB2CAB and, on the top side, the opposite memory chips U25, U27, U29, and U31 to the second partial bus TB2CAB.",
        "FIG. 7 shows an enlarged illustration of the coupling of the control circuit AS to the CA bus CAB1. The address bus CAB1 branches at a via hole V1 into a first partial bus TB1CAB1, which is routed in an inner layer INT8 of the multilayer board, and a second partial bus TB2CAB1, which is routed parallel to the partial bus TB1CAB1 in an inner layer INT6 of the multilayer board (parallel routing). The two partial buses are terminated by a termination resistor RCA connected to a voltage source Vtt. The first partial bus TB1CAB1 is connected by via holes VTB1CAB1 to the memory chips U1, U3, U5, and U7 on the top side O1 and to the memory chips U2, U4, U6, and U8 on the opposite underside of the module board. The ECC memory chip U35 is likewise connected to the partial bus TB1CAB1 by the first via hole. Correspondingly, the second partial bus TB2CAB1 is connected by via holes VTB2CAB1 to the memory chips U9, U11, U13, and U15 on the top side of the module board and to the memory chips U10, U12, U14, and U16 and also the ECC memory chip U33 on the underside of the module board. Consequently, nine load elements formed as memory chips are in each case connected both to the first partial bus TB1CAB1 and to the second partial bus TB2CAB1.",
        "FIGS. 8A and 8B show the structure according to the invention of the ODTL bus for carrying the activation signal for activating the on-die termination resistor of each of the memory chips. A \u201cparallel routing\u201d is used here, too, by virtue of the ODTB1 bus being branched at a via hole VODTB1 into a first partial bus TB1ODTB1 and a second partial bus TB2ODTB1, the partial buses running parallel to one another. Each of the partial buses is terminated by a termination resistor RODTB1 connected to a voltage source Vtt. By via holes VTB1ODTB1, the partial bus TB1ODTB1 is connected to the memory chips U1, U3, U5, and U7 on the top side of the module board and to the memory chips U2, U4, U6, and U8 and also the ECC memory chip U35 on the underside of the module board. By via holes VTB2ODTB1, the partial bus TB2ODTB1 is connected to the memory chips U9, U11, U13, and U15 on the top side of the module board and to the memory chips U10, U12, U14, and U16 and also the ECC memory chip U33 on the underside of the module board. Each partial bus of the on-die termination bus ODTB1, as well as the partial buses of the CA bus, are connected to nine load elements in each case.",

The clock buses CLKB2, CLKB3 and CLKB4, which are likewise driven by the control circuit AS in accordance with FIG. 4, have an identical construction, so that here, too, in each case nine of the memory chips are connected to each of the clock buses.",
        "FIG. 10 shows the structure of the control bus CTRLB1, which is connected to the control circuit AS on the side S1 of the module board. The control bus CTRLB1 for carrying the select signal CS has two partial buses TB1CTRLB1 and TB2CTRLB1 routed parallel, which are in each case terminated by a termination resistor RCTRL\u2032 connected to a voltage source Vtt. By via holes VTB1CTRLB1, the partial bus TB1CTRLB1 is connected to the memory chip U1, U3, U5, and U7 on the top side O1 of the module board. By via holes VTB2CTRLB1, the partial bus TB2CTRLB1 is connected to the memory chips U9, U11, U13, and U15 on the top side of the module board and also to the ECC memory chip U33 on the underside of the module board. The control bus CTRLB1 is thus likewise connected to a total of nine load elements.",
        "The use of the bus architecture for the address bus (CA bus) in accordance with FIG. 7, the bus architecture for the on-die termination bus (ODTL bus) in accordance with FIGS. 8A and 8B, the use of the bus architectures for the clock buses (CLK bus) in accordance with FIG. 9, and the use of the bus architectures for the control buses (CTRL buses) in accordance with FIG. 10 make it possible for an FBDIMM memory module of the 2R\u00d74 configuration now to be constructed in a planar DRAM design, in contrast to the hitherto customary \u201cStacked DRAM\u201d design. Both the clock buses CLKB1 and CLKB2 which drive the memory chips on the side S1 of the hub chip and the clock buses CLKB3 and CLKB4 which drive the memory chips on the side S2 of the hub chip are connected to nine load elements in each case. Nine load elements (memory chips) in each case are likewise also connected to the control buses CTRLB1 and CTRLB2 which connect the hub chip to the memory chips on the side S1 and to the control buses CTRLB3 and CTRLB4 which connect the hub chip to the memory chips on the side S2. The CA bus sections CAB1 on the side S1 and CAB2 on the side S2 are connected to 18 load elements in each case, but have in each case two partial branches which are likewise connected to nine load elements. The bus sections ODTB1 and ODTB2 are likewise subdivided into two partial buses with nine load elements in each case.",
        "This ensures that the address, clock and control buses are well matched among one another in terms of load. This has the advantage that the signal propagation times on the different buses are very well matched, so that the use of an \u201cEarly Timing\u201d by a hub chip is no longer necessary. It is furthermore evident that by using the planar FBDIMM 2R\u00d74 design in combination with the bus architectures according to the invention, the data bus DQ can now be terminated with a standard 75 \u03a9 or 150 \u03a9 resistor instead of with a 50 \u03a9 on-die termination resistor and a good signal integrity is nevertheless obtained in this case.",
