        "A number of amorphous (including glass) and glass-ceramic compositions are known. Many oxide glass systems utilize well-known glass-formers such as SiO2, B2O3, P2O5, GeO2, TeO2, As2O3, and V2O5 to aid in the formation of the glass. Some of the glasses can be heat-treated to form glass ceramics.",
        "Many properties of known glasses and glass-ceramics may be limited by the intrinsic properties of glass-formers. For example, for SiO2, B2O3, and P2O5-based glasses and glass-ceramics, the Young's modulus, hardness, and strength are typically limited by such glass formers. These glass and glass-ceramics generally have inferior mechanical properties as compared, for example, to Al2O3 or ZrO3.",
        "In another aspect, in general, during most ceramic processing operations, it is desirable to obtain maximum densification with minimum grain size (e.g. without significant crystal growth). Exemplary ceramic processing techniques that may lead to minimizing grain size include decreasing crystal growth rate. Although not wanting to be bound by theory, in general, it is believed in the ceramic art that larger crystal sizes lead to reduced mechanical properties while finer average crystallite sizes lead to improved mechanical properties (e.g., higher strength and higher hardness).",

In addition, or alternatively, the HfO2 source may contain, or provide HfO2, as well as other metal oxides such as ZrO2.",
        "For embodiments comprising ZrO2 and HfO2, the weight ratio of ZrO2:HfO2 may be in a range of 1:zero (i.e., all ZrO2; no HfO2) to zero:1, as well as, for example, at least about 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 90, 85, 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, and 5 parts (by weight) ZrO2 and a corresponding amount of Hfo2 (e.g., at least about 99 parts (by weight) ZrO2 and not greater than about 1 part HfO2) and at least about 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 90, 85, 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, and 5 parts HfO2 and a corresponding amount of ZrO2.",
        "Other useful metal oxides may also include, on a theoretical oxide basis, BaO, CaO, Cr2O3, CoO, Fe2O3, GeO2, Li2O, MgO, MnO, NiO, Na2O, Sc2O3, SrO, TiO2, ZnO, Y2O3, and combinations thereof. Sources, including commercial sources, include the oxides themselves, metal powders, complex oxides, ores, carbonates, acetates, nitrates, chlorides, hydroxides, etc. For example, sources, including commercial sources, of (on a theoretical oxide basis) Y2O3 include yttrium oxide powders, yttrium, yttrium-containing ores, and yttrium salts (e.g., yttrium carbonates, nitrates, chlorides, hydroxides, and combinations thereof). The Y2O3 source may contain, or only provide, Y2O3. Alternatively, the Y2O3 source may contain, or provide Y2O3, as well as one or more metal oxides other than Y2O3 (including materials of or containing complex Y2O3 metal oxides (e.g., Y3Al5O12)).",
        "In some embodiments, it may be advantageous for at least a portion of a metal oxide source (in some embodiments, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or even 100 percent by weight) to be obtained by adding particulate, metallic material comprising at least one of a metal (e.g., Al, Ca, Cu, Cr, Fe, Li, Mg, Ni, Ag, Ti, Zr, and combinations thereof), M, that has a negative enthalpy of oxide formation or an alloy thereof to the melt, or otherwise combining them with the other raw materials. Although not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that the heat resulting from the exothermic reaction associated with the oxidation of the metal is beneficial in the formation of a homogeneous melt and resulting glass. For example, it is believed that the additional heat generated by the oxidation reaction within the raw material eliminates, minimizes, or at least reduces insufficient heat transfer, and hence facilitates formation and homogeneity of the melt, particularly when forming glass particles with x, y, and z dimensions over 50 (over 100, or even over 150) micrometers. It is also believed that the availability of the additional heat aids in driving various chemical reactions and physical processes (e.g., densification, and spherodization) to completion. Further, it is believed for some embodiments, the presence of the additional heat generated by the oxidation reaction actually enables the formation of a melt, which otherwise is difficult or not practical due to high melting point of the materials. Further, the presence of the additional heat generated by the oxidation reaction actually enables the formation of glass that otherwise could not be made, or could not be made in the desired size range. Another advantage of the invention includes, in forming the glasses, that many of the chemical and physical processes such as melting, densification and spherodizing can be achieved in a short time, so that very high quench rates may be achieved. For additional details, see co-pending application having U.S. Ser. No. 10/211,639, filed the Aug. 2, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "In one aspect of the invention, the raw materials are fed independently to form the molten mixture. In another aspect of the invention, certain raw materials are mixed together, while other raw materials are added independently into the molten mixture. In some embodiments, for example, the raw materials are combined or mixed together prior to melting. The raw materials may be combined in any suitable and known manner to form a substantially homogeneous mixture. These combining techniques include ball milling, mixing, tumbling and the like. The milling media in the ball mill may be metal balls, ceramic balls and the like. The ceramic milling media may be, for example, alumina, zirconia, silica, magnesia and the like. The ball milling may occur dry, in an aqueous environment, or in a solvent-based (e.g., isopropyl alcohol) environment. If the raw material batch contains metal powders, then it is generally desired to use a solvent during milling. This solvent may be any suitable material with the appropriate flash point and ability to disperse the raw materials. The milling time may be from a few minutes to a few days, generally between a few hours to 24 hours. In a wet or solvent based milling system, the liquid medium is removed, typically by drying, so that the resulting mixture is typically homogeneous and substantially devoid of the water and/or solvent. If a solvent based milling system is used, during drying, a solvent recovery system may be employed to recycle the solvent. After drying, the resulting mixture may be in the form of a \u201cdried cake\u201d. This cake-like mixture may then be broken up or crushed into the desired particle size prior to melting. Alternatively, for example, spray-drying techniques may be used. The latter typically provides spherical particulates of a desired oxide mixture. The precursor material may also be prepared by wet chemical methods including precipitation and sol-gel. Such methods will be beneficial if extremely high levels of homogeneity are desired.",
        "Particulate raw materials are typically selected to have particle sizes such that the formation of a homogeneous melt can be achieved rapidly. Typically, raw materials with relatively small average particle sizes and narrow distributions are used for this purpose. In some methods (e.g., flame forming and plasma spraying), particularly desirable particulate raw materials are those having an average particle size in a range from about 5 nm to about 50 micrometers (in some embodiments, in a range from about 10 nm to about 20 micrometers, or even about 15 nm to about 1 micrometer), wherein at least 90 (in some embodiments, 95, or even 100) percent by weight of the particulate is the raw material, although sizes outside of the sizes and ranges may also be useful. Particulate less than about 5 nm in size tends to be difficult to handle (e.g., the flow properties of the feed particles tended to be undesirable as they tend to have poor flow properties). Use of particulate larger than about 50 micrometers in typical flame forming or plasma spraying processes tend to make it more difficult to obtain homogenous melts and glasses and/or the desired composition.",
        "Furthermore, in some cases, for example, when particulate material is fed in to a flame or thermal or plasma spray apparatus to form the melt, it may be desirable for the particulate raw materials to be provided in a range of particle sizes. Although not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that this maximizes the packing density and strength of the feed particles. If the raw material powders are too coarse, the feed and resulting melt particles may not have the desired composition or the uniformity. In general, the coarsest raw material particles should be smaller than the desired melt or glass particle sizes. Further, raw material particles that are too coarse, tend to generate thermal and mechanical stresses in the feed particles, for example, during a flame forming or plasma spraying step. The end result in such cases is generally fracturing of the feed particles in to particles in to smaller fragments, loss of compositional uniformity, loss of yield in desired glass particle sizes, or even incomplete melting as the fragments generally change their trajectories in a multitude of directions out of the heat source.",
        "The glasses and ceramics comprising glass can be made, for example, by heating (including in a flame or plasma) the appropriate metal oxide sources to form a melt, (desirably a homogenous melt) and then cooling the melt to provide glass. Some embodiments of glasses can be made, for example, by melting the metal oxide sources in any suitable furnace (e.g., an inductively or resistively heated furnace, a gas-fired furnace, or an electric arc furnace).",
        "The glass is typically obtained by relatively rapidly cooling the molten material (i.e., the melt). The quench rate (i.e., the cooling time) to obtain the glass depends upon many factors, including the chemical composition of the melt, the glass-forming ability of the components, the thermal properties of the melt and the resulting glass, the processing technique(s), the dimensions and mass of the resulting glass, and the cooling technique. In general, relatively higher quench rates are required to form glasses comprising higher amounts of Al2O3 (i.e., greater than 75 percent by weight Al2O3), especially in the absence of known glass formers such as SiO2, B2O3, P2O5, GeO2, TeO2, As2O3, and V2O5. Similarly, it is more difficult to cool melts into glasses in larger dimensions, as it is more difficult to remove heat fast enough.",
        "In some embodiments of the invention, the raw materials are heated into a molten state in a particulate form and subsequently cooled into glass particles. Typically, the particles have a particle size greater than 25 micrometers (in some embodiments, greater than 50, 100, 150, or even 200 micrometers).",
        "The quench rates achieved in making glasses made according to the methods of the present invention are believed to be higher than 102, 103, 104, 105 or even 106\u00b0 C./sec (i.e., a temperature drop of 1000\u00b0 C. from a molten state in less than 10 seconds, less than a second, less than a tenth of a second, less than a hundredth of a second or even less than a thousandth of a second, respectively). Techniques for cooling the melt include discharging the melt into a cooling media (e.g., high velocity air jets, liquids (e.g., cold water), metal plates (including chilled metal plates), metal rolls (including chilled metal rolls), metal balls (including chilled metal balls), and the like). Other cooling techniques known in the art include roll-chilling. Roll-chilling can. be carried out, for example, by melting the metal oxide sources at a temperature typically 20-200\u00b0 C. higher than the melting point, and cooling/quenching the melt by spraying it under high pressure (e.g., using a gas such as air, argon, nitrogen or the like) onto a high-speed rotary roll(s). Typically, the rolls are made of metal and are water-cooled. Metal book molds may also be useful for cooling/quenching the melt.",
        "The cooling rate is believed to affect the properties of the quenched glass. For instance, glass transition temperature, density and other properties of glass typically change with cooling rates.",
        "Rapid cooling may also be conducted under controlled atmospheres, such as a reducing, neutral, or oxidizing environment to maintain and/or influence the desired oxidation states, etc. during cooling. The atmosphere can also influence glass formation by influencing crystallization kinetics from undercooled liquid. For example, larger undercooling of Al2O3 melts without crystallization has been reported in argon atmosphere as compared to that in air.",
        "In one method, glasses and ceramics comprising glass can be made utilizing flame fusion as reported, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,254,981 (Castle). In this method, the metal oxide sources are fed (e.g., in the form of particles, sometimes referred to as \u201cfeed particles\u201d) directly into a burner (e.g., a methane-air burner, an acetylene-oxygen burner, a hydrogen-oxygen burner, and the like), and then quenched, for example, in water, cooling oil, air, or the like. The size of feed particles fed into the flame generally determines the size of the resulting particles comprising glass.",
        "Some embodiments of glasses can also be obtained by other techniques, such as: laser spin melting with free fall cooling, Taylor wire technique, plasmatron technique, hammer and anvil technique, centrifugal quenching, air gun splat cooling, single roller and twin roller quenching, roller-plate quenching, and pendant drop melt extraction (see, e.g., Rapid Solidification of Ceramics, Brockway et al., Metals And Ceramics Information Center, A Department of Defense Information Analysis Center, Columbus, Ohio, January, 1984). Some embodiments of glasses may also be obtained by other techniques, such as: thermal (including flame or laser or plasma-assisted) pyrolysis of suitable precursors, physical vapor synthesis (PVS) of metal precursors and mechanochemical processing.",
        "Other techniques for forming melts, cooling/quenching melts, and/or otherwise forming glass include vapor phase quenching, plasma spraying, melt-extraction, and gas or centrifugal atomization. Vapor phase quenching can be carried out, for example, by sputtering, wherein the metal alloys or metal oxide sources are formed into a sputtering target(s). The target is fixed at a predetermined position in a sputtering apparatus, and a substrate(s) to be coated is placed at a position opposing the target(s). At typical pressures of 10\u22123 torr of oxygen gas and Ar gas, a discharge is generated between the target(s) and substrate(s), and Ar or oxygen ions collide against the target to cause reaction sputtering, thereby depositing a film of composition on the substrate. For additional details regarding plasma spraying, see, for example, co-pending application having U.S. Ser. No. 10/211,640, filed Aug. 2, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "Gas atomization involves heating feed particles to convert them to a melt. A thin stream of such melt is atomized through contact with a disruptive air jet (i.e., the stream is divided into fine droplets). The resulting substantially discrete, generally ellipsoidal glass particles (e.g., beads) are then recovered. Examples of bead sizes include those having a diameter in a range of about 5 micrometers to about 3 mm. Melt-extraction can be carried out, for example, as reported in U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,870 (Strom-Olsen et al.). Container-less glass forming techniques utilizing laser beam heating as reported, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,482,758 (Weber), may also be useful in making the glass.",
        "Typically, glass-ceramics made according to the present invention, and some glasses and ceramics comprising glasses used to make such glass-ceramics, have x, y, and z dimensions each perpendicular to each other, and wherein each of the x, y, and z dimensions is at least 10 micrometers. In some embodiments, the x, y, and z dimensions are at least 30 micrometers, 35 micrometers, 40 micrometers, 45 micrometers, 50 micrometers, 75 micrometers, 100 micrometers, 150 micrometers, 200 micrometers, 250 micrometers, 500 micrometers, 1000 micrometers, 2000 micrometers, 2500 micrometers, 1 mm, 5 mm, or even at least 10 mm, if coalesced. The x, y, and z dimensions of a material are determined either visually or using microscopy, depending on the magnitude of the dimensions. The reported z dimension is, for example, the diameter of a sphere, the thickness of a coating, or the shortest dimension of a prismatic shape.",
        "The addition of certain other metal oxides may alter the properties and/or crystalline structure or microstructure of glass-ceramics made according to the present invention, as well as the processing of the raw materials and intermediates in making the ceramic. For example, oxide additions such as CaO, Li2O, MgO, and Na2O have been observed to alter both the Tg and Tx (wherein Tx, is the crystallization temperature) of glass. Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that such additions influence glass formation. Further, for example, such oxide additions may decrease the melting temperature of the overall system (i.e., drive the system toward lower melting eutectic), and ease glass formation. Compositions based upon complex eutectics in multi-component systems (quaternary, etc.) may have better glass-forming ability. The viscosity of the liquid melt and viscosity of the glass in its working range may also be affected by the addition of metal oxides other than the particular required oxide(s).",
        "Crystallization of glasses and ceramics comprising the glass to form glass-ceramics may also be affected by the additions of materials. For example, certain metals, metal oxides (e.g., titanates and zirconates), and fluorides may act as nucleation agents resulting in beneficial heterogeneous nucleation of crystals. Also, addition of some oxides may change the nature of metastable phases devitrifying from the glass upon reheating. In another aspect, for glass-ceramics made according to the present invention comprising crystalline ZrO2, it may be desirable to add metal oxides (e.g., Y2O3, TiO2, CeO2, CaO, and MgO) that are known to stabilize the tetragonal/cubic form of ZrO2.",
        "The particular selection of metal oxide sources and other additives for making glass-ceramics made according to the present invention typically takes into account, for example, the desired composition, the microstructure, the degree of crystallinity, the physical properties (e.g., hardness or toughness), the presence of undesirable impurities, and the desired or required characteristics of the particular process (including equipment and any purification of the raw materials before and/or during fusion and/or solidification) being used to prepare the ceramics.",
        "In some instances, it may be preferred to incorporate limited amounts of metal oxides selected from the group consisting of: B2O3, Na2O, P2O5, SiO2, TeO2, V2O5, and combinations thereof. Sources, including commercial sources, include the oxides themselves, complex oxides, elemental (e.g., Si) powders, ores, carbonates, acetates, nitrates, chlorides, hydroxides, etc. These metal oxides may be added, for example, to modify a physical property of the resulting glass-ceramic and/or improve processing. These metal oxides, when used, are typically added from greater than 0 to 20% by weight collectively (in some embodiments, greater than 0 to 5% by weight collectively, or even greater than 0 to 2% by weight collectively) of the glass-ceramic depending, for example, upon the desired property.",
        "The microstructure or phase composition (glassy/crystalline) of a material can be determined in a number of ways. Various information can be obtained using optical microscopy, electron microscopy, differential thermal analysis (DTA), and x-ray diffraction (XRD), for example.",
        "Using optical microscopy, amorphous material is typically predominantly transparent due to the lack of light scattering centers such as crystal boundaries, while crystalline material shows a crystalline structure and is opaque due to light scattering effects.",
        "If it is desired for all the particles to be amorphous (or glass), and the resulting yield is less than 100%, the amorphous (or glass) particles may be separated from the non-amorphous (or non-glass) particles. Such separation may be done, for example, by any conventional techniques, including separating based upon density or optical clarity.",
        "Using DTA, the material is classified as amorphous if the corresponding DTA trace of the material contains an exothermic crystallization event (Tx). If the same trace also contains an endothermic event (Tg) at a temperature lower than Tx, it is considered to include a glass phase. If the DTA trace of the material contains no such events, it is considered to contain crystalline phases.",
        "Differential thermal analysis (DTA) can be conducted using the following method. DTA runs can be made (using an instrument such as that obtained from Netzsch Instruments, Selb, Germany under the trade designation \u201cNETZSCH STA 409 DTA/TGA\u201d) using a \u2212140+170 mesh size fraction (i.e., the fraction collected between 105-micrometer opening size and 90-micrometer opening size screens). An amount of each screened sample (typically about 400 milligrams (mg)) is placed in a 100-microliter Al2O3 sample holder. Each sample is heated in static air at a rate of 10\u00b0 C./minute from room temperature (about 25\u00b0 C.) to 1100\u00b0 C.",
        "Using powder x-ray diffraction, XRD, (using an x-ray diffractometer such as that obtained under the trade designation \u201cPHILLIPS XRG 3100\u201d from Phillips, Mahwah, N.J., with copper K al radiation of 1.54050 Angstrom) the phases present in a material can be determined by comparing the peaks present in the XRD trace of the crystallized material to XRD patterns of crystalline phases provided in JCPDS (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards) databases, published by International Center for Diffraction Data. Furthermore, XRD can be used qualitatively to determine types of phases. The presence of a broad diffuse intensity peak is taken as an indication of the amorphous nature of a material. The existence of both a broad peak and well-defined peaks is taken as an indication of existence of crystalline matter within a glass matrix.",
        "The initially formed glass or ceramic (including glass prior to crystallization) may be larger in size than that desired. If the glass is in a desired geometric shape and/or size, size reduction is typically not needed. The glass or ceramic can be converted into smaller pieces using crushing and/or comminuting techniques known in the art, including roll crushing, jaw crushing, hammer milling, ball milling, jet milling, impact crushing, and the like. In some instances, it is desired to have two or multiple crushing steps. For example, after the ceramic is formed (solidified), it may be in the form of larger than desired. The first crushing step may involve crushing these relatively large masses or \u201cchunks\u201d to form smaller pieces. This crushing of these chunks may be accomplished with a hammer mill, impact crusher or jaw crusher. These smaller pieces may then be subsequently crushed to produce the desired particle size distribution. In order to produce the desired particle size distribution (sometimes referred to as grit size or grade), it may be necessary to perform multiple crushing steps. In general the crushing conditions are optimized to achieve the desired particle shape(s) and particle size distribution. Resulting particles that are not of the desired size may be re-crushed if they are too large, or \u201crecycled\u201d and used as a raw material for re-melting if they are too small.",
        "The shape of particles can depend, for example, on the composition and/or microstructure of the ceramic, the geometry in which it was cooled, and the manner in which the ceramic is crushed (i.e., the crushing technique used). In general, where a \u201cblocky\u201d shape is preferred, more energy may be employed to achieve this shape. Conversely, where a \u201csharp\u201d shape is preferred, less energy may be employed to achieve this shape. The crushing technique may also be changed to achieve different desired shapes. For some particles an average aspect ratio ranging from 1:1 to 5:1 is typically desired, and in some embodiments, 1.25:1 to 3:1, or even 1.5:1 to 2.5:1.",
        "It is also within the scope of the present invention, for example, to directly form articles in desired shapes. For example, desired articles may be formed (including molded) by pouring or forming the melt into a mold. Also see, for example, the forming techniques described in application having U.S. Ser. No. 10/358,772, filed Feb. 5, 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "Embodiments of glasses and glass-ceramics made according to the present invention can be obtained without limitations in dimensions. This was found to be possible through a coalescing step performed at a temperature above the glass transition temperature. This coalescing step in essence forms a larger sized body from two or more smaller particles. For instance, a glass undergoes glass transition (Tg) before significant crystallization occurs (Tx) as evidenced by the existence of an endotherm (Tg) at lower temperature than an exotherm (Tx). For example, ceramic (including glass prior to crystallization), may also be provided by heating, for example, particles comprising the glass, and/or fibers, etc. above the Tg such that the particles, etc. coalesce to form a shape. The temperature and pressure used for coalescing may depend, for example, upon composition of the glass and the desired density of the resulting material. The temperature should be greater than the glass transition temperature. In certain embodiments, the heating is conducted at at least one temperature in a range of about 850\u00b0 C. to about 1100\u00b0 C. (in some embodiments, 900\u00b0 C. to 1000\u00b0 C.). Typically, the glass is under pressure (e.g., greater than zero to 1 GPa or more) during coalescence to aid the coalescence of the glass. In one embodiment, a charge of the particles, etc. is placed into a die and hot-pressing is performed at temperatures above glass transition where viscous flow of glass leads to coalescence into a relatively large part. Examples of typical coalescing techniques include hot pressing, hot isostatic pressing, hot extrusion, hot forging and the like (e.g., sintering, plasma assisted sintering). For example, particles comprising glass (obtained, for example, by crushing) (including beads and microspheres), fibers, etc. may formed into a larger particle size. Coalescing may also result in a body shaped into a desired form (e.g., a geometric shape). In some embodiments, the shaped body is a rod having an aspect ratio greater than 1:1, or even greater than 2:1. In some embodiments, it is desirable to cool the resulting coalesced body before further heat treatment. After heat treatment if so desired, the coalesced body may be crushed to smaller particle sizes or a desired particle size distribution.",
        "Coalescing of the glass may also be accomplished by a variety of methods, including pressure-less or pressure sintering.",
        "In general, heat-treatment can be carried out in any of a variety of ways, including those known in the art for heat-treating glass to provide glass-ceramics. For example, heat-treatment can be conducted in batches, for example, using resistive, inductively or gas heated furnaces. Alternatively, for example, heat-treatment (or a portion thereof) can be conducted continuously, for example, using a rotary kiln, fluidized bed furnaces, or pendulum kiln. In the case of a rotary kiln or a pendulum kiln, the material is typically fed directly into the kiln operating at the elevated temperature. In the case of a fluidized bed furnace, the glass to be heat-treated is typically suspended in a gas (e.g., air, inert, or reducing gasses). The time at the elevated temperature may range from a few seconds (in some embodiments, even less than 5 seconds) to a few minutes to several hours. The temperature typically ranges from the Tx of the glass to 1600\u00b0 C., more typically from 900\u00b0 C. to 1600\u00b0 C., and in some embodiments, from 1200\u00b0 C. to 1500\u00b0 C. It is also within the scope of the present invention to perform some of the heat-treatment in multiple steps (e.g., one for nucleation, and another for crystal growth; wherein densification also typically occurs during the crystal growth step). When a multiple step heat-treatment is carried out, it is typically desired to control either or both the nucleation and the crystal growth rates. In general, during most ceramic processing operations, it is desired to obtain maximum densification without significant crystal growth. Although not wanting to be bound by theory, in general, it is believed in the ceramic art that larger crystal sizes lead to reduced mechanical properties while finer average crystallite sizes lead to improved mechanical properties (e.g., higher strength and higher hardness). In particular, it is very desirable to form ceramics with densities of at least 90, 95, 97, 98, 99, or even 100 percent of theoretical density, wherein the average crystal sizes are less than 0.15 micrometer, or even less than 0.1 micrometer.",
        "In some embodiments of the present invention, the glasses or ceramics comprising glass may be annealed prior to heat-treatment. In such cases annealing is typically done at a temperature less than the Tx. of the glass for a time from a few second to few hours or even days. Typically, the annealing is done for a period of less than 3 hours, or even less than an hour. Optionally, annealing may also be carried out in atmospheres other than air. Furthermore, different stages (i.e., the nucleation step and the crystal growth step) of the heat-treatment may be carried out under different atmospheres. It is believed that the Tg and Tx, as well as the Tx-Tg of the glasses may shift depending on the atmospheres used during the heat treatment.",
        "One skilled in the art can determine the appropriate conditions from a Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) study of the glass using techniques known in the art. One skilled in the art, after reading the disclosure of the present invention should be able to provide TTT curves for glasses used to make glass-ceramics according to the present invention, determine the appropriate nucleation and/or crystal growth conditions to provide glass-ceramics according to the present invention.",
        "Heat-treatment may occur, for example, by feeding the material directly into a furnace at the elevated temperature. Alternatively, for example, the material may be fed into a furnace at a much lower temperature (e.g., room temperature) and then heated to desired temperature at a predetermined heating rate. It is within the scope of the present invention to conduct heat-treatment in an atmosphere other than air. In some cases it might be even desirable to heat-treat in a reducing atmosphere(s). Also, for example, it may be desirable to heat-treat under gas pressure as in, for example, a hot-isostatic press, or in a gas pressure furnace. Although not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that atmospheres may affect oxidation states of some of the components of the glasses and glass-ceramics. Such variation in oxidation states can bring about varying coloration of glasses and glass-ceramics. In addition, nucleation and crystallization steps can be affected by atmospheres (e.g., the atmosphere may affect the atomic mobilities of some species of the glasses).",
        "It is also within the scope of the present invention to conduct additional heat-treatment to further improve desirable properties of the material. For example, hot-isostatic pressing may be conducted (e.g., at temperatures from about 900\u00b0 C. to about 1400\u00b0 C.) to remove residual porosity, increasing the density of the material. It is within the scope of the present invention to convert (e.g., crush) the resulting article or heat-treated article to provide particles (e.g., abrasive particles made according to the present invention).",
        "Typically, glass-ceramics are stronger than the glasses from which they are formed. Hence, the strength of the material may be adjusted, for example, by the degree to which the glass is converted to crystalline ceramic phase(s). Alternatively, or in addition, the strength of the material may also be affected, for example, by the number of nucleation sites created, which may in turn be used to affect the number, and in turn the size of the crystals of the crystalline phase(s).

        "As compared to many other types of ceramic processing (e.g., sintering of a calcined material to a dense, sintered ceramic material), there is relatively little shrinkage (typically, less than 30 percent by volume; in some embodiments, less than 20 percent, 10 percent, 5 percent, or even less than 3 percent by volume) during crystallization of the glass to form the glass-ceramic. The actual amount of shrinkage depends, for example, on the composition of the glass, the heat-treatment time, the heat-treatment temperature, the heat-treatment pressure, the density of the glass being crystallized, the relative amount(s) of the crystalline phases formed, and the degree of crystallization. The amount of shrinkage can be measured by conventional techniques known in the art, including by dilatometry, Archimedes method, or measuring the dimensions of the material before and after heat-treatment. In some cases, there may be some evolution of volatile species during heat-treatment.",
        "In some embodiments, the relatively low shrinkage feature may be particularly advantageous. For example, articles may be formed in the glass phase to the desired shapes and dimensions (i.e., in near-net shape), followed by heat treatment to at least partially crystallize the glass. As a result, substantial cost savings associated with the manufacturing and machining of the crystallized material may be realized.",

        "For example, during heat-treatment of some exemplary glasses for making glass-ceramics made according to present invention, formation of phases such as La2Zr2O7 and/or cubic/tetragonal ZrO2, in some cases monoclinic ZrO2, may occur at temperatures above about 900\u00b0 C. Although not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that zirconia-related phases are the first phases to nucleate from the glass. Formation of Al2O3, ReAlO3 (wherein Re is at least one rare earth cation), ReAl11O18, Re3Al5O12, Y3Al5O12, etc. phases are believed to generally occur at temperatures above about 925\u00b0 C. Typically, crystallite size during this nucleation step is on order of nanometers. For example, crystals as small as 10-15 nanometers have been observed. For at least some embodiments, heat-treatment at about 1300\u00b0 C. for about 1 hour provides a full crystallization. In generally, heat-treatment times for each of the nucleation and crystal growth steps may range of a few seconds (in some embodiments, even less than 5 seconds) to several minutes to an hour or more.",

In vitrified bonded abrasive articles grinding aid is typically impregnated into the pores of the article.",
        "The abrasive articles can contain 100% abrasive particles made according to the present invention, or blends of such abrasive particles with other abrasive particles and/or diluent particles. However, at least about 2% by weight, desirably at least about 5% by weight, and more desirably about 30-100% by weight, of the abrasive particles in the abrasive articles should be abrasive particles made according to the present invention. In some instances, the abrasive particles according to the present invention may be blended with another abrasive particles and/or diluent particles at a ratio between 5 to 75% by weight, about 25 to 75% by weight about 40 to 60% by weight, or about 50% to 50% by weight (i.e., in equal amounts by weight). Examples of suitable conventional abrasive particles include fused aluminum oxide (including white fused alumina, heat-treated aluminum oxide and brown aluminum oxide), silicon carbide, boron carbide, titanium carbide, diamond, cubic boron nitride, garnet, fused alumina-zirconia, and sol-gel-derived abrasive particles, and the like. The sol-gel-derived abrasive particles may be seeded or non-seeded. Likewise, the sol-gel-derived abrasive particles may be randomly shaped or have a shape associated with them, such as a rod or a triangle. Examples of sol-gel abrasive particles include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,314,827 (Leitheiser et al.), 4,518,397 (Leitheiser et al.), 4,623,364 (Cottringer et al.), 4,744,802 (Schwabel), 4,770,671 (Monroe et al.), 4,881,951 (Wood et al.), 5,011,508 (Wald et al.), 5,090,968 (Pellow), 5,139,978 (Wood), 5,201,916 (Berg et al.), 5,227,104 (Bauer), 5,366,523 (Rowenhorst et al.), 5,429,647 (Larmie), 5,498,269 (Larmie), and 5,551,963 (Larmie).

In some instances, blends of abrasive particles may result in an abrasive article that exhibits improved grinding performance in comparison with abrasive articles comprising 100% of either type of abrasive particle.",
        "If there is a blend of abrasive particles, the abrasive particle types forming the blend may be of the same size. Alternatively, the abrasive particle types may be of different particle sizes. For example, the larger sized abrasive particles may be abrasive particles made according to the present invention, with the smaller sized particles being another abrasive particle type. Conversely, for example, the smaller sized abrasive particles may be abrasive particles made according to the present invention, with the larger sized particles being another abrasive particle type.",
        "Examples of suitable diluent particles include marble, gypsum, flint, silica, iron oxide, aluminum silicate, glass (including glass bubbles and glass beads), alumina bubbles, alumina beads and diluent agglomerates. Abrasive particles made according to the present invention can also be combined in or with abrasive agglomerates. Abrasive agglomerate particles typically comprise a plurality of abrasive particles, a binder, and optional additives. The binder may be organic and/or inorganic. Abrasive agglomerates may be randomly shape or have a predetermined shape associated with them. The shape may be a block, cylinder, pyramid, coin, square, or the like. Abrasive agglomerate particles typically have particle sizes ranging from about 100 to about 5000 micrometers, typically about 250 to about 2500 micrometers.

        "The abrasive particles may be uniformly distributed in the abrasive article or concentrated in selected areas or portions of the abrasive article. For example, in a coated abrasive, there may be two layers of abrasive particles. The first layer comprises abrasive particles other than abrasive particles made according to the present invention, and the second (outermost) layer comprises abrasive particles made according to the present invention. Likewise in a bonded abrasive, there may be two distinct sections of the grinding wheel. The outermost section may comprise abrasive particles made according to the present invention, whereas the innermost section does not. Alternatively, abrasive particles made according to the present invention may be uniformly distributed throughout the bonded abrasive article.",

        "The present invention provides a method of abrading a surface, the method comprising contacting at least one abrasive particle made according to the present invention, with a surface of a workpiece; and moving at least of one the abrasive particle or the contacted surface to abrade at least a portion of said surface with the abrasive particle. Methods for abrading with abrasive particles made according to the present invention range from snagging (i.e., high pressure high stock removal) to polishing (e.g., polishing medical implants with coated abrasive belts), wherein the latter is typically done with finer grades (e.g., ANSI 220 and finer) of abrasive particles. The abrasive particle may also be used in precision abrading applications, such as grinding cam shafts with vitrified bonded wheels. The size of the abrasive particles used for a particular abrading application will be apparent to those skilled in the art.",
        "Abrading with abrasive particles made according to the present invention may be done dry or wet. For wet abrading, the liquid may be introduced supplied in the form of a light mist to complete flood. Examples of commonly used liquids include: water, water-soluble oil, organic lubricant, and emulsions. The liquid may serve to reduce the heat associated with abrading and/or act as a lubricant. The liquid may contain minor amounts of additives such as bactericide, antifoaming agents, and the like.",

About 450 grams of alumina milling media (10 mm diameter; 99.9% alumina; obtained from Union Process, Akron, Ohio) were added to the bottle, and the mixture was milled for 4 hours to thoroughly mix the ingredients. After the milling, the milling media were removed and the slurry was poured onto a glass (\u201cPYREX\u201d) pan where it was dried using a heat-gun. After grinding with a mortar and pestle, some of the multiphase particles were fed into a hydrogen/oxygen torch flame. The hydrogen torch used to melt the multiphase particles, thereby generating a melted glass bead, was a Bethlehem bench burner, delivering hydrogen and oxygen at the following rates. For the inner ring, the hydrogen flow rate was 8 standard liters per minute (SLPM), the oxygen flow rate was 3 SLPM. For the outer ring, the hydrogen flow rate was 23 standard liters per minute (SLPM), the oxygen flow rate was 9.8 SLPM. The dried and sized particles were fed directly into the hydrogen torch flame, where they were melted and transported to an inclined stainless steel surface (about 20 inches wide with the slope angle of 45 degrees) with cold water running over (about 8 1/min.).",

The 1:1 mixture was homogenized for 10 minutes in an agate mortar under ethanol and allowed to dry. The mixture was then retrieved from the agate mortar and slurried onto aluminum sample holders with glass inserts using methyl ethyl ketone (MEK).",

The diffractometer was fitted with variable incident beam slits, fixed diffracted beam slits, and a graphite diffracted beam monochromator. The survey scans were conducted from 20 to 52 degrees (2\u03b8) using a 0.04 degree step size and 6 second dwell time. X-ray generator settings of 45 kV and 35 mA were employed.",
