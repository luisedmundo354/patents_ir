    "title": "Equalizer for a suspension system",
    "abstract": "An equalizer for a suspension system for a trailer is configured to absorb or dampen the harsh shocks or vibrations coming off of the leaf springs proximate to a center frame hangar, thus allowing for a \u201csofter\u201d ride. The equalizer utilizes two independent equalizer arm assemblies which are each rotatably secured within the equalizer. Each equalizer arm assembly is operatively associated with one of the front or rear leaf springs such that upon upward movement of either the front or rear leaf spring, the associated equalizer arm assembly is forced to rotate within the equalizer and to deform a shock absorber provided within the equalizer. The shock absorber, upon the deformation thereof, absorbs the harsh shocks or vibrations which would otherwise normally be transferred from the leaf springs, to the equalizer, and thus to the frame of the trailer.",

        "Briefly, and in accordance with the foregoing, the invention provides an equalizer for a suspension system for a trailer or the like which is configured to equalize the weight on both the front and rear axles of a trailer as tires of the trailer pass over uneven terrain, but which also is configured to dampen or absorb the harsh shocks or vibrations coming off of the rear end of a front leaf spring and the front end of a rear leaf spring proximate to a center frame hangar, thus allowing for a \u201csofter\u201d ride. The equalizer utilizes two independent equalizer arm assemblies which are each rotatably secured within the equalizer. Each equalizer arm assembly is operatively associated with one of the front or rear leaf springs such that upon upward movement of either the front or rear leaf spring, the associated equalizer arm assembly is forced to rotate within the equalizer and to deform a shock absorber provided within the equalizer. The shock absorber, upon the deformation thereof, absorbs the harsh shocks or vibrations which would otherwise normally be transferred from the leaf springs, to the equalizer, and thus to the frame of the trailer.",

        "Thus, the configuration of the equalizer 100 allows for two different connections to the center frame hangar 372 of the frame 374 of the trailer depending on the desired position of the equalizer 100 relative to the frame 374 of the trailer.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 2, the suspension system 102 includes the equalizer 100, a front leaf spring 394, a rear leaf spring 396, a front shackle or link 398 and a rear shackle or link 400. As discussed above, the equalizer 100 is rotatably secured or pivotally mounted to the center frame hangar 372 of the frame 374 of the trailer, illustrated at a point J in FIG. 2. A first end 402 of the front shackle 398 is rotatably secured or pivotally mounted to the first equalizer arm assembly 366, at a point K. The first end 402 of the front shackle 398 is rotatably secured or pivotally mounted to the first equalizer arm assembly 366 by a fastening member and a securing member. The fastening member extends through apertures of the front shackle 398 and the aperture 320a of the first upper pivot tube 119a.

The fastening members may be identical to or different from the fastening members 122a, 122b, 122c. The securing members may be identical to or different from the securing members 124a, 124b, 124c.",
        "A second end 406 of the front shackle 398 is rotatably secured or pivotally mounted to a rear end 408 of the front leaf spring 394 at a point M. A front end 410 of the front leaf spring 394 is attached to a front frame hangar 411 of the frame 374 at a point N, as illustrated in FIG. 2, or can be directly attached to the frame 374 itself, depending on the configuration of the frame 374.",
        "A second end 412 of the rear shackle 400 is rotatably secured or pivotally mounted to a front end 414 of the rear leaf spring 396 at a point P. A rear end 416 of the rear leaf spring 396 is attached to a rear frame hangar 417 of the frame 374 at a point Q, as illustrated in FIG. 2, or can be directly attached to the frame 374 itself, depending on the configuration of the frame 374.",
        "A front axle 418 of the trailer is positioned on the forward leaf spring 394 generally equidistantly between point M and point N. A rear axle 420 is positioned on the rear leaf spring 396 generally equidistantly between point P and point Q.",
        "It is to be understood that while only a single suspension system 102 is illustrated and described, it is typical to have one suspension system 102 provided on both a left and a right side of a trailer. If more than two axles are provided on the trailer, it is to be understood that two or more suspension systems 102 can be provided on both a left and a right side of the trailer.",
        "Like the prior art suspension system 20 including the equalizer 22 illustrated in FIG. 1, to the extent possible, road shock and vibrations from tires (not shown) of the trailer, utilizing the suspension system 102 including the equalizer 100 of the present invention, are transferred to the front and rear axles 418, 420, and are absorbed by the front and rear leaf springs 394, 396, respectively. Points J, N and Q are the contact points through which the road shock is passed to the frame 374. The equalizer 100 is included in the suspension system 102 in order to equalize the weight on both the front and rear axles 418, 420 as the tires pass over uneven terrain. For example, an upward motion of the front leaf spring 394 results in a downward motion of the rear leaf spring 396.",
        "As illustrated in FIGS. 37 and 38, the equalizer 100, unlike the equalizer 22 of the prior art, is configured to dampen or absorb the harsh shocks or vibrations coming off the rear end 408 of the front leaf spring 394 and the front end 414 of the rear leaf spring 396 proximate to the center frame hangar 372, thereby allowing for a \u201csofter\u201d ride.",
        "When the front leaf spring 394 moves upward, the equalizer 100 rotates upwardly and to the left relative to the center hangar 372 about point J, as illustrated in FIG. 37, such that the rear leaf spring 396 moves downward, thus equalizing the weight on both the front and rear axles 418, 420. Further, when the front leaf spring 394 moves upward, the first equalizer arm assembly 366 rotates or pivots upwardly between the first and second base plates 104a, 104b by the second fastening and securing members 122b, 124b about a point R. As the first equalizer arm assembly 366 rotates or pivots upwardly, the first lower shock plate 110a of the first equalizer arm assembly 366 is forced against a portion of the outer surface 117a of the first shock absorber 116a, thus forcing another portion of the outer surface 117a against the first upper shock plate 112a. Under this force, the first shock absorber 116a deforms between the first lower and upper shock plates 110a, 112a, such that the first ends 274a, 282a of the first lower and upper shock plates 110a, 112a move toward one another and, such that the second ends 276a, 284a of the first lower and upper shock plates 110a, 112a move toward one another. Upon deformation, the first shock absorber 116a absorbs or dampens the harsh shocks or vibrations coming off the rear end 408 of the front leaf spring 394, which would otherwise be transferred through the equalizer to the center frame hangar 372 and, thus, to the frame 374 of the trailer. Therefore, a \u201csofter\u201d ride is achieved by the suspension system 102 including the equalizer 100 of the present invention.",
        "Likewise, when the rear leaf spring 396 moves upward, the equalizer 100 rotates upwardly and to the right relative to the center hangar 372 about point J, as illustrated in FIG. 38, such that the front leaf spring 394 moves downward, thus equalizing the weight on both the front and rear axles 418, 420. Further, when the rear leaf spring 396 moves upward, the second equalizer arm assembly 368 rotates or pivots upwardly between the first and second base plates 104a, 104b by the third fastening and securing members 122c, 124c about a point S. As the second equalizer arm assembly 368 rotates or pivots upwardly, the second lower shock plate 110b of the second equalizer arm assembly 368 is forced against a portion of the outer surface 117b of the second shock absorber 116b, thus forcing another portion of the outer surface 117b against the second upper shock plate 112b. Under this force, the second shock absorber 116b deforms between the second lower and upper shock plates 110b, 112b, such that the first ends 274b, 282b of the second lower and upper shock plates 110b, 112b move toward one another and, such that the second ends 276b, 284b of the second lower and upper shock plates 110b, 112b move toward one another. Upon deformnation, the second shock absorber 116b absorbs or dampens the harsh shocks or vibrations coming off the front end 414 of the rear leaf spring 396, which would otherwise be transferred through the equalizer to the center frame hangar 372 and, thus, to the frame 374 of the trailer. Therefore, a \u201csofter\u201d ride is achieved by the suspension system 102 including the equalizer 100 of the present invention.",
        "The equalizer 100 and the suspension system 102 which includes the equalizer 100 is advantageous and beneficial for a \u201csofter\u201d ride in comparison to the prior art equalizer 22 and the prior art suspension system 100 which includes the prior art equalizer 22.",
        "While a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown and described, it is envisioned that those skilled in the art may devise various modifications without departing from the spirit and scope of the foregoing description and the appended claims."
