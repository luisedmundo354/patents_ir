        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a printed circuit board (PCB) for high frequency on which high frequency circuit elements of a GHz band are mounted and more particularly to a PCB capable of transmitting a signal with a low power consumption.",
        "This application claims priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-058947, filed on Mar. 3, 2004 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-007887, filed on Jan. 14, 2005, the entireties of which are incorporated by reference herein.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "In recent years, according to a request for an information process at high speed and an information communication with high density at high speed, the frequency of a signal for operating a high frequency semiconductor element has been remarkably increased. For instance, an LSI chip currently used for a CPU of a computer operates under the clock frequency of several GHz. Further, in a satellite broadcasting a future expansion of which is greatly anticipated or a mobile communication such as a mobile phone, a mobile terminal or the like, a high frequency signal of a GHz band is used.",
        "In a high frequency circuit, a loss is generated in a conductor and a PCB. Especially, the loss in the PCB has been serious. These losses appear as problems such as a heat generation, noise, high consumed electric power when transmitting a signal. That is, the material of the PCB used for elements in a high frequency band is desirably the material which has a property of low loss for the high frequency signal.",
        "When the PCB tracks with characteristic impedance Zo (\u03a9) is driven under voltage V (V), a transmission loss P (W) is expressed by a following formula (1). This formula shows that the increase of Zo is effective for decrease of P under the condition of constant V.\n\nP=V2/Zo\u2003\u2003(1)",
        "The characteristic impedance Zo is proportional to a square root of a ratio of the relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr of the material of the PCB to the relative dielectric constant \u2208r as shown by a following formula (2).\n\nZo=(L/C)1/2\u221d(\u03bcr/\u2208r)1/2\u2003\u2003(2)\n\n(Here, L represents an inductance per unit length of PCB track and C represents an electric capacity per unit length).",
        "As the PCB with the low loss showing the high characteristic impedance Zo, the PCB using a material of low dielectric constant has been hitherto proposed (for instance, see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. hei 6-53357). In this PCB, the characteristic impedance Zo can be increased by decreasing the relative dielectric constant \u2208r of the PCB, so that the loss can be decreased.",
        "As the material of the low dielectric constant, a fluororesin such as polytetrafluoro ethylene (the relative dielectric constant \u2208r is about 2.1). When the porous density of the above-described fluororesin is increased, a lower dielectric constant can be achieved. For instance, in a porous polytetrafluoro ethylene resin having holes as many as 80%, the relative dielectric constant \u2208r is about 1.1.",
        "However, the PCB formed with the porous fluororesin is extremely low in its mechanical strength and has low stability for thermal. Accordingly, the above-described PCB has been hardly available for practical use.",
        "Further, since there does not exist the material whose relative dielectric constant \u2208r is smaller than 1, there has been a limitation in a method for reducing the loss of the conventional PCB.",
        "The present invention was devised by taking the above-described problems of the related art into consideration and it is an object of the present invention to provide a PCB that can transmit a high frequency signal of a GHz band can be transmitted with low loss.",
        "The inventors of the present invention newly noticed magnetic characteristics as well as the dielectric characteristics of the PCB. Specifically, they eagerly studied to reduce the loss not only by decreasing the dielectric constant (\u2208r), but also increasing the magnetic permeability (\u03bcr) at the same time. Thus, they reached the achievement of the present invention.",
        "The invention proposed to solve the above-described problems relates to a PCB comprising an insulator and magnetic nanoparticles dispersed in the insulator.",
        "Here, the magnetic nanoparticles preferably exhibits superparamagnetism.",
        "The magnetic nanoparticles are preferably superparamagnetic nanoparticles with blocking temperature at 80\u00b0 C. or lower.",
        "The volume filling rate of the magnetic nanoparticles is not higher than 60%.",
        "The magnetic nanoparticles are preferably made of a material selected from a group including elements Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Sm, Nd, Th, Al, Pd and Pt, intermetallic compounds of the elements, binary alloys of the elements, ternary alloys of the elements, or the elements, the intermetallic compounds, the binary alloys, the ternary alloys including, as additional elements, at least one of Si, N, Mo, V, W, Ti, B, C and P, Fe oxides, Fe oxides further including at least one of the elements except Fe, Mn\u2014Zn ferrites, Ni\u2014Zn ferrites, Mg\u2014Zn ferrites, Mg\u2014Mn ferrites and garnet.",
        "Further, the magnetic nanoparticles are desirably liquid-phase synthesized.",
        "The insulator is preferably made of a polymer material, ceramic, glass or a composite material of them.",
        "The insulator is preferably made of polytetrafluoro ethylene, tetrafluoro ethylene-hexafluoro ethylene copolymer, tetrafluoro ethylene-hexafluoro propylene copolymer, tetrafluoro ethylene-perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether copolymer, polyvinyl fluoride, polyvinylidene fluoride, polymethyl pentene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutadiene, polyamide imide, polyether sulfone, polyether ether ketone, polystyrene, polyester, polycarbonate, polyimide, polyphenylene oxide, an epoxy resin or a cyanate resin.",
        "Further, the insulator is preferably made of alumina ceramic, aluminum nitride ceramic, silicon nitride ceramic, boron nitride ceramic or a composite material of them.",
        "Still further, the insulator is preferably made of silica glass, silicon mica glass, crystal glass, quartz glass, borosilicate glass or a composite material of them.",
        "According to the present invention, the PCB can have a high relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr and a low relative dielectric constant \u2208r and exhibit a desired low transmission loss even in a GHz band.",

        "FIG. 6 is a diagram showing the temperature dependence of the relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr of a PCB of Example 3.",
        "Now, an embodiment of a PCB according to the present invention will be described below.",
        "FIG. 1 shows a sectional view of the PCB according to the present invention.",
        "The PCB 10 includes an insulator 12 and magnetic nanoparticles dispersed in the insulator 12.",
        "The magnetic nanoparticles 11 are fine magnetic particles having the particle size of nano order, have blocking temperature Tb and preferably exhibit superparamagnetism. Especially, the magnetic nanoparticles 11 are preferably superparamagnetic nanoparticles having the blocking temperature Tb at 80\u00b0 C. or lower. The blocking temperature Tb is set to 80\u00b0 C. or lower to ensure a high relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr within the range of temperature of \u221210 to 80\u00b0 C. as using temperature of the PCB.",
        "Now, the blocking temperature Tb will be briefly described below.",
        "In the spontaneous magnetization of the fine magnetic particles, an orientation is maintained by the magnetic anisotropic energy E of the fine particles. Here, the magnetic anisotropic energy E is expressed by the product of the magnetic anisotropic constant K and the volume V of the fine magnetic particles as shown by a following formula. The orientation of the spontaneous magnetization may be possibly changed by heat energy kBT. Here, kB represents Boltzmann constant and T represents absolute temperature.\n\nE=K\u00b7V",
        "When environmental temperature rises and the heat energy kBT is substantially the same as the magnetic anisotropic energy E or higher than the magnetic anisotropic energy, the direction of the spontaneous magnetization is continuously thermally activated and vibrated so that residual magnetization disappears. On the other hand, with the fall of temperature, when the heat energy kBT is adequately lower than the magnetic anisotropic energy E, the vibration in the spontaneous magnetizing direction is suppressed and the residual magnetization begins to appear. The blocking temperature Tb means the temperature at which the residual magnetization begins to appear.",
        "Further, the magnetic nanoparticles 11 are desirably made of a material selected from a group including elements Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Sm, Nd, Tb, Al, Pd and Pt, intermetallic compounds of the elements, binary alloys of the elements, ternary alloys of the elements, or the elements, the intermetallic compounds, the binary alloys, the ternary alloys including, as additional elements, at least one of Si, N, Mo, V, W, Ti, B, C and P, Fe oxides, Fe oxides further including at least one of the elements except Fe, Mn\u2014Zn ferrites, Ni\u2014Zn ferrites, Mg\u2014Zn ferrites, Mg\u2014Mn ferrites and garnet.",
        "As the magnetic nanoparticles 11, there are magnetic nanoparticles that are gas-phase synthesized or liquid-phase synthesized. The magnetic nanoparticles that are liquid-phase synthesized are preferable.",
        "A liquid-phase synthesizing method is a method in which metallic salt or organic metal is dissolved in liquid to separate particles by a reducing process or a decomposing process. As well-known liquid-phase synthesizing methods, a coprecipitation method, a reducing method by alcohol, a thermal decomposition method of organic metal compound, a reversed micelle method, an ultrasonic method and a reducing method by electride may be exemplified. Ordinarily, the magnetic nanoparticles 11 that are liquid-phase synthesized are obtained as dispersion solution in which the surfaces of the magnetic nanoparticles are coated with an organic stabilizer.",
        "Further, according to the liquid-phase synthesizing method, a particle diameter can be controlled by selecting synthesizing conditions. Still further, a particle size distribution can be also controlled by a size selective deposition method after the synthesis. The size selective deposition method is a method that a flocculant is dripped on the dispersion solution of the magnetic nanoparticles to selectively precipitate the particles having large diameter. As the flocculent, a solvent is selected that can be mixed with a solvent of the dispersion solution of the magnetic nanoparticles and has a different solubility of the organic stabilizer.",
        "The magnetic nanoparticles 11 have different values of magnetic anisotropic constants K depending on the kinds of magnetic materials. For instance, in the case of Co, K is expressed by K=4.5\u00d7105 J/m3. In the case of Fe, K is expressed by K=4.7\u00d7104 J/m3. In the case of FePt, K is expressed by K=6.6\u00d7106 J/m3. In the case of Fe3O4, K is expressed by K=8.7\u00d7103 \u03bcm3.",
        "Accordingly, an optimum particle size is suitably determined depending on the kind of the magnetic material. For instance, the average particle size of Co nanoparticles is preferably 8 nm or smaller. The average particle size of Fe nanoparticles is preferably 25 nm or smaller. The average particle size of FePt nanoparticles is preferably 4 nm or smaller. The average particle size of Fe3O4 nanoparticles is preferably 30 nm or smaller.",
        "Further, in the magnetic nanoparticles 11 used in the present invention, the standard deviation of the particle size distribution is not higher than 30% as large as the average particle size, preferably not higher than 20% and more preferably not higher than 10%. As the standard deviation becomes smaller, the distribution of the blocking temperature Tb becomes narrower and a higher relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr is exhibited. On the other hand, when the standard deviation is higher than 30% as large as the average particle size, since the distribution of the blocking temperature Tb is too wide, the relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr is decreased. For instance, within the range of temperature of \u221210 to 80\u00b0 C., the relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr is smaller than 10.",
        "The insulator 12 is made of a polymer material, ceramic, glass or a composite material of them.",
        "The polymer material includes polytetrafluoro ethylene, tetrafluoro ethylene-hexafluoro ethylene copolymer, tetrafluoro ethylene-hexafluoro propylene copolymer, tetrafluoro ethylene-perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether copolymer, polyvinyl fluoride, polyvinylidene fluoride, polymethyl pentene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutadiene, polyamide imide, polyether sulfone, polyether ether ketone, polystyrene, polyester, polycarbonate, polyimide, polyphenylene oxide, an epoxy resin or a cyanate resin.",
        "The ceramic includes the alumina ceramic, the aluminum nitride ceramic, the silicon nitride ceramic and the boron nitride ceramic. Furthermore, the ceramic may be made of a composite material of these ceramics.",
        "The glass includes silica glass, silicon mica glass, crystal glass, quartz glass and borosilicate glass. Furthermore, the glass may be made of a composite material of these glasses.",
        "The volume filling rate of the magnetic nanoparticles 11 dispersed in the insulator 12 is preferably 60% or lower. When the filling rate of the magnetic nanoparticles 11 exceeds 60%, the mechanical strength of the PCB 10 is lowered and the PCB is easily apt to be deformed. Accordingly, the PCB 10 is caused to be distorted during the producing step of the PCB 10. Thus, a positioning operation is difficult when a semiconductor device is produced by using the PCB 10. As a result, the connection to the device is undesirably failed. Further, the volume filling rate of the magnetic nanoparticles 11 dispersed in the insulator 12 is preferably 5% or higher. When the volume filling rate of the magnetic nanoparticles 11 is not lower than 5%, the PCB 10 does not show an adequate relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr.",
        "In the above-described structure, the PCB 10 has a high relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr and a low relative dielectric constant \u2208r and can transmit a signal with a low loss in a high frequency area of a GHz band.",
        "Now, a principle that the PCB 10 of the present invention has magnetic characteristics and dielectric characteristics that are compatible with each other will be described below.",
        "(1) With Respect to relative Magnetic Permeability \u03bcr",
        "The magnetic nanoparticles 11 contribute to the relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr of the PCB 10.",
        "The temperature dependence of the relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr of the PCB is expressed by a following formula (3). Here, \u03c7r represents a relative magnetic susceptibility of the PCB. Ms represents the saturation magnetization of the magnetic nanoparticles. Vave represents the average volume of the particles. x represents the volume filling rate of particles in the PCB. KB represents a Boltzmann constant. \u03bc0 represents a magnetic permeability in a vacuum.\n\n\u03bcr(T)=\u03c7r(T)+1=(Ms2 Vavex)/(3KBT\u03bc0)+1\u2003\u2003(3)",
        "FIG. 2 shows the relation between the relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr of Co nanoparticles (particle size of 7 nm) and temperature T on the basis of the formula (3). It is apparent from the drawing that the relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr is 10 or higher within the range of temperature of \u221210 to 80\u00b0 C.",
        "Here, the blocking temperature Tb is proportional to the product of the magnetic anisotropic constant K and the volume V of the magnetic materials as described in a following formula (4). That is, this means that the blocking temperature Tb depends on the kinds of the magnetic materials and the particle size thereof.\n\nTb\u221dK\u00b7V\u2003\u2003(4)",
        "Suitable kinds of magnetic materials, suitable particle size and a suitable particle size distribution are respectively selected for the magnetic nanoparticles 11 used in the PCB of the present invention. Thus, the blocking temperature Tb can be adjusted. Accordingly, the relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr can be controlled to a desired value.",
        "For instance, when the blocking temperature Tb is set to be distributed at 80\u00b0 C. or lower, the relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr in the PCB of the present invention can be set to 10 or higher within the range of temperature of \u221210 to 80\u00b0 C.",
        "Now, there is a fear that the relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr is lower than 10 due to a hysteresis loss and an eddy current loss in the high frequency area of the GHz band. However, groups of magnetic nanoparticles used in the present invention are distributed in the range where the blocking temperature Tb is located at 80\u00b0 C. or lower and do not show the hysteresis loss. Further, since the PCB has a structure that the below-described groups of fine particles not larger than skin depth are dispersed in the insulator, the specific resistance of the PCB is sufficiently high and the PCB does not exhibit the eddy current loss.",
        "When a frequency is increased, the fine magnetic particles generate a natural resonance under a certain frequency and the magnetic permeability is abruptly decreased. Therefore, to maintain a satisfactory transmission loss in the PCB of the present invention, the PCB needs to be used in a frequency band except a natural resonance frequency.",
        "Here, a frequency f under which the fine magnetic particles generate the natural resonance is proportional to an anisotropic magnetic field Hk of the fine magnetic particles as described by a following formula.\n\nf\u221dHk",
        "For instance, in the case of the Co nanoparticles (Hk=5.1\u00d7105 A/m), f is approximately 20 GHz. In the case of the Fe nanoparticles (Hk=4.4\u00d7104 A/m), f is approximately 2 GHz. In the case of the FePt nanoparticles (Hk=9.2\u00d7106 A/m), f is approximately 300 GHz. In the case of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Hk=2.7\u00d7104 A/m), f is approximately 1 GHz.",
        "From the above-described facts, the magnetic nanoparticles have a high relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr.",
        "(2) With Respect to Relative Dielectric Constant \u2208r",
        "Both the insulator 12 and the magnetic nanoparticles 11 contribute to the relative dielectric constant \u2208r of the PCB 10.",
        "For the insulator 12, the material showing the low relative dielectric constant \u2208r and the low dielectric loss is employed as described above. For instance, polytetrafluoro ethylene has the relative dielectric constant \u2208r of 2.1 and dielectric loss tangent of 1\u00d710\u22124 (measurement under 1 MHz).",
        "The dielectric characteristics when the insulator 12 is filled with the magnetic nanoparticles 11 are different from those when the insulator 12 is not filled with the magnetic nanoparticles 11. However, when the volume filling rate of the magnetic nanoparticles 11 is not higher than 60%, the dielectric characteristics, necessary for the PCB 10, for instance, the relative dielectric constant \u2208r can be maintained to 5 or smaller.",
        "As described above, the PCB of the present invention can have not only the high relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr, but also the low relative dielectric constant \u2208r and can exhibit the satisfactory low transmission loss even in the GHz band.",
        "Now, a method for producing the PCB according to the present invention will be described below.",
        "The PCB according to the present invention may be preferably produced in accordance with a below-described procedure.\n\n    (s11) The magnetic nanoparticles are dispersed in a solvent.\n    (s12) The material of the insulator is mixed in the dispersion solution.\n    (s13) While the solution is agitated, the solvent is evaporated to obtain a black residual solid material.\n    (s14) The residual solid material is compression-molded to obtain the PCB.",
        "The liquid-phase synthesized magnetic nanoparticles are obtained as the dispersion solution in which the surfaces of the magnetic nanoparticles are coated with the organic stabilizer. Accordingly, the step s11 may be omitted and the dispersion solution can be directly used as the dispersion solution in the step s12.",
        "Further, the insulator used herein may be made of any of the polymer material, the ceramic, the glass or the composite material of them. A process of mixing the material of the insulator in the dispersion solution in the step s12 may be carried out by a method for dissolving the polymer material in a solvent.",
        "The PCB according to the present invention may be produced by another procedure as described below.\n\n    (s21) The surfaces of the magnetic nanoparticles are coated with an insulator material component and the obtained magnetic nanoparticles are dispersed in a solvent.\n    (s22) While the solution is agitated, the solvent is evaporated to obtain a black residual solid material.\n    (s23) The residual solid material is compression-molded, and heated and sintered to obtain the PCB.",
        "The material of the insulator used herein is preferably made of the ceramic or the glass. A process for coating the surfaces of the magnetic nanoparticles with the insulator material component in the step s21 may be carried out by a sol-gel method.",
        "In accordance with any of the above-described producing methods, the PCB having the structure shown in FIG. 1 can be obtained.",
        "The PCB of the present invention can be used as a strip line, a microstrip line or a board for other circuits.",
        "Now, the present invention will be described below in more detail by way of Examples. The present invention is not limited to the Examples.",

Accordingly, it was recognized from the formula (1) that the PCB of the Example 1 could transmit a signal with a lower loss.",
        "The relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr of the PCB of the Example 1 had a dependence on temperature and exhibited different values depending on temperature as shown in FIG. 3.",
        "To suppress the temperature dependence of the relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr, a plurality of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles having different particle sizes and different particle size distributions may be mixed together at the suitable ratio. The board using the mixture of the magnetic particles as the magnetic nanoparticles can suppress the change of the relative magnetic permeability \u03bcr due to temperature within an arbitrary range of temperature.",
