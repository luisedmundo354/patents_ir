    "abstract": "The image quality of a display device using a bottom gate TFT is improved. In particular, fluctuation in luminance is controlled and the frequency characteristic of a driver circuit is compensated by suppressing a change in amount of current flowing through an EL element which is caused by a change in surrounding temperature while the device is in use. A monitoring EL element is provided in addition to a pixel portion EL element. The monitoring EL element constitutes a temperature compensation circuit together with a buffer amplifier and the like. A current is supplied to the pixel portion EL element through the temperature compensation circuit. This makes it possible to keep the amount of current flowing through the pixel portion EL element constant against a change in temperature, and to control the fluctuation in luminance. An input signal is subjected to time base expansion to perform sampling with accuracy.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an electronic display device fabricated by forming EL (electroluminescence) elements on a substrate, specifically, to an EL display device using a semiconductor element (an element formed from a semiconductor thin film). The invention also relates to electronic equipment employing the EL display device as a display unit.",
        "The EL element herein includes both an element that utilizes light emission from a singlet exciton (fluorescence) and an element that utilizes light emission from a triplet exciton (phosphorescence).",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Development of EL display devices having an EL element as a self-luminous element is flourishing in recent years. The EL display devices are also called organic EL displays (OELDS) or organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).",
        "The EL display devices are self-luminous unlike liquid crystal display devices. The EL element is structured such that an EL layer is sandwiched between a pair of electrodes (an anode and a cathode). The EL layer usually has a laminate structure. Typical example thereof is a laminate structure consisting of a hole transportation layer, a light emitting layer and an electron transportation layer which has been proposed by Tang, et al. of Eastman Kodak Company. This structure is very high in light emission efficiency, and is employed by almost all of EL display devices currently under development.",
        "Other examples of the structure of the EL layer include a laminate structure consisting of an anode, a hole injection layer, a hole transportation layer, a light emitting layer and an electron transportation layer which are layered in this order, and a laminate structure consisting of an anode, a hole injection layer, a hole transportation layer, a light emitting layer, an electron transportation layer and an electron injection layer which are layered in this order. The light emitting layer may be doped with a fluorescent pigment or the like.",
        "In this specification, all layers that are formed between an anode and a cathode are collectively called an EL layer. Therefore the EL layer includes all of the above hole injection layer, hole transportation layer, light, emitting layer, electron transportation layer and electron injection layer.",
        "A pair of electrodes (a cathode and an anode) applies a given voltage to the EL layer structured as above, whereby carrier recombination takes place in the light emitting layer to cause the layer to emit light. The voltage applied between two electrodes (an anode and a cathode) of an EL element is herein referred to as EL driving voltage. An EL element emitting light is herein expressed as an EL element being driven. A light emitting element composed of an anode, an EL layer and a cathode herein will be referred to as EL element.",
        "FIG. 4 is a block diagram showing a multi-gray scale EL display device. The display device shown here is of the type that obtains gray scale by inputting a digital signal into a source signal line driving circuit and uses a digital gray scale method. Particularly the case of using time division gray scale method for varying the luminance by controlling the period of time during which a pixel emits light will be described.",
        "The EL display device of FIG. 4 has a pixel portion 101 and a source signal line driving circuit 102 and a gate signal line driving circuit 103 which are arranged in the periphery of the pixel portion 101. The pixel portion and the driving circuits are composed of thin film transistors (hereinafter referred to as TFTs) formed on a substrate. An external switch 116 for controlling the EL driving voltage is connected to the pixel portion 101.",
        "The source signal line driving circuit 102 includes, basically a shift register 102a, a latch (A) 102b and a latch (B) 102c. The shift register 102a receives input of a clock signal (CLK) and a start pulse (SP). The latch (A) 102b receives input of digital data signals (denoted by VD in FIG. 4) whereas the latch (B) 102c receives input of latch signals (denoted by S_LAT in FIG. 4).",
        "The digital data signals VD to be inputted to the pixel portion 101 are generated in a time division gray scale data signal generating circuit 114. This circuit converts video signals that are analog signals or digital signals containing image information into the digital data signals VD for time division gray scale. The circuit 114 also generates a timing pulse or the like that is necessary for time division gray scale display.",
        "Typically, the time division gray scale data signal generating circuit 114 includes means for dividing one frame period into a plurality of sub-frame periods in accordance with n bit gray scale (n is an integer of 2 or greater), means for selecting either a writing period or a display period in each of the plural sub-frame periods, and means for setting the length of the display period.",
        "The pixel portion 101 is structured generally as shown in FIG. 5. In FIG. 5, the pixel portion 101 is provided with gate signal lines (G1 to Gy) to which a selecting signal is inputted and source signal lines (also called data signal lines) (S1 to Sx) to which a digital data signal is inputted. The digital data signal refers to a digital video signal.",
        "The pixel portion also has power supply lines (V1 to Vx) parallel to the source signal lines (S1 to Sx). The electric potential of the power supply lines (V1 to Vx) is called a power supply electric potential. Wirings (Vb1 to Vby) are provided in parallel with the gate signal lines (G1 to Gy). The wirings (Vb1 to Vby) are connected to the external switch 116.",
        "A plurality of pixels 104 are arranged in matrix in the pixel portion 101. One of the pixels 104 is enlarged and shown in FIG. 6. In FIG. 6, reference symbol 1701 denotes a TFT functioning as a switching element (hereinafter referred to as switching TFT). 1702 denotes a TFT functioning as an element for controlling a current supplied to an EL element 1703 (current controlling element) (The TFT will be called a driving TFT). Designated by 1704 is a capacitor storage.",
        "The switching TFT 1701 has a gate electrode connected to a gate signal line 1705 that is one of the gate signal lines (G1 to Gy) to which a gate signal is inputted. The switching TFT 1701 has a source region and a drain region one of which is connected to a source signal line 1706 and the other of which is connected to a gate electrode of the driving TFT 1702 and to the capacitor storage 1704. The source signal line 1706 is one of the source signal lines. (S1 to Sx) to which a digital data signal is inputted.",
        "The driving TFT 1702 has a source region and a drain region one of which is connected to a power supply line 1707 and the other of which is connected to the EL element 1703. The power supply line 1707 is one of the power supply lines (V1 to Vx). The capacitor storage 1704 is connected to the power supply line 1707 that is one of the power supply lines (V1 to Vx).",
        "The EL element 1703 is composed of an anode, a cathode, and an EL layer interposed between the anode and the cathode. When the anode is connected to the source region or the drain region of the driving TFT 1702, the anode serves as a pixel electrode whereas the cathode serves as an opposite electrode. On the other hand, when the cathode is connected to the source region or the drain region of the driving TFT 1702, the cathode serves as the pixel electrode whereas the anode serves as the opposite electrode. The electric potential of the opposite electrode is herein called an opposite electric potential. The difference in electric potential between the opposite electrode and the pixel electrode generates the EL driving voltage, which is applied to the EL layer.",
        "The opposite electrode of the EL element 1703 is connected to the external switch 116 through one of the wirings (Vb1 to Vby). (See FIG. 5.) Next, driving the multi-gray scale EL display device in accordance with the time division gray scale method will be described. The description given here takes as an example the case where n bit digital video signals are inputted to obtain display in 2n gray scales.",
        "FIG. 7 shows a timing chart thereof.",
        "First, one frame period is divided into n sub-frame periods (SF1 to SFn).",
        "A period during which one image is displayed using all of the pixels in the pixel portion is defined as one frame period (F). Here, one frame period is set to about 1/60 second. With the period set to this long, human eyes do not recognize flicker in animated images displayed.",
        "As the number of gray scales is increased, the number of sub-frame periods in one frame period also increases and the driving circuits (the source signal line driving circuit and the gate signal line driving circuit), the source signal line driving circuit in particular, has to be driven at a higher frequency.",
        "Each sub-frame period is divided into a wiring period (Ta) and a display period (Ts). The writing period is a period for inputting signals into all of the pixels in one sub-frame period. The display period (also called a lights-on period) is a period for choosing whether or not the EL element emits light so that an image is displayed.",
        "The EL driving voltage shown in FIG. 7 corresponds to the EL driving voltage of the EL element when the EL element is caused to emit light. To elaborate, the EL driving voltage of the EL element in the pixel which is designated to emit light is in the level that does not cause the EL element to emit light, e.g., 0 V, during the writing period. During the display period, on the other hand, the EL driving voltage thereof is in the level that allows the EL element to emit light.",
        "The opposite electric potential is controlled by the external switch 116 shown in FIGS. 4 and 5. During the writing period, the opposite electric potential is kept at the same level as the power supply electric potential. On the other hand, the opposite electric potential is changed in the display period so as to generate an electric potential difference between the opposite electric potential and the power supply electric potential which causes the EL element to emit light.",
        "Detailed descriptions will be given first on the writing period and the display period of the respective sub-frame periods using the reference symbols in FIGS. 5 and 6. Then time division gray scale display will be described.",
        "First, a gate signal is inputted to the gate signal line G1 to turn every switching TFT 1701 connected to the gate signal line G1 ON.",
        "In this specification, a TFT being turned ON means that the gate voltage of the TFT is changed to make the source-drain thereof conductive.",
        "Then the writing period is started and digital data signals are inputted to the source signal lines (S1 to Sx). At this point the opposite electric potential is kept at the same level as the power supply electric potential of the power supply lines (V1 to Vx). The digital data signals contain information of \u20180\u2019 or \u20181\u2019. The digital data signals of \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 are signals having Hi voltage and Lo voltage, respectively.",
        "The digital data signals inputted to the source signal lines (S1 to Sx) are inputted to the gate electrode of each driving TFT 1702 through each switching TFT 1701 that has been turned ON. The capacitor storage 1704 also receives input of a digital data signal to hold it in.",
        "Selecting signals are successively inputted to the gate signal lines G2 to Gy to repeat the above operation until all of the pixels receive input of the digital data signals and the inputted digital data signals are held in the respective pixels. A period it takes for the digital data signals to be inputted to all of the pixels in each sub-frame period is the writing period.",
        "After inputting the digital data signals to all of the pixels, every switching TFT 1701 is turned OFF.",
        "A TFT being turned OFF means that the gate voltage of the TFT is changed to make the source-drain thereof unconductive.",
        "Thereafter, the external switch 116 connected to the opposite electrode is used to change the electric potential difference between the opposite electric potential and the power supply electric potential to a degree that causes the EL element to emit light.",
        "When a digital data signal has information of \u20180\u2019, the driving TFT 1702 is turned OFF and the EL element 1703 does not emit light. When a digital data signal has information of \u20181\u2019 on the other hand, the driving TFT 1702 is turned ON. Then the pixel electrode of the EL element 1703 is kept at the power supply electric potential and the EL element 1703 emits light. In this way, information contained in a digital data signal determines whether the EL element emits light or not. Every pixel whose EL element is designated to emit light is simultaneously lit up, and the lit-up pixels together form an image. A period during which the display by the pixels lasts is the display period.",
        "The writing periods (Ta1 to Tan) in the n sub-frame periods (SF1 to SFn) have the same length. The sub-frame periods SF1 to SFn have display periods Ts1 to Tsn, respectively.",
        "For instance, the length of the display periods may be set so as to satisfy the relation Ts1:Ts2:Ts3: . . . :Ts(n\u22121):Tsn=20:2\u22121:2\u22122: . . . :2\u2212(n\u22122):2\u2212(n\u22121). Display of desired gray scales within the range of 2n gray scales can be obtained through combinations of the display periods.",
        "Here, given pixels are lit up for the period Tsn.",
        "Then, a writing period is started again so that all the pixels receive digital data signals to start the display period. Subsequently, one of the display periods Ts1 to Ts(n\u22121) is started. Here, given pixels are lit up for the period Ts(n\u22121).",
        "The same operation is repeated for the remaining (n\u22122) sub-frame periods, so that the display periods Ts(n\u22122), Ts(n\u22123), and Ts1 are sequentially set and given pixels are lit up during each of the sub-frame periods.",
        "One frame period is completed when n sub-frame periods have come and gone. The cumulative length of the display periods during which a pixel is lit up determines the gray scale of the pixel.",
        "For example, the luminance is 100% when n=8 and the pixel in question emits light in all display periods. When the pixel emits light only in the display periods Ts1 and Ts2, the luminance is 75%. If the pixel is designated to emit light during the display periods Ts3, Ts5 and Ts8, the luminance may be 16%.",
        "An object of the present invention is to improve the image quality of an EL display device, in particular, an EL display device using a bottom gate TFT. The object will be detailed below.",
        "When the time division gray scale method described above is employed, the amount of current flowing into an EL element in a pixel is desirably kept constant throughout the display period of each sub-frame period. In actuality, however, the amount of current varies depending on the temperature.",
        "FIG. 18 is a graph showing the temperature characteristic of the EL element. The axis of abscissa shows the applied voltage that is applied between two electrodes of the EL element. The axis of ordinate shows the amount of current flowing into the EL element.",
        "One can tell from this graph how much current flows into the EL element when a voltage is applied between the electrodes of the EL element at a certain temperature. Temperature T1 is higher than temperature T2, which is higher than temperature T3.",
        "The graph shows that the same level of voltage applied between the electrodes of the EL element in the pixel portion does not always cause the same amount of current to flow through the EL element; the amount of current flowing into the EL element may increase as the temperature of the EL layer rises, depending on the temperature characteristic of the EL element.",
        "Thus the amount of current flowing through the EL element in the pixel portion varies depending on the temperature at which the EL display device is used (hereinafter referred to as surrounding temperature), whereby the luminance of the EL element in the pixel portion is changed. Therefore the accuracy in gray scale display cannot be maintained, contributing to impaired reliability of EL display devices.",
        "Furthermore, current consumption is increased when the amount of current flowing through the EL element is increased.",
        "Another object of the present invention is to control those change in luminance and increase in power consumption of the EL element due to a change in surrounding temperature.",
        "Moreover, bottom gate TFTs have the following two problems.",
        "Problem one is as follows.",
        "In bottom gate TFTs, side walls of a gate electrode has to be gentle because, according to the manufacturing process, an insulating film and a semiconductor thin film are to be formed thereon. Therefore, the width of the gate electrode (gate length) in bottom gate TFTs cannot be as small as the width of a gate electrode (gate length) in top gate TFTs, where side walls of the gate electrode are not required to be so gentle.",
        "Problem Two is as follows.",
        "In bottom gate TFTs, a gate electrode is formed under a semiconductor thin film that is to be used as a source region and a drain region and hence the semiconductor thin film is convexed. If a polycrystalline film such as a polysilicon film is used as the convex semiconductor thin film, the crystallinity of the film is inferior to that of a polycrystalline film formed on a flat surface, and characteristics such as an electric field effect mobility (mobility) are also poor.",
        "Because of these problems, the frequency characteristic of a driver circuit composed of a bottom gate TFT is inferior to the frequency characteristic of a driver circuit composed of a top gate TFT.",
        "In a display device that has a large display screen as well as a large number of pixels satisfying the VGA standard or higher, there are needed many source signal lines and high-speed operation. High-speed operation is also necessary in the case that the time division gray scale method described above is employed and a plurality of sub-frame periods are provided. Accordingly, the operation speed is insufficient especially in a source signal line driving circuit that uses a bottom gate TFT.",
        "To sum up the objects of the present invention, the invention aims at providing a display device which is capable of controlling the change in luminance and increase in current consumption of an EL element due to a change in surrounding temperature, and which can obtain a larger screen, higher definition and more gray scales despite the inferior frequency characteristic of a source signal line driving circuit that is composed of a bottom gate TFT.",
        "In order to attain the above objects, an EL element for monitoring the temperature (hereinafter referred to as monitoring EL element) is provided in an EL display device. One electrode of the temperature monitoring EL element is connected to a constant current generator. The temperature characteristic of the monitoring EL element is utilized to keep the amount of current flowing into an EL element of a pixel constant. Furthermore, a video signal is subjected to time base expansion so as to give margin to sampling of the video signal in a source signal line driving circuit.",
        "Hereinafter, structures of the present invention are described.",
        "According to the present invention, there is provided a display device comprising a plurality of EL elements of a plurality of pixels and a monitoring EL element, characterized in that the temperature characteristic of the monitoring EL element is used to reduce a change in amount of current flowing through the plural EL elements due to temperature change.",

        "Reference symbol 502 denotes a buffer amplifier, 503., a monitoring EL element, and 504, a constant current generator. One electrode of the monitoring EL element 503 is connected to the constant current generator 504, so that a constant amount of current flows through the monitoring EL element 503. When the temperature of an EL layer of the EL element changes, the amount of current flowing into the monitoring EL element 503 does not change but instead the electric potential of the electrode of the monitoring EL element 503 which is connected to the constant current generator 504 changes.",
        "The monitoring EL element 503 and an EL element in each pixel are manufactured such that the relation of the amount of current flowing into the element to the level of voltage applied between two electrodes of the element is the same for both the monitoring EL element 503 and the pixel EL element at the same temperature.",
        "Here, an electrode of the pixel EL element (pixel electrode) which is connected to the power supply line 501 is an anode if an electrode of the monitoring EL element 503 which is connected to the buffer amplifier 502 is an anode.

One of the input terminals is a non-inversion input terminal (+) and the other is an inversion input terminal (\u2212). The electric potential of one electrode of the monitoring EL element 503 is given to the non-inversion input terminal of the buffer amplifier 502. The output terminal of the buffer amplifier is connected to the power supply line 501. The non-inversion input terminal of the buffer amplifier is connected to the output terminal of the buffer amplifier.",

This prevents the change in luminance and increase in current consumption due to a change in surrounding temperature.",

Each of the blocks simultaneously processes signals associated with some source signal lines, thereby increasing the processing speed of the source signal line driving circuit.",

Each block consists of k latch circuits.",
        "A digital data signal VD inputted from the external is divided into k parts.",
        "The digital data signal VD divided into k parts is obtained by using an external time division signal generating circuit to convert a digital video signal into a signal for the time division gray scale display described above, subjecting to time base expansion a signal of a writing period in each sub-frame period of the converted signal, and converting the expanded signal into a parallel signal for the respective signals associated with the k source signal lines.",
        "A circuit for conducting the time base expansion is provided separately from and outside of the display device.",
        "In response to a signal from a shift register, the block latch (A), 1 simultaneously samples the k parts of the digital data signal VD which are associated with the outputs to the k source signal lines. Similarly, the rest of the blocks of the latch (A) (the latch (A), 2 to the latch (A), m) are selected in order until the k parts of the digital data signal VD which are associated with the outputs to all source signal lines S_1 to S_mk are held in the latch (A). Thereafter, a latch pulse is inputted to the latch (B). Upon input of the latch pulse, the signals held in the blocks of the latch (A) are inputted to the latch (B) all at once, and outputted to the source signal lines S_1 to S_mk.",
        "As described above, it takes about 1/k time for the shift register of the source signal line driving circuit to process if the source signal line driving circuit is divided, as compared with the case where the source signal line driving circuit is not divided.",
        "It is effective also in other driving methods than the time division gray scale method to convert a digital video signal to be inputted to the source signal line driving circuit into a parallel signal for the respective signals associated with the k source signal lines and to simultaneously process the signals associated with the k source signal lines so that the source signal line driving circuit can operate with a margin.",

The electric potential difference makes the amount of current flowing between a drain and a source of the TFT 1901 different from that of the TFT 1902. The currents in the TFTs 1901 and 1902 are denoted by i1 and i2, respectively.",

A drain region of the TFT 1904 and a gate electrode thereof are connected to each other. A gate electrode of the TFT 1903 is connected to the gate electrode of the TFT 1904, and hence the gate electrodes of the two TFTs have the same electric potential. Accordingly, the amount of current flowing between a source and a drain of the TFT 1903 is the same as the amount of current flowing between a source and a drain of the TFT 1904. This means that a current i3 has to be inputted to the current mirror circuit 1922.

A current i4 is supplied from the power supply line 1930 in accordance with the electric potential difference V1. The constant current generator 1912 only generates a constant current i0. A current i5 corresponding to the difference between the current i4 and the current i0 is therefore inputted to a source follower buffer circuit 1924. The current i5 is increased in accordance with the amplified electric potential difference V1.",
        "The source follower buffer circuit 1924 is composed of the TFTs 1906 and 1907. The current i5 inputted from the source ground amplifier circuit 1923 is inputted to a gate electrode of the TFT 1906. With the input current i5, the gate electric potential of the TFT 1906 is raised to increase a current i6 flowing between a source and a drain of the TFT 1906. As a result, a larger amount of current than in the buffer amplifier is outputted.",
        "When an output terminal of the buffer amplifier and the inversion input terminal thereof are connected to each other here, the buffer amplifier operates such that the electric potential of the output terminal obtains the same level as the electric potential of the non-inversion input terminal. The buffer amplifier thus outputs from its output terminal the same level of voltage as the signal voltage inputted to the non-inversion input terminal.",

A silicon oxynitride film (an insulating film of SiOxNy) is used to form a gate insulating film 507 on the gate electrodes. On the gate insulating film 507, an amorphous silicon film is formed and crystallized by laser annealing. The crystallized film is patterned to form semiconductor films 508 to 511 that are crystalline silicon films. The steps up through this point can be carried out with known materials and known techniques. (FIG. 19A)",
        "Next, insulating films 512 to 515 are formed from a silicon oxide film on the semiconductor films 508 to 511. The semiconductor films are doped with phosphorus or arsenic through the insulating films. A known technique can be used as the doping method. As a result, n type impurity regions 516 to 519 are formed. The n type impurity regions 516 to 519 contain phosphorus or arsenic in a concentration of 1\u00d71020 to 1\u00d71021 atoms/cm3.

        "Using the gate electrodes 502 to 505 as masks, the insulating films 512 to 515 are patterned by back side exposure to form insulating films (channel protection films) 520 to 523. In this state, doping of phosphorus or arsenic is again conducted by a known technique. As a result, n type impurity regions 524 to 531 are formed. The n type impurity regions 524 to 531 contain phosphorus or arsenic in a concentration of 1\u00d71017 to 1\u00d71019 atoms/cm3. (FIG. 19C)",
        "Then resist masks 532 and 533 are formed to conduct doping of boron by a known technique. As a result, p type impurity regions 534 to 537 are formed. The p type impurity regions 534 to 537 contain boron in a concentration of 3\u00d71020 to 5\u00d71021 atoms/cm3. Although the p type impurity regions 534 to 537 have already been doped with phosphorus or arsenic, now that they are doped with boron in a concentration 3 times the phosphorus or arsenic concentration or more, the conductivity of the regions 534 to 537 is shifted from n type to p type completely. (FIG. 19D)",
        "The resist masks 532 and 533 are then removed, and a first interlayer insulating film 538 having a laminate structure of a silicon oxide film and a silicon oxynitride film is formed. A contact hole is formed in the first interlayer insulating film 538 to form wirings 539 to 544 in which a molybdenum film and a tungsten film are layered. (FIG. 19E)",
        "Thereafter, a second interlayer insulating film 545, a pixel electrode 546, banks 547a and 547b, an EL layer 548, a cathode 549 and a protective film 550 are formed as shown in FIG. 20. A light emitting device having the sectional structure of FIG. 20 is thus completed.",

        "An EL layer 4029 is formed next. The EL layer 4029 may be formed having a lamination structure, or a single layer structure, by freely combining known EL materials (such as a hole injecting layer, a hole transporting layer, a light emitting layer, an electron transporting layer, and an electron injecting layer). A known technique may be used to determine which structure to use. Further, EL materials exist as low molecular weight materials and high molecular weight (polymer) materials. Evaporation is used when using a low molecular weight material, but it is possible to use easy methods such as spin coating, printing, and ink jet printing when a high molecular weight material is employed.",
        "In embodiment 4, the EL layer is formed by evaporation using a shadow mask. Color display becomes possible by forming emitting layers (a red color emitting layer, a green color emitting layer, and a blue color emitting layer), capable of emitting light having different wavelengths, for each pixel using a shadow mask. In addition, methods such as a method of combining a charge coupled layer (CCM) and color filters, and a method of combining a white color light emitting layer and color filters may also be used. Of course, the EL display device can also be made to emit a single color of light.",
        "After forming the EL layer 4029, a cathode 4030 is formed on the EL layer. It is preferable to remove as much as possible any moisture or oxygen existing in the interface between the cathode 4030 and the EL layer 4029. It is therefore necessary to use a method of depositing the EL layer 4029 and the cathode 4030 in an inert gas atmosphere or within a vacuum. The above film deposition becomes possible in embodiment 4 by using a multi-chamber method (cluster tool method) film deposition apparatus.",
        "Note that a lamination structure of a LiF (lithium fluoride) film and an Al (aluminum) film is used in embodiment 3 as the cathode 4030. Specifically, a 1 nm thick LiF (lithium fluoride) film is formed by evaporation on the EL layer 4029, and a 300 nm thick aluminum film is formed on the LiF film. An MgAg electrode, a known cathode material, may of course also be used. The wiring 4016 is then connected to the cathode 4030 in a region denoted by reference numeral 4031. The wiring 4016 is an electric power supply line for imparting a predetermined voltage to the cathode 4030, and is connected to the FPC 4017 through a conducting paste material 4032.",
        "In order to electrically connect the cathode 4030 and the wiring 4016 in the region denoted by reference numeral 4031, it is necessary to form a contact hole in the interlayer insulating film 4026 and the insulating film 4028. The contact holes may be formed at the time of etching the interlayer insulating film 4026 (when forming a contact hole for the pixel electrode) and at the time of etching the insulating film 4028 (when forming the opening portion before forming the EL layer). Further, when etching the insulating film 4028, etching may be performed all the way to the interlayer insulating film 4026 at one time. A good contact hole can be formed in this case, provided that the interlayer insulating film 4026 and the insulating film 4028 are the same resin material.",

The pixel electrode 43 is nearly equal in area to the pixel, and consequently the entire pixel functions as an EL element. Therefore, the light emitting efficience is extremely high, and a bright image display becomes possible. In addition, a second passivation film 48 is then formed on the anode 47 in embodiment 6.",

The reliability of the EL display device can thus be raised Note that n-channel TFTs and p-channel TFTs may be used for the driver TFT.

A filler 807 (See FIG. 13B) is provided in a space between the active matrix substrate and the covering member within the surrounding first sealing member 805.",
        "Denoted by 808 is a connection wiring for transmitting signals to be inputted to the source signal line driving circuit 801, the gate signal line driving circuit 802 and the pixel portion 803. The wiring receives a video signal, a clock signal and the like from an FPC (flexible printed circuit) 809 that-serves as a terminal for connecting the display device with external equipment.",
        "FIG. 13A is cut along the line A\u2013A\u2032 and the sectional view thereof is shown in FIG. 13B. In FIGS. 13A and 13B, the same components are denoted by the same reference symbols.",
        "As shown in FIG. 13B, the pixel portion 803 and the source signal line driving circuit 801 are formed on a substrate 800. The pixel portion 803 is comprised of a plurality of pixels each having a TFT 851 that controls the amount of current flowing into an EL element (driving TFT), a pixel electrode 852 that is electrically connected to a drain region of the TFT 851, and other components.",
        "In this embodiment, the driving TFT 851 is a p-channel TFT. The driving TFT will be described as a representative of TFTs that constitute the pixel portion. A CMOS circuit in which an n-channel TFT 853 and a p-channel TFT 854 are combined complementarily will be described as a representative of TFTs that constitute the source signal line driving circuit 801.",
        "Each pixel has, under the pixel electrode 852, one of a color filter (R) 855, a color filter (G) 856 and a color filter (B) (not shown). The color filter (R) is a color filter for extracting red light, the color filter (G) is a color filter for extracting green light, and the color filter (B) is a color filter for extracting blue light. The color filter (R) 855 is provided in a red light emitting pixel, the color filter (G) 856 is provided in a green light emitting pixel, and the color filter (B) is provided in a blue light emitting pixel.",
        "The first thing given as an effect of these color filters is that the purity of emitted light is improved in terms of color. For example, the EL element of a red light emitting pixel emits red light (toward the pixel electrode side in this embodiment) and the emitted red light passes through the color filter for extracting red light to gain an improved purity of red color. The same applies to cases of green light and blue light.",
        "In a conventional structure where a color filter is not used, visible light can enter from the outside of the EL display device to excite a light emitting layer of an EL element and to make the color of emitted light different from the desired color. On the other hand, when a color filter is used as in this embodiment, only a specific wavelength of light is allowed to enter an EL element. Thus the inconvenience of EL element being excited by external light can be avoided.",
        "There have been proposed some structures that include using a color filter. The EL element used in these conventional cases is one that emits white light. With the EL element emitting white light, red light is extracted by cutting other wavelengths of light, which invites lowering of luminance. On the other hand, this embodiment in which red light emitted from an EL element passes through the color filter for extracting red light does not lower the luminance.",
        "The pixel electrode 852 is formed from a transparent conductive film and functions as an anode of the EL element. An insulating film 857 is formed on each side of the pixel electrode 852, and a light emitting layer 858 for emitting red light and a light emitting layer 859 for emitting green light are further formed. Though not shown in FIG. 13, a light emitting layer for emitting blue light is formed in a pixel adjacent to the pixel having the light emitting layer 859. Thus color display is obtained by pixels emitting red light, green light and blue light. Needless to say, the pixel having the light emitting layer for emitting blue light is provided with the color filter for extracting blue light.",
        "Other than organic materials, inorganic materials can be used as the EL material. The light emitting layer may be used in combination with one or more of an electron injection layer, an electron transportation layer, a hole transportation layer and a hole injection layer to form a laminate.",
        "A cathode 860 of the EL element is formed on the light emitting layers from a light-shielding conductive film. The cathode 860 is shared by all the pixels, and is electrically connected to the FPC 809 through the connection wiring 808.",
        "Then the first sealing member 805 is formed using a dispenser or the like, a spacer (not shown) is sprayed, and the covering member 804 is bonded. The filler 807 is filled into a region surrounded by the active matrix substrate, the covering member 804 and the first sealing member 805 by vacuum injection.",
        "In this embodiment, the filler 807 is doped in advance with barium oxide as a hygroscopic substance 861. Although the filler is doped with the hygroscopic substance in this embodiment, it may be contained in the filler in chunks dispersed throughout the filler. Alternatively, though not shown, the hygroscopic substance may be used as a material for the spacer.",
        "The filler 807 is then cured by irradiation of ultraviolet light or by heating. Thereafter, an opening (not shown) formed in the first sealing member 805 is closed. After closing the opening in the first sealing member 805, the connection wiring 808 is electrically connected to the FPC 809 with a conductive material 862. The second sealing member 806 is placed so as to cover the exposed portion of the first sealing member 805 and a part of the FPC 809. The second sealing member 806 can be formed from the same material as the first sealing member 805.",
        "The EL element is enclosed in the filler 807 in accordance with the method described above, whereby the EL element is completely shut out from the outside and moisture and substances promoting oxidation of the organic material, such as oxygen, can be prevented from entering the EL element from the outside. Thus an EL display device of high reliability can be manufactured.",
        "This embodiment can be combined freely with Embodiments 1 through 10.",
        "This embodiment shows an example of the case where the traveling direction of the light emitted from the EL element and arrangement of the color filters are different from those of the EL display device shown in Embodiment 11. The description will be given with reference to FIG. 14. The basic structure of FIG. 14 is the same as FIG. 13, and only modified components receive new reference symbols and description.",
        "A pixel portion 901 is comprised of a plurality of pixels each having a TFT 902 that controls the amount of current flowing into the EL element (driving TFT), a pixel electrode 903 that is electrically connected to a drain region of the TFT 902, and other components.",
        "In this embodiment, an n-channel TFT is used for the driving TFT 902 in the pixel portion 901. The drain of the driving TFT 902 is electrically connected to the pixel electrode 903, which is formed from a light-shielding conductive film. The pixel electrode 903 serves as a cathode of the EL element in this embodiment.",
        "On the light emitting layer 858 for emitting red light and the light emitting layer 859 for emitting green light, a transparent conductive film 904 shared by the pixels are formed. The transparent conductive film 904 serves as an anode of the EL element.",
        "Another feature of this embodiment is that a color filter (R) 905, a color filter (G) 906 and a color filter (B) (not shown) are formed in the covering member 804. With an EL element having the structure of this embodiment, light emitted from the light emitting layers travels toward the covering member side. Therefore the color filters can be placed in that path of the light in the structure of FIG. 14.",
        "Forming the color filter (R) 905, the color filter (G) 906 and the color filter (B) (not shown) in the covering member 804 as in this embodiment is advantageous, for the steps of manufacturing an active matrix substrate can be reduced in number to thereby improve the yield and the throughput.",
        "This embodiment can be combined freely with Embodiments 1 through 10.",
        "This embodiment describes a case of actually constructing from elements the constant current generator of the temperature compensation circuit which has the structure shown in FIG. 1 in accordance with Embodiment Mode 1.",
        "FIG. 23 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of the temperature compensation circuit according to this embodiment.",
        "In FIG. 23, a temperature compensation circuit 701 is composed of a constant current generator 704, a monitoring EL element 703 and a buffer amplifier 702.",
        "An output of the constant current generator 704 is connected to one electrode of the monitoring EL element 703 and to an input terminal of the buffer amplifier 702. An output of the buffer amplifier 702 serves as an output of the temperature compensation circuit 701.",
        "The output of the temperature compensation circuit 701 is connected to a power supply line 705, which gives an electric potential to a pixel electrode of an EL element (not shown) in a pixel through the source-drain of a driving TFT (not shown).",
        "The constant current generator 704 is composed of an amplifier 706, a variable resister 707 and a transistor 708.",
        "The transistor 708 is a p-channel TFT in the description given in this embodiment but the transistor is not limited thereto. The polarity of this transistor may be of an n-channel TFT or of a p-channel TFT. Alternatively, the transistor may be a bipolar transistor.",
        "The transistor 708 has a source region connected to an inversion input terminal (\u2212) of the amplifier 706 and to the variable resister 707, and has a drain region connected to an output terminal of the constant current generator 704. A gate electrode of the transistor 708 is connected to an output terminal of the amplifier 706.",
        "A constant voltage V2 is inputted to a non-inversion terminal (+) of the amplifier 706.",
        "The amplifier 706, the variable resister 707 and the transistor 708 that constitute the constant current generator may be formed on an IC chip or on the same substrate which has an insulating surface and on which pixels are formed.",
        "The monitoring EL element 703 connected to the constant current generator 701 operates so as to cause a constant current generated by the constant current generator 701 to flow. If there is a change in surrounding temperature while the display device is in use, the amount of current flowing through the monitoring EL element 703 does not change. Instead, the electric potential of the electrode of the monitoring EL element which is connected to the constant current generator 704 is changed.",
        "The monitoring EL element 703 and an EL element in a pixel are manufactured such that the relation of the amount of current flowing into the element to the level of voltage applied between two electrodes of the element is the same for both the monitoring EL element 703 and the pixel EL element at the same temperature.",
        "The electric potential of an electrode of the monitoring EL element 703 which is not connected to the constant current generator 704 and to a non-inversion input terminal of the buffer amplifier 702 is set to the same level as the electric potential of an opposite electrode of the EL element in each pixel.",
        "In the temperature compensation circuit, an electrode of a pixel EL element (pixel electrode) which is connected to the output terminal of the buffer amplifier has to be an anode if the electrode of the monitoring EL element which is connected to the output of the buffer amplifier and to the constant current generator is an anode. On the other hand, in the temperature compensation circuit, the electrode of the pixel EL element (pixel electrode) which is connected to the output terminal of the buffer amplifier has to be a cathode if the electrode of the monitoring EL element which is connected to the output of the buffer amplifier and to the constant current generator is a cathode.",
        "A case in which the anode of the monitoring EL element is connected to the constant current generator 704 and the buffer amplifier 702 is considered here in this embodiment. In this case, the pixel electrode of the pixel EL element is an anode.",
        "In order to cause a current to flow into the monitoring EL element, an electric potential V1 is set to a level higher than an input electric potential V2. The electric potential V1 is the electric potential of the terminal of the variable resister 707 which is not connected to the transistor 708 and to the non-inversion input terminal of the amplifier 706. The input electric potential V2 is the electric potential inputted to the non-inversion input terminal of the amplifier 706. An electric potential V3 of the anode of the monitoring EL element 703 is set to a level lower than the electric potential V2.",
        "When the electric potential V3 of the anode of the monitoring EL element 703 is changed to change the voltage between the two electrodes thereof, the electric potential of the anode of the pixel EL element is similarly changed to change the voltage between the two electrodes thereof. This change in voltage works to cause a constant current provided by the constant current generator 704 at the surrounding temperature to flow also into the pixel portion EL element. In this way, the pixel portion EL element receives a constant current irrespective of a change in surrounding temperature and emits light of constant luminance.",
        "The structure of the constant current generator is not limited to the structure of 704, but a constant current generator circuit of any known structure can be employed without restriction.",
        "This embodiment can be combined freely with Embodiments 1 through 12.",
        "This embodiment shows results of measuring a change in luminance of a pixel EL element in a display device of the present invention which is caused by a change in temperature.",
        "FIG. 24 is a graph showing the measurement results. In the graph, the axis of ordinate shows the luminance (cd/m2) and the axis of abscissa shows the temperature (\u00b0 C.).",
        "The results shown are of the case where the temperature compensation circuit structured as shown in FIG. 23 is used.",
        "The graph also shows results of measuring a change in luminance of a pixel EL element due to a temperature change in a display device that does not have a temperature compensation circuit.",
        "In the case where no temperature compensation circuit is provided, the luminance of an EL element is increased as the temperature rises. On the other hand, in the case of using the temperature compensation circuit, the luminance of an EL element is almost constant irrespective of the temperature.",
        "The present invention thus can prevent the change in luminance of a pixel portion EL element in a display device due to a temperature change by using a temperature compensation circuit.",
        "The invention is also advantageous in the following point. The EL layer constituting the EL element is formed mainly from organic compounds and degradation thereof is a problem required to be solved. Comparing the case in which a pixel EL element emits light upon receiving a constant current flowing between the electrodes of the element with the case in which a pixel EL element emits light upon receiving a constant voltage applied between the electrodes of the element, lowering of luminance due to the degradation of EL element is less in the former case. Therefore inputting a constant current into a pixel EL element in order to cause the element to emit light as in this embodiment is capable of limiting the lowering of luminance due to the degradation of its EL layer.",
        "Thus can be obtained a display device in which the luminance of a pixel EL element is not changed by a change in surrounding temperature and the luminance is lowered less when the EL element is degraded.",
        "The EL display device manufactured by applying the present invention can be used in various kinds of electronic equipment. The electronic equipment, which incorporates the EL display device manufactured by applying the present invention as the display medium, are explained below.",
        "Such kind of electronic equipment include personal computer, a portable information medium (such as a mobile computer, mobile telephone, a electronic book and so forth), a game machine, a TV receiver, a video camera, a digital camera, a telephone, a head mounted display (goggle type display), an image playback device, a car navigation system and the like. Examples of those are shown in FIG. 9.",

        "Further, if the emission luminance of an EL material is improved in future, the EL material may be used in a front type or rear type projector.",
        "The electronic equipment of this embodiment can be realized using the constitution in which Embodiments 1 to 14 are freely combined.",
        "Conventional EL display devices have problems such as fluctuation in luminance and increased current consumption, for the amount of current flowing into an EL element is changed by a change in surrounding temperature while the devices are in use depending on the temperature characteristic of the EL element even if the voltage applied to the EL element is the same.",
        "Also, a source signal line driving circuit composed of a bottom gate TFT is a hindrance for a display device to obtain a larger screen and more gray scales because of its poor frequency characteristic and resulting slow operation.",
        "The present invention employs the above structures to keep the amount of current flowing into a pixel portion EL element constant against a change in temperature. The invention also gives a margin to sampling of a video signal in the source signal line driving circuit by subjecting the video signal to time base expansion.",
        "In this way, the invention can provide a display device which can prevent the change in luminance and increase in current consumption of the EL element due to a change in surrounding temperature and which can obtain a larger screen, higher definition and more gray scales by compensating the frequency characteristic of a source signal line driving circuit that is composed of a bottom gate TFT."
