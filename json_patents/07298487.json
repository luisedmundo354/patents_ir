        "Road markings are typically provided by application of marking materials such as paint, thermoplastic materials, cold hardening materials, preformed lines, and symbols onto the surface of the road. Road marking materials can be applied with or without addition of colors, e.g. white, yellow, or other colors.",
        "Road markings are often profiled to produce a certain surface textures to enhance special properties, e.g. for enhancing retroreflectivity under conditions of wet or rainy weather, or to produce a signal to the driver of a vehicle in the form of an acoustistic signal or vibration when crossed at speed.",

        "According to current European (CEN) and American (ASTM) standards, road marking performance is measured by the coefficient of retroreflected luminance, RL, determined as the ratio between the retroreflected luminance L of a measured field of the road marking in the direction of observation by the illuminance E1 at the measured field perpendicular to the direction of the incident light.",
        "Illumination and observation are at specified geometrical conditions involving directions at predefined small angles relative to the surface of the road marking to be measured.",
        "It depends on the marking material used, age and wear thereof. A high retroreflected luminance corresponds to a high level of visual performance.",

Adequate visibility of road markings in day driving conditions is generally assured by minimum requirements for the Qd values of the road markings. Requirements are included in national legislation and national road standards and serve as the basis for warranties and contracts.",
        "For testing purposes, portable retroreflectometers and reflectometers are known for the measurement of the RL and Qd of road markings in situ conditions.",
        "Illumination and observation involves particular illumination and observation fields on the surface of the road marking to be measured. In order to reduce influence of any misalignment of the retroreflectometer, when placed on a road for measuring under real conditions of debris and small particles on the road marking, or of texture, profiled road markings, or vertical curves of the road marking, either of the illumination field or the observation field is smaller than the other field and enclosed within that field, in particular the illumination field is chosen as the smaller of the two.",

No. 4,721,389 discloses a method and apparatus for measuring retroreflectivity of a reflective layer on a surface, such as a roadway markings, said method and apparatus comprising steps and means for illuminating a portion of the reflective layer with a laser beam of a predetermined wavelength at an angle of incidence and steps and means for observing the reflected laser beam in an observation angle, filtering the observed reflected laser light, and detecting the filtered reflected laser light in a photometer.",

        "The optical arrangement of a portable retroreflectometer comprises two light channels, one for illumination and one for observation, separated by a wall 110 which wall reduce generation of \u201cfalse\u201d signals by preventing illumination light of the illumination channel in reaching the observation channel.",
        "The illumination channel comprises a light source 101 emitting light through an illumination aperture stop 103 from which light propagates as an illumination beam 105 through an illumination field stop 107. The illumination beam is collimated by a collimating lens 109. A beam splitter 1111 reflects the collimated beam to provide an illumination field 113 on a surface 112 of a road marking or road surface on which the reflectometer is placed.",
        "The observation channel comprises a mirror 111 reflecting light from an observation field 114 originated from the surface 112 and received through the beam splitter 1111 of the illumination channel. The collimating lens 109 focusses light reflected by the mirror 111. An observation field stop 108 defines an observation beam 106. A receiver 102 collects light of the observation beam through an observation aperture stop 104.",

        "The illumination beam 205 passes through a collimating lens 209. A mirror 211 reflects the collimated beam onto an illumination field 213 on the surface 212 of a road marking or road surface on which the reflectometer is placed. The mirror 211 reflects an observation beam 206 from an observation field 214 via the collimating lens 209, here functioning as a focusing lens, onto the receiving part of illumination-receiver unit 200.",
        "The illumination field 213 is enclosed within the observation field 214.",

        "In order to shape the illumination and observation beams, additional optics is required in the illumination-receiver unit. Further, reflections of illumination light might reach the observation channel. In particular, a reflection of the illumination beam 205 in the lower lens surface 2051 and in the upper lens surface 2052 might reach the detector 202 and create false signals.",
        "Such false signals can be avoided by tilting the collimating lens 209 which, however, makes the illumination beam 205 and the observation beam 206 pass the collimating lens 209 at a considerable larger angle to the lens axis 2091 at which the collimating property of the collimating lens is reduced.",

        "This can be accomplish in any suitable way, e.g. the receiving parts of the light receiver itself can define the confined receiving field, so that the aperture stop is not required. Other confined receiving fields includes an entrance of an optical fibre, or the optical image of a receiving field of a different shape or size.",
        "Generally, the light receiver is adapted to the illumination light source. In an embodiment, a long pass absorbtion filter, e.g. an OG 590 from Schott, is used in the light path between the light source and the light receiver, preferably in front of the light receiver.",

        "Generally, the unit separation stop is adapted to stop light from the illumination channel, e.g. either direct light or indirect light from light reflections, in reaching the light receiver of the observation channel. Further the unit separation stop does not influence the extent of the observation field defined with respect to the illumination field.",
        "It is preferred that said unit separation stop is adapted to stop light reflections, including stopping light reflections from unwanted external light source as well as reflections from the illumination unit.",

        "In order to eliminate completely the influence of light penetrating from the illumination to the observation channel, the calibration of the apparatus includes a \u201czero calibration\u201d. A measurement is performed into a light trap of virtually no reflection, or into open air with a sufficient distance to objects, and the reading is adjusted to zero. After this, calibration is done by measurement of a calibration standard with a known light retroreflection value, and the reading is set to this value. The user is guided through this procedure in an automated sequence.",

        "The diffuser comprises a wall having a reflective interior surface, e.g. in form of a white finish applied to interior walls thereof. The reflective interior surface provides multiple reflections of light received therein thereby on average creating an essentially uniform luminance over the interior surface of the diffuser.",
