    "abstract": "A moisture detection system includes an electrical conductor disposed on a surface of a substrate, an oscillator for outputting an oscillator signal at a predetermined amplitude and a predetermined frequency, and a resonator circuit coupled to the electrical conductor and responsive to the oscillator signal for outputting a resonator signal having an amplitude related to a resonant frequency of the electrical conductor. A filter circuit responsive to the resonator signal can output a rectified and filtered signal, and an analog-to-digital converter responsive to the rectified and filtered signal can output a digital signal related to the rectified and filtered signal. A sensor can be provided having a property that varies as a function of a temperature at or adjacent the electrical conductor. A controller can be responsive to the digital signal and the property of the sensor for causing another system to operate as a function thereof.",

No. 6,802,205, entitled MOISTURE DETECTION SYSTEM AND METHOD OF USE THEREOF, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to moisture detection and, more particularly, to moisture detection on a vehicle windshield.",
        "2. Description of the Prior Art",
        "Heretofore, the detection of moisture on a windshield of a vehicle was accomplished in four basic manners: capacitive sensor systems, resistive sensor systems, ultrasonic sensor systems and optical sensor systems.",
        "A capacitive sensor system includes a capacitor formed on the windshield. In response to moisture on the windshield, the capacitance of the capacitor changes. A sensing circuit is connected to detect the changing capacitance and to control the operation of a windshield wiper as a function of the changing capacitance. Examples of capacitive moisture sensors include U.S. Pat. No. 5,668,478 to Buschur; U.S. Pat. No. 5,682,788 to Netzer; U.S. Pat. No. 5,801,307 to Netzer; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,094,981 to Hochstein.",
        "A resistive measurement system includes two conductive elements disposed in spaced relation on the windshield, or another part of the vehicle, such as a conventional whip antenna. Circuitry coupled to the conductive elements measures a change in resistance thereof in response to water bridging the resistive elements and controls the operation of the windshield wiper as a function of the change in resistance. Examples of resistive measurement systems include U.S. Pat. No. 5,659,294 to Schroder; U.S. Pat. No. 5,598,146 to Schroder; U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,718 to Weber; U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,719 to VanDam; U.S. Pat. No. 5,783,743 to Weber; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,900,821 to Petzold.",
        "An ultrasonic sensor system includes a transducer that emits an ultrasonic signal toward a first face of a sheet and receives a reflected ultrasonic signal on a second face of the sheet. The variation in the reflected signal is utilized to determine the presence or absence of foreign bodies on the second face of the sheet. Examples of ultrasonic sensor systems include U.S. Pat. No. 5,818,341 to Saurer et al. and European Publication No. EP0638822.",
        "An optical sensor system includes a light detector positioned to detect light reflected off a windshield from a light source. In response to the presence of moisture on the windshield, the amount of light detected by the light sensor will change due to changing reflection of the light from the light source, thus causing a change in the output of the light sensor. Detecting circuitry detects the change in output from the light detector in response to the change in light impinging thereon and operates the windshield wiper as a function of the change. Examples of light detecting systems include U.S. Pat. No. 5,694,012 to Pientka et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,990,647 to Zettler; U.S. Pat. No. 6,052,196 to Pientka et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,066,933 to Ponziana; U.S. Pat. No. 6,084,519 to Coulling et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,967 to Hochstein; U.S. Pat. No. 5,661,303 to Teder; U.S. Pat. No. 6,250,148 to Lynam; U.S. Pat. No. 6,218,741 to Braun et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,232,603 to Nelson.",
        "A problem with a capacitive sensor system includes the need to form a capacitor having sufficient capacitance whereupon the change in capacitance in response to the presence of rain on the windshield can be detected by suitable detection circuitry. Another problem with a capacitive sensor system is the change in capacitance due to heating or cooling of the metal films forming the capacitor thereby resulting in a change in the capacitance of the capacitor during use.",
        "A problem with a resistive sensor system includes the need to have the resistive elements formed on the outer surface of the windshield whereupon the resistive elements are exposed to weather and possible deterioration. In addition, the resistive elements of a resistive sensor system are also subject to changes in resistance due to changes in the temperature.",
        "A problem with an ultrasonic sensor system and an optical sensor system includes the need to position the transducer of the ultrasonic sensor system and the light transmitter and light receiver of the optical sensor system inside the vehicle to detect the presence of moisture at a suitable location on the windshield. However, positioning the ultrasonic sensor system or the optical sensor system at a suitable location on the windshield often results in partially blocking a driver's view through the windshield or in the positioning of such sensor system at less than an optimal location for detecting the presence of moisture on the windshield. Moreover, the sensitivity of an optical sensor to detect moisture can be compromised by the color or shade of the windshield in the path of the light propagating from the light transmitter to the light receiver.",
        "It would, therefore, be desirable to provide a small, nearly invisible, moisture detector disposed on either a flexible substrate that is coupled to a sheet, such as a windshield, or on the sheet itself. The moisture detector can be coupled to circuitry for stimulating the moisture detector and circuitry for detecting a change in a characteristic of the moisture detector due to the presence of moisture on the sheet. It would also be desirable to provide a method for detecting the change of the characteristic of the moisture detector as a function of the temperature of the sheet.",
        "The invention is a moisture detection system that includes an electrical conductor disposed on a surface of a substrate. The electrical conductor has a resonant frequency that varies as a function of an amount of moisture present adjacent the electrical conductor. An oscillator outputs an oscillator signal at a predetermined amplitude and a predetermined frequency. A resonator circuit is coupled to the electrical conductor and is responsive to the oscillator signal for outputting a resonator signal having an amplitude related to the resonant frequency of the electrical conductor. A filter circuit is responsive to the resonator signal for outputting a rectified and filtered signal. An analog-to-digital converter is responsive to the rectified and filtered signal for outputting a digital signal related to the rectified and filtered signal. A sensor is provided that has a property that varies as a function of a temperature at or adjacent the electrical conductor is provided. A controller is responsive to the digital signal and the property of the sensor for causing another system to operate as a function thereof.",
        "The other system can be a wiper system that is responsive to the controller for adjusting a rate moisture is removed from adjacent the electrical conductor as a function of an amount of moisture present adjacent the electrical conductor and/or a rate moisture accumulates adjacent the electrical conductor. The wiper system can include a means for wiping.",
        "The wiper system can be responsive to the digital signal and the property of the sensor for causing the wiping means to remove moisture from a surface.",
        "The predetermined frequency can be between (i) 300 and 700 kHz or (ii) 400 and 600 kHz.",
        "The substrate can be a vehicle windshield having a plurality of transparent sheets laminated together and the electrical conductor can be sandwiched between the sheets.",
        "The substrate can be a flexible substrate. The vehicle windshield can have a plurality of transparent sheets laminated together with the flexible substrate sandwiched between the transparent sheets. An electrically conductive coating can be disposed on a surface of at least one transparent sheet. Said surface can be a side of the flexible substrate opposite the electrical conductor. The flexible substrate can further include (i) a ground conductor disposed on the flexible substrate at least partially surrounding the electrical conductor or (ii) a conductive material, in the form of a faraday shield, disposed on a surface of the flexible substrate opposite the electrical conductor.",
        "The resonator circuit can include a capacitor connected between the electrical conductor and a reference voltage and a resistor connected between the oscillator and the electrical conductor side of the capacitor. The filter circuit can include a diode connected to conduct current from the resonator toward the analog-to-digital converter and a capacitor connected between an end of the diode adjacent the analog-to-digital converter and the reference voltage.",
        "The invention is also a moisture detector system that includes means disposed on a substrate for conducting electrical current, the conducting means having a resonant frequency that changes as a function of moisture adjacent the conducting means; an oscillator for outputting to the conducting means an oscillator signal having a predetermined frequency and a first amplitude; means responsive to the oscillator signal for outputting a resonator signal having a second amplitude related to the resonant frequency of the conducting means, wherein the second amplitude is different than the first amplitude; means having a property whose value varies as a function of a temperature at or adjacent the conducting means; and means responsive to the resonator signal and the value of the property for outputting a control signal having a value related to the second amplitude of the resonator signal.",
        "The moisture detector can further include a wiper system responsive to the control signal for wiping moisture from adjacent the conducting means based on an amount of moisture adjacent the conducting means and/or a rate moisture accumulates adjacent the conducting means.",
        "The conducting means can include (i) one or more lines of conductive material, (ii) one or more sheets of conductive material, and/or (iii) a dispersion of conductive particles in the form of one or more lines and/or sheets.",
        "The substrate can be a windshield that includes plural sheets of glass laminated together. The conducting means can be sandwiched between the sheets of glass.",

        "The conducting means can include one or more lines of electrically conductive material disposed on the flexible substrate.",
        "The sheet can be a windshield that includes plural sheets of glass laminated together.",

        "The moisture detector can further include an electrically conductive coating disposed on a surface of at least one sheet. The surface can be positioned on a side of the flexible substrate opposite the conducting means.",
        "The invention is also a method of moisture detection comprising (a) providing a substrate having an electrical conductor disposed thereon; (b) stimulating the electrical conductor with an oscillator signal in the absence of moisture adjacent the electrical conductor; (c) detecting a value of a temperature dependent property acquired from a location at or adjacent the electrical conductor on or about the time step (b) is performed; (d) determining a first amplitude of the electrical conductor to the stimulation in step (b) as a function of the value of the temperature dependent property detected in step (c); (e) stimulating the electrical conductor with the oscillator signal when moisture is present adjacent the electrical conductor; (f) detecting the value of the temperature dependent property on or about the time step (e) is performed; (g) determining a second amplitude of the electrical conductor to the stimulation in step (e) as a function of the value of the temperature dependent property detected in step (f), wherein the second amplitude is different than the first amplitude due to a change in resonant frequency of the electrical conductor in response to the presence of moisture adjacent the electrical conductor; and (h) determining a difference between the first amplitude and the second amplitude, wherein the difference is related to the amount of moisture present adjacent the electrical conductor.",

However, it is to be understood that the invention can assume various alternative orientations and, accordingly, such terms are not to be considered as limiting. Further, all numbers expressing dimensions, physical characteristics, and so forth, used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term \u201cabout\u201d. Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical values set forth in the following specification and claims can vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Moreover, all ranges disclosed herein are to be understood to encompass any and all subranges subsumed therein. For example, a stated range of \u201c1 to 10\u201d should be considered to include any and all subranges between (and inclusive of) the minimum value of 1 and the maximum value of 10; that is, all subranges beginning with a minimum value of 1 or more and ending with a maximum value of 10 or less, and all subranges in between. Also, as used herein, terms such as \u201cpositioned on\u201d or \u201csupported on\u201d mean positioned or supported on but not necessarily in direct surface contact with. For example, a substrate \u201cpositioned on\u201d a glass sheet does not preclude the presence of one or more other materials located between the substrate and the surface of the sheet.",
        "With reference to FIG. 1, a sheet or panel of optically transparent material, such as a sheet of glass or a vehicle windshield 2, includes a moisture detector 4 disposed thereon or incorporated therein. In a first nonlimiting embodiment of the present invention, moisture detector 4-1 includes one or more electrical conductors 6 connected to a connector, e.g. conductive foil 8, which is utilized for connecting electronic circuitry to electrical conductor 6. In the nonlimiting embodiment shown in FIG. 1, foil 8 is shown extending outside the periphery of windshield 2. However, this is not to be construed as limiting the invention since foil 8 may be disposed entirely within the periphery of windshield 2.",
        "With reference to FIG. 2, and with continuing reference to FIG. 1, windshield 2 is desirably formed by outer and inner glass plies 10 and 12 bonded together by a plastic interlayer 14, such as polyvinylbutyral, to form windshield 2 as a unitary structure. Plies 10 and 12, however, may be other transparent rigid material, such as, but not limited to, polycarbonate. Each electrical conductor 6 can be disposed on an inward or an outward facing surface of glass ply 10 or glass ply 12. Each electrical conductor 6 can be a conductive wire or sheet, or a conductive coating applied to one of the surfaces of glass ply 10 or glass ply 12 in the form of a line or a sheet, or a dispersion of electrically conductive particles applied to one of the surfaces of glass ply 10 or glass ply 12 in the form of a line or a sheet. Although not required, each electrical conductor 6 has a width and/or thickness that renders it not easily discernable to the naked eye. In one nonlimiting embodiment of the invention, the width of the electrical conductors 6 is no greater than 0.35 mm, for example no greater than 0.30 mm or no greater than 0.25 mm.",
        "With reference to FIGS. 3-5, in a second nonlimiting embodiment, moisture detector 4-2 includes one or more electrical conductors 6 disposed on a flexible substrate 16. In FIGS. 3 and 4, part of flexible substrate 16 including electrical conductor(s) 6 disposed thereon extends outside the periphery of windshield 2 to facilitate connection of electronic circuitry to electrical conductor(s) 6. However, this is not to be construed as limiting the invention since flexible substrate 16 having electrical conductor(s) 6 disposed thereon may be disposed entirely within the periphery of windshield 2.",
        "As shown in FIG. 4, flexible substrate 16 can be sandwiched between glass plies 10 and 12 with electrical conductor 6 facing an inward facing surface of glass ply 10 or glass ply 12, or one of the outward facing surfaces of plastic interlayer 14. Alternatively, flexible substrate 16 can be disposed on an outward facing surface of glass ply 10 or glass ply 12 with electrical conductor 6 facing toward or away from said outward facing surface. As another alternative, the flexible substrate 16 can be incorporated within the interlayer 14. Although not required, to avoid undesirable exposure of flexible substrate 16 and/or electrical conductor(s) 6 to, among other things, moisture and/or particulate contaminant(s), it is desirable to position flexible substrate 16 between glass plies 10 and 12 versus positioning flexible substrate 16 on an outward facing surface of glass ply 10 or glass ply 12.",
        "Flexible substrate 16 can be formed from any suitable flexible and insulative material, such as, but not limited to, polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), polyvinylbutyral (PVB), ultra-thin glass, etc. In one nonlimiting embodiment, substrate 16 is 2 mil thick PET. A desired pattern of electrical conductor(s) 6 can be formed from a sheet of any suitable electrically conductive material adhered to flexible substrate 16 utilizing conventional photolithographic processing techniques. The desired pattern of electrical conductor(s) 6 can also be formed on flexible substrate 16 by screen printing a suitable conductive material in the desired pattern on flexible substrate 16 or by ink jetting a suitable conductive material in the desired pattern on flexible substrate 16. The desired pattern of electrical conductor(s) 6 can also be formed on flexible substrate 16 by a wire, such as, but not limited to, copper wire, secured to or embedded within the substrate 16. Although not required, in one nonlimiting embodiment, the wire has a small diameter so that the wire is less visible in the windshield 2. In one nonlimiting embodiment, the wire is 36 AWG tin plated copper wire. As discussed above, it should be appreciated that rather than using a flexible substrate, the conductors 6 can be applied directly to a surface of the glass plies or interlayer. For example, and without limiting the present invention, rather than combining the wire with the substrate 16, the wire can be secured to or embedded within the interlayer 14. The foregoing methods of forming the pattern of electrical conductor(s) 6 on flexible substrate 16 are not to be construed as limiting the invention since the use of any suitable means for forming the desired pattern of electrical conductor(s) 6 on flexible substrate 16 is envisioned.",
        "With reference to FIGS. 5 and 6, and with continuing reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, the portion of flexible substrate 16 extending outside the periphery of windshield 2 can have electrical conductor(s) 6 sandwiched between flexible substrate 16 and an insulative material 17 adhered to electrical conductor(s) 6. Insulative material 17 can be formed from a sheet of suitable insulative material, such as, without limitation, Kapton\u00ae polyimide film (Kapton\u00ae is a registered trademark of E.I. DuPont de Nemoirs and Company Corporation, Wilmington, Del.), or any other suitable solid or flowable insulative material that acts to protect electrical conductor(s) 6. Since the portions of electrical conductor(s) 6 and substrate 16 sandwiched between glass plies 10 and 12 are protected thereby from moisture and/or particulate contaminant(s), an end of insulative material 17 can terminate between glass plies 10 and 12.",
        "To avoid exposure of electrical conductor(s) 6 sandwiched between glass plies 10 and 12 to moisture and/or particulate contaminant(s), an adhesive 18, e.g., a thermoset adhesive, can be disposed on the electrical conductor 6 side of flexible substrate 16 positioned between glass plies 10 and 12. This adhesive 18 covers the end of insulative material 17 sandwiched between glass plies 10 and 12 and extends between glass plies 10 and 12 a sufficient distance so that when it is cured, adhesive 18 forms with glass plies 10 and 12 and plastic interlayer 14 a hermetic seal that inhibits moisture and/or particulate contaminant(s) from contacting the portion of electrical conductor(s) 6 sandwiched between glass plies 10 and 12.",
        "Another adhesive 19, e.g., a pressure sensitive adhesive, can be disposed between flexible substrate 16 and plastic interlayer 14 for securing the position of flexible substrate 16 between glass plies 10 and 12 prior to exposing adhesive 18 and plastic interlayer 14 to a curing heat.",
        "As shown in FIG. 5, flexible substrate 16 can include a ground conductor 7 that at least partially surrounds electrical conductor(s) 6. Connecting ground conductor 7 to an external reference voltage 34, such as ground, forms a ground loop around electrical conductor(s) 6. This ground loop avoids undesirable electromagnetic interference from affecting the operation of electrical conductor(s) 6 acting as a resonating element of moisture detector 4-2. Moreover, as shown in FIG. 6, a side of flexible substrate 16 opposite electrical conductor(s) 6 can also or alternatively include a conductive material 46 disposed thereon that can be connected to external reference voltage 34. Conductive material 46 can be in the form of a sheet, one or more lines, a mesh, or any other suitable form that defines a faraday shield that avoids undesirable electromagnetic interference from affecting the operation of electrical conductor(s) 6 acting as the resonating element of moisture detector 4-2.",

        "It is believed that the zigzag path of the conductors as discussed above increases the sensitivity of the moisture detector by providing multiple electric field emitting points along its length. More specifically, it has been observed that a straight conductor element used as a moisture detecting element in one embodiment of the moisture detector of the present invention will have a higher electric field strength at the ends of the element as compared to the electric field strength along its length. By forming the conductors in a zigzag pattern, additional distinct points or tips are formed along its length. At each of these points, the element will have a higher electric field strength as compared to a straight portion of the element, thus creating more sensitive transmitting points in the same overall distance as the straight element. As a result of the more sensitive transmitting points with higher field strength, water drops deposited along the length of the zigzag pattern will cause relatively larger changes in impedance of the moisture detector element and hence would be more detectable in comparison to deposition on the straight line pattern.",

As discussed above, the control signal supplied by microprocessor 20 to windshield wiper motor control 36 is related to the difference between the first and second digital signals sampled by microprocessor 20. In order to control windshield wiper system 30 in accordance with the amount of moisture on windshield 2 adjacent moisture detector 4, the numerical range of digital difference values that can be processed by microprocessor 20 is divided into sections based on the desired control of windshield wiper system 30. For example, if the range of digital difference values is divided into two sections, the section corresponding to the upper numerical range of difference values corresponds to operating windshield wiper system 30 at a high speed while the lower numerical range of difference values corresponds to operating windshield wiper system 30 at a low speed. Thus, if a difference value between a current sample of the second digital signal and the first digital signal is within the upper numerical range of difference values, microprocessor 20 outputs the control signal which causes windshield wiper motor control 36 to control windshield wiper motor 38 to operate windshield wiper blade 40 at a high speed.

This correction factor adjusts the value of the digital signal based on the measured temperature at or adjacent moisture detector 4 whereupon the control signal output by microprocessor 20 to the windshield wiper system controlling the movement of the wiper blade on rear window 202 is adjusted for temperature, thereby avoiding inadvertent operation or non-operation of the windshield wiper system that is operative for controlling the motion of the wiper blade on rear window 202.",
        "While the temperature sensor in FIG. 12a is illustrated as being outside of the wiping area of wiper blade 40, it is desirable that the temperature sensor be positioned in the path of the wiper blade to detect a temperature in said path. However, this is not to be construed as limiting the invention.",
        "Typically, the accumulation of fine mist and the response time of having moisture cleared off of rear window 202 by the wiper blade is not as important on rear window 202 as it would be on the front windshield of vehicle 200. Accordingly, the control signal output by microprocessor 20 that causes the wiper blade to wipe moisture from rear window 202 can be set to be related to a larger difference between the first and second digital signals sampled by microprocessor 20 from the one or more resistive wires 206 acting as the fifth embodiment moisture detector 4-5.",
        "If desired, microprocessor 20 can be operative for detecting when the one or more resistive wires 206 is being utilized for heating rear window 202. For example, microprocessor 20 can be operative for detecting the open and closed states of switch 210 via a line 220 coupled between microprocessor 20 and switch 210. In response to detecting that switch 210 is in its open state (shown in FIG. 13), microprocessor 20 can utilize the one or more resistive wires 206 as the fifth embodiment moisture detector 4-5 under the assumption that the one or more resistive wires are not being utilized for heating rear window 202. In contrast, in response to detecting switch 210 is in its closed state, microprocessor 20 does not utilize the one or more resistive wires 206 as the fifth embodiment moisture detector 4-5 under the assumption that the one or more resistive wires 206 are already being utilized to heat rear window 202.",
        "Also or alternatively, microprocessor 20 can be operative for utilizing the one or more resistive wires 206 as the fifth embodiment moisture detector 4-5 regardless of whether switch 210 is in its open or closed state. Specifically, at suitable times, microprocessor 20 can cause poles 214 and 216 of switch 212 to switch to their respective second positions for a time sufficient for microprocessor 20 to sample the output of analog-to-digital converter 28 when said one or more resistive wires 206, acting as the fifth embodiment moisture detector 4-5, are receiving the oscillator signal. Thereafter, microprocessor 20 can cause poles 214 and 216 to return to their respective first positions whereupon said one or more resistive wires 206 can be utilized (or nor utilized) as heating element(s) when switch 210 is in its closed (or open) state.",
        "The illustration of the simplified circuit diagram of FIG. 13, especially switch 212, for switching one or more resistive wires 206 of heating grid 204 between use as heating element(s) for heating rear window 202 and the fifth embodiment moisture sensor 4-5 is not to be construed as limiting the invention since it is envisioned at any suitable and/or desirable means for switching the functions of the one or more resistive wires 206 is envisioned. Moreover, the illustration of switch 210 in FIGS. 12b and 13 is not to be construed as limiting the invention.",
        "With reference to FIGS. 14a-14d, various different embodiments of electrical conductor 6 of the first and second embodiments of moisture detectors 4-1 and 4-2 are illustrated. FIG. 14a and FIG. 5 show electrical conductor 6 formed in a serpentine pattern. FIGS. 14b and 14c show three parallel electrical conductors 6 extending in spaced relation from a common node. As indicated by the dashed extensions of electrical conductors 6 in FIGS. 14b and 14c, electrical conductors 6 can be formed to any desired length. Lastly, in FIG. 14d, two parallel electrical conductors 6 extend in spaced relation from a common node. Again, the dashed lines extending from electrical conductors 6 in FIG. 12d indicate that electrical conductors 6 can have any desired length.",
        "The present invention has several advantages over prior art systems for detecting moisture. These advantages include moisture detector 4 being essentially invisible to the naked eye from about one meter; moisture detector 4 can be disposed in a clear or non-transparent part of windshield 2; moisture detector 4 is not sensitive to dirt; moisture detector 4 can detect the presence of moisture over a larger area than prior art sensors of comparable size; moisture detector 4 is useful with substrates of various thickness and composition; moisture detector 4 is more uniformly responsive than prior art sensors; and the present invention can more readily detect the presence of moisture droplets of smaller size, e.g., dew or mist, on windshield 2 than the prior art systems for detecting moisture.",
        "With reference to FIG. 15 and with reference back to FIG. 10, the present invention can also be utilized to detect a level of one or more fluids, such as the level of a fluid in a vehicle. Specifically, moisture detector 4 can be mounted on an electrically and magnetically nonconductive fluid reservoir 42. Preferably, moisture detector 4 is mounted on an exterior of fluid reservoir 42 adjacent a lower end thereof. However, this is not to be construed as limiting the invention. Fluid reservoir 42 can be configured to receive windshield washer fluid, radiator fluid, or any other fluid utilized by a vehicle, the level of which fluid can be measured utilizing moisture detector 4 and the electronic circuitry shown in FIG. 15.",
        "In order to detect the level of fluid in fluid reservoir 42, the oscillator signal is supplied to electrical conductor 6 or 106 of moisture detector 4 when no fluid is received in fluid reservoir 42. A first response of moisture detector 4 is sampled and stored for later use. At suitable times when fluid is received in the fluid reservoir, plural second responses of moisture detector 4 to the oscillator signal are sampled. Each second response is compared to the first response. When a second response has a predetermined relation to the first response, the electronic circuitry outputs a corresponding control signal which activates a suitable indicator, e.g., \u201ccheck washer fluid\u201d, \u201ccheck radiator fluid\u201d, etc.",
        "It is to be appreciated that decreasing the fluid level in fluid reservoir 42 decreases the difference between the first response and the second response of moisture detector 4. Thus, when the second response has the predetermined relation to the first response indicative of the fluid level decreasing to a predetermined level, the electronic circuitry outputs the control signal. To facilitate detecting the change in the resonant frequency of moisture detector 4, the predetermined frequency of the oscillator signal can be selected to optimize the change in impedance of moisture detector 4 in response to the presence of fluid in fluid reservoir 42. Similar comments apply in respect of the change in resonant frequency of moisture detector 4 due to the presence of moisture on windshield 2.",
        "When a vehicle includes multiple moisture detectors 4, a multiplexer (not shown) can be connected between each moisture detector 4 and the electronic circuitry shown in FIG. 15. Under the control of microprocessor 20, the multiplexer can selectively connect the electronic circuitry to each moisture detector 4 for supplying the oscillator signal at an appropriate frequency to each moisture detector 4 and for detecting the response of each moisture detector 4 to the supplied oscillator signal. Preferably, under the control of the software program, microprocessor 20 can adjust the frequency of the oscillator signal output by frequency generator 22 to optimize the change in the resonant frequency of each moisture detector 4 to detect the presence or absence of a particular fluid.",
        "The invention has been described with reference to several nonlimiting embodiments. Obvious modifications and alterations will occur to others upon reading and understanding the preceding detailed description. For example, while described in connection with the detection of moisture on windshield 2, the present invention can also be utilized to detect moisture on surfaces of rigid or flexible substrates utilized in connection with other applications. Similarly, while described in connection with detection of fluid levels in a fluid reservoir 42 mounted on a vehicle, the present invention can also be utilized to detect the level of a fluid received in a fluid reservoir utilized in other applications. Moreover, while described in connection with the control of windshield wiper system 30, microprocessor 20 can also be utilized to control a vehicle headlamp system, a vehicle windshield dehumidification system and/or any other vehicle or non-vehicle based system that it is desired to control as a function of the presence of moisture on a substrate. Still further, while the various components of the electronic circuitry are preferably connected by conductors, it should be appreciated that suitable signals can be conveyed between two or more of these components via suitable radio frequency (RF) and/or optical signal means. Microprocessor 20 can also be configured to record for subsequent retrieval and display, the days when moisture is detected on a substrate and/or the extent of operation of windshield wiper system 30. This information can then be used for information purposes, e.g., to determine the number of days in a month it rains, and/or to estimate when blades of the windshield wiper system 30 may require replacement. Moreover, it is to be appreciated that the description of analog-to-digital converter 28 as being operative for converting analog signals from filter circuit 26, temperature sensor 122 and switch 210 into corresponding digital signals is not to be construed as limiting the invention since it is envisioned that the conversion of each analog signal into a corresponding digital signal for processing by microprocessor 20 can occur in any suitable and/or desirable manner, such as, without limitation, a separate analog-to-digital converter under the control of microprocessor 20, the combination of a multiplexer (not shown) under the control of microprocessor 20 for switching each analog signal to the input of analog-to-digital converter 28, or some combination of at least one multiplexer and two or more analog-to-digital converters. Lastly, the illustration in FIG. 10 of microprocessor 20 and analog-to-digital converter 28 being separate components is not to be construed as limiting the invention since it is envisioned that the functions of microprocessor 20 and one or more analog-to-digital converter 28 can be incorporated into a single component, e.g., a single integrated circuit. It is intended that the invention be construed as including all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof."
