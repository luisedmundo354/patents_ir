        "Historically, coatings have been applied to substrates, both to protect the substrates and to improve the properties of the substrates. For example, and without limitation, coatings have been developed to protect substrates from various environmental conditions and to protect substrates during contact of the substrates with other objects. Moreover, coatings have been developed to improve properties of substrates such as durability, strength, environmental resistance and the like.",

As an example, coatings are used for protecting vehicle components against cosmetic damage (e.g., degradation, marring, denting) due to corrosion, abrasions, impacts, chemicals, ultraviolet light, thermal cycling or the like. While, it is desirable for such coatings to protect against cosmetic damage, it is also desirable to provide a composition that is relatively easy to handle, and particularly exhibits relatively low volatile emissions. Thus, the present invention provides a composition for forming a coating with improved protection capabilities, ease of handling and relatively low volatile emissions.",

The composition may be applied to a surface of a substrate using suitable art-disclosed techniques, including but not limited to brushing, rolling, dipping, dripping, extruding, curtain coating, swabbing, spraying or the like. Moreover, the composition may be applied continuously or intermittently upon a surface of a substrate.",
        "Nearly any substrate may receive the composition to form a coating thereon. The composition may be applied to metal, plastic, or composite substrates, wood substrates or the like. In preferred embodiments, the composition is applied to coated or uncoated surfaces of metal components. In highly preferred embodiments, the composition is applied to painted or e-coated surfaces of automotive components (e.g., to form a truck bedliner, by coating one or more of the floor, side walls, head board, tail gate or other component of a pick-up truck cargo box) and may be applied in addition to or as a replacement for a clear coat. Depending on the desired texture of the coating, the composition may be applied to achieve a smooth surface (e.g., a class A finish) or a roughened or even coarse surface over part or all of the surface.",
        "In certain embodiments, the coated or uncoated surface of a substrate may be treated prior to application of the composition. The surface of a substrate, may be sanded, scuffed, primed or otherwise treated prior to application of the composition to the substrate. For example, it may be desirable to apply a suitable adhesion promoter or primer to the surface to be coated. An example of one such primer is available commercially from The Dow Chemical Company under the name BETAGUARD\u2122 67725. Advantageously, such pre-treatment techniques can assist the coating formed on the substrate to tenaciously adhere to the surface of the substrate. In a highly preferred embodiment, the substrate is pre-treated with a plasma, for example, for ionizing oxygen (O2) molecules that are then directed toward the surface of the substrate. In this manner, the plasma treatment forms suitable groups (e.g., ketone or hydroxyl groups) that bond with the composition such that the composition forms a coating that is even more tenaciously adhered to the surface of the substrate. Of course, other suitable surface treatments may be employed as desired. Examples of various potential surface treatments are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,298,587; U.S. Pat. No. 5,320,875; U.S. Pat. No. 5,433,786; U.S. Pat. No. 5,494,712 U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,958 incorporated herein by reference.",
        "Thus, it will be appreciated that the application of the coating composition of the present invention will result, in certain preferred embodiments, in forming a laminate of a substrate (e.g., metal (such as steel, magnesium, titanium or aluminum), plastic (such as including a polyurethane, a polystyrene, a polyester, polyolefin, a nylon, an epoxy, an acrylic, or the like), a ceramic, a composite, or otherwise), optionally having a layer from a primer or plasma treatment, optionally having one or more coats (e.g., base coat, top coat, clear coat, such as an art-disclosed 2-component urethane or acrylic coating) thereon, and having the coating composition of the present invention thereon.",
        "According to one preferred protocol, and referring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a system 10 for combining isocyanate and amine components to form the composition and for applying the composition to a substrate. As shown, the system 10 includes a supply 12 of isocyanate and a supply 14 of amine-based resin. The system 10 also includes a metering system 20 having a first metering container 22 for receiving a predetermined amount of isocyanate and a second metering container 24 for receiving a predetermined amount of resin. Each of the metering containers 22, 24 are in fluid communication with a nozzle 30.",
        "In a preferred approach to applying the composition to a surface, the surface is prepared as desired and provided at a suitable application point. The isocyanate and amine-functional components are delivered to a suitable dispenser. Preferably, the components are independently metered to a mixing chamber, where they are mixed by direct impingement at a controlled ratio, and thereafter released from the dispenser as a mist or fine spray. For example, with reference to FIG. 1, isocyanate and amine components are pumped from their respective supplies 12, 14 to their respective metering containers 22, 24. Thereafter, the isocyanate and amine components in the containers 22, 24 are expelled under pressure from the containers 22, 24 to the nozzle 30 (e.g., which may be part of a gun block) and are expelled from the nozzle 30 as a spray 34. Preferably, the nozzle 30 includes an internal space or cavity (not shown) wherein the isocyanate component and amine component can intermix, atomize or both such that the resulting spray 34 is a substantially homogeneous composition. The pressure used to expel the spray 34 is preferably greater than about 1000 psi and more preferably between about 1500 psi and 2000 psi.",
        "To apply the composition to a substrate, the substrate may be moved relative to the nozzle 30, the nozzle 30 may be moved relative to the substrate or a combination thereof such that the spray 34 is directed at the substrate for layering the composition on the substrate.",
        "It is contemplated that the application system 10 of FIG. 1 may be designed as a robotic system. For example, the nozzle 30, the metering containers 22, 24 or both may be mounted on a robot arm (not show), which may be programmed to move the nozzle 30 as it sprays the composition such that a substrate may be coated as desired. Moreover, such a robotic system could apply coatings upon truck bedliners in an automotive assembly plant or at another location during assembly or formation of a truck. In alternative embodiments, however, the composition may be applied after full assembly of a truck. Advantageously, the composition emits minimal airborne chemicals during application such that spraying systems for applying the composition may be used in a variety of locations.",
        "Although, the composition may be applied at room temperature (e.g., around 20\u00b0 C.), it may be desirable to heat the isocyanate, the amine or both to no greater than about 90\u00b0 C. prior to application to improve the mixing efficiency, flow and wetting properties of the composition during application. Once applied, the composition may be allowed to cure upon the substrate to form a protective coating. Curing may occur at a wide variety of temperatures. Generally, curing desirably occurs at room temperature in the absence of applied heat. However, cooling or heating measures may also be taken to lower or raise the temperature of curing.",
        "In preferred embodiments, the rate of curing of the composition may be at least partially chemically controlled. For example, curing of the composition may be controlled by the rate of reaction of the amine component with the isocyanate component. Typically, primary amines react comparatively quickly with the isocyanate while secondary amines react comparatively slowly. Thus, the amine component may be provided as a mixture of primary and secondary amines that are combined according to weight ratios that are chosen as desired to control the rates of curing of the composition to form the coating. Weight ratios of primary amine to secondary amine appropriate for process of application similar to the one described and shown in FIG. 1 are approximately range from about 0:1 to about 0.8:1 and is preferably about 0.5:1.",
        "Preferably, the composition is well mixed into a substantially homogeneous liquid mixture prior to application to a substrate. Thus, upon curing (which may be accomplished substantially without the need to apply heat to the coating), the composition will form a substantially homogeneous coating. The coating may be applied in one or more layers of one or more continuous or variable thickness. Preferred thickness for coatings on automotive components (e.g., for forming a truck bedliner) range from about 0.5 millimeter to about 20 millimeters, more preferably from about 1 millimeter to about 10 millimeters and most preferably from about 3 millimeters to about 5 millimeters. The thickness may vary across a substrate, randomly or according to a predetermined pattern.",
        "In certain embodiments, the protective coatings formed according to the present invention exhibit various advantageous properties. For example, and without limitation, coatings according to the present invention can exhibit strength both adhesive and cohesive up to and greater than 300 psi when applied to painted and e-coated surfaces. Additionally, preferred embodiments of the coating exhibit superior resistance to degradation caused by UV radiation, moisture, thermal cycles, chemical (e.g., alkali) exposure, salt and the like. For example, the coating exhibits substantially no blistering, cracking or charring when sag panel aged for two weeks at about 70\u00b0 C. Likewise, upon two weeks of water immersion at 32\u00b0 C., the coating exhibits substantially no blistering, dulling, or softening or loss of adhesion. Like results are also realizable upon exposure to 100% relative humidity at 38\u00b0 C. for two weeks.",
        "Also advantageously, the coating resists fluid spotting such as from liquid soap, windshield solvent, coolant, motor oil, bug and tar remover or the like. It resists color change, dulling, softening or surface distortion from contact with fuel, as well as from contact with acid or alkali substances.",
        "Table 1 illustrates some additional approximate properties realizable from the coating of the present invention.",

        "Moreover, the coating may desirably exhibit anti-skid properties. Each of the properties discussed make coatings of the present invention desirable for protecting automotive vehicle components and especially as a truck bed liner. In a highly preferred embodiment, the coating composition is employed as original equipment for an automotive vehicle, though it may also be provided for after-market application.",
        "Thus, preferably the vehicle is provided and during the vehicle assembly process or otherwise prior to delivery to an end consumer, the vehicle is contacted with the coating composition of the present invention. The application of the coating may be done prior to the vehicle painting operation, during the painting operation, or after the painting operation. Preferably, application of the coating is performed at the same facility as the painting of the vehicle. However, it is also possible that it is performed at a remote site. The coating may be applied directly to an untreated or bare surface, to a primed surface, to a surface of a galvannealed steel, to painted surface (e.g., with or without a clear coat, or possibly even to a surface coated by overspray in the painting or other finishing operations of the vehicle).",
        "Of course, the coating composition may also be employed in other applications by contacting it with a surface of a substrate, such as that found in or on a storage container, shipping container, rail car, waste container, pallet, or the like. It may also be suitably employed for hard surfaces such as panels, doors, flooring, pavement or the like.",
        "The following examples describe, without limitation, one illustrative composition in accordance with the present invention.",
        "Table 2 below provides one precise formulation by weight for an exemplary composition in accordance with the present invention. The composition is formed by combining approximately 56.5% by volume of a first component (mixed at ambient temperature), with approximately 43.5% by volume of a second component.",

        "The components of the composition are sprayed onto a surface of a painted bed of a pick up truck, while maintaining the temperature of the ingredients at or below about 80\u00b0 C. The coating is allowed to cure in place. The resulting coating exhibits adhesive failure at a stress of greater than 100 psi (as would be measured by stress applied by an Instron tester to a 6.5 cm2 button adhered to the coated surface with a 2 part-epoxy resin).",
        "Example 1 is repeated except that the coating is applied directly to an unpainted e-coated primed surface of the bed. The resulting coating exhibits cohesive failure at a stress of 400 psi (as would be measured by stress applied by an Instron tester to a 6.5 cm2 button adhered to the coated surface with a 2 part-epoxy resin).",
        "It should be understood that the invention is not limited to the exact embodiment or construction, which has been illustrated and described but that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."
