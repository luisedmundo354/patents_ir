        "This application claims the benefits of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/469,289 filed May 9, 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.",
        "Spray devices for the application of liquids onto human skin and hair are well known. Spray applications are used for many types of medicines, hair treatments, deodorants, lotions, and cosmetic agents. One form of spray device for the application of liquids for skin treatment are hand-held spray devices. Usually these hand-held spray devices are comprised of disposable pressurized can spray applicators having a finger actuated spray valve and nozzle. Non-pressurized hand-held spray applicators are also available consisting of reusable trigger-pump spray devices. These disposable and refillable trigger sprayers are held in one hand at less than a meter away from the skin to treat portions of the body. Container sizes for these types of sprayers are adapted to hold volumes of liquids adequate for multiple applications from a single container. Uniform spray applications of a precise dosage or coverage of an entire body are difficult with these types of hand-held spray applicators.",
        "Other types of hand held applicators are those with liquid containers that use liquid pressure or compressed gas for atomization and propulsion. An example of this type of hand-held applicator is a hand-held air-brush sprayer adapted to be used to dispense cosmetic agents. One disadvantage of such air-brush systems is that the liquid containers are of an inappropriate size, often being too large or too small, to coat an entire person or selected parts of a person. In addition, the refilling process for such devices can be messy.",
        "Another disadvantage of hand-held air-brush systems is that it is difficult for a person to self-apply an even coat to certain body portions, such as the back. To overcome this problem, professional salons and spas offer trained sunless-tanning applicator personnel to apply material carefully over the entire body of the customer. This situation is often inconvenient and uncomfortable for both the personnel and the customer. In addition, since hand-held airbrush applications usually take 10 to 30 minutes, the process can be irritating to the tanning applicator and the customer due to prolonged exposure to the spray environment. Fatigue is also known to occur in the back, arms, and wrists of applicator personnel due to the repetitive motion of the hand-held brushing process.",
        "Applications of cosmetic agents, such as sunless tanning compounds, with hand-held spray devices require very experienced personnel to avoid mistakes which may result in under- or over-application, missed areas, streaks, and runs. Another drawback that limits the practicality and marketplace potential of hand-held cosmetic sprays in which an assistant is needed is the potential inconvenience and embarrassment to the person being coated, since they must stand for the duration of the application in an unclothed or partially unclothed state.",
        "Non-hand-held systems for dispensing liquid to the human body have also been developed. U.S. Pat. No. 1,982,509 describes a prior system for applying treatment media to a living body. U.S. Pat. No. 1,982,509 describes a carrier device which moves up and down and provides for applying a treatment media to a body. However, U.S. Pat. No. 1,982,509 does not describe for the use of removable liquid containers, or for liquid containers adapted to be of a size for applying a single dosage to portions of a human body as provided by embodiments of the present invention.",
        "Automated systems for self-application of a spray mist to the entire body have recently been introduced for sunless tanning. These systems are housed within cabinets or booths to permit enclosure of an adult and provide for hands-free, uniform, self-application in a private setting. U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,333 to Laughlin, U.S. Pat. No. 6,387,081 to Cooper, U.S. Pat. No. 6,302,122 to Parker et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 6,443,164 to Parker et al. each describe automated systems for coating the human body in which a spray chamber is used. In present systems, several spray nozzles are fed from a single large tank containing sunless tanning solution. These automatic spray systems are designed to dispense approximately five to ten tanning sessions per liter of liquid, and generally use a feeder-tank capacity of eight to twenty liters. Since each customer's dose is drawn from a common tank, the customer has no assurance of the amount applied, nor do they have a choice of the type of lotion to be applied for a certain skin type or desired tanning color. It is not currently practical to adapt present automatic systems to dispense a single dosage from an individually sized container because of the wasted volume of spray liquid that resides in the many hoses that are required to feed each of the many spray nozzles. The various embodiments of the present invention provide for a self-application spray device having a liquid container closely connected to a nozzle system and of a size allowing a customer to dispense an appropriate volume of spray solution of their choice.",
        "One embodiment of the present invention is directed to a spray device including at least one nozzle and at least one liquid container, the at least one liquid container adapted to hold a volume of spray liquid substantially equal to an amount required to apply a single dosage of the spray liquid for coating the surface of a human body. The spray device further includes a liquid channel adapted to connect the at least one liquid container to the at least one nozzle, and a spray valve adapted to cause the spray liquid to flow from the at least one liquid container to the at least one nozzle using the liquid channel, the at least one nozzle producing a spray jet of the spray liquid. The spray device still further includes a control device adapted to control the operation of the spray device, and sweeping means for sweeping the spray jet from the at least one nozzle to coat at least a portion of the human body.",

        "Referring now to FIG. 1, a spray device adapted to coat a surface of a human body with a spray liquid, such as a sunless tanning compound, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The spray device 505 includes a housing 510 having an attached spray nozzle 515. The spray nozzle 515 includes a jet outlet 520 for dispensing a spray of liquid to cover a portion of a human body. In another embodiment of the present invention, the spray nozzle 515 may be comprised of an electrostatic spray nozzle adapted to produce electrostatically charged droplets of the spray liquid. Many types of electrostatic spray nozzles exist in the prior art, of which many are suitable for use in embodiments of the present invention.",
        "The housing 510 contains a receiver vessel 525 adapted to receive and support an inserted removable liquid container 530. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the removable liquid container 530 is adapted to be disposable or refillable after use. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the receiver vessel 525 may be of a shape so that it mates with the outside shape of the removable liquid container 530 to properly orient the removable liquid container 530 within the receiver vessel 525, as well as ensure that the correct container is used in the spray device 505. Upon insertion of the removable liquid container 530 into the receiver vessel 525, a receiver conduit 535 connected to a liquid valve 540 punctures a liquid seal in the removable liquid container 530. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the removable liquid container 530 is adapted to be of a size to contain an amount of liquid substantially equal to that required to apply a single dosage of the liquid to be sprayed to coat a surface of a human body. For example, this volume may be in the range of 100 ml to 150 ml. The amount of liquid substantially equal to that required to apply a single dosage may vary in accordance with the type of liquid and efficiency of the spray device, for example, between a range of 100 ml to 500 ml. In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the removable liquid container 530 may be adapted to hold a volume of spray liquid of less than one liter. In accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, the removable liquid container 530 may comprise a disposable liquid container or a refillable liquid container.",
        "Upon opening of the liquid valve 540, the liquid in the removable liquid container 530 is allowed to flow through a liquid conduit 545, or a liquid channel, to the spray nozzle 515, and exit the spray nozzle through jet outlet 520 in the form of a liquid spray. The removable liquid container 530 may optionally be pressurized or vented to facilitate the dispensing of liquid from the liquid container 530. In addition, the receiver vessel 525 may be provided with a vent. In accordance with an embodiment of the present embodiment, the spray device 505 further includes a controller 550 connected to the liquid valve 540. In an embodiment of the present invention, the liquid conduit 545 is adapted to be of a length such that the distance that the liquid is required to flow between the liquid valve 540 and the spray nozzle 515 is short. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the length of the liquid conduit 545 is less than approximately 160 millimeters. In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the liquid conduit 545 is adapted to hold less than 20 ml of liquid. At least one advantage provided by the liquid conduit 545 being of a relatively short length and small diameter is that during a single tanning session, sequential use of multiple removable liquid containers can be used without requiring the purging of the liquid conduit 545. For example, a particular customer may desire to have a pre-tanning compound from a first removable liquid container be applied, and then subsequently have a tanning compound from a second removable liquid container be applied.
