No. 7,153,299, which is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/373,539, filed Feb. 24, 2003, now U.S. Pat.

        "The present invention is generally related to an optical thermal mapping device for measuring the intravascular vessel temperature in vivo with high spatial and temperature resolution. More particularly, the present invention relates to an optical thermal mapping device comprising multiple optical fibers with optical gratings for monitoring the thermal distribution of, and detecting and photodynamically treating vulnerable plaques within blood vessels.",
        "Vulnerable plaques are atherosclerotic plaques associated with erosion and ulceration that prone to rupture leading to acute embolization and thrombus. Until recently, physicians believed that most heart attacks were caused by a gradual buildup of atherosclerotic plaque in the arteries of the heart that eventually impeded blood flow. In fact, up to half of all sudden, out-of-hospital cardiac deaths occur in people with no prior diagnosis of heart disease and over two-thirds of heart attack suffers have blockages in their arteries considered to be clinically insignificant in terms of plaque burden and percent stenosis.",
        "Most ruptured plaques are characterized by a large lipid pool and a thin fibrous cap with macrophage infiltration. On the other hand, calcified plaque deposits typically comprise hard material that restricts blood flow in a blood vessel. But, atherosclerotic plaque may also comprise combinations of soft and hard materials. The main difference between a soft vulnerable plaque and a hard stable plaque lies in the risk for a vulnerable plaque to rupture suddenly. The risk of plaque rupture is greatest when the fibrous cap is very thin or the plaque lipid pool is very large.",
        "The buildup of plaque in the blood vessels is sometimes referred to as atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. Atherosclerosis often begins as a small injury to an artery wall. This injury triggers a cascade of injury and response, inflammation, and healing, which may ultimately lead to the narrowing of the artery. It is generally believed that inflammation in an arterial plaque is the result of a series of biochemical and mechanical changes in the arterial wall. The inflammatory cells collect the debris of the damaged tissue resulting in a core of lipid, including macrophages or foam cells and necrotic tissue that is covered by a thin fibrous cap of scar tissue. If the fibrous cap becomes weakened, eroded, or is subjected to excessive mechanical stress, it may rupture and expose the thrombogenic damaged endothelium and metabolic byproducts to the blood stream that causes blood clotting. If the resulting blood clot is severe enough, it may occlude the artery. If this obstruction persists in a coronary artery, a myocardial infarction or angina may result.",
        "Many vulnerable plaque deposits do not obstruct the flow of blood through the blood vessels. Vulnerable plaques are often undetectable using conventional techniques such as angiography. However, a plaque may rupture suddenly and form a blood clot in the blood vessel lumen causing a blockage and causes heart attack and death. Recently, inflammation has been recognized being associated with the formation and progression of vulnerable plaques. An increase in tissue temperature at a lesion is thought to be caused by the response of the immune system to inflammation and an increase in metabolic activity involved in the healing process. It has been observed that the inflamed necrotic core of a vulnerable plaque maintains itself at a temperature which may be a fraction of a degree to a few degrees higher than the surrounding tissue. Vulnerable plaques are generally characterized by hemodynamically insignificant, variable in size, not calcified, and undetectable with standard anatomic imaging methods.",
        "The inability of common diagnostic methodologies, such as coronary angiography that is the current gold standard technique for diagnosing coronary vessel obstructions, to detect vulnerable plaque has led to a major rush to develop new methods to detect, characterize and treat patients with these types of deposits. Unlike the typical occlusive atherosclerotic lesion, vulnerable plaque deposits are associated with a compensatory enlargement of the vessel wall known as positive lumen remodeling. Selected intravascular imaging techniques for vulnerable plaque include angioscopy, intravascular ultrasound, thermography, optical coherence tomography, elastography, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear imaging, electrical impedance imaging, shear stress imaging, photonic spectroscopy, and the like. Among them, catheter-based intravascular thermography is the most promising one, which is based on the premise that vulnerable plaques are hotter than surrounding normal tissue and that by measuring these temperature elevation, physicians can determine the exact location and extent of disease.",
        "Casscells and associates (Current Opinion in Cardiology 2002; 17:656-662) reported mechanism of heat production in atherosclerotic plaques by a high metabolic rate in the areas of macrophage accumulation, of which a sub-population strongly expresses mitochondrial uncoupling proteins. The uncoupling proteins are homologs of thermogenin, which is responsible for thermogenesis in brown fat tissue. Further, they measured temperature of living samples with a thermistor and found that plaques showed several regions in which the surface temperatures varied reproducibly by 0.2\u00b0 C. to 0.3\u00b0 C. Infrared thermographic images also revealed heterogeneity in temperature among the plaques.",

        "Optical fibers are hair thin strands of glass or plastic that guide light. The optical fiber has an inner core surrounded by an outer cladding. In order to guide light, the core refractive index is higher than the cladding index. A fiber grating, which the periodic structure of the refractive index is formed inside the core of a fiber, is widely used in the field of fiber-optic communication for wavelength management. The optical grating reflects or transmits a certain portion, wavelength (bandwidth) or intensity, of the light along optical fibers. A fiber Bragg grating is based on the interference of multiple reflection of a light beam in a fiber segment whose index of refraction varies periodically along the length of the fiber. Variations of the refractive index constitute discontinuities that emulate a Bragg structure. If the spacing of the index periods is equal to one half -of the wavelength of the light, then the waves will interfere constructively (the round trip of each reflected wave is one wavelength) and a large reflection will occur from the periodic array. Optical signals whose wavelengths are not equal to one half the spacing will travel through the periodic array unaffected.",
        "A periodic variation of the refractive index is formed by exposing the core, such as germanosilicate, of the fiber to an intense ultraviolet (UV) optical interference pattern or mask that has a periodicity equal to the periodicity of the grating to be formed. When the fiber is exposed to an intensive UV pattern, structural defects are formed and thus a permanent variation of the refractive indexes having the same periodicity with the UV pattern. The condition for strong reflection of Bragg wavelength is \u03bb=2\u00d7n\u00d7d. Where n is the effective refractive index, and d is Bragg spacing or grating period. Both n and d change with changes in temperature due to thermal-optic and thermal expansion effects.",
        "The merits of optical fiber sensors include immunity to electromagnetic interference, high flexibility, remote sensing capability, smaller size of sensing element, lightweight, little thermal/electric conductivity, and easy to fabricate. Optical fiber sensors have been developed for chemical, strain, temperature and pressure sensing, and smart structure inspection. Various fiber-grating configurations have been developed for sensor application. Depending on its configuration, in general, it can be classified as direct and indirect sensors. Direct sensors measure the environmental effects surrounding the grating. Indirect sensors measure the environmental effects at the tip of the fiber and use fiber grating for wavelength management. The sensing signal is obtained through either a transmission or reflection mode. In some aspect of the present invention, it is provided direct fiber grating as direct sensors in a reflection mode.",
        "Fiber gratings reflect light of particular bandwidth, and can act as high-performance optical thermal sensor. The reflected bandwidths are extremely narrow because of the long path lengths possible in optical fibers. Therefore, a minute temperature change surrounding the fibers changes the effective refractive index and grating's periods, thus modulating their reflective wavelength or intensity. When multiple gratings are created in an optic fiber, a multi-point sensor can be monitored simultaneously.",
        "Fiber-grating technologies have been proven and demonstrated with excellent sensing abilities for temperature, pressure, stress and various chemicals detection. They also exhibit extremely long-term stability, and minimal optical losses. Several prior art devices have been described for the performance of a number of optical fiber grating sensors. U.S. Pat.

        "Optic Fiber Grating",
        "The advantages of using fiberoptic sensors for medical applications are well known. The non-conductive nature of both quartz and plastic fibers makes them ideal for electrical safety and for non-perturbing use in radiofrequency and microwave environments. Further, when measuring the tissue temperature on an inner wall of a blood vessel, the temperature measured by a non-conductive fiberoptic sensor reflects about the real tissue temperature whereas the temperature measured by a conductive thermocouple or thermister is compromised by the flowing blood stream of the blood vessel. Some aspects of the present invention relate to a basket catheter system having a plurality of expandable basket optic fiber arms, each fiber having a tissue-contacting region and a blood-contacting region, wherein the grating surface is limited to the tissue-contacting region for enhancing the temperature measurement sensitivity. In one embodiment, the blood-contacting region of the optic fiber is not grated. In another embodiment, the blood-contacting region was grated, but insulated or covered thereafter.",
        "The optic fiber grating principles are briefly described herein for reference. The creation of high performance optical components by photolithographically writing periodic variations in the refractive index\u2014\u201cBragg grating\u201d\u2014directly into the cores of conventional silica-based fibers. Regardless of the method used, the interference pattern must be of high quality, with uniform periodicity, high contrast, and sharp edges. The UV periodicity, as shown in FIG. 1, is formed by means of one of several optical methods (for example, UV mask, diffraction, interferometry, or the like) that generate an interference pattern of alternating minima and maxima of light intensity. The UV source 20 is provided by an excimer laser that operates at a wavelength in the 157-351 nm. The UV or near UV light pattern transmits through the cladding 30 and creates an index perturbation (\u0394n) 31 with a periodicity 32 in the core 40 of the fiber 10 that depends on the wavelength band in which the grating is designed to operate.",
        "The grating reflectivity, R, for a given mode at enter wavelength (\u03bb) is given by\n\nR=tan h2[L\u0394n\u03b7(V)/\u03bb]",
        "Where L is the length of the grating, \u0394n is the magnitude of index perturbation, and \u03b7(V) a function of fiber parameter V that represents the fraction of the integrated mode intensity contained in the core 40. The core diameter of the single mode fiber is typically less than 10 \u03bcm, while the total fiber diameter is approximately 0.1-2 mm. A smaller optic fiber of less than 100 \u03bcm may also be useful in certain medical applications.",
        "Multiplexing of several grating 51, 52, 53, 54, as shown in FIG. 2, written in the same fiber 10 allows the creation of a distributed sensor capable of measuring the spatial profile of a temperature quantity. Each grating 51, 52, 53, 54, fabricated with different periodicity 32, reflects a specific wavelength. For illustration purposes, when a light beam 91 (with \u03bb1 to \u03bb5) from a broadband light source, an ultra wideband light source, or multiple-wavelength light source 98 (shown in FIG. 6) is input into the fiber, the multiple gratings reflect a first portion 92 (\u03bb1 to \u03bb4) and transmit a second portion 93 (\u03bb5) of the light depending on the effective index of the grating. Therefore, by monitoring the shift of a specific reflected wavelength, for example, as shown in grating 2 of the FIG. 3, the local temperature in the vessel wall at that grating can be correlatively measured externally. The total length of each grating is about 1 to 5 mm, and the reflectivity can be greater than \u221220 db. FIG. 4 shows an example of the correlated wavelength shift versus temperature at 37\u00b0 C. in the range of human body temperature. The actual correlative relationship between the wavelength shift and the temperature of a specific fiber device system could be calibrated and established when the fibers are in a simulated operating shape, configuration and conditions.",
        "The temperature resolution of the intrinsic silica core fiber Bragg grating is approximately 0.01 nm/\u00b0 C. To obtain a resolution of 0.1\u00b0 C., the spectrum analyzer must resolve the shift of the reflected wavelength to an accuracy of about 0.001 nm. Various methods are commonly used to increase temperature resolution. The first method is to apply temperature sensitive materials or polymers, such as PMMA, onto the cladding 30 at grating area, thus leads to a large temperature change or a larger temperature coefficient (\u0394n/\u0394T). The second method to enhance the temperature resolution is to use long-period grating. For typical Bragg grating, the grating periodicity (d) 32 is 0.5-10 \u03bcm, while for long period fiber grating (LPG), the periodicity can be as large as several hundred micrometers. The larger grating periodicity, d, in LPG will lead to a larger wavelength shift, \u0394\u03bb The higher order resonant peaks of LPG are very sensitive to its ambient refractive index. The wavelength shift of long period grating can be two to three orders of magnitude larger than that of Bragg grating. An LPG-based temperature sensor can easily achieve a resolution of about 0.001\u00b0 C.",

A 6 French catheter or smaller with an expandable and externally controllable basket arrangement 21 can support 4 to 10 fibers depending on the design dimension and configuration. One method to deploy and radially expand the optical fiber basket is to utilize a highly flexible pulling wire 23 (also shown in FIG. 8A). In one embodiment, the tip 85 of the pulling wire 23 is secured to the tip bundle 83 of the flexible optical fibers 50, 60, 70, 80.",
        "To enhance the outward expansion property, the optical fibers may suitably be slightly preshaped. In some aspect of the present invention, the basket catheter may comprise an inflatable balloon sized and configured to expand the fibers radially outward during the deployment and temperature sensing state. In one further aspect of the present invention, each of the fibers may be supported intimately by an expandable wire during the deployment and temperature sensing state. The basket catheter 19 permits good thermal contact of the optical grating elements on the optical fiber with the arterial wall. Each optical fiber sensors (that is, optical grating elements) are sized, configured and suitably located on the optical fiber enabling optimal contact with the target inner surface of a blood vessel, allowing monitoring of temperature upon expansion and in contact with the vulnerable plaque. The total sensing length in each fiber is approximately 2-5 cm. The length of the optical fiber is comparable to the length of the catheter. By using an optical thermal basket catheter system, it does not need to drag the catheter for mapping a whole region of interest.",
        "The optical thermal basket catheter system, as shown in FIG. 6, is integrated with a light source 98, a fiber splitting coupler 94, wavelength diffraction elements 96, and an optical signal detection system 97. Light from a broadband light-emitting diode (LED) or an ultra wideband light source travels through a single-mode fiber 50 to reach the grating 51, 52, 53, 54. Diode lasers, such as broadband diode lasers (1.3-1.55 \u03bcm) that cover the fiber communication wavelengths, are also available. Some lamp sources, such as a tungsten lamp, which are broadband light sources that cover the entire near infrared range, are also suitable as a continuous light source. Though the light source has a broad bandwidth; the reflected light from the grating is relatively narrow. The reflected light propagates back in the same fiber 50 and is coupled into a detection fiber by an optical coupler 94. Optical fiber couplers are used extensively in optical fiber communication systems. The most common couplers are fused fiber and directional coupler, which split the optical signal from one fiber into two fibers with different intensity ratio. The signal demultiplexing is constructed with a focusing/collimating lens 95, a diffraction grating 96, and a two dimensional CCD (charge coupled device) array 97.",
        "The spectral peaks associated with each grating are physically separated by the diffraction grating 96 and illuminated on the CCD 97. The movement of the peak on CCD is related to the peak shift due to temperature change originated from fiber grating. When multiple signal fibers are aligned linearly in front of the entrance of the diffraction grating 96, a 2-D CCD provides the ability to simultaneously monitor multiple reflection spectra from multiple fibers. The detector 97 is interfaced through an analog-to-digital converter to an advanced signal processor in a computer. The real-time data acquisition software supports digital processing with a thermal resolution of 0.001\u00b0 C. The temperature distributions obtained from the multiple sensors offer a thermographic mapping of the entire vessel walls. The circumferential and longitudinal thermal profiles of the vessel wall can also be displayed. The system is calibrated under simulated operating conditions to remove other non-thermal effects. In general, the data acquisition and analysis of the optical parameters are well known to an ordinary person who is skilled in the art.",

        "Every year, more than one million people in the United States experience a sudden cardiac event (acute coronary syndromes and/or sudden cardiac death). Though a large portion of this population has no prior symptom, a thrombus identifies a culprit plaque that might be ruptured or nonruptured. Plaque rupture is the most common type of plaque complication, accounting for about 70% of fatal acute myocardial infarctions and/or sudden coronary death (Circulation 2003;108:1664-1672 and Circulation 2003;108:1772-1778). The vulnerable plaque considered responsible for acute coronary events based on retrospective autopsy studies had a large lipid pool, a thin cap, and macrophage-dense inflammation on or beneath its surface.",
        "The risk of plaque rupture is related to two factors: the intrinsic individual plaque character that influences vulnerability and an extrinsic force triggering plaque disruption (Reviews in Cardiovascular Medicine 2004;5(suppl 2):S22-S33). Because angiography provides only a contrast-filled luminal silhouette, it tends to underestimate the severity of coronary atherosclerosis. Accordingly, the development of novel imaging techniques has become one of the most important research areas in the field of vulnerable plaque. Some imaging techniques for detection of vulnerable plaque include intravascular ultrasound, angioscopy, optical coherence tomography, thermography, spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, serum markers, and others.",

Photodynamic therapy is a unique modality that combines systemic and local approaches to inhibit plaque formation, cause plaque regress, and enable the diagnosis and stabilization of vulnerable plaque. This approach involves the combination of a chemical photosensitizer and visible light at a specific wavelength to selectively illuminate and activate the photosensitizer, thus leading to the production of singlet radical oxygen species, which mediates apoptosis. A previous animal study has demonstrated that motexafin lutetium, a photosensitizer derived from the porphyrin molecule, binds LDL receptors and is transported into microphage-rich plaque. In the same study, a significant decrease in macrophages and a mild decrease in atheroma were observed without damage to the normal vessel wall in the area of photoactivation (Cardiovascular Research 2001;49:449-455).",
        "Photosensitive tumor-seeking drugs with a strong absorption and large fluorescence quantum yield in the far visible or near infrared regions have become available. Ho et al. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,660,181, entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, discloses an apparatus for in-depth three dimensional tumor mapping including (A) a light source; (B) a multi-fiber bundle including at least one illumination fiber and at least two receiving fibers, the at least one illumination fiber being connected to the light source; (C) a spectrometer connected to the at least two receiving fibers; and (D) a hybrid neural network connected to the spectrometer, the hybrid neural network including a principle component analysis processor and a neural network classifier. The characteristic spectral signature of these photosensitized drugs can improve early cancer diagnosis. Because near-infrared light can penetrate much deeper into tissue than visible and ultraviolet light, the use of such drugs makes possible tissue diagnosis at a significantly greater depth than was previously accessible.",

        "It is one object of the present invention to provide an optical apparatus for treating tissue comprising a light emitting optic fiber for providing desired light energy to initiate photodynamic therapy onto the photosensitized tissue, such as vulnerable plaque. In one embodiment, the optical apparatus has both diagnostic and therapeutic functions. Some aspects of the invention provide an optical apparatus for treating tissue of a patient comprising: an elongate tubular element having a lumen, a distal end, and a proximal end; a support scaffold structure deployable out of the distal end of the tubular element, wherein the support scaffold structure comprises a plurality of basket arms extendable outwardly for fixing/stabilizing the support scaffold in place when deployed, the support scaffold structure comprises at least one optical fiber that emits light; and a light source having a light beam, wherein the light beam is coupled into the at least one optical fiber.",
        "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment that uses a drug, called a photosensitizer or photosensitizing agent, and a particular type of light. When photosensitizers are exposed to a specific wavelength of light, they produce a form of oxygen that kills nearby cells. Each photosensitizer is activated by light of a specific wavelength. This wavelength determines how far the light can travel into the body. Thus, doctors use specific photosensitizers and wavelengths of light to treat different areas of the body with PDT. In the first step of PDT for tissue treatment, a photosensitizing agent is injected into the bloodstream. The agent is absorbed by cells all over the body, but may stay in particular cells longer than it does in normal cells. At some specific period after injection, the target tissue is exposed to light. The photosensitizer in the target tissue absorbs the light and produces an active form of oxygen that destroys nearby undesired cells. The light used for PDT can come from a laser or other sources of light. Laser light can be directed through an optical fiber to deliver light to areas inside the body. For example, a fiber optic cable can be inserted through an endoscope (a thin, lighted tube used to look at tissues inside the body) into the lungs or esophagus to treat cancer in these organs. Other light sources include light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which may be used for surface tumors, such as skin cancer.",

        "U.S. Pat. No. 6,054,449, entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, discloses a method for employing photoactivatable compounds for diagnosing such diseases as atherosclerosis, restenosis, cancer, cancer precursors, noncancerous hyperproliferative diseases, psoriasis, macular degeneration, glaucoma and viruses. Photodynamic therapy has been applied in cardiovascular medicine for at least two broad indications: treatment of atherosclerosis and inhibition of restenosis due to intimal hyperplasia after vascular interventions. Hematoporphyrin derivative was the first of a number of photosensitizers with demonstrable, selective accumulation within atheromatous plaques. Subsequent studies have underscored the affinity of porphyrin derivatives for atheromatous plaques in rabbits and miniswine. Hematoporphyrin and its derivatives provide a new aid for detection of malignant disease and atheromatous plaques because they tend to accumulate in malignant/atheromatous tissue with subsequent red fluorescence for optical viewing (J Thoracic and Cardiovasc Surg 1961;42:623-629).",
        "Ho et al. reported (SPIE 1996; 2675: 89-98) a photodynamic drug detection system for measurement of drug uptake. (Most photodynamic drugs emit strong fluorescence at near infrared region.

Since tumor and plaque tend to have higher metabolic rate, the drug concentration is higher in these areas. Therefore, photodynamic drug offers an optical method for localize tumors or plaque.) The system uses near infrared laser excitation, a special fiber configuration and long wavelength 680 nm fluorescence analysis to monitor the drug concentration in tissue in real time. Some aspects of the present invention relate to an optic fiber basket catheter with the photodynamic drug detection system for monitoring the drug (for example, photosensitizers) concentration in plaque tissue.",

        "Yock at 2003 TCT meeting in Washington, D.C., reported photodynamic modulation of vulnerable plaque with antrin (that is, motexafin lutetium) in animal and clinical studies. Motexafin lutetium is excitable by light at about a wavelength of 740 nm that penetrates tissue and is water soluble with short plasma half life and no significant phototoxicity. Further, it is preferentially absorbed by atheromatous plaque. Animal study data indicate that motexafin lutetium localizes in atheromatous plaque and in intimal hyperplasia, variably reduces plaque in rabbit models of atherosclerosis, reduces intimal hyperplasia in rat models, and consistently depletes macrophages across animal models. The clinical implications are: reducing plaque cellularity would have a positive effect on restenosis; and a preferential uptake by macrophages could mean stabilization of vulnerable plaque. Some aspects of the invention relate to a method of diagnosing and photodynamically treating vulnerable plaque comprising using a basket type support scaffold catheter with light irradiating capability for desired photodynamic therapy.",

Once the region of vulnerable plaque at the target tissue is confirmed, the therapeutic function of the apparatus is activated to provide photodynamic light energy to activate the needed photodynamic therapy. The remaining or surrounding tissue outside the irradiation zone would not go through the photodynamic therapy due to the absence of the activating light wavelength.
