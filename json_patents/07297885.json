        "This is a Continuation-In-Part application of applicant's former patent application with application Ser. No. 11/212,757, filed on Aug. 29, 2005, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,112,753.",
        "A conventional pressure switch 9 is shown in FIG. 9 and generally includes a push member 91, a first plate 92, a second plate 93, a first contact point 94, a second contact point 95, a spring member 96 and a rectangular box 97 which receives all the parts therein. When the pressure of water is too low, the pump can be automatically activated to maintain a desired pressure in pipes.",
        "When the pressure of water is high, the push member 91 pushes the first plate 92 which drives the second plate 93 and the first contact point 94 is moved by the second plate 93 to be separated from the second contact point 95 so as to stop the pump.",
        "When the water pressure in pipes is lowered and smaller than the spring force of the spring member 96 in the pressure switch 9, the spring member 96 drives the two contact points 94, 95 to be in contact with each other to activate the pump.",
        "However, when the direction of water flow form the inlet 98 and the swing direction of the first contact point 94 need a certain space to work so that the box 97 has to be large enough to receive all the parts therein. Besides, the inlet 98 is located off from the center of the box 97 so that it requires a larger space to install the box 97.",
        "The present invention intends to provide a pressure switch wherein the direction of water flow form the inlet and the swing direction of the contact point are the same so that the box can be a cylindrical box and the inlet is located at the central axis of the box. This reduces the manufacturing cost.",
        "The present invention relates to a pressure switch which comprises a box and an outer cover is connected to an open end of the box and an inlet is defined through the outer cover, an inner cover is engaged with the open end and has a central hole. A film is located between the outer cover and the inner cover, and has a push portion which extends through the inner cover. An initializing device has a rod and a first spring which is mounted to the rod and one end of the rod extends through a close end of the box. A first plate has a pivot end pivotably connected to the inner cover and a through hole is defined through the first plate. The first plate is located between the first spring and the push portion. A mounting hole is defined through the first plate so that the rod extends through the mounting hole. A second plate extends through the through hole of the first plate and has a pivotal end which is located opposite to the pivot end of the first plate and connected to the inner cover. An activation device is located above the first and second plates and includes a frame and a pull rod which is connected to a center of the frame. A second spring member is connected between a lug of the second plate and the pull rod. A first contact unit and a second contact unit are located on two sides of the pull rod and connected to the frame. When the pull rod is pulled by the second spring, the first and second contact units are in contact with each other.",

An outer cover 2 is connected to the open end 13 of the box 1 and an inlet 21 is defined through the outer cover 2 so as to introduce water into the box 1. An inner cover 3 is engaged with the open end 13 and has a central hole 31. A film 4 is located between the outer cover 2 and the inner cover 3, and has a push portion 41 which extends through the central hole 31 of the inner cover 3.",

An adjustment member 53 is threadedly connected to the rod 51 and located above the first spring 52. The rod 51 has one end extending through a hole 64 in the close end 12 of the box 1 and is connected to a nut 54. The other end of the rod 51 is connected to the inner cover 3.",

The first plate 6 includes two openings 63 so that a tip of the push portion 41 may extend therethrough. A second plate 7 extends through the through hole 62 of the first plate 6 and has a pivotal end 71 which is located opposite to the pivot end 61 of the first plate 6 and connected to the inner cover 3.",
        "An activation device 8 is located above the first and second plates 6, 7 and including a frame 81 and a pull rod 82 which is connected to a center of the frame 81. A second spring member 83 is connected between a lug 72 located at a center of the second plate 7 and the pull rod 82. A first contact unit 84 and a second contact unit 85 are located on two sides of the pull rod 82 and connected to the frame 81. The frame 81 includes two tip portions 811, 812 with the pull rod 82 located therebetween, the two tip portions 811, 812 respectively contact the first contact unit 84 and the second contact unit 85.",
        "In order to reinforce the spring force that is applied to the first plate 6, a third spring 55 is mounted to the rod 51 and located at inner periphery of the first spring 52. Each of the first and second plates 6, 7 has a hook hole 65/73 so that a fourth spring 74 is hooked the two respective hook holes 65, 73 in the first and second plates 6, 7.",

The electrical wires 88 of the first and second contact units 84, 85 are powered so as to activate the pump which is not shown.",
        "When the water pressure is larger than the force of the first spring 52, the push portion 41 of the film 4 is pushed inward to push the first plate 6 and pivots the second plate 7 upward. The pull rod 82 connected to the lug 72 on the second plate 7 an the second plate 7 both push the frame 81 so that the first and second upper contact portions 841, 851 are separated from the first and second lower contact portions 842, 852. The fifth and sixth springs 86, 87 bounce back to ensure all the contact portions are separated to stop the pump.",
        "The two tip portions 811, 812 are in contact with the two respective centers of the first contact unit 84 and the second contact unit 85 so that the first and second contact units 84 and 85 apply an even force which prevents the pressure switch from shaking. The direction of the water flow from the inlet 21 and the direction of the movement of the fist and second contact units 84, 85 are the same, so that only a smaller space is needed and the inlet 21 is located at a center of the box 1 which is convenience for installation.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 7 and 8 which show a second embodiment of the present invention wherein the activation device 8A is located between the space 11A and the second plate 7A, and includes a push rod 82A which has one end connected to a frame 81A guided by rails 88A. The other end of the push rod 82A is in contact with the lug 72A of the second plate 7A.

The second upper contact portion 851A is in contact with the second lower contact portion 852A. By the spring forces of the fifth spring 86A and the sixth spring 87A, the first upper contact portion 841A of the first contact unit 84A is in contact with the first lower contact portion 842A, and the second upper contact portion 851A of the second contact unit 86A is in contact with the second lower contact portion 852A. By this way, the circuit is connected between the first and second contact units 84A, 85A so that the pump is activated.",
