        "The present invention relates to the stabilization of a pharmaceutically active ingredient sensitive to oxidation, e.g. a poly-ene macrolide, preferably a poly-ene macrolide having immunosuppressant properties, particularly rapamycins.",
        "The handling and storage particularly in the bulk form of pharmaceutically active ingredients which are sensitive to oxidation is difficult. Special handling is necessary and often the oxidation-sensitive ingredient is stored in air-tight packaging under protective gas. Substantial amounts of stabilizers are added during the formulating process of such pharmaceutically active ingredients.",
        "Poly-ene macrolides have satisfactory stability properties. However, it has now been found that their stability to oxygen may substantially be improved by the addition of a stabilizer, e.g. an antioxidant, during their isolation step.",
        "According to the invention, there is provided\n\n    1. A process for stabilizing a poly-ene macrolide comprising adding an antioxidant to the purified macrolide, preferably at the commencement of its isolation step.\n    \n        This process is particularly useful for the production of a stabilized poly-ene macrolide in bulk. The amount of antioxidant may conveniently be up to 1%, more preferably from 0.01 to 0.5% (based on the weight of the macrolide). Such a small amount is referred to hereinafter as a catalytic amount.",

Use of a mixture as defined above in 2, in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition.",
        "Examples of poly-enes macrolides are e.g. molecules comprising double bonds, preferably conjugated double bonds, for example such having antibiotic and/or immunosuppressant properties, e.g. macrolides comprising a lactam or lactone bond and their derivatives, e.g. compounds which have a biological activity qualitatively similar to that of the natural macrolide, e.g. chemically substituted macrolides. Suitable examples include e.g. rapamycins and ascomycins. A preferred poly-ene macrolide is a macrolide comprising at least 2 conjugated double bonds, e.g. 3 conjugated double bonds.",
        "Rapamycin is a known lactam macrolide produceable, for example by Streptomyces hygroscopicus. The structure of rapamycin is given in Kessler, H. et al.; 1993; Helv. Chim. Acta, 76: 117. Rapamycin has antibiotic and immunosuppressant properties. Derivatives of rapamycin are known, e.g. 16-O-substituted rapamycins, for example as disclosed in U.S. Pat.

        "Ascomycins, of which FK-506 and ascomycin are the best known, form another class of lactam macrolides, many of which have potent immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory activity. FK506 is a lactam macrolide produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis. The structure of FK506 is given in the Appendix to the Merck Index, 11 th ed. (1989) as item A5. Ascomycin is described e.g. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,244,592.

The macrolide is preferably in a purified state. It may be dissolved in an inert solvent and the antioxidant is added to the resulting solution, followed by a precipitation step of the stabilized macrolide, e.g. in an amorphous form or in the form of crystals. Preferably the mixture of the invention is in amorphous form.",
        "The resulting stabilized macrolide exhibits surprisingly an improved stability to oxidation and its handling and storage, e.g. in bulk form prior to its further processing for example into a galenic composition, become much easier. It is particularly interesting for macrolides in amorphous form.",

        "The compositions of the invention are useful for the indications as known for the macrolide they contain at e.g. known dosages. For example, when the macrolide has immunosuppressant properties, e.g. rapamycin or a rapamycin derivative, the composition may be useful e.g. in the treatment or prevention of organ or tissue acute or chronic allo or xeno-transplant rejection, autoimmune diseases or inflammatory conditions, asthma, proliferative disorders, e.g tumors, or hyperproliferative vascular disorders, preferably in the prevention or treatment of transplant rejection.",
        "The amount of macrolide and of the composition to be administered depend on a number of factors, e.g. the active ingredient used, the conditions to be treated, the duration of the treatment etc. For e.g. rapamycin or 40-O-(2-hydroxy)ethyl-rapamycin, a suitable daily dosage form for oral administration comprise from 0.1 to 10 mg, to be administered once or in divided form.",
