        "1. Field of Invention",
        "The invention disclosed herein relates generally to an apparatus for simulating interdental papilla between dental implants. More specifically, preferred embodiments of the disclosed invention relate to a papilla tack for supporting gingival tissues between osseointegrated dental implants.",
        "2. Description of the Prior Art",
        "It is known in the art to use dental implants to replace human teeth. Under circumstances known in the art, there are cases when multiple dental implants are used to replace multiple human teeth. The dental implants are anchored into the bone of the jaw and are referenced as osseointegrated dental implants. A problem occurs when multiple dental implants are adjacent one another, replacing adjacent teeth. Healthy teeth are usually surrounded by healthy gingival tissues appearing papilla-like to an onlooker. However, in the case of adjacent dental implants, the interdental gingival tissue is flat, leaving a visible embrasure between the teeth. This embrasure is not aesthetically pleasing for onlookers, and the open embrasure is a give away that dental implants are being utilized in place of real teeth. This is quite embarrassing for individuals having dental implants and presents additional problems as well (e.g. food can get stuck in the embrasure). What is needed is an apparatus for simulating interdental papilla to increase the aesthetic appeal of the interdental region and to minimize any embarrassment and/or discomfort that might be felt by the individual having the dental implants.",
        "Disclosed herein is an apparatus for simulating interdental papilla. The preferred apparatus preferably comprises a base, a front stabilizing pin and a rear stabilizing pin. The base is preferably sized to be positioned between osseointegrated dental implants within an interdental embrasure and beneath at least a portion of the interdental gingival tissue. In some aspects, the apparatus for simulating interdental papilla comprises a papilla tack.",
        "The base preferably comprises a bottom surface, a left side surface, a right side surface and a top surface.

The top surface is preferably defined by the front bottom edge, the rear bottom edge, the left curved edge and the right curved edge.",
        "The base is preferably characterized by dimensions comprising a top width, a bottom width, a length and a height. The top width, preferably measured at a highest point of the base, is preferably about one half millimeter. The bottom width is preferably about three times the top width, and more preferably about one and one half millimeters. The length is preferably about six times the top width, and more preferably about three millimeters. The height is preferably about three times the top width, and more preferably about one and one half millimeters.",
        "The rear stabilizing pin and the front stabilizing pin preferably extend downwardly from the base for securing the base to an interimplant bone. Each of the front and rear stabilizing pins preferably comprise a substantially triangular plane joining with the bottom surface at an edge of the substantially triangular plane.

        "With principal reference to FIG. 1f, the enclosed area of top surface 150 is preferably defined by front bottom edge 126, rear bottom edge 128, left curved edge 132 and right curved edge 142. As shown, top surface 150 curves along with left curved edge 132 and right curved edge 142, preferably reaching height H approximately half way along length L. As shown in FIGS. 1a through 1b, preferred embodiments of base 110 appears substantially trapezoidal from front and rear views.",
        "Base 110 is preferably sized to be positioned between osseointegrated dental implants, within an interdental embrasure and beneath at least a portion of the interdental gingival tissue. In addition to length L and height H, the dimensions of base 110 preferably also includes a top width TW measured at the highest point of base 110. Top width TW is preferably measured across top surface 150 half way along length L. Furthermore, the dimensions of base 110 preferably include a bottom width BW, which is about three times top width TW. In preferred embodiments, length L is about six times top width TW, height H is about three times top width TW and bottom width BW is about three times top width TW. More preferably, top width TW is about one half millimeter, bottom width BW is about one and one half millimeters, length L is about three millimeters and height H is about one and one half millimeters.",
        "Base 110 is the preferred embodiment of support means for supporting interdental gingival tissue. However, a base of any suitable shape and/or other dental scaffolding can be used to support the interdental tissue. Any suitable support means can be utilized so long as it supports interdental gingival tissue in a manner such as to simulate the appearance of an interdental papilla.",
        "Continuing with reference to FIGS. 1a through 1d, base 110 preferably includes front stabilizing pin 105a and rear stabilizing pin 105b, both preferably extending downward from bottom surface 120. Each of front stabilizing pin 105a and rear stabilizing pin 105b preferably define an angle of ninety degrees with respect to bottom surface 120. In preferred embodiments, each of front stabilizing pin 105a and rear stabilizing pin 105b comprise a substantially triangular plane sharing an edge of the triangle with bottom surface 120. Furthermore, each of front stabilizing pin 105a and rear stabilizing pin 105b have a hardness and sharpness of a magnitude such that each is adapted to be anchored into the interimplant bone.",
        "At least one stabilizing pin 105 is a preferred means for securing the supporting means (the base, other means, etc.) to an interimplant bone. Stabilizing pins 105 of any suitable shape can be utilized. Any suitable securing means (glue, clamp, etc.) can be utilized so long as it secures the supporting means in a manner such as to simulate the appearance of an interdental papilla.",
        "With principal reference to FIGS. 2a, a pair of osseointegrated dental implants are shown with an open embrasure 200 between the dental implants. The gingival tissue 210 is located between the dental implants. However, absent implantation of papilla tack 100, interdental gingival tissue 210 is typically unraised and fails to maintain a papilla-like appearance.",
        "With principal reference to FIG. 2b, a pair of osseointegrated dental implants are shown with an embodiment of papilla tack 100 implanted there between. Using stabilizing pins 105 or other securing means, papilla tack 100 is anchored into the bone between the dental implants either at the time of dental implant placement or in a subsequent surgical intervention. Papilla tack is preferably implanted beneath the interdental gingival tissues 210, forcing interdental gingival tissue 210 outward.",
        "Papilla tack 100 provides support for interdental gingival tissue 210, such support not otherwise being present. This provides an appearance between the two dental implants of an interdental embrasure 200 that is filled with normal gingival tissue. Base 110 (and/or other support means) provides a scaffolding for interimplant gingival tissue 210 over a prolonged period of time, while stabilizing pins 105 (and/or other securing means) anchor the base and/or other support means to the implant bone.",
        "Although there has been hereinabove described an apparatus for simulating interdental papilla, in accordance with the present invention, for the purposes of illustrating the manner in which the invention may be used to advantage it should be appreciated that the invention is not limited thereto. Accordingly, any and all modifications, variations, or equivalent arrangements which may occur to one skilled in the art should be considered to be within the scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims."
