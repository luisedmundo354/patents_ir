        "The present invention relates in a first aspect to a control system for a powered vehicle.",
        "In a second aspect the present invention relates to a method of controlling a movement of a powered vehicle.",
        "In a third aspect the present invention relates to at least one computer program product for controlling a movement of a powered vehicle.",
        "The theatre has automated much of the equipment used for movement of scenery and lighting. Most of stage activity involves simply moving scenery about the stage. Automated systems for doing this have been limited by poor radio communication, lack of accuracy and navigation, high noise and high costs.",
        "The document U.S. Pat. No. 5,823,884 discloses a powered stage wagon comprising a chassis to which there is mounted a plurality of rolling support means, each of which is located at respective corner of the chassis. The powered stage wagon also comprises a first and a second drive means, both mounted on the chassis in engagement with the surface over which the stage wagon is to move and are mutually spaced. The document describes a method of calculating a travel path along which the stage wagon may be moved from a current position to a desired position. The method comprising the steps of calculating for each of said drive means the bisector of a line joining the current location of said drive means and the location of said drive means when the stage wagon has moved to its desired position; determining the point of intersection of the two bisectors; calculating for each of said drive means the length of an arc centred on said point of intersection and passing through both the current location of said drive means and the location of said drive means when the stage wagon has moved to its desired position; controlling the ratio of the rotational speeds of the first and second drive means in accordance with the ratio of said arc lengths; and controlling the relative orientation of said first and second drive means so that each of said drive means continuously defines a tangent to the respective arc associated with the drive means concerned.",
        "One main disadvantage with the method of calculating a travel path according to the document U.S. Pat. No. 5,823,884 is that it limits paths to certain predefined combinations of translation and rotation. Another disadvantage is that the method does not correct for any physical errors in movement that might occur.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to solve the above mentioned problems.",
        "According to the present invention there is provided in a first aspect a control system for a powered vehicle for describing a desired movement of said vehicle, and communicating said movement to a drive system of said vehicle. The powered vehicle comprising a chassis, at least three rolling means mounted on said chassis for engagement with a surface over which said vehicle is to move. The drive system comprises at least two drive units, each comprising a first driving means and a second driving means, co-operatively operable to provide both propulsion and steering of said drive unit and consequently said vehicle. The control system also comprises a computing means for calculating a desired movement of said vehicle, wherein translation of said vehicle is calculated in said form of a continuous cubic function, and rotation of said vehicle is calculated in the form of a linear function. The control system also comprises a communicating means for transmitting said desired movement to said desired movement to said at least two drive units to move said vehicle in accordance with the desired movement. One advantage with the control system according to the present invention is that it can move a vehicle along any predefined path, with a predefined change in rotation in accordance with a time scale. Another advantage with this control system is that it is scalable, i.e. it can move any number of vehicles simultaneously along different paths. Another advantage with this control system is that it allows vehicles to move in any direction. It makes no assumptions as to one direction being more natural than another. Yet another advantage with this control system is that it uses the same method of describing any type of movement or path.",
        "A further advantage in his context if said control system also comprises a navigation system for determining an actual position of said vehicle, which actual position is transmitted to said computing means for correcting errors between the actual position and a desired position according to said desired movement of said vehicle.",
