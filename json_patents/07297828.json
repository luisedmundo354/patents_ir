More particularly, for example, a hydrocarbon fraction that comprises at least one olefin that has 9 to 16 carbon atoms or 10 to 14 carbon atoms per molecule or, for example, a hydrocarbon fraction that comprises at least one olefin that has 14 to 20 carbon atoms, in the presence of at least one catalyst that is supported on a substrate that comprises a particular silica-alumina matrix and at least one zeolite, will be used.",
        "The phenylalkanes that are obtained according to the invention constitute compounds for the formulation, after sulfonation, of biodegradable detergents.",
        "Currently, the bases for biodegradable detergents rely extensively on linear alkylbenzenes. The production of this type of compound is growing steadily. One of the primary properties sought for these compounds, after the sulfonation stage, is, in addition to their detergent power, their biodegradability. To ensure maximum biodegradability, the alkyl group should be linear and long, and the distance between the sulfonate group and the terminal carbon of the linear chain should be as great as possible. The most advantageous agents for alkylation of benzene consist of C9-C16 linear olefins, and preferably C10-C14 linear olefins.",
        "The linear alkylbenzenes that are obtained by alkylation of aromatic compounds, preferably by alkylation of benzene by means of (a) linear olefin(s), are prepared today by two major processes. During the stage for alkylation of benzene or aromatic compounds, the first process uses hydrofluoric acid as an acid catalyst. The second uses a Friedel-Craft-type catalyst, in particular with an AlCl3 base. These two processes lead to the formation of 2-, 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-phenylalkanes. The primary drawback of these processes is linked to environmental constraints. The first process that is based on the use of hydrofluoric acid poses severe safety problems, on the one hand, and waste treatment problems, on the other hand. The second process poses the standard problem of processes that use Friedel-Craft catalysts, in this case the problem of wastes. Actually, for this type of process, it is necessary to neutralize the effluents by a basic solution at the outlet of the reactor. Added to these various drawbacks for the two processes are the difficulties that are linked to the separation of the catalyst from the products of the reaction.",
        "These various constraints explain the advantage of developing a process for alkylation of aromatic compounds by olefins, in particular the linear olefins, in the presence of a solid catalyst.",
        "The prior art notes the use of various types of catalysts such as crystallized catalysts that have geometric selectivity properties such as the zeolites (U.S. Pat. No. 4,301,317), clays, amorphous catalysts such as the silica-aluminas or the catalysts that are based on supported heteropolyanions.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 5,344,997, U.S. Pat. No. 5,245,094 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,302,732 describe the use of amorphous silica-aluminas, with or without the presence of fluorine and/or with very low sodium contents with SiO2\u2014Al2O3 compositions in the range of 1:1 to 9:1, and preferably in the range of 65:35 to 85:15 and in particular 75:25. The solids that are disclosed are therefore for the most part silicic. The selectivity of the products of the reaction is described as increasing with the silica content.",
        "We discovered that the use of catalysts that comprise a substrate that is based on at least one zeolite and that is based on a particular non-zeolitic silica-alumina matrix, by alkylation of aromatic compounds by means of olefin(s) as defined above, made it possible to obtain higher catalytic performance levels than those of the catalysts that are described in the prior art. In particular, these new catalysts are at the same time very active, very selective and very resistant to deactivation. Hereinafter, any reference to a silica- or silico- alumina is meant to define a non-zeolitic silica- or silico- alumina.",
        "The invention relates to a process for the production of at least one compound that is selected from among the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-phenylalkanes by alkylation of an aromatic compound, preferably by alkylation of benzene, by means of at least one olefin that contains at least 9 carbon atoms per molecule, in the presence of a catalyst that comprises at least one substrate that is based on at least one zeolite and that is based on a particular silica-alumina, whereby said alkylation reaction is carried out under a pressure of about 0.1 to 10 MPa, a temperature of about 30 to 400\u00b0 C., an hourly volumetric flow rate of about 0.5 to 200 h\u22121, and a molar ratio of the aromatic compound to all the olefin(s) contained in the feedstock of about 1:1 to 50:1. The invention relates most particularly to the alkylation of an aromatic compound by means of a linear olefin for the purpose of producing linear phenylalkanes.",
        "Within the framework of this invention, the hydrocarbon feedstock that is used to carry out the alkylation of the benzene core can contain, in addition to at least one olefin as defined above, one or more paraffins, one or more other aromatic compound(s), one or more polyolefinic compound(s) (for example diolefinic compound(s)), one or more mono- and/or poly-unsaturated non-linear olefin(s) and optionally hydrogen. These fractions can also contain one or more alpha-olefin(s) in a very variable amount from the trace state up to very large amounts, and even in the majority for the most part relative to said feedstock. The olefins can be linear or branched olefins. The hydrocarbon feedstock preferably comprises a majority of paraffins.",
        "The process according to this invention makes it possible to produce, preferably simultaneously, at least one compound that is selected from among the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-phenylalkanes. In the case where the feedstock comprises linear olefins, the process according to the invention makes it possible to produce linear phenylalkanes for the most part. In the case where the feedstock comprises branched olefins, the process according to the invention makes it possible to produce branched phenylalkanes for the most part.",

        "The applicant discovered in particular that, preferably and in a surprising way, the interaction between the zeolite and the silica-alumina creates an effect of synergy with respect to BET surface that makes it possible to obtain very good catalytic properties in terms of alkylation of aromatic compounds.",

The mean mercury diameter is defined as being a diameter such that all the pores of a size smaller than this diameter constitute 50% of the pore volume (VHg) in an interval encompassed between 36 \u212b and 1000 \u212b. One of the reasons for which it is preferable to use the substrate as a base to define the pore distribution resides in the fact that the contact angle of the mercury varies after impregnation of the metals based on the nature and the type of metals. The wetting angle was assumed to be equal to 140\u00b0 by following the recommendations of the work \u201cTechniques de l'ing\u00e9nieur, trait\u00e9, analyse et caract\u00e9risation [Engineering Techniques, Treatise, Analysis, and Characterization],\u201d pp. 1050-5, J.

The mean mercury diameter is also defined as being a diameter such that all the pores of a size less than this diameter constitute 50% of the total mercury pore volume.",
        "So as to better characterize the pore distribution, the following pore distribution criteria in terms of mercury are finally defined: volume V1 corresponds to the volume that is contained in the pores whose diameter is less than the mean diameter minus 30 \u212b. Volume V2 corresponds to the volume that is contained in the pores with a diameter that is greater than or equal to the mean diameter minus 30 \u212b and less than the mean diameter plus 30 \u212b. Volume V3 corresponds to the volume that is contained in the pores with a diameter that is greater than or equal to the mean diameter plus 30 \u212b. Volume V4 corresponds to the volume that is contained in the pores whose diameter is less than the mean diameter minus 15 \u212b. Volume V5 corresponds to the volume that is contained in the pores with a diameter that is greater than or equal to the mean diameter minus 15 \u212b and less than the mean diameter plus 15 \u212b. Volume V6 corresponds to the volume that is contained in the pores with a diameter that is greater than or equal to the mean diameter plus 15 \u212b.",

        "X diffraction is a technique that can be used to characterize the substrates and catalysts according to the invention. In the following specification, the analysis of x rays is carried out on powder with a Philips PW 1830 diffractometer that operates in reflection and is equipped with a rear monochromator by using CoKalpha radiation (\u03bbK\u03b11=1.7890 \u212b, \u03bbK\u03b12=1.793 \u212b, intensity ratio K\u03b11/K\u03b12=0.5). For the X diffraction diagram of the gamma-alumina, reference will be made to the ICDD data base, form 10-0425. In particular, the two most intense peaks are located at a position that corresponds to one d encompassed between 1.39 and 1.40 \u212b and one d encompassed between 1.97 \u212b to 2.00 \u212b. d is called the inter-reticular distance that is derived from the angular position by using Bragg's equation:\n\n(2d(hk1)*sin(\u03b8)=\u03b7*\u03bb).",
        "Gamma-alumina is defined in the text below, i.a., as, for example, an alumina contained in the group that consists of cubic gamma-aluminas, pseudo-cubic gamma-aluminas, tetragonal gamma-aluminas, poorly or slightly crystallized gamma-aluminas, large-surface gamma-aluminas, small-surface gamma-aluminas, gamma-aluminas that are obtained from coarse boehmite, gamma-aluminas that are obtained from crystallized boehmite, gamma-aluminas that are obtained from boehmite that is slightly or poorly crystallized, gamma-aluminas that are obtained from a mixture of crystallized boehmite and an amorphous gel, gamma-aluminas that are obtained from an amorphous gel, and gamma-aluminas evolving toward delta. For the positions of diffraction peaks of eta-, delta- and theta-aluminas, it is possible to refer to the article by B. C. Lippens and J. J. Steggerda in \u201cPhysical and Chemical Aspects of Adsorbents and Catalysts,\u201d E. G. Linsen (Ed.), Academic Press, London. 1970, pp. 171-211.",
        "For the substrates and catalysts according to the invention, the X diffraction diagram demonstrates a wide peak that is characteristic of the presence of amorphous silica. Furthermore, in the entire text that follows, the alumina compound can contain an amorphous fraction that is difficult to detect by the DRX techniques. It will therefore be understood below that the alumina compounds that are used or described in the text can contain an amorphous or poorly crystallized fraction.",
        "A method of characterization of the substrates and catalysts according to the invention that can be used is transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). For this purpose, an electronic microscope (such as Jeol 2010 or Philips Tecnai 20F, optionally with scanning) that is equipped with an energy dispersion spectrometer (EDS) for x-ray analysis (for example a Tracor or an Edax) is used. The EDS detector should make possible the detection of light elements. The combination of these two tools, TEM and EDS, makes it possible to combine the imagery and the local chemical analysis with good spatial resolution.",
        "For this type of analysis, the samples are finely ground in the dry state in a mortar; the powder is then included in the resin to produce ultrafine fractions with a thickness of about 70 nm. These fractions are collected on copper grids that are covered by an amorphous carbon film with holes used as a substrate. They are then introduced into the microscope for observation and analysis under secondary vacuum. By imagery, the sample zones are then easily distinguished from the resin zones. A certain number of analyses, 10 at a minimum, preferably between 15 and 30, are then initiated on different zones of the industrial sample. The size of the electronic beam for the analysis of the zones (approximately determining the size of the analyzed zones) is 50 nm of diameter at a maximum, preferably 20 nm, even more preferably 10, 5, 2 or 1 nm of diameter. In the scanned mode, the analyzed zone will be based on the size of the scanned zone and no longer on the size of the beam, which is generally small.",

        "The peak rate and the crystalline fraction are important parameters to consider. The peak rates and the crystalline fractions are determined by x-ray diffraction relative to a reference zeolite, by using a procedure derived from the ASTM D3906-97 method \u201cDetermination of Relative X-Ray Diffraction Intensities of Faujasite-Type-Containing Materials.\u201d It will be possible to refer to this method for the general conditions of application of the procedure, and, in particular, for the preparation of samples and references.",
        "A diffractogram consists of the characteristic lines of the crystallized fraction of the sample and of a background, created essentially by the diffusion of the amorphous or microcrystalline fraction of the sample (a weak diffusion signal is related to the equipment, air, sampling device, etc.). The peak rate of a zeolite is the ratio, in a predefined angular zone (typically 8 to 40\u00b0 2\u03b8 when copper radiation K\u03b1, 1=0.154 nm, is used), of the area of the lines of the zeolite (peaks) to the overall area of the diffractogram (peaks+background). This peaks/(peaks+background) ratio is proportional to the amount of zeolite that is crystallized in the material. To estimate the crystalline fraction of a Y zeolite sample, the peak rate of the sample will be compared to that of a reference considered to be 100% crystallized (NaY, for example). The peak rate of a completely crystallized NaY zeolite is on the order of 0.55 to 0.60.",
        "The semi-quantitative treatment of X spectra collected with the aid of the EDS spectrometer makes it possible to obtain the relative concentration of Al and Si (in % atomic) and the Si/Al ratio for each of the analyzed zones. It is then possible to calculate the Si/Alm mean and the standard deviation \u03c3 of this set of measurements. In the non-limiting examples of the following specification of the invention, the 50 nm probe is the probe that is used to characterize the substrates and catalysts according to the invention, unless otherwise indicated.",

A graduated cylinder with acceptable dimensions is filled by successive additions, and between each addition, the catalyst is packed by shaking the cylinder until a constant volume is achieved. This measurement is generally carried out on 1000 cm3 of catalyst packed into a cylinder whose height to diameter ratio is close to 5:1. This measurement can preferably be carried out on automated devices such as Autotap\u00ae that is marketed by Quantachrome.",

The amount of aluminum in the supernatant corresponds to the non-sedimented alumina compound and the dissolved aluminum and the fraction that is ultrafiltered with dissolved aluminum only. The amount of sedimented particles is derived from the theoretical concentration of aluminum in the dispersion (by considering that all of the solid that is introduced is dispersed) and amounts of boehmite actually dispersed and aluminum in solution. The alumina precursors that are used according to this invention are therefore distinguished from those that are used in the case of true co-precipitations that are entirely soluble in acid medium: cationic alumina salts, for example aluminum nitrate.

The hydrothermal treatment is perfectly defined by the conjonction of operating variables that are temperature, duration, total pressure and partial pressure of water vapor. The purpose of this treatment is to extract aluminum atoms from the silico-aluminum framework of the zeolite. The consequence of this treatment is an increase of the SiO2/Al2O3 framework molar ratio and a reduction of the parameter of the crystalline mesh.",

The crystalline parameter of this zeolite may have reduced by extraction aluminums of the structure or framework during the preparation, but the overall SiO2/Al2O3 ratio has not changed because the aluminums have not been extracted chemically. Such a globally non-dealuminified zeolite therefore has a silicon and aluminum composition that is expressed by the overall SiO2/Al2O3 ratio that is equivalent to the starting non-dealuminified Y zeolite. The values of the parameters (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio and crystalline parameter) are provided below. This globally non-dealuminified Y zeolite can be either in hydrogen form or at least partially exchanged with metallic cations, for example with the aid of alkaline-earth metal cations and/or rare earth metal cations of atomic numbers 57 to 71 inclusive.

The zeolite can be, for example, without this being limiting, in the form of powder, ground powder, suspension, or suspension that has undergone a deagglomeration treatment. Thus, for example, the zeolite can be put into a suspension that may or may not be acidified at a concentration that is adjusted to the final content of zeolite targeted in the substrate. This suspension that is commonly called a slip is then mixed with the precursors of the matrix at any stage of its synthesis as described above.",

The zeolite can be, without this being limiting, in the form of powder, ground powder, suspension or suspension that has undergone a deagglomeration treatment.",
