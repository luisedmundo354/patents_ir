        "This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 11/339,648 filed Jan. 26, 2006, which is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/JP2005/014251 filed on Jul. 28, 2005, which claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-221831 filed on Jul. 29, 2004, and No. 2005-216229 filed on Jul. 26, 2005.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an ink jet ink which has high environmental gas resistance and provides good images in which the occurrence of metallic luster, the so-called bronze phenomenon, is suppressed even when the ink is printed on a recording medium. The present invention also relates to an ink jet recording method, an ink cartridge, a recording unit, and an ink jet recording apparatus each using the ink jet ink.",
        "2. Related Background Art",
        "An ink jet recording method is a recording method of applying a small ink droplet to any one of recording media such as plain paper and glossy media to form an image, and has become rapidly widespread owing to reduction in costs and improvement in recording rate. With the rapid spread of digital cameras in addition to improvement in the quality of images recorded by the method, the method has been generally used as a method of outputting photographic images comparable to silver halide photographs.",
        "In recent years, image quality has undergone improvement more than ever owing to, for example, extreme reduction in size of an ink droplet and an improvement of the color gamut involved in the introduction of multi-color inks. Meanwhile, there have been growing demands for coloring materials and inks, and stricter properties have been required in respect of improvement of color developability and reliability concerning anti-clogging or ejection stability.",
        "As compared with the silver halide photograph, the ink jet recording method is problematic in respect of, for example, the image storage stability of the resultant recorded product. In general, the recorded product obtained by the ink jet recording method is inferior in image storage stability to that by the silver halide photograph, and involves the emergence of a problem in that a coloring material on the recorded product is apt to deteriorate to cause a change in the color tone of the image and the color fading of the image when the recorded product is exposed to light, heat, environmental gases present in the air, or the like for a long period of time. In particular, the enhancement of environmental gas resistance to the level of silver halide photographs has been of a concern from the past in the ink jet recording method. Cyan has the lowest environmental gas resistance among yellow, magenta, and cyan, which are hues used for ink jet ink. Therefore, the enhancement of the environmental gas resistance of cyan ink to the level comparable to that of yellow ink or magenta ink is of one important concern in the ink jet recording method.",
        "The basic skeletons of coloring materials for ink jet ink having a cyan hue are roughly classified into a phthalocyanine skeleton and a triphenylmethane skeleton. Representative coloring materials of the former include C.I. Direct Blue 86 and 87, and C.I. Direct Blue 199. Representative coloring materials of the latter include C.I. Acid Blue 9.",
        "In general, a phthalocyanine-based coloring material is characterized in that it is excellent in light resistance as compared with a triphenylmethane-based coloring material. Furthermore, the phthalocyanine-based coloring material has high fastness properties against humidity or heat and has good color developability, and so the coloring material has been widely used as a coloring material for ink jet ink.",
        "However, the phthalocyanine-based coloring material tends to be poor in fastness against environmental gases in the air (such as ozone, Nox, or SO2), especially an ozone gas. In particular, in a recorded product obtained by applying the coloring material on a recording medium having an ink-receiving layer containing an inorganic substance such as alumina or silica, the fastness is significantly low, hence the color fading of the recorded product is remarkable when the recorded product is left standing in a room for a long period of time. Various compounds to be added to ink have been disclosed for the purpose of improving the environmental gas resistance (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H05-171085, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H11-29729, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H10-130517, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-303009, and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-249677). However, none of those publications has achieved the compatibility between good color developability and-high environmental gas resistance for ink jet ink.",
        "The phthalocyanine-based coloring material involves another problem, that is, the occurrence of metallic luster resulting from the high aggregation properties of the coloring material, the so-called bronze phenomenon. When the bronze phenomenon occurs in a recorded product, the optical reflection properties of the recorded product change. As a result, the color developability and hue of an image remarkably change, with the result that the image quality is significantly lowered. The bronze phenomenon is considered to occur as a result of the aggregation of the coloring material on the surface of a recording medium due to, for example, the high aggregation properties of the coloring material in ink and a lowering in permeability of the-ink into the recording medium when the ink is applied to the recording medium in particular, a coloring material with an amino group introduced in its molecule for the purpose of improving environmental gas resistance, or an ink containing a coloring material having low solubility in water tends to significantly cause the bronze phenomenon.",
        "For example, it has been proposed that a specific phthalocyanine-based coloring material is used to improve the environmental gas resistance (see, for example, Japanese Patent No. 2942319). The use of the specific phthalocyanine-based coloring material provides the environmental gas resistance which is of one concern in the phthalocyanine-based coloring material. However, in the proposition, there is no reference to the bronze phenomenon, and hence, resistance to the bronze phenomenon of the coloring material is unclear. In other words, the compatibility between resistance to bronze phenomenon (bronze resistance) and environmental gas resistance has not yet been achieved.",
        "Therefore, it is indispensable to conduct research on ink jet ink using a phthalocyanine-based coloring material which is excellent in color developability, has high environmental gas resistance, and suppresses the occurrence of the bronze phenomenon.",
        "The inventors have conducted research on the compounds represented by the under-mentioned general formula (I) and salts thereof which are high in environmental gas resistance, and found that the bronze phenomenon occurs according to the rate of substituents bonded to the phthalocyanine skeleton in some cases.",
        "Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an ink jet ink with which metallic luster appearing in printing on a recording medium, i.e. the bronze phenomenon is kept from occurring and good images can be obtained.",
        "Another object of the present invention is to provide a recording method, a recording unit, an ink cartridge, and an ink jet recording apparatus each using the ink jet ink.",
        "The above objects are achieved by the present invention described below. That is, according to one aspect of the present invention, an ink jet ink comprising at least a coloring material is provided in which the coloring material is a compound represented by the following general formula (I) or a salt thereof, and in which the ink further comprises an amino compound represented by the following general formula (II):",

In particular, when the under-mentioned d75 value exceeds 7.50 nm, the bronze phenomenon conspicuously occurs in some cases. In addition, in an ink in which the compound represented by the above formula (I) or a salt thereof is contained in an amount of more than 0.5 mass % and less than 3.0 mass % based on the whole mass of the ink, when the d75 value exceeds 10.60 nm, the bronze phenomenon occurs in some cases. Upon finding such problems as mentioned above, the present inventors have come to make the present invention under the recognition that it is necessary to prevent the bronze phenomenon.",

However, in general, the substitution position isomers are not distinguished from one another, and are often regarded as the same derivative.",

        "In general, a phthalocyanine-based coloring material has higher aggregation properties than coloring materials having other structures (for example, a triphenylmethane-based, azo-based, or xanthene-based coloring material). The enhancement of the aggregation properties elevates fastness. Meanwhile, coloring materials having high aggregation properties shows high aggregation properties also in ink. Therefore, when an image is printed on a recording medium by using such coloring materials, the bronze phenomenon tends to remarkably occur to lower image quality.",
        "In contrast, when a coloring material has significantly low aggregation properties, the fastness properties (especially environmental gas resistance) of the coloring material deteriorate. Therefore, the recorded product obtained by using an ink containing such a coloring material may be unable to obtain image storage stability at the same level as yellow ink and magenta ink which are excellent in environmental gas resistance.",
        "Accordingly, when the compound represented by the general formula (I) or the salt thereof is used as a coloring material, the aggregation properties of the coloring material must be controlled in such a manner that the occurrence of the bronze phenomenon can be suppressed and desired environmental gas resistance can be obtained.",

As a result, they have found that the aggregation properties of the coloring material, the compound represented by the general formula (I) and the salt thereof, can be controlled by changing kinds of its substituents, and further color developability can be improved and the bronze phenomenon can be prevented from occurring by including the amine compound represented by the general formula (II), and arrived at the present invention.",
        "(Measurement of Aggregation Properties of Coloring Material)",
        "A small-angle X-ray scattering method is applicable to the measurement of the aggregation properties of a coloring material used in the present invention.",
        "As described in, for example, \u201cSaishin Colloid Kagaku\u201d (Latest Colloid Chemistry) (Kodansha Scientific, Fumio Kitahara and Kunio Furusawa) and \u201cHyomen Jotai and Colloid Jotai\u201d (Surface State and Colloid State) (Tokyo Kagaku Dozin, Co., Ltd., Masayuki Nakagaki), the small-angle X-ray scattering method is an approach that has been generally used for calculating a distance between colloid particles in a colloidal solution.",
        "The outline of a small-angle X-ray scattering apparatus will be described with reference to FIG. 1 showing the measurement principle of the small-angle X-ray scattering method. The focal spot size of each of X-rays generated from an X-ray source is reduced to about several millimeters during the passing of the X-rays through first to third slits, and a sample solution is irradiated with the X-rays. The X-rays with which the sample solution is irradiated are scattered by particles in the sample solution before the X-rays are detected on an imaging plate. Since the scattered X-rays interfere with each other because of an optical path difference between them, a distance d value between particles can be determined on the basis of a Bragg equation (the following expression (1)) using the resultant \u03b8 value. When particles are arranged to be equidistance, the d value determined here is considered to be a distance from the center of a particle to the center of an adjacent particle.\n\nd=\u03bb/2 sin \u03b8\u2003\u2003Eq. (1)\n\n(In the expression (1), \u03bb represents the wavelength of an X-ray, d represents the distance between particles, and \u03b8 represents a scattering angle.)",
        "In general, no peak occurs in a scattering angle profile when particles in a solution are not regularly arranged. In the case of an aqueous solution of the coloring material (phthalocyanine-based coloring material) used in the present invention, a strong peak having the maximum value in the range of 2\u03b8=0\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 is detected, and particles (molecular aggregates) formed by aggregation of phthalocyanine-based coloring material molecules are found to be arranged by a certain regulation. FIG. 2 shows the scattering angle profile in a 10-mass % aqueous solution of each of a triphenylmethane-based coloring material having a structure represented by Compound (1) below and a phthalocyanine-based coloring material having the structure represented by the general formula (I). FIG. 2 shows that phthalocyanine-based coloring materials specifically have scattering angle peaks even when they have the same cyan hue. In other words, several phthalocyanine molecules are aggregated in an aqueous solution of a phthalocyanine-based coloring material to form molecular aggregates. In addition, the distances between the molecular aggregates have such a constant distribution as represented by the scattering angle profile.",
        "",
        "FIG. 3 is a schematic view of the dispersion distance between molecular aggregates of a phthalocyanine-based coloring material. As shown in FIG. 3, the radius of a certain molecular aggregate of the phthalocyanine-based coloring material is denoted by r1 and the distance between molecular aggregates is denoted by d1. Assuming that d1 is always constant when the structure of the phthalocyanine-based coloring material remains unchanged, the d value measured by a small-angle X-ray scattering method is considered to increase from d2 to d3 as the radius of the molecular aggregate formed by the phthalocyanine-based coloring material increases from r1 to r2. Accordingly, the d value measured by the above method is considered to be an indication of the size of the molecular aggregate of the phthalocyanine-based coloring material, and the size of the molecular aggregate formed from coloring material molecules is considered to increase as the d value increases.",
        "Investigation into the relationship between the d value in ink containing a phthalocyanine-based coloring material and the bronze phenomenon has revealed that in the case of phthalocyanine-based coloring materials represented by the same structural formula, the bronze phenomenon is more likely to occur as the d value is larger. Taking into consideration the fact that the bronze phenomenon occurs owing to the aggregation of coloring material molecules on a recording medium, it has been supported that there is the correlation between the d value described above and the size of a molecular aggregate.",
        "A peak shape in a scattering angle profile indicates the distribution of the distances between molecular aggregates, that is, the distribution of the dispersion distances between the molecular aggregates. Taking into consideration the above-described fact that the dispersion distances are an indication of the sizes of molecular aggregates, such scattering angle profile is supposed to indicate the distribution of the sizes of molecular aggregates in a solution. In other words, assuming that the peak area of a scattering angle profile shows the sizes of the entire molecular aggregates in a solution, the bronze phenomenon tends to be more likely to occur as the d value is larger, that is, the frequency of large molecular aggregates is higher. Therefore, reducing the frequency of large molecular aggregates which are apt to cause the bronze phenomenon is expected to be capable of suppressing the occurrence of the bronze phenomenon. However, in the case of ink containing only significantly small molecular aggregates, the environmental gas resistance of the ink is lowered, although the bronze phenomenon is less likely to occur. Accordingly, the sizes of molecular aggregates (the absolute value of the d value) must be appropriately controlled for suppressing the occurrence of the bronze phenomenon and for obtaining environmental gas resistance.",
        "In general, when the sizes of coloring material molecules have a certain frequency distribution, the threshold value of the visual sense which is the limit of the observability of a human being is said to be 25% of the entire amount. In view of the above, the d value at the point at which large molecular aggregates causative of the bronze phenomenon comes to account for 25% or less of the entire aggregates, i.e., the point at which small molecular aggregates which hardly cause the bronze phenomenon account for 75% or more of the entire aggregates is defined as a d75 value and the d75 value is so controlled as to fall within a specific range, whereby ink which suppresses the occurrence of the bronze phenomenon and has high environmental gas resistance can be obtained.",
        "In actuality, according to investigation into the correlation between each of a dpeak value calculated from the peak of a 2\u03b8 value in a scattering angle profile and the above-described d75 value, and the occurrence level of the bronze phenomenon, it has been found that the d75 value in which a distribution factor of the sizes of the entire molecular aggregates is taken into account has a stronger correlation with the bronze phenomenon than the dpeak value. A base line for determining the 2\u03b8 value is drawn in the range of 0.5\u00b0 to 5\u00b0.",
        "The following experiment was carried out using compounds prepared by changing the number, kinds, and substitution positions of substituents in the compound represented by the general formula (I) or the salt thereof, which is a phthalocyanine-based coloring material, that is, coloring materials with the aggregation properties controlled. Inks containing the coloring materials were prepared, and the scattering angle profiles of the inks were measured to calculate the d75 values. Next, the coloring materials were evaluated for the aggregation properties on the basis of their respective d75 values. As a result, it turned out that when the d75 value was 6.70 nm or more and 10.60 nm or less and the content of the coloring material was more than 3.0 mass % based on the total mass of the ink, the bronze phenomenon occurred, and besides, that when the d75 value was more than 10.60 nm and the content of the coloring material was more than 0.5 mass %, the bronze phenomenon occurred.",
        "In each of the above case, it has been found that when the amine compound represented by the general formula (II) is included in the ink, the bronze phenomenon is prevented from occurring and high-environmental gas resistance is developed.",
        "A molecular density in a solution must be kept constant in order to measure the d value by a small-angle X-ray scattering method. Therefore, the d value is preferably measured by using ink with its coloring material concentration kept constant. In the present invention, ink was diluted with purified water so as for the coloring material content (mass %) to be 0.5 mass % with respect to the total mass of the ink, and the scattering angle profile of the diluted ink was measured. The fact that the coloring material content in the ink is 0.5 mass % can be examined on the basis of the fact that the absorbance of the ink diluted 150 times with purified water is in the range of 1.15 to 1.30. The conditions under which the absorbance is measured are as follows.",

        "The aggregation properties of the coloring material described above has a correlation also with the maximum absorption wavelength (\u03bbmax) in an absorption spectrum. Ink having higher molecular aggregation properties (a higher d75 value) tends to have smaller \u03bbmax. Therefore, a coloring material can be evaluated for its aggregation properties by means of \u03bbmax having a correlation with the d75 value. In this case, when the \u03bbmax in the ink diluted 2,000 times with pure water is 612.0 nm or less and the coloring material content exceeds 3.0 mass % based on the total mass of the ink, the bronze phenomenon may occur, and when the \u03bbmax is less than 608.0 nm and the coloring material content exceeds 0.5 mass %, the bronze phenomenon may occur. Here, the conditions for measuring the maximum absorption wavelength are the same as the aforementioned conditions for measuring the absorbance.",

        "Where the amine compound of the above general formula (II) is included in the ink, in particular, the effect of preventing the bronze phenomenon from occurring is remarkably exhibited. The reason therefor is considered to be that when a water-soluble organic solvent evaporates on a recording medium on which the ink is applied, the following phenomenon occurs. In the case where the amine compound of the general formula (II) is in existence, an unshared electron pair of a nitrogen atom in the amine compound interacts with a primary aggregate of a phthalocyanine-based coloring material. Since the amine compound existing around the aggregate causes steric hindrance, it is difficult to bring about secondary aggregation.",
        "It is considered that since a nitrogen atom having an unshared electron pair can easily approach a primary aggregate, the interaction between an amine compound and a primary aggregate most effectively occurs when using a primary amine as the amine compound, and the effectiveness is followed by a secondary amine and a tertiary amine in this order. In addition, in the case where an amine compound interacts with a primary aggregate, if the organic group of the amine compound is bulky, it is difficult for primary aggregates to approach to each other, and hence secondary aggregation is considered to be difficult to bring about. Furthermore, when the amine compound is high in boiling temperature, preferably solid at normal temperature, the organic compound easily stays close to the aggregate without evaporating on a recording medium, and it is difficult for secondary aggregation to occur.",
        "As a result of exhaustive researches conducted by the present inventors based on the above findings, it has been found that when using the compound of the general formula (I) or the salt thereof which is a phthalocyanine-based coloring material having high aggregation properties, and the amine compound of the general formula (II) in combination, the secondary aggregation of the coloring material on a recording medium can be surely prevented, and high resistance to environmental gas is developed.",
        "Particularly among the amine compounds, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane is a primary amine, has a bulky tris-hydroxymathyl group in its molecular structure, and is solid at normal temperature. Therefore, from the afore-mentioned viewpoint, the bronze phenomenon resulting from the compound of the general formula (II) or the salt thereof can be effectively prevented.",

If the amine compound content is less than 0.1 mass %, the effect of preventing the bronze phenomenon may be insufficient in some cases, and on the other hand, if the amine compound content is more than 10 mass % the ejection properties of the ink may be lowered depending on ink jet recording apparatuses. In addition, the content of the amine compound represented by the general formula (II) is preferably 5.0 mass % or more with respect to the content of the coloring material which is the compound represented by the general formula (I) or the salt thereof. The reason therefore is that if the rate of the amine compound content is less than 5.0 mass %, the effect of preventing the bronze phenomenon from occurring may not be sufficiently exhibited. Furthermore, the content of the compound represented by the general formula (II) is preferably 1,000 mass % or less with respect to the content of the coloring material which is the compound represented by the general formula (I) or the salt thereof. The reason therefore is that if the rate of the amine compound content is more than 1,000 mass %, the ejection properties of the ink may be lowered depending on ink jet recording apparatuses. When the amine compound represented by the general formula (II) is excessively included, the bronze phenomenon can be prevented from occurring, but the viscosity of the ink may come to be too high, thus affecting the ejection properties of the ink in some cases.",

If the content is smaller than the range, reliability for ejection properties, etc. may lower when the water-soluble organic solvent is used for ink jet ink, on the other hand, if the content is larger than the range, insufficient ink supply due to an increase in viscosity of ink may occur.",

In particular, 2-pyrrolidone is preferable because it is particularly effective in suppressing the occurrence of the bronze phenomenon when it is used in combination with the compound represented by the general formula (I) or the salt thereof. The content (mass %) of 2-pyrrolidone in ink is preferably 50.0% or more with respect to the coloring material content (mass %) in order to obtain the effect by incorporating 2-pyrrolidone into the ink.",

The d75 value of ink obtained by a small-angle X-ray scattering method does not,change depending on the presence or absence of those specific water-soluble organic solvents in the ink. In view of this, those specific water-soluble organic solvents do not change the aggregation properties of a coloring material in the ink, and are capable of suppressing the aggregation of molecular aggregates of the coloring material on the recording medium.

        "When the ph of ink is low, the solubility of the compound of the formula (I) in the ink is reduced and the aggregation is apt to occur. Accordingly, if the pH of ink is high, the aggregation is suppressed, and it comes to be difficult for the bronze phenomenon to occur. Therefore, the pH of ink is preferably in the range of from 6.0 to 11.0. Additionally, in order to particularly effectively suppress the bronze phenomenon, it is preferred that the pH of ink is 9.0 or more.",

The method is applicable to any one of a so-called on-demand type and a so-called continuous type. In particular, the method is effective for the on-demand type because of the following reason. At least one driving signal which corresponds to recording information and causes a sudden increase in temperature exceeding nuclear boiling is applied to electrothermal converters arranged corresponding to a sheet or liquid flow path holding a liquid (ink), thereby causing the electrothermal converter to generate thermal energy. Then, film boiling is generated on the thermal action surface of a recording head. As a result, an air bubble in the liquid (ink) can be formed so as to be in one-to-one correspondence with the driving signal. The growth and contraction of the air bubble eject the liquid (ink) through an opening for ejection, thereby forming at least one droplet. It is more preferable that the driving signal is of a pulse shape because the growth and contraction of an air bubble can be performed immediately and appropriately, and hence the liquid (ink) can be ejected with excellent responsiveness.",

        "The scattering angle profile of each of the inks 1 to 17 (each having a coloring material concentration of 0.5 mass %) was measured by means of a small-angle X-ray scattering method. In the measurement, the inks were diluted with purified water so that their coloring material concentrations were 0.5 mass % based on the total mass of the ink, and used. The scattering angle profile was measured under the following conditions.",

        "Each of the inks 1 to 17 thus prepared was mounted on an ink jet recording apparatus (trade name: Pixus 950i; manufactured by CANON Inc.) to print a 13-level gradation pattern on an ink jet glossy medium (trade name: PR101; manufactured by CANON Inc.) by changing a printing duty to 5, 12, 21, 29, 35, 43, 51, 58, 66, 74, 85, 90, and 100%. Thus, a recorded product was created.",
        "(5) Evaluation of Bronze Resistance",
        "The printing duty at which the bronze phenomenon occurred in the 13-level gradation pattern of the recorded product thus created was visually observed to define the printing duty as the printing duty at which the bronze phenomenon occurred. In general, the bronze phenomenon is apt to occur with increasing the printing duty. In other words, the bronze phenomenon is more likely to occur where the ink has a lower printing duty at which the bronze phenomenon occurs, while the bronze phenomenon is less likely to occur where the ink has a higher printing duty at which the bronze phenomenon occurs. The criteria for the bronze resistance are as follows.",
