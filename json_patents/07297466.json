        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention generally relates to lithography processes employed in semiconductor device fabrication and, more particularly, the present invention relates to the formation of a patterned photoresist, and to a method of a patterning a surface layer of a semiconductor substrate using a patterned photoresist.",
        "A claim of priority is made to Korean Patent Application No. 2002-0048129, filed Aug. 14, 2002, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "As the integration density of semiconductor devices continues to increase and as chip sizes continue to decrease, there is an increasing need to form patterns with finer and finer dimensions. However, as the patterned dimensions in lateral directions are reduced as necessary to form fine patterns, it is also necessary to reduce the thickness of the photoresist layer in order to avoid the collapse of the resist pattern during a wet development process of lithography. This reduction in thickness of the resist layer undesirably deteriorates resistance to dry etching, and serious line edge roughness (LER) is often observed.",
        "In an effort to overcome the poor resistance to dry etching, a method has been proposed for reducing the overall thickness of a silicon-containing resist layer using a bi-layer resist (BLR) structure. However, according to the BLR technique, adhesion to underlying layer materials is weak and solubility to a developer solution is relatively poor, making it difficult to achieve a high resolution.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 5,234,793 discloses a BLR technique which includes coating a liquid, silicon-containing compound on a resist pattern subjected to exposure and development. As a result, the dry etching resistance of the resist pattern is improved, and a pattern size can be reduced in the case of forming a hole pattern, e.g., trench or contact hole. However, this technique still has several limitations. That is, it is quite difficult to adjust a CD bias due to a difference in the amount of silicon-containing compound coated according to various pattern sizes and shapes. Also, this technique can only be applied when using a resist material which includes an anhydride group, but is not suitably used with KrF or ArF resist materials, which are commercially available at present. Further, coating a liquid compound on a resist pattern is disadvantageous in that it increases costs and extends production times.",
        "The present invention provides a method for forming a resist, and a method of patterning a layer using the resist pattern. The resist exhibits an improved line edge roughness and good resistance to dry etching even when reduced in thickness, and the methods can be adopted for various kinds of resist materials.",
        "According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for patterning a layer of a semiconductor device. An organic anti-reflective coating is formed over a surface of a semiconductor substrate, and then a resist layer is formed over the anti-reflective coating. The resist layer includes a photosensitive polymer containing a hydroxy group. The resist layer is then subjected to selective exposure and development to form a resist pattern. The resist pattern is silylated to a given depth by exposing a surface of the resist pattern to a vapor phase organic silane mixture of a first organic silane compound having a functional group capable of reacting with the hydroxy group of the photoresistive polymer, and a second organic silane compound having two functional groups capable of reacting with the hydroxy group of the photoresistive polymer. The silylated resist pattern then thermally treated, and the organic anti-reflective coating is anisotropically etched using the thermally treated resist pattern as an etching mask.",

        "The photosensitive polymer may include a p-hydroxystyrene, fluorinated alkyl alcohol or aromatic alcohol group.",

        "According to the present invention, even if it is necessary to reduce resist thickness in a lithography process, the silylated resist pattern of the present invention exhibits good resistance to dry etching.

Also, the second organic silane compound may be contained in the organic silane mixture in an amount of approximately 10 to 80 wt %, more preferably 10 to 30 wt %, based on the total weight of the organic silane mixture.",
        "If only the first organic silane compound is reacted with the hydroxy group of the photosensitive polymer, a sharp decrease in glass transition temperature (Tg) may occur in the resist pattern 30b, which can cause swelling and flow of the resist pattern 30b, resulting in severe pattern deformation. If only the second organic silane compound is reacted with the hydroxy group of the photosensitive polymer, flow of the resist pattern 30b is suppressed, so that LER occurring at edges of the resist pattern 30b cannot be entirely avoided. Therefore, in order to ensure a sufficient LER improvement by flowability of the resist pattern 30b and a pattern deformation prevention by hardening by crosslinkage, it is necessary to use a mixed organic silane compound obtained by mixing the first and second organic silane compounds in an appropriate mixing ratio.",

Therefore, as shown in FIG. 1D, a silylated resist pattern 30d is formed having a silylation region 30c extending to a given depth from the exposed surfaces.",
        "The thickness of the silylation region 30c of the silylated resist pattern 30d may vary according to the shape and size of a pattern to be formed, and is generally approximately 100 to 500 \u212b, preferably approximately 100 to 200 \u212b.",
        "When the organic silane mixture is supplied to the resist pattern 30b, the reaction temperature, the time for a reaction between the organic silane mixture and the resist pattern 30b, and/or the concentration of the organic silane mixture, can be adjusted to control the depth of the silylation region 30c.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1E, the silylated resist pattern 30d is thermally treated. The thermal treatment may be performed at a temperature of approximately 100 to 250\u00b0 C., preferably approximately 150 to 200\u00b0 C., for the purpose of densifying the silylated resist pattern 30d and stabilizing the bonding state between the resist composition and the organic silane compound.",
        "The silylated resist pattern 30d may swell a little bit horizontally and vertically during the silylation process shown in FIG. 1D. However, since such a change in pattern size is very small, that is, approximately 10 nm or less, it is not necessary to separately adjust a bias. Thus, the thermal treatment advantageously reduces the increased volume of the silylated resist pattern 30d without a separate bias adjustment.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1F, the organic ARC 20 is anisotropically etched with O2 plasma using the silylated resist pattern 30d as an etching mask, thereby forming an ARC pattern 20a. The silylated resist pattern 30d has high resistance to anisotropic etching using O2 plasma.",
        "As described above, swelling of the resist pattern occurring during the silylation process shown in FIG. 1D, is due to infiltration of the silicon compound contained in the organic silane mixture into the resist pattern to then be bonded with the polymer through a reaction between the silicon compound and hydroxy groups in the polymer contained in the resist pattern.",
        "FIG. 2 is a graphical representation illustrating evaluation results of a resist pattern thickness increase relative to a silylation time of the resist pattern according to the present invention;",
        "For the evaluation shown in FIG. 2, the resist pattern made of polyvinylphenol (PVP) based resist is subjected to silylation using an organic silane mixture. Here, dimethylsilyldimethylamine (DMSDMA) is used as a first organic silane compound and bis(dimethylamino)methylsilane (Bi(DMA)MS) was used as a second organic silane compound. The evaluation results shown in FIG. 2 are obtained when mixing DMSDMA and Bi(DMA)MS in a weight ratio of 65:35 and silylating a resist pattern having a line width of 200 nm.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2, the increase in amount of thickness of a resist pattern linearly increases over silylation time, confirming that the content of Si contained in the resist pattern can be easily controlled by silylation time.",
        "Also, a volumetric increase due to silylation of a resist pattern causes a change in critical dimension (CD).",
        "FIG. 3 shows a change in CD of a resist pattern as a function of the silylation time.",
        "For the evaluation shown in FIG. 3, resist patterns and an organic silane mixture made of the same materials as those of samples used for evaluation shown in FIG. 2 were used. The respective resist patterns were formed as line and space (L/S) patterns having various line widths of 140 nm, 160 nm, 200 nm, 240 nm and 360 nm.",
        "Referring to FIG. 3, the CD of each resist pattern linearly increases with silylation time, and increases as the size of each resist pattern increases.",
        "Some of the organic silane compounds, in particular, DMSDMA, are very effective silylating agents, but are very unstable, so that desilylation occurs over time, resulting in a reduction of the thickness of the resist pattern.",
        "FIG. 4 is graphical representation illustrating evaluation results of a resist pattern thickness decrease and CD decrease relative to a holding time of a resist pattern silylated using an organic silane mixture of DMSDMA and Bi(DMA)MS according to the present invention.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4, the resist pattern thickness decrease is very large at an initial period of holding time, and gradually becomes saturated over time. The desilylation deteriorates resistance of the resist pattern to dry etching and reduces CD.",
        "In the method for forming fine patterns of a semiconductor device according to the present invention, the silylation of the resist pattern is followed by thermal treatment for the purpose of solving the problem of a CD decrease resulting from desilyation. Here, in order to control contamination due to amine contained in a chemically amplified resist, the temperature for thermal treatment is preferably greater than a glass transition temperature (Tg) of a resist material of the resist pattern. Thermal treatment at a temperature greater than Tg densifies the resist pattern and thus prevents amine contaminants from infiltrating into the resist pattern.",
        "Also, thermal treatment performed after the silylation can prevent a silicon compound from being released from the resist pattern.",
        "FIG. 5 is graphical representation illustrating evaluation results of a resist pattern thickness decrease and CD decrease relative to a delay time of a resist pattern when the silylated resist pattern is thermally treated at various temperatures for 90 seconds according to the present invention. For comparison, evaluation results of a silylated resist pattern which is not thermally treated, are also shown in FIG. 5.",
        "Referring to FIG. 5, a thickness decrease in the silylated resist pattern which is thermally treated at a temperature of 120 C or higher, is smaller than that in the silylated resist pattern which is not thermally treated. For example, when the resist pattern is thermally treated at 160\u00b0 C., a thickness decrease of only approximately 2 nm was observed after a week of delay time. This suggests that instability of a silylating agent can be overcome by thermally treating the silylated resist pattern.",
        "Thermal treatment performed after the silylation has another advantage in that the resist film shrinks very rapidly during thermal treatment to then be densified. Shrinkage of the resist pattern due to thermal treatment can be confirmed through observation of a change in CD.",
        "FIG. 6 is graphical representation illustrating evaluation results of a CD change of a resist pattern relative to baking temperature when the resist pattern silyated with an organic silane mixture of DMSDMA and Bi(DMA)MS is thermally treated by baking at various temperatures according to the present invention. For the evaluation shown in FIG. 6, the resist patterns were formed as line and space (L/S) patterns having various line widths of 140 nm, 160 nm, 200 nm, 240 nm and 360 nm, respectively.",
        "Referring to FIG. 6, the CD of a resist pattern having increased by silylation decreases as the baking temperatures increase. Also, a CD decrease is kept constant irrespective of resist pattern size. This suggests that a CD bias due to a volumetric increase after the resist pattern is silylated can be easily controlled by subsequent thermal treatment.",
        "While this invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims."
