        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a radiation curable composition, a storing method thereof, a forming method of a cured film, a patterning method, an use of a pattern, electronic components and an optical waveguide.",
        "2. Related Background of the Invention",
        "As insulating films for use in LSIs and PDPs there have conventionally been used SiO2 films formed by CVD methods, and organic SOG (Spin On Glass) or inorganic SOG films formed by coating methods, because of their excellent heat resistance and electrical reliability. With insulating films of the prior art, however, it is impossible to directly form wiring grooves or contact holes, and usually a photoresist is patterned on the insulating film, followed by either dry etching with plasma or wet etching with a chemical solution, after which the film is subjected to a resist removal step or washing step to form a pattern. On the other hand, imparting photosensitive properties to an insulating film material with excellent heat resistance, electrical reliability and transparency eliminates the need for the resist material required in the steps mentioned above, thereby allowing the plasma dry etching, chemical solution wet etching, resist removal and washing steps to be omitted.",
        "In recent years there have been proposed radiation curing polysiloxane materials with excellent heat resistance, electrical reliability and transparency. For example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 6-148895 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 10-24696 there are disclosed photosensitive resin compositions comprising an alkali-soluble siloxane polymer, a photoacid generator and a solvent, from which the water and catalyst have been removed. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-181069 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-72502 disclose photosensitive polysilazane compositions comprising polysilazane and a photoacid generator. Also, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-288364 discloses a radiation curable composition comprising a hydrolyzable silane compound, a photoacid generator and an acid diffusion controller.",
        "However, when the present inventors conducted a detailed investigation of patterning using such conventional insulating film materials imparted with photosensitive properties, it was found that when employing the photosensitive resin compositions comprising an alkali-soluble siloxane polymer, a photoacid generator and a solvent, from which the water and catalyst have been removed as disclosed in Patent documents 1 and 2, for example, a large light exposure dose is required in both cases, and therefore mass production cannot be advantageously accomplished. In addition, when using the photosensitive polysilazane compositions comprising polysilazane and a photoacid generator, as disclosed in Patent documents 3 and 4, the light exposure dose is low but the steps of dipping in purified water after exposure or steps requiring humidification treatment are obviously complicated, making it difficult to obtain high pattern precision. On the other hand, when using a radiation curable composition comprising a hydrolyzable silane compound, a photoacid generator and an acid diffusion controller, as disclosed in Patent document 5, the acid diffusion controller controls diffusion of the acid generated by the radiation, thereby allowing the pattern precision of the silane compound to be increased. Nevertheless, since the acid diffusion controller inactivates (neutralizes) the acid, the curing property is impaired in cases with a low amount of photoacid generator or a low exposure dose, thereby often leading to lower pattern precision. Conversely, increasing the exposure dose in an attempt to improve the patterning precision is clearly an unsuitable strategy for mass production.",
        "The present invention was accomplished in light of the circumstances described above, and it provides a radiation curable composition which yields a cured product with excellent pattern precision even with a relatively low light exposure dose, a method for its storage, a forming method of a cured film and a patterning method, as well as an use of a pattern, electronic components and an optical waveguide which employ the above.",
        "When forming patterns by generation of acid with radiation according to the prior art, the generated acid is inactivated with an acid diffusion controller to improve the pattern precision. This requires an increased exposure dose for generation of extra acid to compensate for the inactivation, and therefore it has been difficult to achieve both improvement in pattern precision and reduction in exposure dose.",
        "Different strategies that have been considered for controlling diffusion of acid, other than by inactivation of the acid with an acid diffusion controller, include the strategy of reducing the exposure dose to reduce the amount of acid generated, lowering the temperature of the post-exposure baking (PEB) step after exposure, or eliminating the PEB step. However, the basic concepts of such strategies have not been elucidated, nor have radiation curable compositions suited for such strategies existed. A radiation curable composition suited for such strategies would allow formation of highly precise patterns without using an acid diffusion controller. Nevertheless, when patterning is carried out using conventional radiation curable compositions, reducing the amount of acid generated prevents curing from proceeding to an adequate degree. In addition, curing of the exposed sections also fails to adequately proceed when the temperature of the post-exposure baking (PEB) step after exposure is lowered or PEB is not carried out. As a result, it has been difficult to form highly precise patterns.",
        "As a result of much diligent research, the present inventors have completed the present invention after finding that the various problems of the prior art can be overcome by a radiation curable composition comprising specific components, a forming method of a cured film and a patterning method.",
        "The present invention provides a radiation curable composition comprising (a): a siloxane resin, (b): a photoacid generator or photobase generator, (c): a solvent capable of dissolving component (a), and (d): a curing acceleration catalyst.",
        "The invention further provides the aforementioned radiation curable composition wherein the siloxane resin includes a resin obtainable by hydrolytic condensation of a compound represented by the following general formula (1):\n\nR1nSiX4-n\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwherein R1 represents an H or F atom, a group containing a B, N, Al, P, Si, Ge or Ti atom, or a C1-20 organic group, X represents a hydrolyzable group and n represents an integer of 0-2, with the proviso that when n is 2, each R1 may be the same or different, and when n is 0-2, each X may be the same or different.",
        "The invention still further provides the aforementioned radiation curable composition wherein the curing acceleration catalyst is an onium salt. An onium salt is preferred because it can improve the electrical properties and mechanical strength of the obtained cured film, while also increasing the stability of the composition.",
        "The invention still further provides the aforementioned radiation curable composition wherein the curing acceleration catalyst is a quaternary ammonium salt. Using a quaternary ammonium salt as the curing acceleration catalyst will more notably produce the aforementioned effects of improving the electrical properties and mechanical strength while increasing the stability of the composition.",
        "The invention still further provides a forming method of a cured film comprising steps of applying the aforementioned radiation curable composition onto a substrate and drying it to obtain a coating, and exposing the coating, without heating of the coating after the exposure step. According to this method, diffusion of the acid by heat and increased production costs are adequately minimized, while the pattern precision of the cured film is sufficiently high.",

        "The invention still further provides the aforementioned forming method of a cured film wherein in the heating step, the coating is heated to 70-110\u00b0 C. This can further inhibit diffusion of the acid during heating.",
        "The invention still further provides the aforementioned forming method of a cured film wherein in the exposure step, the coating is exposed by irradiation of light at a dose of 5-100 mJ/cm2. A light dose within this range will tend to facilitate control of exposure and improve the productivity.",

According to this method, diffusion of the acid by heat and increased production costs are adequately minimized, while the pattern precision of the cured film is sufficiently high. The \u201cheat\u201d referred to here means heat at a stage prior to the removal step, and heating may also be carried out after the removal step.",
        "The invention still further provides a patterning method comprising steps of applying the aforementioned radiation curable composition onto a substrate and drying it to obtain a coating, exposing the coating via a mask, heating the coating after the exposure step and removing the unexposed sections of the coating by development after the heating step.",
        "The invention still further provides the aforementioned patterning method wherein in the heating step, the coating is heated to 70-110\u00b0 C. This can further inhibit diffusion of the acid during heating.",
        "The invention still further provides the aforementioned patterning method wherein in the exposure step, the coating is exposed by irradiation of light at a dose of 5-100 mJ/cm2. A light dose within this range will tend to facilitate control of exposure and improve the productivity.",
        "The invention still further provides the aforementioned patterning method wherein a tetramethylammonium hydroxide solution is used as the developing solution in the removal step. This method can adequately inhibit contamination of electronic components by alkali metals during development.",
        "The invention still further provides an use of a pattern wherein a pattern formed by the aforementioned patterning method is used as a resist mask.",
        "The invention still further provides an electronic component possessing a pattern formed by the aforementioned patterning method.",
        "The invention still further provides an optical waveguide possessing a pattern formed by the aforementioned patterning method.",
        "The invention still further provides a storage method for the aforementioned radiation curable composition wherein the radiation curable composition is stored at a temperature of 0\u00b0 C. or below. Storing the composition at a temperature of 0\u00b0 C. or below will result in greater the storage stability than by storage at a temperature of above 0\u00b0 C.",
        "The radiation curable composition having this construction, the forming method of a cured film and patterning method using the radiation curable composition, and the storage method for the radiation curable composition allow formation of cured films with excellent pattern precision even using a relatively low exposure dose, thus overcoming the problem of the prior art whereby it has been impossible to achieve both low exposure dose and high pattern precision.",
        "The mechanism responsible for the exhibited effect of the invention, which has not been achieved in the prior art, is not yet fully understood. However, the present inventors conjecture that the reduced exposure dose required for ensuring adequately excellent pattern precision is realized because, for example, there is no need to use an acid diffusion controller to inhibit diffusion of generated acid, and a curing acceleration catalyst is further included as an additive.",
        "The improvement in pattern precision is assumed to result because curing of the radiation curable composition occurs before diffusion of the acid or base when a curing acceleration catalyst is used as an additive. This mechanism differs from the mechanism of the prior art, whereby the acid diffusion controller inactivates (neutralizes) the generated acid to improve the pattern precision. According to the invention, it is conjectured that both pattern precision improvement and exposure dose reduction is achieved based on the aforementioned mechanism which is different from that of the prior art.",
        "The radiation curable composition, method for its storage, forming method of a cured film and patterning method of the invention can produce cured films with excellent pattern precision at relatively low exposure doses. The present invention is therefore useful for uses of a pattern, electronic components and optical waveguides.",

Consequently, the protic solvent molecules solvate by forming hydrogen bonds with nucleophilic reagents and the like.

        "Aprotic solvents, on the other hand, are solvents without hydrogen atoms on highly electronegative elements, and are therefore less a cause of reaction inhibition than are protic solvents. Consequently, curing reaction proceeds with generation of acidic active substances and basic active substances at the exposed sections, thereby minimizing any reduction in pattern precision due to diffusion of the acid or base, so that the pattern precision is improved. This is a different mechanism from that of the prior art whereby the acid diffusion controller inactivates (neutralizes) the generated acid to improve the pattern precision. It is believed that this mechanism is responsible for the greater effects of improved pattern precision and reduced exposure dose exhibited when an aprotic solvent is added to component (c).",

From the standpoint of sensitivity and pattern precision during pattern formation and mechanical strength of the cured film, ether-based solvents, ester-based solvents, ether acetate-based solvents and ketone-based solvents are preferred. Solvents containing no nitrogen are also preferred.

They may be used alone or in combinations of two or more.",
        "When the stability of the radiation curable composition is considered, component (c) is preferably soluble in water or has the solubility of water, and more preferably it is soluble in water and has the solubility of water. Thus, a protic solvent is preferably added when the aprotic solvent is not soluble in water or does not have the solubility of water. When the aprotic solvent is not soluble in water or does not have the solubility of water, and contains no protic solvent, the compatibility with the solvent of component (a) will be reduced, tending to lower the stability. However, if sensitivity is desired even at the expense of some degree of stability, a smaller amount of protic solvent is preferred.",

The amount of water used is preferably no greater than 10 wt %, more preferably no greater than 5 wt % and even more preferably no greater than 2 wt % with respect to the total amount of the radiation curable composition. If the amount of water used exceeds 10 wt %, the coatability and coating solution stability will tend to be inferior. Although the exact reason is unknown, addition of a small amount of water can sometimes permit reduction of the exposure dose.",

The curing acceleration catalyst differs from an ordinary photoacid generator or photobase generator for component (b) which generates an active substance by light. It will therefore usually be distinguished from an onium salt used as the photoacid generator or photobase generator. Nevertheless, a material which comprises both the photoacid generator or photobase generator and the curing acceleration catalyst may be used.",
        "The catalyst may be a specific one which does not exhibit a catalytic effect in solution but exhibits its activity in the coating after application. Presumably, since the curing reaction accelerated by the curing acceleration catalyst proceeds simultaneously with generation of an acidic active substance or basic active substance at the exposed sections, the reduction in the pattern precision due to diffusion of the acid or base is further inhibited, or in other words, the pattern precision is further improved.",

The insolubility temperature is defined as the minimum temperature during baking at which the change in the coating film thickness before and after immersion in the TMAH aqueous solution is less than 20%.",
        "4. The compound whose curing acceleration catalyst power is to be confirmed is added to the composition prepared in 1. above at 0.01 wt % to obtain a composition, and the insolubility temperature is determined in the same manner as 2. and 3. above.

If the concentration of these metal ions is greater than 1000 ppm, the metal ions will more readily enter into the electronic component, e.g. semiconductor element comprising the cured film obtained from the composition, potentially having an adverse effect on the device performance. Thus, if necessary, it may be effective to remove the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals from the composition using an ion-exchange filter, for example. However, no such restriction exists for use as an optical waveguide or for other uses, so long as the intended purpose is not impeded.",
        "A method of forming a patterned cured film on a substrate using a radiation curable composition of the invention will now be explained through an example of a spin coating method, which generally has excellent film formability and film uniformity. However, the forming method of a cured film is not limited to a spin coating method. Also, the substrate may have a flat surface or it may be irregular, with electrodes or the like formed therein.",
        "First, the radiation curable composition is coated onto a substrate such as a silicon wafer or glass substrate at preferably 500-5000 rpm and more preferably 500-3000 rpm to form a coating. If the rotation rate is less than 500 rpm, the film uniformity will tend to be poor, and if the rotation rate is greater than 5000 rpm, the film-forming property may be impaired.",

The film thickness for liquid crystal uses is preferably 0.1-20 \u03bcm, the film thickness for photoresist uses is preferably 0.1-2 \u03bcm, and the film thickness for optical waveguide uses is preferably 1-50 \u03bcm.

The concentration of component (a) in the composition may be adjusted to control the film thickness of the cured film. When a spin coating method is used, the film thickness may be controlled by adjusting the rotation rate and number of applications. When the film thickness is controlled by adjusting the concentration of component (a), the concentration of component (a) may be increased for a greater film thickness or the concentration of component (a) may be decreased for a smaller film thickness. When the film thickness is controlled using a spin coating method, the rotation rate may be decreased or the number of applications increased for a greater film thickness, or alternatively the rotation rate may be increased or the number applications decreased for a smaller film thickness.",
        "The solvent in the coating is then dried with a hot plate at preferably 50-200\u00b0 C. and more preferably 70-150\u00b0 C., and the drying temperature must be adjusted so that the coating will dissolve under the conditions used for subsequent development. If the drying temperature is below 50\u00b0 C., drying of the solvent will tend to be inadequate, and if it is above 200\u00b0 C., the film may not dissolve during development and a pattern may not be formed.",

If the exposure dose is less than 5 mJ/cm2 it may be difficult to achieve control depending on the light source, and if it is greater than 5000 mJ/cm2 the exposure time will be longer, tending to lower productivity. The exposure dose for an ordinary siloxane-based radiation curable composition of the prior art is about 500-5000 mJ/cm2.",
        "The radiation employed may be visible light, ultraviolet light, infrared light, X-rays, \u03b1-rays, \u03b2-rays, \u03b3-rays or the like, although ultraviolet rays are particularly preferred.

Next, 0.080 g of a photoacid generator (PAI-101, product of Midori Kagaku) was added to 20.0 g of the radiation curable composition polysiloxane solution to prepare a radiation curable composition. The amount of component (a) used was 20 wt % with respect to the total radiation curable composition, the amount of component (b) used was 0.4 wt % with respect to the total radiation curable composition, and the amount of component (d) used was 0.1 wt % with respect to the total radiation curable composition.",
        "A 2 mL portion of the radiation curable composition was added dropwise onto the center of a 6-inch silicon wafer and subjected to spin coating (30 seconds of rotation at 700 rpm) to form a coating on the wafer, and this was dried for 30 seconds on a 100\u00b0 C. hot plate. Next, the dried coating was exposed to ultraviolet rays at 75 mJ/cm2 using an exposing apparatus (FPA-3000 iW, Canon) through a negative mask bearing a line pattern with a minimum line width of 2 \u03bcm. The wafer carrying the exposed coating was heated on a 100\u00b0 C. hot plate for 30 seconds and then allowed to cool naturally until the wafer reached room temperature, after which the wafer was immersed for 30 seconds in a developing solution comprising a 2.38 wt % tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) aqueous solution, for paddle development using a coater/developer (Mark 7, product of Tokyo Electron) to dissolve the unexposed sections. The wafer was then washed and spin dried. A furnace body was used for heating of the spin dried wafer at 350\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes in a nitrogen atmosphere, to obtain a radiation cured film on the wafer. Upon observing the pattern shape of the radiation cured film from the top using an optical microscope and observing the cross--sectional shape using a SEM, it was found that the lines had been precisely formed, with a pattern precision of 2 \u03bcm.

        "When the radiation curable composition obtained in Example 2 was stored for 30 days in an atmosphere at \u221220\u00b0 C., the storage stability was superior compared to storage of the same radiation curable composition for 30 days in an atmosphere at ordinary temperature. The radiation curable composition stored in an atmosphere at \u221220\u00b0 C. was successfully patterned even after storage for 30 days, but the radiation curable composition stored for 30 days in an atmosphere at ordinary temperature could not be patterned even after 7 days. This is attributed to progressive condensation of the siloxane resin, with concomitant production of water, in the radiation curable composition stored for 7 days in an atmosphere at ordinary temperature.",
        "According to the radiation curable composition, method for its storage, forming method of a cured film and patterning method of the invention, it is possible to obtain cured films with excellent pattern precision even with a relatively low exposure dose. The invention is therefore useful for uses of a pattern, electronic components and optical waveguides."
