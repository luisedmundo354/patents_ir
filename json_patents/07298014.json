        "The present invention generally relates to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), and more specifically, to packaging techniques for reducing acoustic and/or vibration induced error in such MEMS systems.",
        "Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) are used in a wide variety of applications including inertial and guidance, optical, medical, as well as many other applications. In some of these applications, such as aeronautical, guidance, surface vehicle, marine, and down hole drilling applications, the MEMS devices can be subject to relatively harsh environments that may include substantial noise and/or vibration. In some cases, this noise and/or vibration can cause an error in the output of some MEMS devices, which is often referred to as a rectification error (RE). In some cases, the rectification error can reduce the sensitivity and/or accuracy of the MEMS device and/or system.",

In an illustrative embodiment, a visco-elastic polymer is provided around at least part of a MEMs device or system, wherein the visco-elastic polymer converts at least some of the acoustic and/or vibration energy into heat, thereby reducing the effects of the external acoustic and/or vibration energy on the MEMS device and/or system.",

The visco-elastic polymer may be provided outside of the enclosure, inside the enclosure, directly on the MEMS device, or at any other place that may help reduce the effects of the external acoustic and/or vibration energy on the MEMS device. In some cases, the device package itself or parts thereof may be made from a visco-elastic polymer, or may include one or more layers or portions that are made from a visco-elastic polymer, if desired.",

        "FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an illustrative MEMS IMU device 25 with a visco-elastic polymer layer 30. While a MEMS IMU 25 is shown in FIG. 1, it is contemplated that the visco-elastic polymer layer 30 may be used in conjunction with any suitable device or system, and especially, with any suitable device or system that is susceptible to a rectification error (RE) caused by external noise and/or vibration. In the illustrative embodiment of FIG. 1, the visco-elastic polymer 30 is situated around at least part of the MEMS IMU 25, and in some cases, completely around the MEMS IMU device 25.",
        "The visco-elastic polymer 30 is a sound and vibration absorbing material. As external acoustic or vibration energy engages the visco-elastic polymer layer 30, the polymer 30 converts at least some of the energy into heat. Thus, any remaining acoustic and/or vibration energy that passes to the MEMS IMU device 25 is reduced, which in turn, may reduce the rectification error produced by the MEMS IMU device 25. Preferably, the visco-elastic polymer 30 has high adhesion characteristics such that it adheres well to the MEMS IMU 25. One illustrative visco-elastic polymer is SR-500, SR-600 or SR-1000, available from Current, Inc. of East Haven, Conn., under the trademark Silent Running.",
        "FIG. 2 is a schematic cross-sectional side view of the visco-elastic polymer layer 30 situated around enclosure 20 of the MEMS IMU device 25 of FIG. 1. A MEMS device (e.g. die) is generally shown at 10, and is depicted here is a MEMS gyroscope die. However, it should be recognized that the device 10 may be any type of device, as desired. In the illustrative embodiment, the MEMS device 10 is enclosed within enclosure 20. The enclosure 20 may include a chassis or other packaging material used to package the MEMS device 10. In the illustrative embodiment, the visco-elastic polymer layer 30 is applied around the entire enclosure 20. However, this is not required in all embodiments. For example, the visco-elastic polymer layer 30 may be applied around only a portion of the enclosure 20.",
        "Alternatively, or in addition, a visco-elastic polymer layer 30a may be situated along at least part of the inside of the enclosure 20. Also, and in some cases, the enclosure 20 itself or parts thereof may be made from a visco-elastic polymer, or may include one or more layers or portions that are made from a visco-elastic polymer, if desired.",
        "In some cases, two or more coats of the visco-elastic polymer 30 may be applied. In one illustrative embodiment, the thickness 32 of the coats of visco-elastic polymer 30 may be 0.02 mils wet/coat. However, the number of coats and the thickness 32 of the coats may be tailored to the application at hand. Because many visco-elastic polymers are relatively light weight, the overall weight of certain devices and/or systems may be decreased relative to similar devices and/or systems that use other methods of shielding the MEMS device 10 from external noise and/or vibration.",
        "FIG. 3 is a schematic cross-sectional side view of a visco-elastic polymer 30 layer situated around a MEMS multi-chip packaging (MCP) 40. The MCP 40 is depicted as a triple-stacked device 42 with wire bonds 40. However, it is contemplated that the MCP 40 may be any type of multi-chip package including a multi-chip package that has two or more die that lie generally along a common plane. The illustrative MCP 40 includes multiple MEMS devices (e.g. die) within a common enclosure 46. As can be seen, and in the illustrative embodiment, the enclosure 46 is surrounded by a visco-elastic polymer layer 30. As noted above, the visco-elastic polymer 30 may be used to help absorb external acoustical and/or vibration energy before the energy reaches the MEMS devices 42.",

The illustrative LCC package 50 provides an enclosure 54 for a MEMS device 52. A visco-elastic polymer layer 30 is shown situated around the enclosure 54 to help absorb the external acoustic and/or vibration energy, and in some cases, help reduce the rectification error of the MEMS device 52. In some cases, the device package itself or parts thereof may be made from a visco-elastic polymer, or may include one or more layers or portions that are made from a visco-elastic polymer, if desired.",

In this illustrative embodiment, the visco-elastic polymer 30 is located within the enclosure 62. The visco-elastic polymer 30 may surrounds at least part of the MEMS device 60, inside the enclosure 62, to help mitigate the effect of external noise and/or vibration energy. In some cases, another visco-elastic polymer layer (not shown) may be situated around the outside of enclosure 62, if desired.",
        "FIG. 6 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a MEMS device 64 secured to a substrate 70. The substrate 70 may be a printed circuit board or any other suitable substrate. In some cases, the MEMS device 64 is in a package, and the package is secured to the substrate 70. In other embodiments, however, the MEMS device 64 may be directly secured to the substrate 70. As shown in FIG. 6, a visco-elastic polymer 30 is provided over at least part of the MEMS device 64, and in the illustrative embodiment, is dropped on as a blob over the MEMS device 64. As described above, the visco-elastic polymer 30 may help absorb external acoustic and/or vibration energy, and in some cases, may help reduce a rectification error of the MEMS device 64.",
        "FIG. 7 is a flow diagram of an illustrative method of applying a visco-elastic polymer 30 layer to a MEMS device or system. The method is entered at step 80. At step 82, and in the illustrative method, a MEMS device is provided that can produce a rectification error caused by external noise and/or vibration. At step 84, a visco-elastic polymer layer is applied around at least part of the MEMS device. It is contemplated that the visco-elastic polymer 30 may be applied by spraying, brushing, dipping, blobbing or by any other suitable method or technique, as desired. At step 86, the visco-elastic polymer layer is allowed to dry. In some cases, drying can take between 24 and 48 hours, but this time may vary depending on the conditions (room temperature, humidity, layer thickness, etc.) as well as the particular visco-elastic polymer used and the method of application. Once sufficiently dry, and at step 88, it is determined if the desired number of coats of visco-elastic polymer have been applied. If so, control is passed to step 90, and the method is exited. If not, control is passed back to step 84, wherein another layer is applied. It is contemplated that the thickness, type of visco-elastic polymer, method of application, and other parameters may be the same or different for each of the applied layers.",
