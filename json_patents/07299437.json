When the path set is a multi-cycle path, it is added to a timing exception path list that is output by an output unit.",

        "This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-337832, filed on Nov. 22, 2004, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "1) Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a technology for timing analysis of a digital circuit, and more particularly to a technology for detecting a timing exception path.",
        "2) Description of the Related Art",
        "Timing analysis is an essential process in manufacturing a digital circuit for ensuring a proper operation of the digital circuit. In the timing analysis, a delay is estimated from a design of the digital circuit, and it is determined whether the delay is within a range that allows the digital circuit to operate normally. For the timing analysis, not only a netlist of the digital circuit to be designed, but also timing restriction information is necessary. The timing restriction information includes specifications for a clock, a mode, delay restriction, and a timing exception path, such as a multi-cycle path and a false path.",
        "The netlist can be created, to some extent, automatically with a computer aided design system (CAD) tools such as logical synthesis tools and layout tools, the netlist of the digital circuit being designed can, to a certain extent. On the other hand, the timing restriction information is usually created manually. Since the amount information in the timing restriction information has not been very large, the timing restriction information has been manually generated without problems hitherto. However, recently, the timing restriction information is becoming more complex, and a speed and a scale of the digital circuit is increasing. As a result, it is becoming difficult to manufacture a digital circuit that operates according to a given clock cycle.",
        "Accordingly, there is an increasing demand for a technology for efficiently detecting as many timing exception paths as possible. The timing exception paths include a path of which a delay of a path between arbitrary two sequential circuit elements in the digital circuit is not necessary to be confined to a single clock cycle, such as a multi-cycle path of which the delay may acceptably be two or more clock cycles, and a false path whose delay does not affect the delay of the entire circuit.",
        "In a conventional technology for detecting such timing exception paths from a digital circuit, it is detected whether a path is a timing exception path for each of paths between sequential circuit elements. In another conventional technology, paths between sequential circuit elements are handled in a set, and such detection is performed for each of a combination of the sequential circuit elements in a unit of the combination. Such technologies are disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Nos. 2003-157297 and 2004-171149.",
        "In the conventional technology, in worst cases, an exponential explosion occurs on the path with respect to a circuit scale. Therefore, a calculation time for the detection greatly increases. In addition, when an amount of information on the timing exception path is large, calculation time of timing analysis tools that receive such information also increases.",
        "On the other hand, in another one of the conventional technologies, it is possible to avoid such problems caused by increased number of paths. However, for example, when only some of the paths between arbitrary two sequential circuit elements are the timing exception paths, these timing exception paths cannot be detected.",
        "The timing exception path includes the multi-cycle path and the false path, and analysis for the timing exception path is performed independently for each of the multi-cycle path and the false path. Such analysis is often redundant in terms of the analysis for the timing exception path as a whole, and this also leads to increase of the calculation time.",
        "Recently, for manufacturing digital circuits, there is a demand to efficiently detect the timing exception paths during the circuit design stage with high accuracy, and to shorten a manufacturing period of digital circuits with increasingly complexity.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to solve at least the above conventional problems.",

The value of a gate input signal that uniquely determines an output signal from the output terminal of the gate is termed a control value, while values other than control values are termed non-control values. The value of the output signal of the gate output terminal, which is determined by the control value, is termed a controlled value. For example, the control value at the AND (OR) gate is 0 (1), the non-control value is 1 (0), and the controlled value is 0 (1).",

The settings are FFe.En (1)\u21900 and FFe.EN (2)\u21901, so that, while no value is captured in the multi-cycle at time 2, a value is captured in the multi-cycle at time 3.",
        "The calculator 203 performs an implicative operation to determine allocation of values in the circuit information CKT, which is uniquely determined, from the input value of the enable signal set at step S304 (step S305). The implicative operation is an operation of allocating as many signal values as possible in the circuit information CKT, which is uniquely determined, by transmitting allocated values. A contradiction that arises in the value allocation during the implicative operation indicates that the combination of values that are allocated before the implicative operation is actually impossible. For this combination, there is no need to determine whether there is a multi-cycle.",

In the circuit information CKT, a control signal for selecting a path in a predetermined path set is an input signal having a function of selecting whether the D0 input terminal and the D1 input terminal of the MUX 1 and 2 will both be input terminals for control signals that a path in the path set will pass, or control signals of which significance is equivalent to this, and for selecting a path in the predetermined path set when the value of the signal is 1, and selects another path when the value of the signal is 0.",

Based on the determination, the determining unit 604 determines the path P in the path set F to be a false path.",
        "As shown in FIG. 7, a path-selecting gate, for example, an MUX, which selects a path in the path set F between the FF pair (FFs, FFe) other than the path set M is determined (step S701).",
        "Based on the MUX determined at step S701, the path set F between the FF pair (FFs, FFe) is converted into a path set Pi of MUX paths that ignore gates (for example, AND (OR) gates) other than MUX (step S702). Converting the path set F into the path set Pi extracts only the MUX from the path set F, thereby generating the path set Pi of the MUX paths.",
        "After the path set Pi has been determined at step S702, the false path detector 206 detects whether any unselected MUX paths remain in the path set Pi (step S703). When it is determined that there are unselected MUX paths (\u201cYES\u201d at step S703), an arbitrary MUX path P is selected from the path set Pi (step S704). On the other hand, when it is determined that there are no unselected MUX paths (\u201cNO\u201d at step S703), the processing of step S311 in the flowchart of FIG. 3 ends, and the processing from step S302 to S311 is repeated.",
        "When the MUX path P is selected at step S704, it is determined whether there are any MUX that has not been selected in the MUX path P selected (step S705). When it is determined that there are MUX that have not been selected (\u201cYES\u201d at step S705), the extractor 601 of the false path detector 206 selects an arbitrary MUXG from the MUX that have not been selected (step S706).",
        "When the extractor 601 extracts the MUXG, the setting unit 602 sets the value (control value) of the input signal to the control input terminals that controls the extracted MUXG, depending on whether the MUX path P passes the D1 input terminal or the D0 input terminal of the MUXG (step S707). Processing then returns to step S705, at which it is determined whether any MUX that has not been selected remains.",
        "On the other hand, when it is determined that there are no unselected MUX (\u201cNO\u201d at step S705), processing shifts to step S807 for determination by the judging unit 603. Based on the control value set by the setting unit 602, the judging unit 603 determines whether the value that is allocated as an input signal to the control input terminals of each MUX in MUX path P is actually possible (step S708).",
        "When it is determined that the allocated value is possible (\u201cYES\u201d at step S708), the sequence returns to step S703, and the processing from step S703 to step S708 is repeated. When it is determined that the allocated value is not possible (\u201cNO\u201d at step S708), the determining unit 604 adds the paths in the path set F corresponding to the MUX path P to the timing exception path list L as false paths, based on the determination made by the judging unit 603 (step S709). When the processing at step S709 ends, the sequence returns to step S703 and the processing from step S703 to step S709 is repeated.",
        "The circuit shown in FIG. 4 performs addition (ADD) processing in one clock cycle when the value of the input signal to the MULT input terminal of the circuit is MULT=(0), and performs multiplication (MULT) processing in two clock cycles when MULT=(1).",
        "At step S301 shown in FIG. 3, it is assumed that the circuit information CKT of the circuit shown in FIG. 4 is input by the input unit 201. It is also assumed that FF1 and FF4 are selected as the FF pair (FFs, FFe) at step S303. When the selector 202 selects the FF pair (FF1, FF4), the calculator 203 sets the input values of an enable signal sent to the enable terminal of the FFe for calculating the value-capturing condition data to FF4. EN(1)\u21900, FF4. EN(2)\u21901 at step S304.",
        "When the calculator 203 sets the input value of the enable signal to the enable terminal of FF4, an implicative operation of allocating values is performed at step S305. The circuit shown in FIG. 5 reflects the result of this implicative operation in the circuit shown in FIG. 4. In FIG. 5, the numerical values on each signal line represent values allocated to them, and the numerical values in brackets represent the time. For example, the numerical values \u201c1 (2)\u201d near the Q output terminal of FF7 indicate that the output signal from the Q output terminal of FF7 is 1 (FF7. Q=1) at time 2.",
        "After the calculator 203 performs an implicative operation of allocating values for each signal line, the value allocation for the signal that selects a path between the FF pair (FF1, FF4) is set as the value-capturing condition data C in a subsequent step S306. In the circuit shown in FIG. 5, the input signal to the input terminal of the MUX 2 selector (hereinafter, \u201cC\u201d) is the signal that selects the path from FF1 to FF4. Consequently, a condition of MUX.2 C(2)=1 is set as the value-capturing condition data C that captures the value in a multi-cycle at FF4. The set value-capturing condition data C of MUX. 2 C(2)=1 indicates that multiplication conditions for calculating MULT have been set correctly, since the value of the signal input to the MULT input terminal of the circuit corresponds to MULT(0)=1.",
        "The value-capturing condition data C (MUX. 2 C(2)=1) indicates that the input signal to the D1 input terminal of MUX 2 is selected. Therefore, at step S307, the divider 204 divides the path set between the FF pair (FF1 and FF4) into a path set M of paths that include the D1 input terminal of MUX 2 as a pass point, and a path set F of paths that include the D0 input terminal of MUX 2 as a pass point, based on the value-capturing condition data C.",
        "Having allocated the value-capturing condition data C (MUX. 2 C(2)=1), at step S308, the multi-cycle path detector 205 detect multi-cycle paths in the path set M divided by the divider 204. Since the path set M between the FF pair (FF1, FF4) matches the value-capturing condition data C (MUX. 2 C(2)=1), the fact that all the paths in the path set M are multi-cycle paths is detected at step S309. It can thereby be confirmed that the paths between the FF pair-(FF1, FF4) that pass the D1 input terminal of MUX 2 are multi-cycle paths.",
        "At step S311, the false path detector 206 detects false paths in the path set F, divided from the FF pair (FF1, FF4) at step S307. The path set F passes through the D0 input terminal of the MUX 2, and, includes paths that pass through the AND gate 2 and paths that pass through the AND gate 3 in the circuit shown in FIG. 5. In the circuit shown in FIG. 5, since the paths that pass through the AND gates 1 and 2 include no MUX 1 and 2 having the condition of passing both D1 and D2 input terminals, the false path detector 206 determines that they are not false paths, and does not add them to the timing exception path list L.",
        "FIG. 8 is a circuit diagram of another path-selecting gate in the circuit information that is used in detection processing. While the embodiment described above uses a MUX as the path-selecting gate, one acceptable alternative is a path-selecting gate that includes two AND gates 5 and 6, one INV, and one OR gate, as in the example shown in FIG. 8.",
        "As described above, in the method and the apparatus for detecting a timing exception path, the computer product according to the embodiments of the present invention, a path set that matches the value-capturing condition data relating to a multi-cycle from a set of paths between sequential circuit elements in the circuit being detected is divided, and it is detected whether each of all the paths in the path set divided is a multi-cycle path. Thus, the multi-cycle paths can be efficiently detected even when not all the paths between the sequential circuit elements are multi-cycle paths. Increase of the calculation time can be prevented, since the paths between the sequential circuit elements are detected in a set.",
        "Furthermore, in the method and the apparatus for detecting a timing exception path, and the computer product according to the embodiments of the present invention, a path set that does not match the value-capturing condition data relating to a multi-cycle from a set of paths between sequential circuit elements in the circuit being detected is divided, and it is detected whether each of the paths in the set divided is a false path. Thus, it is possible to efficiently detect paths between the sequential circuit elements in a set, and detect false paths in a set of paths that do not capture values in a multi-cycle between the sequential circuit elements with high accuracy, thereby preventing increase of the calculation time.",
        "Moreover, in the method and the apparatus for detecting a timing exception path, and the computer product according to the embodiments of the present invention, a path set that does not match the value-capturing condition data relating to a multi-cycle from a set of paths between sequential circuit elements in the circuit being detected is divided. Information relating to path-selecting gates in the path set divided is extracted, and information that relates to a combination of possible values for control signals that control the path-selecting gates based on the information relating to them is set. It is determined whether the combination of values is possible based on the information that relate to the combination of set values, and the paths in the path set to be false paths are determined based on the result of the determination. Thus, it is possible to efficiently detect paths between the sequential circuit elements in a set, and detect a set of false paths in a set of paths that do not capture values in a multi-cycle between the sequential circuit elements with high accuracy, thereby preventing increase of the calculation time.",
        "As described above, according to the method and the apparatus for detecting a timing exception path, and the computer product according to the embodiments of the present invention, it is possible to detect timing exception paths between sequential circuit elements efficiently and with high accuracy, and shorten designing time.",
        "The method for detecting a timing exception path described in the above embodiment can be realized by making a computer such as a personal computer, a work station, and a CAD, execute a program that is prepared beforehand. The program is stored in a computer-readable recording medium, such as a hard disk, a flexible disk, a CD-ROM, an MO, a DVD, and the like, and is executed by being read from the recording medium by the computer. The program may be a transmission medium that can be distributed via a network such as the Internet.",
