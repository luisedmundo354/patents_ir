        "The disclosures made herein relate generally to pet food and water dishes, and particularly to pet food and water dishes designed to provide food or water to pets when confined within and transported in a pet carrier or crate. The disclosures herein more particularly relate to pet food and water dishes which incorporate features to prevent contents from spilling over the side of the dish during transmit and which also provide a means of securely fastening the dish to the side of the pet carrier or crate.",
        "Pet food and water dishes of various designs are known and are commonly used. Often pet owners or trainers choose to travel with their pet, sometimes perhaps to visit family, to travel to a distant destination for a vacation, or just perhaps to transport the animal from one location to another, perhaps even to a park or outdoor wooded location for exercise. Additionally, sometimes it may be necessary to transport a pet on public transportation. Pet owners transporting their pets using public transportation means such as planes, trains and busses usually have limited options in transporting their pet. In such cases laws and regulations may require pets to be placed into a pet carrier or some other type of cage, for health, safety and cleanliness reasons, as well as to allow transport of the pet in the luggage area of a plane or bus. Often such excursions with the family pet can take a considerable amount of time during which it is prudent and humane to provide to the animal within the cage a ready supply of drinking water and food in a pet dish. When transporting the pet in a cage, the cage can be subject to substantial jostling and bumping which can result in the spillage of food or water from the pet feeding dish resulting in soiling of the cage as well as the environment surrounding the cage. As pet owners know, typical pet dishes with their low sidewalls, broad flat bottoms and wide top openings easily spill their contents when bumped or tipped, and as such are unsuitable for use in pet carriers and cages. Additionally, typical pet dishes do not provide a means of securely mounting the dish to the cage wall and so are free to slide and move within the cage.",
        "Therefore, a spill resistant water and food dish for pets that is designed for use within a pet carrier or cage, that provides a means of removably securing the dish to a side wall of a pet carrier or cage, that incorporates features to prevent the spillage of food and drinking water into the cage and surrounding environment, such a pet food or water dish design would be useful and novel.",
        "Accordingly, embodiments of the inventive disclosures made herein comprise various embodiments of a spill resistant food and water dish for pets, a dish design that is particularly suited for use with a pet carrier or cage. Pets may typically be cats or dogs, but this disclosure is not limited to use with cats and dogs and is applicable for use with a wide variety of and various sizes of animals.",
        "A first and at least one embodiment of the inventive disclosures made herein comprises a cage mountable spill resistant feeding dish for a household pet animal comprising a feeding dish for holding food or water, the dish comprising: an elongated \u2018D\u2019 shaped dish base structure having one or more cavities therein designed to receive an ice pack or ice to keep the pet food or water chilled. The elongated \u2018D\u2019 shaped dish base structure forms a \u2018U\u2019 shaped exterior sidewall and a substantially flat rectangular back wall having one or more voids there-through into the ice pack cavity. The back wall is attached on opposite edges to opposing edges of the \u2018U\u2019 shaped sidewall. The \u2018D\u2019 shaped top surface of the dish base has a closed bottom depression for holding food or water therein, the depression having cylindrical side walls. A raised cylindrical ring is formed on the top surface of the dish structure, the ring having a cylindrical inside surface joining the cylindrical walls of the depression. The outside surface of the raised ring has a circumferentially threaded portion to receive and threadably engage a feeding dish cover. The back wall of the dish base is provided with a means for removably and supportively mounting the dish to a side wall of a cage or animal carrier. The feeding dish cover of the present invention is provided with features to reduce the opportunity for and chance of spillage of food and water from the dish. The feeding dish cover comprises a generally cylindrical sidewall having circumferential threads on a lower portion of an inside surface. The cover sidewall and threads are sized and fitted to threadably and removably engage the threaded section of the cylindrical ring of the dish base so as to provide a partial closure over the food or water in the dish. The cover having an \u2018O\u2019 shaped top wall further having an inner circumferential edge and an outer circumferential edge, the outer edge attached to the top edge of the cover sidewall. A truncated cone shaped surface having an outer circumferential edge and an inner circumferential edge defining a hole where the cone is truncated, the outer edge of the cone shaped surface secured to the inner surface of the cover sidewall, the inner circumferential edge of the cone sized and adapted to permit the animal to access food in the dish through the feeding hole in the center of the cone, the cone sloping downwardly from periphery edges towards the hole to encourage displaced food to drain back into the dish through the feeding hole.",
        "The variations of the spill resistant dish, cover and access hole can be made in any size to suit the physical head, mouth dimensional requirements of any particular animal. In particular, the feeding hole in the cover cone must be sufficient to allow the animal to reach food or water within the bowl, but not so large as to permit the contents of the bowl to splash out. Additionally a rubber \u2018O\u2019 ring or gasket seal is provided between the cover and the threaded ring of the dish base to provide a leak-proof seal between the cover and the dish.",
        "In another embodiment of the inventive disclosures made herein, the cage mountable spill resistant food feeding dish for a household pet animal comprises a feeding dish for holding food or water, the dish comprising: a generally cylindrical side wall; a threaded section on an upper portion of an outside surface of the side wall; a bottom wall peripherally secured to a bottom edge of said sidewall, said bottom wall together with the sidewall forming a closed bottom dish. A feeding dish cover comprises a generally cylindrical sidewall, the cover sidewall having circumferential threads on a lower portion of an inside surface, the cover sidewall and threads sized and fitted to threadably and removably engage the threaded section of the feeding dish sidewall.

        "FIG. 1 depicts one particular embodiment of spill resistant water and food dish for pets in accordance with the inventive disclosures presented herein. In FIG. 1 the spill resistant water or food dish for pets 1 comprises a \u2018D\u2019 shaped base structure have a \u2018U\u2019 shaped sidewall 2. A substantially rectangular and substantially flat back wall 3 is attached at opposing ends to opposite ends of the \u2018U\u2019 shaped sidewall 2. The back wall is provided with one or more voids there-through into the ice pack cavity 5. The ice pack cavity, generally outlined in FIG. 1 with a dotted line, is closed at the bottom with a bottom surface so as to provide a closed bottom container to hold ice packs or ice to keep the food or water chilled. The \u2018D\u2019 shaped base structure is closed out at the top with a \u2018D\u2019 shaped top surface 22 having a closed bottom depression 7 for holding food therein, the depression having cylindrical side walls 8. A raised cylindrical ring 6 is formed on the \u2018D\u2019 shaped top surface top of the dish base structure, the ring having a cylindrical inside surface joining the cylindrical walls 8 of the closed bottom depression 7. The outside surface of the raised ring 6 is provided with a circumferentially threaded portion to engage a cover.",
        "The rectangular back wall 3 is provided with a means of removably and supportively mounting the spill resistant pet dish to an interior side wall of a pet carrier or cage. In FIG. 1 the means for removably and supportively mounting comprises a threaded screw 9 with a head having ridges 10 to allow finger tightening of the screw, the screw sized and configured to threadably, retentively and removably engage the threaded hole 11 in the back wall 3.",
        "Continuing with FIG. 1, a feeding dish cover 12 comprises a generally cylindrical sidewall 13, the cover sidewall 13 having circumferential threads on a lower portion of an inside surface, the cover sidewall and threads sized and fitted to threadably and removably engage the threaded section of the cylindrical ring 6. \u2018O\u2019 shaped top wall 14 has an inner circumferential edge and an outer circumferential edge, the outer edge is attached to a top edge of the cover sidewall.",
        "Still referring to FIG. 1, the cover is provided with a truncated cone shaped surface 16, the cone shaped surface providing a sloped surface to encourage food or water displaced from within the feeding dish to drain by gravity back into the dish. The truncated cone shaped surface 16 having an outer circumferential edge and an inner circumferential edge defining a feeding hole where the cone is truncated, the outer edge of the cone shaped surface secured to the inner surface of the cover sidewall, the inner circumferential edge of the cone defining a feeding access hole sized and adapted to permit the animal to access food in the dish through the hole in the cone. The cone slopes downwardly from the peripheral side edges of the cover towards the hole to encourage displaced food to drain back into the dish through the hole with the aid of gravity. The cone partially obstructs the top of the dish holding food or water, thereby further preventing the water or food from spilling out or otherwise unintentionally leaving the pet dish. More specific details about the spill prevention features of this inventive disclosure are provided further down below.",
        "Now referring to FIG. 2 and to the spill resistant features of the present inventive disclosure. FIG. 2 is sectional view of the feeding dish cover 12 in which one half of the cover has been cut away along an axis of symmetry through the center of the cover as an aid in illustration of other spill prevention features of the present embodiment. Feeding dish cover 12 comprises a cylindrical outside sidewall 13, an \u2018O\u2019 shaped cover top wall 14, a spill limiting inside sidewall 15, an inner cone shaped surface 18, and outer cone shaped surface 19, a rubber or pliable gasket 21 provides a water tight seal between the ledge 23 of the cover and the dish, and a feeding access hole 20. In use, food or water is present below the cover and features of the cover cooperate to prevent water and food from splashing out of the dish through the feeding hole when the dish is bumped or displaced. As discussed earlier, gasket 21 provides a water tight seal between the cover and the food or water in the pet dish. The region over the perimeter portions of the food dish are covered by the inner cone shaped surface 18. In the case of water in the dish, bumping or jarring the dish causes a wave-like feature in the water that would tend to splash or ride over the dish walls at the perimeter sidewall of the dish. With the feeding dish cover installed on the dish, the water tends to splash against the inner cone shaped surface 18 near the periphery side walls, and is deflected back into the bowl. Liquids or food that may become displaced from the bowl through the feeding access hole 20 tend to have low velocity if they manage to escape through the center region of the bowl. This low escape velocity in a region over the center of the dish can be illustrated with a thought experiment based on every day experiences. An experiment with a glass half full of water will demonstrate that when the glass is displaced horizontally a wave is created in the glass, the wave moving along the direction of displacement. This wave causes the water level on the side of the glass nearest the direction of the displacement to initially drop in level, and similarly the water level on the opposite side of the glass initially rises in level. More importantly, one can observe that the water at the center of the glass along a line perpendicular to the direction of displacement does not substantially rise or fall in level, meaning no to low displacement or velocity for water or food particles in that region. This low energy or low displacement region lies under the feeding hole in FIG. 2. By this arrangement food or water ejected from a horizontal bump or horizontal movement of the pet feeding dish will tend to have low velocity even if ejected at the center feeding hole. The outer cone shaped surface 19 and spill limiting inside cover sidewall 15 will tend to capture spills and return the material to the feeding dish with the aid of gravity, thereby reducing or elimination spillage.",
        "In FIG. 1 the depicted embodiment the pet dish is formed integrally with the base. A variation of the FIG. 1 embodiment yields another embodiment of the present inventive disclosure. The FIG. 1 embodiment is modified to have a pet dish as a separate bowl that is removable from the base through the hole in the \u2018D\u2019 shaped top surface 22. The cover 12 is threadably engaged onto mating threads on the removable dish outside sidewall, permitting the dish with the cover to be removed from the base and used separately from the elongated \u2018D\u2019 shaped base structure 2. In this case the base structure serves only to support the dish and cover in a cage or carrier, and serves also as a holder for ice packs or ice to keep the contents of the dish chilled.",
