The polymerization process proceeds with enhanced monomer to polymer conversion efficiency at low temperatures. In particular, this invention relates to stable free radical-mediated polymerization processes which provide homopolymers, random copolymers, block copolymers, multiblock copolymers, graft copolymers and the like, at enhanced rates of polymerization and enhanced monomer to polymer conversions at low temperatures.",
        "The polymerization processes and resin products of the present invention are useful in many applications, including a variety of specialty applications, such as for the preparation of block copolymers which are useful as compatibilizing agents for polymer blends, or dispersing agents for coating systems or for the preparation of narrow molecular weight resins or oligomers for use in coating technologies and thermoplastic films or as toner resins and liquid immersion development ink resins or ink additives used for electrophotographic imaging processes.",
        "There are numerous documents in the literature describing the controlled radical polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers using alkoxyamines or nitroxides.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,581,429 to Solomon et al., issued Apr. 8, 1986, discloses a free radical polymerization process which controls the growth of polymer chains to produce short chain or oligomeric homopolymers and copolymers, including block and graft copolymers. The process employs an initiator having the formula (in part) R\u2032R\u2033N\u2014O\u2014X, where X is a free radical species capable of polymerizing unsaturated monomers. The reactions typically have low conversion rates. Specifically mentioned radical R\u2032R\u2033N\u2014O. groups are derived from 1,1,3,3 tetraethylisoindoline, 1,1,3,3 tetrapropylisoindoline, 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine, 2,2,5,5 tetramethylpyrrolidine or di-t-butylamine. However, the suggested compounds do not fulfill all requirements. Particularly the polymerization of acrylates does not proceed fast enough and/or the monomer to polymer conversion is not as high as desired.",
        "Recently other attempts to develop new polymerization regulators have been published. WO 98/4408 and WO 98/30601 disclose heterocyclic compounds suitable for controlled polymerization processes. WO 98/13392 discloses open chain alkoxyamines which are derived from NO gas or from nitroso compounds.",
        "WO 00/07981 discloses a variety of open chain alkoxyamine compounds, which have no or at most only one electron withdrawing group at the C-atom in \u03b2-position to the nitrogen atom. These compounds are stable at low temperature and decompose readily at elevated temperature.",
        "Surprisingly, it has now been found that higher alkyl and phenyl substitution patterns at the carbon atom in \u03b1 position to the nitrogen atom lead to initiators/regulators, which allow controlled radical polymerization at a temperature of 100\u00b0 C. or below. Due to the higher steric hindrance around the nitrogen atom, compared to prior art compounds, high conversions are achievable even at temperatures as low as 100\u00b0 C. This makes the compounds particularly useful for controlled radical polymerization processes under aqueous conditions at ambient pressure. So far there exists no regulator/initiator which would allow efficient radical polymerization under such conditions, Polymerization of monomers with the instant compounds results in a polymer or copolymer of narrow polydispersity and high monomer to polymer conversion even at temperatures below 100\u00b0 C. High conversions are achieved even in short reaction times.",
