        "This invention relates to novel compounds and their use as pharmaceuticals, particularly as Raf kinase inhibitors for the treatment of neurotraumatic diseases, cancer chronic neurodegeneration, pain, migraine and cardiac hypertrophy.",
        "Raf protein kinases are key components of signal transduction pathways by which specific extracellular stimuli elicit precise cellular responses in mammalian cells. Activated cell surface receptors activate ras/rap proteins at the inner aspect of the plasma-membrane which in turn recruit and activate Raf proteins. Activated Raf proteins phosphorylate and activate the intracellular protein kinases MEK1 and MEK2. In turn, activated MEKs catalyse phosphorylation and activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). A variety of cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates of activated MAPK are known which directly or indirectly contribute to the cellular response to environmental change. Three distinct genes have been identified in mammals that encode Raf proteins; A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf (also known as Raf-1) and isoformic variants that result from differential splicing of mRNA are known.",
        "Inhibitors of Raf kinases have been suggested for use in disruption of tumor cell growth and hence in the treatment of cancers, e.g. histiocytic lymphoma, lung adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer and pancreatic and breast carcinoma; also in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders associated with neuronal degeneration resulting from ischemic events, including cerebral ischemia after cardiac arrest, stroke and multi-infarct dementia and also after cerebral ischemic events such as those resulting from head injury, surgery and/or during childbirth; also in chronic neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease; also in the treatment of pain, migraine and cardiac hypertrophy.",

For example, Suzuki coupling of pyridine-4-boronic acid with 2,3-dibromofuran-5-carboxylic acid t-butyl ester (1) preferentially results in the formation of the 2-(4-pyridyl) derivative (2). Subsequent Suzuki reaction with an indanone boronic acid derivative (3, wherein PG is O, N\u2014OMe or another ketone protecting group) then generates the derivative (4).

        "Activity of human recombinant B-Raf protein was assessed in vitro by assay of the incorporation of radiolabelled phosphate to recombinant MAP kinase kinase (MEK), a known physiologic substrate of B-Raf. Catalytically active human recombinant B-Raf protein was obtained by purification from Sf9 insect cells infected with a human B-Raf recombinant baculovirus expression vector. To ensure that all substrate phosphorylation resulted from B-Raf activity, a catalytically inactive form of MEK was utilised. This protein was purified from bacterial cells expressing mutant inactive MEK as a fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase (GST-kdMEK).\n\n    Method: Standard assay conditions of B-Raf catalytic activity utilised 3 ug of GST-kdMEK, 10 uM ATP and 2 uCi 33P-ATP, 50 mM MOPS, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1M sucrose, 10 mM MgCl2 plus 0.1% dimethylsulphoxide (containing compound where appropriate) in a total reaction volume of 30 ul. Reactions were incubated at 25\u00b0 C. for 90 minutes and reactions terminated by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 50 uM. 10 ul of reaction was spotted to P81 phosphocellulose paper and air dried. Following four washes in ice cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, 0.5% phosphoric acid, papers were air dried prior to addition of liquid scintillant and measurement of radioactvity in a scintillation counter.\n    Results: The compounds of the examples were found to be effective in inhibiting B-Raf mediated phosphorylation of GST-kdMEK substrate having IC50's of <3 \u03bcM.

        "Organotypic cultures provide an intermediate between dissociated neuronal cell cultures and in-vivo models of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). The majority of glial-neuronal interactions and neuronal circuitry are maintained in cultured hippocampal slices, so facilitating investigation of the patterns of death among differing cell types in a model that resembles the in vivo situation. These cultures allow the study of delayed cellular damage and death 24 hours, or more, post-insult and permit assessment of the consequences of long-term alterations in culture conditions. A number of laboratories have reported delayed neuronal damage in response to OGD in organotypic cultures of the hippocampus (Vornov et al., Stroke, 1994, 25, 57-465; Newell et al., Brain Res., 1995, 676, 38-44). Several classes of compounds have been shown to protect in this model, including EAA antagonists (Strasser et al., Brain Res., 1995, 687, 167-174), Na channel blockers (Tasker et al., J. Neurosci., 1992, 12, 98-4308) and Ca channel blockers (Pringle et al., Stroke, 1996, 7, 2124-2130). To date, relatively little is known of the roles of intracellular kinase mediated signalling pathways in neuronal cell death in this model.\n\n    Method: Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared using the method of Stoppini et al., J. Neurosci. Methods, 1995, 37, 173-182. Briefly, 400 micron sections prepared from hippocampi of 7-8 day postnatal Sprague Dawley rats are cultured on semiporous membranes for 9-12 days. OGD is then induced by incubation in serum and glucose-free medium in an anaerobic chamber for 45 minutes. Cultures are then returned to the air/CO2 incubator for 23 hours before analysis. Propidium iodide (PI) is used as an indicator of cell death. PI is non toxic to neurones and has been used in many studies to ascertain cell viability. In damaged neurons PI enters and binds to nucleic acids. Bound PI shows increased emission at 635 nm when excited at 540 nm. One PI fluorescence image and one white light image are taken and the proportion of cell death analysed. The area of region CA1 is defined from the white light image and superimposed over the PI image. The PI signal is thresholded and area of PI damage expressed as a percentage of the CA1 area. Correlation between PI fluorescence and histologically confirmed cell death has been validated previously by Niss1-staining using cresyl fast violet (Newell et al., J. Neurosci., 1995, 15, 7702-7711).",

The next day, compounds were diluted in RPMI containing 100 micrograms/ml gentamicin, at twice the final required concentration, from 10 mM stock solutions in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). One hundred microliters per well of these dilutions were added to the 100 microliters of media currently on the cell plates. RPMI containing 0.6% DMSO was added to control wells.

Percent viability of cells in each well was calculated from these data (having been corrected for background absorbance). It was equal to\n\n100\u00d7(A450 test well/A450 untreated control well),\n\nthe A450s being averages of triplicate determinations. IC50 was that concentration of compound that reduced cell viability to 50% of control (untreated) viability, as determined from plots of concentration vs percent viability.\n\nPreparation of XTT/PMS solution (immediately before assay).\n\n    \n    \n        For each 96-well plate, 8 mg XTT (2,3-bis[2-Methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) (Sigma Chemical Co.) per plate was dissolved in 100 ul DMSO. 3.9 ml H2O was added to dissolve XTT and 20 ul of PMS (phenazine methosulfate, Sigma Chemical Co.) stock solution (30 mg/ml) was added from frozen aliquoted stock solution (10 mg of PMS in 3.3 ml phosphate buffered saline (vitrogen/Life Technologies). (These stocks are routinely frozen at \u221220\u00b0 C. until use).\n\nNormal human foreskin fibroblasts (BFF) are the control normal cell line that should not be inhibited or at least much less sensitive.",
