        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The invention relates to new photoresists, particularly photoresists that can be applied and imaged with reduced undesired outgassing and/or as thick coating layers. Preferred resists of the invention are chemically-amplified positive-acting resists that contain one or more photoacid generator compounds and a resin component.",
        "2. Background",
        "Photoresists are photosensitive films used for transfer of images to a substrate. A coating layer of a photoresist is formed on a substrate and the photoresist layer is then exposed through a photomask to a source of activating radiation. The photomask has areas that are opaque to activating radiation and other areas that are transparent to activating radiation. Exposure to activating radiation provides a photoinduced chemical transformation of the photoresist coating to thereby transfer the pattern of the photomask to the photoresist-coated substrate. Following exposure, the photoresist is developed to provide a relief image that permits selective processing of a substrate. A photoresist can be either positive-acting or negative-acting. Photoresist compositions are described in Deforest, Photoresist Materials and Processes, McGraw Hill Book Company, New York, ch. 2, 1975 and by Moreau, Semiconductor Lithography, Principles, Practices and Materials, Plenum Press, New York, ch. 2 and 4.",
        "Ion implantation techniques have been employed for doping semiconductor wafers. By this approach, an ion beam implanter generates an ion beam within an evacuated (low pressure) chamber, and the ions are directed and \u201cimplanted\u201d to the wafer.",
        "Significant problems arise however with current ion implantation methods. For instance, imaged coatings of current photoresists that serve as masking layers often exhibit significant \u201coutgassing\u201d of volatile materials as a result of the ion bombardment and low pressure processing conditions. Such outgassing will compromise processing conditions, including undesired modulating of the operating pressure of the reaction vessel, deposition of organic materials on the optical equipment, and the like.",
        "Certain efforts have been made to address such outgassing. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,858,623 reports ion-pretreatmnent of a photoresist layer. That approach adds more processing time and costs and would not be applicable to many resist systems. U.S. Pat. No. 6,458,430 also reports an ion-pretreatment of a photoresist layer to attempt to minimize undesired outgassing during subsequent ion implantation.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 6,369,874 reports a so-called outgassing mitigation apparatus in which to conduct implantation processes. That approach also adds costs and necessitates use of additional equipment.",
        "In certain processes for semiconductor wafer manufacture, use of a photoresist as a thick coating layer (e.g. at a dried (post soft-bake) thickness of 1 or 2 microns or greater is desirable. For instance, thick film photoresists are used for the formation of semiconductor bumps (protruded electrodes) and for rewiring. Highly useful thick film photoresists are disclosed in U.S. pat. application Ser. No. 2003/0027086 to Thackeray et al.",
        "Many reported thick film compositions however are inadequate for current needs. For example, current compositions are designed for longer wavelength imaging such as 365 nm or other wavelengths in excess of 300 nm such as used with a quinone diazide photoactive component, rather than shorter wavelength imaging such as sub-300 nm particularly 248 nm, which is required to higher performance applications. See U.S. pat. applications Ser. Nos. 2003/0059706 and 2003/0039931.",
        "It thus would be desirable to have new photoresists that could provide reduced outgassing, particularly under ion implantation processes. It also would be desirable to have new photoresists that could be effectively processed as thick films.",
        "We have now found new photoresist compositions and methods that can provide reduced outgassing under vigorous processing conditions, such as ion implantation processing.",
        "Additionally, preferred photoresists of the invention can be effectively applied as a thick coating film, e.g. at dried layer (post soft-bake) thicknesses of in excess of 1 micron, preferably in excess of about 1.5, 2, 3, 4 or even 5 microns.",
        "Resists of the invention can be imaged at short wavelengths, including sub-300 nm such as 248 nm, to provide highly resolved thick layer relief images.",
        "More particularly, in a first aspect, chemically-amplified (deblocking) positive-acting photoresists are provided that generate a reduced molar amount of volatile organic material (cleavage product) upon a photoacid-induced deblocking reaction.",
        "In one approach, a blocked acidic moiety, e.g. an acid blocked as an ester or alcohol blocked as an acetal, is spaced by a linker from the polymer backbone. It has been found that such spacing increases the acidity of the deblocked group. More particularly, the deblocking group may be linked by a chain of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more atoms such as carbon or a hetero atom (N, O or S) to a group such as polymerized styrene or vinylphenol that forms the polymer backbone.",
        "By thus increasing the acidicity of photoacid-labile groups, the relative amount of the photoacid-labile groups can be decreased in the resin without compromising contrast levels. For example, a resin can be employed that comprises units that contain photoacid labile groups in an amount of 20 mole percent or less, based on total units of the resin, or even lower levels such as 15, 12, 10, 8, or 5 or less mole percent of units that contain photoacid labile groups, based on total units of the resin.",
        "In general, preferred deblocking resins that are used in positive resists of the invention contain less than about 12, 10, 8, 7, or 5 or less mole percent of units that contain photoacid labile groups, based on total units of the resin.",
        "Such a reduced amount of photoacid-labile groups may be provided by any of several approaches. For instance, a higher order polymer may be employed, i.e. a terpolymer (three distinct repeat units), tetrapolymer (four distinct repeat units) or pentapolymer (five distinct repeat units), or other polymer that has more than one or two distinct repeat units.",
        "Preferred polymers of this type may comprise a repeat unit that does not comprise a photoacid-labile group, or that does not comprise other groups that promote aqueous base developer solubility such as hydroxy, carboxy, sulfonamide and the like. Thay is, such groups are generally intert lithographically and do react with acid, exposure radiation or thermally (generally less than 170\u00b0 C.) under typical lithographic processing (pre-exposure bake, exposure, post-exposure bake and development steps). For instance, preferred inert repeat units of this type include phenyl; naphthyl; cyclohexyl; carbon alicyclic such as cyclic groups having 3 to about 20 carbon atoms e.g. adamantyl, norbomyl, fenchyl, cyclohexyl, cycopentyl, and the like; acyclic alkyl such as C1-20alkyl e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl and the like; alkoxy and other heteroalkyl such as C1-20heteroalkyl e.g. methoxy, ethylthio, butoxy, and the like, all of which may be optionally substituted with non-volatile or non-reactive groups such as halogen, C1-12alkyl, C1-12alkoxy and the like.",
        "Use of such relatively inert polymer groups can facilitate a lowered amount of deblocking groups, particularly by enabling balancing of dissolution properties provided by photoacid-labile groups and other non-deblocking groups that enhance dissolution in aqueous base such as phenol, fluorinated alcohol and the like.",
        "In another approach of this aspect of the invention, deblocking groups are employed that remain covalently linked to the polymer structure after a photoacid-induced deblocking reaction. Such deblocking groups may have multiple covalent linkages to the polymer prior to deblocking, e.g. the photoacid-acid labile may be a cyclic group linked to the polymer, where the photoacid-induced deblocking reaction provides an acidic group through (or by) ring opening, without liberating any volatile species. For example, a \u2014COOH may be provided such as by opening of a lactone; \u2014OH such as by cleavage of a cyclic ether; etc.",
        "In another approach, a photoresist composition may be employed that comprise one or more resist components that are covalently linked by a group that can be cleaved by exposure and/or photogenerated acid. For example, a resin component can be employed wherein the resin is crosslinked by an acid-labile moiety that provides a covalently linked acidic moiety upon photoinduced cleavage, e.g. a resin system linked as follows: resin\u2014C6H4\u2014C(CH3)2\u2014O(C\u2550O)-resin, which can be provided by reaction of the resin with a monomer of the following formula: CH2\u2550CH\u2014C6H4\u2014C(CH3)2\u2014O(C\u2550O)\u2014CH\u2550CH2.",
        "In a related aspect, a photoacid generator may be covalently linked to another resist component so that generation of volatile species are minimized upon photoactivation of the acid generator. For instance, the photoacid generator compound may be covalently linked to a resist resin.",
        "In a yet another approach of this aspect of the invention, photoresists are provided that contain a component with photoacid-labile groups, wherein the photoacid-labile group generates a relatively large cleavage product, particularly a cleavage product that comprises 5 or more carbon atoms and/or a single or multiple ring structure. Preferred leaving groups will have a molecular volume of at least about 125 cubic angstroms (\u212b3). Preferred are groups that comprise an acyclic moiety with multiple branches or alicyclic hydrocarbon groups that comprise one or preferably has two or more fused or bridged rings, such as optionally substituted fenchyl groups, particularly ethyl fenchyl; optionally substituted alkyl adamantyl, particularly a methyladamantyl leaving group (where the ester oxygen is linked to the tertiary carbon of the methyladamantyl moiety); optionally substituted tricyclo decanyl; optionally substituted pinanyl; and the like.",
        "Such group also can provide reduced outgassing, including by a \u201cshielding\u201d effect where the relatively bulky cleavage products are retained within the polymer matrix.",
        "In an additional aspect of the invention, a photoresist coating layer may be treated (but not by ion bombardment) in order to minimize undesired outgassing of resist material, e.g. as may be possible during subsequent ion implantation processing. In particular, a resist may comprise an outgassing-promoting substance such as acid source (e.g. an acid or acid generator compound such as a photoacid generator or thermal acid generator), and the resist is treated (e.g. thermally or by radiation such as by a flood exposure) after development to remove any volatile groups prior to ion implantation processing, or other processing. Preferably, an acid generator is employed, especially a thermal acid generator compound that will generate acid during a post-development thermal treatment but not during prior lithographic processing.",
        "In another aspect, an imaged photoresist coating layer may be coated in order to minimize undesired outgassing of resist material, e.g. as may be possible during subsequent ion implantation processing. For example, the imaged coating (typically the resist layer also has been developed) may be treated to provide a outer coating layer to encapsulate materials that could outgas during subsequent ion implantation processing. A preferred approach is treatment of the developed resist image with a material that will preferably react and/or adhere to the resist image rather than the substrate areas bared upon development. For instance, the developed resist image can be treated with a solyl reagent such as trimethylsilyl chloride.",
        "In a yet further aspect of the invention, particularly to apply a thick photoresist coating layer such as a dried layer thickness in excess of 1 or 2 microns, one or more components of the resist can be modified to provide enhanced transparency to exposure radiation.",
        "In particular, in this aspect, preferred photoacid generator compounds will not comprises any aromatic moieties.",
        "Additionally, a resist resin may be employed that comprises repeat units of phenolic or other aromatic groups, but also contain repeat units that are free of any aromatic substitution such as may be provided by polymerization or vinylcyclohexane or vinylcyclohexanol or other alicyclic group, or by polymerization of an acrylate group. Preferably, at least about 10 mole percent of the total polymer repeat units will be free of any aromatic substitution, more preferably at least about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 or even 70 mole percent of total repeat units will be free of any aromatic substitution.",
        "In a yet further aspect of the invention, particularly to apply a thick photoresist coating layer such as a dried layer thickness in excess of 1 or 2 microns, a photoresist composition may be formulated with one or more lower viscosity solvents. More particularly, preferred are linear ketone solvents such as hexanone and heptanone as well as cyclic ketones such as cyclohexanone and cycloheptanone and esters such as a lactate e.g. methyl lactate and ethyl lactate.",
        "The invention further comprises articles of manufacture comprising substrates such as a microelectronic wafer having coated thereon the photoresists and relief images of the invention. The invention also includes methods to manufacture microelectronic wafers and other articles.",
        "Additionally, as discussed, in a preferred aspect, the invention provided informed ion implantation processing. Such a process may include implanting dopant ions (e.g. Group III and/or V ions such as boron, arsenic, phosphorus and the like) into a surface of a substrate (e.g. semiconductor wafer) having thereon an organic photoresist as disclosed which serves as a mask. The resist-masked substrate may be placed in a reaction chamber which can provide reduced pressure and a plasma of ions from an ionizable source. Those ions include dopants as mentioned which are electrically active when implanted into the substrate. Voltages may be applied in the reaction chamber (such as through electrically conductive chamber walls) to selectively implant the dopant ions.",
        "Other aspects of the invention are disclosed infra.",
        "As discussed above, we have now found new photoresist compositions and methods that can provide reduced outgassing under vigorous processing conditions.",
        "Additionally, preferred photoresists of the invention can be effectively applied a thick coating film, e.g. at dried layer (post soft-bake, pre-exposure measurement) thicknesses of in excess of 1 micron, more typically a dried layer thickness of about 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5 microns or more, or even 6 or 7 microns or more. Resist layers can be employed that have very significant dried layer thicknesses. For at least some applications, it may not be necessary to apply and process resist layers that are in excess of about 10 or more microns dry layer thickness. As referred to herein, dry layer thickness is the thickness of a liquid photoresist composition that has been spin-coated onto a substrate (e.g., silicon microelectronic wafer) and dried by exposure to 110\u00b0 C. for 60 seconds.",
        "Resists can be imaged at short wavelengths in accordance with the invention, including sub-300 nm such as 248 nm or 193 nm, to provide highly resolved thick layer relief images.",
        "More particularly, in preferred aspects, the invention includes methods for providing an ion-implanted semiconductor substrate, which comprise providing a semiconductor substrate having coated thereon a relief image of chemically-amplified positive-acting photoresist composition, wherein the photoresist comprises a resin that comprises, prior to photoactivation, photoacid-labile moieties that are spaced by at least 1 atom from the resin backbone; and applying ions (particularly high energy e.g. >20 eV, reduced pressure) implanting of dopant ions such as argon, boron, boron fluoride, arsenic, phosphorus and/or nitrogen ions) to the substrate. More preferable, the the photoacid-labile moieties are spaced by at least 2 atoms from the resin backbone, or even at least 3, 4, 5 or 6 atoms from the resin backbone.",

        "As discussed, various moieties of resin units, PAGS, and other components of resists of the invention may be optionally substituted, typically 1, 2, or 3 positions by one or more suitable groups such as e.g. halogen (particularly F, Cl or Br); C1-8 alkyl; C1-8 alkoxy; C2-8 alkenyl; C2-8 alkynyl; hydroxyl; alkanoyl such as a C1-6 alkanoyl e.g. acyl; carbocyclic aryl such as phenyl; and the like, although multiple carbon-carbon bonds and aromatic groups will be less preferred due to excessive absorbance of exposure radiation.",
        "Preferred substituent groups of substituted groups of resins, PAGs, plasticizers, and other components of resists of the invention include or consist of at least one halogen atom, preferably fluorine such as fluorinated C1-12alkyl, perfluoroC1-12alkyl, and perfluoroC1-12alkylene, fluorinated C3-8cycloalkyi, and fluorinated ethers (including C1-12 alkoxy) and esters (including C1-12 esters) including fluorinated cyclic ethers and fluorinated cyclic esters.",
        "As used herein, the term alkyl, alkynyl and alkynyl unless otherwise modified refers to linear, branched and cyclic groups, although of course cyclic groups will comprise at least three carbon ring members. Alkoxy groups of resist components suitably have 1 to about 16 carbons and 1, 2, 3 or 4 alkoxy linkages. Suitable alkanoyl groups have 1 to about 16 carbons and one or more carbonyl groups, typically 1, 2 or 3 carbonyl groups. Carbocyclic aryl as used herein refers to non-hetero aromatic groups that have 1 to 3 separate or fused rings and 6 to about 18 carbon ring members and may include phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, acenaphthyl, phenanthracyl and the like. Phenyl and naphthyl are often preferred. Suitable heteroaromatic or heteroaryl groups will have 1 to 3 rings, 3 to 8 ring members in each ring and from 1 to about 3 hetero atoms (N, O or S). Specifically suitable heteroaromatic or heteroaryl groups include e.g. courmarinyl, quinolinyl, pyridyl, pyrimdinyl, furyl, pyrrolyl, thienyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, imidazolyl, indolyl, benzofuranyl and benzothiazole.",
        "The resists of the invention can be readily prepared by those skilled in the art. For example, a photoresist composition of the invention can be prepared by dissolving the components of the photoresist in a suitable solvent such as, for example, ethyl lactate, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, propylene glycol monomethyl ether; propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate and 3-ethoxyethyl propionate; 2-heptanone and cyclohexanone. Typically, the solids content of the composition varies between about 5 and 35 percent by weight of the total weight of the photoresist composition. The resin binder and, photoactive components should be present in amounts sufficient to provide a film coating layer and formation of good quality latent and relief images. See the example which follows for exemplary preferred amounts of resist components.",
        "The compositions of the invention are used in accordance with generally known procedures. The liquid coating compositions of the invention are applied to a substrate such as by spinning, dipping, roller coating or other conventional coating technique. When spin coating, the solids content of the coating solution can be adjusted to provide a desired film thickness based upon the specific spinning equipment utilized, the viscosity of the solution, the speed of the spinner and the amount of time allowed for spinning.",
        "The resist compositions of the invention are suitably applied to substrates conventionally used in processes involving coating with photoresists. For example, the composition may be applied over silicon wafers or silicon wafers coated with silicon dioxide for the production of microprocessors and other integrated circuit components. Aluminum-aluminum oxide, gallium arsenide, ceramic, quartz, copper, glass substrates and the like are also suitably employed.",
        "The resists and methods of the invention are particularly use in e.g. the manufacture of thin film heads (e.g. 3 to 5 \u03bcm), magnetic disks, CD masks, and back-end implants.",
        "Following coating of the photoresist onto a surface, it is dried by heating to remove the solvent until preferably the photoresist coating is tack free. Thereafter, it is imaged through a mask in conventional manner. The exposure is sufficient to effectively activate the photoactive component of the photoresist system to produce a patterned image in the resist coating layer and, more specifically, the exposure energy typically ranges from about 1 to 100 mJ/cm2, dependent-upon the exposure tool and the components of the photoresist composition.",
        "As discussed above, coating layers of the resist compositions of the invention are preferably photoactivated by a short exposure wavelength, particularly a sub-300 and sub-200 nm such as 248 nm 193 nm and 157 nm. 248 nm imaging is particularly preferred.",
        "Following exposure, the film layer of the composition is preferably baked under relatively mild conditions, particularly a post-exposure bake of about 110\u00b0 C.",
        "The post-exposure bake also is relatively short in duration, e.g. the imaged coating is heated under such mild conditions for no more than about 3 minutes, more preferably no more than about 2, 1.5, 1, 0.75 or 0.5 minutes.",
        "After the post-exposure bake, the resist layer may be developed to provide a relief image, e.g. by treating the coating layer with an aqueous alkaline solution such as a tetra-alkyl ammonium hydroxide solution; various amine solutions preferably a 0.26 N tetramethylammonium hydroxide, such as ethyl amine, n-propyl amine, diethyl amine, di-n-propyl amine, triethyl amine, or methyldiethyl amine; alcohol amines such as diethanol amine or triethanol amine; cyclic amines such as pyrrole, pyridine, etc. Plasma development also may be employed. In general, development is in accordance with procedures recognized in the art.",
        "Following development, the photoresist may be thermally treated to remove any potential volatile groups, particularly by thermal treatment at temperatures in excess of the pre-exposure or post-exposure bakes. While such post-development may be dictated by the activation temperature of a thermal acid generator of the resist, suitable post-development treatment include heating to about 150\u00b0 C. or 160\u00b0 C. for 1 or 2 minutes.",
        "After development and any post-development thermal cure, an ion implant process may be conducted, e.g. by bombardment of the substrate with resist relief image with one or more dopant ions such as argon, boron, boron fluoride, arsenic, phosphorus and/or nitrogen, with arsenic, phosphorus and/or boron being more typically employed. The ion implanting is preferably conducted under high energy conditions, e.g. 20 eV or more, such as 40, 50, or 80 eV or more, and preferably under reduced pressure in a chamber.",
        "Thereafter, the developed substrate may be selectively processed on those areas bared of resist, for example by chemically etching or plating substrate areas bared of resist in accordance with procedures known in the art. For the manufacture of microelectronic substrates, e.g., the manufacture of silicon dioxide wafers, suitable etchants include a gas etchant, e.g. a halogen plasma etchant such as a chlorine or fluorine-based etchant such a Cl2 or CF4/CHF3 etchant applied as a plasma stream. After such processing, resist may be removed from the processed substrate using known stripping procedures.",
        "As discussed above, photoresists of the invention are particularly useful to form metal bumps on a semiconductor wafer. Such processing can include: a) disposing on a semiconductor wafer a photoresist of the invention, preferably to provide a thick film coating layer such as a dried resist coating layer of 50 \u03bcm or greater; c) imagewise exposing the layer of photosensitive composition to actinic radiation, including sub-300 nm radiation particularly 248 nm ; d) developing the exposed layer of photosensitive composition to provide patterned areas; e) depositing a metal into the patterned areas; and f) removing the exposed photosensitive composition to provide a semiconductor wafer having metal bumps.",
        "In such bump-forming methods, the photoresist layer is imaged so as to form apertures such as vias in the photosensitive layer. In such process, the photosensitive layer is disposed on a conductive layer on the electronic device. Exposure of the photosensitive composition and subsequent development provides defined holes (vias) in the photosensitive composition and exposes the underlying conductive layer. Accordingly, the next step of the process is to deposit metal or metal alloy bumps with the defined holes (vias). Such metal deposition may be by electroless or electrolytic deposition processes. Electrolytic metal deposition is preferred. In an electrolytic metal deposition process, the electronic device substrate, i.e. semiconductor wafer, functions as the cathode.",
        "Prior to deposition of a metal or metal alloy, such as that suitable as a solder, a conductive layer such as copper or nickel may be deposited by sputtering, electroless deposition and the like, to form the under-bump-metal. Such under-bump-metal layer is typically from 1000 to 50,000 \u212b in thickness and acts as a wettable foundation to the subsequently plated solder bump.",
        "A wide variety of metals may be deposited electrolessly, including, but not limited to, copper, tin-lead, nickel, gold, silver, palladium, and the like. Suitable metals and metal alloys that may be deposited electrolytically include, but are not limited to, copper, tin, tin-lead, nickel, gold, silver, tin-antimony, tin-copper, tin-bismuth, tin-indium, tin-silver, palladium, and the like. Such metal plating baths are well known to those skilled in the art and are readily available from a variety of sources, such as Shipley Company, Marlborough, Mass.",
        "In one embodiment, the metal deposits on the semiconductor wafer are useful as solder bumps. Accordingly, it is preferred that the metal bumps are solderable metals and metal alloys, such as tin, tin-lead, tin-copper, tin-silver, tin-bismuth, tin-copper-bismuth, tin-copper-silver, and the like. Suitable metals and metal alloys for solder bump formation are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,186,383; 5,902,472; 5,990,564; 6,099,713; and 6,013,572, as well as European Patent Application No. EP 1 148 548 (Cheung et al.), all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Exemplary metals and metal alloys include, but are not limited to: tin; tin-copper alloy having less than 2% wt copper and preferably about 0.7% wt copper; a tin-silver alloy having less than 20% wt silver and preferably from 3.5 to 10% wt silver; a tin bismuth alloy having from 5 to 25% wt bismuth and preferably about 20% wt bismuth; and a tin-silver-copper alloy having less than 5% wt silver and preferably about 3.5% wt silver, less than 2% wt copper and preferably about 0.7% wt copper, and the balance being tin. In one embodiment, the metal alloys used for solder bumps are lead-free, i.e. they contain \u226610 ppm of lead.",
        "In general, suitable electrolytic metal plating baths are acidic and contain acid, water a soluble form of the metal or metals to be deposited and optionally one or more organic additives, such as brighteners (accelerators), carriers (suppressors), levelers, ductility enhancers, wetting agents, bath stabilizers (particularly for tin-containing baths), grain refiners and the like. The presence, type and amount of each optional component varies depending upon the particular metal plating bath used. Such metal plating baths are generally commercially available, such as from Shipley Company.",
        "Binary alloys may be deposited from a single bath, as in the case of tin-copper, tin-bismuth, tin-silver, tin-lead and the like, or may be deposited as individual layers from multiple plating baths and reflowed to form and alloy. Such reflow technique is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,013,572. Such reflow is typically performed after removal of the remaining photosensitive composition.",
        "In such a process, the resist composition functions as a protective layer to areas that are not to be plated. Following metal deposition, the remaining resist composition is stripped, such as by using a commercially available N-methylpyrrolidone (\u201cNMP\u201d) based stripper at a temperature of about 40\u00b0 to 69\u00b0 C. Suitable strippers are available from a variety of sources, such as Shipley-SVC, Sunnyvale, Calif.",
