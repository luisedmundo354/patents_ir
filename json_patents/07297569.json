        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "This invention relates to semiconductor devices that have reduced active region defects and to semiconductor devices that have unique contacting schemes.",
        "2. Discussion of the Related Art",
        "Optical communication systems use near infrared (IR) radiation at wavelengths ranging from about 800 nm to 1600 nm. In particular, important communication bands are around 850 nm for short-range fiber optic communication links and around 1310 nm and 1550 nm for longer-range fiber optic communication links.",
        "Group III-V compound semiconductor photo-detectors (PDs) are currently the photodetectors of choice for optical communications receivers because GaAs-based and InP-based materials are good near IR absorbers. These detectors have absorption lengths (Labs) of about 1 \u03bcm or less over the wavelength band of 800 nm to 1600 nm.",
        "Notwithstanding some of the desirable characteristics of Group III-V detectors, it would be advantageous to fabricate PDs in Si-based systems for two reasons: cost and functionality. Whereas Group III-V-based processing is low yield and expensive, Si-based processing is ubiquitous and low cost. Due to its high device yield, Si is the material of choice to realize complex electronic functionality. Low cost opto-electronic subsystems are possible in Si.",
        "Unfortunately Si is a poor absorber in the IR range of practical interest (e.g., 1100-1600 nm). Si IR detectors for communications can be used only near 850 nm, but even there the absorption length (Labs) of Si is relatively large, greater than 20 \u03bcm. Absorption length impacts two important PD properties: quantum yield and frequency response. Quantum yield (QY) is the fraction of incident optical power absorbed by the detector. As light passes through a material of thickness T with a given Labs, the amount of light absorbed is exp(\u2212T/Labs). In order to achieve high QY it is desirable that the thickness of the PD absorption region be greater than or equal to Labs at the wavelength of operation of the particular system.",
        "Frequency response is quantified by the 3 dB frequency (f3). QY and f3 determine the maximum data rate at which the PD can accurately detect. A QY of at least 50% is desirable, and f3 must be larger than half the data rate. Important data rates for commercial IR communication channels are 2.5 GHz, 10 GHz and 40 GHz. Therefore, a minimum of f3=2.5 GHz is required for these relatively high-speed systems. On the other hand, lower speed detectors are useful in some less demanding applications such as IR cameras and wireless IR systems.",
        "One prior art method employed to address the poor IR properties of Si is to monolithically integrate it with materials that have higher IR absorption. The material of choice for such integration is Si1-xGex, an alloy of Si and Ge having a Ge concentration (molar fraction) of x in Si. Significantly, Si1-xGex processing is compatible with Si processing.",
        "FIG. 1a compares the absorption length of pure Ge (Si1-xGex with x=1) with that of Si and InGaAsP, a standard Group III-V compound semiconductors used in PDs. Labs in Ge is below 2 \u03bcm for the entire wavelength range of interest (e.g., 1300-1600 nm). When the Ge concentration of Si1-xGex is such that 0<x<1, the absorption is intermediate between that of Si and Ge. To reach the longer wavelengths from 1310 nm to 1550 nm, nearly pure Ge with x nearly equal to 1 is ideal (e.g., x\u02dc0.8-0.9). However, the thickness of a high quality (low defect density) single crystal Si1-xGex layer that can be grown on a single crystal Si substrate or on a Si epitaxial layer is limited by the 4% lattice constant mismatch between Si and Ge. (See FIG. 1b where the curve represents critical layer thickness as a function of Ge concentration.). A Si1-xGex layer having a larger concentration of Ge has a smaller critical thickness. Layers grown above the critical thickness tend to contain misfit dislocations under equilibrium growth conditions; those grown below do not have misfit dislocations. These defects are a source of extrinsic leakage current (dark current) that adds to the noise of the detector, thereby limiting its overall sensitivity.",
        "Dark current is the current that flows in the detector in the absence of a light signal. In the presence of defects it is proportional to the defect density. Defects also form recombination centers that diminish QY. In the absence of defects, the intrinsic dark current is proportional to exp[\u2212EG(x)/kT], where EG(x) is the bandgap of the absorbing layer, x is the mole fraction of Ge in Si1-xGex, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the lattice temperature. EG(x) is a monotonically decreasing function of x, and so larger values of x result in larger intrinsic dark currents. For some applications at shorter wavelengths near 850 nm, a Si1-xGex semiconductor having x<1 may be desirable since Labs is short enough and the intrinsic dark current would be lower. Applications at longer wavelengths require a value of x nearly equal to 1 (nearly pure Ge; e.g., x\u02dc0.8-0.9)). However, for any of the IR communication wavelengths of interest, the critical thickness of any Si1-xGex semiconductor with enough Ge to be a good near IR absorber is much smaller than the absorption length in these materials. As a result, near IR Si1-xGex PDs with sufficient performance cannot be made using prior art techniques to directly grow Si1-xGex on Si.",
        "Several approaches have been proposed in the prior art in attempts to circumvent the critical layer thickness problem, but they all use complicated growth schemes. For example, Ge PDs formed on Si have been reported in the literature using two approaches different approaches known as (1) the graded buffer (GB) method, and (2) the Si/Ge heterojunction (SGH) method.",
        "Graded buffer (GB) method: As shown in FIG. 2a, the GB method involves growing and annealing a graded, multi-layered buffer region of Si1-xGex on a single crystal Si substrate. [See, for example, M. T. Currie et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 72, No. 14, p. 1718 (1998), which is incorporated herein by reference.]. The concentration of Ge in the buffer region (layers 2-4) is varied monotonically from 0% at the interface with the Si substrate 1 to 100% in the Ge device active (absorbing) layer 6. Since the buffer layers 2-4 contain lower Ge concentration than the top Ge absorbing layer, almost all the light will be absorbed in the Ge layer 6. However, the total layer structure is difficult to integrate with conventional CMOS processing because the layer stack can become quite thick and the annealing steps involved require high temperatures. Also, the best results to date for the quality of the surface layer still incorporate a relatively large density (\u02dc105 cm\u22122) of defects 7, which are schematically shown on only the right hand side of the structure for convenience only. In fact, the defects exist through out the graded region.",
        "Si/Ge heterojunction (SGH) method: As shown in FIG. 2b, the SGH method involves direct growth of a pure Ge layer 9 on a single crystal Si substrate 8 followed by a complicated sequence of high temperature, cyclic annealing steps aimed at reducing the dislocation (defect) density in the Ge layer [See, for example, G. Masini et al. Electronics Letters, Vol. 35, No. 17, p. 1467 (1999) and H-C Luan, et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 75, No. 19, p. 2909 (1999), both of which are incorporated herein by reference.]. Like the GB process, this process poses challenges to CMOS integration due to required high temperature (900 C) anneals [See, L. Colace et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 76, No 10, p. 1231 (2000), which is incorporated herein by reference.] However, the best material obtained by this technique still has a relatively high defect density of 2\u00d7106 cm\u22122.",
        "Low-defect density (sometimes referred to as defect-free) material for device fabrication is important for reducing noise and increasing sensitivity in PDs. However, prior art techniques are not capable of producing low-defect-density Ge on Si. In addition, any defects are located in highly doped regions, such as the electrical contact regions, which are not depleted by the electric field. Heavy doping in the defect regions ensures that these regions remain electrically neutral under all bias conditions. Otherwise, generation-recombination current results in large reverse leakage (dark) current.",
        "The region near the interface region 10 in FIG. 2b and the graded buffer regions 2-4 in FIG. 2a contain the most defects, as pointed out by G. Masini et al, IEEE Trans on Elec. Dev., Vol. 48, No. 6, p. 1092 (2001), which is incorporated herein by reference. It is essential that these regions be highly doped; however, it is not possible to eliminate all of the defect-induced dark current by means of high doping because some region of low-doped Ge is required to absorb the incident light signal. Low doping in the absorbing region ensures that carrier transport is dominated by the fast drift mechanism rather than the slower diffusion process.",
        "Both the GB and SGH methods have been used to form two common types of PDs: a vertical PIN PD (FIG. 3a) and a metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) PD (FIG. 3b). Both PDs have been designed for use as surface-illuminated detectors in which the signal light impinges upon the top (or bottom) surface of the detector and essentially perpendicular to the primary layers of the device. However, it is possible to use these PDs as edge-illuminated devices in which signal light impinges on an edge of the device and propagates in a direction essentially parallel to the primary layers of the device.",
        "The major conclusions described here pertain to both vertical PIN and MSM IR prior art detectors. These devices suffer from two important limitations: (1) process incompatibility with conventional CMOS processes, and (2) intrinsically poorer performance. In addition, it has not previously been appreciated that these limitations are inherent in the methods of the prior art.",
        "Thus, a need remains in the art for a Si-based near IR PD that exhibits both high speed and high QY.",
        "To clarify the limitations of the prior art the implementation schemes of both PIN and MSM devices have been analyzed. In the vertical PIN structure shown in FIG. 3a the substrate layer 14 is either a single crystal Si substrate or a Si1-xGex buffer on such Si substrate. It is non-absorbing in the 1200-1600 nm band. The active device layer 12, where signal light absorption is intended, is undoped Ge. The top, highly doped contact layer 11 is also Ge. In the prior art GB method, the bottom, highly doped contact layer 13 is also Ge but in the prior art SGH method, it is Si. Signal light 19 is incident on the top surface 18. The light penetrates the device layers and is absorbed in the Ge active layer 12. Electron-hole pairs are created in Ge layers 11-13 of the GB method and in layers 11 and 12 of SGH method where they are separated by the electric field. The latter is generated by connecting a voltage source (not shown) with the indicated polarity across metal contacts 15 and 16. The detector photocurrent flows through a detection circuit (not shown) connected to contacts 15 and 16.",
        "In both of these devices the thickness (T12) of the absorption layer 12 is approximately greater than 1 \u03bcm, which is the absorption length for light between 1310 nm and 1550 nm, and QY is given by exp(\u2212T12/Labs). In a well-designed device, the frequency response is limited by the transit time of the photo-generated electrons and holes. Two different times are important in the vertical PIN structure: the drift time (\u03c4d) in the high field (undoped active region 12) and the diffusion time (\u03c4diff) of carriers generated in the low field (high doped contact regions 11 and 13). Because carriers are generated throughout the Ge layers, there is a distribution of transit times. Calculation of the exact frequency response is complicated, but readily done through simulation. However, a good feel for f3 can be obtained by looking at the longest transit times, which limit the frequency response. The longest drift time is \u02dcT12/vd where vd is the average drift velocity of carriers in the electric field of layer 12. The longest diffusion time is proportional to the square of the thickness (W) of the doped layer contact layer 11. The overall transit time (\u03c4) is approximately given by \u03c4d+\u03c4diff, and f3 is then approximately 1/(2\u03c0\u03c4). Even for W on the order of 0.2 \u03bcm, the diffusion time can dominate the overall frequency response.",
        "The MSM structure shown in FIG. 3b differs from the PIN structure in that the electric drift field is parallel to the top surface 28, whereas in the PIN structure of FIG. 3a it is perpendicular to the surface 18. Again the substrate 24 is a single crystal Si substrate in the SGH method and a graded buffer layer in the GB method. The absorption of signal light takes place in the Ge active layer 23. In this case, inter-digitated Schottky barrier electrodes 21 and 22 are disposed directly on the Ge top surface 28 from which the detector photocurrent flows. In this device the normally incident light penetrates the Ge layer 23 and is absorbed there creating electron-hole pairs. As in the vertical PIN structure, QY is determined by the Ge layer thickness T23. The relevant transit time in the MSM structure is given approximately by \u03c4d\u02dc(T23+D)/vd where D is the spacing between adjacent electrodes. Unlike the PIN structure, the MSM device has no problem with carrier diffusion times because there are no highly doped, low field regions where carriers can be photo-generated.",
        "The PIN structure is preferable to the MSM structure because the highly defective interfacial region 25 is not highly doped, and therefore the MSM has relatively large dark currents. For the same reason, in the PIN structure it is preferable to make the bottom contact layer 13 of Ge, as in the devices described using the GB method, in order to ensure that the defect interface 17 is highly doped. Although the prior art SGH method does not suggest forming the Si/Ge heterojunction between the bottom contact layer 13 and the substrate 14, there is no reason why this couldn't be done in principle. The resulting structure would then be electrically identical to the PIN formed using the GB method and would consequently have the same performance. Therefore, for comparison purposes in the following discussion, we need consider the limitations of only the best of these prior art devices: the PIN structure (FIG. 3a) formed using either the GB or SGH method in which the bottom contact layer 13 is Ge.",
        "We have performed device simulations to assess the ideal device speed of the PIN structures discussed above and have found that the frequency response of these devices is inherently limited by transit time considerations. The results are reported in Table I, below.",

        "Simulations were performed on idealized PIN structures as illustrated in FIG. 3a with voltages on contacts 15 and 16 that were large enough to result in saturated drift velocities in active region 12. The first set of results includes photo-generation in all Ge regions, which is what would occur naturally. In these simulations W has been fixed at 0.2 \u03bcm (a typical value for good contacting), and the high field region thickness T12 has been varied. To make the detector fast, T12 must be decreased, but it is clear from the table that as the ratio of W to T12 increases, f3 decreases. This relationship between T12 and f3 occurs because more of the carriers in the photocurrent response are limited by \u03c4diff than by \u03c4d The second set of simulations varies W but fixes T12 at 1 \u03bcm, a value required to give a reasonable QY. Again, as the ratio of W to T12 increases, f3 decreases, this time with an approximate 1/W2 dependence, which is expected from diffusion-limited carrier transit. The third set of simulations artificially removes photo-generation in the contact regions 11 and 13 to demonstrate the impact of absorption in these n-type and p-type contact layers. In this case, f3 is limited by carrier transit times in the active region 12 and increases linearly with 1/T12 as expected. It should be noted that in this structure it is not possible to reduce W indefinitely. W is required to be thick enough for good, low leakage contacting and to be thick enough to ensure that all of the defects that exist at the interface 17 between the Ge and Si are completely covered by high doping. If this interfacial region is depleted of free carriers, prohibitively large dark currents will flow adversely impacting the noise performance. Poor frequency response is the inherent problem in such prior art devices. If dark currents are controlled, highly doped contact regions must be formed in the Ge. But, this design results in a frequency response limited by the diffusion time \u03c4diff. Consequently, in the prior art devices it is very difficult to achieve high enough f3 to satisfy the desired data rates of high-speed systems.",

        "Fabrication Process",
        "Before discussing in detail various device designs that can be realized using novel processes in accordance with one aspect of our invention, we first discuss the process as a general approach to fabricating relatively defect-free semiconductor active regions of devices such as PDs and MOSFETs. However, we concentrate in the exposition on the fabrication of low-defect-density absorption regions of SiGe PDs for operation at IR wavelengths of about 800-1600 nm for the purposes of illustration and as a reflection of one of the principal applications of our invention.",
        "From our preceding discussion of prior art PDs, it is clear that we desire a device in which optical absorption occurs in high quality Ge, the majority of which is undoped or is depleted.",
        "Our invention uses an epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) technique to form high quality Ge embedded in an insulator structure that has been formed on top of a Si substrate. ELO has been used to monolithically integrate materials with dissimilar lattice constants such as GaN on Si [See, for example, O. Nam et al Appl. Phys. Lett, Vol. 71, No. 18, p. 2638 (1997) and S. Nakamura et al, Jap. J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 36, No. 12A, Part 2, p. L1568 (1997), both of which are incorporated herein by reference.] and Ge over Si. The process of ELO for Ge over Si is detailed in FIGS. 4a-4c. Here, a thin insulator (e.g., oxide) layer 42 is formed on top of a single crystal Si substrate 41. Seed windows 43 are defined in the oxide lithographically and opened by etching down to the Si. The exposed Si surface is cleaned for Ge growth. Then, selective CVD growth takes place with Ge 43 growing only on the exposed Si (FIG. 4b). The growth continues until the Ge overgrows the seed window, and the growth fronts 47 from neighboring seed windows coalesce to form a continuous film (FIG. 4c). Large defect densities are found in only two parts of the resulting Ge film: as shown in FIG. 4c defects 46 thread from the Si interface at the bottom of the seed window up to the top of the film over the seed window, and defects 45 form at the region where two growth fronts meet. The majority of the Ge layer over the oxide mask is essentially defect free, as shown at 48 of FIG. 4c.",
        "This process was improved by setting the aspect ratio (height/width) of the seed window to more than 1:1 as shown in FIG. 4d [See, T. Langdo et al, Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 76, No. 25, p. 3700 (2000), which is incorporated herein by reference.]. In this case no threading misfit dislocations or stacking faults emerged above the seed windows and into the film above them; instead the defects 46 were confined to the region of the seed windows below the top of the oxide layer 42. However, large defect densities were still found in the regions 45 (FIG. 4d) where the growth fronts from different seed windows met. It should be noted that if the distance between seed windows is increased, then a larger fraction of the Ge film area would be defect free. However, this would mean very long growth times and thick films (film thickness grows as the lateral overgrowth distance increases). Thick films also result in long transit times.",
        "One aspect of our invention uses modified ELO to form high quality high Ge content Si1-xGex regions to serve as PD elements in which defect-induced dark currents are suppressed and carrier transit times are limited through the reduction of carrier absorption in highly doped regions. More specifically, this aspect of our invention is a method for forming high-Ge-content Si1-xGex regions (hereinafter referred to as pixels) within an insulating cladding region disposed on a Si substrate such that the volume of possible defective Si1-xGex is minimized and such that the Si1-xGex pixels are essentially defect free. In particular, our invention uses ELO of Si1-xGex to form the pixels above the top of insulator layer 42 in FIG. 4d so that essentially all defects are confined to regions of the seed window below the top of insulator layer 42.",
        "Contrary to the situation in the prior art, in our method no defects are formed at the intersection of the growth fronts. The growth fronts on the overgrown cladding region are confined by the cladding (e.g., silicon dioxide) sidewalls, and, therefore, do not coalesce to form heavily defective regions. This important result is achieved by combining high-Ge-content Si1-xGex ELO with damascene planarization (ELO-D). In general, Damascene involves the steps of forming a window in an insulating layer on a wafer, filling the window with a material that is different from the wafer (e.g., a semiconductor or a metal) and that overlaps the top surface of the insulating layer, and then planarizing (e.g., chemical-mechanical polishing) the overlapping portions so that the material in the window is essentially flush with the top surface of the insulating layer.",
        "In our process high-Ge content Si1-xGex means Si1-xGex with a Ge concentration or mole fraction x that is preferably greater than about 0.8-0.9 for most applications of PDs at IR operating wavelengths of about 800-1600 nm. In some applications, however, x may be as low as 0.5, but Si1-xGex having a Ge content less than about 50% does not offer sufficient optical absorption in the wavelengths of interest. On the other hand, in other non-optical devices it may be acceptable to have x as low as 0.1.",
        "One set of processes steps utilized to achieve this goal for a surface-illuminated PD will now be explained in conjunction with FIGS. 5a-5g.",
        "First, an insulating cladding region 52 is formed on the top surface of a Si substrate 51, as shown in FIG. 5a. Illustratively cladding region 52 comprises a multiplicity of insulator layers (hereinafter referred to as cladding layers) formed on the substrate. First a stem cladding layer 52.1 [e.g., 1 \u03bcm of a silicon dioxide] is deposited on the top major surface of the substrate 51. Next, an etch stop layer 52.2 (e.g., 40 nm of silicon nitride) is deposited on cladding layer 52. Finally, a pixel cladding layer 52.3 (e.g., 1 \u03bcm of silicon dioxide) is deposited on the etch stop layer. Cladding layers 52.1 and 52.3 may each comprise a multiplicity of layers or they may be single layers; they may have different thicknesses; and they may have different compositions from one another. The cladding layers may alternatively comprise other dielectric materials such as silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride.",
        "In one embodiment, the etch stop layer 52.2 and the pixel cladding layer 52.3 have different compositions, and the etch rate of etch stop layer 52.2 should be smaller than that of pixel cladding layer 52.3. In an alternative embodiment, even if the etch rate of layer 52.2 is not substantially different from that of layer 52.3, well known optical metrology techniques can be used to discern the extent of the etching process and to stop etching at the appropriate time based on the difference in chemical composition of the etched layers.",
        "Next (FIG. 5b), Si1-xGex active region (pixel) wells 53 are defined lithographically on pixel cladding layer 52.3, and a standard etch chemistry (e.g., a mixture of CHF3, C2F6, CO and Ar) is used to selectively etch the material of pixel cladding layer 52.3. Etching essentially stops at the material of the etch-stop layer 52.2. Next, we switch to a different chemistry (e.g., hot phosphoric acid for 60 sec) to etch the etch-stop layer 52.2, ending on stem cladding layer 52.1.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 5c, we then deposit a conformal dielectric layer 54 (e.g., 200 nm of plasma TEOS oxide) over the structure to cover the pixel cladding layer 52.3, etch stop layer",
        "52.2, and the exposed surface of the stem cladding layer 52.1. The conformal dielectric layer 54 should be able to resist nucleation of Si1-xGex material on its surface during the subsequent selective epitaxial growth (SEG) procedure.",

        "The conformal dielectric layer 54 and stem cladding layer 52.1 are then etched selectively down to the Si substrate 51, also as shown in FIG. 5d-1. This second lithography and etch step forms the seed windows 55 for ELO growth. Using ELO, the seed window and active region wells are filled with epitaxial Si1-xGex.",
        "The shape of the pixels (in top view, as shown in FIG. 6a) is preferably symmetric (e.g., square, rectangular or circular;) since the overgrowth process (discussed below) proceeds uniformly outward from the seed window. Similar shapes may be used for the stem region. However, since it is difficult to tile a surface with circles, the use of a circular cross-section for the pixels, and hence the stem regions, is not preferred.",
        "Due to the inherent facet formation during growth, the structure must be overgrown by some amount to ensure complete filling of the well region. (When the active region windows have square cross-sections, the overgrowth tends to have a pyramidal shape, as shown at 56 of FIG. 5d). The degree of the faceting of the epitaxial layer is strongly determined by the growth conditions that are in turn strongly influenced by the dielectric material surface exposed during SEG. In this case the exposed dielectrics are conformal dielectric layer 54 and stem cladding layer 52.1. If the dielectric material of layer 54 is superior (in terms of rejecting nucleation of Si1-xGex during SEG) to other dielectrics used in the cladding structure 52, further optimization of the growth process can be accomplished by using an additional deposition of a conformal dielectric layer material followed by an anisotropic etch after formation of the seed windows, leaving a conformal dielectric layer 54.1 on the sidewalls of the stem window but not on the bottom thereof, as shown in FIG. 5d-2. After the anisotropic etch, the exposed dielectric would be only layer 54/54.1 material, and the growth conditions could be optimized independent of the original materials of cladding layer 52. This embodiment of our invention is important since in a given CMOS process, the materials used for the interlevel dielectrics (ILDs) may allow Si1-xGex to nucleate on the ILD during the epitaxial growth step.",
        "Since the misfit dislocations arising from strained Si1-xGex growth on Si are primarily of the 60-degree type, it is desirable that the aspect ratio of the seed window be larger than about 1.7 (in both cross-sections perpendicular to the plane of the layers) to limit defect penetration above the top of stem cladding layer 52. Since the Ge mole fraction x is at or near 1 (e.g., x\u02dc0.8-0.9) for the PD pixel, this aspect ratio is especially important to attaining defect-free material in the detector well. Other aspect ratios would apply to other materials systems (e.g., GaN grown on Si) and can readily be determined by those skilled in the art.",
        "FIG. 5e displays the structure after damascene planarization of the overgrown material 56, as shown in FIG. 5d, using a technique such as chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP). One result is that the top of the active region 56.1 is essentially flush with the top of cladding region 52, which in this embodiment includes conformal layer 54. In this regard, the composition of layer 54 should make a good CMP stop for Si1-xGex polishing.",
        "At this point we define several volume parameters: the volume of an active region or pixel 56.1 is the volume of the epitaxial material that is grown in the first opening (after the conformal dielectric is deposited), and the volume of a stem region is the volume of the epitaxial material that is grown in the second opening with no conformal dielectric deposited therein (FIG. 5d-1) or with a conformal dielectric so deposited (FIG. 5d-2), depending on the design chosen or fabrication process used.",
        "The process continues with a sequence of conventional steps that converts the basic structure of FIG. 5e into an array of pixel regions 56.1 that function as surface-illuminated PDs, as shown in FIG. 5f. For example, an implant screen oxide layer 57 (e.g., 80 nm of plasma TEOS) is deposited over the entire structure, and ion implantation is used to form the opposite-conductivity-type (p-type and n-type) contacting regions 59. For example, each of the implants could involve a sequence of three separate implants at the following energies/doses: for n-type regions\u2014P at 60 KeV/1\u00d71015 cm\u22122, 170 KeV/2\u00d71015 cm\u22122, and 320 KeV/4\u00d71014 cm\u22122; and for p-type regions\u2014B at 20 KeV/1\u00d71015 cm\u22122, 60 KeV/2\u00d71015 cm\u22122, and 140 KeV/4\u00d71015 cm\u22122. A furnace anneal (e.g., at 400\u00b0 C. for 30) minutes or a rapid thermal anneal (e.g., at 600-650\u00b0 C. for 20-30 sec) removes implant damage to the crystalline lattice and simultaneously activates the implanted dopants. The active region itself is preferably i-type; that is undoped or unintentionally doped. (Unintentionally doped means that any doping present in the active region is a very low levels and occurs primarily from background contamination in the epitaxial growth chamber use to form that region.)",
        "Lastly, an interlevel dielectric (ILD) layer 58 is deposited over the structure, contact windows are pattered and etched using an etch chemistry that does not selectively etch germanium (e.g. a mixture of CH4, CH3 and Argon), contact metal is deposited and a patterned hard dielectric 59.3 is used to shape electrodes 59.2 (e.g., Ti/TiN/Al) on the top surface and plugs 59.1 (e.g., Al) that connect the electrodes to the p-type and n-type regions 59.",
        "Although the foregoing process describes the fabrication of surface-illuminated PDs, the basic process steps that result in a structure of the type shown in FIG. 5e or 5g can also be utilized to fabricate other devices such as semiconductor waveguides (WGs) that deliver signal light to edge-illuminated PDs. More specifically, a WG can be formed in the same fashion as the active region or pixel 56.1 of FIG. 5e, but the WG and the active region would be juxtaposed as shown in FIGS. 6b and 7b so that signal light coupled into, for example, a cleaved end 89 (FIG. 6b) of the WG; e.g., from optical fiber 86, FIG. 6b is delivered to an adjacent pixel (e.g., 81, FIG. 6b).",
        "The fabrication process should take care that the WG is aligned with the pixel both laterally and vertically in order to feed signal light into the active region of the pixel; little or none of the optical signal should be fed into the stem region of the PD.",
        "In addition, the WG material should have a lower Ge content than the pixel so that the pixel will absorb light in the required wavelength band but that the WG will not.",
        "Because the WG structure is elongated along its axis of light propagation, it is not possible to make the aspect ratio of the WG seed window (in the cross-section taken along that and perpendicular to the plane of the layers) larger than the 1.7 factor required to suppress defect formation for large Ge content. Fortunately, defects in the WG are not as important as defects in the pixel, since the WG is not electrically active. However, defects in the WG do lead to optical losses through scattering. Therefore, in devices that require low-loss waveguides, the Ge content in the WG should be limited to ensure low defect density. Typically, 20% Ge content is low enough to limit significant defect formation.",
        "In a similar fashion, the basic process steps that result in a structure of the type shown in FIG. 5e or 5g can also be utilized to fabricate a SiGe on Si or GaN on Si MOSFET of the type shown in FIG. 6c. In this case, the active region 56.1 (FIG. 5e) would serve as the site for formation of the source, drain and gate regions of the transistor using standard process steps well-known to those skilled in the art.",
        "Basic Device Structure",
        "Illustratively, semiconductor devices in accordance with various embodiments of our invention may be designed to function as a number of different devices; e.g., surface-illuminated PD (e.g., FIGS. 5f and 6a), an edge-illuminated PD with an integrated WG (e.g., FIG. 6b), or a MOSFET (e.g., FIG. 6c).",
        "In accordance with one aspect of our invention, the basic structure of such a semiconductor device includes a single crystal substrate 251 comprising a first material (e.g., Si) and an insulative cladding region 252 comprising a dielectric material (e.g., SiO2). Embedded in the cladding region is a pair of single crystal regions: stem region 255 and active region 256 (e.g., the absorption region of a PD; the source, drain and channel regions of a MOSFET) each comprising a second, different semiconductor material (e.g., GaN or Si1-xGex, 0<x\u22661; hereinafter referred to as SiGe for simplicity). Stem region 255 connects the substrate to the active region, which is essentially flush with the top surface 253. Importantly, the stem region is designed so that defects are confined thereto; that is, active region 256 is essentially defect-free. Stated another way, active region 257 has an extremely low density of defects (i.e., less than about 103 cm\u22123) so that any defects that might be present have an insignificant effect on device performance. To this end, the aspect ratios of the stem region (i.e., the ratio of its depth to both of its width dimensions in the case of a square or rectangular cross-section in a plane parallel to the layers) is designed to provide the desired confinement of defects. For example, where the substrate is Si and the pixel and stem regions are SiGe, the aspect ratios of the stem region should be larger than about 1.7.",
        "In theory the cladding region 52 may be a single layer, but in practice it is preferably multi-layered including, for example, a stop etch layer 52.2 disposed between a lower dielectric layer 52.1 and an upper dielectric layer 52.3. The latter are typically oxides but need not be the same material nor need they have the same thickness. In the case where the substrate 51 is Si and the pixel is SiGe, the stop etch layer 52.2 is illustratively Si3N4 and the upper and lower dielectric layers 52.1 and 52.3 are illustratively silicon dioxide. These cladding region materials may also be used to fabricate devices in which the substrate is Si and the pixel and stem regions are GaN.",
        "Surface-Illuminated Photodetectors (PDs)",
        "This basic device structure is designed, as shown in the top view of FIG. 6a, to function as a surface-illuminated PIN PD or as an array 60 of such PDs. Each PD includes a single crystal stem region 55 (FIG. 5f), which comprises a first material and is designed to confine defects thereto. Stem region 55 epitaxially connects the single crystal substrate 51, which comprises a different material, to the pixel 56.1. As described in the preceding fabrication section, the stem region serves to allow nucleation at the exposed substrate surface during epitaxial growth of regions 55 and 56.1. Each PD also includes an essentially defect-free i-type, single crystal active region (or pixel) 56.1 of the same material in which signal light is absorbed. As depicted in FIG. 5f, the top of each pixel 56.1 is essentially flush with the top of the dielectric cladding region 52, which in this embodiment includes conformal dielectric layer 54.",
        "The PIN design is completed by opposite-conductivity-type (one p-type; the other n-type) contact regions 59 formed in the pixel 56.1. An interlevel dielectric (ILD) region 58 is disposed over the top surface of the cladding region and pixels. Electrical contact is made to the contact regions 59 by means of conductive (e.g., metallic) plugs 59.1 that extend from electrodes 59.2, 59.3 through the ILD 58. This PD design, when fabricated using low-defect-density Si1-xGex pixels with x\u02dc0.8-0.9 on a Si substrate, is particularly well-suited to relatively high speed (e.g., \u22672.5 Gb/s) communications applications at operating wavelengths in the 800-1600 nm range. However, our invention is not limited to applications in which the Ge content is this high. In fact, our invention may be advantageous with active regions or pixels having considerably less Ge: e.g., x\u22670.1, depending on the wavelength of operation (in the case of PDs) or on the device function (in the case of MOSFETs or other electronic devices). For example, our low-defect-density pixels would be useful in PD applications such as those involving an IR or visible wavelength camera or IR wireless local area networks (WLAN), which would benefit from a higher optical absorption of our pixels than is available using prior art Si pixels.",
        "In surface-illuminated PDs, the formation of dielectric mirrors at either the top or bottom surfaces (or both) of each pixel 56.1 (FIG. 5f) enhances performance.",
        "A mirror at the bottom of each pixel increases the QY of the device by reflecting back into the pixels any un-absorbed light that reaches the bottom of the pixels. The bottom mirror increases the apparent optical path length without requiring a thicker pixel. In one embodiment, the portions of the cladding region 52 (FIG. 5f), 252 (FIG. 5g) adjacent the stem region comprise an alternating set of layers that have different indices of refraction. The mirror layer thicknesses are chosen to produce the desired reflectance (at the operating wavelength) between the bottom of the pixel and the cladding region 52.1 (FIG. 5f), 252 (FIG. 5g).",
        "In an alternative embodiment, a dielectric mirror 259 (FIG. 5g) is also formed on the top surface of each pixel 56.1 (FIG. 5f), 256 (FIG. 5g). A resonant cavity is formed within the pixel by designing the dielectric mirrors to have the proper reflectance on both the top surface and the bottom surface of the pixel.",
        "To reduce reflections from the pixel-ILD interface, an anti-reflection (AR) coating may be inserted between the pixel 56.1 and the ILD 58. Those skilled in the art are familiar with various techniques for forming such AR coatings.",
        "In accordance with another aspect of our invention, FIG. 7a shows a plan-view of the two relevant lithography levels used to generate pixels in a surface-illuminated PD. The pixels, which illustratively have the three dimensional shape of cylinders, are depicted as having square cross-sections, but, of course, it would be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that other geometric cross-sections could be utilized; e.g., rectangles or circles, as previously discussed. Moreover, an array of four pixels is shown for purposes of illustration only. It is understood by those skilled in the art that a surface illuminated PD would typically be tiled by a larger set of pixels; on the other hand, it is also possible that the entire area could comprise one large pixel. The latter design, however, would require very long growth times for typical optical spot sizes (e.g., 15 \u03bcm by 15 \u03bcm). The top surface area of the pixel is defined by the pixel mask 92 and the corresponding area of the stem region is defined by the pixel stem mask 91. The area of the stem mask should lie entirely inside of the area of the pixel mask. The area between the pixels comprises an exposed portion of cladding region 93 (also shown as the conformal dielectric layer 54 in FIG. 5f).",
        "In addition, the ratio of the area outside the pixel, which corresponds to the exposed area of cladding region 93, to the area of the pixels themselves 92 should be minimized to ensure that the maximum amount of signal light is captured in a surface-illuminated device. Ideally, the area of the stem region is much smaller than the area of the pixels, and the area between the pixels is small compared to the area of the pixels themselves. This design ensures that more of the light is incident upon the pixels (hence higher QY) and that little light can find its way into the stems where there are defects and from which the transit times for escape are long. As noted earlier, it is desirable that the height of the stem region be larger than or equal to width of either side of the stem region (preferably >1.7 times larger for SiGe stem regions grown on a Si substrate) in order to limit the formation of defects to the stem region and to keep them from penetrating into the pixel. In one embodiment, the height of the stem is given by the thickness of the deposited stem cladding layer 52.1 plus the thickness of conformal dielectric layer 54 of FIG. 5f.",
        "Edge-Illuminated PDs",
        "In accordance with another embodiment of our invention, the PDs are edge-illuminated rather than surface-illuminated. In this case, as shown in FIG. 6b, signal light to be detected is delivered to a pixel 81 by means of a semiconductor waveguide 83. The pixel 81 and the waveguide 83 have stem regions 82 and 84, respectively, which are fabricated using similar procedures but different masks. In addition, whereas the cross-section of the pixel stem region 82 is depicted as being square, that of the waveguide is shown as being rectangular, again for the purposes of illustration only (although the elongated shape of waveguide 83, terminated at its exterior end by, for example, a cleaved surface 89, does lead to a design in which the waveguide and its stem region are both rectangular).",
        "Typically, the pixel and waveguide are incorporated in a subsystem 80 that includes a semiconductor laser 88 (e.g., an InP/InGaAsP laser) for generating an output signal 88.1 at a center frequency in the range of about 800-1600 nm. In communications applications, the latter is modulated either directly (by an external modulator, not shown) or indirectly (by modulating the drive current applied to the laser using circuitry, not shown). The signal light is coupled into an optical fiber 86 be means of a suitable first lens system 87 (or the laser 88 and fiber 86 may be butt-coupled to one another), and output of the fiber is coupled into the waveguide 83 (preferably not into the stem region) by means of a suitable second lens system 85 (or the fiber 86 and the waveguide 83 may be butt-coupled to one another). The waveguide 83 delivers the modulated signal light 88.2 to the pixel 81 (preferably not to the stem region 82). Signal light absorbed in the pixel is converted to a photocurrent, which flows to detection circuitry (not shown).",
        "In accordance with another aspect of our invention, FIG. 7b shows a plan-view of the relevant lithography levels used to generate a pixel and WG in an edge-illuminated PD. The direction of light propagation in this structure is designated by arrow 106. The pixels are formed with a pixel mask 102 and a stem region mask 101, similar to the approach used to fabricate the surface-illuminated PD of FIG. 7a. The WGs are formed in the same cladding region 103 as the pixels.",
        "The length of the gap space 108 between the edge 102.1 of the pixel mask 102 and the edge 104.1 of the WG mask 104 is preferably optimized to reduce scattering losses from the discontinuity in refractive index imposed by the cladding region 103 in the gap between the pixel and the WG. The maximum amount of light is passed from the WG into the pixel if the length of the gap space is equal to an even multiple of half wavelengths as measured in the material of the cladding region. In this design the gap constitutes a resonant cavity.",
        "Furthermore, the speed of the edge detector of FIG. 7b is increased by injecting the signal light from the WG into only a middle portion of the pixel. To this end the width Wwg of the WG should be made less than the width Wp of the pixel, and the center of the WG should be aligned with the center of the pixel (and, hence, above its stem region). In this case, photogeneration of carriers primarily occurs in the middle of the pixel, and, therefore, the maximum carrier transit time to the edges is reduced compared to the case in which the pixel is uniformly illuminated. This design of the WG and pixel sections also increases QY since the pixel is able to capture more of the light that diffracts from the end of the WG aperture.",
        "MOSFETs",
        "In accordance with another embodiment of our invention, as shown in FIG. 6c, a MOSFET comprises a single crystal substrate 71, a stem region 75 formed on the substrate so as confine defects to the stem region, a relatively defect-free active region 76 formed on the stem region. The stem and active regions are embedded in a dielectric cladding region 72, and the top of the active region is essentially flush with the top of the cladding region. Separated source and drain regions are formed in the active region (e.g., by ion implantation) and a gate structure is formed between them. The gate structure includes a gate dielectric (e.g., a high-k dielectric such as Hf2O3 or Al2O3 grown by ALD) and a well-known gate stack (e.g., including one or more polysilicon layers). The channel (not shown) extends under the gate dielectric 74 and between the source and drain regions 73. An ILD 78 is formed over the top of the cladding and active regions, and windows are formed therein to allow source, drain and gate electrodes (75, 76, 77, respectively) to make electrical contact to the corresponding source and drain regions and gate structure.",
        "Preferably the active region 76 comprises relatively defect-free Si1-xGex on a Si substrate by the fabrication technique previously described. Since Ge, and high-Ge-content SiGe, has higher electron and hole mobility than Si, our MOSFETs can attain higher performance than prior art Si MOSFETs. However, Ge MOSFET integration must address the same issues as the integrated high-Ge-content SiGe PDs: that is, the lattice constant mismatch between Si and Ge in the prior art leads to relatively high defect densities in bulk grown Ge films, and the thick process stacks and high anneal temperatures used by the prior art to grow Ge with reasonable defect densities are incompatible with conventional Si processing. Accordingly, it is another aspect of our invention that MOSFET structures are formed in the high-Ge-content SiGe active regions by means of our ELO-D process.",
        "Our approach not only allows easy integration of high quality Ge MOSFETs into Si integrated circuits, but also enables the realization of SOI (silicon-on-insulator) Ge MOSFETs, which provide better performance than convention bulk MOSFETs though parasitic capacitance and better short channel control.",
        "It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the pixel cladding layer thickness (for a given channel doping level) determines whether these devices are either partially or fully depleted.",
        "PD Contact Configurations: Speed of Operation",
        "Another aspect of our invention relates to PD contact configurations that ensure that transit times are limited by short drift times, not by long diffusion times (\u03c4diff). These designs, which are illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9, enhance the speed of operation of the PD and hence are particularly well suited for operation in high-speed (e.g., >2.5 Gb/s) communications systems.",
        "To this end, and in accordance with another embodiment of our invention shown in FIG. 8a, we utilize an MSM type contact structure that is free from \u03c4diff limitations, but the pixels are formed using our ELO-D technique previously described. In particular, voltages of opposite polarities (V+ and V\u2212) are applied to alternating metal contacts 117 to each pixel 115. Within a given pixel, no two adjacent metal contacts have the same polarity. This design ensures that there are always high fields that accelerate the generated photocarriers so that the drift transit time is minimized. Illustratively, the contacts 117 are made of metals (e.g., Ag) that form Schottky barriers on SiGe.",
        "The device of FIG. 8a may be used as a surface-illuminated PD or edge-illuminated device. When used as a surface-illuminated PD, the contact 117.1 is positioned to fully cover the underlying stem region 116.1 in each pixel, so that signal light incident on the top surface is blocked from penetrating into the stem region. On the other hand, when used as an edge-illuminated device, it is important that the width of the stem region (as measured transverse to the direction of light propagation) be less than half the wavelength of the light in the material (e.g., SiGe) of that region so as to cutoff penetration of light therein.",
        "However, it may not be practical to use a true MSM contacting structure in combination with conventional Si-CMOS processing. Schottky barrier contacts are not part of conventional Si IC processing and could result in contamination of the CMOS devices. In addition, good low leakage contacts are difficult to form, and Schottky barrier metals typical have low melting points, which are incompatible with the temperatures typically used in standard IC metalization schemes.",
        "Therefore, another embodiment of our invention is a MSM-like contacting scheme, as shown in FIG. 8b, that doesn't suffer from the disadvantages of using Schottky contacts. This approach combines a lateral PIN contact arrangement with our ELO-D process. More specifically, a PIN photodiode is formed laterally on the surface of the detector by implantation of n+-type and p+-type contacting regions 128 and 129, respectively; the i-type pixels 125 are undoped or unintentionally doped (i.e., they have sufficiently low doping that they can be completely depleted). Preferably the pixels are SiGe and are either intrinsic or have low doping (i.e., less than about 1017 cm\u22123), and the doped contact regions have higher dopant concentrations (e.g., greater than about 1018 cm\u22123). These doped regions are then contacted by metal plugs 127 that extend through and are embedded in the ILD 131. Metal lines (i.e., electrodes) 130 contact the plugs above the ILD. The plugs, ILD and metal lines are all common elements of Si IC processing. As with the PD of FIG. 8a, in the embodiment of FIG. 8b the metal lines 130 and plugs 127.1 also block signal light incident on the top surface from penetrating into the stem region.",
        "The metal lines 130 are connected to positive (132) and negative (133) power supplies V+ and V\u2212, respectively, from a detection circuit (not shown). This design ensures that the PIN diode is reverse biased from n+-type region 128 to pixel 125 to p+-type region 129.",
        "It is another aspect of our invention that within a given pixel, no two adjacent doped contact regions have the same conductivity type or, as with the embodiment of FIG. 8a, are connected to electrical contacts having the same polarity. In addition, the doped contact regions 128 and 129 should be deep enough (as measured from the top of the cladding region) to ensure low leakage contacts from the plugs 127. Making these contact regions approximately 0.2 \u03bcm deep is sufficient in SiGe pixels.",
        "PD Contact Configurations: Dark Current",
        "FIG. 9a shows a plan-view of masking features used to realize several possible contacting arrangements for a surface-illuminated pixel array. More than one type of contacting arrangement is depicted on the same PD for purposes of illustration only. In practice, it is likely that only one of these arrangements would be used on a particular PD.",
        "A multiplicity of PD pixels tiles the photo-detecting surface (e.g., the top surface of a front-illuminated PD; the bottom surface of a back-illuminated PD). Four pixels 141a-141d are shown for purposes of illustration only. Each pixel includes doped n+-type and p+-type contacting regions 142. These doped regions are contacted by metal plugs 143, which are electrically connected to metal lines 145 overlying the ILD 148. The pixel stem regions are labeled 146. Because of the long diffusion transit times, it is important to limit the amount of signal light absorbed in the doped contacting regions 142.",
        "In accordance with one embodiment of our invention, diffusion transit times in the doped regions are reduced by means of a light-absorbing (e.g., metal) mask that blocks signal light from reaching (and being absorbed by) part or all of the doped contacting regions. In the prior art care has not been taken to block photogeneration in these highly doped contacting regions because its impact on PD speed has not been appreciated. In fact, prior art devices minimize the amount of metal coverage because it reduces the QY of the PD. However, to achieve higher speed PDs this embodiment of our invention trades a small reduction in QY for a large improvement in speed by limiting light penetration into the doped contacting regions.",
        "More specifically, this embodiment of our invention uses metal over more than about 30% of the aggregate surface area of the doped contact regions to block a significant fraction of signal light from reaching the doped regions. For example, the leftmost n+-type contacting region 142a of pixel 141a is completely occluded from light incident from above the surface, whereas the center p+-type contacting region of pixel 141a is only partly occluded.",
        "Another contacting scheme can be arranged to both ensure that there is no light absorption in the contacting regions while limiting the amount of pixel surface area covered by metal. This arrangement is shown in FIG. 9a, pixel 141d. Here, the doped n+ and p+ contacting regions 142a are arranged in the corners of the pixel. Metal covers the doped contacting regions, but since the contacting regions are in the corners instead of extending from one side of the pixel to the other (in contrast to the other pixels of FIG. 9a) they allow a larger fraction of the surface area of the pixel to absorb light. When using an arrangement such as pixel 141d it is important that the doped contacting regions extend as deep into the pixel as possible in order to ensure that a high electric field exists throughout the volume of the pixel. It apparent to one skilled in the art that it is also possible to place the n+ and p+ contacting regions 142d in other regions of the pixel (as opposed to the corners) as long as high electric fields are maintained throughout the pixel and that these contacting regions are covered with metal.",
        "The speed of the surface-illuminated PD can be increased by directing signal light into only a portion of the middle of the pixel; e.g., the portion that lies between the doped contacting regions, as shown in pixel 141c of FIG. 9a. In this case, photogeneration of carriers occurs only in that portion of the pixel, and, therefore, the maximum carrier transit time to the doped contacting regions is reduced (compared to the case in which the pixel is uniformly illuminated). To this end, at least 30% of the top surface area of the doped contacting regions should be covered by metal. Pixels 141a and 141b illustrate such partial coverage of the contacting regions, whereas pixel 141c depicts complete (100%) coverage, which is preferred. In addition, in each case the width of the metal not only covers the doped contacting regions, but also shadows part (e.g., at least 20%) of the top surface area of the intrinsic absorbing regions of the pixel between them. Obviously, the upper limit for metal coverage of the pixel is not 100% but a lesser amount determined by the trade off between QY (which favors less coverage) and speed (which favors more coverage). Together this criteria define another embodiment of our invention in which metal covers at least 30% of the top surface of the doped contacting regions and more than about 20% of the top surface area of the undoped absorbing regions of the pixel between the doped contacting regions.",
        "It will be readily appreciated by one skilled in the art that this embodiment of our invention of covering the doped contacting regions by metal can improve PD speed in any type of surface-illuminated lateral PIN PD.",
        "Another way to limit the long diffusion transit times for the doped contacting regions, in the absence of the type of metal masking described above, is to limit the volume of the doped regions compared to the volume of the pixels, which in practice means (i) limiting the depth of the implants to around 0.2 \u03bcm in SiGe pixels, and (ii) making the width of the doped contact stripes small compared with the width of the pixel. In accordance with another embodiment of our invention, the volume of the doped contacting regions within a particular pixel is less than about 25% of the volume of that pixel.",
        "Another technique for limiting carrier transit times, in accordance with yet another embodiment of our invention, is to use metal to cover the pixel stem region. An example of this arrangement is shown in pixel 141b of FIG. 9a. Here metal 147 completely covers the stem region 146. For a top-illuminated PD, this design eliminates signal light penetration into the stem region so that no carriers are generated therein. Carriers generated in the stem region would have long transit times to the contacts. In addition, with or without metal covering over the pixel stem region, the volume of the stem region should be minimized compared to the volume of the pixel. The pixel stem region is not used for light absorption; it may contain defects that generate dark currents. Therefore, one important feature of this embodiment of our invention is that the volume of the pixel stem region be less than about 25% of the volume of the pixel.",
        "Turning now to speed considerations of edge-illuminated PDs, FIG. 9b shows in plan-view several possible contacting arrangements for enhancing speed of operation. Unlike the previously described surface-illuminated PDs, it is not necessary to cover the doped contacting regions or the pixel stem regions with metal since incoming signal light is directed to the desired pixel regions (and away from the contacting regions) by means of a WG.",
        "Two different WG-pixel combinations are shown in FIG. 9b. The speed of the edge-illuminated PD is increased by injecting the light into only a portion of the middle of the detector. To accomplish this result the width of the WG section W1a (W1b) is made less than the distance W2a (W2b) between the inside edges of the doped contacting regions 157a and 158a of pixel 152a (157b and 158b of pixel 152b), and the axis of propagation of the WG is aligned to the center of the pixel portion that lies between the doped contacting regions. In this case, photogeneration of carriers occurs only in the portion of the pixel between the doped contacting regions, and, therefore, the maximum carrier transit time to the edges is reduced compared to the case in which the pixel is uniformly illuminated. Furthermore this type of alignment ensures that the light is kept out of the highly doped contacting regions where diffusion times would be long. This design of the WG and pixel also increases QY since the pixel is able to capture more of the signal light that diffracts from the end of the WG aperture. In addition, the offset design of pixel 142a, with the p+-type contacting region covering the stem region 151a, ensures that no significant amount of injected signal light 156a will be absorbed in the stem region 151a, which tends to be optically lossy. However, if the width of the stem region (as measured transverse to the direction of light propagation) is made less than one half of the wavelength of light in the stem region material, very little light will penetrate into the stem region. In this case the stem region need not be offset; it may be located anywhere in the pixel region where signal light 156b is absorbed (e.g., in the center of the pixel, as shown by stem region 151b of pixel 152b). Therefore, a further feature of this embodiment of our invention is that the width of the stem region is less than one half the wavelength of signal light in the material of the stem region.",
        "Another feature of the embodiment of our invention utilizing pixel 152a is that the width W1a of the WG should be less than the width W2a of the pixel, and that the propagation of the WG should be aligned to the center of the pixel. In pixel 152a the propagation axis of the WG 154 is aligned between the edge of the pixel and the stem region (i.e., between the inside edge of the n+-type contacting region 157a and the stem region 151a). This feature ensures that no significant amount of light is absorbed in the stem region 151a.",
        "PD Contact Configurations: Limiting Dark Current",
        "Another aspect of the current invention relates to PD contact configurations that reduce dark currents. These designs are illustrated in FIG. 10.",
        "High doping in the pixel stem region suppresses defect-generated dark currents. Therefore, in accordance with another embodiment of our invention the pixel stem regions are doped with either an n-type or p-type dopant to suppress dark current generation. This doping can be introduced in the stem regions 188a, as shown in FIG. 10a, during the pixel (e.g., SiGe) growth. Here, the stem region 188a is in-situ doped n-type, and the pixel is undoped or low doped. This difference in doping is accomplished, for example, by changing the dopant gas flows during epitaxial growth.",
        "Another doping issue is a function of the dopant type of the substrate. Again, with reference to FIG. 10a, if the substrate 171 is contacted and is doped p-type (n-type), a large leakage current can flow from the substrate contact to either the p+-type contact regions 179 (n+-type contact regions 178) in the pixel. For this reason, it is important that a reverse-biased PN junction be positioned between the substrate and the pixel. This junction can be accomplished in two ways. First, as shown in FIG. 10b, a PN junction blocking region 189b is formed in the substrate 171 and under the pixel 175 using ion implantation prior to deposition of the stem cladding region 188b. If the substrate doping is p-type (n-type), a thin n-type (p-type) region 189b should be introduced between the substrate and the pixel region 188b. In this case, the blocking PN junction is defined by the interface 190b between the implanted region 189b and the Si substrate 171. Second, as shown in FIG. 10a, the blocking PN junction is formed through in-situ doping of the pixel 175 and stem region 188a. In this case, the blocking junction is formed at the interface 190a between the n-type stem region 188a and the p-type substrate 171. This design also has the benefit of reducing possible sources of dark current. Therefore, it is also an aspect of the current invention that a PN junction is interposed between the substrate and the low doped body of the pixel.",
        "It is to be understood that the above-described arrangements are merely illustrative of the many possible specific embodiments that can be devised to represent application of the principles of the invention. Numerous and varied other arrangements can be devised in accordance with these principles by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In particular, surface-illuminated embodiments of our invention may be front (top)-side illuminated, as previously described, or may be back (bottom)-side illuminated. In the latter case, signal light cannot be blocked from entering the doped contacting regions by metal, and so in order to avoid diffusion time limitations, the volume of the doped contacting region should be small; i.e., less than about 25% of the volume of the pixel. Also, in back-illuminated PDs, where the metal electrodes are on the front surface, there are no metal lines to block signal light from entering the stem regions. Therefore, the volume of the stem regions should be kept relatively small; e.g., less than about 25% of the volume of the pixel."
