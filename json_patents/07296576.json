        "The present patent application relates generally to the technical field of solubilization of nanomaterials, compositions and methods therefor.",
        "Pristine nanotubes are generally insoluble in common solvents and polymers. Such nanotubes are also difficult to chemically functionalize without altering the desirable intrinsic properties of nanotubes. Single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) have been solubilized in organic solvents and water by polymer wrapping (Dalton et al., (J. Phys. Chem. B (2000) 104, 10012); Star et al. (Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. (2001) 40, 1721), and O'Connell et al. (Chem. Phys. Lett. (2001) 342, 265)), and noncovalently functionalized by adhesion of small molecules for protein immobilization (Chen et al., (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 123:3838 (2001))). The polymer wrapping approach works poorly for dissolution of small diameter SWNTs possibly due to unfavorable polymer conformations.",
        "A process of noncovalent functionalization and solubilization of carbon nanotubes is described by Chen, J. et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 124, 9034 (2002)) which process results in excellent nanotube dispersion using a nonwrapping approach. SWNTs were solubilized in chloroform with poly(phenyleneethynylene)s (PPE) along with vigorous shaking and/or short bath-sonication as described by Chen et al. (ibid) and in U.S. Patent Publication No. U.S. 2004/0034177 published Feb. 19, 2004, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/318,730 filed Dec. 13, 2002; the contents of such patent applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. The rigid backbone of a PPE cannot wrap around the SWNT in contrast to the polymer wrapping approach described above. The major interaction between the polymer backbone and the nanotube surface is described as parallel \u03c0-stacking. Thin film visible and near-infrared spectroscopy of PPE-solubilized nanomaterial demonstrated that the electronic structures are basically intact after solubilization. One such PPE-solubilized nanomaterial sample was obtained by filtration and redissolved in chloroform to a concentration of about 0.1 to 0.2 mg/mL (Chen et al. (ibid) and in U.S. Patent Publication No. U.S. 2004/0034177 published Feb. 19, 2004, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/318,730 filed Dec. 13, 2002).",

        "Polymers for Solubilizing Nanomaterial: Polymers for solubilizing nanomaterial are rigid rods having at least one functional group for solubilizing nanomaterial, a length of about 25 nm to about 110 nm, and a polydispersity of less than about 2. Such polymers are poly(aryleneethynylene) polymers, poly(ferrocenylaryleneethynylene) polymers poly(ferrocenylethynylene) polymer, for example, and are rigid, \u03c0-conjugated polymers, the backbone of which noncovalently binds to the nanomaterial in a non-wrapping fashion. By virtue of functional groups present on the backbone of the polymer, the polymers solubilize the nanomaterial.",
        "Polymer length ranges between a minimum length to effect solubilization which is about 25 nanometers and a maximum length that avoids hairpin formation which is about 110 nanometers. That is, an effective polymer has a length that is shorter than a length at which it folds back on itself. Polymers of the present embodiments have a length of between about and including any of 25 nm, 30 nm, 35 nm, 40 nm, 45 nm, 50 nm, 55 nm, 60 nm, 65 nm, 70 nm, 75 nm, 80 nm, 85 nm, 90 nm, 95 nm, 100 nm, 105 nm, and 110 nm. Polymers of the present embodiments having a length of about 25 nm to about 110 nm have a number of polymer repeating units depending upon the length of the monomer unit. The number of repeating units is between about 45 to 200 when the repeating unit contains one aryleneethynylene unit since one benzene ring together with one triple bond has a length of about 5.4 \u212b. Forty-five to 200 of such repeating units provides a polymer length of about 24.3 nm to about 108 nm. The number of repeating units of a polymer having monomers that contain two aryleneethynylene units is one-half that of a polymer having one aryleneethynylene, thereby maintaining the desired length of polymer backbone. The number of repeating units for a multiple ring poly(aryleneethynylene), a poly(ferrocenylaryleneethynylene) polymer or a poly(ferrocenylethynylene) polymer can be calculated based upon the length of the monomer. In certain embodiments, the number of repeating units is equal to or within a range of any of the following numbers of units: 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, and 200. The number of repeating units is determined by proton NMR, for example.",
        "Polymers of the present embodiments have a polydispersity of less than about 2. Polydispersity is the weight-average molecular weight of a polymer divided by the number average molecular weight of the polymer. If polymer chains have a uniform chain length, the polydispersity is 1. Typical values for polydispersity vary depending upon the mechanism of polymerization and are affected by reaction conditions, for example, for addition polymerization, polydispersity values may be between 10 and 20 whereas step polymerization may provide polydispersity values of about 2 to 3 and \u201cliving polymerization\u201d may provide a polydispersity value of about 1.",
