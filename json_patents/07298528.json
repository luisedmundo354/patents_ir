        "The present invention relates to printed products and a method for printing the same, such as banknotes, passports, stocks/bonds, cards, and valuable printed products, which require anti-forgery and anti-alteration functions.",
        "Along with the recent increase in image quality of color copying machines and the progress in computerization of color plate making techniques, the forgery means for banknotes or stocks/bonds tends to become rich in variety. Especially, since image input/output devices used in the printing industry are obtaining much higher resolutions, it is becoming easy to extract thin lines or microcharacters used in stocks/bonds. This makes it possible to not only forge printed products by a general commercial printing method using simple four color halftone dots but also accurately extract, by using input/output devices such as scanners, designs using two values of white and black such as ground tints, lathe works, or relief patterns employed for many of current stocks/bonds. Hence, counterfeits are made more realistic by using various special color plates.",

        "In the printing industry, halftone dots are always necessary for expressing a halftone dot image, i.e., a continuous-tone image in addition to two values of white and black on a printing paper sheet. This depends on the human visual nature that recognizes an aggregate of small dots as one tone in identifying a grayscale. Since techniques for converting a continuous-tone image into a halftone dot image have been led by major platemakers, users cannot freely create halftone dots by themselves. In the recent plate making industry, however, a postscript (registered trademark) language as one of computer page description languages has been developed, and commercially available application software based on the postscript language is becoming popular. For these reasons, color printed products that integrate characters and images can relatively easily be created. In addition, as the postscript language is widely used, users can launch creating halftone dots.",
        "However, the technique for directly defining two kinds of halftone dot data in the postscript halftone dot generation method does not suffice for achieving the desired purpose.",
        "The present inventor has proposed, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-205917, an image processing method of uniformly laying out two kinds of halftone dot images on the same plane by applying the above-described technique.",
        "More specifically, a halftone dot printed product of the present invention provides a printed product which uses an infrared reflection (transmission) characteristic between a portion printed by cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y) inks used in known color inks and a portion printed by black (Bk) ink generally used and in which an invisible image is printed by the black (Bk) ink so that the image cannot be recognized unless a special authentication apparatus such as an infrared camera is used.",
        "The embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. The present invention is not limited to the following embodiments, and various changes and modifications can appropriately be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims.",
        "An example will be described as the first embodiment in which an image is printed in a predetermined region including a first halftone region having m\u00d7m pixels and a second halftone region having n\u00d7n pixels such that the image can be seen as a full-color image under ordinary light, and the other continuous-tone image can visually be recognized under a predetermined visual recognition condition different from the visual recognition condition and, for example, by using an infrared camera.",
        "In the first halftone region having m\u00d7m pixels shown in FIG. 1A, a halftone dot image P1 (FIG. 1B) laid out by circular dots 1 is printed by three colors, i.e., cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y). In the second halftone region having n\u00d7n pixels, a halftone dot image P2 (FIG. 1C) laid out by circular dots 3 is printed by only black (Bk) ink containing an infrared absorptive dye. As halftone dots 2 around the halftone dot image P2, three color solid images of cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y) containing no infrared absorptive dye are laid out.",
        "The shape of halftone dots in each halftone region is not limited to the circular shape. Instead, random dots or a special halftone dot shape with a degree of freedom, which is obtained by converting an input image with a design into continuous-tone halftone dots made of halftone dots (halftone screen) by using a special halftone dot generation method proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-268228 filed by the present applicant, may be used.",
        "FIG. 2 shows a partial enlarged view dl (FIG. 2B) of the halftone dot image P1 (FIG. 2A) generated by a technique for directly defining two kinds of halftone dot data in the postscript halftone dot generation method, a partial enlarged view d2 (FIG. 2D) of the halftone dot image P2 (FIG. 2C), and a partial enlarged view m (FIG. 2E) of an image mask generated by the image processing method of uniformly laying out two kinds of halftone dot images on the same plane, which is proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-205917 filed by the present applicant. FIGS. 2A to 2E explain halftone dot images of a cyan (C) plate in the halftone dot images which reproduce a full-color image containing cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (Bk).",
        "FIG. 3 explains that a visible halftone dot image d1\u2032 (FIG. 3A) is generated by image arithmetic processing of the partial enlarged view d1 of the halftone dot image P1 and the partial enlarged view m of the image mask, and an invisible halftone dot image d2\u2032 (FIG. 3B) is generated by image arithmetic processing of the partial enlarged view d2 of the halftone dot image P2 and the partial enlarged view m of the image mask. Image arithmetic processing of the invisible halftone dot image d2\u2032 and the partial enlarged view m of the image mask is also executed to generate a halftone dot image d3 to multiply the three color solid images of cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y) inks around the invisible halftone dot image d2\u2032.",
        "The inks that can be used in the present invention are not limited to cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y). A combination of three colors including two colors having a complementary color relationship and black (Bk) which has an isochromatic relationship to the two colors and contains an infrared absorptive dye can also be implemented. In this case, the first halftone region 1 having m\u00d7m pixels shown in FIG. 1 is laid out by double tones of two colors having a complementary color relationship and containing no infrared absorptive dye. In the second halftone region 3 having n\u00d7n pixels, printing is performed by using only black (Bk) ink which has an isochromatic relationship to the two colors having a complementary color relationship and contains an infrared absorptive dye. The halftone region 2 around the second halftone region is laid out by solid images of two colors having a complementary color relationship and containing no infrared absorptive dye, which are the same inks as in the first halftone region 1.",
        "A printed product thus obtained by this embodiment has the structure of a partial enlarged view P3 shown in FIG. 3D. In a visible state, the landscape P1 of a mountain is recognized, though it is difficult to recognize that the landscape P2 of a river is hidden. When this printed product is observed as an infrared photo, the halftone image of the landscape P2 of the river can be recognized as a latent image.",
        "An identification card is produced as the second embodiment. In a portion a shown in FIG. 4, a general halftone dot image which does not use the halftone dot structure of the present invention is laid out by cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y). A portion b shown in FIG. 4 is halftone-processed by a method based on the postscript halftone dot generation method by using the halftone dot structure of the present invention. No visible image is laid out in a first halftone region 1 having m\u00d7m pixels. An invisible image is laid out in a second halftone region 3 having n\u00d7n pixels by using only black (Bk) ink containing an infrared absorptive dye. A portion 2 around the invisible image is constituted by three color solid images of cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y) containing no infrared absorptive dye so that the second halftone region having n\u00d7n pixels has a black-color-based isochromatic solid image layout.",
        "FIG. 5 explains the halftone dot layout state of each color plate in the second halftone regions 2 and 3 having n\u00d7n pixels on the portion b shown in FIG. 4. When these halftone dots are superposed, a black-based uniform tint state is obtained. Hence, an invisible image P5 (FIG. 5A) cannot visually be recognized.",
        "When an infrared reflection/transmission characteristic between a portion d4 (FIG. 5B) printed by black (Bk) ink generally used and a portion d5 (FIG. 5C) printed by cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y) inks is used, and an invisible image is printed by the black (Bk) ink, the invisible image P5 on the portion b in FIG. 4 cannot be recognized unless a special authentication apparatus such as an infrared camera is used.",
        "As the third embodiment, an example in which production of an identification card is applied to on-demand printing by the method of the first embodiment will be described.",
        "A technique called \u201con-demand printing\u201d can be interpreted in various ways. It sometimes indicates short-run color printing, a service for continuously executing processes up to bookbinding and providing books just in time, or a service for outputting books one by one. Of such applications of a multifunctional printer, page variable printing takes the best advantage of uniqueness of the on-demand printing. This means to print different contents (information), i.e., \u201cvariable data\u201d and quickly and properly provides character or image information specialized to an individual or company through a \u201cpaper medium\u201d.",
        "Invisible images according to this embodiment are uniformly laid out on the same planes as those of face images c of individuals in FIG. 6. A variable printed product with four plates P6-1 to P6-4 is obtained by an on-demand printer. Personal names are also simultaneously variable-printed. In this embodiment, the personal names are added as visible information.",
        "When the printed product shown in FIG. 6 is observed by an infrared camera, the invisible images P6-1 to P6-4 which cannot visually be recognized are variable-printed by the four plates, as indicated by c in FIG. 7.",
        "As the fourth embodiment, production of an identification card is applied to on-demand printing by the method of the second embodiment.",
        "In each portion d shown in FIG. 8, a general halftone dot image which does not use the halftone dot structure of the present invention is halftone-arranged by cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (Bk) inks. Each portion e shown in FIG. 8 is halftone-processed by a method based on the postscript halftone dot generation method by using the halftone dot structure of the present invention. The portion e has a black-based uniform tint state. Hence, the invisible image cannot visually be recognized. Invisible images P7-1 to P7-4 are variable-printed in four plates by an on-demand printer. Personal names are also simultaneously variable-printed. In this embodiment, the personal names are added as visible information.",
        "When the printed product shown in FIG. 8 is observed by an infrared monitor, the invisible images P7-1 to P7-4 shown in FIG. 9, which cannot visually be recognized, are variable-printed by the four plates. In the second to fourth embodiments, each personal name and company name are also displayed on the infrared monitor. The black (Bk) component of the face image in each portion d in FIG. 9 is also displayed. Whether these portions are to be made visible or invisible can freely be arranged as a design, and the present invention is not limited to the second to fourth embodiments.",
        "According to the present invention, a continuous-tone image is printed by using halftone dots that can hardly be copied by a general plate making device and can be read by a machine, thereby preventing any forgery or alteration of a printed product. According to the present invention, one continuous-tone image can be printed in a predetermined region. In addition, two continuous-tone images which do not overlap each other are equally laid out in a predetermined region without fusing the halftone dots. With this arrangement, security printing by four color printing using cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (Bk), which is widely used in a general market, can be implemented at a low cost. When an on-demand printer is used, individual information such as a character, symbol, pattern, or grayscale image can be printed as an invisible image on each page of printed products which require an anti-forgery and anti-alteration functions, including valuable printed product."
