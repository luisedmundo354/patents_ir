        "Elevators are raised and lowered in guideways using cables which are called ropes. Rollers on the elevators move along the guideways, keeping the elevators centered.",
        "Uneven loads in elevators tend to tip the elevators. Undesirable tipping is controlled by simple or complex mechanisms. Occasionally when riding an unevenly loaded elevator a passenger is aware of sounds related to roller and guideway contact, particularly when starting. The problem of controlling tipping is particularly acute with large room-sized elevators.",
        "Needs exist to maintain elevators level with simple and easy-to-install equipment.",
        "Elevators are maintained in level condition by four fixed ropes or cables passing diagonally across an elevator in angularly related opposite directions. The ropes extend from opposite corners of the elevator to fixed upper and lower ends. Moving the elevator causes equal and opposite changes in lengths of the portions of the ropes extending upward and downward from the pulleys on the elevator, keeping the elevator level.",
        "A preferred elevator levelling apparatus includes first and second rigidly connected cross beams extending at angles across an elevator. Eight pulleys on the beams include four pulleys on each beam. Paired pulleys are positioned on axles at opposite ends of each beam for freely rotating on the axles. four fixed ropes extend oppositely across the beams and upward and downward from opposite ends of the beams. Each beam has two oppositely extending ropes. Each rope extends downward from a fixed position near a top of an elevator guide around a first pulley, across the beam, around a second pulley and downward to a fixed position near a bottom of the elevator. Raising and lowering an elevator with the crossed beams, pulleys and ropes constrains the ends of the beams and the elevator for equal movement along the ropes and maintains the beams and elevator in constant relation with respect to horizontal.",
        "A preferred elevator levelling apparatus uses an elevator having a rectangular planform. Pairs of pulleys are mounted near corners of the elevator. Ropes have upper ends fixed above the corners near an upper end of a guide and have lower ends fixed below diagonally opposite corners near a bottom of the guide. Each rope extends downward from its fixed upper end, passes around a pulley in one pair, extends diagonally across the elevator, passes around a pulley near a diagonally opposite corner of the elevator, and extends downward to its fixed lower end. Pairs of the ropes extend diagonally in opposite directions across the elevator.",
        "Preferably four ropes are used. Each of the four ropes is connected above a different corner of the elevator and extends downward and corner to corner across the elevator and around the pulleys and downward to its fixed position under a diagonally opposite corner of the bottom of the elevator.",
        "Stabilizing elevators for level operation fixes upper ends of ropes to diagonally opposite spaced positions above corners of an elevator. The ropes extend downward, and pass under and over pulleys at diagonally opposite corners of the elevator. Lower ends of the ropes are fixed to diagonally opposite and spaced anchor positions.",

        "The ropes and pulleys ensure that as beam 1 is raised or lowered, both ends of the beam must move equally. For example, moving the beam upward lengthens the portion 21 of rope 2 between fixed end 9 and pulley 5, and shortens portion 33 of rope 3 between fixed end 8 and pulley 43. Concurrently the lengthening of portion 21 shortens portion 23 of rope 2 between pulley 6 and fixed end 10. At the same time, and by the same amount, portion 31 of rope 3 between pulley 7 and fixed end 11 is lengthened. All lengthenings and all shortenings of portions of the ropes are equal. The portions have equal changes or deltas, although changes to the upper portions 33, 23 have opposite signs or directions than the equal but opposite changes to the lower portions 21, 31. The beam 1 is rigid.",

Paired pulleys are mounted near upper corners of the rigid elevator box or roof or on crossed beams in, under or on the roof. The function of the ropes and pulleys is similar to that described with respect to FIG. 2. The elevator roof or base has fixed rigidly interconnected beams 1 and 41.",
