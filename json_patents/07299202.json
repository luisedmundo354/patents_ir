        "eCommerce is a tsunami ready to hit every major supplier. Gartner estimates that eCommerce will grow from a $500 million market in 1999 to a $7.3 trillion market by 2004. Goldman Sachs estimates that computers and networking will be the second largest eCommerce market segment comprising 15% of the B2B Internet economy. This fundamental technology shift is revolutionizing the way companies sell, market and support their products. The consequence of failing to meet this second wave of Internet technology could mean extinction for many suppliers.",
        "To be eCommerce-ready starts with building an intelligent content and information architecture for supplier's product information\u2014an Internet-ready and transaction-ready intelligent multimedia product catalog. Today most companies have deployed simple catalogs on their Web sites in graphical form incorporating HTML and PDF formats. Although these catalogs have provided unprecedented viewing access they have one major drawback\u2014they can only be interpreted by people and not computers. Computer accessible intelligent product catalogs are the fuel of eCommerce, without them products can't be selected, transactions can't be completed, B2B exchanges are stalled and distributors and VARs are unable to book business over the Internet.",
        "Intelligent content is key to keeping channels and marketing partners efficient. Currently, suppliers who have taken the initiative in eCommerce are finding that they have to push content to many thousands of Web sites a day. If suppliers are not ready for online eCommerce they could be locked out of doing business with major corporations and limiting their reach with distribution channels. Suppliers who don't take control of their product catalogs will risk their brand identity in the eCommerce marketplace. Vendors who don't take the initiative to create catalogs in electronic form are finding that distributors, exchanges and portals are creating their product content for them. This can result in the vendor's products being reduced to an undifferentiated commodity. Additionally, distributors may have biases, causing supplier products to be de-emphasized against competitors. Any errors or inaccuracies penalize suppliers with unnecessary lost sales or product returns. Suppliers who take an initiative will have strong control over their brand and enhance their market position.",
        "Although the impact of these technology shifts is affecting all suppliers, network infrastructure suppliers have unique product characteristics and distribution channels that require custom strategies and solutions. The catalog content, architecture and design must support significantly greater product information and depth. Without detailed product documentation such as engineering drawings, installation specifications, CAD Symbols and other data suppliers risk a reduced ability to be \u201cdesigned-in\u201d to network infrastructure projects. The workflow involved in designing products requires reference to technical specifications, drawings and CAD information. Without this information products cannot be incorporated in a Request For Proposal (RFP), or recommended for purchase. Procurement organizations often must procure based on a drawing for these products and not a specific Stockkeeping Unit (SKU). Network infrastructure products are installed in mission critical networks that cannot afford to experience any downtime. Service and maintenance on these components is critical. Documentation of all products must be available for years after their purchase. Any vendor who overlooks this requirement is making their product difficult to maintain and expensive in terms of total cost of ownership.",
        "Electronic product catalogs have become a prerequisite for capturing and maintaining strategic relationships between major corporations. Ninety percent of the procurement organizations of Fortune 1000 have electronic purchasing/exchange projects in progress or planning. The return on investment (ROI) for these companies is compelling. It costs large companies approximately $80-$200 per paper purchase order (PO). With electronic purchasing through an exchange this is reduced to about $8-$10. An electronic exchange can also prevent \u201crogue purchases\u201d and help a company realize significant discounts as a result of larger volume purchases per approved vendor. An electronic catalog is the prerequisite for all eCommerce transactions today and tomorrow. Although end users/exchanges/distributors are entering product content on their own without the assistance of suppliers, any vendor who can offer their product content in a useful form and capture the critical approved vendor list (AVL) slots will take business away from their competitors. As the number of suppliers is reduced, revenue from existing accounts will be increased. Finally, a large barrier to entry will be established as it will be difficult for competitors to unseat an existing approved vendor. Network infrastructure product companies have some unique business requirements. Their products have long life cycles after initial selection and procurement. Network infrastructure products are technically complex, with extensive issues with respect to configuration, software releases and compatibility. Total cost of ownership of network infrastructure products often exceeds initial procurement cost due to being components of mission critical networks where any downtime experienced with the product can result in millions of dollars or loss, and networks infrastructures have extensive maintenance, monitoring and repair organizations to keep their eCommerce and internal operations running.",
        "If vendors address the total cost of ownership associated with their products then their value proposition to the end user will be greatly enhanced. Complex sales processes affect the ability to be \u201cdesigned-in\u201d to network infrastructure projects. The workflow involved in designing and maintaining network infrastructure products during the \u201ccradle to grave\u201d life cycle is complex, involves many manual steps and many external companies/organizations. The sales process involves indirect channels for distribution and many professional services organizations which recommend, design-in, install and service the products. The procurement process for complex products often requires references to technical specifications and drawings to execute a purchase transaction. If vendors address the process associated with selling and influencing the recommendation of their products then their value proposition to the value added resellers (VARs), distributors, partners and influencers in the sales cycle will be greatly increased.",
        "Companies are discovering that the existing catalogs on their web site are obsolete and insufficient for eCommerce. While existing catalogs will support human viewing they are not structure to assist software programs in completing transactions.",
        "Intelligent multimedia electronic catalogs allow a supplier's product to be designed into complex network infrastructure projects while providing effective and efficient control of the supplier's content. Intelligent multimedia electronic catalogs incorporate intelligence by structuring product data to support electronic search and export. The data must be standardized and cross referenced. The catalog must be flexible enough to handle unlimited attributes, product categories and data types. A publishing engine controlling the representation and distribution of product content is key to preserving a supplier's brand in this new era of eCommerce. This enables partners access to content while preserving brand identity by using tools that both push content to partners and pull viewers back to the supplier. Supporting the number of different viewing audiences for product information requires an architecture and structures designed into the catalog to satisfy all of the combinations and permutations of languages, file formats, browser types that must access the catalog.",
        "In one preferred embodiment an intelligent multimedia electronic catalog (e-catalog or third generation catalog) for network infrastructure products is provided. The complexity of network infrastructure products, workflow, distribution, procurement and life cycle maintenance requires more documentation and tools than conventional maintenance, repair and operation (MRO) catalogs. Network infrastructure products have numerous technical documents which must be available during the design, procurement, installation, test and maintenance cycle. Network infrastructure products also require configuration information for design and procurement. Tools must be built into the electronic catalog to assist in this process. Technical specifications differ between products, thus requiring comparison tools for price/performance analysis. Technical information regarding these products must be developed by experts with industry specific domain knowledge. Network infrastructure products have unique use models due to the numerous organizations involved in their life cycle and the associated complex workflow. Electronic catalogs must provide for rapid development times as eCommerce requires fast reactions to changing market conditions.",
        "The present invention provides an intelligent product catalog system for electronic creation, management and viewing of product information using a multimedia display system. A central database repository for storing the product information provides for an unlimited number of product attributes and dynamic reconfiguration of the product information. The central database repository comprises a meta data system, a scheme system and an object model system. A plurality of applications access the central database repository, the applications being automatically adaptive to the dynamic reconfiguration of the product information. A user interface provides display, sorting and filtering of the product information including the unlimited number of product attributes. Specific products, comprising components, are selected based upon the product information, the selected products compose a system. The display of product and system data is dynamically rerendered to reflect added product options. The scheme system provides configuration rules for configuring products based on the product information. The configuration rules provide for presenting only valid configurations of product options for the products. The configuration rules provide budget based configuration analysis such only the addition of product options that are within a predefined limit are presented. The budget is based upon at least one of: dimensions, weight, temperature, power consumption, air flow and cost. The configuration rules provide for presenting completed product bill of materials information prior to the bill of materials information entering an order entry system. The configuration rules provide for presenting only options that do not conflict with other options already selected for the product. A reporting engine tracks and records activity of actual product selection criteria used during a user session. A syndication and publication system provides for exporting of custom formatted product information. Exporting can be done periodically and at predefined intervals. The display includes an intelligent bill of materials displaying selected products and selected options for displaying products associated with a system, the display providing drill down for detailed information on the product. One preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a system for the creation of an intelligent multimedia e-catalog for network infrastructure products.",

        "All of the major technology leaders, including Sun Microsystems and Microsoft, have converted a majority of their products to be XML already. XML is seen as a key competitive advantage. Several venture capitalists see XML as such a major technology that they have formed specialized funds to back XML startups.",
        "Unlike true commodities, technically complex products (e.g., network infrastructure components) require a broad set of attributes to properly describe and differentiate their capabilities. The breadth of product attributes required for network infrastructure products include: description, procurement attributes such as: price, availability, proximity, geometry attributes, technical performance attributes, reliability attributes, and hazard/safety attributes. It is critical that the e-catalog software and its user interface support this breadth of attributes during both query and display functionality in an easy to use interface.",
        "Flexibility is required to create an unlimited number of product categories without custom programming. The e-catalog is designed with a unique scheme that can handle any kind of product definition. This is different from other catalogs that require custom programming to incorporate new products with different attributes.",
        "The e-catalog illustrates catalog parts (components) utilizing intelligent vector graphics. Network infrastructure products are technically complex, often with many sub assemblies and separately purchased options. It is not sufficient to show a simple photograph in JPEG format for users to make product decisions. The present invention provides a fully illustrated parts catalog showing all of the subassemblies for a product in an easy to read 3D engineering drawing.",
        "The e-catalog has a flexible and scalable architecture with modular product design allowing for a phased implementation. The catalog has been designed to be modular, as a result you can implement your e-catalog solution in phases. Scalable architecture provides long term growth. Due to large audiences, the e-catalog has been designed to scale and provide performance regardless of load or depth and breadth of content. Many suppliers in the eCommerce space have offered attractive solutions only to obviate the benefits by making critical mistakes in the architecture design. This has rendered the products useless when large number of users attempt to access the product. More importantly, due to rapidly changing technology, they have missed important shifts such as XML which make development extremely efficient and facilitate unprecedented integration between companies.",
        "The e-catalog leverages industry standards to insure ease of integration. The e-catalog leverages industry standards from the database layer to the user interface layer. Standards such as SQL are used at the relational database layer. XML is leveraged throughout the product to assure long term viability in eCommerce. For vector graphics, SVG the industry standard set by the W3C and is adopted by Adobe, Sun and Microsoft is used.",
        "The present invention captures domain expertise which is key to deploying a useful product. In depth domain expertise in the network infrastructure industry includes development of a product catalog containing in-depth domain expertise for each product category. This is especially true of the industries that have very complex products (e.g., network infrastructure industries). Choosing a supplier that has in depth knowledge insures that the product quality and usefulness will be maintained. Learning curves and demands from internal staff are also minimized.",
        "The present invention avoids mistakes made by companies developing online catalogs. Normalized content assures retrieval of all products and content, poorly developed content creates inconsistencies in normalizing descriptions and units of measure. When these inconsistencies creep into the data, available products are often hidden from the customer's view. A well designed database scheme assures a rapid and complete search, designing the database is one of the most important parts e-catalog design. If the information model is poorly designed, users will experience poor response times and lack of usability. The information model must reflect all of the queries that a user could pose to the system. The model must also correctly represent the complex interrelationship between items, for example: what products are substitutes for each other, how users like to select products and how users find add-on products.",
        "The present invention incorporates four critical capabilities necessary to produce an intelligent multimedia e-catalog. These are 1) a critical mass of applications, 2) affordable \u201cone-stop-shopping service using an ASP model, 3) flexible and scalable architecture incorporating standards that assure long term growth, and 4) an ability to capture substantial domain expertise (e.g., networking infrastructure) into well designed and usable product. Conventional systems do not provide a total solution to the problems faced by complex product suppliers (e.g., network infrastructure suppliers). The present invention an intelligent multimedia e-catalog system capable of addressing the needs of complex product suppliers using a flexible and scalable architecture incorporating standards that assure long term growth.",
        "FIG. 1 is an illustration of an overall architecture for implementing an embodiment of the present invention. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention four major architectural elements are defined: a content translation system 106, a central database repository 108, applications 109 and access 104. The content translation system 106 provides inputting, formatting, editing and converting documents into a format for storage in central database repository 108. Applications 109 run on an applications server to provided access 104 at various integration points (e.g., Web browser, mobile devices, other programmatic access). The combination of the defined elements provide for an intelligent multimedia e-catalog.",
        "Content translation system 106 processes content for complex products (e.g., network infrastructure products) typically developed by industry \u201cdomain experts\u201d who have intimate knowledgeable of how content is used by consultants, channel partners, end users, installers, integrators and other parties involved in designing and maintaining networks. The present invention transforms the suppliers' content from paper, PDF, CAD drawings, and the like into intelligently structured content. The foundation of the present invention is structured content in XML format. The present invention uses XML to solve the major problems associated with conventional HTML based catalogs, which can only be interpreted by people and not computers. Utilizing these technologies, the present invention elevates the product content of suppliers' catalogs from brochureware viewable by people, to transaction ready catalogs for eCommerce computer applications.",
        "Central database repository 108 unlocks the islands of product information inside a suppliers business and provides a central repository of up-to-date product information that is Web accessible and transaction ready for computer use. The central database repository 108 stores items (e.g., parts/components) using a consistent object model for each item. Indices are maintained to improve access and update performance. Metadata is also stores, including product rules, business rules, historical information rules and system configuration rules.",
        "Applications 109 provide capabilities to access central database repository 108 to select components, configure products, collaborate on design, order components, provide support and manage administration of the applications. The applications 109 replace the paper, phone and fax based communication that currently clog the collaborative sales and procurement process. A user administration application provides account management and access control. A scheme application provides schema maintenance, including the addition, deletion and updating of attributes.",
        "Access 104 enable instant access in to applications 109 and the central database repository 108 in any format. The stored content is developed using XML and can be dynamically changed into a variety of formats necessary for eCommerce transactions, data interchange and browser access including wireless.",
        "The open systems architecture of the present invention adheres to industry standards providing for an open systems architecture not prone to obsolescence. The present invention is built to integrate best of breed applications servers through J2EE industry standards. Instead of reinventing the wheel like older Internet based products, the present invention's architecture allows for constantly improving applications 109. As the applications server market changes users of the present invention are free to change with it. The central database repository 108 is built around relational database. Database calls are JDBC compliant allowing the applications 109 to switch databases as needed. No database specific stored procedures or other utilities are required for an implementation of the present invention.",
        "The applications architecture provides for scalability and performance of the applications 109 over the Internet. In one preferred embodiment the applications 109 are built using a thin client model. All applications 109 can be built to be browser accessible. Suppliers and their partners do not require any special applications software on their computer or any extensive training on a new user interface in order to access applications 109. The applications 109 are built to change as business rules and processes change. The applications architecture provides for rapid change as the business rules are separate from the application code. The present invention therefore provides for rapid deployment, as no programming is required to make configuration rule, personalization or user security rule modifications. In one preferred embodiment Java-based applications 109 assure reliability, scalability and performance over the Internet. Java also assures an open application design and compatibility with leading hardware and operating systems.",
        "The present invention emphasizes two dynamics of information flow: pushing 140 vendor product messaging out to market (e.g., push publication of data) and pulling 142 of information into the applications 109 (e.g., pull of price, availability information).",
        "The catalog insures that all potential target audiences are reached by the supplier. The supplier now controls the product positioning and messaging with using a breadth of attributes. The vendor differentiation is protected by pushing very broad attribute data to the end user purchasing portals, marketplace exchanges and distributor catalogs. Using subscription agreements and a publishing engine the vendor enforces the freshness and accuracy of data by signing up subscription agreements. These agreements allow custom translation interfaces to be developed for each target portal. Distributors and exchanges are no longer developing content for the supplier.",
        "In all aspects the catalog pulls end users, partners and channel partners back to the vendor's Web site for complete information. Unparalleled technical documentation, product documentation, unique analysis tools and customer relationship management capabilities make the site a rich resource for any end user, distributor, or partner. Specialized hyperlinks are embedded in target portals allowing users to quickly \u201cpunch out\u201d to the suppliers site for more in-depth information. This protects the vendor's brand and enhances the relationship with the end user. By retrieving price, availability and proximity data from distribution partners automated routines allow procurement information to be retrieved from the suppliers distributors and VARs. This allows the end user, consultant or integrator to have a one-stop shopping portal for the supplier's products.",
        "FIG. 2 is an illustration of components as configured in a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The e-catalog 110 is comprised of a central database repository 108, applications 109, a syndication and publishing service 118, reporting engine 116. An interface for Web conferencing and customization/personalization 112 is also provided.",
        "Central database repository 108 stores information for e-catalog 110 and includes meta data 186 used to describe the data, scheme 180 used to define entities and relationships inherent in the data and reusable objects 182 used to represent the data.",
        "Applications 109 include Manage, Select, Order, Collaborate and Support. The Manage application provides user administration functionality which allows suppliers to create and manage user accounts and profiles. Security allows suppliers to secure their environment by assigning users permissions and controls for applications and views. Scheme allows changes to the attributes and objects to be displayed for products. Content Management allows suppliers to add, modify or delete content to the product repository. The Select application provides a guided sales experience for end users, sales representatives and channel partners by providing an intelligent multimedia catalog over the Web. The Select application is designed to accommodate complex products, that may have hundreds of attributes, dozens of documents, complex illustrations and configuration rules. The product centralizes all product information required in the sales process in a single repository. This allows suppliers to realize higher sales productivity, drive revenues and take market share from competitors by providing correct, up-to-date and easy to understand information on complex products to all of its partners. Select also provides for creating interactive electronic technical manuals (IETM). The Order application allows orders to be built correctly the first time, eliminating manual checking and dramatically reducing the supplier transaction processing costs per order. Customer satisfaction is improved due to clarity in the order building process. Distribution partners determine product availability, order confirmation, pricing confirmation and shipment status over the Web thus eliminating up to 40% of phone queries back to customer service representatives. The Collaborate application supports both procurement and design collaboration that occurs among the myriad of partners for a supplier. Online procurement collaboration replaces the manual process of assembling paper Requests For Proposal (RFP) and bid specifications. The Support application provides warrantee administration, point of sale analysis, and configuration management.",
        "The reporting engine 116 tracks user selection criteria and track types of technologies employed. Typical activity-based access reporting can detect what attributes are being accesses most frequently, but the present invention provides user-based access of specific attributes by detecting that certain users are selecting products using certain attributes (e.g., by color first, then by dimensions). This information can then be used by suppliers to optimize the presentation of their products. The reporting engine 116 provides management the ability to gain early insight into buying trends. Unlike conventional reporting which provides information about users, the present invention provides information about user activity. The most popular products and options can be identified before purchase or shipment. Management can now see what features customer are using to select products.",
        "The syndication and publishing service 118 provides customized content presentation for syndication and publishing applications. The central database repository 108 foundation facilitates ease of data mapping between the e-catalog 110 and outside data management systems. The data mapping enable suppliers to export catalog content to the myriad of distribution channels, VARs, private exchanges and partners who may require content to drive their portals, catalogs or e-procurement sites. The present invention manages the publication cycle using subscription agreements for sending data to, and retrieving data from, suppliers and their partners. The present invention creates the necessary transformation files to convert the excerpted product data into the desired file formats and standardized descriptions. Delivering data in a variety of formats, at different intervals, removes an enormous burden from marketing and IT staffs overwhelmed with requests.",
        "Web conferencing and customization/personalization 112 provides the ability to interactively confer on design, procurement, support and other decisions. By allowing parties to view draft configurations and proposals online feedback and revision cycles are reduced. This allows for higher quality products to be design in less time, with fewer mistakes. Additionally, customization provides for defining an unlimited number of views of data stored in the central database repository 108. Among the various views, some views can be country specific (e.g., filtering out products inappropriate for specific countries). Other views can be user specific, filtering based on user preferences (e.g., preferences for a specific supplier). By saving the definition of the customized views a personalized view can be build and used later. This allows suppliers to create views over a catalog; dynamically presenting different content to different users based upon login information. User can be targeted with different products to enhance sales campaigns. Geographic markets can be restricted to access only products appropriate for their markets (e.g., electrical connectivity, import/export restrictions, other government regulations, etc.). Data can be transformed on the fly to accommodate internationalization, a variety of output formats (e.g., print, CDROM, HTML pages) and browser support (including wireless) allows companies to reach new markets easier. Views also allow users to personalize and customize their own interface.",
        "FIG. 3 is an illustration of various ways in which the present invention is used to provide Web-based customer support. A high percentage of users leave Web sites because of lack of human interaction. This hurts both the selling and support process. With browser-based support integrated into the present invention, the e-catalog becomes instrumental in the day to day selling and support process for both end users and channel partners. World-wide applications of the Web conferencing capability include: sales conferencing with customers and channel partners which give the same experience as an onsite visit; higher conversion of browsers into buyers; lower support costs and improved customer service; and lowers telecommunications expense. Customers and channel partners 152 can now be assisted during the product selection, configuration and design process live over the Web. Collaborative sessions can include filling out forms for product selection or highlighting product specification information in white papers or technical specifications. The present invention's analysis tools can be used online to show the advantages of upgrading or selecting add-on products. By offering a similar experience of being onsite working with customers over a catalog sales personnel do not have to travel to visit users or partners on site. Market research shows that a high percentage of browsers leave a Web site before buying. By offering an ability to directly contact a sales representative by clicking a button on the e-catalog you can make contact with customers quickly converting browsers into buyers. Customers with support questions can select products before contacting support thus reducing the time spent during the session acquiring customer and product information. Product questions are answered quickly since both users are able to view the product information together. Both users are able to make notations on the web page during the conference. Email, text chat and support call times lead to greatly reduce telecommunication expenses. In addition, by providing voice over IP (VoIP) based telephony these costs are further reduced.",
        "Customer or channel partners 152, as well as suppliers 150 can interact with e-catalog 110 via various media options, including browser sharing 154, text chat 156, phone callback 158 and VoIP chat 160. The e-catalog 110 is thus used to provide Web-based customer support.",
        "FIG. 4 is an illustration of a Content Translation System configured as part of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The Content Translation System converts unstructured content 182 in the form of paper-based and 1st and 2nd generation electronic documents into XML-based structured content 184 for the intelligent multimedia e-catalog 110 using scheme 108. The structured content 184 is then accessed by design consultants, integrators and end users 186. The design consultants, integrators and end users 186 can then use tools 185, such as CAD tools, test tools, network management tools, network documentation tools and asset tracking tools to interact with the structured data 184 from e-catalog 110.",
        "Early innovators in eCommerce have found that they have to distribute their content to many as thousands of Web sites per day. Distributors, VARs, installers, partners, design consultants, integrators and outsourcers all require information, often on a daily basis. Unfortunately, each requires data in their own format which requires transforming subsets of the content on the fly into various company specific formats. The present invention manages the publication cycle by managing \u201cSubscription Agreements\u201d for an unlimited number of audiences. The subscription agreement details the required format and frequency of update for each subscriber. A dynamic data retrieval engine for pulling content from internal and partner systems, including bidirectional data update is fully facilitated by the present invention. Price, availability and proximity data can be retrieved from distribution partners and udpated in the e-catalog. The present invention fully accommodates the numerous custom formats for retrieving information from suppliers. A \u201cRetrieval Agreement\u201d details the required format and frequency of retrieval from each subscriber.",
        "Networking Products have a long life cycle after initial selection and procurement. There are a large number of documents that end users require for maintenance, monitoring and repair to keep internal operations up and running for years after the initial installation. To support procurement of replacement parts a fully interactive technical manual must be fully integrated with the e-catalog 110. Network infrastructure products have extensive documentation necessary during the entire life cycle which must be fully cross referenced in the catalog, including: data sheets, white papers, mechanical drawings, installation notes, specifications, photos and pinout schematics.",
        "Specialized tools for network infrastructure partners, end users and channel partners are needed. Network infrastructure products are complex with many subassemblies and options. Users and channel partners both need assistance in configuring products. Suppliers face numerous product returns, up to 15%, due to incorrect configuration. The e-catalog 110 content and structure supports three types of configuration: a basic configurator; an \u201cupsell\u201d analyzer; and an \u201cadd on sell\u201d analyzer. The basic configurator insures that the products being selected are compatible and that the configuration is correct. The \u201cupsell\u201d analyzer illustrates the cost and benefit of \u201cupgrading\u201d the users product selection to a higher revenue/margin product line (e.g., users can see the price/performance tradeoffs of selecting 1000BT over 100BT or CAT 7 vs CAT 6). The \u201cadd on sell\u201d analyzer analyzes a set of selected products for completeness and suggests compatible complementary products. This will suggest add on products for a configuration to the user or design consultant.",
        "Due to the long life cycle of network infrastructure products, users require information on product discontinuance and substitution options. Often users need to inquire years after the initial purchase in a very mission critical network. Information must be delivered quickly and accurately. Simple photographs of products do not convey the detail required for determining substitutability.",
        "CAD symbols and parametric information are keys to being \u201cdesigned into\u201d a network. Offering the complete tools necessary for implementation of a product is key. Delivery of CAD information by the vendor removes unnecessary time and iterations in the design process. Offering CAD symbols that can be customized on the fly for different CAD Packages supports all of the segments in the market. The content translation system 106 provides the functionality to achieve these benefits.",
        "FIG. 5 is an illustration of the central database repository. Reusable objects 182 provide a consistent object model for representing product information. The content translation process 106 creates reusable objects of information for every product, so that data is entered once and transformed many times. This allows the present invention to minimize the amount of data that must be entered to just the essential elements. Ensuring that an element is entered only once guarantees data integrity and minimizes errors resulting from needless repetitive entry. The objects stored in the central database repository 108 comprise five different types: parametric objects 195, graphic objects 196, document objects 197, configuration business rule objects 198, and procurement rule objects 199. The content can be stored in a relational database or linked file system.",
        "A scheme 180 defines the organization data for fast retrieval and data interchange by any combination of attributes. The scheme is specially designed to accommodate complex products, which are described by hundreds of attributes, dozens of documents, complex illustrations and esoteric configuration rules. The objects for each part/product are collected in one central repository built for scalability. As user access, content size and computer access grows, performance is maintained. The scheme 180 enables users to query by any combination of objects while providing faster retrieval performance than is offered by traditional SQL queries.",
        "Meta data 186 eliminates the extensive programming required to customize most applications. Changes to the meta data 186 in the central database repository 108 drive changes to the software eliminating as much as $2 spent on customization for every $1 spent on the application. The information model of the central database repository 108 provides for the addition of unlimited product categories, attributes, configuration rules and multimedia content without any software reprogramming.",
        "FIG. 6 is an illustration of the object model and meta data components of the central database repository. The object model 188 interacts with the parametric objects, graphic objects, document objects, configuration business rule objects, and procurement rule objects to represent a product. Products are made up of parts or components. A bill of materials (BOM) for a product lists its parts. Each part may have a list of accessories (options) for that part. Offering the users accessories at design time enhances the chance that the user will purchase additional options because of the ease of use and guarantee that the options are appropriate.",
        "An important part of the meta data 186 are sets of rules, including business rules 190, replacement/substitution parts (i.e., history) rules 192 and system configuration rules 194. Business rules 190 define appropriate configurations of products and can detect improper combinations. For example, when designing a telecommunications closet an equipment cabinet may be required. Since venting of equipment cabinet in order to reduce heat buildup is required, a fan is typically installed in the cabinet. But, because some fans are only appropriate for top mounting and other are only appropriate for side mounting, the designer must choose the correct type in order for the equipment cabinet to perform properly. Conventionally, a designer would gather this information through past experience, by combing over paper-based catalog specifications or by making numerous call to the supplier's customer support staff. The business rules 190 provide for encoding of configuration information such that compatibility checking is done automatically.",
        "Replacement/substitution parts rules 192 provide part interchange information. The life cycle of parts is variable. Some parts remain unchanged and in production for years, but others are replaced or upgraded while their previous incarceration are still installed in the field. An owner who need to replace a part must be able to find a suitable replacement. Replacement/substitution parts rules 192 provide mapping of parts to update/replacement information. This allows existing products to be maintained in a timely and effective manner.",
        "System configuration rules 194 specify system-wide constraints for products. While individual components within a system might meet all known requirements, their combination might violate a known system-wide constraint. For example, while each component within a rack of a telecommunication cabinet might meet all requirements, the combination of components may prevent the cabinet from interfacing to another required piece of equipment. System configuration rules 194 provide system-wide constraints checking. System configuration rules may also include \u201cbudget\u201d rules. Budget rule keep a running total of attributes of the product being added to a system to ensure that certain predefined thresholds are respected. For example, each product added to a system has a specific weight, any one product alone may not exceed the predefined weight threshold, but the sum of the product weights might. Other thresholds include dimensions, weight, temperature, power consumption, air flow, cost and the like.",
        "FIG. 7 is an illustration of the reusable objects. The reusable objects 182 include parametric data 195 (e.g, attributes), graphics 196 (e.g., bitmap and SVG), documents 197 (e.g., XML), configuration data 198 and procurement data 199. The present invention utilizes central database repository 108 to provide a product catalog (multimedia e-catalog 110) that accommodates a broad set of attributes and flexibility in creating an unlimited number of product categories without custom programming.",
        "FIG. 8 is an entity-relationship diagram of a schema configured according to an embodiment of the present invention.

The primary key in the data entry database must accommodate this intentional redundancy. This will then be turned over to the internal QA module for processing.",
        "Module 2, Internal QA 204, provides compare, internal QA, check-in and version control. It takes as input two copies of content for each SKU. It outputs a single corrected copy of the content for each SKU in the data entry database scheme. This module has three key functions: 1) compare 2) QA and correction and 3) check-in. The compare function executes a compare of the two copies of content for the SKU, any differences will be flagged by this compare utility. The QA and correction function allows the QA person to select and create a totally correct copy. The redundant copy will be discarded. The check-in and version control function works on the corrected copy of the data that has completed the internal QA cycle and will be checked-into a release area. The release area is the final stop for data kept in the data entry scheme. This area will have full source code control capability with versioning (equivalent to a PVCS-like system). Any further corrections to the content must be directed to these files. All prior versions will be kept under source code control.",
        "Module 3, Catalog Authoring 208, provides catalog authoring. It takes as input a single corrected copy of the content for each SKU in the data entry database scheme and outputs a database in the catalog scheme. This module will create a database in the catalog scheme format utilizing the following steps. Custom indexes for the final scheme are created. A custom indexing strategy is used so that small subsets of data can be kept at the client side. These small subsets would allow users to perform queries quickly without downloading all of the rows from the back end database. A transform is performed on the Data Entry Database Scheme to transform the physical scheme from the data entry database scheme to the catalog scheme. Some of the content can be stored in Oracle 8i (or other appropriate DBMS). Other data will be stored in a file system outside of the DBMS. Links will be created between the data content, including all of the links necessary inside and outside of the DBMS. This DBMS and associated file system can reside on a specialized file server and can be linked to the vendor's website in a seamless fashion. This module has a start/stop capability. If the processing time is too long the program will be stopped and allow for an incremental compilation capability.",
        "Module 4, Vendor QA 212, provides vendor QA, access rules and final release. It takes as input a database in the catalog scheme and outputs corrected catalog content, access permissions for each user type and vendor style sheet. Vendor QA allows product managers for each product the ability to provide final approval for publication of content. The supplier's product manager will be able to review the content using the catalog software used by the buyer. Corrections to content and reauthoring are provided. If the product manager encounters any errors they can make changes using Module 2. After making corrections in the data entry database they must repeat the authoring process to create a new copy of the catalog database. Once the content has made it through the final vendor QA cycle it is ready to be hosted and linked into the vendor Web site. The vendor can set access rules which govern access to different types of content and analysis tools. The vendor will be able to set access with simple check box using two parameters: user type and content/tool type.",

This will make the product catalog (e-catalog) look consistent with the vendor's corporate Web site. The look and feel of the e-catalog is describes using various attributes, including logo and placement, background colors, font size and colors per their corporate style sheet, as well as the use of frames. A predefined set of codes specifying language type will also be used. The browser type(e.g., Microsoft Explorer, Netscape Navigator, ect . . . ) and revision level will be specified in the header and this will be passed as HTTP data. There is no need to update this in a file since access to this information is available during the session.",
        "Module 5, Catalog Publication 216, provide catalog publication and live connection to distributor data for price, availability and proximity information. It takes as inputs a database in the catalog scheme and Web methods (e.g., connection to distributor/VAR systems). Module 5 outputs a catalog with distributor data integrated and a file for distributor data updates. This step makes the catalog live. In addition, data subject to frequent change and specific to distribution partners will be dynamically updated. The vendor must set a file which will govern the update process for information from the channel partners, including specific attributes, conversion for attributes, frequency of update, default language, DTD mapping, and the like.",
        "Module 6, Subscription Rule Engine 220, provides a subscription rules engine and takes as input business rules download by subscription type and a user changes notification profile. It outputs a messaging engine download rules file. The subscription model will refer to the rules for subscription by subscriber type. Based on previous downloads to each subscriber, the engine will setup a file which will tell the messaging engine exactly what content to send to whom.",
        "Rules by subscriber identity can be set by the user. There are three types of subscribers (channel, exchange and end users). Each subscriber will complete a subscription form telling the system what type of data they are interested in. Each subscriber type will have different options for different types of data. End users will be fed updates only for the type of data to which they are permitted access. Access privileges are set in Module 4 by the vendor. Updates will only be forwarded if the user has a) previously downloaded an excerpt of this content or b) indicated to the notification manager that they want notices and updates of changes. Distributors and VARs (channel partners) can select the breadth (number of parameters and data types) of data they want to download as well as the depth (number of SKU's) they want to download. Exchanges can also select the breadth (number of parameters and data types) of data they want to download as well as the depth (number of SKU's) they want to download. Each Subscriber will have to indicate transfer rules, including a file transfer method, a file format and the frequency of download. For the file transfer method each subscriber will be able to select eMail, FTP, or the like. ASCII file format settings will be able to be set including: tab delimited text, standard XML format or any proprietary format (e.g., gXML). The frequency of download settings include a \u201cby time\u201d interval, or a \u201cby change in content\u201d interval, among others. It is expected that large companies will have proprietary formats which the present invention will provide as a part of its functionality.",
        "Rules by subscriber type can be provided and are set by the vendor. Vendors can set rules for the minimum amount of data that channel partners and exchanges are allowed to download. This allows them to protect their differentiation. In addition to all of the standard content for each SKU, the vendor can set additional fields for download including: punchout links, branding marks and time stamps. A punchout link back to the supplier hosted catalog can be defined. This link can be set to the very top of the catalog or to be a specific SKU in the catalog. The vendor can insert a branding mark for each row in the distributor or exchange catalog noting that this is \u201cauthorized content\u201d. Additionally, the vendor can force the display of a time stamp for the data making sure that the freshness of data is enforced at the target web site.",
        "Rules by time of download are also provided. The breadth and depth of content to be downloaded will also be a function of prior downloads and the extent of revisions in the catalog. For the first time the catalog is published the subscription engine will send a full copy of the requested subset to each distributor, VAR or end user. The first time a VAR, distributor, or exchange requests a copy the subscription engine will send a full copy of the requested subset to each VAR, distributor, exchange. For all updates following the initial update to a VAR, distributor or exchange the subscription engine will send a full copy of the requested subset to each VAR, distributor, or exchange. The first time an end user requests an update on a downloaded document the subscription engine will see if there have been any changes for the entire document, symbol or CAD drawing. If there has been any change then the newly revised entire document, symbol or CAD Drawing will be sent. Documents will have change bars noting where changes have occurred.",
        "Module 7, Change Notification Engine 224, is a change notification engine which takes subscription rule user profiles, date and time, and new content publications (triggers) as input. It outputs a list of necessary updates for distribution. This module is a daemon which runs continually in the background. It monitors the required frequency of updates for each subscriber which is stored in the subscription rule user profiles and the most recent delta changes to the e-catalog. When there is a change in the e-catalog that affects an area that a subscriber requires for download then the module determines if it is time to send this change. For example, when subscribers want weekly updates, one e-catalog update can occur on Day 3. Since this change is before the required update cycle the change will be held until the clock registers a full week from the last update. If another update occurs on Day 4, then both updates will be forwarded when the clock registers a full week.",
        "Module 8, Data Push Engine 228, provides a data push engine and takes as input a list of necessary updates for distribution, and eMail addresses from the subscription rule engine.

        "Module 3, Market Basket 358, generates a market basket by taking a selected part from the query results screen and a list of parts (such as a BOM) as input. The market basket is a simple list of SKU's for a specific vendor. This market basket is used for analysis by the configuration tools or as a method to drive the download of extensive information per part.",
        "Module 4, Guest Registration 362, provides guest registration. It takes as input the access permissions per each user type (described in Module 4 for the Content Translation System 106) and outputs a list of known registered users. This module checks the users name and designated user type against a list of known registered users. If the person is not registered then they will be prompted to register. The registration form is then forwarded to the vendor for approval. The vendor will have to update the list of known registered users. For each new user registered by the vendors an eMail will be forwarded to user alerting them that they have been updated. If the user is registered then it checks to see if the type of download or tool access is permitted for this user type. If the user is not permitted to use the download or configuration tool they will receive a message denying access and then pushed back to the query module.",
        "Module 5, Configuration 366, provides configuration by taking the contents of the market basket and outputting a final list of configured contents to be handed off to the channels or stored for future use. This module completeness, correctness, upsell comparisons and add-on suggestions. To complete the assembly that the user is intending to build, the system suggests the remaining parts (sub-assemblies/assemblies) which are required and are not yet selected by the user. The system will check for the compatibility of the assemblies selected and suggest assemblies that are more efficient, have more features and/or have a better fit to the selected assemblies. This process references the product family attributes in the database. Related add-on products are suggested to complement the selected products, this process will reference the complements attribute in the database.",
        "Module 6, Customization 370, provides customization and takes as input the contents of the Market basket. It outputs formatted technical documents and triggers to the notification engine. For customization of the downloads the end user makes a selection of the documents needed (all or selected documents) and selection of excerpts needed if not whole document. Additionally, the end user makes a selected output format, if the option is available. After the selections and download of documents by the end user, the customization module sends a trigger to the notification engine for the first time download and gets the notification activated.",
        "Module 7, Change Notification Engine 224, provides a notification engine which takes as input a trigger from end user download customization or data subscription by distributors/VARs. Its outputs include new end users, distributors/VARs or market exchanges being added to the notification list with rules built in. The notification engine triggers the event for notifying the buyer while he is doing the downloads of the content if the supplier has pushed the updates to the end users. This feature is made possible when the user has requested this functionality while registering in the Module 4 above.",
