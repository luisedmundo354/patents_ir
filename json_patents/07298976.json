        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical network. More particularly, the present invention relates to an optical cross-connect (OXC) device for connecting optical networks.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Recently, practical use has been achieved of a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique adapted to transmit optical signals of different wavelengths through a single-core optical fiber. In additional, it is also now possible to transmit a larger quantity of data at high speed than previously known. Furthermore, the optical settings or switching travel paths of optical signals has been made possible in accordance with development of certain optical element techniques. As a result, the actual construction of an optical network based on the WDM technique is now possible. For such a WDM optical network, a bi-directional OXC device is used that includes a main unit comprising a pair of wavelength division multiplexers/demultiplexers and an optical switch, in which is similar to a general uni-directional OXC device, and an accessory unit used for separately processing forward and backward optical signals.",
        "For each wavelength division multiplexer/demultiplexer there is an arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) used to achieve an easy optical signal channel extension and a simple control, yet having a high degree of integration. For the optical switch, a 2\u00d72 space switch is mainly used. In addition, for each accessory unit adapted to process bi-directional optical signals, there are 3-port elements such as circulators, WDM filters, or wavelength interleavers.",
        "FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of a conventional WDM optical network.

The first reflecting part 880 allows only the channel \u03bb11 of the forward optical signal to pass therethrough, while reflecting the remaining channels of the forward optical signal. The forward optical signal reflected from the first reflecting part 880 is re-input to the second port 862-2 of the second circulator 862 which, in turn, outputs the forward optical signal to its third port 862-3 connected to the first port 864-1 of the fourth circulator 864. The fourth circulator 864 then outputs the forward optical signal, inputted to its first port 864-1, to its second port 864-2 connected to the second external port 852. The channel \u03bb11 passing through the first reflecting part 880 is input to the second port 8722 of the sixth circulator 872 which, in turn, outputs the channel \u03bb11 to its third port 872-3 connected to the first port 873-1 of the seventh circulator 873. The seventh circulator 873 then outputs the channel \u03bb11, which is input to its first port 873-1, to its second port 873-2 connected to the fourth external port 854.",
        "Next, the second case will be described. The backward optical signal inputted to the second external port 852 is first applied to the second port 864-2 of the fourth circulator 864. In turn, the fourth circulator 864 outputs the backward optical signal to its third port 864-3 connected to the first port 863-1 of the third circulator 863. The third circulator 863 then outputs the backward optical signal, input to its first port 863-1, to its second port 863-2 to which the second reflecting part 890 is connected. The second reflecting part 890 allows only the channel \u03bb22 of the backward optical signal to pass therethrough while reflecting the remaining channels of the backward optical signal. The backward optical signal reflected from the second reflecting part 890 is re-input to the second port 863-2 of the third circulator 863. In turn, the third circulator 863 outputs the backward optical signal to its third port 863-3 connected to the first port 861-1 of the first circulator 861. The first circulator 861 then outputs the backward optical signal input to its first port 861-1, from its second port 861-2 connected to the first external port 851. The channel \u03bb22 passing through the second reflecting part 890 is input to the third port 873-3 of the seventh circulator 873 which, in turn, outputs the channel \u03bb22 to its fourth port 873-4 connected to the first port 871-1 of the fifth circulator 871. The fifth circulator 871 then outputs the channel \u03bb22 input to its first port 871-1, to its second port 8712 connected to the third external port 853.",

The remaining channels of the forward optical signal are output to the second external port 902.

First, the forward optical signal input to the first external port 901 is applied to the second port 911-2 of the first circulator 911.
