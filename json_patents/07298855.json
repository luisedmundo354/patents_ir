        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "This invention relates to volume circuits that use resistive ladder circuits for adjustments of audio signals in volume levels.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "In the fields of audio devices and technologies, electronic volume circuits for fabricating electronic circuits are conventionally used for adjustments of volumes in audio signals. Japanese patent application No. 2000-28152 (i.e., Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-217660; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/773,646) disclosed an example of an electronic volume circuit that is driven by a single power source and whose components are fabricated together as LSI circuitry.",
        "In the aforementioned electronic volume circuit, the gain (or attenuation) of an input signal is controlled by selecting a tap (or a voltage division point) from series resistance. In particular, when the gain is greatly narrowed down, resistance division points should be extremely reduced in resolutions when selected. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately and sufficiently narrow down the gain of an input signal in a conventional electronic volume circuit.",
        "It is an object of the invention to provide a volume circuit having a high resolution in controlling and narrowing down the gain of an input signal by introducing various improvements in circuit configurations. That is, the volume circuit uses a resistive voltage divider circuit, which can provide a desired tap voltage in a high resolution. In addition, a resistive current control circuit coupled with the resistive voltage divider circuit is designed to eliminate unwanted influences on the output line resistance of the resistive voltage divider circuit.",
        "In a first aspect of the invention, a volume circuit comprises resistive ladder circuits (or resistive networks) and a switch circuit. The resistive ladder circuits provide parallel arrangements of lines of series resistances, which are arranged between terminals IN and OUT, wherein each line has a resistive element realizing a resistance that is \u2018n\u2019 (where \u2018n\u2019 is an integer not less than \u20182\u2019) times larger than an element resistance \u2018R\u2019. Herein, one line having the resistance \u2018nR\u2019 is connected in parallel with another line having series resistance that is \u2018(n\u22121)\u00d7n\u2019 times greater than the element resistance \u2018R\u2019, so that the overall resistance of the following lines in view of one line having the resistance \u2018nR\u2019 is equal to \u2018(n\u22121)\u00d7nR\u2019. The switch circuit operates to extract a \u2018desired\u2019 fraction of the overall voltage applied to the resistive ladder circuits via a desired tap selected from among taps that are linearly arranged with respect to the resistive ladder circuits.",
        "Specifically, each line contains a first resistive element that is not at all connected in parallel with a next line, and a second resistive element that is connected in parallel with a certain resistive element of the next line. Various taps are arranged along the first resistive element of each line, so that numerous taps are linearly arranged along different lines of resistive ladder circuits. Therefore, the switch circuit selects a desired tap from among these taps so as to extract a desired fraction of the overall voltage applied to the resistive ladder circuits as a fractional voltage output. In addition, the second resistive element of each line is connected in parallel with a part of the next line in connection with the \u2018common\u2019 terminal OUT. As described above, numerous resistive elements are connected in series and parallel with each other within the resistive ladder circuits, wherein each of them is actualized by various units of the element resistance \u2018R\u2019.",
        "An amplifier is used to amplify a fractional voltage output that is extracted from the resistive ladder circuits by the switch circuit. All the aforementioned components (i.e., the resistive elements, switch circuit, and amplifier) are fabricated together on the semiconductor substrate or board.",
        "In a second aspect of the invention, a volume circuit comprises combinations of resistive ladder circuits and amplifiers. That is, the first unit of resistive ladder circuits are actualized by multiple lines of series resistances arranged between terminals IN and OUT, wherein each line is connected in parallel with a part of the next line in connection with the \u2018common\u2019 terminal OUT. The fractional voltage output extracted from the resistive ladder circuits is supplied to the amplifier, which in turn provides an amplified output to the terminal OUT. In addition, an input terminal of a secondary amplifier is connected to the terminal OUT, and the second unit of resistive ladder circuits is inserted between the terminal OUT and the output terminal of the secondary amplifier.",
        "The second unit of resistive ladder circuits is actualized by multiple lines of resistive elements, wherein all or a part of resistive elements of one line is connected in parallel with the next line in connection with the \u2018common\u2019 terminal OUT. Specifically, the second unit of resistive ladder circuits provides substantially the symmetrical circuit configuration compared with the first unit of resistive ladder circuits with respect to the terminal OUT.",
        "In the resistive ladder circuits, each line has a resistance that is \u2018n\u2019 times larger than the element resistance \u2018R\u2019 and is connected in parallel with the next line. The total resistance of the following line(s) in view of one line having the resistance \u2018nR\u2019 is \u2018(n\u22121)\u00d7n\u2019 times greater than the element resistance \u2018R\u2019. All the aforementioned components (i.e., the resistive ladder circuits and amplifiers) are fabricated together on the semiconductor substrate or board.",

Each line is connected in parallel with a series resistance that is \u2018n\u2019 times larger than the element resistance \u2018R\u2019, so that the comprehensive overall resistance of the following lines is increased \u2018(n\u22121)\u00d7n\u2019 times larger than the element resistance \u2018R\u2019.\n    (2) The total equivalent resistance in view of the resistance \u2018nR\u2019 in one line becomes \u2018(n\u22121)\u2019 times larger than the element resistance \u2018R\u2019. Therefore, the second line of the resistive ladder circuits arranges taps among series resistances \u2018n(n\u22121)R\u2019 that are \u2018n\u2019 times larger than the original overall resistance \u2018(n\u22121)R\u2019. Thus, it is possible to provide \u2018desired\u2019 fractional voltage output with a very high precision, which is \u2018n\u2019 times greater than that of the first line. In addition, the third line arranges taps with a very high precision (or resolution), which is \u2018n\u2019 times greater than that of the second line. That is, this invention can increase the precision (or resolution) in providing the fractional voltage output (or in selecting the prescribed tap) exponentially as the number of lines of resistive ladder circuits becomes large.\n    (3) The volume circuit of this invention can introduce combinations of resistive ladder circuits and amplifiers, wherein the resistive ladder circuits R1 are specifically used for providing the fractional voltage output, and the other resistive ladder circuits R2 are used to control currents flowing in the resistive ladder circuits R1. The resistive ladder circuits R1 have multiple lines of series resistances between the terminals IN and OUT, wherein one line is partially connected in parallel with the next line in connection with the \u2018common\u2019 terminal OUT. The fractional voltage Vs extracted from the resistive ladder circuits R1 is input to the first amplifier A1, the output terminal of which is connected to the terminal OUT. The input terminal \u2018q\u2019 of the second amplifier A2 is connected to the terminal OUT. In addition, the resistive ladder circuits R2 are inserted between the terminal OUT and the output terminal \u2018r\u2019 of the second amplifier A2.\n    (4) Due to the provision of the second amplifier A2 and the resistive ladder circuits R2, the current that flows from the terminal IN into the resistive ladder circuits R1 is absorbed by the output terminal of the second amplifier A2. In addition, the resistive ladder circuits R2 perform current controls in such a way that the output terminals t1-t12 of the resistive ladder circuits R1 are all set to the same potential, which prevents the current from flowing between wires interconnecting the output terminals t1-t12 together. Thus, it is possible to eliminate unwanted influences due to wiring resistances Rm, which emerge between adjoining output terminals.",
        "As this invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, the present embodiments are therefore illustrative and not restrictive, since the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims rather than by the description preceding them, and all changes that fall within metes and bounds of the claims, or equivalents of such metes and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the claims."
