        "The new cultivar \u2018GG DEL PC06\u2019 is a product of open pollination in a heterogeneous population of Osteospermum mass selection. The new cultivar was discovered and selected by Leo Van Zanten in May 2004 in Carpinteria, Calif.",
        "Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar \u2018GG DEL PC06\u2019 by cuttings from adventitious shoots were performed in Oxnard, Calif., and has shown that the unique features of this new cultivar are stable and reproduced true to type on successive generations.",
        "The cultivar \u2018GG DEL PC06\u2019 has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature, daylength, and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype.",
        "The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of \u2018GG DEL PC06.\u2019 These characteristics in combination distinguish \u2018GG DEL PC06\u2019 as a new and distinct Osteospermum cultivar.\n\n    \n    \n        1. Large daisy type inflorescence;\n        2. Pale purple ray florets;\n        3. Dark blue disc florets; and\n        4. A free branching habit.",
        "There is no parent variety to compare to \u2018GG DEL PC06.\u2019",
        "In comparison to the commercially available variety \u2018Duesumpink\u2019 (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 15,938) \u2018GG DEL PC06\u2019 is taller and wider. Also, \u2018GG DEL PC06\u2019 has a wider inflorescence diameter and depth. Further, \u2018GG DEL PC06\u2019 has a wider disc diameter. Finally, the ray florets of the comparable variety \u2018Duesumpink\u2019 fade to a lighter color toward the base of the florets while the new variety's ray florets intensify in color toward the base.",
        "The accompanying photograph drawing illustrates in full color a typical plant of \u2018GG DEL PC06\u2019 grown in a 6-inch pot, planted late October and grown outdoors. The plant is 18 weeks old. The growing temperature ranged from 12\u00b0 C. to 15\u00b0 C. at night to 12\u00b0 C. to 20\u00b0 C. during the day. The colors are as nearly true as is reasonably possible in a color representation of this type.",
        "In the following description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used. The following observations and measurements describe \u2018GG DEL PC06\u2019 plants grown in Oxnard, Ventura County, Calif., during the months of October through February. The growing temperature ranged from 12\u00b0 C. to 15\u00b0 C. at night to 12\u00b0 C. to 20\u00b0 C. during the day.
