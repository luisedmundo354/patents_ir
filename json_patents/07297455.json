        "This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2003-203862 filed Jul. 30, 2003 and 2003-401422 filed Dec. 1, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "This invention relates to a toner used in image forming processes such as electrophotography, electrostatic printing, toner jet recording and magnetic recording, and an image forming method making use of the toner.",
        "2. Related Background Art",
        "With the spread of electrophotographic full-color image forming apparatus, a great variety of their uses have been developed, and a demand for image quality have now come severer. In the copying or printing of images such as catalogues and maps, the details thereof are required to be reproduced finely and faithfully. With such demands, a demand for the sharpness of colors also has been heightened, and it is desired to extend the range of color reproduction. In particular, in these days the advance of electrophotographic apparatus into the field of printing is marked, and also in electrophotographic systems, it has been required that colofulness, minuteness and graininess of image characteristics are improved to be at a level not lower than those in printing.",
        "In recent years, in full-color image forming apparatus such as full-color copying machines having been proposed, commonly used are, e.g., a method in which, using a plurality of photosensitive members, electrostatic latent images formed respectively on the photosensitive members are developed with a cyan toner, a magenta toner, a yellow toner and a black toner to form corresponding toner images and then a transfer material is transported between the photosensitive members and a belt-like transfer member to transfer the toner images thereto in a straight pass, followed by fixing to form a full-color image, and a method in which the transfer material is wound around the surface of a cylindrical transfer member set opposite to a photosensitive member, by the aid of electrostatic force or by mechanical action of a gripper or the like, and the steps of development and transfer are carried out four times to obtain a full-color image.",
        "Toners used in these full-color image forming apparatus such as full-color copying machines are required to be sufficiently color-mixed and be heat-fixed to a transfer material in the step of heat-and-pressure fixing, without damaging color reproducibility and transparency of overhead projector (OHP) images.",
        "To meet such requirements, as binder resins used in toner particles, it is preferable to use resins having higher sharp-melt properties. In recent years, polyester resins are used as the resins having sharp-melt properties. As polymerization catalysts used for the production of polyester resins used in the binder resins of toner particles, tin type catalysts such as dibutyltin oxide and antimony type catalysts such as antimony trioxide have been in common use. These techniques are still not fully satisfactory because fixing performance such as low-temperature fixing performance or high-temperature anti-offset properties and color reproducibility such as color mixing performance or transparency are important as performances of toners in order to satisfy functions such as high speed, high image quality and high minuteness which are demanded in the full-color image forming apparatus such as copying machines for full-color images.",
        "Accordingly, in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. 2002-148867 and No. 2001-64378, techniques are disclosed in which titanates of aromatic diols are used as polymerization catalysts or solid titanium compounds are used as polymerization catalysts.",
        "These proposals still have problems on fixing performance, color reproducibility and developing performance in some cases, and further improvement is necessary.",
        "The use of the resins having sharp-melt properties usually tends to bring about a problem on high-temperature anti-offset properties because binder resins have a low self cohesive force when toners melt in the step of heat-and-pressure fixing. Accordingly, in order to improve the high-temperature anti-offset properties at the time of fixing, relatively highly crystalline waxes as typified by polyethylene wax and polypropylene wax are used as release agents.",
        "However, especially in toners used in full-color images, because of such a high crystallizability of the release agents themselves and a difference in refractive index between toners and OHP sheet materials, the transparency may be damaged when projected through OHPs, resulting in a low chroma or brightness of projected images.",
        "Accordingly, in order to solve such problems, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. H4-149559 and No. H4-107467, a method is proposed in which a nucleating agent and a wax are used in combination to lower the crystallizability of the wax. As also disclosed in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. H4-301858 and No. H5-61238, a method is further proposed in which a wax having low crystallinity is used. As other waxes, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. H1-185660 and No. H1-238672, it is proposed to use montan type waxes as waxes having relatively good transparency and low melting points. These waxes, however, are not those which can satisfy all the transparency on OHPs, the low-temperature fixing performance at the time of heat-and-pressure fixing and the high-temperature anti-offset properties.",
        "An object of the present invention is to solve the above problems and to provide a toner having superior fixing performance and high-temperature anti-offset properties, and an image forming method making use of the toner.",
        "Another object of the present invention is to provide a toner improved in the dispersibility of colorant in toner particles and having superior color reproducibility such as color mixing performance or transparency, and an image forming method making use of the toner.",
        "Still another object of the present invention is to provide a toner which is superior in the running (extensive operation) stability of chargeability and can form images having high quality, and an image forming method making use of the toner.",
        "As a result of extensive studies, the present inventors have discovered that when using a resin synthesized using a certain specific polymerization catalyst, the above demands can be filfilled, and have accomplished the present invention. That is, the above objects can be achieved by the use of the following toner and image forming method.",

If on the other hand the wax is present on the toner particle surfaces in a large quantity, the wax may contaminate charge-providing members. For example, it may melt-adhere onto the developing sleeve to increase the electric resistance of the sleeve high-resistance and reduce the effect of actual development bias for the development, lowering image density, and as a result, development running performance (or development durability) deteriorates in some cases.

        "That is, when the wax, which is hydrophobic, is present at the toner particle surfaces in a large quantity, the toner standing dispersed cannot be easily wetted by the solvent and does not settle, and hence the transmittance comes to be as large as 70%. On the other hand, when the wax is present at the toner particle surfaces in a small quantity, such a resin as containing the polyester unit is present in a large quantity has so strong a polarity as to exhibit hydrophilicity, where the toner is uniformly dispersed in the 45 vol % methanol aqueous solution, so that the transmittance comes to be as small as 10%.",

Meanwhile, if the peak temperature of the maximum endothermic peak is less than 60\u00b0 C., the toner may have poor anti-offset properties. If on the other hand the peak temperature of the maximum endothermic peak is more than 130\u00b0 C., the toner tends to be inferior in fixing performance.",

        "Referring to a specific way of measurement, 10 ml of ion-exchanged water from which impurity solid matter or the like has been removed is made ready in a container, and a surface active agent, preferably alkylbenzenesulfonate, is added thereto as a dispersant. Thereafter, a sample for measurement is further added in an amount of 0.02 g, and is uniformly dispersed. As a means for dispersing it, an ultrasonic dispersion mixer \u201cTETORAL 50 Model\u201d (manufactured by Nikkaki Bios Co.) is used, and dispersion treatment is carried out for 2 minutes to prepare a liquid dispersion for measurement, where the liquid dispersion is appropriately cooled so that its temperature does not come to 40\u00b0 C. or more. Also, in order to keep the circularity from scattering, the flow type particle analyzer FPIA-2100 is installed in an environment controlled to 23\u00b0 C.\u00b10.5\u00b0 C. so that its in-machine temperature can be kept at 26 to 27\u00b0 C., and autofocus adjustment is performed using 2 \u03bcm latex particles at intervals of constant time, and preferably at intervals of 2 hours.",

If on the other hand the toner has an average circularity of more than 0.990, the spherical treatment must be carried out in excess to obtain such a toner, and the heat generated in such treatment may exude onto toner particle surfaces in excess to tend to contaminate members coming into contact with the toner.",

Around the photosensitive drum 1, a pre-exposure lamp 11, a corona charging assembly 2 as a primary charging assembly, a laser exposure optical system 3 as a latent image forming means, a potential sensor 12, four different-color developing assemblies 4Y, 4C, 4M and 4K, a detecting means 13 for detecting the amount of light on the drum, a transfer assembly 5A as a transfer means and a cleaner 6 are provided.",
        "In the laser exposure optical system 3, the image signals sent from the reader section 35 are converted into optical signals for image scanning exposure in a laser output section (not shown).

        "Next, a stated developing assembly is operated to develop the latent image formed on the photosensitive drum 1 to form on the photosensitive drum 1 a visible image formed of a negatively chargeable toner composed basically of resin, i.e., a toner image. The developing assemblies 4Y, 4C, 4M and 4K are alternately come close to the photosensitive drum 1 in accordance with the respective separated colors by the operation of eccentric cams 24Y, 24C, 24M and 24K, respectively, to perform development.",

Following the rotation of the transfer drum 5, the recording material held on the transfer drum 5 is repeatedly transported to the transfer position facing the photosensitive drum 1. While it passes the transfer position, the toner image formed on the photosensitive drum 1 is transferred to the recording material by the action of the transfer charging assembly 5b.",
        "The above steps of image formation are repeatedly carried out for yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C) and black (K), thus a color toner image formed by transferring and superimposing four-color toner images is obtained on the recording material held on the transfer drum 5.",
        "In the case of one-side image formation, the recording material to which the four-color toner images have been thus transferred is separated from the transfer drum 5 by the action of a separation claw 8a, a separation push-up roller 8b and the separation charging assembly 5h, and conveyed to a heat fixing assembly 9 serving as a fixing means. This heat fixing assembly 9 is constituted of a heat fixing roller 9a having a heating means internally and a pressure roller 9b. The recording material passes through the pressure contact zone between the heat fixing roller 9a as a heating member and the pressure roller 9b. Thus, the full-color toner image supported on the recording material is fixed to the recording material. That is, by this fixing step the color mixing of the toners, color formation, and fixing to the recording material are performed until a full-color permanent image is formed. Thereafter, the recording material having the image thus formed is discharged to a tray 10. Thus, the full-color copying on one sheet is completed. Meanwhile, the photosensitive drum 1 is cleaned by the cleaner 6 so that toners remaining on its surface are removed, and thereafter again put to the steps of image formation.",

The total weight of the measuring container 1-2 at this point is weighed and is expressed as W1 (g).
