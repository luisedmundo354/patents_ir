No. 10/433,412 is a National Stage application filed under 35 USC 371, of International (PCT) Application No. PCT/JP02/08477, filed Aug. 22, 2002.",
        "The present invention relates to a fluorine-containing nitrogen group compound, particularly a fluorine-containing nitrogen compound. The fluorine-containing nitrogen group compound is useful for fluorination of compounds having active functional groups such as oxygen-containing compounds and surface treatment, coating and cleaning uses of various materials.",
        "A large part of fluorine-containing compounds shows a specific biological activity and an excellent function which originate in a fluorine atom. In recent years, usefulness of introducing fluorine is recognized particularly in the fields of medicines and agricultural chemicals, and fluorine-containing compounds are increasingly required. Further, they are applied making the best use of functions thereof not only in the fields of medicines and agricultural chemicals but also in the wide fields, and the importance of fluorine-containing compounds grows high further more.",
        "Fluorine-containing compounds are scarcely present in the natural world, and therefore fluorine atoms have to be introduced in an organic synthetic manner. For example, fluorine, hydrogen fluoride and sulfur tetrafluoride are known as a conventional fluorinating agent used for the purpose of introducing fluorine. However, they are toxic and corrosive and have the risk of explosion in the reaction, and therefore they have the problem that a specific apparatus and technique are required in handling. Further, they have the defect that they are low in a yield in the reaction and inferior in a selectivity in many cases.",
        "In addition to them, various fluorinating agents have been developed in order to selectively introduce fluorine into oxygen-containing functional groups. Given as representative fluorinating agents are, for example, hydrogen fluoride-pyridine mixtures (Olah reagent), a Yarovenko reagent of a fluoroalkylamine type and an Ishikawa reagent which is a modified type thereof and diethylaminosulfur trifluoride which is known usually as DAST. However, all of them hold the problems of safety, storage stability and waste disposal after reaction, and the existing situation is that they are not necessarily satisfactory from an industrial point of view considering complexity in handling and the production.",
        "An object of the present invention is to provide a compound which makes it possible to fluorinate functional groups such as an oxygen-containing group, which is excellent in heat stability and can easily be handled and which can be produced at a low cost.",
        "Intensive investigations carried out by the present inventors in order to solve the problems described above have resulted in finding that a fluorine compound represented by Formula (1):",
        "(wherein X represents a nitrogen or phosphorus atom; R0, R1, and R2 represent hydrogen, an alkyl group or aryl group which may have a substituent, and they each may be the same or different; and R0, R1, and R2 may be combined with each other to form a ring) is effective for fluorinating various oxygen-containing compounds, can be distilled, has a high heat stability, is easy in handling and therefore can solve a large part of the problems described above and that the above compound is useful as well for uses such as surface treatment and cleaning. Thus, they have reached the present invention.",
        "Further, the present inventors have found that the compound represented by Formula (1) can be obtained by introducing fluorine atoms directly into a compound represented by Formula (2):",
        "(wherein X represents a nitrogen or phosphorus atom; R0, R1, and R2 represent hydrogen, an alkyl group or aryl group which may have a substituent, and they each may be the same or different; R0, R1, and R2 may be combined with each other to form a ring; and Y represents chlorine, bromine or iodine) using a fluorinating agent or subjecting it to halogenation reaction with a halogenating agent.",
        "The fluorine compound represented by Formula (1) in the present invention is, to be specific, a fluorine-containing nitrogen group compound and includes a fluorine-containing nitrogen compound in which X is nitrogen in Formula (1) and a fluorine-containing phosphorus compound in which X is phosphorus in Formula (1).",
        "The alkyl group represented by R0, R1, and R2 is preferably a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to 30 carbon atoms and includes, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, 2-ethylhexyl, nonyl, decyl, cyclohexyl, cyclohexyloxy, decalyl, norbornyl, bicyclohexyl, adamantyl and isomers thereof, and in addition thereto, it includes hydroxymethyl, hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl, hydroxybutyl and hydroxyphenyl.",
        "A group having 1 to 30 carbon atoms is preferred as the aryl group and includes, for example, phenyl, o-tolyl, m-tolyl, p-tolyl, dimethylphenyl and position isomers thereof, cumyl, mesityl, trimethylphenyl, hydroxyphenyl, naphthyl, methylnaphthyl, dimethylnaphthyl, hydroxynaphthyl, biphenyl, tetralyl, t-phenyl, anthryl, benzothienyl, chromenyl and indoyl. Allowed to be contained in these alkyl groups and aryl groups are other functional groups, for example, a hydroxyl group, a halogen group, a nitro group, a mercapto group, an amino group, amide group, a cyano group, a carbonyl group, a carboxyl group, an acetyl group, an acyl group, an alkoxy group, a sulfone group and other atomic groups.",
        "The fluorine compound represented by Formula (1) can be produced by various processes. For example, the fluorine-containing nitrogen compound can usually be produced by a method in which an N,N-disubstituted amide compound which is an amide compound corresponding to the compound represented by Formula (1) is used as a starting material to directly introduce a fluorine atom using various fluorinating agents or a method in which fluorination reaction is carried out with a fluorinating agent and in which halogen exchange reaction is then carried out subsequently thereto to introduce fluorine.",
        "The fluorine-containing phosphorus compound can readily be produced, for example, by a method in which a hydroxymethylphosphnium salt is obtained from phosphine and aldehyde and then reacted with amines.",
        "The fluorine-containing nitrogen group compounds described above may be used considering physical and chemical characteristics, that is, heat stability, reactivity, easiness in handling and a price, but the fluorine-containing nitrogen compounds are more preferred from the viewpoints of a price and handling.",
        "In producing the fluorine-containing nitrogen compound directly from the N,N-disubstituted amide compound, an oxygen-containing functional group can be fluorinated using fluorine, sulfur tetrafluoride, iodine pentafluoride, HF-bases and iodine pentafluoride-HF molten salts.",
        "The fluorine-containing nitrogen compound is directly synthesized preferably using HF-bases such as HF-triethylamine and iodine pentafluoride-HF molten salts taking the reactivity and the safety into consideration.",
        "One example of a process for producing the fluorine-containing nitrogen compound by halogen exchange shall be shown below.",
        "(1) An N,N-disubstituted amide compound is reacted with a halogenating agent to produce a halide of the amide compound (hereinafter referred to as a step 1).",
        "(2) Then, the halide of the amide compound described above is reacted with hydrogen fluoride or an alkaline metal salt of fluorine to carry out a halogen exchange reaction to thereby produce a fluorine-containing nitrogen compound (hereinafter referred to as a step 2).",
        "In the production of the fluorine-containing nitrogen compound described above, a chlorinating agent such as phosgene, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, thionyl chloride and oxalyl chloride are suitably used for halogenation in the step 1. An oxygen atom in the amide bond is substituted with halogen by virtue of these halogenating agents.",
        "When a chlorine atom of the chlorinating agent has a low reactivity, a halogenating agent having a higher reactivity is preferably selected from similar halogenating agents containing bromine and iodine to introduce bromine or iodine. Usually, halogenation of acid amides readily goes on.",
        "In the case of, for example, isobutyramide, the reaction is completed by allowing phosgene to flow at 20\u00b0 C. in dichloromethane to carry out chlorination (Organic Synthesis, CV 6, 282).",
        "The halogenating means described above provides a halide of an amide compound represented by Formula (3) which is a precursor of the compound represented by Formula (1):",
        "(wherein R0, R1, and R2 represent hydrogen, an alkyl group or aryl group which may have a substituent, and they each may be the same or different; R0, R1, and R2 may be combined with each other to form a ring; and Y represents chlorine, bromine or iodine).",
        "In the production of the fluorine-containing nitrogen compound described above, it is difficult to definitely prescribe the conditions of a halogen exchange reaction carried out by a conventionally known process using hydrogen fluoride and an alkaline metal salt of fluorine such as sodium fluoride and potassium fluoride in the step 2, but almost all of the individual reactions are well known, so that the conditions can be decided with reference to publicly known literatures, for example, Journal of Organic Chemistry, vol. 44, p. 3872 (1979), Organic Synthetic Chemistry Society Magazine, vol. 47, p. 258 (1989) and Journal of Fluorine Chemistry, vol. 44, p. 291 (1989).",
        "Preferred as the starting material is an N,N-disubstituted amide compound having an alkyl group or aryl group which may have a substituent.",
        "The substituents may be the same as or different from each other and may be combined with each other to form a ring. Further, the substituents may have the other functional groups, for example, a hydroxyl group, halogen, a mercapto group, an amino group, an amide group, a carboxyl group, an acetyl group, a sulfone group and atomic groups thereof or may have similar alkyl groups and aryl groups.",

        "The fluorine-containing nitrogen group compound of the present invention obtained by the production process described above, particularly the fluorine-containing nitrogen compound can suitably be used as it is for fluorination of a compound having an active group which is reacted with a fluorine atom. An oxygen-containing functional group such as a hydroxyl group, a formyl group and a carboxyl group can be given as the active group which is reacted with a fluorine atom, and particularly, it is suited for fluorination of primary alcohol. It may be used together with an inactive solvent and diluent.",
        "The fluorine-containing nitrogen compound of the present invention can be recovered in the form of an amide compound which is a raw material for the fluorine-containing nitrogen compound after finishing the reaction with an oxygen-containing group, and therefore a fluorination process in which recycle is possible can be set.",
        "The fluorine-containing nitrogen compound can suitably be used for various fluorination processes such as not only an oxygen-containing compound and surface treatment of a material having an active functional group which is reacted with a fluorine atom but also coating and cleaning uses of a material surface.",
