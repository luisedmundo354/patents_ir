        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an optical fiber and a method of measuring polarization mode dispersion of an optical fiber.",
        "2. Description of Related Art",
        "In view of recent progress with respect to increasing transmission speed, and lengthening of transmission distance in optical communications, reduction of polarization mode dispersion (hereinafter, abbreviated to as \u201cPMD\u201d) is advantageous for optical fibers, that form transmission paths.",
        "The PMD of the optical fiber is mode dispersion caused a difference in group velocity between two orthogonal intrinsic polarization components, which propagate in the optical fiber. One source of mode dispersion is imperfections of the fiber optic, such as non-circularity of the core shape of the optical fiber, asymmetry of stress occurring in the core, etc.",
        "There are two parameters for determining the PMD. One parameter is the magnitude of local birefringence of the optical fiber, and the other is polarization mode coupling which expresses how the direction of a birefringent axis of the optical fiber changes in the longitudinal direction of the optical fiber.",
        "The magnitude of local birefringence of the optical fiber can be quantified by using a beat length, LB. Beat length indicates a propagation distance required for polarization in the optical fiber to rotate 360 degrees and return to its initial polarization state.",
        "Another parameter expressing the local birefringence of the optical fiber is a mode birefringence rate, B. The following Equation (1) defines the relationship between the mode birefringence rate, B, and beat length, LB.",
        "L\n          B\n        \n        =\n        \n          \u03bb\n          B\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        (\n        1\n        )",
        "In Equation (1), above, \u03bb equals the wavelength of light.",
        "When the length of the optical fiber is short, polarization mode coupling can be considered negligible. Therefore, for a short fiber optic cable, the PMD reduces to the expression according to the following Equation (2). As shown below, PMD is a function of light velocity, C, and the length, L, of the optical fiber.",
        "PMD\n        =\n        \n          \n            \u03bb\n            \n              \n                L\n                B\n              \n              \u00b7\n              C\n            \n          \n          \u00b7\n          L\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        (\n        2\n        )",
        "For a short fiber optic cable, Equation (2) provides that the PMD increases in proportion to the length, L, of the optical fiber.",
        "On the other hand, when the length of the optical fiber is long, the PMD is expressed by the following Equation (3).",
        "PMD\n        =\n        \n          \n            \u03bb\n            \n              \n                L\n                B\n              \n              \u00b7\n              C\n            \n          \n          \u2062\n          \n            \n              L\n              \u00b7\n              \n                L\n                C\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        (\n        3\n        )",
        "In Equation (3), above, LC is an average coupling length, which is a parameter expressing the magnitude of the polarization mode coupling. Equation (3), provides that the PMD increases in proportion to the square root of the length L of the optical fiber. As the polarization mode coupling increases, the magnitude of the average coupling length decreases. The magnitude of the polarization mode coupling is mainly determined by the distortion of the optical fiber, such as, a force applied from the outside.",
        "When the length L of the optical fiber is shorter than LC, the PMD can be expressed by using Equation (2). On the other hand, when the length L of the optical fiber is longer than LC, the PMD can be expressed by using Equation (3).",
        "It can be seen from Equations (2) and (3) that the PMD increases as beat length, LB, becomes shorter, and average coupling length, LC, becomes longer.",
        "The optical fiber is typically transferred to an optical cabling process in a wound around a bobbin state, or is typically shipped and transported as an optical fiber unit. Therefore, it is desirable to be able to measure the PMD in the optical fiber that is in the wound around the bobbin state.",
        "However, by winding the optical fiber around the bobbin, disturbances such as bending, lateral pressure, and distortion, occur in the optical fiber, thereby changing LB and LC, and hence the PMD varies. Therefore, in the same optical fiber, the PMD of the optical fiber wound around the bobbin for transport, and the PMD of the optical fiber after the optical cabling process, show quite different values (for example, see Scott Grindstaff, Joseph Hill, Omid Daneshvar, \u201cExtrinsic Stress Effects on Polarization Mode Dispersion in Optical Fiber Cables\u201d, International Wire & Cable Symposium Proceedings, 1993, pp. 647 to 654). The PMD of the optical fiber after optical cabling increases, and in some cases, exceeds an upper limit of the PMD specified by the standard, thereby causing problems.",
        "Moreover, the optical fiber is shipped to the optical cabling process in a length of about 20 to 100 km, and at the time of optical cabling, the length of the optical fiber is cut to 1 to 10 km. Therefore, if there is a place having locally large PMD, even if the PMD of the whole length of the optical fiber before optical cabling is small, when the optical fiber is cut and formed as a cable, there may be a place where there is large PMD, which can be problematic.",
        "The present invention takes into consideration the above situation, and an object thereof is to provide a method of measuring PMD of an optical fiber, which can estimate the PMD of the optical fiber after optical cabling, when the optical fiber was wound around a bobbin for transport.",
        "An exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides a method of measuring polarization mode dispersion of an optical fiber, including estimating polarization mode dispersion when an optical fiber is formed as an optical cable, from a beat length when the optical fiber is wound around a bobbin, and an average coupling length when the optical fiber is formed as the optical cable.",
        "According to another exemplary embodiment a method of measuring polarization mode dispersion of an optical fiber, includes measuring the Rayleigh scattered light intensity of the optical fiber by using a polarization-optical time domain reflectometer (P-OTDR).",
        "In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, in a method of measuring polarization mode dispersion of an optical fiber, the resolution of the P-OTDR is made shorter than the shortest beat length estimated for the optical fiber wound around the bobbin.",
        "In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, in a method of measuring polarization mode dispersion of an optical fiber, the optical fiber is wound around the bobbin by setting the radius, R, of the bobbin and a tension at the time of winding the optical fiber around the bobbin, so that the magnitude of birefringence of the optical fiber induced due to winding of the optical fiber around the bobbin becomes smaller than the magnitude of internal birefringence inherently held by the optical fiber.",

        "First, an individual study is provided as to how the beat length LB and the average coupling length LC change, by winding the optical fiber around a bobbin.",
        "LB changes when birefringence is induced, substantially in the radial direction of the bobbin, from the influence of the bending radius, tension, or lateral pressure at the time of winding the optical fiber around the bobbin.",
        "LC changes due to torsion of the optical fiber, or contact of optical fibers with each other, at the time of winding the optical fiber around the bobbin.",
        "Here, the change of LB after the optical fiber is wound around the bobbin is studied from the relationship between the internal birefringence of the optical fiber, and the birefringence of the optical fiber induced from outside.",
        "The direction of birefringence induced from outside by winding the optical fiber around the bobbin, is substantially in the radial direction of the bobbin, while the angle of the birefringent axis inside the optical fiber can take any angle.",
        "Therefore, the average birefringence of the optical fiber when a lateral pressure is applied, can be considered to be an average when the lateral pressure is applied from various angles.",
        "FIG. 1 is a graph showing the results of calculating the magnitude of the average birefringence, at the time of applying a force from outside to two optical fibers having different internal birefringence, to induce birefringence of a different magnitude.",
        "From the results shown in FIG. 1, it is understood that when the magnitude of birefringence induced from outside is smaller than the magnitude of internal birefringence, the magnitude of the average birefringence hardly changes. On the other hand, when the magnitude of birefringence induced from outside is larger than that of the internal birefringence, the magnitude of the average birefringence becomes substantially equal to that of the magnitude of the birefringence induced from outside, and finally, the magnitude of the average birefringence becomes larger than that of the magnitude of the birefringence induced from outside. However, the magnitude of the average birefringence after birefringence is induced from outside due to lateral pressure does not become smaller than that of the internal birefringence. Therefore, by winding the optical fiber around the bobbin, the average LB inevitably becomes shorter, which causes an increase in the PMD.",
        "On the other hand, LC after the optical fiber is wound around the bobbin becomes very short, due to torsion in the optical fiber or due to contact of the optical fibers with each other, when the optical fiber is wound around the bobbin. Therefore, a change in LC due to winding of the optical fiber around the bobbin causes a decrease in the PMD.",
        "Accordingly, when the influence of the change in LC is larger than the influence of the change in LB, the PMD decreases when the optical fiber is wound around the bobbin, and when the optical fiber is formed as an optical fiber cable and put in a free state, the PMD increases, thereby causing a problem.",
        "An exemplary calculation of the PMD is discussed below. For example, when the length of the optical fiber is 1000 m, and this optical fiber is divided into fine sections of 0.1 mm, it is assumed that in the fine sections, the optical fiber has only linear birefringence. A change in the PMD of the optical fiber is calculated by simulation, using the Jones matrix method (refer to IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, September 1992, vol. 4, No. 9, pp. 1066 to 1069).",
        "In a free state, when optical fibers having LB of 10 m and 20 m and LC of 30 m are wound around the bobbin, LC decreases, and birefringence is induced in the radial direction of the bobbin, and from this, how the PMD of the optical fiber changes is calculated.",
        "Both optical fibers are set so that when the optical fibers are wound around the bobbin, LC becomes 3 m. The average coupling length used for the calculation is a typical value such that the optical fiber is put in a free state, and such that the optical fiber is wound around the bobbin. The calculation results of the PMD of the optical fiber are shown in FIG. 2.",
        "From the results shown in FIG. 2, it is understood that when the optical fiber is wound around the bobbin, and when the magnitude of birefringence induced from outside forces is small, the PMD of the optical fiber wound around the bobbin becomes smaller than that of the optical fiber in the free state.",
        "It is also understood that when LB of the optical fibers in the free state is different, the magnitude of the change in the PMD with respect to the magnitude of birefringence induced from outside becomes different. Therefore, when the optical fiber is put in the free state, though the PMD is different, the PMD of both optical fibers may take the same value, according to the magnitude of birefringence induced from outside. If birefringence larger than that is induced, the magnitude correlation of the PMD of the two optical fibers is reversed to that of optical fibers in the free state. That is, the PMD of the optical fiber in the free state cannot be estimated only by measuring the PMD of the optical fiber wound around the bobbin.",
        "Since the optical fiber cable has such a structure that an external force applied to the optical fiber is made as small as possible, the PMD of the optical fiber after optical cabling is substantially the same as that of the optical fiber in the free state. The PMD of the optical fiber after optical cabling cannot be estimated only by measuring the PMD of the optical fiber wound around the bobbin.",
        "However, it has been found that if LB of the optical fiber wound around the bobbin is obtained, LB of the optical fiber after optical cabling does not become shorter than the LB of the optical fiber wound around the bobbin. Therefore, by obtaining LC of the optical fiber after optical cabling, the PMD of the optical fiber after optical cabling can be estimated by using Equation (2), shown again, below.",

        "In the case of an optical fiber having a waveform as shown in FIG. 3, since there are 19 extreme values in a 100 m section, it is understood that LB is 21 m. Thus, by measuring LB of the optical fiber wound around the bobbin by using the P-OTDR, and separately measuring LC of the optical fiber cable in the free state, the PMD of the optical fiber formed as an optical fiber cable can be estimated.",
        "The calculation method of LB is not limited to the use of Equation (5), and other methods may be used.",
        "In Corsi et al. and Wuilpart et al., cited above, LB and LC of the optical fiber to be measured in the free state are measured by using the P-OTDR. In contrast, in the present invention, LB is measured by winding the optical fiber around the bobbin, to estimate the PMD of the optical fiber after optical cabling.",
        "Next the relationship between LB of the optical fiber to be measured, and the resolution of the OTDR used for the measurement of the PMD will be described.",
        "In a single-mode fiber excluding a polarization maintaining fiber, since LB is normally 10 cm or longer, if the resolution of the OTDR is shorter than 10 cm, LB and LC can be measured independently in any single-mode fiber.",
        "In such an application, resolution equal to or shorter than 1 cm can be obtained, for example, by using a technique referred to as photon counting OTDR. Therefore, it can be applied to any single-mode fiber other than the polarization maintaining fiber.",
        "The measurement method of the PMD using the P-OTDR can also be applied to a multi-mode fiber, by using a device which selectively excites and receives only the one mode to be measured.",
        "Next an exemplary optical fiber and method in which the PMD after the optical fiber is formed as an optical fiber cable, can be estimated in a state wherein the optical fiber is wound around the bobbin, will be described.",
        "When the magnitude of birefringence of the optical fiber induced due to winding of the optical fiber around the bobbin is smaller than that of internal birefringence, then as described above, the magnitude of the birefringence of the optical fiber wound around the bobbin is substantially the same as the magnitude of the birefringence of the optical fiber after optical cabling.",
        "Therefore, LB of the optical fiber measured in the state wound around the bobbin is substantially equal to LB of the optical fiber after optical cabling. Accordingly, an optical fiber can be provided, in which the PMD of the optical fiber after optical cabling can be estimated by measuring LC of the optical fiber cable beforehand using the same type of optical fiber.",
        "LC after cabling is mainly determined by the internal birefringence of the optical fiber, and the external force induced due to the structure of the optical fiber cable. In many cases, LC can be assumed to be constant regardless of LB. However, when LB is short, that is, when the internal birefringence of the optical fiber is large, then even if an external force is applied to the optical fiber, polarization mode coupling is hardly induced. Hence, there is a case in which LC cannot be regarded as constant. Even in this case, by obtaining LC as a function of LB, an exemplary method according to the present invention can be applied.",
        "Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. H11-208998, (hereafter, \u201cJP '998\u201d) discloses a method of winding an optical fiber so that the PMD of the optical fiber wound around the bobbin matches with the PMD of the optical fiber in the free state. As described above, however, the PMD of the optical fiber wound around the bobbin changes due to the internal birefringence of the optical fiber in the free state. Therefore, in the method of JP '998, the desired winding method cannot be determined unless the internal birefringence of the optical fiber in the free state is known beforehand. Therefore, when LB is different for each optical fiber, actually used in the manufacturing process, then the effect thereof is smaller than that obtained by the present invention.",

        "After winding the optical fiber around the bobbin, when LB was measured by the P-OTDR, LB was 30 m.

        "When the same optical fiber cable as in the first example was formed by this optical fiber, LC was 85 m. Therefore, it could be estimated that the PMD of the optical fiber after optical cabling was 0.05 ps/\u221akm, when the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin at a tension of 20 gf. Moreover, it could be estimated that the PMD of the optical fiber after optical cabling was 0.1 ps/\u221akm, when the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin at a tension of 70 gf.",

Then when this optical fiber was wound around a bobbin having a diameter of 300 mm at a tension of 20 gf, and LB was measured by using the P-OTDR, it was found that LB was 20 m. Next, when this optical fiber was wound around a bobbin having a diameter of 150 mm at a tension of 70 gf, and LB was measured by using the P-OTDR, it was found that LB was 10 m.",
        "Moreover, when the optical fiber was used to form optical fiber cables, the PMD was measured at 0.06 ps/\u221akm for both cases, which was less than 0.1 ps/\u221akm.",
        "In summary, when the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin having a diameter of 300 mm at a tension of 20 gf, the magnitude of the birefringence induced by winding the optical fiber around the bobbin was smaller than the magnitude of the internal birefringence allowed in the standard for the optical fiber. Therefore it could be confirmed that the PMD standard could be satisfied after optical cabling, in the state where the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin. However, when the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin having a diameter of 150 mm at a tension of 70 gf, it could not be confirmed that the PMD standard could be satisfied after optical cabling, in the state where the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin.",
        "In a sixth example, if the same type of optical fiber cable as in the first example is formed by using the same type of optical fiber as in the first example, since LC of the optical fiber cable is about 85 m, then according to Equation (3), it is found that if LB at the time of winding the optical fiber around the bobbin is longer than 15 m, a PMD equal to or less than 0.1 ps/\u221akm can be achieved, at the time of optical cabling. Here, according to Equations (1) and (6), the radius of the bobbin making LB 15 m is about 0.07 m for a wavelength of 1.55 \u03bcm. To calculate this value, a wavelength of 1.55 \u03bcm, an n=1.444, a p11=0.1486, a p12=0.2959, and a \u03bd=0.186 were used. These values are those of synthetic quartz for a wavelength of 1.55 \u03bcm, and since members constituting the optical fiber are mainly synthetic quartz, these values are appropriate. Moreover, it is assumed that r=62.5\u00d710\u22126 m, and the influence of a fiber coating is considered negligible and hence not accounted for.",
        "Accordingly, when the optical fiber was wound around a bobbin having a radius of 0.07 m or larger, it could be confirmed that the PMD of the optical fiber after optical cabling became equal to or less than 0.1 ps/\u221akm, if LB at that time was equal to or longer than 15 m.",
        "On the other hand, when the optical fiber was wound around a bobbin having a radius smaller than 0.07 m, LB became shorter than 15 m under the influence of birefringence induced by bending. Therefore, in the state where the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin, it could not be confirmed whether the PMD after optical cabling became 0.1 ps/\u221akm or less.",
        "An optical fiber of the same type as that mentioned in Example 1 and having a length of 3000 m was prepared. Then when this optical fiber was wound around a bobbin having a diameter of 300 mm at a tension of 20 gf, and LB was measured by using the P-OTDR, it was found that LB was 20 m.",
        "Next, when this optical fiber was wound around a bobbin having a diameter of 100 mm at a tension of 20 gf, and LB was measured by using the P-OTDR, it was found that LB was 7 m.",
        "Moreover, when the optical fiber was used to form optical fiber cables, the PMD was measured at 0.06 ps/\u221akm in both cases, which was less than 0.1 ps/\u221akm.",
        "In summary, when the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin having a diameter of 300 mm, it could be confirmed that the PMD standard could be satisfied after optical cabling, in the state where the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin, but it could not be confirmed, when the optical fiber was wound around the bobbin having a diameter of 100 mm.",
        "An optical fiber of the same type as that mentioned in the first example and having a length of 10000 m was prepared. When this optical fiber was wound around a bobbin having a diameter of 300 mm at a tension of 100 gf, LB was measured by using the P-OTDR, was found to be 10 m.",
        "The bobbin around which the optical fiber was wound had a structure capable of reducing the tension. Therefore, when the tension was temporarily reduced, to perform the same measurement, it was found that LB was 25 m in a section of from 0 m to 9000 m. However LB was 10 m in a section of from 9000 m to 10000 m.",
        "Moreover, when the optical fiber was cut into ten pieces of 1000 m, and bundled to form an optical fiber cable of ten cores, the PMD of the coated optical fiber formed by using the section of 0 m to 9000 m measured within the range of from 0.03 to 0.06 ps/\u221akm, but in the core line using the section of 9000 to 10000 m, the PMD exceeded 0.1 ps/\u221akm.",
        "In other words, by having a structure capable of temporarily reducing the tension, it could be confirmed whether the PMD standard was satisfied after optical cabling, but when this tension compensating structure was not used, confirmation was not possible. After the measurement, since the tension was returned to that before the measurement, there was no problem in feeding the optical fiber in the subsequent manufacturing process. Moreover, by using the P-OTDR, the PMD in the longitudinal direction of the optical fiber could be measured.",
        "In a seventh example, the beat length required for achieving a PMD equal to or less than 0.1 ps/\u221akm as the whole transmission path, and the beat length required for achieving a PMD equal to or less than 0.1 ps/\u221akm in an individual optical fiber cable, by using combinations of optical fibers and optical fiber cables having various structures was determined. As a result, when optical fibers having a beat length of 15 m or longer after optical cabling were coupled, a PMD equal to or less than 0.1 ps/\u221akm could be achieved as the whole transmission path. Moreover, with regard to an optical fiber having a beat length of 30 m or longer when used to form an optical fiber cable, the PMD was equal to or less than 0.1 ps/\u221akm in all individual optical fibers.",
        "A beat length of the optical fiber in the state wound around the bobbin of 15 m or longer is desirable. Moreover, if the beat length of the optical fiber in the state wound around the bobbin is 30 m or longer, the PMD after optical cabling can be made equal to or less than 0.1 ps/\u221akm, regardless of the type of the optical fiber cable.",
        "Therefore, optical fibers having various birefringence were produced, and wound around a bobbin having a diameter of 300 mm at a tension of 40 gf in a length of 3000 m. Then the relationship between the beat length in the state wound around the bobbin, and the PMD after the optical fiber was used to form an optical fiber cable was measured. The results are shown in FIG. 4. From FIG. 4, clearly shows a relationship between the beat length in the state wound around the bobbin, and the PMD after the optical fiber was used to form an optical fiber cable. The PMD after cabling decreases with increasing beat length in the wound around a bobbin fiber state, and becomes almost independent of this beat length at beat length values greater than 30 m.",
        "The mean value of the PMD after optical cabling of the optical fiber having the beat length of 15 m or longer in the state wound around the bobbin was 0.05 ps/\u221akm.",
        "All the optical fibers having a beat length of 15 m or longer in the state wound around the bobbin were connected after optical cabling to form one transmission path, and the PMD thereof was measured. The PMD of the transmission path was 0.06 ps/\u221akm, which was smaller than 0.1 ps/\u221akm.",
        "Of the optical fibers used in the seventh example, the mean value of the PMD of the optical fibers having a beat length of 30 m or longer in the state wound around the bobbin after optical cabling, was 0.015 ps/\u221akm, and there was no optical fiber cable having a PMD exceeding 0.1 ps/\u221akm.",
        "All the optical fibers having a beat length of 30 m or longer in the state wound around the bobbin were connected after optical cabling to form one transmission path, and the PMD thereof was measured. The PMD of the transmission path was 0.016 ps/\u221akm, which was sufficiently smaller than 0.1 ps/\u221akm.",
        "In a final comparative example, the PMD of the optical fiber used in the seventh example was measured in the state wound around the bobbin, and the relationship between the PMD in the state wound around the bobbin, and the PMD after the optical fiber was used to form an optical fiber cable was measured. The results are shown in FIG. 5. From FIG. 5, a clear relationship cannot be found between the PMD in the state wound around the bobbin, and the PMD after the optical fiber was used to form an optical fiber cable.",
        "The mean value of the PMD after optical cabling of the optical fibers having a PMD equal to or less than 0.1 ps/\u221akm in the state wound around the bobbin was 0.09 ps/\u221akm, which was worse than the results of the seventh example, shown in FIG. 4, and was not sufficiently smaller than 0.1 ps/\u221akm.",
        "All the optical fibers having a PMD equal to or less than 0.1 ps/\u221akm in the state wound around the bobbin were connected after optical cabling to form one transmission path, and the PMD thereof was measured. The PMD of the transmission path was 0.11 ps/\u221akm, which was larger than 0.11 ps/\u221akm",
