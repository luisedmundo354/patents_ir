        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a measurement apparatus that automatically tests the properties of a device under test on polar coordinates.",
        "2. Discussion of the Background Art",
        "A network analyzer is an example of a measurement apparatus having a polar coordinate display function (JP (Kokai) 64[1989]-88,165 (pages 2 and 3, FIG. 1)). Several types of polar coordinates are displayed by network analyzers. There are polar charts, as well as the Smith chart or immitance chart, which are modified polar charts. For example, the Smith chart is used to test the performance of electronic components. An example of testing the performance of electronic components is given below.",
        "In general, testing the performance of electronic components is testing whether or not the measurements plotted on a Smith chart displayed on the screen of a network analyzer are within a circle having a pre-determined radius. The circle for this testing is called the test circle. For instance, electronic components pass the test when the measurement of the return loss thereof is approximately a certain complex impedance value. Today inspectors test the performance of an electronic component by affixing transparent film on which a circle having a pre-determined radius has been drawn on the screen of a network analyzer and confirming macroscopically whether or not the measurements of the electronic component are within that circle.",
        "However, there are large fluctuations in the results of testing by macroscopic observation, and testing errors are readily produced. In particular, the test circle on the film is drawn with lines always of the same thickness and therefore, the measurement results can be hidden by the test circle, and so forth, and the testing error rate rises with points closer to the circle. There is also a problem in that it is difficult to identify a specific sweep point in the measurement results displayed with polar coordinates and therefore, it is difficult to use the test finding in combination with other tests. For instance, when filters are being mass produced and inspected, first the properties in the passband are tested using film on which the test circle has been drawn, and then overall band properties including the passband and the stopband are monitored with the sweep conditions being changed, but testing efficiency is poor. Furthermore, the measurement results of devices under test that require additional outside circuits are displayed away from the origin of the polar coordinates and therefore, when all measurement results are displayed together, the measurement results are observed in small size and this leads to testing errors. In addition, in this case it is difficult to watch the test results or measurement results while adjusting the device under test so that under optimum conditions, the measurement results are within the test circle.",
        "The present invention provides a measurement apparatus with which it is possible to test a device under test on polar coordinates in order to solve the above-mentioned problems. Moreover, an object of the present invention is to provide a measurement apparatus with which it is possible to accurately test a device under test with stability without affecting the test circle. Additionally, the present invention provides a measurement apparatus having a test function that can be easily used in combination with other tests. The present invention also provides a measurement apparatus having a test function that facilitates the examination procedure. Furthermore, the present invention also provides a method and a program that make this apparatus feasible.",
        "By means of the present invention, it is not necessary to draw a test circle on film, testing can be performed without displaying the test circle displayed on polar coordinates, measurement results can be displayed over the test circle when the measurement results are displayed on polar coordinates, and test circles of various shapes can be accurately set up. Moreover, the test range can be set. Therefore, measurements within a wide range that includes the test range can be simultaneously performed. Thus, the testing can be easily used in combination with other testing processes. Furthermore, as long as the difference needed for testing is calculated for all measurements, some of the operating functions of conventional network analyzing apparatuses can be salvaged and a testing function can be added with some modifications.",

When the measurements that have been read are measured outside the test range, processing part 140 controls display part 120 such that points are plotted in the usual color on the polar coordinates using the measurements that have been read. If the measurements that have been read are measured within the test range, processing part 140 further reads the center coordinates housed in memory region 260 and the radius housed in memory region 270.

Processing part 140 refers to the difference that is obtained and the radius that has been read and if the size of the referred difference is no greater than the referred radius, the test is passed. Moreover, the test is also passed if the size of the referred difference is less than the referred radius.

The range of the subject of testing is defined by the sweep range of the reference signals and by the combination of the test start point and the test stop point. Consequently, memory part 130 comprises memory region 230 for storing the test start point, memory region 240 for storing the test end point, memory region 260 for storing the center coordinates, and a memory region 370 for storing the radius. A real number sequence consisting of elements R1 to Rn is stored in memory region 370. n is the number of measurement points and is the number that is obtained by adding the number 1 to the value that is obtained when the width of the sweep range is divided by the sweep interval. n number of radii are housed in each element of the real number sequence. The subscript n of element Rn is the identification number of the element. If the values of the elements of the sequence of memory region 370 are all the same, the test circle is circular.

If the measurements that have been read are measured within the test range, processing part 140 further reads the center coordinates housed in memory region 260. Moreover, processing part 140 subtracts the center coordinates that have been read from the measurements that have been read to obtain the difference. Then processing part 140 reads the radius housed in the elements of the sequence of memory region 370. At this time, the radius is read in relation to the measurements that were read when the difference was obtained. For instance, the radius is read so that the identification number of the element of the sequence of memory region 370 coincides with the identification number of the element of the sequence of memory region 380 that was read when the difference was obtained. Processing part 140 refers to the difference that is obtained and the radius that has been read and if the magnitude of the referred difference is no greater than the referred radius, the test is passed. Moreover, the test is also passed if the magnitude of the referred difference is less than the referred radius. When the test has been passed, processing part 140 controls display part 120 and plots points in the usual color on the polar coordinates using the measured values that have been read. On the other hand, when the test has not been passed, processing part 140 plots in a color that is different from the usual color on the polar coordinates using the measurements that have been read and sets memory region 250 to \u201c1.\u201d It should be noted that memory region 250 is inside memory part 130 and the results of the test are housed in memory part 130. A test result housed in memory region 250 of \u201c0\u201d indicates that the test is passed, and a test result of \u201c1\u201d indicates that the test was not passed. Memory region 250 is initially set at \u201c0.\u201d The above-mentioned processing in step 5a is performed for all measurements. Moreover, interpolation between the points that are plotted is accomplished using straight lines and approximate curves as necessary. In addition, marks can be made in places related to measurements when measurements are displayed on polar coordinates and therefore, the plotted points can be represented by abbreviations, symbols, and so forth.",
        "Finally, in step 6b, network analyzer 100 displays the test results. The same processing as in step 6a is performed in step 6b.",
        "A third embodiment will now be described.",
        "The third embodiment of the present invention is a network analyzer and its structure is shown in FIG. 1. However, the operation of network analyzer 100 of the third embodiment differs from the operation of network analyzer 100 of the first embodiment.",
        "The operating procedure of network analyzer 100 of the third embodiment is described below. As previously explained, network analyzer 100 is operated under the control of processing part 140 that executes programs. Consequently, the following operating procedure describes the flow of the program executed by processing part 140. The flow chart showing the operating procedure of network analyzer 100 here is shown in FIG. 2. Moreover, FIG. 5 shows the memory regions contained in memory part 130. The following description refers to FIGS. 1, 2, and 5.",
        "First, in step 1c, the setting data related to measurement are input. The same processing as in step 1a is performed in step 1c.",
        "Next, in step 2c, the setting data related to testing are input. Network analyzer 100 inputs the range of the subject of testing and the center coordinates and radius for testing a device under test through input part 160 and the input test range, center coordinates, and radius are housed in memory part 130. The range of the subject of testing is defined by the sweep range of the reference signals and by the combination of the test start point and the test stop point. Consequently, memory part 130 comprises a memory region 230 for storing the test start point, a memory region 240 for storing the test end point, a memory region 360 for storing the center coordinates, and a memory region 270 for storing the radius. A complex sequence consisting of components C1 to Cn is stored in memory region 360. n is the number of measurement points and is the number that is obtained by adding the number 1 to the value that is obtained when the width of the sweep range is divided by the sweep interval. n number of center coordinates are housed in each component of the complex sequence. The subscript n of component Cn is the identification number of the component. If the values of the components of the sequence of memory region 360 are all the same, the test circle is circular. The test circle becomes another shape when the values of the components of the sequence of memory region 360 are changed. Moreover, the range of the subject of testing can be defined by the combination of the center of the test range and the width of the test range, and in this case, memory regions 230 and 240 house the center of the test range and the width of the test range rather than the test start point and the test end point. Power is input for the sweep start point, sweep end point, center of the sweep range, sweep amplitude, and sweep interval in the case of power sweep, while frequency is input in the case of frequency sweep. The test start point, test end point, center of the test range, and width of the test range are input as electrical power during power sweeping and as frequency during frequency sweeping. The test start point, test end point, center of the test range, and width of the test range, and the radius of the test circle are real numbers. Moreover, the center coordinates of the test circle are complex numbers.",
        "Next, in step 3c, network analyzer 100 displays the test circle on display part 120. The test circle is drawn as a collection of points Lk represented by the following formula, or as a collection of lines that connect points Lk to one another represented by the following formula.

        "FIG. 7 shows is an example of the display in the first through fourth embodiments. In FIG. 7, a test circle 210 is drawn on polar coordinates 220 based on center coordinates and radius and measurement results 230 are further displayed on the same polar coordinates. However, there are times when it is difficult to display and see test circle 210 and measurement results 230 near the corners of polar coordinates 220 with this type of display form. Therefore, a new display method is proposed. An example of display by the new display method is shown in FIG. 8. By means of the new display method, a test circle 310 and measurement results 330 are drawn on polar coordinates 320 with the center coordinates of test circle 310 serving as the origin. In each of the above-mentioned four embodiments, the test circle should be displayed using the radius and the measurement results should be displayed using the difference calculated for the measurements during testing. By means of this display form, the test circle and measurements are displayed close to the center of the polar coordinates and therefore, the test circle and measurements can be easily enlarged as much as possible and displayed. This enlarged display is very convenient when the device under test is being adjusted as it is being measured so that it will pass the test. Furthermore, when the above-mentioned new display method is used, the following changes should be made to each of the above-mentioned four embodiments. First, in steps 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d, respectively, the test circle is drawn with the origin at R+j0. However, R is the property impedance set in the network analyzer. In this connection, the reflection coefficient at the starting point becomes 0+j0. Moreover, in steps 5a, 5b, 5c, and 5d, respectively, the difference is calculated relating to all of the measurement results, the measurement results are displayed using the difference, and only the measurements that are measured by in the test range are inspected.",
        "Moreover, if the difference relating to all of the measurements is calculated as described above, some of the operating functions of a conventional network analyzing apparatus can be salvaged and a test function can be added with small modifications. For instance, the difference for all of the measurements should be found before steps 5a, 5b, 5c, and 5d, respectively, and the measurements should be tested in steps 5a, 5b, 5c, and 5d, respectively, based on these pre-calculated differences.",
        "Furthermore, testing is performed within the test range in the first through fourth embodiments, but it is also possible to test all measurements. In this case, the process of inputting the test range, and so forth can be omitted.",
        "The operator can easily identify measurement results if the measurement results are displayed written over the test circle in the first through fourth embodiments.",
        "Moreover, the display of the test circle in steps 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d, respectively, and the display of the measurement results in steps 5a, 5b, 5c, and 5d, respectively can be omitted. For instance, there are cases where testing should already be performed in a production line that is fully automated, making display of the test circle and display of the measurement results unnecessary.",
        "Furthermore, the setting data are input through input part 160 in the first through fourth embodiments, but it is not necessary to limit input to this part. The sweep range or sweep interval of the reference signals, the center coordinates or radius of the test circle, the test range, and other setting data can also be input through drive 150 or communications part 170. For instance, setting data can be input by supporting a floptical disk on which setting data have been pre-written in drive 150 and reading the setting data from the floptical disk as necessary. The setting data can also be input from a remote station through communications part 170.",
        "In addition, the first through fourth embodiments are not limited to one sweep range and one sweep interval. Multiple sweep ranges are not necessarily the same or continuous. Multiple sweep intervals are not necessarily the same. For instance, the sweep range and sweep interval can be input into network analyzer 100 so that sweeping is performed at 1 MHz for 1 to 5 MHz, at 100 kHz for 7 to 13 MHz, at 1 MHz for 10 to 20 MHz, and at 5 MHz for 20 to 70 MHz. The first through fourth embodiments will likely be modified in some way when multiple combinations of sweep ranges and sweep intervals are defined as described above. For instance, the embodiments are modified so that the necessary setting data can be input and memory regions inside memory part 130 are added and the appropriate group of the multiple groups of sweep ranges and sweep intervals are referred to during display of the test circle and testing. The necessary modifications will be obvious to persons skilled in the art. It goes without saying that the embodiments are not limited to one test range either.",
        "The number of measurement points and testing interval are closely related in the first through fourth embodiments and therefore, the number of test points can be input and used in place of the sweep interval. This is because the sweep interval can be found by calculation from the sweep range and the number of measurement points in the sweep range in question.",
        "The above-mentioned embodiments and modifications thereof are only embodiments for describing the present invention cited in the scope of patent claims and it will be clear to persons skilled in the art that a variety of changes can be made within the scope of the patent claims."
