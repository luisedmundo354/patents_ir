        "This application claims priority to Swedish patent application 0201911-5 filed 20 Jun. 2002 and is the national phase under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 filed 18 Jun. 2003.",
        "The present invention is concerned with a fault location technique for a section of a power transmission line utilizing measurements of current and voltage made at terminals located at one end of the section of the power line.",
        "Several methods and approaches for fault location in high voltage power transmission systems, and power distribution systems, have been developed and employed. One approach has been to use voltage/current transducers located at terminals located at each of two ends of a section of the power line to be monitored. Inductive current transformers are used to provide a measurement of instantaneous current in a transmission line.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,491 entitled Method and device for locating a fault point on a three-phase transmission line, describes a one-end fault location (FL) algorithm. High accuracy of fault location using a fault locator device at one end of a line is achieved by taking into account the actual distribution of a fault current in the transmission network. This algorithm has been successfully implemented into a product in 1982 and is in operation with single and parallel transmission lines in many countries around the world. However, for certain fault conditions it is difficult to obtain accurate pre-fault quantities, such as pre-fault currents, in order to calculate an estimate for voltage drop across the fault path. Also, a disadvantage of using phase voltages and currents and zero sequence components of currents is that it is relatively difficult using these values to compensate for shunt disadvantage of using phase voltages and currents and zero sequence components of currents is that it is relatively difficult using these values to compensate for shunt capacitance effects. In addition, the fault locator method described is not suitable for single and parallel line sections which have an extra link across the ends of the sections.",
        "The aim of the present invention is to remedy one or more of the above mentioned problems.",
        "This is obtained by a method characterised by claim 1. Specific features of the present invention are characterised by the appending claims.",
        "In one aspect of the invention, a method comprising a new formulation of a one-end fault locator algorithm has been proposed. The uniform description of the transmission network in terms of symmetrical components as well as the generalized models of fault loops and faults have been applied. The resulting advantages include the algorithm can be used for locating faults in typical single and parallel transmission lines, and, in addition, fault location may also be carried out for both single and parallel lines with an extra link between the line ends. Another advantage is that a procedure for calculation of a distance to fault is in the form of a compact quadratic equation with the coefficients dependent on a fault type, acquired measurements and impedance data for the transmission network. Another advantage of the invention is that optimal estimation of the voltage drop across a fault path is applied, which has the result that the pre-fault currents in case of single phase-to-ground faults and phase-to-phase faults are no longer required.",
        "In an embodiment, compensation for shunt capacitances is facilitated by means of the use of the notation of symmetrical components. The distributed long line model of the line has been applied for that. The compensation is performed individually for all the sequences. The currents for particular sequences are compensated for the shunt currents and then the fault loop compensated current is composed. In another embodiment improved accuracy has been obtained by means of an option to measure the source impedance at the remote end instead of using a representative value. The source impedance measured at the remote end may be considered as sent to the fault locator by using a simple communication means.",
        "In another embodiment, a method for one end fault location for parallel lines to locate single phase-to-ground faults is described under a plurality of conditions. In another further embodiment a method is described for one end fault location with standard availability of the measured signals for ground faults including both single phase-to-ground faults and phase-to-phase-to-ground faults.",

        "Voltage drop across the fault path, as shown in the third term in equation (1), is expressed using sequence components of the total fault current. The weighting coefficients aF0, aF1, aF2, can accordingly be determined by taking the boundary conditions for particular fault type. See TABLE 2, Alternative sets of the weighting coefficients for determining a voltage drop across the fault path resistance. Examples of derivation of these coefficients are contained in APPENDIX A2.",
        "There is some freedom for setting the weighting coefficients. It is proposed to utilize this freedom firstly for avoiding zero sequence quantities, since the zero sequence impedance of a line may be considered as an unreliable parameter. This can be accomplished by setting aF0=0 as shown in TABLE 2.",
        "Secondly, the freedom in establishing the weighting coefficients can be utilized for determining the preference for using particular quantities. The negative sequence (TABLE 2, set I) or the positive sequence (TABLE 2, set II) can be preferred as well as possibly both types of the quantities (TABLE 2, set III) can be used for determining the voltage drop across the fault path.",
        "The set I is recommended for further use, thus avoiding the positive sequence, and thus avoiding the pre-fault positive sequence current, for the largest number of faults. Avoiding the pre-fault positive sequence current is highly desirable since sometimes the pre-fault currents\u2014due to certain reasons\u2014can not be recorded or registered, but may be contaminated by one or more the symptoms of the occurring fault. Moreover, the accuracy of recording the pre-fault currents, which are basically lower than the post-fault currents, is not very great. This is so since the A/D converters operate with less accuracy in the low range.",

Coefficients from (9) are determined with the local measurements and the impedance data for the transmission line, the extra link between the line terminals and the equivalent systems at the line terminals. Impedance of the equivalent system at the local substation (Z1sA) can be traced on-line with the local measurements. In contrast, the remote system impedance (Z1sB) is not measurable locally from A.

At the same time the original fault loop voltage, the first term in the model (1), is taken for a distance to fault calculation. As concerns determining the voltage drop across the fault resistance, the third term in (1), it is assumed here, which is a standard practice, that the effect of line capacitances at the location of the fault (point F), may be neglected. This is justified as the impedance of the capacitive branch at that location is much greater than the fault resistance.

The calculated distance to a fault from a particular (say, present iteration) is utilized for determining the shunt current in the next iteration.

        "In the embodiment shown, measuring device 14 for continuous measurement of all the phase currents, and measuring device 11 for measurement of voltages are arranged at one end, station A. Optionally, measuring devices such as 15, 13 may also be arranged at station B but they are not necessary to practise the invention. The measured values such as: the three-phase voltages (VAA) of the faulted line, three-phase voltages (IAA) of the faulted line and zero sequence current (IAB0) from the healthy parallel line (note that zero sequence is not present when the single line only is considered), and a value representative of the source impedance at B, Z1sB as a are all passed to a calculating unit comprised in fault locator 1, filtered such as described in relation to FIGS. 3a, 3b, and stored in memory means. The calculating unit is provided with the calculating algorithms described, and programmed for the processes needed for calculating the distance to fault. Optionally, the source impedance for the remote end, Z1sB may be measured by the remote device RD, 10, and the information sent via a high speed communication means 60 to the fault locator at A. In some applications it will be preferable to use a measured value sent from B instead of a representative value stored at A. It may be seen in FIG. 18 that current measuring means 15 and voltage measuring means 13 at remote end B may provide a RD 10, a fault locator, or any suitable device with measurements to calculate the remote source impedance",
        "The calculating unit of fault locator 1 is provided with pre-fault phase currents and also with known values such as shunt capacitances and the impedances of the line. In respect of the occurrence of a fault, information regarding the type of fault, phase-to-phase, phase-to-ground etc., may be supplied to the calculating unit of the fault locator. When the calculating unit has determined the distance to fault, it is displayed on the device and/or sent to display means which may be remotely located. A printout or fax of the result may also be provided. In addition to signalling the fault distance, the device can produce reports, in which are recorded measured values of the currents of both lines, voltages, type of fault and other measured and/or calculated information associated with a given fault at a distance.",
        "The method and a fault locator device according to any embodiment of the invention may be used to determine distance to a fault on a section of power transmission line. The present invention may also be used to determine a distance to a fault on a section of a power distribution line, or any other line or bus arranged for any of generation, transmission, distribution, control or consumption of electrical power.",
        "The fault locator device and system may comprise filters for filtering the signals, converters for sampling the signals and one or more micro computers. The microprocessor (or processors) comprises a central processing unit CPU performing the steps of the method according to the invention. This is performed with the aid of a computer program, which is stored in the program memory. It is to be understood that the computer program may also be run on one or more general purpose industrial computers or microprocessors instead of a specially adapted computer.",
        "The computer program comprises computer program code elements or software code portions that make the computer perform the method using equations, algorithms, data and calculations previously described. A part of the program may be stored in a processor as above, but also in a ROM, RAM, PROM or EPROM chip or similar. The program in part or in whole may also be stored on, or in, other suitable computer readable medium such as a magnetic disk, CD-ROM or DVD disk, hard disk, magneto-optical memory storage means, in volatile memory, in flash memory, as firmware, or stored on a data server.",
        "A computer program according to the invention may be stored at least in part on different mediums that are computer readable. Archive copies may be stored on standard magnetic disks, hard drives, CD or DVD disks, or magnetic tape. The databases and libraries are stored preferably on one or more local or remote data servers, but the computer program and/or computer program product may, for example at different times, be stored in any of; a volatile Random Access memory (RAM) of a computer or processor, a hard drive, an optical or magneto-optical drive, or in a type of non-volatile memory such as a ROM, PROM, or EPROM device. The computer program may also be arranged in part as a distributed application capable of running on several different computers or computer systems at more or less the same time.",
        "In another preferred embodiment, the fault locator may be used with parallel lines to locate single phase-to-ground faults (a-g, b-g, c-g faults) in case of unavailability of measurements from the healthy parallel line. Two modes of the healthy line operation are taken into account:\n\n    \n    \n        the healthy line being in operation,\n        the healthy line switched-off and grounded at both the ends.",
        "FIG. 19 shows the flow-chart of the algorithm for locating faults in parallel lines under unavailability of measurements from the healthy parallel line. The unavailable, here healthy line zero sequence current, is required for reflecting the mutual coupling effect under single phase-to-ground faults (a-g, b-g, c-g faults). The unavailable current is thus estimated. The other faults can be located with the standard fault location algorithm (such as the algorithm from reference [1]).",
        "The sequence of computations for the presented one-end fault location algorithm is as follows.",
        "As shown in the flowchart in FIG. 19 the following measurements are utilized:\n\n    \n    \n        voltages from the side A and line LA (faulted) from particular phases: vAA\u2014a, vAA\u2014b, vAA\u2014c,\n        currents from the side A and line LA (faulted) from particular phases: iAA\u2014a, iAA\u2014b, iAA\u2014c",
        "The utilized input data are as follows:\n\n    \n    \n        impedances of the faulted line for the positive (Z1LA) and zero (Z0LA) sequences\n        impedance of the healthy line for the zero sequence (Z0LB)\n        zero sequence impedance for the mutual coupling (Z0m)\n        information on the fault type (from the protective relay)\n        mode of the healthy line operation: in operation or switched-off and grounded at both ends).",
        "The measured fault quantities (voltages and currents) undergo adaptive filtering aimed at rejecting the dc components from currents and the transients induced by Capacitive Voltage Transformers (CVTs).",

        "The presented method covers single phase-to ground faults (a-g, b-g, c-g faults). The other remaining faults have to be located with the fault location algorithms described above or standard fault location algorithm [1]. Distance to fault (d) for the considered here single phase-to ground faults is calculated by solving the quadratic formula for a sought distance to fault (26). Equation (26) is the same as equation (10) except that the values for B1,B2,B3 are different to the values determined in (10). The solution gives two roots:",

        "TABLE 2 contains three alternative sets (Set I, Set II, Set III) of the weighting coefficients, which are used for determining a voltage drop across a fault path. The coefficients are calculated from the boundary conditions\u2014relevant for a particular fault type. This is distinctive that in all the sets the zero sequence is omitted (aF0=0). This is advantage since the zero sequence impedance of a line is considered as the uncertain parameter. By setting aF0=0 we limit adverse influence of the uncertainty with respect to the zero sequence impedance data upon the fault location accuracy. To be precise one has to note that this limitation is of course partial since it is related only to determining the voltage drop across a fault path. In contrast, while determining the voltage drop across a faulted line segment the zero sequence impedance of the line is used.",
