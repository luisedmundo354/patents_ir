        "This application is the national phase under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 of PCT International Application No. PCT/JP02/02845 which has an International filing date of Mar. 25, 2002, which designated the United States of America.",
        "The present invention relates to ionic liquids, electrolyte salts for electrical storage devices, liquid electrolytes for electrical storage devices, electrical double-layer capacitors, and secondary batteries.",
        "An ionic compound generally forms crystals in which positively charged cations and negatively charged anions pull electrostatically against each other. When this ionic compound is dissolved in various other liquids, including water, it provides a liquid that carries electricity; that is, an electrolyte solution. Electrolyte solutions obtained by dissolving an ionic compound in an organic solvent are commonly used in, for example, nonaqueous electrolyte batteries and capacitors.",
        "Some ionic compounds, when the temperature is raised, undergo activation of thermal motion to such an extent as to overcome the ionic interactions, causing the compound itself to become liquid and capable of carrying electricity. A salt in such a state is generally referred to as a \u201cmolten salt.\u201d",
        "The chemical species present in the molten salt are all charged cations or anions; no neutral atoms or molecules are present. Therefore, elements which cannot be obtained from an aqueous electrolyte solution because they have too large a reducing or oxidizing power with respect to water, including metals such as alkali metals, aluminum and rare-earth elements, and non-metals such as fluorine, can be electrolyzed in a molten salt and obtained in elemental form. This has become a main industrial application of molten salts.",
        "Some such molten salts maintain a liquid state at room temperature and do not solidify even at very low temperatures. Such molten salts which maintain a liquid state at room temperature or lower are referred to in particular as \u201croom-temperature molten salts\u201d or \u201cionic liquids.\u201d To minimize electrostatic interactions between the cations and anions which make up the ionic liquid, either or both are molecular ions of a substantial size, and are moreover monovalent to minimize the charge and electrostatic interactions.",
        "Research is actively being pursued on applications for such ionic liquids in electrolytic deposition and in electrolytes for batteries and other purposes. However, because ionic liquids generally have a high moisture absorption and are difficult to handle in air, such applications has yet to be fully realized.",
        "In light of the above, the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate reported by Wilkes et al. in 1992 is a remarkable ionic liquid that can be handled even in air. This new ionic liquid led to the synthesis of many ionic liquids which are combinations of numerous alkylimidazolium cations having different side chains with various anions. Although the properties and applications for these ionic liquids are being actively investigated, there exists a desire for the development of various ionic liquids that can be more conveniently produced and are easy to handle.",
        "Nonaqueous liquid electrolyte-type electrical double-layer capacitors can be charged and discharged at a high current, and thus hold considerable promise as energy storage devices for such applications as electrical cars and auxiliary power supplies.",
        "Prior-art nonaqueous liquid electrolyte-type electrical double-layer capacitors are constructed of positive and negative polarizable electrodes made primarily of a carbonaceous material such as activated carbon and a nonaqueous electrolyte solution. The composition of the nonaqueous electrolyte solution is known to have a large influence on the withstand voltage and electrostatic capacitance of the capacitor.",
        "The nonaqueous electrolyte solution is composed of an electrolyte salt and a nonaqueous organic solvent. Studies have been conducted on various combinations of such electrolyte salts and nonaqueous organic solvents.",
        "For example, quaternary ammonium salts (e.g., JP-A 61-32509, JP-A 63-173312, JP-A 10-55717) and quaternary phosphonium salts (e.g., JP-A 62-252927) are commonly used as the electrolyte salt because of their solubility and degree of dissociation in organic solvents, as well as their broad electrochemical stability range. Organic solvents that are commonly used on account of their high dielectric constant, broad electrochemical stability range and high boiling point include ethylene carbonate, diethyl carbonate, propylene carbonate, butylene carbonate, \u03b3-butyrolactone, acetonitrile and sulfolane.",
        "However, in nonaqueous electrolyte-type electrical double-layer capacitors currently in use, the inadequate solubility of electrolyte salts (e.g., quaternary ammonium salts, quaternary phosphonium salts) in organic solvents commonly used for this purpose limits the amount of salt that can be added, resulting in nonaqueous electrolyte solutions of lower ionic conductivity and electrical double-layer capacitors of lower electrostatic capacitance.",
        "Moreover, because the electrolyte salts have a low solubility, they tend to crystallize at low temperatures, compromising the low-temperature characteristics of the electrical double-layer capacitor.",
        "In light of these circumstances, the objects of the invention are to provide ionic liquids which can be easily and efficiently produced, electrolyte salts for electrical storage devices which have excellent solubility in organic solvents for nonaqueous electrolyte solutions and have a low melting point, liquid electrolytes for electrical storage devices which include these electrolyte salts, and also electrical double-layer capacitors and secondary batteries of excellent low-temperature properties which are constructed using such liquid electrolytes.",
        "We have conducted extensive investigations aimed at achieving the above objects, as a result of which we have discovered that some quaternary ammonium salts and quaternary phosphonium salts bearing at least one alkoxyalkyl substituent have low melting points and excellent characteristics as ionic liquids.",
        "Moreover, we have found that, because quaternary ammonium salts and quaternary phosphonium salts bearing at least one alkoxyalkyl substituent have excellent solubility in nonaqueous organic solvents used in electrical storage devices and also have a low melting point, liquid electrolytes prepared using such quaternary salts can be obtained to a higher concentration than previously possible and are less likely to result in deposition of the electrolyte salt at low temperatures. We have also found that electrical double-layer capacitors manufactured using such liquid electrolytes have a high electrostatic capacitance and excellent low-temperature characteristics.",

The quaternary ammonium salts of formulas (3) and (8) below are especially preferred because they enable electrical storage devices having excellent low-temperature characteristics to be obtained.",
        "",
        "A common method for synthesizing the above quaternary ammonium salts is described. First, a tertiary amine is mixed with a compound such as an alkyl halide or a dialkyl sulfate. If necessary, the mixture is heated, giving a quaternary ammonium halide. Reaction under applied pressure, such as in an autoclave, is preferred when using a compound having low reactivity, such as an alkoxyethyl halide or an alkoxymethyl halide.",
        "The resulting quaternary ammonium halide is dissolved in an aqueous solvent such as water and reacted with a reagent that generates the required anionic species, such as tetrafluoroboric acid or tetrafluorophosphoric acid, to effect an anion exchange reaction, thereby yielding the quaternary ammonium salt of the invention.",
        "In one illustrative method for synthesizing quaternary ammonium tetrafluoroborates, a quaternary ammonium halide is dissolved in water, silver oxide is added and a salt exchange reaction is carried out to form the corresponding quaternary ammonium hydroxide. The product is then reacted with tetrafluoroboric acid, yielding the target compound. This method is effective for synthesizing high-purity quaternary ammonium tetrafluoroborates because the silver halide that forms as a result of salt exchange during formation of the quaternary ammonium hydroxide can easily be removed.",
        "Quaternary phosphonium salts can generally be synthesized in much the same way as quaternary ammonium salts. Typically, a tertiary phosphine is mixed with a suitable compound such as an alkyl halide or a dialkyl sulfate. If necessary, the reaction is carried out under the application of heat.",
        "As in the case of quaternary ammonium salts, quaternary phosphonium salts containing various different anions may be prepared by dissolving a quaternary phosphonium halide (a chloride, bromide or iodide) in an aqueous solvent and reacting the dissolved halide with a reagent that generates the required anionic species so as to effect an anion exchange reaction.",
        "To discourage deposition of the electrolyte salt when an electrolyte solution of the salt dissolved in a nonaqueous organic solvent is placed under low-temperature conditions, it is preferable for the electrolyte salt to have a melting point not higher than 25\u00b0 C., and preferably not higher than 15\u00b0 C. An electrolyte salt having a melting point higher than 25\u00b0 C. deposits out of the solvent at low temperatures, and is thus more likely to lower the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte solution and in turn reduce the amount of electricity that can be drawn from the electrical storage device. The melting point is not subject to any lower limit, although a lower melting point is better.",
        "Ionic Liquid",
        "The ionic liquid according to the present invention is characterized by having general formula (1) below and a melting point of up to 50\u00b0 C., and preferably up to 25\u00b0 C.",

        "The ionic liquid may be prepared in the same way as described above for the electrolyte salt.",
        "The ionic liquids of the invention have numerous desirable features. That is, they (1) have a vapor pressure that is either non-existent or very low, (2) are non-flammable or flame-retarding, (3) have ionic conductivity, (4) have a higher decomposition voltage than water, (5) have a broader liquid temperature range than water, (6) can be handled in air, and (7) have a broader potential window than organic ionic liquids known to the prior art. In particular, when an ionic liquid is used in an electrical storage device, if the potential window is narrow, the electrolyte or electrolyte solution may undergo oxidative decomposition or reductive decomposition. Imidazolium-type ionic liquids have a narrow potential window, and so cannot be used in lithium ion secondary battery systems. However, as noted above, the ionic liquids of this invention have a broad potential window, enabling them to be used in lithium ion secondary batteries as well.",
        "Accordingly, the inventive ionic liquids can be advantageously used as novel electrolytes capable of functioning at temperatures below room temperature in the electrodeposition of metals and alloys, in electroplating baths, and in electrochemical devices for storing energy, such as various types of batteries and capacitors.",
        "Most reaction solvents that are widely used in organic synthesis, such as benzene, methylene chloride and ether, are volatile substances having carcinogenicity. Yet, the ionic liquids of this invention have very low volatilities and also lend themselves well to use as repeatedly reusable reaction solvents for organic synthesis. Hence, they are capable of contributing also to the field of \u201cgreen chemistry\u201d which is developing new synthetic processes that are less burdensome on the environment.",

        "Any nonaqueous organic solvent which is capable of dissolving the above-described ionic liquid or electrolyte salt and is stable within the working voltage range for electrical storage devices such as secondary batteries and electrical double-layer capacitors may be used without particular limitation. However, it is preferable for the nonaqueous organic solvent to be one having a large dielectric constant, a broad electrochemical stability range, a broad service temperature range and excellent safety.",
        "Illustrative examples of suitable solvents include acyclic ethers such as dibutyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-ethoxymethoxyethane, methyl diglyme, methyl triglyme, methyl tetraglyme, ethyl glyme, ethyl diglyme, butyl diglyme, and glycol ethers (e.g., ethyl cellosolve, ethyl carbitol, butyl cellosolve, butyl carbitol); cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, 1,3-dioxolane and 4,4-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane; butyrolactones such as \u03b3-butyrolactone, \u03b3-valerolactone, \u03b4-valerolactone, 3-methyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one and 3-ethyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one; and solvents commonly used in electrochemical devices, such as amide solvents (e.g., N-methylformamide, N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone), carbonate solvents (e.g., diethyl carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate, propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, styrene carbonate), and imidazolidinone solvents (e.g., 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone).

        "When the above-described liquid electrolyte is used as a liquid electrolyte for electrical storage devices, in the form described in (1) above it is of course 100% ionic liquid. In above forms (2), (3) and (4), the concentration of ionic liquid or electrolyte salt in the solvent, while not subject to any particular limitation, is generally 0.1 to 5.0 mol/L, and preferably 1.0 to 4.0 mol/L. At a concentration of less than 0.1 mol/L, energy loss may rise due to increased internal resistance. On the other hand, at a concentration higher than 5.0 mol/L, if the electrolyte salt has a low solubility and a relatively high melting point, undesirable effects may arise at low temperatures, such as deposition of the salt and a decline in stability.",
        "Because the electrolyte salts for electrical storage devices of the invention have a better solubility in nonaqueous organic solvents than conventional electrolyte salts and have a melting point no higher than 25\u00b0 C., the electrolyte salt does not readily deposit out of solution at low temperatures even when used at a higher electrolyte salt concentration than is normally the practice.",

        "Of the above, lithium tetrafluoroborate, lithium hexafluorophosphate, sulfonyl methide lithium salts of general formula (12) and general formula (13) are preferred because they are ion-conductive salts having a particularly high ionic conductivity and excellent thermal stability.

        "The method of activation is not subject to any particular limitation. Examples of such techniques that may be used include chemical activation and steam activation. Activated carbon prepared by chemical activation using KOH is preferred because the resulting capacitor tends to have a larger electrostatic capacitance than when steam-activated carbon is used.",
