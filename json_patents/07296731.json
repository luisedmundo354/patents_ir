        "The present invention relates generally to paperboard cartons for use in packaging articles and, more particularly, relates to a dispensing carton with at least one opening for dispensing articles from within the carton.",
        "Cartons are useful for allowing consumers to purchase, transport and store a desired quantity of articles such as soft drinks. For the convenience of the consumer, some cartons have dispensers which allow the articles to be removed one at a time while continuing to encase the remaining articles. A portion of the carton is torn out to form an opening from which articles may be dispensed. There are typically multiple rows of articles, one above the other, carried within the carton. Once the endmost article is removed from the carton through the dispenser, another article moves forward.",
        "There are also larger cartons for multiple tiers of articles, one alongside the other, while each tier has multiple rows of articles, one above the other. These larger cartons are commonly referred to as double stacked cartons.",
        "Although there are multiple types of cartons available, there is not a simple dispenser configuration that may be easily incorporated into most types of cartons as well as permit most types of articles to be easily dispensed. Therefore, there is a need for an improved dispenser that facilitates easy access to the endmost article within many types of cartons. The improved dispenser must be adaptable for use with double stack cartons.",
        "The present invention provides a carton with an improved article dispenser defined by an endless tear line which facilitates easy access to the articles within various types of cartons. The improved article dispenser may be utilized to dispense various types of articles such as elongated bottles. The improved article dispenser is also adaptable for use with double stack cartons.",
        "Generally described, a plurality of panels are connected together to form a tubular body for accumulating a plurality of articles. A pair of end closure structures at least partially close the opposite ends of the tubular body to form the carton. An article dispenser is provided in the carton by a removable portion defined by an endless tear line. The endless tear line is defined by multiple portions. A first portion formed in the top wall of the carton extends between an end edge and a side edge of the top wall. A second portion formed in one of the side walls extends from the side edge of the top wall to an end edge of the side wall. A third portion formed in one of the end closure structures extends between the end edge of the top wall and the end edge of the side wall.",
        "According to one aspect of the present invention, a second article dispenser may be provided by a second removable portion positioned along side the first article dispenser. The second removable portion is defined by a second endless tear line in the carton. The first and second article dispensers of the present invention are particularly useful with double stack cartons.",

In some embodiments, the cartons 10, 12 and 14 are for dispensing articles such as beverage cans or bottles.",
        "Generally described, the cartons 10, 12 and 14 are formed from a foldable sheet material such as a paperboard. Carton 10, shown in FIG. 1, is formed from a paperboard blank 16 shown in FIG. 2. The blank 16 includes at least four primary panels for forming the carton 10. The panels of the blank 16 are a bottom wall 18, a first side wall 20, a second side wall 22, and a top wall 24. The first side wall 20 is divided by fold line 26 to define portions 20a and 20b. The second side wall 22 is divided by fold line 28 to define portions 22a and 22b. The side walls 20 and 22 have fold lines 26 and 28, respectively, so that the side walls 20 and 22 may be only slightly folded to erect the carton 10 as shown in FIGS. 1.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2, the panels of the blank 16 are hingedly connected in series to one another along fold lines 30, 32 and 34. The bottom wall 18 is hingedly connected to the first side wall 20 by fold line 30. The first side wall 20 is then hingedly connected to the top wall 24 by fold line 32. The second side wall 22 is then hingedly connected to the top wall 24 by fold line 34.",
        "Preferably, the width of the top wall 24 is smaller than the width of the bottom wall 18 as shown in FIG. 2. Because the top wall 24 is narrower than the bottom wall 18, the erected carton 10 is somewhat tapered above the fold lines 26, 28 on side walls 20, 22 as best shown in an end view (FIG. 5) of the erected carton 10.",
        "Each of the panels 18, 20, 22 and 24 is provided with opposing end flaps hingedly connected to the respective panel along transverse fold lines 36 and 38. Fold lines 26 and 28 each extend the full width of the blank 16. However, fold lines 36 and 38 preferably do not extend straight all the way along the length of the blank 16. As shown in FIG. 2, the part of the fold line 36 defining one end edge of first side wall 20 includes portions 36a and 36b while the part of the fold line 38 defining the other end edge of first side wall 20 includes portions 38a and 38b. Portions 36a and 38a partially define the opposed end edges of portion 20a of the first side wall 20. Portions 36b and 38b define the opposed end edges of portion 20b of the first side wall 20. The part of the fold line 36 defining one end edge of second side wall 22 includes portions 36c and 36d, and the part of the fold line 38 defining the other end edge of second side wall 22 includes portions 38c and 38d. Portions 36c and 38c define the opposed end edges of portion 22a of the second side wall 22. Portions 36d and 38d partially define the opposed end edges of portion 22b of the second side wall 22.",
        "The bottom wall 18 is provided with opposing bottom end flaps 52 and 54, and the top wall 24 is provided with opposing top end flaps 56 and 58. First side wall 20 is provided with opposing side end flaps 60 and 62. Second side wall 22 is provided with opposing side end flaps 64 and 66. The end flaps 52, 56, 60 and 64 extend outward from the transverse fold line 36. The end flaps 54, 58, 62 and 66 extend outward from the transverse fold line 38.",
        "Still referring to FIG. 2, the end flaps 60, 62, 64, 66 of the first and second side walls 20, 22 include additional fold lines that cooperate with the transverse fold lines 36 and 38 to truncate the vertical corner edges of the carton 10 when erected. Fold line portion 40a is formed in the side end flap portion 60a and extends from one end of fold line portion 36a to a first cut out 41.

        "\u201cReferring further to FIG. 17, the parts of tear line portions 386a and 388a which extend perpendicular to the transverse fold line 242 define a part of the common tear line portion. The parts of the tear line sub-portions 386c and 388c of blank 310 which extend perpendicular to the transverse fold line 242 define the other part of the common tear line portion. Staled differently, only the upper vertical arm portion of each of the L-shaped tear line sub-portions 386c and 388c define the other part of the common tear line portion because the sub-portions 386c, 388c do not extend entirely across the top end flap 254. The lower distal end of the top end flap 254 is offset from the sub-portions 386d, 388d when viewed from the end of the carton 15.\u201d",
        "\u201cAlso, as best shown in FIG. 18, the lower horizontal arm portions of the sub-portions 386c and 388c together define a single horizontal tear line that is displaced from the distal or lower end of end flap 254. The horizontal tear line terminates at opposite side edges of the top end flap 254. As best shown in FIG. 19, a distal portion of the end flap 254 below\u201dthe horizontal tear line remains attached to the carton 15 after the removable portion 284 is completely removed from the carton 15. This distal portion of the end flap 254 is partially obscured from view in FIG. 19 behind the folded end flaps 258, 262, and remains attached to the carton 15 even after removal of removable portion 282.",
        "\u201cAs best shown in FIG. 17, the lower horizontal arm portions of the sub-portions 386c and 388c are aligned and continuous with the sub-portions 386d, 388d respectively when the carton is erected. Further, the lower horizontal arm portions of sub-portions 386c and 388c that defines the single horizontal tear line interconnect the sub-portions 386d and 388d when the carton 15 is erected.\u201d",
        "\u201cIn the third embodiment described above, the distal ends of the sub-portions 286d and 288d are offset from the lower edge of the top end flap 254 when viewed from the respective end of the carton (see FIG. 12). However, the elevation of either the sub-portions 286d and 288d or the lower edge of the top end panel 254 may be adjusted such that the sub-portions 286d and 288d are aligned with the lower edge of the top end flap 254. FIG. 20 illustrates such a modified form wherein the sub-portions 486d and 488d are aliszned with the lower edge of the top end flap 254.\u201d",
        "It will be recognised that as used herein, directional references such as \u201ctop\u201d, \u201cbottom\u201d, \u201cupper\u201d, \u201clower\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, \u201cleft\u201d, \u201cend\u201d, and \u201cside\u201d do not limit the respective walls or panels to such orientation, but merely serve to distinguish these panels from one another. Any reference to hinged connection should not be construed as necessarily referring to a single fold line only: indeed it is envisaged that hinged connection can be formed from one or more of one of the following, a perforation, a score line, a frangible line or a fold line, without departing from the scope of invention.",
        "The present invention has been illustrated in relation to a particular embodiment which is intended in all respects to be illustrative rather than restrictive. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention is capable of many modifications and variations without departing from the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention is described by the claims appended hereto and supported by the foregoing."
