        "Today's work machines are employed in a number of machines used in industries such as manufacturing, mining, construction, and/or agriculture. These work machines generate a large amount of energy for performing a variety of tasks. Most work machines include a power source such as, for example, a diesel engine, a gasoline engine, a natural gas engine, or another appropriate power source that provides energy to complete a task. In certain work machines, the-power source is coupled to a motor that drives one or more mechanical devices that may perform a particular function associated with the power system.",
        "Typically, these motors are operated under peak loading conditions for extended periods of time and, often, in extremely harsh environments. While these motors may be capable of operating under demanding conditions, the strain of continuous operation at peak loading can lead to damage to various components of the motor. For example, a sustained overload condition, if not properly monitored and/or controlled, may cause overheating of the conductive windings of the motor that could lead to permanent conductor damage and/or failure of the motor.",
        "These motors may be protected from potential damage by monitoring and regulating the operation of the motor. One system, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,194,178 issued to Dumbeck (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe '178 patent\u201d) on Mar. 18, 1980, has been developed to monitor the load on a motor by measuring the shaft rotation of the motor and wirelessly transmitting the monitored data over the power windings of the motor by inducing an RF signal onto the power windings. The system of the '178 patent includes a detector and slip analysis circuit mounted within the motor housing, a modulator, and transmitter mounted within the motor housing that impress a modulated motor load signal of radio frequency onto the line that supplies power to the motor. A receiver outside the motor receives the modulated signal, and a demodulator transforms the received signal to produce the motor load signal. The system of the '178 patent also includes a corrective means to correct the motor load signal for variations caused by power line voltage fluctuations.",
        "Although the system of the '178 patent may be capable of monitoring the operation of the motor over the power lines, this system may be unreliable. For example, because the monitoring system relies on current induction and indirect coupling methods for data transfer to wirelessly transmit data, as opposed to using direct electrical connections, the RF signals transferred over the power lines may be susceptible to electromagnetic interference, both internal and external to the motor. This interference may corrupt the monitored data, potentially resulting in unreadable or erroneous motor data.",
        "Furthermore, the system of the '178 patent does not provide a continuous electrical connection capable of providing power to operate the motor. For example, because an induction method is used to wirelessly transfer the RF signals over the motor power windings, the system of the '178 patent is limited to output powers less than 100 milliwatts, which may be too low to energize the field windings of the motor enough to provide mechanical motion of the rotor.",
        "In addition, because the system of the '178 patent does not provide a direct electrical connection to the motor, additional wiring harnesses and control systems are still required to operate the motor, which could substantially increase the manufacturing and production costs of the motor. Moreover, the inclusion of power wiring within the motor housing increases the risk of noise for the RF data monitoring link, which may result in further degradation of the RF signal quality and reliability.",
        "The presently disclosed integrated motor monitoring system and method are directed toward overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above.",
        "In accordance with one aspect, the present disclosure is directed toward an integrated motor monitoring system.

The method may also include monitoring a current of at least one of the plurality of field conductors. The method may further include enabling data communication over the at least one of the plurality of field conductors, based on the monitored current.",

For example, switches 28 may be collectively commanded by controller 16 to operate in a particular sequence.

        "The disclosed integrated motor monitoring system may be applicable to any system where an integrated, compact, and reliable motor control system may be advantageous. More specifically, the disclosed integrated electric control system may provide an integrated monitoring and control system for a motor for providing data monitoring signals over power wiring. The operation of integrated motor monitoring system 13 will now be described.",
        "As illustrated in flowchart 50 of FIG. 4, operation of integrated motor monitoring system 13 is initiated when a power signal is applied to motor 15 (Step 51) by controller 16. Controller 16 may receive a power signal from power source 11 and energize field conductors 21 of motor 15. For example, one or more switches 28 associated with controller 16 may be sequentially operated to selectively provide power signals in the form of current flow through one or more field conductors 21. The sequencing of operation of switches 28 provides different current flow through each of field conductors 21, generating a varying electromagnetic field. This varying electromagnetic field acts upon rotor 19 to generate angular velocity to provide torque output. The sequencing of the operation of switches 28 may be precisely coordinated by controller 16 in order to provide maximum operational control of the operational characteristics of motor 15.",
        "Upon start-up of motor 15, the current supplied to the field conductors over transmission lines 32 may be monitored (Step 52). A current monitoring device may be associated with each field conductor to measure the current in each of field conductors 21. For example, controller 16 may include an ammeter (not shown) electrically coupled to transmission lines 32 to monitor the current through each of transmission lines 32. Because switches 28 may be configured to selectively enable current flow through each of the field conductors 21, the instantaneous current on each of the field conductors 21 may be substantially different. Current data may be provided to controller 16 and monitored by CPU 23.",
        "Each current monitoring device may continuously monitor the current in a field conductor until the current in one or more field conductors 21 is substantially negligible, which may be pre-designated as an \u201coff\u201d state (Step 53). Controller 16 may receive data associated with the current levels of each of field conductors 21 and may determine if the current is below a predetermined threshold, based on historical and/or predetermined specification data associated with motor 15.",
        "If the monitored current of one or more field conductors 21 drops below the predetermined threshold amount, a query may be sent to one or more monitoring devices 17, and data may be received from the monitoring devices 17 in response to the query (Step 54). The received data may be stored in computer readable memory 24, analyzed by CPU 23 to determine the status of the operation of motor 15, and/or used to modify the operation of motor 15. Upon receipt of the data from monitoring devices 17, current monitoring devices may continue to monitor current through one or more field conductors 21.",
        "Controller 16 may receive data information indicative of an operation of motor 15 and may modulate the received data information for transmission over power wire 22 (Step 55). For example, a plurality of data signals may be received by controller 16. As a result, controller 16 may modulate the data using a variety of methods to distinguish each signal from the other during transmission over power wire 22. Furthermore, controller 16 may modulate data signals to efficiently and reliably transfer data signals over power wire 22 in the presence of power signals on power wire 22, using one or more modulation techniques such as, for example, frequency modulation, amplitude modulation, pulse-tone modulation, phase modulation, or any other appropriate modulation technique. In addition to modulation, the signals may be multiplexed so that a plurality of modulated signals may be integrated into a single signal. This integration may allow a large amount of information to be arranged to allow faster signal transmission, thereby reducing the opportunity for data collusions, attenuation, and interference during transmission over power wire 22.",
        "Data signals may be transferred to electronic control unit 12 over power wire 22 (Step 56). For example, once data signals have been appropriately modulated and formatted for transmission, controller 16 may transmit the data to electronic control unit 12 over power wire 22. Because data signals have been modulated and/or formatted, interference between data signals and power signals may be reduced.",
        "An alternative series of method steps for operating integrated motor monitoring system 13 is illustrated by steps 62-65 of flowchart 50 of FIG. 4. Controller 16 may be configured to monitor the switch sequence of electric drive 27 (Step 62) and calculate a switch timing associated with the energizing of field conductors 21 (Step 63). For example, switches 28 associated with electric drive 27 may operate based on current supplied to the field windings to achieve a desired output torque of motor 15. To maintain the desired output torque, the specific sequence of switching may be calculated by controller 16.",
        "During an \u201coff\u201d state of one or more switches 28, controller 16 may determine a sensor switch timing (Step 64) to operate one or more sensor switches 26 to provide a selective data flow path over the one or more field conductors 21 (Step 65). Sensor switches 26 may communicatively couple an array of monitoring devices 17 to controller 16 via field conductors 21. When a field conductor 21 is not energized, data communication is provided over a data flow path between monitoring devices 17 and controller 16 by operating one or more sensor switches 26. Upon operating the sensor switch, integrated motor monitoring system 13 may continue in sequence with Step 54, as previously described.",
        "Because controller 16 may be included within the motor housing and may be configured to receive data information over motor conductors, integrated electric motor control system 13 may substantially reduce manufacturing costs. For example, monitor and control systems in a single unit may benefit from the use of shared resources such as, for example, CPU, memory, RAM, communication electronics, etc. Moreover, costs associated with providing multiple units, each containing dedicated components, may be minimized. Furthermore, because data information may be transmitted using existing power wiring, manufacturing, maintenance, and replacement costs of wires, connectors, and wiring harnesses may also be reduced.",
        "In addition, by combining motor control and monitoring functions in a single unit system, complexity may be reduced, minimizing system downtime and increasing productivity. For example, separate units may require maintenance and repair at different times, essentially increasing the likelihood of extended periods of equipment unproductiveness. However, by integrating the monitor and control functions in a single, compact unit the entire unit may be repaired or replaced simultaneously, which may decrease maintenance and/or repair down-times.",
        "Integrated motor monitoring system 13 may increase motor reliability by providing motor control capability based on monitored data. For example, because motor monitoring functions are implemented by controller 16, operation and/or regulation of motor 15 may be controlled based upon the monitored characteristics of motor operation. As a result, operational aspects of motor 15 such as, for example, motor speed, torque output, field conductor current, or other operational aspects may be controlled based on operational characteristics of motor 15 such as temperature, vibration, acoustic noise, or field conductor overload. In the event of a fault condition, integrated motor monitoring system 13 may respond faster than conventional monitoring units having separate control units, which may reduce the potential for damage resulting from a fault condition.",
        "It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the disclosed integrated motor monitoring system without departing from the scope of the invention. Other embodiments of the present disclosure will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the present disclosure. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope of the present disclosure being indicated by the following claims and their equivalents."
