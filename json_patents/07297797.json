Examples of such traits are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such traits are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects, arachnids, nematodes and worms by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CryIA(a), CryIA(b), CryIA(c), CryIIA, CryIIIA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CryIF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as \u201cBt plants\u201d). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexius, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the \u201cPAT\u201d gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of \u201cBt plants\u201d which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD\u00ae (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut\u00ae (for example maize), StarLink\u00ae (for example maize), Bollgard\u00ae (cotton), Nucotn\u00ae (cotton) and NewLeaf\u00ae (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready\u00ae (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link\u00ae (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI\u00ae (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS\u00ae (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield\u00ae (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.",
