No. 7,193,387 B1, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "The present invention relates generally to electric induction motors and more particularly to estimating motor speed using hybrid model reference adaptive systems.",
        "Motor control systems are widely used to control various aspects of motor performance in a broad spectrum of applications in which electric motors drive loads. Induction motors are asynchronous AC motors having a stator with stator windings providing a rotating AC stator field, with a rotor attached to the motor shaft to rotate within the stator field. Induction motors generally include a so-called squirrel cage rotor with the rotor rotating at a speed less than the rotational speed of the rotating stator field. The rotation of the stator magnetic field induces a current in the rotor conductors, in turn creating a rotor magnetic field that causes the rotor to turn in the direction the stator field is rotating. For many electric motor applications, control of the motor speed is important, particularly where the shaft load varies. In this regard, speed control during startup is particularly important in many motor control applications.",
        "To regulate the motor performance according to a desired speed, it is necessary to measure or estimate the actual rotational speed of the rotor at any given time. In certain induction motor control architectures, moreover, soft-starters are used to energize the stator windings during startup, with the soft startup controls being bypassed once the motor reaches the normal operating speed, in order to minimize steady state heat generation. Many conventional motor control systems employ some form of tachometer or other sensor device mechanically coupled to the motor shaft to produce a feedback signal representing the motor speed, to facilitate closed loop startup speed control. However, such external sensors add cost to the motor drive system, and require maintenance.",
        "Sensorless systems have been proposed and introduced, often employing model-based estimation or speed estimation based on measuring stator current harmonic content. However, actual motor startup times using these systems often varies with line voltage and motor load, which makes it difficult to coordinate motor startup with other equipment in various automated systems. Model-based approaches in particular suffer from variance in motor parameters and weak signals during motor startup. Stator-current-harmonics-based approaches require complex signal processing and the measured harmonics are related to the rotor structure, whereby the speed estimate cannot be updated quickly. Thus, there is a continuing need for improved motor controls and sensorless speed estimation techniques and systems for motor control applications, particularly for controlling motor speeds during startup.",
        "One or more aspects of the invention are now summarized to facilitate a basic understanding of the invention, wherein this summary is not an extensive overview of the invention, and is intended neither to identify certain elements of the invention, nor to delineate the scope thereof. The primary purpose of the summary, rather, is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form prior to the more detailed description that is presented hereinafter. The present invention involves hybrid Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS)-based speed estimation and motor control techniques that are particularly useful in controlling AC induction motor speed during startup without the need for tachometers or other speed sensors. The invention employs a torque-based MRAS error term over a first speed range, such as from zero to about 80% of full speed, and then a rotor-flux-based MRAS error term for a second speed range, wherein the hybrid MRAS components and closed loop controller are used in providing an estimated speed that is compared with a threshold to determine when the speed estimation switches from torque to flux-based MRAS. In certain embodiments, one of the MRAS error terms is provided to a regulating speed estimate controller, such as a proportional-integral (PI) controller, where the speed estimate controller generates the speed estimate with at least one speed estimate controller gain factor (e.g., KI and/or KP) being adjusted inversely with respect to the stator or rotor flux modulus, wherein the hybrid MRAS technique is less sensitive to motor parameter inaccuracy or variations compared with previous sensorless motor startup approaches, while retaining the cost and maintenance advantages of sensorless control.",

        "Referring now to the figures, several embodiments or implementations of the present invention are hereinafter described in conjunction with the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout, the invention is hereinafter illustrated and described in the context of startup control for a three-phase induction motor, although the invention is not limited to the illustrated examples and can be employed in controlling AC motors of any number of phases. The embodiments illustrated below employ closed-loop control of motor speed during startup, in which an error value used by a regulating controller is obtained using a torque-based MRAS component for a first range of speeds, and then the error is obtained for a second speed rage using a rotor flux-based MRAS component, thereby providing hybrid MRAS speed estimation and control. The inventors have found that the hybrid MRAS approach can be easily implemented in existing motor control apparatus, including soft starters and other motor control devices, and may facilitate uniform speed tracking performance throughout a motor startup process wherein certain motor control drives can be upgraded to implement various features of the invention by software updates in order to implement the hybrid MRAS concepts illustrated and described herein. For instance, where the stator resistance is known or can be measured, the hybrid MRAS systems can be implemented to yield good speed estimation and control performance to facilitate linear ramp control or any other form of desired speed control profile desired by a user.",
        "While not wishing to be tied to any particular theory, the inventors take advantage of the fact that the flux linkages of a motor can be calculated from a set of stator equations and a set of rotor equations, as shown in FIGS. 5B and 5C below, wherein the stator equations do not involve motor speed and can thus be regarded as a reference model. The rotor equations, however, include speed and are thus used as an adjustable model, where the motor speed (e.g., rotor speed) is a parameter in the adjustable model. Moreover, the inventors have appreciated that the estimated torque changes proportionally with the speed estimation error throughout a significant major portion of the startup process, i.e., over a first speed range, wherein a torque-based MRAS component can be successfully used to provide a closed loop control/estimation error term in this first range of speeds. However, the inventors have further found that this relationship does not hold for higher speeds (e.g., in a second speed range), wherein the speed estimation error has almost no impact on rotor flux estimation until the motor speed is in this second (higher) range. The invention uses these discoveries in providing control based on the torque MRAS for low speeds and then using flux-based MRAS components to generate the error term in a second higher speed range, which can be used in motor startup control for implementing any desired speed control profile or operating mode, including but not limited to current limiting mode, soft start mode, current limit with kickstart mode, soft start with kickstart mode, etc., for both no load and loaded operation. The exemplary hybrid MRAS techniques illustrated and described below employ a threshold speed value defining the boundary between the first and second speed ranges, where any suitable threshold value may be used. In one example, the threshold may be set at about 80% of the motor's full speed, with torque-based MRAS being used for 0 to about 80% of rated speed, and rotor-flux-based MRAS being employed for the second 80%\u02dc100% speed range, where the estimated speed is used for switching between the two control ranges.",
        "In these examples, moreover, the adaptive regulator or controller gain is auto-adjusted to be inversely proportional to the square of the stator or rotor flux modulus. In the illustrated examples below, leakage inductance is removed from the reference model in the torque-based stage, where the calculated torque is essentially accurate since stator resistance RS is the only motor parameter in the reference model, and Rs has been found to be fairly constant during the startup process. The stator equations yield the stator flux term \u03c8S and the proportional and integral gains KP and KI of a PI type controller are adjusted based on the reciprocal of the square of the stator flux 1/|\u03c8S|2 (or based on the reciprocal of the square of the rotor flux 1/|\u03c8r|2) such that the adjustment of the controller gains is essentially free of motor parameter variations since its calculation involves only stator resistance Rs, which can be considered constant during startup, where RS can be measured or estimated using any suitable techniques in constructing the stator equations. In the rotor-flux-based control range, the motor is approaching full speed, wherein the remaining motor parameters approach normal values, by which the speed estimation provides an accurate speed value until well after the motor transitions into steady-state operation.",
        "FIGS. 1 and 2 show an exemplary motor drive system 2 for driving a polyphase induction motor 4 using power from a three phase AC power source 6. The system 2 includes a switching system 10 with three pairs of SCR switching devices 10a, 10b, 10c coupled between power supply lines A, B, and C of the AC power source 6 and leads R, S, and T of the motor 4, respectively, with the individual switching devices operating to selectively couple a corresponding motor lead to the AC power source according to a corresponding switch control signal 22.

The switch control circuit 24 provides appropriate switching signals 22 to operate the motor 4 in accordance with the motor control output 25a, which may include pulse width modulation or other switch timing control.",
        "The hybrid MRAS speed estimation system 20a includes a PI controller 26 providing the speed estimate \u03c9\u2032r in radians per second, revolutions per minute, or other suitable units, which is indicative of the speed of the motor 4 at any given time. In this regard, the speed estimation may be performed at a rather high sampling rate such as every 100 us in one example, whereas the speed control of motor controller 25 may in certain embodiments be carried out at a slower rate, such as every 50 ms. The PI controller 26 in the speed estimation system 20a provides the speed estimate \u03c9\u2032r during startup and thereafter according to a controller error input e. The speed estimation system 20a also includes a hybrid model reference adaptive system (MRAS) component 38 with a torque-based MRAS component 34 providing a first error term \u03b51 representing the difference or error between a calculated torque value 34b (torque T in FIG. 2), and an estimated torque value 34a (T\u2032 in FIG. 2).

Any threshold TH1 42 can be used, for example, about 80% of the rated full speed of the motor 4 in one embodiment.",
        "The speed estimate controller 26 operates in generally continuous fashion to provide the motor speed estimate \u03c9\u2032r, with the switching system 10 providing feedback current and voltage values 18 from the motor drive process to the control system 20, such as phase or line voltages, stator current values, etc. The speed estimation system 20a includes stator equations 32 and rotor equations 30, as well as known or estimated values (e.g., resistances, inductances, number of poles P, etc.) for computing calculated and estimated flux and torque values using the current and voltage feedback 18 as inputs, where the calculated and estimated flux values \u03c8 may also be represented in the d-q frame format. As shown in FIG. 1, the rotor speed estimate \u03c9\u2032r is provided by the PI speed estimate controller 26 to the rotor equations 30, and also to the motor controller 25 and the bypass control component 14, which selectively provides the bypass control signal 16 to bypass the switching system 10 when the rotor speed estimate \u03c9\u2032r is greater than a second threshold TH2 14a. As best shown in FIG. 2, moreover, the solutions X to the stator equations 30 (e.g., calculated rotor flux values \u03c8rd, \u03c8rq) are provided as inputs to the torque-based MRAS component 34 and to the rotor-flux based MRAS component 36. In addition, the reciprocal of the square of the stator flux modulus 1/|\u03c8S|2 (e.g., or the reciprocal of the square of the rotor flux modulus 1/|\u03c8r|2) is provided from the stator equations 32 to the speed estimate controller 26 for adjustment of the PI controller gains KI and KP.",
        "In operation, the speed estimation system 20a in the motor startup control system 20 evaluates the stator equations 32 to derive a calculated rotor flux 36b (\u03c8rd, \u03c8rq in the d-q reference frame, as shown best in FIG. 2) according to the current and voltage feedback values 18, and evaluates the rotor equations 30 to derive an estimated rotor flux 36a (\u03c8\u2032rd, \u03c8\u2032rq) according to the feedback values 18 and according to the rotor speed estimate \u03c9\u2032r. The system 20a also computes either the stator flux modulus |\u03c8S|2 or the rotor flux modulus |\u03c8r|2. The torque-based MRAS component 34, in turn computes a calculated torque value T according to the calculated rotor flux 36b (\u03c8rd, \u03c8rq) and computes an estimated torque value T\u2032 according to the estimated rotor flux 36a (\u03c8\u2032rd, \u03c8\u2032rq). The torque-based MRAS component 34 then provides the first error term \u03b51 as the difference between the calculated and estimated torque values 36b and 36a, respectively (\u03b51=T\u2212T\u2032). The rotor flux-based MRAS component 36 provides the second error term \u03b52 as a vector product of the calculated rotor flux 36b (\u03c8rd, \u03c8rq) and the estimated rotor flux 36a (\u03c8\u2032rd, \u03c8\u2032rq).",
        "Referring also to FIG. 3, a plot 52 is provided in a graph 50 showing motor speed \u03c9\u2032r vs. time t, wherein the system 2 provides for torque MRAS based speed estimation and speed control using the first error term \u03b51 in a first speed range 54 from zero to a first threshold speed value TH1 (threshold 42 in FIGS. 1 and 2). When the estimated speed \u03c9\u2032r exceeds the threshold TH1 in a second speed range 56, the speed estimate controller 26 uses the second error term \u03b52 (rotor flux-based MRAS control) until the speed \u03c9\u2032r exceeds the second (bypass) threshold TH2 (TH2 14a in FIG. 1), at which time the bypass control 14 provides the bypass control signal 16 to activate bypass switches 12a-12c, wherein the bypass threshold TH2 is typically above the first threshold TH1, and preferably near the full speed FS rating for the motor 4. The control system 20 can be employed for dual range control and/or speed estimation techniques using a hybrid MRAS approach to achieve a substantially uniform speed tracking performance throughout the startup speed range without the need for external tachometers or other sensors, and without suffering from noise associated with conventional harmonic measurement estimation techniques. Thus, the system 20 facilitates advanced sensorless control of startup speed profile in soft starters and other motor control applications.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 4-5C, the motor control and speed estimation aspects of the hybrid MRAS approach are further illustrated in a flow diagram 70 in FIG. 4 showing an exemplary method for motor startup control and speed estimation using a first error term \u03b51 from a torque-based MRAS system (e.g., 34 above) in a first speed range (range 54 in FIG. 3) and using a second error term \u03b52 from a rotor-flux-based MRAS (36) in a second speed range (56). Although illustrated as a single flow, it will be appreciated that the speed estimation and motor control loops can be processed separately at different update rates, for instance, wherein the speed control loop will typically be processed at a lower rate than the speed estimation loop. Moreover, the hybrid MRAS-based speed estimation process can continue operating even after the startup process is complete (e.g., during bypass operation), in order to provide sensorless speed value feedback for steady state motor control or data acquisition. The process 70 begins at 72, in which the rotor speed is estimated using a first error term \u03b51 from a torque-based MRAS system (MRAS 34), and the motor phase switches (e.g., switches 10a, 10b, and 10c in FIG. 1) are controlled at 74 according to the desired motor startup speed profile (speed profile 28 in FIG. 1) and the speed estimate \u03c9\u2032r. A determination is made at 76 as to whether the estimated rotor speed \u03c9\u2032r is greater than the threshold TH1 (e.g., greater than about 80% of rated speed in one example). If not (NO at 76), the method 70 returns to 74 to continue motor control and torque-based MRAS speed estimation according to error term \u03b51. Once the speed \u03c9\u2032r exceeds TH1 (YES at 76), the second speed range (e.g., range 56 in FIG. 3) is entered, and the startup process continues to 78 in FIG. 4, where the rotor speed \u03c9\u2032r is estimated using a second error term \u03b52 from a rotor flux-based MRAS system (MRAS 36) and the motor switching is controlled according to the desired speed profile and the speed estimate \u03c9\u2032r. The speed estimate \u03c9\u2032r is compared to a second (e.g., bypass) threshold TH2 at 80 (e.g., bypass threshold 14a in FIG. 1), and if the speed is still in the second range (NO at 80), the method 70 returns to 78 to continue rotor flux-based MRAS speed estimation according to error term \u03b52 and corresponding motor speed control. When the speed estimate \u03c9\u2032r exceeds TH2 (YES at 80), the startup control switches are bypassed at 82 and the motor leads are connected to the power leads (e.g., bypassed) to complete the motor startup process 70 at 84.",
        "FIGS. 5A-5C illustrate an example of the speed estimate update operation 100 using a hybrid torque and flux-based MRAS system 20a. The speed estimate update process 100 begins at 102, wherein the most recent current and voltage feedback values are obtained at 104 for use at 106 and 108 in evaluating or solving stator and rotor equations (e.g., equations 32 and 30 in the controller 20 of FIG. 1 above). At 106, the stator equations are evaluated using the feedback values to obtain calculated rotor flux and torque values \u03c8rd, \u03c8rq 36b and T 34b, respectively. As best shown in FIG. 5B, the stator equations 32 are evaluated at 106a using the feedback values 18 for the motor terminal voltages VD, VQ and stator currents ID, IQ as well as the mutual inductance Lm, the rotor and stator inductances Lr and Ls, and the stator resistance Rs, to obtain the calculated rotor flux value \u03c8rd, \u03c8rq, where the values for Lm, Lr, Ls, and Rs can be measured values or may be estimated or otherwise specified based on the particular motor 4 being controlled. The torque-based MRAS component 34 then computes the calculated torque value T 34b at 106b based on the calculated rotor flux values \u03c8rd, \u03c8rq 36b, the feedback values 18, and the stator resistance RS. Referring back to FIG. 5A, the rotor equations 30 are evaluated at 108 using the current feedback values 18 and the most recent rotor speed estimate \u03c9\u2032r to obtain estimated rotor flux and torque values 36a and 34a (\u03c8\u2032rd, \u03c8\u2032rq, and T\u2032 in FIG. 1). As best shown in FIG. 5C, the rotor equations 30 employ the feedback values 18 (ID, and IQ) along with the speed estimate \u03c9\u2032r and the motor parameters Lm, Lr, and Rr at 108a from which the flux values 36a \u03c8\u2032rd, \u03c8\u2032rq can be computed. At 108b, the torque-based MRAS component 34 then computes the estimated torque value T\u2032 using the motor parameters Lm, Lr, and the estimated rotor flux values 36a \u03c8\u2032rd, \u03c8\u2032rq.",
        "Referring again to FIG. 5A, once the calculated and estimated flux and torque values have been obtained from evaluation of the stator and rotor equations 32 and 30 at 106 and 108, respectively, the speed estimate update process 100 continues at 110, where the first error term \u03b51 is computed (e.g., by the torque-based MRAS component 34) from the calculated and estimated torque values T 34b and T\u2032 34a, respectively, wherein \u03b51 is computed as T\u2212T\u2032 in the illustrated embodiment. At 112, the second error term \u03b52 is computed (e.g., by the flux-based MRAS component 36) from the calculated and estimated rotor flux values \u03c8rd, \u03c8rq 36b and \u03c8\u2032rd, \u03c8\u2032rq 36a, respectively. In this example, the second error term \u03b52 is computed as a vector product \u03c8rq*\u03c8\u2032rd\u2212\u03c8rd*\u03c8\u2032rq. At 113, a flux modulus is calculated for use by the estimation controller, which can be either the stator flux modulus |\u03c8S| or the rotor flux modulus |\u03c8r|, The current speed is then estimated at 114 using one of the error terms \u03b51 and \u03b52, where the controller 26 (FIG. 1) generates a new estimate of the speed \u03c9\u2032r based on the controller gain parameters KP 26a and KI 26b (FIG. 1), the reciprocal of the square of either the stator flux modulus 1/|\u03c8S|2 or the rotor flux modulus 1/|\u03c8r|2, and the controller error input e (selected as either \u03b51 or \u03b52 based on the current speed estimate \u03c9\u2032r from the last update cycle), and the estimate update is completed at 116. In the illustrated example, the gain parameters KP 26a and KI 26b are modified according to the flux modulus by the modified PI control output equation \u03c9\u2032r=(KP+(KI/S))*e/(|\u03c8S|2), where e=\u03b51 for \u03c9\u2032r less than or equal to TH1 and e=\u03b52 for \u03c9\u2032r greater than TH1. In this manner, the controller 26 provides the motor speed estimate \u03c9\u2032r using a dual range hybrid MRAS technique based on either torque or flux-based MRAS components with KI and KP being modified or adapted according to the reciprocal of the square of the flux modulus.",
