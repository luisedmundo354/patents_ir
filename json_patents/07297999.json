        "A) Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a semiconductor device having capacitors and its manufacture method, and more particularly to a semiconductor device having capacitors disposed on conductive plugs formed in an interlayer insulating film and its manufacture method.",
        "B) Description of the Related Art",
        "A tendency of high-speed processing or storing a large amount of data has increased recently, with development of digital technologies. From this reason, semiconductor devices used in electronic apparatus are required to have high integration and high performance.",
        "In order to realize high integration of a semiconductor memory device, e.g., a DRAM, instead of using conventional silicon oxide or silicon nitride, a variety of studies have been made on technologies of using ferroelectric material or high dielectric constant material as the material of a dielectric film of a capacitor constituting DRAM.",
        "Vigorous studies have been made also on technologies of using a ferroelectric film having spontaneous polarization as a capacitor dielectric film, in order to realize a nonvolatile RAM capable of reading and writing data at low voltage and at high speed. The semiconductor storage device of this type is called a ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM).",
        "A ferroelectric memory stores data by utilizing hysteresis characteristics of ferroelectric substance. A ferroelectric memory has a ferroelectric capacitor which is constituted of a ferroelectric film and a pair of electrodes sandwiching the ferroelectric film. The ferroelectric film generates polarization corresponding to a voltage applied across the electrodes, and spontaneous polarization is left even the applied voltage is removed. As the polarity of an applied voltage is reversed, the polarity of spontaneous polarization is also reversed. Data can be stored by relating two polarities of spontaneous polarization to data \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d, respectively. Data can be read by detecting the polarity of spontaneous polarization. As compared to a flash memory, a ferroelectric memory can operate at a lower voltage and can write data at higher speed and with a smaller electric power.",
        "A ferroelectric film constituting a capacitor of a ferroelectric memory is made of lead zirconate titanate (PZT), La-doped PZT (PLZT), PZT-based material finely doped with Ca, Sr or Si, Bi layer structure compound such as SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT, Y1) and SrBi2(Ta, Nb)2O9 (SBTN, YZ) or the like. A ferroelectric film is formed by a sol-gel method, sputtering, metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) or the like.",
        "Generally, by using these film forming methods, a ferroelectric film in an amorphous phase or in a microcrystal phase is formed on a lower electrode. The crystalline structure is transformed into a perovskite structure or a bismuth layer structure by succeeding heat treatment. It is necessary to use, as the electrode material of a capacitor, material hard to be oxidized or material capable of retaining conductivity even if it is oxidized. Platinum group metal such as platinum (Pt) or iridium (Ir), and its oxide such as iridium oxide (IrOx) are generally and widely used as the electrode material. Aluminum (Al) is generally used as a wiring material just like general semiconductor devices.",
        "A ferroelectric memory is required to have higher integration and higher performance just like other semiconductor devices, so a cell area is required to be reduced further in the near future. In order to reduce a cell area, it is effective to adopt a stack structure instead of a planar structure. The \u201cstack structure\u201d is a structure that a capacitor is disposed just above a conductive plug (contact plug) formed on the drain of a transistor constituting a memory cell. In a ferroelectric memory of a conventional stack structure, a capacitor has a structure that a barrier metal film, a lower electrode, a ferroelectric film and an upper electrode are laminated in this order just above a conductive plug made of tungsten (W) or the like. The barrier metal film has a role of preventing oxidation of the conductive plug. Since material is selected often which provides both the function of a barrier material film and the function of a lower electrode, it is difficult to definitely distinguish between the barrier metal film and lower electrode. Generally, the barrier metal film and lower electrode are made of a combination of two or more films selected from a group consisting of a TiN film, a TiAlN film, an Ir film, an IrO2 film, a Pt film and a SRO (SrRuO3) film.",
        "It is important to control orientation of a ferroelectric film so as to be oriented uniformly to manufacture a ferroelectric memory having good electric characteristics and high product yield. Orientation of the ferroelectric film is influenced greatly by orientation of a lower electrode. Namely, by controlling orientation of the lower electrode so as to be oriented uniformly, orientation of the ferroelectric film can be made uniform. Therefore, in order to manufacture a ferroelectric memory having good electric characteristics and high product yield, it is important to control orientation of the lower electrode so as to be oriented uniformly.",
        "JP-A-2000-91511 discloses a method of executing rapid thermal annealing of a lower electrode in inert gas in a temperature range between about 400\u00b0 C. and 900\u00b0 C. after the lower electrode is formed and before a ferroelectric film is deposited, in order to maximize spontaneous polarization of a ferroelectric capacitor.",
        "JP-A-HEI 11-168174 discloses a method of executing heat treatment in a temperature range between 200\u00b0 C. and 300\u00b0 C. or at a higher temperature after a lower electrode made of Ir is formed, in order to make residual polarization characteristics of a ferroelectric film uniform over the whole substrate surface and to prevent cracks from being generated in the ferroelectric film.",
        "JP-A-2002-151656 discloses a method of executing heat treatment at a temperature of 550\u00b0 C. after a lower electrode having a two-layer structure of IrOx and Ir is formed and before a PZT film is formed, in order to prevent deterioration of the electric characteristics of the ferroelectric film made of PZT.",
        "The methods disclosed in JP-A-2004-47633 will be described below. After a Ru film is formed which is used as a lower electrode of a ferroelectric capacitor, preliminary heat treatment is executed at 350\u00b0 C. to 500\u00b0 C. Thereafter, after a PZT film and the like are formed, heat treatment is executed at about 600\u00b0 C. to 700\u00b0 C. for crystallization. If the preliminary heat treatment is not executed, crystals of the Ru film grow abruptly during crystallization heat treatment and the Ru film has crystal grains irregular in size. If the preliminary heat treatment is executed, abrupt crystal growth can be suppressed during crystallization heat treatment and the crystal structure having grains equal in size can be maintained.",
        "A ferroelectric capacitor is disposed on a conductive plug in a via hole formed through an interlayer insulating film under the ferroelectric capacitor. The lower electrode of the capacitor is electrically connected to the conductive plug. When a capacitor ferroelectric film of oxide is formed, an oxygen barrier film of TiAlN or the like is disposed in some cases under the lower electrode in order to prevent oxidation of the conductive plug. In this case, while films from the upper electrode to the oxygen barrier film of the capacitor are patterned, a phenomenon (capacitor stripping phenomenon) is observed in which the capacitor is stripped or peeled off. The present inventor has found from various evaluation experiments that peel-off is likely to occur at the interface between the oxygen barrier film and the lower electrode.",

        "The inner surfaces of the via holes and the upper surface of the interlayer insulating film 12 are covered with two layers of a Ti layer having a thickness of 30 nm and a TiN layer having a thickness of 20 nm. On these layers, a W film is deposited until the via holes are filled completely. A thickness of the W film is 300 nm for example, unnecessary W film, TiN film and Ti film are removed by CMP to leave glue film consisting of the Ti film and the TiN film, and conductive plugs 15 and 16 of W in the via holes. The conductive plugs 15 and 16 are connected to the drain regions 5D and source region 5S, respectively.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2B, an oxidation preventive film 21 of SiON having a thickness of 130 nm is formed on the interlayer insulating film 12 by plasma CVD. Instead of SiON, the oxidation preventive film 21 of SiN or AlO may be formed.

The inner surface of the via hole is covered with a glue film and the via hole is filled with a conductive plug 25 of W. The conductive plug 25 and glue film are formed by the same method as that of forming the underlying conductive plug 15 and glue film.",
        "CMP for removing an unnecessary W film and glue film is executed under the condition that a polishing rate of the W film and glue film is faster than a polishing rate of the interlayer insulating film 22. For example, SSW2000 manufactured by Cabot Microelectronics Corporation is used as slurry. Over-polishing is executed slightly so as not to leave the glue film and W film on the interlayer insulating film 22. Therefore, the upper surface of the conductive plug 25 becomes lower than the upper surface of the interlayer insulating film 22 closing around the conductive plug 25, and a recess 25a is formed. A depth of the recess 25a is 20 nm to 50 nm, typically about 50 nm for example.",

If the substrate surface is processed by NH3 plasma before the Ti film is formed, NH groups are bonded to oxygen atoms on the surface of the interlayer insulating film 22. As a result, Ti atoms supplied to the surface of the interlayer insulating film 22 become easy to move on the surface without being captured by oxygen atoms.

The intermediate layer 34 improves adhesion between the oxygen barrier film 33 and upper electrode layer 36. A temperature of this heat treatment is higher than the substrate temperature at which the lower electrode layer 36 is formed, and can heat the substrate whole surface generally uniformly.

In the sample shown in FIG. 5A, it can be seen that some points corresponding to capacitors are black. It has been found from observation of the cross section that the capacitor stripping phenomenon occurred at the black point. In contrast, in the sample shown in FIG. 5B manufactured by the embodiment method, no capacitor stripping phenomenon occurred. By disposing the intermediate layer 34 between the oxygen barrier film 33 and lower electrode 36, the capacitor stripping phenomenon can be prevented.",

The glue film may have a two-layer structure of a Ti film formed by sputtering and a TiN film formed by MOCVD. After the TiN film is formed, a plasma process is performed using mixture gas of N2 gas and H2 gas in order to remove carbon from the TiN film. In this case, since the hydrogen barrier film 40 prevents impregnation of hydrogen, it is possible to prevent the upper electrode 38 from being reduced. Further, since the IrO composition ratio of the upper layer portion of the upper electrode 38 is set near to a stoichiometric composition ratio, the upper electrode 38 is hard to serve as a catalyst to hydrogen. It is therefore difficult that the dielectric film 37 is reduced by hydrogen radical.",

        "In order to confirm the effects of the heat treatment, Samples A, B and C of three types were manufactured. For Sample A, after the oxygen barrier film 36 was formed, the PZT film was formed on the oxygen barrier film 36 without performing heat treatment. For Sample B, after the oxygen barrier film 36 was formed, heat treatment was performed in an Ar atmosphere for 60 seconds at 750\u00b0 C. before the PZT film is formed.

        "For Sample A, a temperature when the lower electrode layer 36 is formed is relatively low so that crystalline grains are small just after the lower electrode 36 is formed. Since a temperature becomes higher when the PZT film is formed, crystalline gains of the lower electrode layer 36 grow and become large. Therefore, the surface of the PZT film formed on the lower electrode layer 36 becomes rough and clouded. There is a tendency that a temperature of a wafer peripheral area becomes relatively low while the lower electrode layer 36 is formed. As a result, while the PZT film is formed, growth of crystalline grains is likely to occur and the white turbidity is conspicuous in the wafer peripheral area.",
        "For Samples B and C, after the lower electrode layer 36 is formed, heat treatment is performed at a temperature higher than that at which the PZT film is formed. With this heat treatment, crystalline grains of the lower electrode layer 36 are made uniform, and growth of crystalline grains will not occur while the PZT film is formed. Therefore, the surface of the PZT film does not become clouded. In order to prevent a white turbidity of the PZT film, it is preferable to set a heat treatment temperature at which the intermediate film 34 shown in FIG. 2H is formed, higher than a temperature at which the dielectric film 37 shown in FIG. 2I is formed.",

        "As compared to Samples A and A1 without heat treatment prior to forming the lower electrode layer, Samples B and B1 with the heat treatment have a suppressed (100) orientation and a strong (111) orientation. Therefore, an orientation ratio of (222) plane is improved. Particularly in the wafer peripheral area, improvement of the orientation ratio of (222) plane is considerable.",
        "As in the above-described embodiment, it is possible to prevent occurrence of the capacitor stripping phenomenon by forming the intermediate layer 34 by performing heat treatment after the lower electrode layer 36 is formed and before the ferroelectric film is formed. Further, crystallinity and orientation of the ferroelectric film can be improved by performing heat treatment at a temperature higher than that at which the ferroelectric film is formed. In this manner, the switching characteristics of the ferroelectric capacitor 35 can be suppressed from being degraded.",

In the first embodiment, as shown in FIG. 2D, CMP is stopped in the state that the base conductive film 30 is left on the interlayer insulating film 22. However, in the second embodiment, CMP continues until the surface of the interlayer insulating film 22 is exposed. Therefore, in the second embodiment, the base conductive film 30 is left only in the recess formed at the position of the conductive plug 25. Since the upper surface of the interlayer insulating film 22 and the upper surface of the base conductive film 30 have the same level, the surface is planarized. Succeeding processes are the same as those of the first embodiment.",
