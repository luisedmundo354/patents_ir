The first XYZ transfer device 501 picks up at a time and holds four pre-test ICs heated to be a predetermined temperature on the heat plate 503, transfers the same and releases to the concave portions 502c of the loader buffer portion 502. The loader buffer portion 502 holding the four ICs to be tested moves the ICs to be tested from the operation range of the first XYZ transfer device 501 to the operation range of the YZ transfer device 310 as a result of extending the X-axis direction actuator 502b. Note that, as will be explained later on, alignment of positions of the ICs to be tested is performed by the alignment device 320 before a test, so that the concave portions 502c are not necessarily provided on the movable portion 502a and, for example, the surface of the movable portion 502a may be a flat surface provided with suction pads facing vertically upward. When suction pads are provided on the surface of the movable portion 502a, the first XYZ transfer device 501 puts ICs to be tested on the suction pads, the ICs are sucked by the suction pads provided on the movable portion 502a, the X-axis direction actuator 502b is extended to transfer the ICs into the operation range of the YZ transfer device 310, the suction pads releases the ICs when the transfer is completed, and the ICs are held by the YZ transfer device 310.",

Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 22A and FIG. 22B, a centering function is provided for returning the holding side contact arm 317 in the X-axis and Y-axis directions and the \u03b8 rotation about the Z-axis, so that the center line CL of the holding side contact arm 317 substantially matches the center line OL of the root side contact arm 316 after releasing the IC to be tested.",
        "As shown in FIG. 5, FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, the lock-and-free mechanism 318 mainly comprises a lock-and-free fixing portion 3181, a lock-and-free movable portion 3182, restriction pistons 3183, centering pistons 3184 and centering balls 3185.",
        "The lock-and-free fixing portion 3181 has an outer shape of an approximate square pole, wherein a hollow portion is formed inside of the lower portion to receive a part of the lock-and-free movable portion 3182.

        "Furthermore, inside the lock-and-free fixing portion 3181, a hollow portion is formed for being attached with two restriction pistons 3183, two centering pistons 3184 and two centering balls 3185. On one side surface of the lock-and-free fixing portion 3181 is formed a restriction air supply inlet 3181b for supplying an air to the restriction pistons 3183, and a restriction air path 3181c is formed from the restriction air supply inlet 3181b to the two restriction pistons 3183. Similarly, one side surface of the lock-and-free fixing portion 3181 is formed a centering air supply inlet 3181d for supplying an air to the centering pistons 3184, and a centering air path 3181e is formed from the centering air supply inlet 3181d to the two centering pistons 3184.

Thus, the lock-and-free movable portion 3182 is held by the lock-and-free fixing portion 3181, a movement of the lock-and-free movable portion 3182 in the Z-axis direction is suppressed and movement of the lock-and-free movable portion 3182 in the X-axis and Y-axis directions and in the \u03b8 rotation direction about the Z-axis are permitted.",
        "Also, at the upper portion of the lock-and-free movable portion are formed two ball receiving portions 3182a having a concave arc shaped upper surface for supporting the centering ball 3185. The center of the concave arc shape of the ball receiving portion 3182a is made to match with the center line of the centering piston 3184 during a centering operation.",

        "By providing the lock-and-free mechanism 318 as explained above between the root side contact arm 316 and the holding side contact arm 317 for holding an IC to be tested, each of the holding side contact arms 317 does not need to comprise a driving portion for an alignment of a position of an IC to be tested, so that a weight of the movable head portion 312 of the YZ transfer device 310 can be reduced, movement at a high speed becomes possible, and the frequency of erroneous contact occurrence can be reduced.",
        "The contact portion recognition CCD camera 312b is an image pickup means for taking an image of respective contact portions 301 of the test head 300 and used for recognizing positions and postures of the respective contact portions 301 when a lot of ICs to be tested is changed, etc.",
        "An image taken by the CCD camera 312b is transmitted as image information to an image processing means 70. The image processing means 70 extracts positions of a plurality of contact pins 302 from the image information and a center position of the contact portions 301 and XY coordinate axes in the contact portions 301 are calculated from the extracted positions, consequently, positions and postures of the contact portions 301 in the image taken by the CCD camera 312b are calculated. Note that the calculation of the center position of the contact portions 301 and the XY coordinate axes is not limited to the extraction of the plurality of contact pins 302, and the calculation may be attained, for example, by providing simple type markers for alignment to the contact portions 301 and extracting the markers.",
        "The alignment device 320 is a means for performing an alignment of a position of an IC to be tested by aligning a position of the holding side contact arm 317. In the present embodiment, as shown in FIG. 1, two alignment devices 320 is provided with respect to one movable head portion 312, and a total of two pairs, that is, four alignment devices 320 are provided to the handler 10. Accordingly, an alignment of positions of two ICs among four ICs to be tested held by one movable head portion 312 is performed at a time, so that four ICs to be tested are aligned by performing the alignment for two times. For example, while a test is conducted by one movable head portion 312 of the YZ transfer device 310, a pair of alignment devices 320 performs the alignment on two ICs arranged at the second row on the first column and at the second row on the second column with the other movable head portion 312 and then performs the alignment of positions of two ICs arranged at the first row on the first column and at the first row on the second column, aligned ICs to be tested are effectively supplied to the test head 300 and operating rates of the test head 300 can be raised thereby. Note that the number of the alignment devices 320 is not limited to the number above and may be suitably set based on a time required for aligning ICs to be tested and a time required for testing the ICs.",

        "Note that calibration of the above contact portion recognition CCD camera 312b and the alignment CCD camera 326 is performed at the time of producing the handler 10.",
        "A specific method of the calibration is, for example, to place a translucent calibration gauge in a shape of an IC to be tested, on which XY coordinate axes are drawn, on an alignment device 320 in a range visible from the alignment CCD camera 326 and to take an image thereof by the alignment CCD camera 326 to read the XY coordinate axes drawn on the calibration gauge and the center position. Next, the contact portion recognition CCD camera 312b is placed above the gauge and an image thereof is taken to read the XY coordinate axes drawn on the gauge and the center position. The XY coordinate axes of the calibration gauge is used as a reference X-Y coordinate system for the two CCD cameras 326 and 312b.",

        "Next, in a step S100 in FIG. 12, images of two ICs to be tested arranged at the second row on the first column and at the second row on the second column are taken by the alignment CCD cameras 326 of the alignment devices 320 in a state that a predetermined pressure by the Z-axis direction actuator 313 is maintained. Image information taken by the alignment CCD camera 326 is transmitted to the image processing device 70.",

Note that a calculation method of one axis of coordinate AL in the ICs to be tested is, for example, calculating for every row an approximate line passing through the center of the input/output terminals HB forming a long row in the input/output terminals HB extracted in the step S200 and calculating an average line of the plurality of approximate lines. Note that, as to unevenness, etc. of positions of input/output terminals HB arisen in producing ICs to be tested, to improve accuracy of the positions and postures of the ICs to be tested, calculation of the other axis of the coordinate, etc. may be performed by the similar method as the above calculation method of one axis of coordinate AL.",
        "Next, in a step S400, the image processing device 70 compares positions and postures of the contact portions 301 in the image with those of the ICs to be tested. When the positions and postures are matched in the comparison in the step S400 (\u201cYES\u201d in the step S400), the alignment is finished. Note that positions and postures of the contact portions 301 in the image are obtained by making the positions and postures of the contact portions 301 in the image taken by the contact portion recognition CCD camera 312b and recognized by image processing in advance at the time of changing a lot, etc. be correspondent to positions and postures in the image by the alignment CCD camera 326. An example of an image of the extracted respective input/output terminals HB of an IC to be tested before the alignment, calculated center position CP of the IC, and one axis of coordinate AL of the IC illustrated for convenience is shown in FIG. 23 (it is the same also in FIG. 24). Note that, for a convenient explanation, the center position of the contact portion 301 and the XY coordinates in the image match with the origin in the image, that is the optical axis OP and the XY coordinates.",
        "When the positions and postures of the contact portions 301 in the image do not match with those of the ICs to be tested (\u201cNO\u201d in the step S400), in a step S500, the image processing device 70 calculates an alignment amount required in the X-axis and Y-axis directions and in the \u03b8 rotation about the Z-axis, so that the positions and postures of the ICs to be tested match with the positions and postures of the contact portions 301. The required alignment amount in the case shown n FIG. 23 is a movement of +x in the X-axis direction, a movement of \u2212y in the Y-axis direction and a rotation of \u2212\u03b1 in the \u03b8 rotation direction about the Z-axis.",
        "Next, in a step S600, the image processing device 70 transmits to the YZ transfer device control device 80 an instruction to make the lock-and-free mechanism 318 holding ICs to be tested arranged at the second row on the first column and at the second row on the second column to be in a non-restricting state. The YZ transfer device control device 80 controls to stop supplying an air to the restriction pistons 3183 of the lock-and-free mechanism 318 based on the instruction and, when the lock-and-free mechanism 318 becomes a non-restricting state, transmits a completion signal to the image processing device 70.",
        "Note that, for example, in the case where concave portions 317e are formed on the contact members 317d and a convex portion 321c is formed on the alignment movable portion 321 in another embodiment of the present invention, for easily fitting the convex portion 321c in the concave portion 317e, the lock-and-free mechanism 318 may be made to be a non-restricting state before fitting.",
        "Next, in a step S700, when the image processing device 70 receives the completion signal, the alignment amount calculated in the step S500 is transmitted to the movable portion driving device control device 90. Then, the movable portion driving device control device 90 drives the first driving motor 3221, second driving motor 3222 and the third driving motor 3223 of the alignment movable portion driving device 322 based on the transmitted alignment amount and performs alignment of positions of ICs. The movable portion driving device control device 90 transmits the completion signal to the image processing device 70 when the driving operations are completed.",

In this state, the center line CL of the holding side contact arm 317 is inclined with respect to the vertical direction by \u03b20\u00b0. Also, in this state, the spring 337 is contracted by the sliding operation of the Y-axis rotation following member 332, and when the IC to be tested and the contact portion 301 becomes a non-contact state after conducting the test, the spring 337 extends due to the elastic force, and a centering operation of the Y-axis rotation following member 332 is performed.",

        "Note that operations by the electronic device testing apparatus 1 other than the following operation of the first contact arm explained above are the same as those in the first embodiment.",
        "As explained above, as a result that the contact arm performs the following operation to the plane substantially in parallel with the inclined contact portion at the time the IC to be tested contacts the contact portion, erroneous contact can be reduced even when the contact portion is inclined, and damages on input/output terminals of the IC to be tested and contact pins of the contact portion can be suppressed.",

        "Also, when dealing with ICs to be tested of a kind not requiring aligning accuracy very much but requiring strict management of a pressing force at the time of the contact, for example, the base member 340 of the unit having four first contact arms 315a2 or the base member 340 of the unit having four second contact arms 315b before changing a kind is detached from the root portion 314 by unscrewing the bolt and a base member 340 of a unit having four third contact arms 315c is attached so as to handle the ICs to be tested of the kind. During this time, when the base member 340 of a unit having four third contact arms 315c is attached to the root portion 314, only the first air path 340a for suction and pressing of the base member 340 of the unit is connected to the second air path 314a for suction and pressing of the root portion 314. Note that the base member 340 of the unit is not formed the first air path 340a for a centering operation and restricting, the second air path 314a for a centering operation and a restricting operation of the root portion 314 become a closed state.",
        "As explained above, in the test of ICs to be tested of a kind not requiring alignment accuracy very much at the time of the contact, by changing the unit having the first contact arms 315a2 to the unit having the second contact arms 315b or the unit having the third contact arms 315c, functions required to the contact arms can be optimized. Also, when compared with the cases of the above first to third embodiments, a range of kinds of ICs to be tested able to be dealt with an identical electronic device testing apparatus can become remarkably wide.",
