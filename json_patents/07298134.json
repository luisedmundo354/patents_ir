    "description": [
        "The present invention relates to electrical-energy meters, also referred to as \u201cwatt-hour meters\u201d or \u201cpower meters,\u201d for measuring consumption of electrical power. More particularly, the invention relates to optical communications between electrical-energy meters and external devices.",
        "The reading of electrical-energy meters has historically been accomplished with human meter readers who visit a customer's premises and manually document relevant information from the meter. Such readings have usually been limited to information regarding the electrical consumption of the customer. Over time, manual meter reading has been enhanced or eliminated through the use of meter reading systems. In one example of a meter reading system, a probe is held in proximity to and communicates with the meter. The communication between the probe and the meter is two way and involves an exchange of information beyond just the electrical consumption of the consumer. Today, for example, diagnostic information can be communicated by the meter reading system.",
        "Information between an electrical-energy meter and a probe or other external device may be exchanged by two-way, optically isolated communications. In such cases, the electrical-energy meter will have an optical port with an optical transmitter and an optical receiver that communicate with the external device through a respective optical receiver and optical transmitter of the external device.",
        "Various styles of optical ports have been developed for electrical-energy meters. One style was developed in North America in conformity with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Another style was developed in Europe in conformity with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).",
        "The ANSI optical port and the IEC optical port differ in a few significant ways. First, the transmitter and receiver on an ANSI optical port are positioned in an opposite manner from the transmitter and receiver on an IEC optical port. In particular, when facing an ANSI optical port on an electrical-energy meter, the transmit channel is on the right and the receive channel is on the left. When facing an IEC optical port, by contrast, the transmit channel is on the left and the receive channel is on the right. A second significant way in which ANSI and IEC optical ports differ is the mechanical interface between the electrical-energy meter and the external device. For example, though not required under IEC, an IEC optical port commonly may have a number of small posts that are used to help align and hold a probe of the external device in place for the communication exchange. A typical ANSI optical port does not have such posts. An ANSI optical port, however, has a \u201cD\u201d shape and protrudes from the face of the meter whereas an IEC optical port is generally flush with the cover of the meter.",
        "Electrical-energy meter manufacturers have produced meter designs corresponding to the industry standard prevalent to the particular geographical area. This has led to the production and distribution of external devices configured to correspond to the electrical-energy meters. For example, in North America, external devices are configured to correspond to ANSI electrical-energy meters. In Europe, external devices are configured to correspond to IEC electrical-energy meters.",
        "As manufacturers desire to increase market share while selling a single electric-energy meter design throughout the world, there is a need to provide a single electrical-energy meter design such that the meter is able to communicate with external devices constructed in accordance with various industry standards, such as ANSI and IEC.",
        "In one embodiment, the invention is an electrical-energy meter, comprising a base for mounting the meter, a transformer mechanically coupled to the base for producing an electrical output proportional to an electrical current in a conductor of electrical energy, a circuit board electrically coupled to the transformer for calculating and displaying a cumulative amount of electrical energy passing through the conductor of electrical energy, a first and second optical transmitter and an optical receiver electrically coupled to the circuit board, wherein the first optical transmitter and the receiver facilitate optical communications between the electrical-energy meter and a first type of external device, and wherein the second optical transmitter and the receiver facilitate optical communications between the electrical-energy meter and a second type of external device. The first type of device may be constructed in accordance with the standard ANSI C12.10-1997 published by the American National Standards Institute, and the second type of device may be constructed in accordance with the standard IEC 62056-21 (2002) published by the International Electrotechnical Commission.",
        "In an alternative embodiment, the electrical-energy meter may comprise a base for mounting the electrical-energy meter, a transformer mechanically coupled to the base for producing an electrical output proportional to an electrical current in a conductor of electrical energy, a circuit board electrically coupled to the transformer for calculating and displaying a cumulative amount of electrical energy passing through the conductor of electrical energy, and a first and a second optical receiver and an optical transmitter electrically coupled to the circuit board, wherein the first optical receiver and the transmitter facilitate optical communications between the electrical-energy meter and a first type of external device, and wherein the second optical receiver and the transmitter facilitate optical communications between the electrical-energy meter and a second type of external device.",
        "In a further embodiment, a template for a cover for an electrical-energy meter may comprise a base having a first and a second through hole, wherein the first through hole may substantially align with a first optical transmitter of an electrical-energy meter, the second through hole may substantially align with an optical receiver of the electrical-energy meter, and the template base covers a second optical transmitter of the electrical-energy meter when the template base is attached to the cover.",
        "In an alternative embodiment, a cover system for an electrical-energy meter may comprise a cover for attaching to the meter, the cover allowing optical access to a first and a second optical transmitter and to a receiver from a position external to the meter, a template which comprises a base having a first and a second through hole formed therein, wherein the first through hole substantially aligns with one of the first and second optical transmitters of the meter, the second through hole substantially aligns with the optical receiver of the meter, and the base covers the other of the first and second optical transmitters when the template is attached to the cover.",
        "In an alternative embodiment, a cover for an electrical-energy meter may comprise a first optical conduit, a second optical conduit in optical communication with the first optical conduit, and a third optical conduit, wherein the cover is capable of being attached to an electrical-energy meter, and wherein the cover is capable of receiving at least one of a first template for configuring the electrical-energy meter to communicate optically with a first type of external device and a second template for configuring the meter to communicate optically with a second type of external device.",
        "The invention may also include a method of configuring an electrical-energy meter for communication with an external device, comprising selecting an electrical-energy meter comprising two optical transmitters, and one receiver, wherein the meter is capable of being configured to communicate with an external device, selecting a preconfigured template that covers one of the transmitters when the template is attached to the electrical-energy meter so that the other of the transmitters and the receiver facilitate optical communications between the electrical-energy meter and external device, and attaching the selected template to the electrical-energy meter so that the template's through holes are substantially aligned, respectively, with the electrical-energy meter's optical receiver and one of the electrical-energy meter's optical transmitters, and so that the electrical-energy meter's optical transmitter that is not substantially aligned with a template through-hole is blocked or covered-over by the template.",

        "The electrical-energy meter 10 comprises a cover 20 and optical templates 200, 300. (See FIGS. 4 and 6). Cover 20 as well as optical templates 200, 300 can be used in conjunction with virtually any type of electrical-energy meter, including electrical-energy meters of the electromechanical type. Additionally, electrical-energy meter 10 is a round shape consistent with electrical-energy meters constructed in accordance with ANSI. The invention, however, is not limited to such electrical-energy meters and may be used with electrical-energy meters constructed in accordance with other industry standards as well.",

        "Base 12 is preferably molded from a reinforced thermoplastic material having the requisite mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, flammability rating, UV stabilization, and resistance to common solvents such as insecticides and cleaning solutions. An example of such thermoplastic material is polyketone, polycarbonate, or polybutylene terephthalate.",
        "Current sensor assembly 15 and the current transformer 26 can be mounted or coupled either directly or indirectly on base 12. Alternatively, electrical-energy meter 10 may use other current sensing techniques such as a shunt, a linear coupler (e.g., a Rogowski coil), a sensor to multiply voltage times a magnetic field (e.g., a Hall effect sensor), or a magnetic field sensor including an optical and semiconductor sensor. A circuit board 38 can be electrically coupled to current transformer 26. Circuit board 38 also receives an input or line voltage, i.e., a voltage corresponding to the voltage in the electrical-energy line (not depicted) to which electrical-energy meter 10 is connected. Circuit board 38 is adapted to calculate the total (cumulative) watt-hours of power that have passed through electrical-energy meter 10 over time based on the current and voltage input, using techniques and components commonly known to those skilled in the field of electrical-energy meter design. Circuit board 38 continually updates the cumulative watt-hours, and may be displayed on an LCD 40, which is mounted on inner housing.",
        "Inner housing 18 is preferably molded from a reinforced thermoplastic material such as polyketone, polycarbonate, or polybutylene terephthalate and includes a substantially flat front face 19. Front face 19 of inner housing 18 includes LCD 40 and a nameplate holder 70. Nameplate holder 70 is located below LCD 40 on front face 19.",
        "Cover 20 has a substantially transparent end 21 that provides visual access to LCD 40. Cover 20 includes a flange portion 22. A gasket 23 is positioned between flange portion 22 and base 12 to substantially seal the interface between cover 20 and base 12.",

        "Optical port 100 may be formed on front face 19 of inner cover 18 and may be optically coupled to circuit board 38. Optical port 100 facilitates optical communication between electrical-energy meter 10 and external devices (not shown). The term \u201cexternal device\u201d as used throughout the specification and claims means a device located outside of the electrical-energy meter with which the electrical-energy meter communicates. Optical port 100 enables service personnel to read, test, and calibrate electrical-energy meter 10 without removing inner housing 18 or cover 20 and without exposing service personnel to high voltages within electrical-energy meter 10. As discussed below, although optical port 100 is shown configured to allow electrical-energy meter 10 to communicate with external devices constructed in accordance with ANSI, optical port 100 can also be configured to enable electrical-energy meter 10 to communicate with other types of external devices.",

For example, for compatibility with external devices constructed in accordance with ANSI, transmitter 103 is located to the right of receiver 102 consistent with prior art electrical-energy meters constructed with optical ports capable of communicating with external devices constructed in accordance with ANSI. Also for example, transmitter 101 is located to the left of receiver 102 consistent with prior art electrical-energy meters constructed with optical ports capable of communicating with external devices constructed in accordance with IEC.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2A, it should be noted that optical port 100 can alternatively be constructed to include a transmitter 101 located between two receivers 102. Because transmitters are generally less expensive than receivers and are easier to use (from a circuitry point of view), the preferred embodiment is equipped with two transmitters and one receiver.",
