        "The present invention pertains to methods and systems for electronic component test time improvement.",
        "Production testing involves the individual testing of large numbers of parts to determine if they function acceptably. Each test that is performed on a part exacts a cost in terms of time expenditure. The time expenditure for each part, or component of a part is multiplied over large numbers of parts and thus can be very expensive.",
        "Production testing of integrated circuits includes the evaluation of several different integrated circuit parts. One such part that must be evaluated is the control circuit timer. Timers are used in the control circuitry of most integrated circuits, e.g., power amplifiers. A conventional timer 100 is shown in FIG. 1. Referring to FIG. 1, timer 100 divides a clock of frequency f0 into a clock of frequency f0/2N that is produced at an output of timer 100 in order to generate a delay. Such timers can be used to delay the power-up or the power-down of the power amplifier to allow noise associated with power-up and power-down to settle so as to facilitate \u201cclick-less\u201d and \u201cpop-less\u201d performance.",
        "Controlled delays provided by control circuit timers can range from milliseconds to seconds or greater. Although these wait times are beneficial as a means of facilitating click-less and pop-less performance during normal operation they add a substantial measure of time to the time that is needed to evaluate each part that is tested during the final production test. These wait times, that are expended on each part, constitute production time expenditures that are very costly in terms of time and expense. Such time consuming operation is highly undesirable in the production test environment.",
        "Accordingly, a need exists for a method and system that can help to speed electronic component test time in the production test environment. The present invention provides a method and system that accomplishes this need.",
        "In one embodiment, a timer circuit that has a normal mode and a test mode is disclosed. The test mode includes a power-up phase and a power-down phase. The timer circuit includes an oscillator and a first timer circuit portion coupled to the oscillator. The first timer circuit portion includes an input and an output. An output signal that confirms either the satisfactory or unsatisfactory operation of the first timer circuit portion is taken from the output associated with the first timer circuit portion in the power-up phase. The timer circuit further includes a second timer circuit portion coupled to the first timer circuit portion and the oscillator. In the test mode, the output of the oscillator is forwarded to the input of the second timer circuit portion; and in normal mode, the output of the first timer circuit portion is forwarded to the input of the second timer circuit portion. The second timer circuit portion also includes an input and an output. An output signal that confirms either the satisfactory or unsatisfactory operation of the second timer circuit portion is taken from the output associated with the second timer circuit portion in the power-down phase.",
        "In one embodiment, respective portions of a timer circuit are tested during respective phases of a production test such that a testing of the entire timer circuit is effected in a single power-up/power-down cycle of the production test, and time expenditures related to a testing of the entire timer completely in each single phase of the production test is avoided. In one embodiment, only a first portion of the timer circuit is tested in a power-up phase of a testing cycle thereby avoiding the time expense that would be incurred by testing both a first and a second portion of the timer circuit in the power-up phase of the testing cycle. Likewise, only a second portion of the timer circuit is tested in a power-down phase of the testing cycle thereby avoiding the time expense that would be incurred by testing both the first and the second portion of the timer circuit in the power-down phase of the testing cycle. By testing only a first portion of timer circuit in the power-up phase and only a second portion of timer circuit in the power-down phase, a testing of the entire timer circuit can be effected while significant time expenditures can be avoided in each phase of the testing cycle.",

        "FIG. 2A is a block diagram 200 of a system for testing the operation of a timer circuit of an electronic component (e.g., power amplifier 203) according to one embodiment of the present invention. In one embodiment, respective portions of a timer circuit 203B are tested during respective phases of a production test such that a testing of the entire timer circuit is effected in a single power-up/power-down cycle of the production test, and time expenditures related to a testing of the entire timer completely in each single phase of the production test is avoided. In one embodiment, testing system 201 tests only a first portion of timer circuit 203B in a power-up phase of a testing cycle thereby avoiding the time expense that would be incurred by testing both a first and a second portion of timer circuit 203B in the power-up phase of the testing cycle. Likewise, testing system tests only a second portion of timer circuit 203B in a power-down phase of the testing cycle thereby avoiding the time expense that would be incurred by testing both the first and the second portion of timer circuit 203B in the power-down phase of the testing cycle. By testing only a first portion of timer circuit 203B in the startup phase and only a second portion of timer circuit 203B in the power-down phase, a testing of the entire timer circuit can be effected while significant time expenditures can be avoided in each phase of the testing cycle. It should be appreciated that since the value of the supply current in the power-down phase is an extremely important specification of battery powered electronic systems and need to be tested, allocating the testing of parts of timer circuit 203B between power-up and power-down phases is convenient as it is accommodated by test phases that are already a part of existing production test processes.",
        "In the FIG. 2A embodiment, power amplifier 203 includes amplifier circuit 203A and timer circuit 203B. Referring to FIG. 2A, power-up/power-down test control system 201A is employed to trigger the powering up and powering down of power amplifier 203. And, performance analysis system 201B receives outputs from timer circuit 203B that can be used to confirm the acceptable function of timer circuit 203B. In one embodiment, in a power-up phase of testing the timer circuit 203B output is taken from a first output that corresponds to a first portion of the timer circuit, and, in a power-down phase of testing, the timer circuit 203B output is taken from a second output that corresponds to another portion of timer circuit 203B as is discussed in detail below with reference to FIG. 3A.",
        "As is illustrated in FIG. 2A, power amplifier 203 is tested by testing system 201 to determine if power amplifier 203 meets acceptable performance standards. In one embodiment, the performance of power amplifier 203 is assessed during both power-up and power-down phases of a test cycle. As a part of such testing, the performance of various components of power amplifier 203, such as timer circuit 203B are tested, as is discussed in detail herein.",
        "In one embodiment, power amplifier 203 can be packaged in a commercial integrated circuit package arrangement and does not require the use of additional pins (to trigger testing of timer circuit 203B). It should be appreciated that during production testing, existing power amplifier input and output pins can be used to initiate the power-up and power-down phases of the test and to obtain desired output signals. In one embodiment, power amplifier 203 can be operated in both test and normal modes. In test mode, the power-up and power-down delays are provided by either a first or a second portion of timer circuit 203B (but not both) and thus are abridged. By contrast, in normal mode, the power-up and power-down delays are provided by both portions of timer circuit 203B and thus the full delay of timer circuit 203B is generated. In the FIG. 2A embodiment, power amplifier 203 includes amplifier circuit 203A and timer circuit 203B.",
        "In one embodiment, timer circuit 203B can be a part of the control circuit of power amplifier 203. Moreover, timer circuit 203B can be employed to generate a delay that can minimize or eliminate audible noise (e.g., pop) by delaying power-up or power-down cycles. In one embodiment, the timer has two modes of operation: (1) test mode and (2) normal mode. In test mode a generated delay is provided by only a portion of timer circuit 203B and thus the delay is abridged. In normal mode delay is provided by the entire timer circuit 203B and thus is longer. In production test it is advantageous to avoid the longer delay that is generated by timer circuit 203B in normal mode.",
        "In one embodiment, timer circuit 203B has two distinct portions, and outputs that correspond to each portion (see discussion made with reference to FIG. 3A). In test mode, upon power-up an output that provides an indication of the proper function of the first portion of timing circuit 203B is taken from a first output that is associated with the first portion of timing circuit 203B. And, upon powering down, an output that provides an indication of the proper function of the second portion of timing circuit 203B is taken from the second output that is associated with the second portion of timer circuit 203B.",
        "FIGS. 2B and 2C are diagrams that illustrate the operation of timer circuit 203B in normal and test mode respectively according to one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 2B illustrates the operation of timer circuit 203B in normal mode. Referring to FIG. 2B, starting from a power-up state 251, when the power amplifier is prompted to shutdown in normal mode, a timer circuit, e.g., 203B in FIG. 2A, causes the actual shutdown of the power amplifier to be delayed, for instance, by 1 second, shown at state 253, which is the full delay provided by the timer circuit, e.g., 203B in FIG. 2A. Thereafter, power amplifier is powered-down at state 255. Subsequently, when the power amplifier is prompted to power-up, a timer circuit, e.g., 203B in FIG. 2A causes delay to the full functionality of the power amplifier, for instance, by 1 second, as shown at state 257. Thereafter, power amplifier, e.g., 203 in FIG. 2A is powered-up at state 251.",
        "FIG. 2C illustrates the operation of timer circuit 203B in test mode. Referring to FIG. 2C, starting from a power-up state 251, when the power amplifier is prompted to shutdown, timer circuit 203B is prompted to forego the normal mode full delay (e.g., 1 second in the FIG. 2B example above), at 253, and to cause a shorter delay as is shown at 259, for instance 20 ms. Thereafter, power amplifier 203 is powered down at state 255. Subsequently, when the power amplifier 203 is prompted to power-up, the timer circuit 203B is prompted to again forego the normal mode full delay, at 257, and to cause a shorter delay, for instance 40 ms, as is shown at 261. Thereafter, the power amplifier 203 is powered up at state 251.",
        "In one embodiment, the timer circuit can be implemented as a part of a programmable circuit. In such embodiments, the length of the delays that are discussed above with reference to FIGS. 2B and 2C can be programmed and changed.",
        "FIG. 3A shows components of an exemplary timer circuit 203B according to one embodiment of the present invention. In exemplary embodiments, timer circuit 203B can be included as a part of the control circuit of power amplifier 203 as is discussed above. In one embodiment, timer circuit 203B can be employed to generate a delay that can minimize or eliminate audible noise (e.g., pop) associated with power-up and power-down of a device such as a power amplifier by delaying power-up or power-down. During a production test both power-up and power-down operations of timer circuit 203B are tested, and thus the power-up and power-down delays can add significant time to testing operations.",
        "In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, test mode delay is provided in the power-up and power-down phases of the production test by respective portions of timer circuit 203B. Thus, in test mode, the generated delay is shortened or abridged for both the power-up phase and the power-down phase of the testing of timer circuit 203B as is discussed herein. In a production test that involves tens of thousands of power amplifiers that need to be powered up and down, the time, and cost savings realized due to the shortened delay effected in the power-up and power-down phases can be very significant.",
        "It is important to note that, using the methodology described herein a complete testing of timer circuit 203B can be effected since the acceptable operation of the first portion of timer circuit 203B can be confirmed during the power-up phase of the production test and the acceptable operation of the second portion of timer circuit 203B can be confirmed during the power-down phase of the production test.

In operation, in one embodiment, during a power-up phase, the output is taken from an output 307 associated with the first circuit portion 303 as is shown in FIG. 3B. It should be appreciated that in one embodiment, in a power-up phase, the number of frequency dividing components that are included in the signal path to the output associated with first circuit portion 303 can be less than the number of frequency dividing components that are included in the signal path to the output 309 associated with second circuit portion 305. Alternately, in a power-down phase the output is taken from an output 309 associated with the second circuit portion 305 as is shown in FIG. 3C. It should be appreciated that in one embodiment, in a power-down phase, the number of frequency dividing components that are included in the signal path to the output 309 associated with second circuit portion 305 can be less than the number of frequency dividing components that are included in the signal path to the output 307 associated with the first circuit portion. Finally, in normal mode, the input of second timer circuit portion 305 is coupled to the output 307. The output of timer 203B is taken from output 309 associated with both the first and second timer circuit 303 and 305 as shown in FIG. 3D. In this mode the length of the delay is based on components (e.g., frequency dividing components) of both the first and second circuit portions, 303 and 305. Thus, the number of frequency dividing components that are included in the signal path to output 309 during normal mode is greater than the number of frequency dividing components included in the signal path during test mode.",
