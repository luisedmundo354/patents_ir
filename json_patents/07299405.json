        "The present invention relates generally to information management and more particularly to multi-media-based, real-time, interactive information management for supporting collaborative interaction among a group of participants.",
        "In any project involving a group of people, cooperative and coordinated interaction typically is key to the success or failure of the undertaking. The project begins with a series of meetings to identify the desired goals, and to begin understanding the tasks needed to achieve the goal. Numerous meetings subsequently follow to further identify how to achieve the desired goals. In an engineering setting, for example, this typically involves teams of engineers holding several meetings to understand the technical hurdles they face, and to develop and design the components which constitute the end product. In a marketing situation, product managers and sales persons convene frequently to define the product line or services, to identify potential markets and target customers, to develop advertising strategies and product roll-out scenarios, and so on.",
        "As a project continues along, various groups of the project team will have periodic meetings to address and resolve issues and problems which inevitably arise during the course of any significant endeavor. Meetings will take place to assess the progress of the project, to assess the scope of the effort in view of changing external conditions, to re-order priorities and so on.",
        "Sometimes, the meetings are difficult to convene. For example, engineers from various offices in geographically distant locations might need to participate. Certain members may not be conveniently available; e.g. they are on the road at a customer site.",
        "The creation and dissemination of information is often inefficiently managed. Conventionally, attendees in a meeting record the events of the meeting by taking notes, whether handwritten, or entered in a portable computer such as a laptop computer, or entered into a personal data accessory (PDA), or by video taping the meeting. Notes of the meeting events are recorded from the point of view of the observer. Consequently information that is omitted and retained will be a function of the experiences and understandings (or misunderstandings) of the observer. In addition, note taking activity tends to distract from the discussion taking place, and so it is possible that certain points of interest might be missed.",
        "Such inefficiencies of information management are exacerbated when in so-called \u201cbrainstorming sessions,\u201d when ideas are presented at a quick pace and many trains of thought are produced. Participants generally stop taking notes at that point, being frustrated by the flurry of information being presented. The situation is further aggravated for those attendees who are at remote locations, being unable to fully participate in the session.",
        "Documentation may not always be readily available. For example, a topic may arise which was unexpected and for which the relevant materials are not at hand. This creates inefficiency because another meeting must then be scheduled with the risk that the needed participants may have conflicting schedules. At other times, the meeting may need to be stalled until needed material is obtained.",
        "Notes and ideas developed from previous meetings are not always available. The shear volume of information accumulated over the course of many meetings may require the expenditure of much human effort to sort through the material and to render it in a readily accessible form. A problem, of course, is that one cannot know a priori what information will be relevant in subsequent meetings. Consequently, a fully cross-referenced index is desirable, but tedious and typically not made.",
        "Although computers have tremendously improved document management and workflow process in many business settings, there has been very poor computer support for the creative and intellectual activities which take place in meetings and brainstorming sessions in the work environment. Means for capturing these events is important not only for preserving corporate knowledge, but also for facilitating the dissemination of ideas and the assimilation of information. With the availability of ever-increasing processor speed, communication bandwidth, and storage capacity, overcoming the technical impediments are no longer an issue. Instead, the effective coordination and utilization of vast amounts of information generated when individuals collaborate toward a common goal become the challenge.",
        "A need therefore exists for a method and system to provide information support services during a meeting. It is desirable to provide a method and system which can effectively capture the events of the meeting. There is a need to provide access and retrieval of information that can facilitate the progress of the meeting. It is further desirable to provide these capabilities with minimal human intervention so as not to distract the participants in the meeting.",
        "An information support system in accordance with the invention facilitates the management information during a meeting. Information retrieval and other management functions are provided during an ongoing meeting. The meeting participants are alleviated of the distracting tasks of manually accessing the information, having to delay topics of discussion while certain documents must be manually retrieved, and so on.",
        "In accordance with the invention, a method and system for managing information during a meeting includes recording the activities of the participants in a meeting during the meeting. A participant directive is identified by analyzing the recorded meeting data. The participant directive represents a desired action on certain information. In response to the participant directive, the desired action is acted upon. The participant directive is determined by an analysis of the textual content of the recorded meeting data. The directive is either an explicit command issued by a participant or is implicitly determined based on the context of the meeting.",
        "Data interaction devices are provided for participants to interact with the data and to provide commands and other input to the information support system. In one embodiment, attendee identification capability is provided. Information access and presentation is based on the access permissions associated with the identified attendees. In another embodiment, attendee location tracking is provided. Information access and presentation is based on the location of the attendees, in addition to the associated access permissions.",

Various devices are shown equipped with a Bluetooth interface; such as personal data accessories 416. It is understood that other devices can be similarly equipped. A Bluetooth transmitter/receiver provides a data path between the devices and database component 160. In fact, data over the communication network 170 can be provided through this data path.",
        "The data rate for Bluetooth is 1 Mbps (megabits per second), as compared to IrDA which is 4 Mbps. However, for most circumstances a 1 Mbps data rate is sufficient. Where higher data rates are needed, such as in the case of video transmissions, another wireless standard known as IEEE 802.11b can be used. IEEE 802.11b provides higher data rates, up to 11 Mbps. Moreover, the standard defines operating distances of 30 meters. The choice of wireless standards, of course, will depend on commercial availability, cost factors and the like, for any given conference room configuration.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 5, it is shown that various processes associated with the foregoing data capture devices are initiated and execute continuously for the duration of a meeting. It is noted that for silent moments during the meeting data is not generated, though the process may be executing. A record video process 510 continuously collects data from the one or more cameras comprising panoramic camera component 210. Likewise, a record audio process 520 continuously collects data from the one or more microphones comprising the audio capture component 218. A whiteboard monitor process 540 monitors the activity occurring at each whiteboard. In one embodiment, whiteboard data capture occurs continuously as the user writes. In an alternative embodiment, data capture occurs on-demand, upon receiving a user's directive such a vocal command or the push of a button. Projector monitoring process 550 monitors the presentation of slides and captures the slide data each time a new slide is presented.",
        "A process 530 for receiving personal characteristics of the attendees in a meeting includes a continuously executing process 532 for identifying each attendee. This process includes receiving data from the identification badges worn by everyone. In one embodiment, a visiting attendee's presence is logged 534 upon entering the premises. This can take place, for example, at a receptionist's desk when the badge is initially issued. In another embodiment, a frequent visitor may have a permanently issued badge. A sensor at each entrance detects the visitor's ingress and egress and logs the activity to the database. In a co-pending application U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/714,785, filed Nov. 15, 2000, entitled \u201cA NETWORKED PERIPHERAL FOR VISITOR GREETING, IDENTIFICATION, BIOGRAPHICAL LOOKUP AND TRACKING\u201d and owned by the assignee of the present invention, such an automated identification system is disclosed whereby a visitor's proximity to a visitor kiosk enables the system to detect and log her presence. In another embodiment, a biometric data logging function 536 is provided in addition to attendance logging. For example, identification can be based on chromatic information and facial features of an attendee's image. Identity verification can be made at a receptionist's desk or at a visitor kiosk when a visiting attendee arrives.",
        "In yet another embodiment, biometric data logging process 536 includes location tracking capability. Multiple audio inputs are provided to allow for triangulating the location of each user. Alternatively, multiple Bluetooth receivers provide the triangulation data by noting the time differential between signals received from a user as she moves about the room. Knowledge of an attendee's location permits the information support system to route displayed information proximate her location. For example, a capture device (e.g., microphone sensitivity) is adjusted as a user moves about the room. As another example, if an attendee moves from one meeting room to another meeting room, any relevant information being provided to her is automatically relocated. Used in conjunction with the other identification aspects, certain sensitive data can be selectively displayed depending on who is in a particular room and what their access privileges are. More generally, the actions permitted can be made dependent on the location of an attendee and the other members in the vicinity of the attendee.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 5-7, data provided by data capture portion 110 and data interaction component 130 contain various cues which are discovered by the monitoring processes outlined in FIG. 5. These cues are fed to a data retrieval daemon 710. Similarly, text extracted by the processes shown in FIG. 6 feed into data retrieval daemon 710. The data retrieval daemon comprises various continuously executing programs which provide information services to support a meeting in response to the various cues detected during the meeting.",
        "There are cues which are explicit directives from the participants in the meeting. For example, data manipulation services 720 include document management activities such as file editing, file renaming, and file creation and deletion. On-demand internet access 722 is provided. Various messaging functions 724 are available to the members of the meeting, including electronic mail, voice over internet capability, message posting on the internet and in newsgroups, and the like. Communication functions 726 allow members to establish conference calls, connect to remote members, and so on. Information retrieval services 728 permit meeting members to access documents, meeting schedules, previously captured meetings, and so on. Typical cues include commands received from the voice command interface and commands entered from a keyboard or written on a whiteboard. The virtual reality generator can provide a virtual input interface through which user commands can be issued. Typical explicit commands include actions such as accessing a particular web page, composing email and specifying a list of recipients, and so on.",
        "In accordance with the invention, data retrieval daemon 710 processes implicit cues to provide information services in a context-driven manner. Implicit cues are inferred from the context of the meeting and do not result from a participant issuing a command. Thus, an explicit command might be \u201cCOMPUTER, display April shipping orders.\u201d An implicit information retrieval cue might be issued indirectly when a speaker mentions the name of a document, but does not call out to actually retrieve it. The data retrieval daemon, continually monitoring the video and audio recordings and using information provided by the processes outlined in FIGS. 5 and 6, makes such determinations. For example, data retrieval daemon 710 knows that a certain speaker is a visitor. By accessing the visitor's meeting schedule, the data retrieval daemon can access the web or some other information source for traffic conditions or transportation schedules and provide the information to the visitor at an appropriate time.",
        "As another example, data retrieval daemon 710 can be programmed to act on the detection of certain keywords or phrases. In response, the web can be accessed and a search made to pull up whitepapers, companies, or other such information for the participants of the meeting.",
        "In addition to the services discussed above, context-driven searches 730, 732 proceed in the background. The information, whether stored in database component 160 or obtained over the web, is accumulated and ranked for relevance. As additional context is received, a further refinement of the search criteria is made to update candidate information. At the appropriate time, the information can be presented.",
        "There are several ways in which meeting content can be used to retrieve relevant documents for real time feedback. For example, the audio transcription of a meeting within a time window, either from the beginning of the meeting to the current time, or within sliding time frame, can be used as query input. A single input can be formed collectively from all participants or separate tracks can be allocated to each speaker. Given a window of such text input, many conventional information retrieval techniques can be applied.",
        "Typical preprocessing techniques including stop word removal, stemming, morphological analysis, are applied first. Then, content words are identified based on the word frequency difference between the input text and English norm. Documents in the database are scored by how many content words they contained, possibly weighted by other factors such as how many other documents also contain a given content word. Finally, documents are ranked according to their scores on a given set of query words. The result may contain a fixed number of top ranked documents or a variable number of documents based on a threshold on the score. Of course, spoken input is very unstructured and noisy due to speech recognition errors. Techniques are know which can compensate for significant levels of errors.",
        "It is possible to provide a set of predetermined topics. The transcribed text in a time window can be classified to one of these topics using known document classification techniques. Typically, a single profile of word frequencies is computed for all documents belonging to the same category. To classify a new document, the word frequency profile of the new document is compared to the profile of each category. The document is classified to the category whose profile is most similar, and the profile for that category is then recomputed to reflect the inclusion of the new document. If none of the category profiles is of sufficient similarity, as determined by some threshold criteria, no topic is returned. It is reasonable to assume that documents within a category bear some relevancy to the meeting and would be retrieved for possible use.",
        "The set of topics may be manually defined, such as folders in a hierarchical document management system, or automatically inferred by a document categorization system. Document categorization works in similar ways to document classification. However, instead of trying to find a closest matching topic, document categorization analyzes the distribution of document profiles to find natural groupings using clustering algorithms.",
        "Several different embodiments of the foregoing are possible. For example, a singly content window can be created for the entire meeting or on a per speaker basis. Similarly, query retrieval can be applied to the entire web, a corporate database, or to an individual's document collection on the eCabinet\u2122. Feedback can be configured such that all users receive the same set of documents, or each receive a different set of documents tailored to his preference, or a combination of the two.",
        "Information retrieval from a recorded presentation basicallly follows the same process after applying oprical character recognition (\u201cOCR\u201d). It is worth pointing out some important characteristic about presentation recordings. Slides are usually much more structured than conversation, often having topics and subtopics that are clearly denoted. The appearance of characters on the slides (boldface, color, etc.) generally indicates the importance of such concepts. In addition, OCR performance is typically better than speech recognition and so the output is not as noisy. Slides usually contain short phrases, providing very high information content. Furthermore, the timing on slides provides an explicit window for its context. Based on these characteristics, one would expect more precise retrieval performance from presentations.",
        "Known online handwriting recognition software can be integrated with whiteboard capture devices to provide an additional query input. Since writings on whiteboard may be spotty and contain drawings or other non-character markings, a filter can be used to recognize only a limited number of words. Special keywords such as \u201cprint\u201d or \u201csearch\u201d may be used to guide the interpretation of subsequent strokes and trigger appropriate actions.",
        "To further improve the performance of speech recognition, OCR results (from a slide presentation, for example) and relevant documents can provide a contextual backdrop for the process. It is well known that speech processing relies heavily on contextual information, such as grammars and dictionaries. Therefore, any information about the context of a meeting can help improve the performance of speech transcription. Because of the highly structured, compact representation of slides, they provide a good source for a domain specific lexicon which can be extracted to assist interpreting meeting content. For example, we often see special terms or acronyms presented in slides. Such information can provide an additional lexicon to a speech recognition engine.",
        "Documents related to meeting attendees can also provide a hint about meeting content. Once the meeting attendees are identified, documents recently read by one or more participants are very likely to be relevant to the discussion.",
        "Referring to FIG. 8, an embodiment of retrieval interface 254 is shown. FIG. 8 shows in simplified detail an embodiment of a graphical user interface in accordance with the invention. The graphical interface comprises an information area 810. This area displays information such as the time, date and a title associated with the meeting for which the data was captured. Other information can be associated in addition to or instead of the information shown in the embodiment shown in FIG. 8. This area can be made read-only, though area 810 may be selectively write-enabled for authorized users to edit variable information such as the meeting title.",
        "A textual search area 820 provides text searches of the captured data. A search string can be specified via a text box 822. Check boxes for speech 824 and for slides 826 specify where the search is to take place. In one embodiment, the check boxes have a mutually exclusive behavior, namely, only one or the other box can be checked, to limit the search to one or the other of the captured data. In another embodiment, both check boxes 824, 826 can be checked so that the search is done in both of the captured data sources.",
        "A speaker area 830 is provided so that playback of the captured data can be selected based on the selected speaker. This area comprises a series of thumbnail images 832 of each speaker, along with identifying information such as their names. Since there might be a large number of attendees in a given meeting and since the interface has limited area, only so many speakers at a time can be displayed. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 8, three thumbnail images are provided. A slider control 834 allows the user to display other members in the meeting, three at a time by sliding the control in the left and right direction. This action is can be achieved by moving a pointing device such as a mouse, for example, to the slider button and dragging the mouse while \u201cclicking\u201d a mouse button. As the slider is manipulated in this way, the thumbnail images are updated with images of other members. The order of appearance can be alphabetical by name, by rank in the company, by age, and so on.",
        "A playback control area 840 provides graphical metaphors for conventional playback buttons similar to those found on a compact disc player. There is a play button 842 and a stop button 841. A fast forward button 843 plays back the captured data at an accelerated speed. A fast forward-to-end button 844 has a context dependent action. In the case where the captured data is a completed recording, the fast forward-to-end button simply takes the user to the end of the recorded data. In the case where the meeting is still in progress and data capture is still occurring, this button simply takes the user to real time viewing, allowing her to view the data as it is being captured. A rewind button 845 plays the captured data in the reverse direction in an accelerated manner. A rewind-to-the-beginning button 846 takes the user to the beginning of the recording session.",
        "The fast forward and rewind speeds can be varied. In one embodiment, additional controls (not shown) are provided which specify these speeds; e.g. 2\u00d7, 4\u00d7, and so on. In an alternative embodiment, simply clicking one of the buttons 843, 845 multiple times can effectuate an increase in the fast forward or rewind speed. The speed increases can cycle from 1\u00d7 speed up to a maximum speed and then drop back to 1\u00d7 speed.",
        "A time selection area 850 allows a user to enter a time indication to go directly to a specific time in a recorded (or presently recording) meeting. The time specification can be a relative time; i.e., so many minutes into a meeting. Alternatively, the time can be specified by the particular time of the day; i.e., playback of the meeting from 3:30 PM.",
        "In accordance with the invention, retrieval interface 254 allows playback of one data stream, for example video data, in synchrony with playback of another data stream, for example projection data. A master data selector 862 and a slave data selector 864, and a master time scale area 870 and a slave time scale area 874 are provided to facilitate this capability. The master and slave data selectors 862, 864 allow the user to select which captured data will be the \u201cmaster\u201d and which captured data will be the \u201cslave\u201d. The captured data include video recordings, audio recordings, slide presentations, and whiteboard data. Data selectors 862, 864 are dropdown menus which list the captured data available. FIG. 8 illustrates slave data selector 864 with its dropdown menu exposed, showing the list and showing that \u2018slides captured data\u2019 is selected.",
        "Controls 840, in particular fast forward and rewind buttons 843 and 845 respectively, can be used to view the data stream in an event-driven manner. For example, in the case of projection data an event might be the presentation of a new slide. During the display of a whiteboard recording, an event might be the completion of a writing action so that only the final written expression is displayed. In the case of a speech segment, the event might be the silent period of a pause during the discourse in the meeting so that segments of speech can be more easily skipped over.",
        "Time scales 870, 872 indicate the play time during playback. Time indicators 871, 873 move back and forth as the data is forwarded and rewound. A synchronization box 874 provides synchronized playback between the master and slave data when the box is checked. Time indicators 871, 873 can be manipulated by the user as another means by which to control the playback of the captured data, simply by dragging an indicator back and forth. In synchronized mode, dragging either of the time indicators causes playback of both the master and the slave data to advance or reverse in synchrony. If synchronization box 874 is un-checked, then dragging one indicator will not affect the playback action of the other.",
        "A master window 882 and a slave window 884 display the captured data being played back. A volume control 886 is provided for audio playback.",
        "When playback is stopped, the still images in the windows 882, 884 can be \u201ccut\u201d and \u201cpasted\u201d into other documents. Still images can be stored in any of a number of known formats such as JPEG, GIF, bitmap, and so on.",
        "A video clip composition area 890 provides controls for specifying clips of video which can be saved. A video clip of interest is selected by shuttling through the video to specify the desired segment. The \u201ccompose\u201d button concatenates the selected segments to produce the video composition. The \u201cclear\u201d button serves as a reset to so that a new video composition can be produced. A time indicator informs the user as to the length of the video clip. The video clips can be saved in any of the known video formats; e.g., MPEG, AV1.",
        "FIG. 9 shows an embodiment of a networked arrangement of the information support system in accordance with the present invention. Here, three instances of support system 100 are provided in three locations around the world, namely, a California site 902, a site in New York 904, and a site in Tokyo 906. Each site shares the same database component 160. In this embodiment, database component 160 is shown contained in communication network 170 to emphasize that the sites share a commonly accessible database component. Any of a number of known data sharing techniques can be used to implement this shared component. In practice, there may be multiple databases using synchronization procedures such as volume shadowing to ensure that each site logically perceives database component 160 as a single database entity. Communication network 170 allows an intranet local to each site to be accessible by the other sites. Appropriate firewall schemes and security measures can be implemented to ensure the secured access to the individual intranets.",
        "A particularly useful meeting paradigm is possible with the architecture of FIG. 9, namely, the 24 hour meeting. The meeting can begin in New York. Participants might generate documents, notes, and so on which are stored in the database. Later in the day, the California site comes on line. Since all aspects of the New York meeting have been recorded and are readily accessible, the California meeting members can quickly come up to speed on the highlights of the meeting and join in on the discussion. As the day comes to end in New York, the meeting can continue in California. As the California site begins to wrap up its efforts, the Tokyo site can join in to continue the effort. The Tokyo members would have complete access to all the notes, whiteboard sketches, presentations and even the comments and contributions of the attendees of the New York and California meetings. The cooperating of the information support systems 902-906 ensure that needed documents and other materials are prepared and ready so that as each site begins its work, a seamless transition of the meeting from one site to the next site.",
        "The figures sometimes show overlapping functionality. For example, data interaction devices are sources of for initiating actions by the inventive information support system; however, analysis of the information from the data capture devices can also result in context-driven initiation of actions. Hence, allocations of functionality among the figures are provided for the purpose of simplifying the explanation of the various aspects of the invention and should not be construed as limiting how the functions are provided. In general, there are no bright line distinctions or intimations as to where the actual functionality is located. Persons of ordinary skill will understand that such specific details are determined by design constraints, the hardware and software that is available at the time, performance considerations, cost considerations, and so forth."
