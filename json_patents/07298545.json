The non-linear optical crystal converts an input laser wave (referred to as a \u201cpump\u201d beam) into two output waves called the signal beam and the idler beam. The wavelengths of the signal and idler beams are determined by the pump frequency, the angle the pump wave vector makes with respect to a crystal axis of the non-linear optical crystal, and the phase matching properties of the non-linear optical crystal. The optical resonator cavity resonates at least one of the signal and idler beams.",

However, ferroelectric material is known to be highly susceptible to photo refractive damage and visible-induced infrared absorption such that OPOs using ferroelectric material as the non-linear optical crystal are confined to operating in the infrared region. Near-infrared OPOs using LiNbO3 and LiTaO3 as the non-linear optical crystal are used for low power applications. However, refractive damage limits their further development in high power OPOs. Accordingly, compact high repetition-rate high power OPOs broadly tunable in the visible and near-infrared are still not available.",

However, the devices described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,211,999 also suffer from photo refractive damage and light-induced absorption under intense radiation of >15 MW/cm2.

The crystal may alternatively be mode from MgO doped PPSLT. A pump laser 16 generates a pump beam having high repetition rate solid state laser pulses of nano-second scale duration and a repetition rate in the range of 100 Hz-100 kHz. The pump beam generated by the pump laser 16 is directed into the OPO cavity 110 and is focused by coupling optics 18 to provide an intensity below the dielectric damage threshold of the crystal 10 which is approximately 55 MW/cm2. To overcome the problem of photo-induced damage, i.e., photorefractive damage, and visble-induced absorption, the heating device 20 is used to operate the crystal at an elevated temperature of above about 100\u00b0 C.

Although four sections are shown in FIG. 2, the crystal may have any number of sections and is limited only by convenience of operation and cost of production. In FIG. 2, the second section 10b is aligned with the input and output mirrors 12,14 and produces the output wavelengths associated with that particular section. The OPO output is tuned by translating the crystal to align a different section 10a-10d with the input and output mirrors 12,14.

The signal wavelength is the upper portion of the curve and an idler wavelength is the lower portion of the curve. As indicated in the graph of FIG. 2, the signal wavelength and idler wavelength produced by each segment can be adjusted by adjusting the operating temperature of the crystal 10.

Each of the 17 segments includes a structure having a specific grating period. The large number of segments requires frequent switching between segments to achieve the desired output. According to the present invention, the number of domain segments is reduced by combining at least two adjacent grating periods. The method of combining periods in one segment is discussed in further detail below. The reduction in the number of segments facilitates the convenience of operation and reduces the manufacturing cost of the crystal. However, the combining of periods into one segment reduces the gain of the crystal. Accordingly, the amount of reduction in segments must be weighed against the amount of reduction in parametric gain which can be tolerated. Our experience in modeling crystals indicates that combining two or three consecutive periods into one segment provides the most optimal solution. In a first alternative embodiment, each consecutive pair of segments starting with segments 2 and 3 and ending with segments 16 and 17, is combined into one segment to produce a crystal structure 100 as shown in FIG. 5. Segment 1 is left alone in this case because it has sufficiently broad wavelength coverage (i.e., 909 nm to 1283 nm). The crystal structure 100 that has nine segments 100a-100i instead of 17 segments of individual periods. FIG. 6 shows another alternative embodiment of a crystal structure 110 in which three adjacent periods are combined. The total number of segments 110a-110f is reduced to six in this embodiment.",
        "There are two methods which may be used to combine consecutive periods into one segment. The first method is referred to as aperiodic structure method and the second method is referred to as quasi-periodic structure method. The following discussion uses the combination of the second and third periods from the table in FIG. 3 as an example. However, the same methods may be used to accomplish the other combinations. The first method is described in detail in the article by T. Kartaloglu, et al., \u201cSimultaneous Phase Matching of Optical Parametric Oscillation and Second-Harmonic Generation in Aperiodically Poled Lithium Niobate\u201d, J. Opt. Soc. Am., Vol. 20, No. 2, page 343 (2003), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The second and third periods in FIG. 3 to be combined are 8.16 and 7.98 \u03bcm. According to Kartaloglu et al., reciprocal vectors \u0394k1=0.77=2p/L (L=8.16) and \u0394k2=0.787367=2p/L (L=7.98) are first determined. Fourier components G(\u0394k1) and G(\u0394k2) are then maximized. A segment width of 3.5 \u03bcm is selected based on experience and an aperiodic pattern of inverted domain distribution is obtained. FIG. 7 shows a segment of the distribution according to the aperiodic structure method.",
        "The quasi-periodic structure method is described in H. Liu, et al., \u201cAperiodic Optical Superlattices Engineered for Optical Frequency Conversion\u201d, Appl. Phys. Lett. 79, pages 728-730 (2001), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. According to that reference, the reciprocals for the quasi-periodic structure are",

        "FIG. 9 shows an OPO 300 according to a further embodiment of the present invention in which one set of optical mirrors is used for an entire tuning range of the PPSLT crystal 10. The OPO 300 includes an OPO cavity 310 with a dichroic mirror 22 to deflect the pump beam by approximately 90\u00b0 toward the PPSLT crystal 10. Although the pump beam is deflected by approximately 90\u00b0 in FIG. 9, the pump beam deflection angle may be any suitable angle that allows the pump beams to clear the components surrounding the OPO 300. The dichroic mirror 22 is highly transmitting for a broad range of output wavelengths. In the embodiment of FIG. 9, a mirror 24 is arranged on one end, i.e., the input end of the OPO cavity 310 and has a silver coating. This mirror 24 has a reflectivity of R>95% for all output wavelengths. In a preferred embodiment, the mirror has a reflectivity of R>99%. At the output end, an output mirror 14\u2032 has a crystal with a highly refractive index such that the output mirror 14\u2032 has an essentially wavelength independent reflection of [(n\u22121)/(n+1)]2 on one surface and is broadband anti-reflection coated on a second surface. The arrangement of FIG. 9 is operable for all output wavelengths, i.e., 640 nm-3000 nm, with one set of optics. However, the output power is approximately half of that which is obtainable in the embodiment of FIG. 1.",
        "FIG. 10 discloses an OPO 400 with an OPO cavity 410 according to an alternative embodiment in which the broadly reflecting mirror of the embodiment of FIG. 9 is replaced by a grating 28. A beam expander 26 is optionally-included between the dichroic mirror 22 and the grating 28. In the embodiment of FIG. 10, the grating 28 is set in a Littrow arrangement. The wavelength is set by the setting of the grating 28 and is not affected by the changes in the temperature of the crystal 10. The grating 28 also facilitates a reduction in the bandwidth resolution of the output.",
        "FIG. 11 shows another arrangement of an OPO 500 with an OPO cavity 510 in which the output mirror of FIG. 9 is replaced by a grazing incidence grating 30 and a high reflecting mirror 32. The pump beam and output beam exiting the right side of the crystal 10 reflect off of the grating 30 and make an incident angle close to 90\u00b0. This arrangement is referred to as a grazing incidence and is described in more detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/834,755, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The beam that is reflected at the angle of incidence exits the OPO cavity 510. Another beam, called the first order reflection, diffracts off the grating and is directed to a reflecting mirror 32, which is adjusted so that the first order reflection reflects onto itself to produce an oscillating action for the OPO 500. The arrangement of FIG. 11 is capable of producing an output having a narrow bandwidth having a width of less than 100 MHz.",
        "FIG. 12 is a variation of the embodiment of FIG. 11. A pump beam is fed into the OPO cavity 610 by way of the grazing incidence grating 30. The dichroic mirror 32 is arranged outside of the grazing incidence grating 30 relative to the crystal 10. The reflecting silver mirror 34 of FIG. 11 is replaced by a mirror 36 that is highly reflective (reflectivity>98% or more preferably reflectivity>99%) at the pump wavelength and has a reflectivity R>90% for the range of output wavelengths. In this embodiment, the pump beam passes through the crystal 10 twice which doubles the single pass gain. An advantage of this embodiment is that the pump power requirement is reduced. However, the optical alignment is more difficult than the previous embodiments.",
        "The dual output of the OPO 100, 300, 400, 500, 600 is suitable for obtaining microscopic images of an object through non-linear optical interaction of the OPO output with the object to be imaged. In a specific embodiment, the pump laser 16, coupling optics 18, and the OPO cavity 110, 310, 410, 510, 610 according to the present invention is packaged in a single compact platform which is used as a light source for coherent anti-Stoke Raman spectroscopic microscopy (CARS microscopy). In FIG. 13, an output (the signal and idler beams) of OPO 100, 300, 400, 500, 600 is directed into a microscope 700. More specifically, the output of the OPO 100, 300, 400, 500, 600 enters a collimator 704 and reflects off of a dichroic beam splitter 706 toward an objective lens assembly 702 of the microscope which focuses the output beam onto an object 708 to be imaged. In this embodiment, the signal and idler beams are tuned so that the difference in wavelengths of the signal and idler beams is equal to the Raman wavelength of the object 708 to be imaged. An interaction of the output beam with the object 708 produces a CARS signal. The CARS signal reflected backward passes through collection optics 712 which focus the CARS signal onto a photon detector 710. Alternatively or additionally, a photon detector 716 and collection optics 714 may be arranged behind the object 708. By scanning the position of the light on the object 708, a two-dimensional CARS image of the object can be recorded. This process can be repeated for different distances of the object from the objective lens to produce three-dimensional images.",
