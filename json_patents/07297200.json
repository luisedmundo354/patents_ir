        "The present invention describes new water-soluble yellow azo dyes, processes for preparing them and their use as recording fluids, especially for the ink-jet printing process.",
        "The ink-jet process is a contactless printing process, where generally a distinction is made between two printing techniques: drop on demand and continuous stream. The drop-on-demand principle is that the ink in the form of a droplet from a nozzle is placed\u2014under electronic control\u2014in the right place at the right time, whereas in continuous stream printing the ink is delivered continuously and then, likewise after electronic charging, either impinges on the receiving medium (paper for example) or is diverted into a collecting vessel. To obtain prints of high definition and resolution the recording fluids and the dyes present in them have to meet corresponding requirements, particularly with regard to lightfastness and waterfastness. High lightfastness is of great importance in particular for exterior ink-jet applications and in the production of ink-jet prints of photographic quality.",
        "The most important part in all this is played by the dyes used in the inks. Despite the development of a large number of dyes there are only a few which meet the requirements imposed on them in a modern-day printing operation.",
        "Initially water-soluble reactive dyes based on the 1,3,5-triazine structural unit, which are used for dyeing or printing cotton fibers (textile printing), were employed. Their usefulness for producing ink-jet inks for ink-jet printing, however, is only limited, since the storage stability of the resultant inks is low and the lightfastnesses of the prints obtained are poor. If the possibility is exploited of allowing targeted reaction of the reactive anchor of such dyes with nucleophiles, the result, for example, is yellow compounds of the formula (1) in accordance with EP-A-0 755 984:",
        "",
        "These dyes are distinguished by high lightfastness; a drawback found, however, has been the sensitivity to hydrolysis and, consequently, a low stability on storage.",
        "There is therefore a need for improved colorants which are superior to the existing yellow dyes, in particular in storage stability, and at the same time have the other properties required for the ink-jet sector.",
        "It has been found that the azo compounds of the formula (2) and their tautomeric forms possess a high storage stability in conjunction with excellent waterfastness and good lightfastness.",
        "The present invention accordingly provides dyes of the formula (2)",
        "in which\n\n    A and B are identical or different and are a C6-C10-aryl radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by 1, 2, 3 or 4 substituents from the group consisting of C1-C6-alkyl, hydroxyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, carboxyl, sulfo, sulfonamide, amino and C1-C6-alkylamino; or are a 5- to 7-membered aromatic heterocycle which may be benzo-fused and may carry 1, 2, 3 or 4 of the aforementioned substituents, or\n    in which A is a radical of an azo dye of the formula (2a)\n\nD1-N\u2550N-D2-\u2003\u2003(2a)\n\n    \u2003in which D1 and D2 are identical or different and are a C6-C10-aryl radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by 1, 2, 3 or 4 substituents from the group consisting of C1-C6-alkyl, hydroxyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, carboxyl, sulfo, sulfonamide, amino and C1-C6-alkylamino;\n    Y is a group which contains oxygen and/or nitrogen and which if desired via X of the enolate function forms a 9- or 10-membered ring;\n    X is hydrogen, a monovalent metal cation, one equivalent of a polyvalent metal cation or a C1-C4-alkyl-, phenyl- or (C1-C4)-alkoxy-(C1-C4)-alkyl-substituted ammonium ion.",
        "Preferred azo dyes of the formula (2) are those in which\n\n    A and B are phenyl, naphthyl, pyridyl or pyrazolyl which may be substituted by 1 or 2 substituents from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, propyl, hydroxyl, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, carboxyl, sulfo, sulfonamido, amino and methylamino.",
        "Preferred azo dyes of the formula (2) are additionally those in which A is a radical of the formula (2a) in which D1 and D2 are phenyl or naphthyl which may be substituted by 1 or 2 substituents from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, propyl, hydroxyl, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, carboxyl, sulfo, sulfonamido, amino and methylamino.",

        "The reaction of (3) with (4) takes place preferably at from 0 to 40\u00b0 C. and at a pH of from 4 to 9.",
        "The diazotization and coupling steps can be carried out in accordance with conventional methods.",
        "The diazotization is preferably conducted in aqueous solution or suspension with sodium nitride at temperatures from 0 to 10\u00b0 C. and at a pH of between 1 and 3. The azo coupling is preferably conducted in aqueous solution or suspension at temperatures from 0 to 20\u00b0 C. and at a pH of between 3 and 9.",
        "The molar ratios between the respective diazonium salt and the respective coupling component are preferably 1: (0.8 to 2).",
        "Complexing with a metal takes place advantageously by adding an aqueous metal salt solution, e.g. a metal sulfate, chloride, bromide, hydrogen sulfate, bicarbonate or carbonate. Depending on the particular dye the complexing may be conducted in the acidic range and in the basic range. The temperature ought to be between 60 and 130\u00b0 C.; if desired, heating is carried out under superatmospheric pressure.",
        "The dyes of the invention can be isolated from the as-obtained, preferably aqueous reaction mixtures by salting out, filtration or spray drying, with or without partial or complete prior desalting by means of membrane filtration. However, an isolation step may also be omitted and the reaction mixtures comprising the dyes of the invention may be converted directly into concentrated dye solutions by adding organic and/or inorganic bases and/or humectants and, if desired, after partial or complete desalting by means of membrane filtration. Alternatively the complex dyes may also be used as presscakes (in flushing processes as well, if appropriate) or as powders. For further purification, the dyes in the form of their aqueous solutions can be passed over an ion exchange resin.",
        "The dyes of the invention may further comprise a shading colorant, preferably from the group of the colorants listed in the Colour Index, such as C.I. Acid Yellow 17 and 23, C.I.

The dyes can be isolated from the as-obtained, preferably aqueous reaction mixtures by salting out and filtration or by spray drying, if desired after partial or complete desalting by means of membrane filtration and/or ion exchange. An alternative is to dispense with isolation and to convert the dye-containing reaction mixtures directly into concentrated dye solutions by adding organic and/or inorganic bases, possibly humectants, preservatives and, if desired, after partial or complete desalting by means of membrane filtration. Alternatively the dyes may also be used as presscakes (in flushing processes as well, if appropriate) or as powders.

        "The present invention additionally provides recording fluids which comprise a dye of the invention and, if desired, other colorants for shading, as described above. Shading colorants of this kind are advantageously present in an amount of from 0 to 20% by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 10% by weight, in particular from 0.1 to 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the recording fluid.",

Preservation is then achieved with a biocide (e.g., \u00aeProxel GXL).",
