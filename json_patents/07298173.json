    "abstract": "A small computer system interface (SCSI) driver circuit having a programmable slew rate comprises N cascaded delay cells each including a data bit input, a delayed data bit output that communicates with the data bit input of an adjacent one of the N cascaded delay cells, and a delay time input that receives a programmable delay time value for setting a variable delay between receiving data at the data bit input and generating the delayed data bit output. N predrivers receive an output enable signal and a corresponding one of the N delayed data bit outputs and generate a predriver output signal based on the output enable and the corresponding one of the N delayed data bit outputs. N drivers have inputs that receive predriver output signals from corresponding ones of the N predrivers. An output port communicates with outputs of the N drivers.",

        "The present invention relates to electrical circuits that provide an output port having a programmable slew rate.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 1, a computer system 10 is shown. A plurality of computing devices 12-1, 12-2, . . . , 12-M, collectively referred to as computing devices 12, are connected by a communication cable 14. The communication cable 14 connects to differential signal bus interfaces 16-1, 16-2, . . . , 16-M, such as small computer system interfaces (SCSI interfaces), associated with respective computing devices 12. The interfaces 16-1, 16-2, . . . , 16-M are collectively referred to as the interfaces 16. The computing devices 12 may include a host controller, disk drive and/or any other device having a compatible SCSI interface. Terminators T-1 and T-2 include terminating bias resistors 18-1 and 18-2, referred to collectively as bias resistors 18, which are connected across conductors at opposite ends of the communication cable 14. In some applications, a single terminator T is used at one end of the communication cable 14. In practice, a plurality of cables 14 and terminating bias resistors 18 would connect the interfaces 16 to form a parallel data bus 20. The data bus 20 may have several channels that each carry a bit of data per cycle. The data bus 20 may include additional channels for control signals. For purposes of clarity, only one channel of the parallel data bus 20 is described herein.",
        "Turning now to FIG. 2, an output driver 22 of the prior art is shown. The output driver 22 provides an output port 24 that connects to the communication cable 14 and the bias resistor 18. A p-channel field effect transistor (PFET) Q1 has a gate connected to a PFET predriver 26. A drain of the PFET Q1 is connected to a voltage source VDD. A source of the PFET Q1 is connected to a drain of an n-channel field effect transistor (NFET) Q2. A gate of the NFET Q2 is connected to an NFET predriver 28. A source of the NFET Q2 is connected to a reference voltage VSS. The connection between the source of the PFET Q1 and the drain of the NFET Q2 provides one node of the output port 24. A PFET Q3 has a gate connected to a PFET predriver 30. A drain of the PFET Q3 is connected to the voltage source VDD. A source of the PFET Q3 is connected to a drain of an NFET Q4. A gate of the NFET Q4 is connected to an NFET predriver 32. A source of the NFET Q4 is connected to the reference voltage VSS. The connection between the source of the PFET Q3 and the drain of the NFET Q4 provides the second node of the output port 24. Such an arrangement of the PFETs and NFETs Q1-Q4 may be referred to as an \u201cH-bridge.\u201d",
        "When the PFET Q1 and the NFET Q4 are turned on, and the PFET Q3 and the NFET Q2 are turned off, then current flows in a first direction through the output port 24. When the PFET Q1 and the NFET Q4 are turned off, and the PFET Q3 and the NFET Q2 are turned on, then current flows in a second direction through the output port 24. As the current flows through the output port 24 in the first and second directions, high and low voltages are developed across the bias resistor 18. The high and low voltages typically range from +0.5V to 0.5V, and provide a data signal representing digital ones and zeros on the communication cable 14. Drive voltages applied to the gates of the PFETS and NFETS Q1-Q4 by the PFET and NFET predrivers 26, 28, 30, and 32, may be adjusted. The drive voltages determine a slew rate during transitions between the high and low voltages across the bias resistor 18. Such a configuration is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,597,233, the specification of which is incorporated herein by reference. While the output port 24 of the prior art provides an adjustable slew rate, the actual slew rate obtained may vary undesirably depending on variables such as a length of the communication cable 14 and manufacturing variables of the PFETs and NFETs Q1-Q4.",
        "A small computer system interface (SCSI) driver circuit having a programmable slew rate comprises N cascaded delay cells each including a data bit input, a delayed data bit output that communicates with the data bit input of an adjacent one of the N cascaded delay cells, and a delay time input that receives a programmable delay time value for setting a variable delay between receiving data at the data bit input and generating the delayed data bit output. N predrivers receive an output enable signal and a corresponding one of the N delayed data bit outputs and generate a predriver output signal based on the output enable and the corresponding one of the N delayed data bit outputs. N drivers have inputs that receive predriver output signals from corresponding ones of the N predrivers. An output port communicates with outputs of the N drivers.",

        "Referring now to FIG. 3, an output port circuit 40 is shown. The output port circuit 40 is connected to the bias resistor 18 by the communication cable 14. An output port 42 provides an output signal having a predetermined slew rate. A delay setting module 43 programmably sets slew rate by applying a delay signal to a delay time input 44. The delay setting module 43 may program all of the delay modules individually to two or more delay values and/or collectively to a common delay value. 1 to N conductors may be used to connect the delay setting module to the delay to the delay cells 46. In some implementations, the delay time input 44 may be a 3-bit wide parallel binary input providing 23=8 unique slew rates. Cascaded delay cells 46-1, 46-2, . . . , 46-N, referred to collectively as the cascaded delay cells 46, each receive the delay signal. Each of the cascaded delay cells 46 has an input 48-1, 48-2, . . . , 48-N, referred to collectively as the data inputs 48, that receive a data bit. Each of the cascaded delay cells 46 also has a delayed data output 50-1, 50-2, . . . , 50-N, referred to collectively as the delayed data outputs 50. Each of the data inputs 48-2 through 48-N is connected to a delayed data output 50-1, 50-2, 50-(N\u22121) of the preceding cascaded delay cell 46. The data input 48-1 of the first cascaded delay cell 46-1 receives a data bit from an associated computing device 12. Each cascaded delay cell 46 propagates its data bit from its input 48 to its delayed data output 50 after the delay time. Therefore, the data bit applied to the first input 48-1 propagates to the last delayed data output 50-N after N multiples of the delay time. In a preferred embodiment, N=8 and each cascaded delay cell 46 provides a delay time between about 125 picoseconds and 375 picoseconds. The preferred embodiment thereby provides a slew rate adjustable between about 1 nanosecond and 3 nanoseconds, although other delay ranges can be used.",
        "An output enable line 52 is active high and connected to a plurality of predrivers 54-1, 54-2, . . . , 54-N, referred to collectively as the predrivers 54. Each of the predrivers 54 has a data input connected to the delayed data output 50 of a respective one of the cascaded delay cells 46. Each of the predrivers 54 implements a truth table, described later herein. The truth table uses the output enable line 52 and the delayed data output 50 to generate four output signals. The four output signals are communicated over output lines 56-1, 56-2, . . . , 56-N, referred to collectively as output lines 56, of each respective predriver 54.",
        "The output lines 56 of each predriver 54 are connected to a respective driver 58-1, 58-2, . . . , 58-N, referred to collectively as the drivers 58. Each of the drivers 58 has an input for a reference current signal 60 and a driver output port 62. The driver output ports 62 are connected in parallel to form the output port 42. When the output enable line 52 is high, a data bit propagates through the cascaded delay cells 46 and causes the driver output ports 62 to turn on or off in succession. As each output port 62 turns on or off, a magnitude of a signal appearing at the output port 42 increases or decreases, respectively, thereby providing a predetermined slew rate.",
        "Turning now to FIG. 4, a partial schematic diagram is shown of the output port circuit 40. The three lines of delay time input 44 are shown individually as 44-1, 44-2, and 44-3. The delay time input 44 is connected to a digital-to-analog converter (current DAC) 63. A current output of the DAC 63 is applied to a bias voltage generator 64. The DAC 63 receives the delay signal and converts it to a current as is described later. The bias voltage generator 64 converts the current to a positive bias voltage 66 and a negative bias voltage 68. The positive and negative bias voltages 66, 68 are applied to each of the cascaded delay cells 46. The cascaded delay cells 46 use the positive and negative bias voltages 66, 68 to operate internal circuitry as described later.",
        "Circuitry of the drivers 58 will now be described. For the purpose of clarity, only the driver 58-N will be described.

An NFET Q9 is configured as a current mirror and has a drain connected to the sources of the NFETs Q6 and Q7. A PFET Q10 is configured as a current mirror and has a drain connected to the sources of the PFETs Q5 and Q8.",
        "A current source is formed from NFETs Q11, Q12, and a PFET Q13. A gate and a drain of the NFET Q11 are connected to the reference current source 60 and a gate of the NFET Q12.

The NFET Q12 and the PFET Q13 mirror the reference current signal 60 flowing through the NFET Q11 and provide current to the drivers 58. The NFET Q9 and PFET Q10 assure that the driver circuit output has a predetermined source impedance substantially free from influences resulting from process variations in manufacturing the NFETs and PFETs.",
        "Turning now to FIG. 5, a truth table 70 is shown. The truth table 70 has a first input column for the delayed data bit appearing at the delayed data output 50. A second input column is has a state of the output enable (OE) line 52. Four predriver output columns are provided, one for each of the predriver output signals PP, NN, PN, and NP. Entries in the four columns parenthetically indicate whether the associated PFET or NFET Q5-Q8 is turned on or turned off. A rightmost output column indicates a logic state appearing at the driver output port 62. The OE line 52 is a active high signal. When the OE line 52 is low, or zero, the PFETs and NFETs Q5-Q8 are turned off and the driver output port 62 is electrically open (3-state). When the OE line 52 is high and the delayed data bit is low, or logical 0, the PFET Q5 and the NFET Q7 are turned off, and the PFET Q8 and the NFET Q6 are turned on. This combination results in a logical 0 appearing at the driver output port 62. When the OE signal is high and the delayed data bit is high, or logical 1, the PFET Q5 and the NFET Q7 are turned on, and the PFET Q8 and the NFET Q6 are turned off. This combination results in a logical 1 appearing at the driver output port 62. Conventional combinatorial logic may be used to implement the truth table 70 in each of the predrivers 54.",
        "Turning now to FIG. 6, a schematic diagram is shown of the current DAC 63 and the bias voltage generator 64. The current DAC 63 has an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) with an output connected to gates of PFETs Q14, Q15, Q16, Q17, and Q18. An inverting input 74 of the OTA 72 is connected to a constant voltage source VREF. A non-inverting input 76 of the OTA 72 is connected to a drain of the PFET Q14 and to one end of a resistor 65. The other end of the resistor 65 is connected to the reference voltage VSS. The output of the OTA 72 provides a current proportional to a voltage difference across the non-inverting 74 and inverting 76 inputs. A drain of the PFET Q15 is connected to the supply voltage VDD and to the drains of the PFETs Q15, Q16, and Q18.

Drains of the PFETs Q18-Q21 are connected together and provide a programmable current output 78.",
        "Operation of the current DAC 63 will now be described. The PFET Q14 mirrors a current provided by the output of the OTA 72. A magnitude of the current is established by adjusting a resistance of the resistor 65. When the PFET Q19 is turned on by the first delay time input line 44-1, the PFET Q15 mirrors the current flowing through the PFET Q14. When the PFET Q20 is turned on by the second delay time input line 44-2, the PFET Q16 mirrors the current flowing through the PFET Q14. When the PFET Q21 is turned on by the third delay time input line 44-3, the PFET Q17 mirrors the current flowing through the PFET Q14. As the number of PFETs Q19-Q21 being turned on by the delay time input lines 44 increases, an increasing current flow is established through the programmable current output 78. The sizes of PFETs Q15-Q18 can be unequal to provide up to eight discrete levels of current flow through the programmable current output 78 in accordance with delay time input lines 44 turning on/off the PFETs Q19, Q20, and Q21.",

        "Operation of the bias voltage generator 64 will now be described. The current flow from the programmable current output 78 is mirrored by the NFET Q22. The NFET Q23 mirrors the current flowing through the NFET Q22. The PFET Q25 drops a voltage across its source and drain as it mirrors the current flowing through the NFET Q23. The drain of the PFET Q25 thereby provides the positive voltage 66 with VDD less the voltage dropped across PFET Q25. The PFET Q26 mirrors the current flowing through the PFET Q25. The NFET Q24 drops a voltage across its source and drain as it mirrors the current flowing through the PFET Q26. The drain of the NFET Q24 thereby provides the negative voltage 68 with a voltage equal to its source-drain voltage drop. The positive 66 and negative 68 bias voltages are applied to the delay cells 46.",
        "Turning now to FIG. 7, a schematic diagram of a delay cell 46 is shown. A source of a PFET Q27 is connected to the supply voltage VDD. A gate of the PFET Q27 is connected to the positive bias voltage 66. A drain of the PFET Q27 is connected to a source of a PFET Q28. A gate of the PFET Q28 is connected to the data bit input 48 of the delay cell 46. A drain of the PFET Q28 is connected to a drain of an NFET Q29, to one end of a capacitor C1, and to an input of an inverter 80. The other end of the capacitor C1 is connected to the reference voltage VSS. A source of the NFET Q29 is connected to a drain of an NFET Q30. A gate of the NFET Q29 is connected to the data bit input 48 of the delay cell 46. A source of the NFET Q30 is connected to the reference voltage VSS. A gate of the NFET Q30 is connected to the negative bias voltage 68. An output of the inverter 80 provides the delayed data output 50.",
        "Operation of the delay cell 46 will now be described. A magnitude of the positive 66 and negative 68 bias voltages establishes drain-source resistances of the PFET Q27 and the NFET Q30. If a logical 1 is applied to the data bit input 48, the PFET Q28 turns off and the NFET Q29 turns on, thereby allowing the capacitor C1 to discharge through the NFETs Q29 and Q30. A rate of discharge is determined by the magnitude of the negative bias voltage 68. With the capacitor C1 discharged, a logical 0 appears at the input of the inverter 80 and a logical 1 appears at the output of the inverter 80. The rate of discharge determines the delay time for the delay cell 46. Alternatively, if a logical 0 is applied to the data bit input 48, the NFET Q29 turns off and the PFET Q28 turns on, thereby allowing the capacitor C1 to charge through the PFETs Q27 and Q28. A rate of charge is determined by the magnitude of the positive bias voltage 66. When capacitor C1 is charged, a logical 1 appears at the input of the inverter 80 and a logical 0 appears at the output of the inverter 80. The rate of charge is preferably equal to the rate of discharge.",

The signal voltage 120 falls as the drivers 58 activate in succession according to the output signals NN, PP, NP, and PN.",
        "A time between each successive rising edge and/or each successive falling edge in the families of curves is equal to the delay time of the cascaded delay cells 46.",
        "Turning now to FIG. 9, families of waveforms are shown for the example output port circuit 40 having N=8 cascaded delay cells 46, predrivers 54, and drivers 58. Each of the cascaded delay cells 46 provide the delay time in accordance with the delay time signal 44. A horizontal axis of each plot indicates time in nanoseconds and a vertical axis of each plot represents volts. A plot 122 shows a family of eight rising edge waveforms 124. Each rising edge waveform is generated at the output port 42 with the cascaded delay cells 46 using a different one of eight discrete delay times. It can be seen from the family of rising edge waveforms 124 that increasing the delay time decreases the slew rate of the output port 42.",

Each falling edge waveform is generated at the output port 42 with the cascaded delay cells using a different one of the eight discrete delay times. It can be seen from the family of rising edge waveforms 124 that decreasing the delay time increases the slew rate of the output port.",
