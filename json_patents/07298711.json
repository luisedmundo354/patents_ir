        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention is generally related to the field of communication devices. More particularly, the present invention is related to echo cancellation in communication devices.",
        "2. Related Art",
        "The increasing demand for high-speed Internet connectivity has in turn increased the demand for various communication devices such as modems, and in particular for modems utilizing digital subscriber line (\u201cDSL\u201d) technology which provides high-speed transmission of voice, video, and data information over existing copper telephone lines. Although the DSL modem is used merely as an example in the present application to illustrate shortcomings of the existing art, such shortcomings and the solutions set forth by the present invention, are also applicable to other communication devices.",
        "DSL technology utilizes a DSL modem to achieve data speed from 128 Kbps to 8 Mbps and higher over an ordinary telephone line. During operation, the DSL modem utilizes the same line for both transmitting and receiving information. As a result, the signal transmitted by a line driver in the DSL modem can encounter discontinuities in the line, which can cause part of the transmitted signal to reflect or echo back and interfere with a received signal. In an effort to eliminate interference to the received signal that is caused by the echo of the signal transmitted by the line driver, DSL modem manufacturers employ echo cancellation circuitry.",
        "To achieve echo cancellation, DSL modem manufacturers typically employ a hybrid circuit comprising analog components. By utilizing a hybrid circuit, an echo reduction or attenuation of approximately 15.0 to 20.0 dB can be achieved. However, proper reception of the received signal requires that the signal strength of the echo be attenuated below the signal strength of the received signal. Thus, since the signal strength of the received signal can be approximately 80.0 dB below the signal strength of the transmitted signal, an echo reduction of 15.0 to 20.0 dB does not provide sufficient echo cancellation for proper reception of the received signal. Greater echo reduction can be achieved in an external hybrid circuit by utilizing very accurate components and very accurately matching the impedance of the line. However, very accurate components are costly and matching the impedance of the line to a required degree of accuracy is difficult to achieve.",
        "To achieve further echo cancellation, DSL modem manufacturers utilize a digital echo canceller (\u201cDEC\u201d) in the DSL modem. By utilizing a DEC, a desirable echo attenuation or reduction of approximately 80.0 dB can be achieved. However, the DEC is essentially a linear echo canceller and, as such, works very well as long as the line driver that transmits the output signal of the DSL modem is linear.",
        "During actual operation, the signal transmitted by the line driver includes non-linear signal components, since linearity is difficult to achieve in a high power and high current device such as a line driver. As a result, the echo will include both linear and non-linear signal components. Thus, since the DEC is essentially a linear echo canceller, the DEC will only cancel the linear component of the echo. Since the hybrid circuit can reduce both the linear and non-linear components of the echo, the hybrid circuit can be utilized to attenuate the non-linear component of the echo. However, the hybrid circuit typically attenuates the non-linear component of the echo by only approximately 15.0 to 20.0 dB. Thus, the unattenuated portion of the non-linear component of the echo will be passed through to the decoder portion of the DSL modem as noise, which can undesirably interfere with reception of low level signals.",
        "Although the DEC could be designed to cancel the non-linear portion of the echo, the complexity of the DEC would be greatly increased, since an exponentially increasing amount of digital circuitry would be required for each harmonic of the non-linear portion of the echo. As a result, the cost of the DEC would be undesirably increased.",
        "Thus, there is a need in the art for a cost-effective system for cancellation of linear and non-linear echo components created by a line driver in a communication device, such as a DSL modem.",
        "The present invention is directed to echo cancellation in a communication device. The present invention addresses and resolves the need in the art for a cost-effective system for cancellation of linear and non-linear echo components created by a line driver in a communication device, such as a DSL modem.",
        "According to one exemplary embodiment, a communication device comprises a line driver or power amplifier, where the line driver or power amplifier provides an output signal. The communication device may be, for example, a DSL modem. The communication device further comprises a digital echo canceller module coupled to the line driver, where the digital echo canceller module receives an echo reference signal determined by the output signal of the line driver, where the echo canceller module outputs an echo cancellation signal, and where the echo cancellation signal is capable of canceling linear and non-linear components of a composite signal.",
        "According to this exemplary embodiment, the communication device further comprises a summation module coupled to the digital echo canceller module, where the summation module receives the echo cancellation signal and the composite signal, and where the composite signal comprises a received signal and the linear and non-linear echo components. The summation module is configured to subtract the echo cancellation signal from the composite signal and to output the received signal. The communication device may further comprise an external hybrid module coupled to the line driver. Other features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art after reviewing the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.",

Moreover, some of the specific details of the invention are not discussed in order not to obscure the invention.",
        "The drawings in the present application and their accompanying detailed description are directed to merely exemplary embodiments of the invention. To maintain brevity, other embodiments of the present invention are not specifically described in the present application and are not specifically illustrated by the present drawings.",
        "FIG. 1 shows a block diagram of an exemplary DSL modem, including a conventional exemplary echo cancellation system, coupled to a line.

Line 104 is utilized by conventional DSL modem 102 to communicate with a telephone company central office and typically comprises copper twisted-pair wire.",
        "Also shown in FIG. 1, first and second inputs of external hybrid module 106 are coupled to nodes 152 and 154 and first and second outputs of external hybrid module 106 are coupled to first \u201c+\u201d and \u201c\u2212\u201dinputs of amplifier 126 via lines 166 and 168, respectively. External hybrid module 106 comprises discrete analog components and can be configured to attenuate linear and non-linear echo components caused by line driver 116.

Further shown in FIG. 1, first and second inputs of equalizer module 124 are coupled to nodes 158 and 160 and first and second outputs of equalizer module 124 are coupled to second \u201c\u2212\u201d and \u201c+\u201d inputs of amplifier 126 via lines 174 and 176, respectively. Equalizer module 124 can be configured to counteract distortions, typically low pass filtering, caused by line 104 in a received signal. Equalizer module 124 is an optional module that is not utilized in some DSL modems.",
        "Further shown in FIG. 1, first and second outputs, respectively, of amplifier 126 are coupled to LPF/AAF module 128 via lines 178 and 180. Amplifier 126 can be an automatic gain control (\u201cAGC\u201d) amplifier that can be configured to appropriately adjust the gain of an inputted signal in a manner known in the art. LPF/AAF module 128 can be configured to prevent \u201caliasing noise\u201d by appropriately filtering first and second outputs received from amplifier 126 via lines 178 and 180, respectively. By way of background, \u201caliasing noise\u201d refers to distortion that is created when frequencies present in a sampled signal are greater than one-half the sample rate.",
        "Also shown in FIG. 1, LPF/AAF module 128 is coupled to ADC module 130 via lines 182 and 183 and ADC module 130 is coupled to decimation filter module 132 via line 184. ADC module 130 can be configured to convert an analog signal inputted on lines 182 and 183 into a digital signal, which can be outputted on line 184. Decimation filter module 132 can be configured to eliminate unnecessary data points caused by over-sampling in ADC module 130. Further shown in FIG. 1, the output of decimation filter module 132 is coupled to summation module 134 via line 186 and the output of DEC module 136 is coupled to summation module 134 via line 188. DEC module 136 can be configured to receive a digital reference signal from encoder module 108 via line 191, process the digital signal, and output the digital signal on line 188 such that the outputted digital signal can cancel linear echo created by line driver 116. DEC module 136 can be, for example, a finite impulse response (\u201cFIR\u201d) filter as known in the art, typically contained in a digital signal processor (\u201cDSP\u201d). Summation module 134 can be configured to subtract the linear echo cancellation signal received from digital echo canceller module 136 from a composite signal received from decimation filter module 132 and to provide an output signal on line 190, which is coupled to a decoder module (not shown in FIG. 1). The composite signal received from decimation filter module 132 includes a received signal and linear and non-linear echo components.",
        "The operation of a conventional exemplary echo cancellation system is now discussed. As discussed above, signals outputted by line driver 116 can produce an echo, which can interfere with reception of signals received over line 104 at nodes 158 and 160. As a result of non-linearity in the operation of line driver 116, the echo includes linear and non-linear components. The linear and non-linear echo components are combined with received signals at nodes 158 and 160, and the resulting composite signals are inputted into amplifier 126 via lines 174 and 176. First and second outputs, respectively, of line driver 116 are coupled to first and second inputs of external hybrid module 106 via nodes 152 and 154. External hybrid module 106 can be configured to match Zline 156, i.e. the impedance of line 104, such that the magnitude and phase of signals on lines 166 and 168, respectively, closely match the magnitude and phase of composite signals on lines 174 and 176.",
        "The signals outputted from hybrid module 106 on lines 166 and 168 are subtracted in amplifier 126 from the composite signals inputted on lines 174 and 176. The resulting composite signals outputted by amplifier 126 on lines 178 and 180 have linear and non-linear echo components that have been attenuated approximately 15.0 dB to 20.0 dB by external hybrid module 106. A composite digital signal is inputted into summation module 134 after processing by LPF/AAF module 128, ADC module 130, and decimation filter module 132. In summation module 134, the output from DEC module 136 on line 188 is subtracted from the composite digital signal, which comprises a receive signal and attenuated linear and non-linear echo components, on line 186, and a resulting signal is outputted on line 190. The output of DEC module 136 can be utilized to cancel only the linear echo component, since DEC module 136 is a linear echo canceller. As a result, the signal outputted on line 190 includes the received signal combined with a non-linear echo component that has been attenuated approximately 15.0 dB to 20.0 dB. In conventional DSL modem 102, the attenuated non-linear echo component is undesirably coupled to a decoder module (not shown in FIG. 1) via line 190 as noise, which can interfere with proper reception of the received signal.",
