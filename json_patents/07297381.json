        "In many backlight display devices, for example in liquid crystal display televisions (LCD TV), there is a demand for larger and larger displays. As the size of a display increases, the number of light sources (e.g., a cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL)) used to backlight the display can also increase. Accordingly, the backlight display system can desirably comprise a light diffusing film (also referred to as a light diffusing sheet, a plate, and the like). Examples of the utility of the light diffusing film includes, but is not limited to, hiding the light and dark pattern that can be created by an array of CCFLs, hiding injection molded patterns or printing on a light guide of the display device, providing uniformity in illumination, and the like.",
        "Accordingly, a continual need exists in the art for improved light diffusing devices, especially those light diffusing films employed in LCD TVs.",
        "Disclosed herein are light diffusing films, methods of making the same, and articles using the same.",
        "In one embodiment, a light diffusing film is formed from a composition comprising: a polycarbonate, phosphite stabilizer, epoxy stabilizer, hindered phenol stabilizer, and light diffusing particles having a refractive index of about 1.3 to about 1.7. The film comprises a hiding power of 0 to about 0.5.",
        "In one embodiment, a method for producing a film comprises combining a polycarbonate, a phosphite stabilizer, an epoxy stabilizer, and light diffusing particles to form a combination, and forming the combination into the film.",

The light diffusing film comprises a polycarbonate, a phosphite stabilizer, an epoxy stabilizer, and light diffusing particles having a refractive index of about 1.3 to about 1.7. The light diffusing film comprises a hiding power of 0 to about 0.5.",
        "The above-described and other features will be appreciated and understood from the following detailed description, drawings, and appended claims.",
        "Refer now to the figures, which are exemplary embodiments, and wherein the like elements are numbered alike.",
        "FIG. 1 is a cross sectional view of a linear array of cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs).",

        "Disclosed herein are optical films, more particularly light diffusing films comprising a polymeric material and light diffusing particles. The polymeric material is a material that, when made into a \u215bth thick bar, the bar has a light transmission of greater than or equal to about 80%. Unless specifically set forth herein otherwise, all transmission is measured in accordance with ASTM D1003-00, procedure B measured with instrument Macbeth 7000A, D65 illuminant, 10\u00b0 observer, CIE (Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage) (1931), and SCI (specular component included), and UVEXC (i.e., the UV component is excluded). Exemplary polymeric materials include polycarbonate, poly(methyl) acrylate, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), as well as combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing, such as methyl methacrylate-styrene (MS) copolymer.",
        "The light diffusing particles can have a refractive index (RI) of about 1.3 to about 1.7 (e.g., silsesquioxanes, acrylics, and so forth, as well as combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing), and/or can have a RI that is based upon the matrix RI. For example the light diffusing particles can have a RI that is greater than or equal to the matrix RI. In another embodiment, the light diffusing particles can have a RI that is \u00b18% of the matrix RI. The light diffusing film can comprise a light transmission of about 45% to about 80%.",
        "As will be explained in greater detail below, it has been discovered that light diffusing films comprising the formulations disclosed herein can have increased luminance and/or improved \u201chiding power\u201d compared to other light diffusing films (e.g., compared to PC1311-50, a polycarbonate light diffusing sheet available from Teijin Chemical Ltd. of Japan), thereby providing a significant commercial advantage. Furthermore, these light diffusing films can be a single, solid, unitary film characterized by the absence of multiple layers.",
        "The present diffusing film can attain low color shift. For example, the color shift of the light diffusing film after 1,000 hour (hr) ultraviolet (UV) accelerated weathering according to ASTM D4674, method 3, is dx of less than or equal to (<) 0.0005, and dy less than or equal to (<) 0.0006. \u201cdx\u201d is the shift in x chromaticity coordinate and \u201cdy\u201d is the shift from y chromaticity coordinate as measured with instrument Macbeth 7000A, D65 illuminant, 10\u00b0 observer, CIE (1931), SCI, and UVEXC.",

For example, the light diffusing film can be employed in any display device (e.g., a backlight display device), such as LCD TVs, laptop computers, instrument displays, and so forth.",
        "The term \u201chiding power\u201d as used herein refers to the ability of light diffusing films to mask the light and dark pattern produced by, for example, a linear array of fluorescent lamps (e.g., cold cathode fluorescent lamps).

By way of example, the terms L (on) and L (off) and CCFL are shown in FIG. 1 in relation to a cross sectional view of an array of CCFLs. Luminance values that are used to calculate hiding power (Li(on) and Lj(off)) are measured along the points on vertical y axis, where x coordinate is equal to 0, where \u201c1\u201d is the length of CCFL lamp as shown in FIG. 1. The average luminance is defined in relation to a 13 points test determined per Video Electronic Standard Association (VESA) flat panel display measurements (FPDM) version 2.",
        "For example, the light diffusing film can comprise a hiding power of 0 to 0.5, more particularly a hiding power of 0 to about 0.3 when calculated by the above described mathematical formula for hiding power and using the 13 points for average luminance measured using a BM-7 Topcon instrument (commercially available from Topcon Corporation, Japan).",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates luminance versus hiding power design space mapped using optical model. PC 1311-60 and PC 1311-50 sheets (commercially available from Teijin Chemical Ltd. of Japan) have 60% and 50% transmission, respectively. The particle concentration in the polycarbonate (PC) is provide in parentheses in parts per hundred by weight (pph), based upon a combined total of PC and light particles of 100 parts. W/laser refers to light collimating texture on the sheet, while delta RI is the difference between particle refractive index and PC refractive index (i.e., 1.586). As can be seen from the graph, the crosslinked PMMA-PS with a particle size of 4 micrometers (\u03bcm), at a concentration of 0.375 to 6.0 pph, had the highest luminance while still attaining the desired hiding power (e.g., 0% to -0.5%).",
        "Referring now to FIG. 3, a cross sectional, exploded view of an exemplary backlight display device generally designated 100 is illustrated. The backlight display device 100 includes multiple components arranged (e.g., stacked) in various combinations depending on the desired application. Generally, the backlight display device 100 can comprise two outer components with varying components disposed between the two outer components. For example, the backlight display device 100 can comprise a liquid crystal display (LCD) 102 defining an outer side closest to a viewer 104 of the backlight display device 100 and a reflective film 106 defining the second outer side. A light source 108 for generating light can be disposed between the LCD 102 and the reflective film 106, wherein the light source 108 can be in physical communication and/or optical communication with the reflective film 106. A light diffusing film 110 can be disposed between the LCD 102 and the reflective film 106 such that the light diffusing film 110 can be in physical communication and/or optical communication with the light source 108. The backlight display device 100 can further include optional films 112, 114 disposed between the light source 108 and the LCD 102. Suitable optional films include, but are not limited to, prismatic films (PFs), light diffusing films, as well as combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing. Additionally, an optional prismatic film 116 can be disposed between the LCD 102 and the light diffusing film 110.",
        "The number and arrangement of additional components (e.g., optional films 112, 114) can vary depending on the desired application. For example, films are envisioned that can act as both a light diffusing film and as a prismatic film, which can reduce the total number of films employed in the backlight display device 100.",
        "The number of light source(s) 108 can vary depending on the desired application and the size of the backlight display device 100. The light source 108 can include any light source suitable to backlight the LCD 102. Suitable light sources include, but are not limited to, fluorescent lamps (e.g., cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs)) and light-emitting diodes.",
        "The reflective film 106 includes a reflective material that is adapted to reflect light and can take many forms (e.g., a planar shape, such as a plate, a sheet, and the like). For example, suitable reflective materials include, but are not limited to, metals (e.g., aluminum, silver, and so forth), metal oxides (e.g., titanium oxide, and so forth), thermoplastic materials (e.g., Spectralon\u00ae commercially available from Labsphere, Inc.), and so forth, as well as combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing, such as titanium oxide pigmented Lexan\u00ae) (commercially available from General Electric Co.), and the like.",
        "The prismatic film 116 can use light-directing structures (e.g., prismatic structures) to direct light along the viewing axis (i.e., normal to the display), which enhances the brightness of the light viewed by the user (e.g., viewer 104) of the display and which allows the system to use less power to create a desired level of on-axis illumination. For example, the prismatic film can include macroscale, microscale, and/or nanoscale surface features (e.g., retroreflective elements, and so forth). Macroscale surface features have a size of approximately 1 millimeter (mm) to about 1 meter (m) or the entire size of the part being formed; i.e. of a size scale easily discerned by the human eye. Microscale surface features have a size of less than or equal to about 1 mm, or, more specifically, greater than 100 nanometers (nm) to about 1 mm. Nanoscale surface features have a size of less than or equal to about 500 nm, or, more specifically, less than or equal to about 100 nm, or, even more specifically, less than or equal to about 20 nm, and yet more specifically, about 0.5 nm to 10 nm. Some possible surface features include various geometries such as cube-corners (e.g., triangular pyramid), trihedral, hemispheres, prisms, ellipses, tetragonal, grooves, channels, and others, as well as combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing. Some possible structures and materials are discussed in U.S. Patent Application No. 2003/0108710 to Coyle et al.",

        "As briefly mentioned above, the light diffusing film can be a solid unitary film characterized by the absence of multiple layers. Advantageously, by making a film that is a unitary structure that does not comprise multiple layers, the overall cost of the light diffusing film can be reduced compared to a film that comprises multiple layers. Additionally, in various embodiments, the light diffusing film can be a solid sheet, which again can reduce the cost of manufacturing compared to a film including multiple layers. Further, a solid sheet light diffusing film can eliminate problems including delamination, lack of adhesion between coextruded layers, coating cracking, and the like that are associated with multiple layer structures (e.g., structures that comprise a substrate layer and an imprinted layer (e.g., co-extruded layer, coating layer, laminated layer, and so forth).",
        "It has also been discovered that extruded films made using powder polycarbonate can aid in imparting the desired properties to the light diffusing film. For example, films made from virgin polycarbonate that has not been heat processed (even processed to make pellets which would heat the polycarbonate, giving it a heat history), have improved whiteness. Polycarbonate powder generally has a YI of about 0.8 to about 1.5, or, more specifically, about 0.9 to about 1.3, while polycarbonate pellets have a higher YI than the powder, generally the YI of the pellets is 1.7-2.7. For example, in making the light diffusing film, polycarbonate powder, the light diffusing particles, and any other additives that may be desired for one particular application, can be mixed and disposed in a hopper of an extruder. The polycarbonate, and optionally the additives, can be melted. The mixture is then extruded to form the sheet. For example, the mixture can be extruded through a slot die and passed through a nip between calendaring rolls to form the desired sheet. If powder with no heat history is used to form the sheet, the polycarbonate in the sheet has only one heat history.",
        "Further, in various embodiments, the light diffusing film may comprise optical brightener(s), but does not comprise any dyes or colorants (i.e., is free of dyes and colorants) to reduce the yellowness index of the film. It has been discovered that dyes and/or colorants can adversely affect luminance (e.g., up to a 10% drop in luminance can be observed when using a color additive).",
        "In one embodiment, the method of making a light diffusing film can comprise mixing a polycarbonate and light diffusing particles to form a mixture, melting the polycarbonate to form a melt, and extruding the melt in the form of a sheet to form the light diffusing film.",
        "The specific processing conditions can vary depending upon the desired sheet composition and/or color. In some embodiments, enhanced whiteness (e.g., reduced change in x and/or y compared to PC 1311-50), can be obtained using an average barrel (extruder) temperature of about 200\u00b0 C. to about 235\u00b0 C., or, more specifically, about 204\u00b0 C. to about 228\u00b0 C., or, even more specifically, about 210\u00b0 C. to about 220\u00b0 C., wherein the average is the average of all of the extruder zones (e.g., see Table 13, the average barrel temperature would be the average of Extr Z1-Extr Z5, or 215\u00b0 C.).",

Further, it is noted that the light diffusing film disclosed herein can be a solid unitary film characterized by the absence of multiple layers, which can advantageously reduce the overall cost and improved reliability of the light diffusing film compared to multi-layer films that are formed by lamination, coating or co-extrusion.",

Hence, it is desirable that as much light as possible pass through the diffuser sheet (i.e. diffuser sheet should have high luminance (brightness)). Balance of these properties, hiding power and luminance, provides superior performance. A diffuser film comprising light diffusing particles having a refractive index (RI) of about 1.50 to about 1.55 (e.g., crosslinked PMMA-PS particles) and a particle diameter of about 2 \u03bcm to about 5 \u03bcm, enables such a balance, providing unexpectedly enhanced luminance while retaining hiding power.",

Furthermore, all ranges disclosed herein are inclusive and combinable (e.g., ranges of \u201cup to about 25 weight percent (wt %), with about 5 wt % to about 20 wt % desired, and about 10 wt % to about 15 wt % more desired,\u201d is inclusive of the endpoints and all intermediate values of the ranges, e.g., \u201cabout 5 wt % to about 25 wt %, about 5 wt % to about 15 wt %,\u201d etc.). The suffix \u201c(s)\u201d as used herein is intended to include both the singular and the plural of the term that it modifies, thereby including at least one of that term (e.g., the colorant(s) includes at least one colorants). Compounds are described using standard nomenclature. For example, any position not substituted by any indicated group is understood to have its valency filled by a bond as indicated, or a hydrogen atom. A dash (\u201c\u2014\u201d) that is not between two letters or symbols is used to indicate a point of attachment for a substituent. For example, \u2014CHO is attached through carbon of the carbonyl group. As used herein, particle size is an average size as measured along the major axis (i.e., the longest axis) of the particle.",
        "While the invention has been described with reference to several embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiments disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this invention, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims."
