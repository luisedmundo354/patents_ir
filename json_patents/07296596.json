    "abstract": "The water mixing single handle faucet fitted with a water inlet and outlet includes circular groove, located on the first baffle plate to accommodate the valve core, a valve core location hole, cold water inlet, hot water inlet and water outlet mounted onto the first baffle plate. The cold water inlet is connected to a cold water inlet pipe, hot water inlet connected to hot water inlet pipe, and water outlet connected to water outlet pipe on the main body. The water outlet is located nearby outflow side of the faucet while cold/hot water inlet is located at the remote side. The present invention can thus ensure an easier machining and moulding of bar copper in order to promote the rate of finished products and minimize the manufacturing cost.",

        "The present invention relates generally to a single handle water mixing faucet.",
        "Currently, a single handle water mixing faucet is widely applied because of its ease-of-operation. However, since cold/hot water inlet is located at a frontal section and water outlet at rear section of baffle plate of the faucet (e.g. T-shaped faucet), it will likely make it difficult for moulding of baffle plate, where air pockets will be easily formed, thus leading to a higher degree of defects and manufacturing cost. Besides, considering that cold/hot water inlet is located at frontal section and bar copper is applied to machine-shaping of column faucet, pipe column of water inlet is vulnerable to puncture during machining of water outlet tube orifice, causing serious concern to a higher defective rate.",
        "Thus, to overcome the aforementioned problems of the prior art single handle water mixing faucet, it would be an advancement in the art to provide an improved one of desirable performance.",
        "To this end, the present invention is directed to an improved structure of water mixing single handle faucet fitted with a water inlet and outlet, which can ensure an easier machining and moulding of bar copper in order to promote the rate of finished products and minimize the manufacturing cost.",
        "The enhanced efficacy of the present invention is as follows: owing to the fact that water outlet 33 on the first baffle plate 11 is located nearby outflow side of the faucet while cold/hot water inlet 31, 32 is located at the remote side, \u201cT\u201d-shaped faucet could be placed on \u201cY\u201d-shaped second 12, third 13 and fourth baffle plate 14 in a horizontal plane (as shown in FIG. 1), and used to separate cold/hot water inlet pipe 41 42 and outlet pipe 43 for a more convenient moulding. In the case of column faucet (as shown in FIG. 2), cold/hot water inlet's pipe column will not be punctured during machining by bar copper, thereby promoting efficiently the rate of finished products and reducing considerably the manufacturing cost for a higher availability.",
        "Although the invention has been explained in relation to its preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that many other possible modifications and variations can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.",
        "FIG. 1 shows a schematic view of the structure of the first embodiment of the present invention.",
        "FIG. 2 shows another schematic view of the structure of the second embodiment of the present invention.",
        "The features and the advantages of the present invention will be more readily understood upon a thoughtful deliberation of the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1, the present invention has offered a preferred embodiment of water mixing single handle faucet (e.g. a T-shaped faucet) fitted with an improved water inlet and outlet. A circular groove, located on the first baffle plate 11 to accommodate the valve core, comprises a valve core location hole 2, cold water inlet 31, hot water inlet 32 and water outlet 33 mounted onto the first baffle plate 11. Among them, cold water inlet is connected to cold water inlet pipe 41, hot water inlet connected to hot water inlet pipe 42, and water outlet 33 connected to water outlet pipe 43 on the main body. Moreover, the water outlet 33 is located nearby outflow side of the faucet while cold/hot water inlet is located at the remote side.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1, the faucet is fitted with a second 12, third 13 and fourth baffle plate 14 in a \u201cY\u201d-shaped configuration, of which the second baffle plate 12 is placed between cold water inlet pipe 41 and hot water inlet pipe 42, the third baffle plate 13 placed between cold water inlet pipe 41 and water outlet pipe 43, and the fourth baffle plate 14 placed between hot water inlet pipe 42 and water outlet pipe 43. The inner ends of second, third and fourth baffle plates are tightly bonded, while the outer ends are separately sealed into inner wall of faucet body, such that the first baffle plate 11 is tightly covered onto the second, third and fourth baffle plates.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2, the second preferred embodiment of the present invention is represented by a column faucet. A circular groove, located on the first baffle plate 11 to accommodate the valve core, comprises a valve core location hole 2, cold water inlet 31, hot water inlet 32 and water outlet 33 mounted onto the first baffle plate 11. Among them, cold water inlet 31 is connected to cold water inlet pipe 41, hot water inlet 32 connected to hot water inlet pipe 42, and water outlet 33 connected to water outlet pipe 43 on the main body. And, the water outlet 33 is located nearby outflow side of the faucet while cold/hot water inlet is located at the remote side.",
        "The cold water inlet pipe 41 is fixedly connected to cold water inlet 31 on the first baffle plate, while hot water inlet pipe 42 is fixedly connected to hot water inlet 32 on the first baffle plate."
