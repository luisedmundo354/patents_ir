        "This application claims the priority benefit of Japan application serial no. JP2004-088926, filed on Mar. 25, 2004.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an underwater weighing container and an underwater weighing container unit for receiving a weight of a solid specimen immersed in a reference liquid and a buoyant force exerted thereon. The present invention also relates to an apparatus for measuring a specific gravity of the solid specimen.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Generally, the commonly employed method for determining a specific gravity of a solid specimen without knowledge of its volume is to weigh the solid specimen in air, measure a weight of the solid specimen immersed in a reference liquid or a buoyant force exerted thereon, and use the obtained values for calculating the relevant specific gravity based on the following equation (1):\n\nSpecific Gravity=Weight in Air/(Weight in Air\u2212Weight in Liquid)=Weight in Air/Buoyant Force\u2003\u2003Equation (1)",
        "As will be exemplified hereinafter, methods of weighing a solid specimen both in air and in a reference liquid, or measuring a weight of the solid specimen in air and a buoyant force produced by the solid specimen, for calculation of the relevant specific gravity have been applied to a number of conventional apparatus for measuring specific gravity. One such example is a specific gravity measuring apparatus 5A in FIG. 8, wherein a solid specimen 2 is first hung and suspended in air and then placed inside a liquid bath 3 to measure its weight by means of an electronic weighing scale 7, for determining the specific gravity. As shown in FIG. 9, another conventional specific gravity measuring apparatus 5B has an underwater weighing container 1A arranged on an electronic weighing scale 7, allowing the underwater weighing container 1A to mount a solid specimen 2 thereon in a liquid bath 3B. With this configuration, after the underwater weighing container 1A holding the solid specimen 2 is subjected to measurement, the corresponding tare weight is subtracted from the obtained weight to determine specific gravity of the solid specimen 2. The patent literatures pertaining to these apparatuses for measuring specific gravity are Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Publication Nos. H11-230885 and 2002-243615.",
        "The aforementioned configurations are employed in the conventional specific gravity measuring apparatus and the underwater weighing containers. However, the method of hanging and suspending the solid specimen 2 as shown in FIG. 8 is troublesome, due to the need to replace and suspend the solid specimen 2 having different shapes. In the method of providing the underwater weighing container 1A for measuring the weight of the solid specimen 2, as shown in FIG. 9, the solid specimen 2, if its specific gravity is lower than that of a reference liquid, will be floating. As representative measures to prevent the solid specimen 2 from floating, a sinker frame 8 as shown in FIG. 9, or a lid (not illustrated) may be placed in a reference liquid L. If any such measure is to be implemented, users will be required to insert and remove the sinker frame 8 or to open and close the lid, whenever conducting weight measurement. This method, as illustrated in FIG. 8, is inconvenient for users. Depending on whether the solid specimen 2 sinks or floats in the reference liquid L, users will be required to employ a different configuration of the underwater weighing container 1A. This can increase users' work load for maintenance and management of the apparatus for measuring specific gravity. The amount of the reference liquid L used for the measurement process also increases.",
        "In consideration of the situation presented heretofore, the present invention is provided. An object of the present invention is to provide an underwater weighing container and a specific gravity measuring apparatus using the same, which can be applied to a solid specimen that may be heavier or lighter than the reference liquid. In addition, the underwater weighing container and the specific gravity measuring apparatus are compact and require relatively a small amount of reference liquid used for the weight measurement.",
        "In order to accomplish the aforementioned object, the present invention provides an underwater weighing container, equipped with a bottom plate movable both upwardly and downwardly within a given range. Furthermore, the bottom plate is designed to hold a solid specimen on the upper surface thereof and carry its weight thereon if the specific gravity of the solid specimen is higher than that of a reference liquid, or to place the solid specimen underneath the bottom plate for a buoyant force of the specimen to be exerted against the bottom plate if the specific gravity of the solid specimen is lower than that of the liquid.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, the present invention further provides an underwater weighing container unit, comprises an underwater weighing container being arranged at a lower position, a bottom plate capable of moving both upward and downward in a given range, an aerial weighing container arranged at an upper position to carry the weight of a solid specimen in air, and coupling rods to couple with the underwater weighing container and the aerial weighing container.",
        "Furthermore, apparatus for measuring specific gravity of the present invention comprises the underwater weighing container unit of the present invention, a frame supporting the underwater weighing container unit, and a weight measuring unit, the frame being placed on the weight measuring unit to determine the specific gravity of a solid specimen.",
        "An underwater weighing container, an underwater weighing container unit and apparatus for measuring specific gravity according to the present invention have the aforementioned configurations, wherein a bottom plate of the underwater weighing container are movable so as to place and hold a solid specimen inside whenever the solid specimen is subjected to measurement in a reference liquid.",
        "For this reason, they occupy a relatively small space and enable users to effectively reduce the amount of reference liquid used for the measurement process.",
        "In an underwater weighing container, an underwater weighing container unit and apparatus for measuring specific gravity according to the present invention, the underwater weighing container is equipped with a movable bottom plate. If a solid specimen is heavier than a reference liquid, the solid specimen is placed on the bottom plate and moved downward with the associated bottom plate by their gravity. If the solid specimen is lighter than the reference liquid, the solid specimen is inserted underneath the bottom plate and moved upward with the associated bottom plate by the specimen's buoyant force. Consequently the solid specimen remains inside the underwater weighing container in any case. Thus, it is possible to reduce the size of underwater weighing container, underwater weighing container unit, apparatus for measuring specific gravity, and a liquid bath used therein, and also to reduce the amount of reference liquids used for measurement.",

In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be obvious, however, to those skilled in art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instance, well-known configurations are not shown in detail in order to avoid unnecessary obscurity of the present invention.",
        "FIGS. 1A and 1B show a structure of an underwater weighing container 1 according to one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 1A shows a front elevation view of the underwater weighing container 1, while FIG. 1B shows a cross-sectional side elevation view thereof.",
        "The underwater weighing container 1 comprises a metallic tubular body 11 having openings on both ends, wherein one end of the openings has a circular rim 11a produced through such processes as bending and/or welding and the other end of the opening has four stoppers 11b on the internal surface, wherein the four stoppers are arranged with each fixed at 90 degrees from the central axis of the tubular body 11 . The underwater weighing container 1 further comprises a circular metallic bottom plate 12 having a mesh or a porous structure and being inserted between the circular rim 11a and the stoppers 11b; and a metallic hanging member 13 being attachable to the upper part of the tubular body 11 for hanging and suspending the tubular body 11. The bottom plate 12 is basically configured in contact with the circular rim 11a. When a buoyant force that is greater than the weight of the bottom plate 12 is exerted to the bottom plate 12 from underneath, the bottom plate 12 can move upward until it reaches where the stoppers 11b are installed.",
        "FIGS. 2A and 2B show cross-sectional front elevation views of the underwater weighing container 1 holding a solid specimen 2. FIG. 2A shows a condition that the specific gravity of the solid specimen 2 is larger than that of a reference liquid L, and FIG. 2B shows the other condition where the specific gravity of the solid specimen 2 is smaller than that of the reference liquid L. A method of measuring specific gravity of the solid specimen 2 by using the underwater weighing container 1 is described hereinafter with reference to FIGS. 2A and 2B.",
        "First, while the underwater weighing container 1 is submerged in a liquid bath 3, a weighing apparatus (not shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B) such as a scale, together with a hanging member 13 is employed, to measure the weight (W0) of the underwater weighing container 1 per se. If the solid specimen 2 is heavier than the reference liquid L, the solid specimen 2 is placed on the bottom plate 12 as shown in FIG. 2A, and at which time the weight W1 of the underwater weighing container 1 with the solid specimen 2 is measured. If the weight of the solid specimen 2 measured in air is Wa, the specific gravity S of the solid specimen 2 can be calculated based on the following equation (2).\n\nS=Wa/(Wa\u2212(W1\u2212W0))\u2003\u2003Equation (2)",
        "If the specific gravity of the solid specimen 2 is smaller than that of the reference liquid L, the underwater weighing container 1 is lifted to insert the solid specimen 2 underneath the bottom plate 12 as shown in FIG. 2B. Due to the buoyant force produced thereby, the solid specimen 2 is in contact with the bottom plate 12, and moves upward together with the bottom plate 12 until the solid specimen 2 remain stationary and stable. Under this condition, the weight (W2) of the underwater weighing container 1 is determined. Accordingly, the specific gravity S of the solid specimen 2 can be calculated based on the following equation (3).\n\nS=Wa/(W0\u2212W2)\u2003\u2003Equation (3)",
        "FIGS. 3A and 3B show a structure of an underwater weighing container unit 4 according to another embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 3A shows a partial cross-sectional front elevation view of the underwater weighing container unit 4, and FIG. 3B shows a plan view thereof. The underwater weighing container unit 4 comprises the underwater weighing container 1 arranged in a lower position; an aerial weighing container 41 being a circular container made either of metal or resin, arranged in an upper position; coupling rods 42 coupling with the underwater weighing container 1 and the aerial weighing container 41; and a hanging member 43 attached to the aerial weighing container 41. Based on this configuration, a solid specimen can be solid received in the aerial weighing container 41 to measure its weight in air, and the solid specimen can be placed on or underneath the bottom plate 12, so that the weight of the solid specimen immersed in a reference liquid or the buoyant force exerted thereon can be weighted.",
        "FIG. 4 is a partially cross-sectional front elevation view of the underwater weighing container unit 4, wherein solid specimens 2A, 2B and 2C are received in the liquid bath 3. The disposition of the solid specimen 2A in FIG. 4 represents a position designated for measuring its weight in air. The disposition of the solid specimen 2B represents a position designated for measuring its weight in the reference liquid L, wherein the solid specimen 2B is placed on the bottom plate 12 and submerged in the reference liquid L if the specific gravity of the solid specimen 2B is larger than that of the reference liquid L. The disposition of the solid specimen 2C represents a position designated for measuring its buoyant force in the reference liquid L, wherein the solid specimen 2C is inserted underneath the bottom plate 12 and submerged in the reference liquid L if the specific gravity of the solid specimen 2C is smaller than that of the reference liquid L. A method of measuring the specific gravities of the solid specimens 2A, 2B and 2C respectively by means of the underwater weighing container unit 4 is described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 4.",
        "First, while only the underwater weighing container unit 4 is dipped and immersed in the liquid bath 3, a weight measuring apparatus (not shown in FIG. 4) such as a scale, together with a hanging member 43, is employed to measure the weight W0 of the underwater weighing container unit 4 per se. The solid specimen 2A is arranged on the underwater weighing container unit 4, at which time the weight W1 of the underwater weighing container unit 4 is measured. If the solid specimen is heavier than the reference liquid L, the solid specimen is placed in the designated position as shown by the solid specimen 2B of FIG. 4, and under this condition, the weight W2 of the underwater weighing container unit 4 with the solid specimen 2B is measured. Hence, the specific gravity S of the solid specimen 2B can be calculated based on the following equation (4).\n\nS=(W1\u2212W0)/(W1\u2212W2)\u2003\u2003Equation (4)",
        "If the solid specimen is lighter than the reference liquid L, the underwater weighing container unit 4 is lifted to insert the solid specimen underneath the bottom plate 12, as indicated by the solid specimen 2C in FIG. 4. With the buoyant force produced thereby, the solid specimen 2C floats, makes contact with the bottom plate 12, moves upward together with the bottom plate 12 until reaching up to the locations of the stoppers 11b. The solid specimen 2C then remains stationary and stable. Under this condition, the weight W3 of the underwater weighing container unit 4 with the solid specimen 2C is measured. Therefore, the specific gravity S of the solid specimen 2C can be calculated based on the following equation (5).\n\nS=(W1\u2212W0)/(W0\u2212W3)\u2003\u2003Equation (5)",
