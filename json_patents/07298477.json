        "The invention generally relates to methods, instrumentation and devices for detecting biomolecular interactions.",
        "With the completion of the sequencing of the human genome, one of the next grand challenges of molecular biology will be to understand how the many protein targets encoded by DNA interact with other proteins, small molecule pharmaceutical candidates, and a large host of enzymes and inhibitors. See e.g., Pandey & Mann, \u201cProteomics to study genes and genomes,\u201d Nature, 405, p. 837\u2013846, 2000; Leigh Anderson et al., \u201cProteomics: applications in basic and applied biology,\u201d Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 11, p. 408-412, 2000; Patterson, \u201cProteomics: the industrialization of protein chemistry,\u201d Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 11, p. 413-418, 2000; MacBeath & Schreiber, \u201cPrinting Proteins as Microarrays for High-Throughput Function Determination,\u201d Science, 289, p. 1760-1763, 2000; De Wildt et al., \u201cAntibody arrays for high-throughput screening of antibody-antigen interactions,\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 18, p. 989-994, 2000. To this end, tools that have the ability to simultaneously quantify many different biomolecular interactions with high sensitivity will find application in pharmaceutical discovery, proteomics, and diagnostics. Further, for these tools to find widespread use, they must be simple to use, inexpensive to own and operate, and applicable to a wide range of analytes that can include, for example, polynucleotides, peptides, small proteins, antibodies, and even entire cells.",
        "Biosensors have been developed to detect a variety of biomolecular complexes including oligonucleotides, antibody-antigen interactions, hormone-receptor interactions, and enzyme-substrate interactions. In general, biosensors consist of two components: a highly specific recognition element and a transducer that converts the molecular recognition event into a quantifiable signal. Signal transduction has been accomplished by many methods, including fluorescence, interferometry (Jenison et al., \u201cInterference-based detection of nucleic acid targets on optically coated silicon.\u201d Nature Biotechnology, 19, p. 62-65; Lin et al., \u201cA porous silicon-based optical interferometric biosensor,\u201d Science, 278, p. 840-843, 1997), and gravimetry (A. Cunningham, Bioanalytical Sensors, John Wiley & Sons (1998)).",
        "Of the optically-based transduction methods, direct methods that do not require labeling of analytes with fluorescent compounds are of interest due to the relative assay simplicity and ability to study the interaction of small molecules and proteins that are not readily labeled. Direct optical methods include surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Jordan & Corn, \u201cSurface Plasmon Resonance Imaging Measurements of Electrostatic Biopolymer Adsorption onto Chemically Modified Gold Surfaces, \u201d Anal. Chem., 69:1449-1456 (1997), (grating couplers (Morhard et al., \u201cImmobilization of antibodies in micropatterns for cell detection by optical diffraction,\u201d Sensors and Actuators B, 70, p. 232-242, 2000), ellipsometry (Jin et al., \u201cA biosensor concept based on imaging ellipsometry for visualization of biomolecular interactions,\u201d Analytical Biochemistry, 232, p. 69-72, 1995), evanascent wave devices (Huber et al., \u201cDirect optical immunosensing (sensitivity and selectivity),\u201d Sensors and Actuators B, 6, p. 122-126, 1992), and reflectometry (Brecht & Gauglitz, \u201cOptical probes and transducers,\u201d Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 10, p. 923-936, 1995). Theoretically predicted detection limits of these detection methods have been determined and experimentally confirmed to be feasible down to diagnostically relevant concentration ranges. However, to date, these methods have yet to yield commercially available high-throughput instruments that can perform high sensitivity assays without any type of label in a format that is readily compatible with the microtiter plate-based or microarray-based infrastructure that is most often used for high-throughput biomolecular interaction analysis. Therefore, there is a need in the art for composition and methods that can achieve these goals.",

A spectrometer determines spectra of the reflected signal from the biosensor.",
        "In an alternative arrangement, a biosensor imaging system comprises a light source generating white light. A collimator collimates the white light onto a surface of a biosensor.

The method includes the steps of incubating the biosensor at a predetermined temperature and providing a plurality of dual fiber optic probes. Other steps include providing each dual fiber optical probe with an illuminating fiber that is coupled to a light source. The illuminating fiber illuminating light towards a reflective surface of the biosensor. Each fiber is optically coupled to a separate light source and each dual fiber optic probe is provided with a detecting fiber that detects light reflected from the reflective surface. The detecting fiber is optically coupled to a spectrometer where the reflected light is processed.",
        "Unlike surface plasmon resonance, resonant mirrors, and waveguide biosensors, the described compositions and methods enable many thousands of individual binding reactions to take place simultaneously upon the biosensor surface. This technology is useful in applications where large numbers of biomolecular interactions are measured in parallel, particularly when molecular labels alter or inhibit the functionality of the molecules under study. High-throughput screening of pharmaceutical compound libraries with protein targets, and microarray screening of protein-protein interactions for proteomics are examples of applications that require the sensitivity and throughput afforded by this approach. A biosensor of the invention can be manufactured, for example, in large areas using a plastic embossing process, and thus can be inexpensively incorporated into common disposable laboratory assay platforms such as microtiter plates and microarray slides.",

        "The colorimetric resonant optical biosensor allows biochemical interactions to be measured on the sensor's surface without the use of fluorescent tags or colorimetric labels. The sensor surface contains an optical structure that, when illuminated with collimated white light, is designed to reflect only a narrow band of wavelengths. The narrow wavelength is described as a wavelength \u201cpeak.\u201d The \u201cpeak wavelength value\u201d (PWV) changes when biological material is deposited or removed from the sensor surface.",
        "A disclosed measurement instrument performs a number of functions, in addition to detection of a peak wavelength value. For example, the instrument can incubate a microtiter plate incorporating the biosensor plate at a user determined temperature. The instrument may also provide a mechanism for mixing samples within the microtiter plate wells while the microtiter plate resides within the instrument.",
        "In one possible embodiment, the instrument illuminates the biosensor surface by directing a collimated white light on to the sensor structure. The illuminated light may take the form of a spot of collimated light. Alternatively, the light is generated in the form of a fan beam.",
        "The instrument collects light reflected from the illuminated biosensor surface. The instrument may gather this reflected light from multiple locations on the biosensor surface simultaneously. The instrument can include a plurality of illumination probes that direct the light to a discrete number of positions across the biosensor surface. The instrument measures the Peak Wavelength Values (PWVs) of separate locations within the biosensor-embedded microtiter plate using a spectrometer. In one embodiment, the spectrometer is a single-point spectrometer. Alternatively, an imaging spectrometer is used.",
        "The spectrometer produces a PWV image map of the sensor surface. In one embodiment, the measuring instrument spatially resolves PWV images with less than 200 micron resolution.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, a subwavelength structured surface (SWS) may be used to create a sharp optical resonant reflection at a particular wavelength that can be used to track with high sensitivity the interaction of biological materials, such as specific binding substances or binding partners or both. A colorimetric resonant diffractive grating surface acts as a surface binding platform for specific binding substances.",
        "Subwavelength structured surfaces are an unconventional type of diffractive optic that can mimic the effect of thin-film coatings. (Peng & Morris, \u201cResonant scattering from two-dimensional gratings,\u201d J. Opt. Soc. Am. A, Vol. 13, No. 5, p. 993, May; Magnusson, & Wang, \u201cNew principle for optical filters,\u201d Appl. Phys. Lett., 61, No. 9, p. 1022, August, 1992; Peng & Morris, \u201cExperimental demonstration of resonant anomalies in diffraction from two-dimensional gratings,\u201d Optics Letters, Vol. 21, No. 8, p. 549, April, 1996). A SWS structure contains a surface-relief, two-dimensional grating in which the grating period is small compared to the wavelength of incident light so that no diffractive orders other than the reflected and transmitted zeroth orders are allowed to propagate. A SWS surface narrowband filter can comprise a two-dimensional grating sandwiched between a substrate layer and a cover layer that fills the grating grooves. Optionally, a cover layer is not used. When the effective index of refraction of the grating region is greater than the substrate or the cover layer, a waveguide is created.",
        "When a filter is designed according to one aspect of the present invention, incident light passes into the waveguide region. A two-dimensional grating structure selectively couples light at a narrow band of wavelengths into the waveguide. The light propagates only a short distance (on the order of 10-100 micrometers), undergoes scattering, and couples with the forward- and backward-propagating zeroth-order light. This sensitive coupling condition can produce a resonant grating effect on the reflected radiation spectrum, resulting in a narrow band of reflected or transmitted wavelengths. The depth and period of the two-dimensional grating are less than the wavelength of the resonant grating effect.",
        "The reflected or transmitted color of this structure can be modulated by the addition of molecules such as specific binding substances or binding partners or both to the upper surface of the cover layer or the two-dimensional grating surface. The added molecules increase the optical path length of incident radiation through the structure, and thus modify the wavelength at which maximum reflectance or transmittance will occur.",
        "In one embodiment, a biosensor, when illuminated with white light, is designed to reflect only a single wavelength. When specific binding substances are attached to the surface of the biosensor, the reflected wavelength (color) is shifted due to the change of the optical path of light that is coupled into the grating. By linking specific binding substances to a biosensor surface, complementary binding partner molecules can be detected without the use of any kind of fluorescent probe or particle label. The detection technique is capable of resolving changes of, for example, \u02dc0.1 nm thickness of protein binding, and can be performed with the biosensor surface either immersed in fluid or dried. A more detailed description of these binding partners is provided in related and commonly assigned patent application Ser. No. 09/930,352, herein entirely incorporated by reference and to which the reader is directed for further information.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, a detection system consists of, for example, a light source that illuminates a small spot of a biosensor at normal incidence through, for example, a fiber optic probe. A spectrometer collects the reflected light through, for example, a second fiber optic probe also at normal incidence. Because no physical contact occurs between the excitation/detection system and the biosensor surface, no special coupling prisms are required. The biosensor can, therefore, be adapted to a commonly used assay platform including, for example, microtiter plates and microarray slides. A spectrometer reading can be performed in several milliseconds, thus it is possible to efficiently measure a large number of molecular interactions taking place in parallel upon a biosensor surface, and to monitor reaction kinetics in real time.",
        "This technology is useful in applications where large numbers of biomolecular interactions are measured in parallel, particularly when molecular labels would alter or inhibit the functionality of the molecules under study. High-throughput screening of pharmaceutical compound libraries with protein targets, and microarray screening of protein-protein interactions for proteomics are examples of applications that require the sensitivity and throughput afforded by the compositions and methods of the invention.",
        "A schematic diagram of an example of a SWS structure 10 is shown in FIG. 1. In FIG. 1, nsubstrate represents a refractive index of a substrate material 12. n1 represents the refractive index of an optional cover layer 14. n2 represents the refractive index of a two-dimensional grating 16.

In one embodiment, n2>n1 (see FIG. 1). Layer thicknesses (i.e. cover layer 14, one or more specific binding substances 20, or a two-dimensional grating 16) are selected to achieve resonant wavelength sensitivity to additional molecules on a top surface 15. A grating period is selected to achieve resonance at a desired wavelength.",
        "One embodiment provides a SWS biosensor, such as the SWS biosensor 10 illustrated in FIG. 1. The SWS biosensor 10 comprises a two-dimensional grating 16 and a substrate layer 12 that supports the two-dimensional grating 16. One or more specific binding substances 20 may be immobilized on a surface 15 of the two-dimensional grating 16 opposite of the substrate layer 12. Incident light 11 is polarized perpendicular to the grating structure and results in the reflected light 13. FIG. 1B illustrates a perspective view of the optical grating structure illustrated in FIG. 1A. Note that a SWS biosensor works equally well whether illumination and reflection occur from the top of the sensor surface or from the bottom, although FIG. 1 illustrates only the bottom illumination and reflection case.",
        "The two-dimensional grating 16 can comprise a material, including, for example, zinc sulfide, titanium dioxide, tantalum oxide, and silicon nitride. A cross-sectional profile of a two-dimensional grating can comprise any periodically repeating function, for example, a \u201csquare-wave.\u201d The two-dimensional grating can comprise a repeating pattern of shapes selected from the group consisting of lines, squares, circles, ellipses, triangles, trapezoids, sinusoidal waves, ovals, rectangles, and hexagons. A sinusoidal cross-sectional profile is preferable for manufacturing applications that require embossing of a grating shape into a soft material such as plastic. In one embodiment of the biosensor, the depth of the grating is about 0.01 micron to about 1 micron and the period of the grating is about 0.01 micron to about 1 micron.",
        "Linear gratings have resonant characteristics where the illuminating light polarization is oriented perpendicular to the grating period. However, a hexagonal grid of holes has increased polarization symmetry over that of a rectangular grid of holes. Therefore, a colorimetric resonant reflection biosensor can comprise, for example, a hexagonal array of holes or alternatively, a grid of parallel lines. FIG. 3B illustrates a 2-D biosensor grating 34 including a grid of circular holes 36. FIG. 3A illustrates a 2-D biosensor grating 30 including a grid of squares/rectangles 32.",
        "A linear grating has the same pitch (i.e. distance between regions of high and low refractive index), period, layer thicknesses, and material properties as the hexagonal array grating. However, light must be polarized perpendicular to the grating lines in order to be resonantly coupled into the optical structure. Therefore, a polarizing filter oriented with its polarization axis perpendicular to the linear grating is inserted between the illumination source and the biosensor surface. Because only a small portion of the illuminating light source is correctly polarized, a longer integration time is required to collect an equivalent amount of resonantly reflected light compared to a hexagonal grating.",
        "While a linear grating can require either a higher intensity illumination source or a longer measurement integration time compared to a hexagonal grating, the fabrication requirements for the linear structure are generally less complex. A hexagonal grating pattern is produced by holographic exposure of photoresist to three mutually interfering laser beams. The three beams are aligned in order to produce a grating pattern that is essentially symmetrical in three directions. A linear grating pattern requires alignment of only two laser beams to produce a holographic exposure in photoresist, and therefore has a reduced alignment requirement. A linear grating pattern can also be produced by, for example, direct writing of photoresist with an electron beam. Also, several commercially available sources exist for producing linear grating \u201cmaster\u201d templates for embossing a grating structure into plastic.",
        "A schematic diagram of a linear grating structure 24 is shown in FIG. 2. The grating structure 24 includes a grating fill layer 25, a grating structural layer 26, and a substrate 27. Incident light 28 is polarized perpendicular to the grating structure and results in the reflected light 29.",
        "A rectangular grid pattern can be produced in photoresist using an electron beam direct-write exposure system. A single wafer can be illuminated as a linear grating with two sequential exposures with the part rotated 90-degrees between exposures.",
        "FIG. 5(a) illustrates a two-dimensional grating 50. Two-dimensional grating 50 comprises a \u201cstepped\u201d profile 52. In such a stepped profile 52, the profile has high refractive index regions of a single, fixed height embedded within a lower refractive index cover layer. The alternating regions of high and low refractive index provide an optical waveguide parallel to a top surface of the biosensor.",
        "For manufacture, a stepped structure, such as the structure illustrated in FIG. 5(a), is etched or embossed into a substrate material 54 such as glass or plastic. A uniform thin film of higher refractive index material 51, such as silicon nitride (SiN) or zinc sulfide (ZnS) is deposited on this structure. The deposited layer follows the contour of the embossed or etched structure in the substrate 54. Consequently, the deposited material 51 has a surface relief profile that is essentially identical to the original embossed or etched profile of embossed plastic substrate 54.",
        "The structure 50 can be completed with an application of an optional cover layer 56. Preferably, cover layer 56 includes a material having a lower refractive index than the higher refractive index material and has a substantially flat upper surface 57. The covering material 56 can be, for example, glass, epoxy, or plastic.",
        "A stepped structure, such as the structure illustrated in FIG. 5(a), allows for reduced cost biosensor manufacturing, because the biosensor can be mass produced. For example, a \u201cmaster\u201d grating can be produced in glass, plastic, or metal using a three-beam laster holographic patterning process. See e.g., Cowan, The recording and large scale production of crossed holographic grating assays using multiple beam interferometry. Proc. Soc. Photo-optical Instum. Eng. 503:120 (1984). A master grating can be repeatedly used to emboss a plastic substrate. The embossed substrate 50 is subsequently coated with a high refractive index material and optionally, a cover layer 56.",
        "While a stepped structure poses essentially few manufacturing complications, it is also possible to make a resonant biosensor in which a high refractive index material is not stepped. Rather, a biosensor could include a high refractive index material that varies with lateral position. For example, FIG. 4 illustrates an alternative embodiment of a biosensor 40. In this embodiment, the biosensor 40 includes a two-dimensional grating 42 having a high refractive index material varying with lateral positions.",
        "The biosensor 40 includes a substrate layer 41 that supports the two-dimensional grating 42. One or more specific binding substances 46 may be immobilized on a surface 43 of the two-dimensional grating opposite of the substrate layer 41. Sensor 40 includes a profile in which a high refractive index material of the two-dimensional grating 42, n2, sinusoidally varies in height. This varying height of the two-dimensional grating 42 is represented by t2.",
        "To produce a resonant reflection at a particular wavelength, the period of the sinusoidally varying grating 42 is essentially identical to the period of an equivalent stepped structure. The resonant operation of the sinusoidally varying structure 40 and its functionality as a biosensor has been verified using GSOLVER (Grating Solver Development Company, Allen, Tex., USA) computer models.",
        "Techniques for making two-dimensional gratings are disclosed in Wang, J. Opt. Soc. Am No. 8, August 1990, pp. 1529-44. Biosensors as herein described can be made in, for example, a semiconductor microfabrication facility. Biosensors can also be made on a plastic substrate using continuous embossing and optical coating processes. For this type of manufacturing process, a \u201cmaster\u201d structure is built in a rigid material such as glass or silicon. These \u201cmaster\u201d structures are used to generate \u201cmother\u201d structures in an epoxy or plastic using one of several types of replication procedures. The \u201cmother\u201d structure, in turn, is coated with a thin film of conductive material, and used as a mold to electroplate a thick film of nickel. The nickel \u201cdaughter\u201d is released from the plastic \u201cmother\u201d structure. Finally, the nickel \u201cdaughter\u201d is bonded to a cylindrical drum, which is used to continuously emboss the surface relief structure into a plastic film.",
        "A device structure that uses an embossed plastic substrate is shown in FIG. 5(a). Following embossing, the plastic substrate 54 is overcoated with a thin film of high refractive index material 51. The substrate 54 may be optionally coated with a planarizing, cover layer polymer, and cut to appropriate size.",
        "In one biosensor embodiment, a substrate for a SWS biosensor comprises glass, plastic or epoxy. Alternatively, a substrate and a two-dimensional grating comprise a single biosensor unit. That is, a two dimensional grating and substrate are formed from the same material, such as, for example, glass, plastic, or epoxy. The surface of a single unit comprising the two-dimensional grating is coated with a material having a high refractive index, for example, zinc sulfide, titanium dioxide, tantalum oxide, and silicon nitride. One or more specific binding substances can be immobilized on the surface of the material having a high refractive index or on an optional cover layer.",
        "An alternative biosensor embodiment can further comprise a cover layer on the surface of a two-dimensional grating opposite of a substrate layer. Where a cover layer is present, the one or more specific binding substances are immobilized on the surface of the cover layer opposite of the two-dimensional grating. Preferably, a cover layer comprises a material that has a lower refractive index than a material that comprises the two-dimensional grating. A cover layer can be comprised of, for example, glass (including spin-on glass (SOG)), epoxy, or plastic.",
        "Various polymers that meet the refractive index requirement of a biosensor can be used for a cover layer. For example, SOG can be used due to its favorable refractive index, ease of handling, and readiness of being activated with specific binding substances using a number of known glass surface activation techniques. When the flatness of the biosensor surface is not an issue for a particular application, a grating structure of SiN/glass can directly be used as the sensing surface, the activation of which can be done using the same means as on a glass surface.",
        "Resonant reflection can also be obtained without a planarizing cover layer over a two-dimensional grating. For example, a biosensor can contain only a substrate coated with a structured thin film layer of high refractive index material. Without the use of a planarizing cover layer, the surrounding medium (such as air or water) fills the grating. Therefore, specific binding substances are immobilized to the biosensor on all surfaces a two-dimensional grating exposed to the specific binding substances, rather than only on an upper surface.",
        "According to an alternative embodiment, a biosensor is illuminated with white light that contains light of every polarization angle. The orientation of the polarization angle with respect to repeating features in a biosensor grating determines a resonance wavelength. For example, a \u201clinear grating\u201d biosensor structure consisting of a set of repeating lines and spaces will have two optical polarizations that can generate separate resonant reflections. Light that is polarized perpendicularly to the lines is referred to as \u201cs-polarized,\u201d whereas light that is polarized parallel to the lines is referred to as \u201cp-polarized.\u201d Both the s and the p components of incident light exist simultaneously in an unfiltered illumination beam, and each component generates a separate resonant signal. A biosensor structure can generally be designed to optimize the properties of only one polarization (the s-polarization), and the non-optimized polarization can be removed by a polarizing filter.",
        "In order to remove the polarization dependence, so that every polarization angle generates the same resonant reflection spectra, an alternate biosensor structure can be used. Such an alternative biosensor could consist of a plurality of concentric rings, such as the structure illustrated in FIG. 5(b). In this structure, the difference between an inside diameter and an outside diameter of each concentric ring is equal to about one-half of a grating period. Each successive ring has an inside diameter that is about one grating period greater than the inside diameter of the previous ring. The concentric ring pattern extends to cover a single sensor location\u2014such as a microarray spot or a microtiter plate well. Each separate microarray spot or microtiter plate well has a separate concentric ring pattern centered within it.",
        "All polarization directions of such a structure have the same cross-sectional profile. The concentric ring structure, such as the structure illustrated in FIG. 5(b), should be illuminated on-center to preserve polarization independence. The grating period of a concentric ring structure is preferably less than the wavelength of the resonantly reflected light. In one preferred embodiment, the grating period is about 0.01 micron to about 1 micron and the grating depth is about 0.01 to about 1 micron.",
        "In another biosensor embodiment, an array of holes or posts are provided on a sensor surface, such as the design illustrated in FIG. 5(c). Preferably, the array of holes or posts are arranged to approximate the concentric circle structure described above without requiring the illumination beam to be centered upon any particular location of the grid. Such an array pattern is automatically generated by the optical interference of three laser beams incident on a surface from three directions at equal angles. In this pattern, the holes (or posts) are centered upon the corners of an array of closely packed hexagons, as illustrated in FIG. 5(c). The holes or posts also occur in the center of each hexagon. Such a hexagonal grid of holes or posts has three polarization directions that \u201csee\u201d the same cross-sectional profile. The hexagonal grid structure, therefore, provides equivalent resonant reflection spectra using light of any polarization angle. Thus, no polarizing filter is required to remove unwanted reflected signal components. The period of the holes or posts can be about 0.01 microns to about 1 micron and the depth or height can be about 0.01 microns to about 1 micron. These and various other grid structures are disclosed and described in commonly assigned co-pending patent application Ser. No. 09/930,352 herein entirely incorporated by reference and to which the reader is directed for further details.",
        "One possible detection apparatus and method provides for resonant reflection structures and transmission filter structures comprising concentric circle gratings and hexagonal grids of holes or posts. For a resonant reflection structure, light output is measured on the same side of the structure as the illuminating light beam. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 2, reflected light 29 is measured on the same side of the structure 21 as the illuminating light beam or incident light 28.",
        "For a transmission filter structure, light output is measured on the opposite side of the structure as the illuminating beam. The reflected and transmitted signals are complementary. That is, if a wavelength is strongly reflected, it is weakly transmitted. Assuming no energy is absorbed in the structure itself, the combined reflected energy and transmitted energy at a given wavelength will remain a constant. The resonant reflection structure and transmission filters are designed to provide an efficient reflection at a specified wavelength. Therefore, a reflection filter will \u201cpass\u201d a narrow band of wavelengths, while a transmission filter will filter out or \u201ccut\u201d a narrow band of wavelengths from incident light.",
        "A resonant reflection structure or a transmission filter structure can comprise a two-dimensional grating arranged in a pattern of concentric circles. (See, e.g., FIG. 5(b). A resonant reflection structure or transmission filter structure can also comprise a hexagonal grid of holes or posts. (See, e.g., FIG. 5(c)).",
        "When these structures are illuminated with an illuminating light beam, a reflected radiation spectrum is produced. Such a radiation spectrum is independent of an illumination polarization angle of the illuminating light beam. A resonant grating effect is produced on the reflected radiation spectrum, wherein the depth and period of the two-dimensional grating or hexagonal grid of holes or posts are less than the wavelength of the resonant grating effect. These structures reflect a narrow band of light when the structure is illuminated with a broadband of light.",
        "Resonant reflection structures and transmission filter structures of the invention can be used as biosensors. For example, one or more specific binding substances can be immobilized on the hexagonal grid of holes or posts or on the two-dimensional grating arranged in concentric circles.",
        "In an alternative embodiment, a reference resonant signal is provided for more accurate measurement of peak resonant wavelength shifts. The reference resonant signal can cancel out environmental effects, including, for example, temperature or other types of unwanted noise. A reference signal can be provided using a resonant reflection superstructure that produces two separate resonant wavelengths. For example, FIG. 6A illustrates a transparent resonant reflection superstructure arrangement 60. Transparent resonant reflection superstructure 60 contains two sub-structures. The sub-structures comprise a low n cured polymer 66 and a high n dielectric 67. A first sub-structure comprises a first two-dimensional grating 62 with a top 61a and a bottom surface 61b. The top surface of a two-dimensional grating 61a comprises the grating surface 63. The first two-dimensional grating can comprise one or more specific binding substances immobilized on its top surface. The top surface of the first two-dimensional grating 63 will be in contact with a test sample (not shown). An optional substrate layer 64 may provide support to the bottom surface 61b of the first two-dimensional grating. The substrate layer 64 comprises a top 65a and bottom surface 65b. The top surface 65a of the substrate 64 is in contact with, and supports the bottom surface 61b of the first two-dimensional grating 62. A low n substrate 68 is also provided.",
        "A second sub-structure 70, illustrated in FIG. 6B, comprises a second two-dimensional grating 72 with a top surface 73a and a bottom surface 73b. The second two-dimensional grating is not in contact with a test sample. The sub-structures comprise a low n cured polymer 77 and a high n dielectric 71. The second two-dimensional grating can be fabricated onto a bottom surface of the substrate 74 that supports a first two-dimensional grating 76. Where the second two-dimensional grating is fabricated on the substrate that supports the first two-dimensional grating, the bottom surface 73a of the second two-dimensional grating 72 can be fabricated onto the bottom surface 75 of the substrate 74. Therefore, the top surface 73b of the second two-dimensional grating 72 will face the opposite direction of a surface 77a of the first two-dimensional grating 76.",
        "The top surface 73b of the second two-dimensional grating 72 can also be attached directly to the bottom surface of the first sub-structure. In this arrangement, the top surface of the second two-dimensional grating would face in the same direction as the top surface 77a of the first two-dimensional grating 76. A substrate 74 can support the bottom surface of the second two-dimensional grating in this arrangement.",
        "Because the second sub-structure is not in physical contact with the test sample, its peak resonant wavelength is not subject to changes in the optical density of the test media, or deposition of specific binding substances or binding partners on the surface of the first two-dimensional grating. Therefore, such a superstructure produces two resonant signals. Because the location of the peak resonant wavelength in the second sub-structure is fixed, the difference in peak resonant wavelength between the two sub-structures provides a relative means for determining the amount of specific binding substances or binding partners or both deposited on the top surface of the first substructure that is exposed to the test sample.",
        "A biosensor superstructure can be illuminated from its top surface or from its bottom surface, or from both surfaces. The peak resonance reflection wavelength of the first substructure is dependent on the optical density of material in contact with the superstructure surface. The peak resonance reflection wavelength of the second substructure is independent of the optical density of material in contact with the superstructure surface.",
        "In an alternative embodiment, a biosensor is illuminated from a bottom surface. Approximately 50% of the incident light is reflected from the bottom surface of biosensor without reaching the active (or the top) surface of the biosensor. A thin film or physical structure can be included in a biosensor composition that is capable of maximizing the amount of light that is transmitted to the upper surface of the biosensor while minimizing the reflected energy at the resonant wavelength. The anti-reflection thin film or physical structure of the bottom surface of the biosensor can comprise, for example, a single dielectric thin film, or a stack of multiple dielectric thin films.",
        "Alternatively, a \u201cmotheye\u201d structure embossed into the bottom biosensor surface is provided. An example of a motheye structure is disclosed in Hobbs, et al. \u201cAutomated interference lithography system for generation of sub-micron feature size patterns,\u201d Proc. 1999 Micromachine Technology for Diffracting and Holographic Optics, Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers, p. 124-135, (1999).",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, an interaction of a first molecule with a second test molecule is detected. A SWS biosensor as previously described is used. However, there are no specific binding substances immobilized on a SWS biosensor. Therefore, the biosensor comprises a two-dimensional grating, a substrate layer that supports the two-dimensional grating. Optionally, a cover layer may be provided. As described above, when the biosensor is illuminated a resonant grating effect is produced on the reflected radiation spectrum, and the depth and period of the two-dimensional grating are less than the wavelength of the resonant grating effect.",
        "To detect an interaction of a first molecule with a second test molecule, a mixture of the first and second molecules is applied to a distinct location on a biosensor. Such a location may be one area, spot, or one well on the biosensor. Alternatively, it could be a large area on the biosensor. A mixture of the first molecule with a third control molecule is also applied to a distinct location on a biosensor. The biosensor can be the same biosensor as described above, or can be a second biosensor. If the biosensor is the same biosensor, a second distinct location can be used for the mixture of the first molecule and the third control molecule.",
        "Alternatively, the same distinct biosensor location can be used after the first and second molecules are washed from the biosensor. The third control molecule does not interact with the first molecule and may be about the same size as the first molecule. A shift in the reflected wavelength of light from the distinct locations of the biosensor or biosensors is measured using a read out method and apparatus as detailed below.",
        "If the shift in the reflected wavelength of light from the distinct location having the first molecule and the second test molecule is greater than the shift in the reflected wavelength from the distinct location having the first molecule and the third control molecule, then the first molecule and the second test molecule interact. Interaction can be, for example, hybridization of nucleic acid molecules, specific binding of an antibody or antibody fragment to an antigen, and binding of polypeptides. A first molecule, second test molecule, or third control molecule can be, for example, a nucleic acid, polypeptide, antigen, polyclonal antibody, monoclonal antibody, single chain antibody (scFv), F(ab) fragment, F(ab\u2032)2 fragment, Fv fragment, small organic molecule, cell, virus, and bacteria.",
        "One or more specific binding substances may be immobilized on the two-dimensional grating or cover layer, if present. Immobilization may occur by physical adsorption or by chemical binding. A specific binding substance can be, for example, a nucleic acid, polypeptide, antigen, polyclonal antibody, monoclonal antibody, single chain antibody (scFv), F(ab) fragment, F(ab\u2032)2 fragment, Fv fragment, small organic molecule, cell, virus, bacteria, or biological sample. A biological sample can be for example, blood, plasma, serum, gastrointestinal secretions, homogenates of tissues or tumors, synovial fluid, feces, saliva, sputum, cyst fluid, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, lung lavage fluid, semen, lymphatic fluid, tears, or prostatic fluid.",
        "Preferably, one or more specific binding substances are arranged in a microarray of distinct locations on a biosensor. A microarray of specific binding substances comprises one or more specific binding substances on a surface of a biosensor such that a biosensor surface contains a plurality of distinct locations, each with a different specific binding substance or with a different amount of a specific binding substance. For example, an array can comprise 1, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, or 100,000 distinct locations. A biosensor surface with a large number of distinct locations is called a microarray because one or more specific binding substances are typically laid out in a regular grid pattern in x-y coordinates. However, a microarray can comprise one or more specific binding substances laid out in a regular or irregular pattern. For example, distinct locations can define a microarray of spots of one or more specific binding substances.",
        "A microarray spot can range from about 50 to about 500 microns in diameter. Alternatively, a microarray spot can range from about 150 to about 200 microns in diameter. One or more specific binding substances can be bound to their specific binding partners.",
        "In one biosensor embodiment, a microarray on a biosensor is created by placing microdroplets of one or more specific binding substances onto, for example, an x-y grid of locations on a two-dimensional grating or cover layer surface. When the biosensor is exposed to a test sample comprising one or more binding partners, the binding partners will be preferentially attracted to distinct locations on the microarray that comprise specific binding substances that have high affinity for the binding partners. Some of the distinct locations will gather binding partners onto their surface, while other locations will not.",
        "A specific binding substance specifically binds to a binding partner that is added to the surface of a biosensor of the invention. A specific binding substance specifically binds to its binding partner, but does not substantially bind other binding partners added to the surface of a biosensor. For example, where the specific binding substance is an antibody and its binding partner is a particular antigen, the antibody specifically binds to the particular antigen, but does not substantially bind other antigens. A binding partner can be, for example, a nucleic acid, polypeptide, antigen, polyclonal antibody, monoclonal antibody, single chain antibody (scFv), F(ab) fragment, F(ab\u2032)2 fragment, Fv fragment, small organic molecule, cell, virus, bacteria, and biological sample. A biological sample can be, for example, blood, plasma, serum, gastrointestinal secretions, homogenates of tissues or tumors, synovial fluid, feces, saliva, sputum, cyst fluid, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, lung lavage fluid, semen, lymphatic fluid, tears, and prostatic fluid.",
        "In an alternative embodiment, a nucleic acid microarray is provided, in which each distinct location within the array contains a different nucleic acid molecule. In this embodiment, the spots within the nucleic acid microarray detect complementary chemical binding with an opposing strand of a nucleic acid in a test sample.",
        "While microtiter plates are a common format used for biochemical assays, microarrays are increasingly seen as a means for increasing the number of biochemical interactions that can be measured at one time while minimizing the volume of precious reagents. By application of specific binding substances with a microarray spotter onto a biosensor of the invention, specific binding substance densities of 10,000 specific binding substances/in2 can be obtained. By focusing an illumination beam of a fiber optic probe to interrogate a single microarray location, a biosensor can be used as a label-free microarray readout system.",
        "Immobilization of one or more binding substances onto a biosensor is performed so that a specific binding substance will not be washed away by rinsing procedures, and so that its binding to binding partners in a test sample is unimpeded by the biosensor surface. Several different types of surface chemistry strategies have been implemented for covalent attachment of specific binding substances to, for example, glass for use in various types of microarrays and biosensors. These methods can be adapted to a biosensor embodiment. Surface preparation of a biosensor so that it contains certain required functional groups for binding one or more specific binding substances can be an integral part of the biosensor manufacturing process.",
        "One or more specific binding substances can be attached to a biosensor surface by physical adsorption (i.e., without the use of chemical linkers). Alternatively, one or more specific binding substances can be attached to a biosensor surface by chemical binding (i.e., with the use of chemical linkers). Chemical binding can generate stronger attachment of specific binding substances on a biosensor surface. Chemical binding also provides defined orientation and conformation of the surface-bound molecules. Several examples of chemical binding of specific binding substances to a biosensor embodying one aspect of the invention are described in detail in related commonly assigned co-pending patent application Ser. No. 09/930,352 herein entirely incorporated by reference and to which the reader is directed for further detail.",
        "Other types of chemical binding include, for example, amine activation, aldehyde activation, and nickel activation. These surfaces can be used to attach several different types of chemical linkers to a biosensor surface. While an amine surface can be used to attach several types of linker molecules, an aldehyde surface can be used to bind proteins directly, without an additional linker. A nickel surface can be used to bind molecules that have an incorporated histidine (\u201chis\u201d) tag. Detection of \u201chis-tagged\u201d molecules with a nickel-activated surface is well known in the art (Whitesides, Anal. Chem. 68, 490, (1996)).",
        "Immobilization of specific binding substances to plastic, epoxy, or high refractive index material can be performed essentially as described for immobilization to glass. However, an acid wash step may be eliminated where such a treatment would damage the material to which the specific binding substances are immobilized.",
        "For the detection of binding partners at concentrations of less than about \u02dc0.1 ng/ml, one may amplify and transduce binding partners bound to a biosensor into an additional layer on the biosensor surface. The increased mass deposited on the biosensor can be detected as a consequence of increased optical path length. By incorporating greater mass onto a biosensor surface, an optical density of binding partners on the surface is also increased, thus rendering a greater resonant wavelength shift than would occur without the added mass. The addition of mass can be accomplished, for example, enzymatically, through a \u201csandwich\u201d assay, or by direct application of mass to the biosensor surface in the form of appropriately conjugated beads or polymers of various size and composition. This principle has been exploited for other types of optical biosensors to demonstrate sensitivity increases over 1500\u00d7 beyond sensitivity limits achieved without mass amplification.

        "In an alternative embodiment, a biosensor comprises volume surface-relief volume diffractive structures (a SRVD biosensor). SRVD biosensors have a surface that reflects predominantly at a particular narrow band of optical wavelengths when illuminated with a broad band of optical wavelengths. Where specific binding substances and/or binding partners are immobilized on a SRVD biosensor, the reflected wavelength of light is shifted. One-dimensional surfaces, such as thin film interference filters and Bragg reflectors, can select a narrow range of reflected or transmitted wavelengths from a broadband excitation source. However, the deposition of additional material, such as specific binding substances and/or binding partners onto their upper surface results only in a change in the resonance linewidth, rather than the resonance wavelength. In contrast, SRVD biosensors have the ability to alter the reflected wavelength with the addition of material, such as specific binding substances and/or binding partners to the surface.",

The depth and period of relief volume diffraction structures are less than the resonance wavelength of light reflected from a biosensor.",
        "A three-dimensional surface-relief volume diffractive grating can be, for example, a three-dimensional phase-quantized terraced surface relief pattern whose groove pattern resembles a stepped pyramid. When such a grating is illuminated by a beam of broadband radiation, light will be coherently reflected from the equally spaced terraces at a wavelength given by twice the step spacing times the index of refraction of the surrounding medium. Light of a given wavelength is resonantly diffracted or reflected from the steps that are a half-wavelength apart, and with a bandwidth that is inversely proportional to the number of steps. The reflected or diffracted color can be controlled by the deposition of a dielectric layer so that a new wavelength is selected, depending on the index of refraction of the coating.",
        "A stepped-phase structure can be produced first in photoresist by coherently exposing a thin photoresist film to three laser beams, as described previously.

Imaging Sci. 31, 100-107, 1987. The nonlinear etching characteristics of photoresist are used to develop the exposed film to create a three-dimensional relief pattern. The photoresist structure is then replicated using standard embossing pattern. For example, a thin silver film may be deposited over the photoresist structure to form a conducting layer upon which a thick film of nickel can be electroplated. The nickel \u201cmaster\u201d plate is then used to emboss directly into a plastic film, such as vinyl, that has been softened by heating or solvent.",

Each inverted pyramid is approximately 1 micron in diameter. Preferably, each inverted pyramid can be about 0.5 to about 5 microns diameter, including for example, about 1 micron. The pyramid structures can be close-packed so that a typical microarray spot with a diameter of 150-200 microns can incorporate several hundred stepped pyramid structures. The relief volume diffraction structures have a period of about 0.1 to about 1 micron and a depth of about 0.1 to about 1 micron.",

The first microarray spot 82 is not provided with an adsorbed material while the second microarray spot 84 is provided with an adsorbed protein. Consequently, the index or refraction for the first spot remains unchanged, i.e., nair=1. The index of refraction for the second spot will change to that of an absorbed protein, i.e., nprotein=1.4.",
        "As white light 81 is illuminated onto the first microarray spot 84, blue light 89 will be reflected. Alternatively, the reflected light of white light 88 illuminated unto the second microarray spot 86 will be different (i.e., green light 87) because of the different index of refraction.",
        "FIG. 6 demonstrates how individual microarray locations (with an entire microarray spot incorporating hundreds of pyramids now represented by a single pyramid for one microarray spot) can be optically queried to determine if specific binding substances or binding partners are adsorbed onto the surface. When the structure is illuminated with white light, structures without significant bound material will reflect wavelengths determined by the step height of the structure. When higher refractive index material, such as binding partners or specific binding substances, are incorporated over the reflective metal surface, the reflected wavelength is modified to shift toward longer wavelengths. The color that is reflected from the terraced step structure is theoretically given as twice the step height times the index of refraction of a reflective material that is coated onto the first surface of a sheet material of a SRVD biosensor. A reflective material can be, for example silver, aluminum, or gold.",

A plurality of individual grating structures, represented in FIG. 7 by small circles, such as small circle 91, lie within each microarray spot. The microarray spots, represented by the larger circles 92(a-i), reflect white light at a specific wavelength. This specific wavelength is determined by the refractive index of material on the microarray surface. Microarray locations with additional adsorbed material will have reflected wavelengths that are shifted toward longer wavelengths, represented by the larger circles.",
        "Because the reflected wavelength of light from a SRVD biosensor is confined to a narrow bandwidth, very small changes in the optical characteristics of the surface manifest themselves in easily observed changes in reflected wavelength spectra. The narrow reflection bandwidth provides a surface adsorption sensitivity advantage compared to reflectance spectrometry on a flat surface.",
        "A SRVD biosensor reflects light predominantly at a first single optical wavelength when illuminated with a broad band of optical wavelengths, and reflects light at a second single optical wavelength when one or more specific binding substances are immobilized on the reflective surface. The reflection at the second optical wavelength results from optical interference. A SRVD biosensor also reflects light at a third single optical wavelength when the one or more specific binding substances are bound to their respective binding partners, due to optical interference.",
        "Readout of the reflected color can be performed serially by focusing a microscope objective onto individual microarray spots and reading the reflected spectrum with the aid of a spectrograph or imaging spectrometer, or in parallel by, for example, projecting the reflected image of the microarray onto an imaging spectrometer incorporating a high resolution color CCD camera.",
        "A SRVD biosensor can be manufactured by, for example, producing a metal master plate, and stamping a relief volume diffractive structure into, for example, a plastic material like vinyl. After stamping, the surface is made reflective by blanket deposition of, for example, a thin metal film such as gold, silver, or aluminum. Compared to MEMS-based biosensors that rely upon photolithography, etching, and wafer bonding procedures, the manufacture of a SRVD biosensor is very inexpensive.",
        "A SWS or SRVD biosensor embodiment can comprise an inner surface. In one preferred embodiment, such an inner surface is a bottom surface of a liquid-containing vessel. A liquid-containing vessel can be, for example, a microtiter plate well, a test tube, a petri dish, or a microfluidic channel. In one embodiment, a SWS or SRVD biosensor is incorporated into a microtiter plate.",
        "For example, a SWS biosensor or SRVD biosensor can be incorporated into the bottom surface of a microtiter plate by assembling the walls of the reaction vessels over the resonant reflection surface, so that each reaction \u201cspot\u201d can be exposed to a distinct test sample. Therefore, each individual microtiter plate well can act as a separate reaction vessel. Separate chemical reactions can, therefore, occur within adjacent wells without intermixing reaction fluids and chemically distinct test solutions can be applied to individual wells.",
        "Several methods for attaching a biosensor of the invention to the bottom surface of bottomless microtiter plates can be used, including, for example, adhesive attachment, ultrasonic welding, and laser welding.",
        "The most common assay formats for pharmaceutical screening laboratories, molecular biology research laboratories, and diagnostic assay laboratories are microtiter plates. The plates are standard-sized plastic cartridges that can contain 96, 384, or 1536 individual reaction vessels arranged in a grid. Due to the standard mechanical configuration of these plates, liquid dispensing, robotic plate handling, and detection systems are designed to work with this common format. A biosensor incorporating an embodiment of the present invention can be incorporated into the bottom surface of a standard microtiter plate. See, e.g., FIGS. 8A & 8B.",
        "For example, FIG. 8A illustrates a microtiter plate 93. The microtiter plate 93 is a bottomless microtiter plate having a plurality of holes 93 (a). The plurality of holes, preferably arranged in an array, extend from a top surface 96 to a bottom surface 95 of the microtiter plate 93. A microarray slide 94 (FIG. 8B) is provided along the plate bottom surface 95. The slide acts as a resonant reflection biosensor surface due to the incorporation of structure in the bottom surface in accordance with FIG. 4 or 5, described previously.",
        "Because the biosensor service can be fabricated in large areas, and because a readout system incorporating one aspect of the present invention does not make physical contact with the biosensor surface, a plurality of individual biosensor areas can be defined.",
        "A number of biosensors that are, for example, about 1 mm2 to about 5 mm2, and preferably less than about 3\u00d73 mm2 can be arranged onto a holding fixture that can simultaneously dip the biosensors into separate liquid-containing vessels, such as wells of a microtiter plate, for example, a 96-, 384-, or 1536-well microtiter plate. Other types of liquid containing vessels could also be used including a micro fluidic device, a microarray chip, a petri dish, a microscope slide, and a flask.",
        "FIG. 9 illustrates an embodiment of a holding fixture 100. Fixture 100 includes a plurality of wells 104. In this embodiment, the fixture includes 96 wells arranged in an array comprising 8 rows and 12 columns. Each well 104 includes a plurality of microtiter plate spots 102. Where, for example, the biosensor includes 96 wells, a total of 4800 plate spots are provided.\n\n(4800=96\u00d750)\n\nTherefore, with the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 9, this holding fixture 100 could be dipped into a 96-well plate and perform 4800 assays.",
        "Each of the biosensors can contain multiple distinct locations. A holding fixture has one or more attached biosensors so that each individual biosensor can be lowered into a separate, liquid-containing vessel. A holding fixture can comprise plastic, epoxy or metal. For example, 50, 96, 384, or 1,000, or 1536 biosensors can be arranged on a holding fixture, where each biosensor has 25, 100, 50, or 1,000 distinct locations. As an example, where 96 biosensors are attached to a holding fixture and each biosensor comprises 100 distinct locations, 3600 biochemical assays can be simultaneously performed.",
        "The disclosed SWS and SRVD biosensors can be used to study one or a number of specific binding substance/binding partner interactions in parallel. Binding of one or more specific binding substances to their respective binding partners can be detected, without the use of labels. Detection occurs by applying one or more binding partners to a SWS or SRVD biosensor that have one or more specific binding substances immobilized on their surfaces. A SWS biosensor is illuminated with light and a maxima in reflected wavelength, alternatively or a minima in transmitted wavelength is detected from the biosensor. If one or more specific binding substances have bound to their respective binding partners, then the reflected wavelength of light is shifted as compared to a situation where one or more specific binding substances have not bound to their respective binding partners. The shift is detected by a spectrographic device as described in further detail. Where a SWS biosensor biosensor is coated with an array of distinct locations containing the one or more specific binding substances, then a maxima in reflected wavelength or minima in transmitted wavelength of light is detected from each distinct location of the biosensor.",
        "A SRVD biosensor is illuminated with light after binding partners have been added and the reflected wavelength of light is detected from the biosensor. Where one or more specific binding substances have bound to their respective binding partners, the reflected wavelength of light is shifted.",
        "In an alternative embodiment, a variety of specific binding substances, for example, antibodies, can be immobilized in an array format onto a biosensor of the invention. The biosensor is contacted with a test sample of interest comprising binding partners, such as proteins. Only the proteins that specifically bind to the antibodies immobilized on the biosensor remain bound to the biosensor. Such an approach is essentially a large-scale version of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. However, in this embodiment, the use of an enzyme or fluorescent label is not required.",
        "The activity of an enzyme can be detected by applying one or more enzymes to a SWS or SRVD biosensor to which one or more specific binding substances have been immobilized. The biosensor is washed and illuminated with light. The reflected wavelength of light is detected from the biosensor. Where the one or more enzymes have altered the one or more specific binding substances of the biosensor by enzymatic activity, the reflected wavelength of light is shifted.",
        "Additionally, a test sample, for example, cell lysates containing binding partners can be applied to a biosensor of the invention, followed by washing to remove unbound material. The binding partners that bind to a biosensor can be eluted from the biosensor and identified by, for example, mass spectrometry. Optionally, a phage DNA display library can be applied to a biosensor of the invention followed by washing to remove unbound material. Individual phage particles bound to the biosensor can be isolated and the inserts in these phage particles can then be sequenced to determine the identity of the binding partner.",
        "For the above applications, and in particular proteomics applications, the ability to selectively bind material, such as binding partners from a test sample onto a preferred biosensor, followed by the ability to selectively remove bound material from a distinct location of the biosensor for further analysis is advantageous. Biosensors may also be capable of detecting and quantifying the amount of a binding partner from a sample that is bound to a biosensor array distinct location by measuring the shift in reflected wavelength of light. For example, the wavelength shift at one distinct biosensor location can be compared to positive and negative controls at other distinct biosensor locations to determine the amount of a binding partner that is bound to a biosensor array distinct location.",
        "An alternative biosensor embodiment structure is provided that enables a biosensor array to selectively attract or repel binding partners from individual distinct locations on a biosensor. As is well known in the art, an electromotive force can be applied to biological molecules such as nucleic acids and amino acids subjecting them to an electric field. Because these molecules are electronegative, they are attracted to a positively charged electrode and repelled by a negatively charged electrode.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, a grating structure of a resonant optical biosensor is provided with an electrically conducting material rather than an electrically insulating material. An electric field is applied near the biosensor surface. Where a grating operates as both a resonant reflector biosensor and as an electrode, the grating comprises a material that is both optically transparent near the resonant wavelength, and also has low resistivity. In one biosensor embodiment, the material is indium tin oxide, InSnxO1-x(ITO). ITO is commonly used to produce transparent electrodes for flat panel optical displays, and is therefore readily available at low cost on large glass sheets. The refractive index of ITO can be adjusted by controlling x, the fraction of Sn that is present in the material. Because the liquid test sample solution has mobile ions (and will therefore be an electrical conductor), the ITO electrodes are coated with an insulating material. In a preferred resonant optical biosensor embodiment, a grating layer is coated with a layer with lower refractive index material. Materials such as cured photoresist (n=1.65), cured optical epoxy (n=1.5), and glass (n=1.4-1.5) are strong electrical insulators that also have a refractive index that is lower than ITO (n=2.0-2.65). A cross-sectional diagram of a biosensor that incorporates an ITO grating is shown in FIG. 16.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 16, n1 represents the refractive index of an electrical insulator 222. n2 represents the refractive index of a two-dimensional grating 224. t1 represents the thickness of the electrical insulator 222. t2 represents the thickness of the two-dimensional grating 224. nbio represents the refractive index of one or more specific binding substances 228 and tBIO represents the thickness of the one or more specific binding substances 228.",
        "A grating can be a continuous sheet of ITO contains an array of regularly spaced holes. The holes are filled in with an electrically insulating material, such as cured photoresist. The electrically insulating layer overcoats the ITO grating so that the upper surface of the structure is completely covered with electrical insulator, and so that the upper surface is substantially flat. When the biosensor 220 is illuminated with light 230, a resonant grating effect is produced on the reflected radiation spectrum 225. The depth and the period of the grating 224 are less than the wavelength of the resonant grating effect.",
        "A single electrode can comprise a region containing a plurality of grating periods. For example, FIG. 10 illustrates an embodiment of an array of biosensor electrodes 110. In this preferred embodiment, the array of biosensor electrodes 110 includes 9 grating periods 112 (a-i). Providing a plurality of separate grating regions 112 (a-i) on a single substrate surface creates an array of biosensor electrodes. Electrical contact to regions 112(a-i) is provided using electrically conducting traces 114 (a-i). Traces 114 (a-i) are preferably constructed from the same material as a conductor within the biosensor electrode 110. Conducting traces 114 (a-i) are coupled to a voltage source 115.

A \u201ccommon\u201d electrode 122 can be placed within the sample liquid 130. A voltage from source 123 can be applied between one selected biosensor electrode region 125 and the common electrode. In this manner, one, several, or all electrodes may be activated or inactivated simultaneously. FIG. 12(b) illustrates the attraction of electronegative molecules 144 to the biosensor surface when a positive voltage is applied to the electrode. FIG. 12(c) illustrates the application of a repelling force such as a reversed electrical charge to electronegative molecules 144 using a negative electrode voltage 123(b).",
        "FIG. 13 illustrates one embodiment of a detection system 150. The detection system 150 comprises a biosensor 152 having the structure as previously herein described, e.g., as in FIG. 4. The detection system 150 further includes a light source 154 and spectrometer 160. The light source 154 directs light to the biosensor 152. A detector, such as the spectrometer 160, detects light reflected via a collecting fiber 153 from the biosensor.",
        "The light source 154 illuminates the biosensor 151 via an illuminating fiber 152 from a sensor top surface, i.e., the surface to which one or more specific binding substances are immobilized. Alternatively, the biosensor 152 may be illuminated from its bottom surface. By measuring the shift in resonant wavelength at each distinct location of the biosensor 152, it is possible to determine which distinct locations have binding partners bound to them. The extent of the shift can be used to determine the amount of binding partners in a test sample and the chemical affinity between one or more specific binding substances and the binding partners of the test sample.",
        "In one embodiment, the biosensor 152 is illuminated twice. A first reflected measurement determines the reflectance spectra of one or more distinct locations of a biosensor array with one or more specific binding substances immobilized on the biosensor. A second measurement determines the reflectance spectra after one or more binding partners are applied to a biosensor. The difference in peak wavelength between these two measurements is a measurement of the amount of binding partners that have specifically bound to a biosensor or one or more distinct locations of a biosensor. This method of illumination can account for small nonuniformities in a surface of a biosensor, resulting in regions with slight variations in the peak resonant wavelength. This method can detect varying concentrations or molecular weights of specific binding substances immobilized on a biosensor.",
        "Computer simulation can be used to determine the expected dependence between a peak resonance wavelength and an angle of incident illumination. For example, referring to FIG. 1, substrate 12 may be chosen as glass (nsubstrate=1.50). The grating 16 could be a two-dimensional pattern of silicon nitride squares (t2180 nm, n2=2.01 (n=refractive index), k2=0.001 (k=absorption coefficient) with a period of 510 nm, and a filling factor of 56.2% (i.e., 56.2% of the surface is covered with silicon nitride squares while the rest is the area between the squares). The areas between silicon nitride squares may be filled with a lower refractive index material. The same material covers the squares and provides a uniformly flat upper surface. In this embodiment, a glass layer may be selected (n1=1.40) such that it covers the silicon nitride squares by t2=100 nm.",
        "The reflected intensity as a function of wavelength was modeled using GSOLVER software. Such software utilizes full 3-dimensional vector code using hybrid Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis and Modal analysis. GSOLVER calculates diffracted fields and diffraction efficiencies from plane wave illumination of arbitrarily complex grating structures. The illumination can be from any incidence and any polarization.",
        "FIG. 14 illustrates a graphical representation 164 of a resonance wavelength of a biosensor measured as a function of incident angle of an illumination beam. The simulation demonstrates that there is a correlation between the angle of incident light, and the measured peak wavelength. This result implies that the collimation of the illuminating beam, and the alignment between the illuminating beam and the reflected beam affects the measured resonant peak linewidth. If the collimation of the illuminating beam is poor, a range of illuminating angles will be incident on the biosensor surface, and a wider resonant peak will be measured than if purely collimated light were incident.",
        "Because the lower sensitivity limit of a biosensor is related to the ability to determine a peak maxima, it is important to measure a narrow resonant peak. Therefore, the use of a collimating illumination system provides increased sensitivity.",
        "It may be desirable for the illuminating and collecting fiber probes to spatially share the same optical path. Several methods may be used to co-locate illuminating and collecting optical paths. For example, one method includes a single illuminating fiber, which may be coupled at its first end to a light source that directs light at the biosensor, and a single collecting fiber, which may be coupled at its first end to a detector that detects light reflected from the biosensor. Each can be coupled at their second ends to a third fiber probe such that this third fiber acts as both an illuminator and a collector. The third fiber probe is oriented at a normal angle of incidence to the biosensor and supports counter-propagating illuminating and reflecting optical signals.",
        "FIG. 15 illustrates an alternative embodiment of a detection system 170. In this alternative embodiment, the detection system 170 includes a beam splitter 174. The beam splitter 174 enables a single illuminating fiber 178, which is optically coupled to a light source, to be oriented at a 90 degree angle to a collecting fiber 176. The collecting fiber 176 is optically coupled to a detector. Light is directed through the illuminating fiber probe into the beam splitter, which directs light toward the biosensor 172. The reflected light is directed back into the beam splitter 174, which then directs reflected light into the collecting fiber probe 176.",

One advantage of the imaging spectrometer system is that such imaging systems reduce the amount of time for generating a PWV image. Another advantage is to study biological binding of an area in a non-uniform fashion.",
        "The instrument system 319 illustrated in FIG. 20 includes a collimated white light source 320, a beam splitter 324, and an imaging spectrometer 330. Beam splitter 324 redirects the collimated light 322 towards a biosensor in accordance with principles discussed previously. In one embodiment, the biosensor 319 is a conventional microarray chip 328. More preferably, the microarray chip could comprise a plurality of wells or spots arranged in an array of uniform rows and columns.",
        "Imaging spectrometer 332 is used to generate a PWV image for each of the receptor locations (spots) contained in a microarray chip 328. In this embodiment, the microarray chip 328 comprises a plurality of spots arranged in eight (8) rows, where each row contains six (6) spots. For example, a first microarray chip row 331 contains six spots 331(a-f). Similarly, a second microarray chip row 333 contains six spots 333(a-f). All the spots of each row can be simultaneously illuminated incident light 332. As those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, the total number of spots on a microarray chip can be much larger, routinely in the tens of thousands.",
        "Light 322 is collimated and directed towards the beam splitter 324. The beam splitter 324 allows the collimated light 322 and the reflected light 334 to share a common optical path between the beam splitter and the microarray chip 328.",
        "Preferably, the collimated light is directed at the sensor bottom surface 342 at normal incidence via the beam splitter 324. Normally reflected light 334 is collected into an input 335 of the imaging spectrometer 332.",
        "At the microarray chip 328, redirected light 330 illuminates an imaging area 332 along a bottom surface 342 of the microarray chip 328. The redirected light 330 is used to illuminate this imaging area 332. In this embodiment, the illuminated imaging area 332 may be defined by a plurality of spots 331 along the microarray chip 328. Preferably, the illuminated imaging area 332 is defined by either a complete row or a complete column of spots contained on the microarray chip 328. For example, illuminated imaging area 332 could be defined to include the first microarray chip row 331 or row 333.",
        "The bottom surface 342 of the microarray chip 328 is scanned in a sequential manner. to accomplish a complete scan of the bottom surface 342, the microarray chip 328 is transported along a scan direction \u201cA.\u201d As the microarray chip 328 is transported along this scan direction, the collimated light 330 traverses along the complete length of the bottom surface 342 of the microarray chip. In this manner, the instrument system 319 sequentially illuminates and reads out all of the spots in a microarray chip 328. For example, as the chip 328 is moved in the \u201cA\u201d scan direction, chip row 333 is first illuminated and read out, and then chip row 331 is illuminated and then read out. The process continues until all rows are read.",
        "Preferably, the illuminated imaging area includes all the spots along a microarray row. For example, at a given point in time, the redirected light may illuminate a first row of spots on the 8\u00d76 microarray chip. Consequently, light 330 illuminates all six spots 331(a-f) contained in the first row 331 of the microarray chip 328. As the microarray chip 328 is transported along scan direction A, the collimated white light source 320 simultaneously illuminates all of the spots contained in the next microarray row. To complete the read out of the entire microarray chip, each of the eight (8) rows of the microarray chip are sequentially illuminated.",
        "The spectrometer unit 332 preferably comprises an imaging spectrometer containing a two-dimensional Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera and a diffraction grating. The reflected light 334 containing the biosensor resonance signal for each spot is diffracted by the grating in the spectrometer unit. The diffraction produces a spatially segregated wavelength spectra for each point within the illuminated area. (See, e.g., FIG. 18(c). The wavelength spectrum has a second spatial component corresponding to the direction transverse to the scan direction \u201cA.\u201d This second spatial component is subdivided into discrete portions corresponding to spots in this transverse direction.",
        "For example, if the imaging spectrometer includes a CCD camera that contains 512\u00d72048 imaging elements, then an illuminating line is spatially segregated into 512 imaging elements or points. A wavelength spectra is measured for each of the 512 imaging elements or points along the orthogonal axis of the CCD camera. Where the CCD camera contains 512\u00d72048 imaging elements, the CCD would have a resolution of 2048 wavelength data points. Using this method, the PWV's of 512 points are determined for a single \u201cline\u201d or imaging area across the sensor bottom surface 342. For a conventional CCD imaging camera typically having spatial resolution of approximately 10 microns, a 1:1 imaging system is capable of resolving PWV values on sensor surface 342 with a 10 micron resolution. In order to measure a PWV image of the entire sensor bottom surface 342, the sensor 328 is transported along an imaging plane (scan direction A), and subsequent line scans are used to construct a PWV image.",

Processing, mixing, heating, and/or readout of the biosensors may then begin, preferably under the control of the controller assembly 588 (see FIG. 22).",
        "Once the tray 458 retracts into the incubator assembly 460, the tray remains stationary during illumination and read out. For a readout of the microtiter plate 456 to occur, the collimator assembly 708 generates an illumination pattern that is incident along the bottom surface 459 of the plate 456. Preferably, the measuring apparatus 400 generates a beam of light that is incident along an entire row of wells of the plate 456.",
        "Alternatively, the measuring apparatus 400 generates a plurality of illumination beams that are simultaneously incident on a plurality of plate wells. The illumination pattern, comprising multiple beams, is generated by dual illumination fiber optic probes contained within the collimator assembly 708. The construction of the probes is as shown in FIG. 17. As previously herein described, the light reflected off of the biosensor surface may then be detected by the same plurality of probes contained within a collimator assembly 708.

The intensity scale conversion factor is illustrated to be a 0.04 nm per display intensity unit, resulting in a detected wavelength shift of 0.8 nm.",
        "The proposed detection systems are based on collimated white light illumination of a biosensor surface and optical spectroscopy measurement of the resonance peak of the reflected beam. Molecular binding on the surface of a biosensor is indicated by a shift in the peak wavelength value, while an increase in the wavelength corresponds to an increase in molecular absorption.",
        "As shown in theoretical modeling and experimental data, the resonance peak wavelength is strongly dependent on the incident angle of the detection light beam. Because of the angular dependence of the resonance peak wavelength, the incident white light needs to be collimated. Angular dispersion of the light beam broadens the resonance peak, and could reduce biosensor detection sensitivity. In addition, the signal quality from the spectroscopic measurement could depend on the power of the light source and the sensitivity of the detector. In order to obtain a desirable signal-to-noise ratio, a lengthy integration time for each detection location may be required, and therefore lengthen overall time to readout a biosensor plate. A tunable laser source can be used for detection of grating resonance, but is generally cost prohibitive.",
        "In one embodiment, these disadvantages are addressed by using a laser beam for illumination of a biosensor, and a light detector for measurement of reflected beam power. A scanning mirror device can be used for varying the incident angle of the laser beam, and an optical system is used for maintaining collimation of the incident laser beam. See, e.g., \u201cOptical Scanning\u201d (Gerald F. Marchall ed., Marcel Dekker (1991). Any type of laser scanning can be used. For example, a scanning device that can generate scan lines at a rate of about 2 lines to about 1,000 lines per second is useful in the invention. In one embodiment of the invention, a scanning device scans from about 50 lines to about 300 lines per second.",
        "In one embodiment, the reflected light beam passes through part of the laser scanning optical system, and is measured by a single light detector. The laser source can be a diode laser with a wavelength of, for example, 780 nm, 785 nm, 810 nm, or 830 nm. Laser diodes such as these are readily available at power levels up to 150 mW, and their wavelengths correspond to high sensitivity of Si photodiodes. The detector thus can be based on photodiode biosensors.",
        "In another detection system embodiment, while a scanning mirror changes its angular position, the incident angle of the laser beam on the surface changes by nominally twice the mirror angular displacement. The scanning mirror device can be a linear galvanometer, operating at a frequency of about 2 Hz up to about 120 Hz, and mechanical scan angle of about 10 degrees to about 20 degrees. In this example, a single scan can be completed within about 10 msec. A resonant galvanometer or a polygon scanner can also be used.",
        "The angular resolution depends on the galvanometer specification, and reflected light sampling frequency. Assuming galvanometer resolution of 30 arcsec mechanical, corresponding resolution for biosensor angular scan is 60 arcsec, i.e. 0.017 degree. In addition, assume a sampling rate of 100 ksamples/sec, and 20 degrees scan within 10 msec. As a result, the quantiziation step is 20 degrees for 1000 samples, i.e. 0.02 degree per sample. In this example, a resonance peak width of 0.2 degree, as shown by Peng and Morris (Experimental demonstration of resonant anomalies in diffraction from two-dimensional gratings, Optics Lett., 21:549 (1996), will be covered by 10 data points, each of which corresponds to resolution of the detection system.",
        "The advantages of such a detection system includes: increased collimation of incident light by a laser beam, high signal-to-noise ratio due to high beam power of a laser diode, low cost due to a single element light detector instead of a spectrometer, and high resolution of resonance peak due to angular scanning.",
        "The sensitivity of a biosensor is determined by the shift in the location of the resonant peak when material is bound to the biosensor surface. Because of noise inherent in the spectrum, it is preferable to use a procedure for determining an analytical curve\u2014the turning point (i.e., peak) of which is well defined. Furthermore, the peak corresponding to an analytic expression can be preferably determined to greater than sub-sampling-interval accuracy, providing even greater sensitivity.",
        "One embodiment utilizes a method for determining a location of a resonant peak for a binding partner in a resonant reflectance spectrum with a colorimetric resonant biosensor. The method comprises selecting a set of resonant reflectance data for a plurality of colormetric resonant biosensors or a plurality of biosensor distinct locations. The set of resonant reflectance data is collected by illuminating a colormetric resonant diffractive grating surface with a light source and measuring reflected light at a pre-determined incidence. The colormetric resonant diffractive grating surface is used as a surface binding platform for one or more specific binding substances such that binding partners can be detected without use of a molecular label.",
        "The step of selecting a set of resonant reflectance data can include selecting a set of resonant reflectance data:\n\n    \n    \n        a. xi and yi for i=1, 2, 3, . . . n,\n        b. wherein xi is a first measurement includes a first reflectance spectra of one or more specific binding substances attached to the colormetric resonant diffractive grating surface, yi is a second measurement and includes a second reflectance spectra of the one or more specific binding substances after a plurality of binding partners are applied to colormetric resonant diffractive grating surface including the one or more specific binding substances, and n is a total number of measurements collected.",

A difference in a peak wavelength between the first and second measurement is a measurement of an amount of binding partners that bound to the one or more specific binding substances. A sensitivity of a colormetric resonant biosensor can be determined by a shift in a location of a resonant peak in the plurality of sets of two measurements in the set of resonant reflectance data.",
        "A maximum value for a second measurement from the plurality of sets of two measurements is determined from the set of resonant reflectance data for the plurality of binding partners, wherein the maximum value includes inherent noise included in the resonant reflectance data. A maximum value for a second measurement can include determining a maximum value yk such that:\n\n    \n    \n        c. (yk>=yi) for all i, \u2260k.",
        "The algorithm determines whether the maximum value is greater than a pre-determined threshold. This can be calculated by, for example, computing a mean of the set of resonant reflectance data; computing a standard deviation of the set of resonant reflectance data; and determining whether ((yk\u2212mean)/standard deviation) is greater than a pre-determined threshold. The pre-determined threshold is determined by the user. The user will determine what amount of sensitivity is desired and will set the pre-determined threshold accordingly.",
        "If the maximum value is greater than a pre-determined threshold a curve-fit region around the determined maximum value is defined.

The conclusion to be derived is that the peak location is reasonably robust with respect to the particular window chosen: for a shift of approximately 1.5 nm, the corresponding peak location changed by only <0.06 nm, or 4 parts in one hundred sensitivity.",
        "To examine the sensitivity of the peak location with respect to noise in the data, a signal free of noise must be defined, and then incremental amounts of noise is added to the signal and the impact of this noise on the peak location is examined.
