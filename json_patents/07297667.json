        "General Method of Making Compositions",
        "Using the types and amounts of ingredients listed in the examples, the products are prepared at ambient temperature (approximately 20-25 degrees C) by adding the DMDM Hydantoin to the water in a vessel equipped with center turbine agitation. The acrylate copolymer is then added to the water phase and mixed. The sodium laureth sulfate is added to the mixture and then neutralized with sodium hydroxide to a pH range of 6.5-7.5 at 25\u00b0 C. Cocamidopropyl betaine is then added and mixed. The other ingredients are added in order and mixed until uniform. The citric acid is added to adjust the pH to approximately 6.4-7.2. The sodium chloride is added to adjust the viscosity to approximately 4300 centipoise (cps), wherein the formulation viscosity is in the range of 2500-5500 cps as measured by a Brookfield DV II+ Viscometer using Spindle # 5 at 20 RPM at 25\u00b0 C.",

This dispersion was then carefully poured into a 600 ml. graduated cylinder containing a plastic water-filled tube. The cylinder was then mounted onto the center of a Vertical Rotator Assembly and rotated at a constant speed of 30 rpm. The action of the circular mixing of the cylinder and the free falling action of the water-filled tube in the cylinder generated foam which could be measured as foam height using the gradations on the side of the cylinder. After 8 complete revolutions, the Flash Foam Height was measured and after an additional 12 complete revolutions (a total of 20 revolutions) the Maximum Foam Height was measured. At this time the Drainage Time was also measured. Drainage Time is defined as the time measured from the completion of the 20 revolutions to the time at which 100 mls. of apparent liquid has drained.
