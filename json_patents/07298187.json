        "This application claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 200610024670.2, filed Mar. 10, 2006, titled \u201cSystem and Method for Power On Reset and Under Voltage Lockout Schemes,\u201d by inventors Zhen Zhu, Jun Ye, Zhiliang Chen, and Lieyi Fang, commonly assigned, incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.",
        "The present invention relates in general to integrated circuits. More specifically, the invention provides a system and method for power-on reset (POR) and under-voltage lockout (UVLO) schemes. Merely by way of example, the invention is described as it applies to electronic power systems, but it should be recognized that the invention has a broader range of applicability.",
        "Power-on reset (POR) and under-voltage lockout (UVLO) circuits have a wide range of applications. For example, in an electronic system during power on and off transitions, the power supply voltage, typically in order of several to tens of volts, often falls into an invalid state. During an initialization or power-up stage, which usually takes place when the supply voltage for the electronic system is switched on, the supply voltage rises from zero to an operational supply voltage. The operational supply voltage is often within a range associated with a source impedance or source current. During the process when the supply voltage rises from zero to an operational supply voltage, the supply voltage is less than a certain minimum voltage at which the electronic system is designed to properly function. Therefore it is often desirable to prevent any functioning of the electronic system when the supplied voltage is less than the minimum voltage. Generally, the electronic system should be in a reset mode when the supplied voltage is less than a threshold voltage, which is often the minimum voltage. When the electronic system is in the reset mode, components of the electronic system generally stay in their well-defined initial states, ready to properly function after the electronic system starts.",
        "To ensure that an electronic system properly initializes, a voltage detection circuit is often used to generate an output signal to indicate whether the supply voltage has reached a threshold or minimum voltage level. The output signal of the voltage detection circuit is accordingly used to enable or disable the functioning of circuit components.",
        "Often POR and UVLO (POR/UVLO) circuits are used as a voltage detection circuit. In application, a POR/UVLO circuit in an electronic system monitors power supply voltage. When the power supply voltage reaches a predetermined voltage level, which could be a minimum supply voltage or a first threshold voltage, the POR/UVLO circuit generates a POR signal. The POR signal is an indicator to other components of the electronic system that the electronic system has been turned on. In certain instances, the POR/UVLO circuit generates a power-on reset indication when the system power ramps up to the first threshold level that allows the electronic system to operate. In response to the power-on reset indication, other components of the electronic system perform various useful functions. For example, the system components can reset latches and perform start-up operations. When the power supply voltage drops under a second threshold voltage, which may be substantially equally to the first threshold voltage or may be different, the POR/UVLO circuit indicates to the electronic system by generating a UVLO signal. In response to the UVLO signal, the electronic system may shuts down some or all of its components in order to protect the system.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates an example of conventional system for power switching with POR/UVLO functions. The power switching system 100 includes, inter alia, a power supply 101 and a pulse width modulation (PWM) controller circuit 120. The power supply 101 includes an alternative current (AC) source 102, a rectifier 105, and a start up resistor 110. The PWM controller circuit 120 includes, inter alia, a PWM generator 122 and a POR/UVLO circuit 124. During operation, the power supply 101 supplies voltages to the PWM controller circuit 120, and the AC source 102 feeds an alternating current, which is rectified by the rectifier 105 and runs through the start up resistor 110. The PWM controller circuit 120 often uses the start up resistor 110 to start the PWM generator 122. The POR/UVLO circuit 124 provides indication signals to the PWM generator 122 to ensure that power switching system 100 is operating properly.",
        "A POR/UVLO system is a useful application. However, conventional POR/UVLO systems, such as the conventional system illustrated on FIG. 1, generally consume a great amount of power due to high impedance. More specifically, the start up resistor 110 can be a source of significant energy inefficiency. This is because the voltage drop caused by the start up resistor 110, which is the difference between the output voltage 106 and the low voltage supply (VDD) 112, is large. As an example, the output voltage 106 is 370 volts DC, while the VDD 112 is only at 12 volts DC. Under light load or low load conditions, the power loss caused by the large voltage drop is great. To improve energy efficiency, a large start up resistor 110, whose resistance may be in order of mega ohms, is often used. However, the larger resistance not only improves energy efficiency, but also, as being a drawback, significantly lowers the source current, which can be as low as several tens of micro amps, being supplied to the PWM generator 122.",
        "Hence it is highly desirable to improve techniques for power-on reset and under-voltage lockout schemes.",

The other end of the start up resistor 216 is connected to a node 218. The capacitor 214 is grounded at one end and connected to the node 218 at the other end. The output of the power source 210 is connected to the node 218. The POR/UVLO system 220 receives power at the node 218. The first resistor 222 is connected to the power source 210 at the node 218 and the second resistor 226 at the node 224. Also connected to the node 218 is the source of the first PMOS 252. The drain of the first PMOS 252 is connected to the node 224. For example, when there is a proper amount of voltage at the gate of the first PMOS 252, there is little resistance between the source and the drain of the first PMOS 252 and the resistor 222 is essentially shorted.

        "As an example, when power source 210 starts up, the voltage source 212 charges the capacitor 214 through the start up resistor 216. During the start up, the voltage at node 218 ramps up from zero voltage.

        "Once the voltage at node 218 reaches a predetermined threshold voltage Vstart, the second PMOS 254 is turned on and begins conducing current. According an embodiment of the present invention, the threshold voltage Vstart may be determined by the following equation.",

        "According to Equation 1, Vdz1 and Vzd2 are the first Zener voltage and the second Zener voltage, R2 is the resistance of the second resistor 226, R3 is the resistance of the fourth resistor 229, and VT_M0 is the threshold voltage of the second PMOS 254. Once the threshold voltage Vstart is reached, the second PMOS 254 is turned on and starts conducting current. As a result, a voltage Vr0 starts rising up between the node 244 and the ground 246. Once the voltage Vr0 reaches the threshold voltage of the NMOS 240, the NMOS 240 is turned on and begins conducting current. The current being conducted by the first NMOS 240 increases as the gate voltage (at the node 242) of the NMOS 240. As a result of the increased current flow across the NMOS 240, the Vgs (voltage between gate and source, or voltage difference between the node 218 and the node 228) of the second PMOS 254 builds up due to current flowing through the second resistor 226. As the Vgs of the second PMOS 254 increases, more electrical current flows through the third resistor 242, thus increasing the voltage at the node 244.",
        "In short, the first positive feedback loop is formed according to the present embodiment of the invention: a higher voltage from the voltage source 210 causes the second PMOS 254 to conduct current, the current conducted by the second PMOS 254 causes the NMOS 240 to conduct current, the current conducted by the NMOS 240 causes the second PMOS 254 to conduct more current, and the positive feedback process continues. When the NMOS 240 is fully turned on, the second Zener diode 234 is shorted by the first NMOS 240. As a result of the second Zener diode 234 being shorted, the gate voltage Vgs of the second PMOS 254 is large enough to ensure that the voltage at the node 244 is substantially equal to the voltage at the node 218. Because of the voltage at the node 244, the output of the first inverter 245 is logic low and the output of the second inverter 250 is logic high. The output of the second inverter 250 is provided at the node 256 to the first PMOS 252.",
        "As discussed above, a second loop includes the first PMOS 252, the second PMOS 254, the NMOS 240, the first inverter 246, the second inverter 250, the second Zener diode 230, the first resistor 222, the second resistor 226, the third resistor 242, and the fourth resistor 229 according to an embodiment of the present invention. The voltage at the node 256, provided by the second inverter 250, turns the first PMOS 252 on or off. When the output of the second inverter 250 is logic high, the first PMOS 252 is turned off. For example, the first PMOS 252 is not conducting current. The first PMOS 252 being turned off ensures that the second PMOS 254 stays on and continues conducting current, and the output of the second inverter 250 stays at logic high. In short, the second feedback loop is formed according to the present embodiment of the invention: the high logic output from the second inverter 250 ensures that the first PMOS 252 is turned off, the first PMOS 252 being turned off allows the second PMOS 254 to continue conducting current, the current conducted by the second PMOS 254 ensures that the voltage at the node 244 stays high and thus the output from the second inverter 250 stays high, and the positive feedback process continuous.",
        "As an example, the POR/UVLO system 220 is used in conjunction with other electronic components, such as a PWM generator and a gate driver. In one embodiment, the output provided by the second inverter 250 at logic high may be used to turn on these components and ensure these components remain functional.",
        "Under certain conditions according to an embodiment of the present invention, components such as the PWM generator may consume more current than that provided by the power source 210. For example, where a PWM generator receives power from the power source 210 at the node 218, the PWM generator may, at times, consume more power than the power that the power source 210 is capable to supply. Consequentially, the voltage at the node 218 starts falling from the high voltage at which the PWM generator operates. Once the voltage at the node 218 falls below a predetermined voltage Vuvlo, the first PMOS 254 begins turning off. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the voltage Vuvlo is expressed by the following equation.",

        "According to Equation 2, Vdz2 is the second Zener voltage, R1 is the resistance of the first resistor 222, R2 is the resistance of the second resistor 226, R3 is the resistance of the fourth resistor 229, and VT_M0 is the threshold voltage of the second PMOS 254. When the second PMOS 254 decreases conducting current, the current that flows through the third resistor 242 decreases, causing the voltage at the node 244 to drop. Due to the voltage drop at the node 244, which is connected to the gate of the NMOS 240, the NMOS 240 decreases the current being conducted. As a part of the first positive feedback loop, the decreased current being conducted by the NMOS 240 decreases the voltage Vgs of the first PMOS 254. As the first positive feedback loops continues in operation, the first PMOS 254 eventually turns off, and the voltage at node 244 decreases to zero. As a result, the output of the first inverter 246 is at logic high and the output of the second inverter 250 is at logic low. In one embodiment, the output provided by the second inverter 250 at logic low may be used to turn off other electronic components, such as a PWM generator and a gate driver.",

This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. FIG. 3a shows a first voltage profile 310 for the gate of the first NMOS 240 and a second voltage profile 320 for the output of the second inverter 250. As can be seen, the voltage according to the second voltage profile usually only drops from high to low after the voltage according to the first voltage profile has dropped from high to low first. As an example applied to an embodiment of the present invention, the output of the second inverter 250 is turned to logic low after the second PMOS 240 has already been turned off. However, it is often not possible to always turn off PMOS 240 before obtaining a logic low at the output of the second inverter 250.",
        "FIG. 3b is a timing diagram illustrating the voltages levels at an NMOS and a second inverter according to another embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. FIG. 3b shows a first voltage profile 330 for the gate of the first NMOS 240 and a second voltage profile 340 for the output of the second inverter 250. In contrast to FIG. 3a, the output voltage of the second inverter drops to low before the voltage level at the first NMOS reaches low. As can be seen on FIG. 3b, the voltage profile 340 for the output of the second inverter 250 drops from high to low first. As a result, the voltage profile 340 is not in synchronization with the voltage profile 330 for the first NMOS 240, and the first NMOS 240 may fall into an invalid state 350 if the second feedback loop is not included in the POR/UVLO system 220. For example, when the output of the second inverter 250 produces a logic low, this output is used to turn off a PWM generator. However, because the first NMOS 240 is not turned off, the voltage source 210 continues to deliver current. The capacitor 214 and the start up resistor 216 recharges voltage at the node 218. Due to the voltage at the node 218, the second PMOS 254 may be turned on. With PMOS 254 turned on, the voltage at node 218 may falls between Vstart and Vuvlo, i.e., lower than the start up voltage but higher than the UVLO voltage. The output of the second inverter 250 stays at logic low, and the first NMOS 240 goes into an indefinite state, i.e., neither fully on or fully off. Therefore, the first feedback loop by itself does not provide a reliable UVLO function. According to an embodiment, the second feedback loops is used to help prevent indefinite state and ensure proper function of the PWM generator. As a result, the PWM generator is turned off and cannot be restarted. It is to be appreciated that the present invention presents a novel system for providing a reliable UVLO function. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the second positive feedback loop is used to ensure the reliability of the UVLO function.",

This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. A second positive feedback loop is used to ensure the reliability of the UVLO function as shown in FIG. 2. FIG. 3c shows a first voltage profile 360 for the NMOS 240, a second voltage profile 370 for the output of the second inverter 250, and a third voltage profile 380 for the first PMOS 252. As an example, if the output of the second inverter 250 drops from high to low before the first NMOS 240 drops from high to low, the PWM generator is turned off by the logic low at the output of the second inverter 250. When the PWM generator is turned off and consumes no current, the capacitor 214 and the start up resistor 216 recharges voltage at the node 218, causing the voltage at the node 218 to ramp up again. At the same time, the output of the second inverter 250 at logic low turns on the first PMOS 252 and decreases the voltage Vgs of the second PMOS 254. Due to the decreased voltage at Vgs, the second PMOS delivers less current to the third resistor 242, and the voltage at the node 244 decreases. The decrease of voltage at node 244 decreases the Vgs of the NMOS 240. As the second feedback loop continues in operation, the NMOS 240 and the second PMOS 254 become fully turned off, the first PMOS 252 is turned on, and the output of the second inverter 250 stays at logic low. The POR/UVLO system 220 is itself shut off and turns off other components such as the PWM generator, along with other components.",

        "According to Equation 4b, Vdz2 is the second Zener voltage, Vd2 is the forward voltage of the second diode 2237, Vd3 is the forward voltage of the third diode 2222, R2 is the resistance of the second resistor 2226, R3 is the resistance of the fourth resistor 2229, and VT_M0 is the threshold voltage of the second PMOS 2254. When the second PMOS 2254 decreases conducting current, the current that flows through the third resistor 2242 decreases, causing the voltage at the node 2244 to drop. Due to the voltage drop at the node 2244, which is connected to the gate of the NMOS 2240, the NMOS 2240 decreases the current being conducted. As a part of the first positive feedback loop, the decreased current being conducted by the NMOS 2240 decreases the voltage Vgs of the first PMOS 2254. As the first positive feedback loops continues in operation, the first PMOS 2254 eventually turns off, and the voltage at node 2244 decreases to zero. As a result, the first inverter 2246 is at logic high and the second inverter 2250 is at logic low.",
