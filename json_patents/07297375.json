        "This application is a National Phase Application of Patent Application PCT/EP01/00973 filed on Jan. 30, 2001.",
        "The present invention relates to a novel polyurethane-based aqueous coating material and to its use for producing single-coat and multicoat color and/or effect paint systems in automotive OEM finishing and automotive refinish, in industrial coating, including coil coating and container coating, in the coating of plastics, and in furniture coating.",
        "Aqueous coating materials curable thermally and comprising a crosslinking agent, a color and/or effect pigment, and an ionically and/or nonionically stabilized polyurethane which is saturated, unsaturated and/or grafted with olefinically unsaturated compounds and is based on aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aliphatic-cycloaliphatic, aromatic, aliphatic-aromatic and/or cycloaliphatic-aromatic polyisocyanates, and the corresponding paint systems, are known, for example, from patent EP-A-0 089 497, DE-A-44 37 535, DE-C-197 22 862 or DE-A-196 45 761. These known aqueous coating materials, especially the aqueous basecoat materials, and the single-coat or multicoat color and/or effect paint systems produced with them possess very good performance properties.",
        "Where the single-coat or multicoat color and effect paint systems produced from the known aqueous basecoat materials comprise effect pigments, especially metallic pigments, there may be formation of what are known as clouds, i.e., areas of light/dark shading. These are an indicator of deficiencies in dispersing and/or orienting the color and/or effect pigments, especially the effect pigments, in the finish. However, it is precisely in the case of particularly high-value products having extensive finishes, such as automobiles, for example, that cloudy finishes are fundamentally unacceptable, since paint defects of this kind suggest low quality in the entire product (e.g., the automobile).",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel aqueous coating material which is curable thermally, or thermally and with actinic radiation, and which is very highly suitable as an aqueous basecoat material or solid-color topcoat material for producing single-coat and multicoat color and effect paint systems which exhibit markedly reduced clouding tendency. Furthermore, the otherwise excellent performance properties of the existing aqueous basecoat materials and solid-color topcoat materials ought not to be impaired, but instead retained in their entirety. Not least, the reduction in clouding ought also to accompany overcoating of the novel aqueous basecoat films with any of a wide variety of clearcoats.",
        "The invention accordingly provides the novel aqueous coating material curable physically, thermally and/or with actinic radiation, which comprises\n\n    A) at least one ionically and/or nonionically stabilized polyurethane which is saturated, unsaturated and/or grafted with olefinically unsaturated compounds, as binder,\n    B) at least one color and/or effect pigment, and\n    C) at least one colorless, transparent or opaque powder which is substantially inert with respect to the other constituents of the coating material and whose particles have an average size of from 1.0 to 10.0 \u03bcm and a density of from 0.8 to 3.6 g cm\u22123 \n\nand is referred to below as the \u201ccoating material of the invention\u201d.",
        "Further subject matter of the invention will emerge from the following description.",
        "In the light of the prior art it was surprising and unforeseeable for the skilled worker that the object on which the present invention is based could be achieved by means of the specially selected powder (C) for use in accordance with the invention. Indeed, the expectation was more that the use of powders (C) whose average particle size lies within the order of magnitude of the dry film thickness of the basecoats or solid-color topcoats produced from the coating materials of the invention would be accompanied by serious disadvantages, especially with regard to the quality of the overall appearance and the level of intercoat adhesion.",
        "The coating material of the invention is physically curing.",
        "In the context of the present invention, the term \u201cphysical curing\u201d denotes the curing of a layer of a coating material by filming through loss of solvent from the coating material, with linking within the coating taking place via looping of the polymer molecules of the binders (regarding the term, cf. R\u00f6mpp Lexikon Lacke und Druckfarben, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, N.Y., 1998, \u201cbinders\u201d, pages 73 and 74). Or else filming takes place by way of the coalescence of binder particles (cf. R\u00f6mpp Lexikon Lacke und Druckfarben, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, N.Y., 1998, \u201ccuring\u201d, pages 274 and 275). Normally, no crosslinking agents are required for this purpose. Where appropriate physical curing may be assisted by atmospheric oxygen, by heat or by exposure to actinic radiation.",
        "The coating material of the invention is thermally curable. In this context it may be self-crosslinking or externally crosslinking.",
        "In the context of the present invention, the term \u201cself-crosslinking\u201d refers to the capacity of a binder to enter into crosslinking reactions with itself. A prerequisite for this is that the binders already contain both kinds of complementary reactive functional groups which are necessary for crosslinking. Externally crosslinking coating materials, adhesives and sealing compounds, on the other hand, are those in which one kind of the complementary reactive functional groups is present in the binder and the other kind is present in a curing or crosslinking agent. For further details, refer to R\u00f6mpp Lexikon Lacke und Druckfarben, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, N.Y., 1998, \u201ccuring\u201d, pages 274 to 276, especially page 275, bottom.",
        "The coating material of the invention is curable thermally and with actinic radiation. Where thermal curing and curing with actinic light are employed together in the context of one coating material, the terms \u201cdual cure\u201d and \u201cdual-cure coating material\u201d are also used.",
        "In the context of the present invention, actinic radiation means electromagnetic radiation, such as visible light, UV radiation or X-rays, especially UV radiation, and corpuscular radiation, such as electron beams.",
        "The coating material of the invention is a one-component (1K) system.",
        "In the context of the present invention, a one-component (1K) system is a coating material curable thermally or thermally and with actinic radiation in which the binder and the crosslinking agent are present alongside one another, i.e., in one component. A prerequisite for this is that the two constituents crosslink with one another only at relatively high temperatures and/or on exposure to actinic radiation.",
        "The coating material of the invention may also be a two-component (2K) or multicomponent (3K, 4K) system.",
        "In the context of the present invention, this means a coating material in which in particular the binder and the crosslinking agent are present separately from one another in at least two components which are not combined until shortly before application. This form is chosen when binder and crosslinking agent react with one another even at room temperature. Coating materials of this kind are employed in particular for coating thermally sensitive substrates, especially in automotive refinish.",
        "The coating material of the invention is aqueous. This means that its constituents are present in dispersion and/or solution in water or in a mixture of water and minor amounts of at least one water-miscible organic solvent. In this context, \u201cminor amounts\u201d are amounts which do not destroy the aqueous nature of the mixture.",
        "The inventively essential constituent of the coating material of the invention is the powder (C). This powder (C) is a powder of uniform composition, i.e., its particles materially have the same composition. Or else it is a mixture of at least two powders (C). The decision as to which variant is given preference is guided by the requirements which are imposed on the coating material of the invention in the case in hand. In the great majority of cases, the use of one powder (C) is sufficient to achieve the advantages according to the invention.",
        "The powder (C) for use in accordance with the invention is colorless. This means that it has no hue and no chroma but only lightness. Accordingly, it is white or has a gray shade. Preferably, however, it is white. For further details, refer to R\u00f6mpp Lexikon Lacke und Druckfarben, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, N.Y., 1998, \u201cachromatic point\u201d, page 590.",
        "The powder (C) is transparent in the sense of clear or opaque in the sense of hiding. Preference is given to using transparent powders (C).",
        "The powder (C) is substantially inert. This means that, within the period of time commonly envisaged for the preparation, storage, and processing of the coating material of the invention, it is soluble only sparingly if at all in water and in the organic solvents possibly still present in the coating material of the invention, does not absorb any major constituents of the coating material or cause them to flocculate, does not enter into any chemical reactions, or enters into only very slowly proceeding chemical reactions, with essential constituents of the coating material, does not catalyze any chemical reactions between the essential constituents of the coating material, and is unaltered, or altered only very slowly, in its properties by heat and/or actinic light.",
        "The powder (C) has an average particle size of from 1.0 to 10.0, preferably from 3.0 to 7.5, and in particular from 4.0 to 7.0 \u03bcm.",
        "Advantageous powders (C) have a comparatively narrow particle size distribution. In other words, the fractions both of fine material and of coarse material are comparatively low. Particularly advantageous powders (C) have a maximum particle size of below 12, preferably below 11 and in particular below 10 \u03bcm.",
        "The particles of the powder (C) for use in accordance with the invention have a density of from 0.8 to 3.6, preferably from 0.9 to 3.4, more preferably from 1.0 to 3.2, and in particular from 1.1 to 3.0 g cm3.",
        "In certain cases it would also be possible to use particles having a lower density; in that case, however, the risk exists of the particles floating in the coating materials on prolonged storage. Alternatively, it would also be possible in certain cases to use particles having a higher density; in that case, however, the risk exists of the particles settling fairly rapidly on prolonged storage.",
        "The particles of the powders (C) for use in accordance with the invention may be of any desired shape. In accordance with the invention it is of advantage if they have a spherical shape. In the context of the present invention, a spherical shape is a shape substantially like that of a ball. Examples of spherical shapes are beads, egg-shaped particles, dodecahedra or icosahedra, which may also have certain irregularities.",
        "Examples of suitable substances of which the particles or powders (C) may consist are crosslinked or uncross-linked, organic or organometallic polymers, inorganic minerals, salts or ceramic materials, or organically modified ceramic materials, or mixtures of these substances. Of these, the inorganic minerals are of advantage and are therefore used with preference. These minerals may be natural minerals or synthetic minerals.",
        "Examples of the highly suitable minerals are silicon dioxide, aluminum silicates, calcium silicates, magnesium silicates, calcium aluminum silicates, magnesium aluminum silicates, calcium magnesium silicates, calcium magnesium aluminum silicates, beryllium aluminum silicates, aluminum phosphate or calcium phosphate, or mixtures thereof. Of these, silicon dioxide is particularly advantageous and is therefore used with particular preference in accordance with the invention.",
        "The preparation of the powders (C) for use in accordance with the invention has no special features in terms of its method but instead takes place with the aid of methods such as are customary and known in the field of organic, organometallic or inorganic chemistry. For example, organic polymers may be produced by emulsion, dispersion or precipitation polymerization or by size reduction, for example by grinding or spraying, of melts or solutions of ready-produced polymers. The inorganic particles may be produced, for example, by precipitation processes and/or size reduction. In the case of ceramic materials, it is normal first to produce a green body, which may already have the desired powder form, and then to fire it.",
        "Where appropriate, the surfaces of the particles are subjected to an aftertreatment, for example, to a hydrophilicizing or hydrophobicizing treatment. However, the aftertreatment must not remove the inertness of the particles.",
        "The powders (C) may be incorporated as they are into the coating materials of the invention, provided they are readily dispersed and do not agglomerate. In accordance with the invention it is of advantage if the powders (C) are incorporated in the form of powder pastes. Further advantages result if the paste resins or grinding resins used comprise binders which are present in the coating material of the invention.",
        "The amount of the powders (C) in the coating materials of the invention may vary very widely and is guided primarily by the intensity of the light/dark shading that is to be avoided and by the specified shade of the color and effect coating which is produced from the respective coating material of the invention. It is preferred to employ from 0.09 to 5.0%, more preferably from 0.12 to 3.5%, and in particular from 0.3 to 2.5% by weight, based in each case on the solids content of the coating material of the invention.",
        "The further essential constituent of the coating material of the invention is at least one binder (A).",
        "In accordance with the invention, said binder (A) comprises at least one ionically and/or nonionically stabilized polyurethane (A) which is saturated, unsaturated and/or grafted with olefinically unsaturated compounds.",
        "Advantageously, depending on the nature of the stabilization, the polyurethane (A) for inventive use has an acid number or amine number of from 10 to 250 mg KOH/g (ionic stabilization or nonionic plus ionic stabilization) or of from 0 to 10 mg KOH/g (nonionic stabilization), an OH number of from 30 to 350 mg KOH/g, and a number average molecular weight of from 1500 to 100,000 daltons.",
        "The method of preparing the polyurethane (A) is arbitrary. It is preferably obtainable by preparing, in a first process step, a polyurethane prepolymer which contains at least one free isocyanate group.",
        "The polyurethane prepolymer is of linear, branched or comb, but especially linear, construction. In this context the linear polyurethane prepolymer includes preferably two free isocyanate groups, especially two terminal free isocyanate groups. The branched or comb-constructed polyurethane prepolymers include preferably at least two, in particular more than two, free isocyanate groups, terminal free isocyanate groups being preferred.",
        "In terms of method, the preparation of the polyurethane prepolymers for use in accordance with the invention has no special features but instead takes place, for example, as described in patent DE-C-197 22 862, DE-A196 45 761, DE-A-44 37 535, EP-A-0 522 419 or EP-A0 522 420, by reaction of at least one polyol, especially a diol, with at least one polyisocyanate, especially a diisocyanate, the isocyanate component being employed in a molar excess so as to give terminal free isocyanate groups.",
        "For the preparation of the polyurethane prepolymers it is preferred to use diisocyanates and also, if desired, in minor amounts, polyisocyanates, for the purpose of introducing branches. In the context of the present invention, minor amounts are amounts which do not cause gelling of the polyurethane prepolymers during their preparation. This may also be prevented by using small amounts of monoisocyanates.",

        "Further examples of suitable coatings additives (D) are described in the textbook \u201cLackadditive\u201d [Additives for coatings] by Johan Bieleman, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, N.Y., 1998.",
        "Viewed in terms of its method, the preparation of the coating material of the invention has no special features but instead takes place by the dispersing of its constituents in water, in which context it is possible to employ primary or secondary dispersion methods and also customary and known mixing equipment such as stirred tanks, dissolvers, stirred mills, or extruders. For example, refer to the prior art cited at the outset.",
        "The coating material of the invention, especially the aqueous basecoat material of the invention, is outstandingly suitable for producing multicoat color and/or effect paint systems on primed and unprimed substrates by the wet-on-wet technique. Additionally, the coating material, especially solid-color topcoat material, of the invention is outstandingly suitable for producing single-coat color and/or effect paint systems.",
        "The coating material of the invention may also be used, furthermore, as an adhesive or sealing compound or as a starting product for producing self-supporting paint films.",
        "The coating material of the invention exhibits particular advantages in its use as an aqueous basecoat material as part of the wet-on-wet technique, wherein the aqueous basecoat material is applied to the primed or unprimed substrate and dried, but not cured, a clearcoat material is subsequently applied to the aqueous basecoat film, and the resulting clearcoat film is cured together with the aqueous basecoat film, thermally or both thermally and with actinic radiation (dual cure).",
        "Suitable substrates are all surfaces for coating which are not damaged by curing of the films present thereon using heat, or heat and actinic radiation in combination (dual cure); for example, metals, plastics, wood, ceramic, stone, textile, fiber assemblies, leather, glass, glass fibers, glass wool and rock wool, mineral-bound and resin-bound building materials, such as plasterboard and cement slabs or roof tiles, and composites of these materials. Accordingly, the multicoat paint systems of the invention are suitable for applications outside those of automotive OEM finishing and automotive refinish, as well. In this context they are particularly suitable for the coating of furniture and for industrial application, including coil coating and container coating. In the context of industrial applications they are suitable for coating virtually all parts for private or industrial use, such as radiators, domestic appliances, small metal parts such as nuts and bolts, hubcaps, wheel rims, or packaging.",
        "In the case of electrically conductive substrates it is possible to use primers, which are prepared in a customary and known manner from electrodeposition coating materials. Both anodic and cathodic electrodeposition coating materials are suitable for this purpose, but especially cathodics. Normally, especially in the painting of automobiles, a surfacer coat or antistonechip primer coat, which may be regarded as part of the primer, is applied over the electrocoat.",
        "It is also possible to coat, bond or seal parts made of primed or unprimed plastics, for example, ABS, AMMA, ASA, CA, CAB, EP, UF, CF, MF, MPF, PF, PAN, PA, PE, HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE, UHMWPE, PC, PC/PBT, PC/PA, PET, PMMA, PP, PS, SB, PUR, PVC, RF, SAN, PBT, PPE, POM, PUR-RIM, SMC, BMC, PP-EPDM and UP (abbreviations to DIN 7728T1). In the case of unfunctionalized and/or apolar substrate surfaces, these may be subjected prior to coating in a known manner to a pretreatment, such as with a plasma or by flaming, or may be provided with a water-based primer.",
        "The aqueous basecoat materials of the invention may be applied by any standard method, such as spraying, knifecoating, brushing, flowcoating, dipping, impregnating, trickling or rolling, for example. The substrate to be coated may itself be at rest, with the application device or unit being moved. Alternatively, the substrate to be coated, especially a coil, may be moved, with the application unit being at rest relative to the substrate or being moved appropriately.",
        "It is preferred to employ spray application methods, such as compressed air spraying, airless spraying, high-speed rotation, electrostatic spray application (ESTA), for example, alone or in conjunction with hot spray applications such as hot air spraying, for example. Application can be carried out at temperatures of max. 70 to 80\u00b0 C., so that suitable application viscosities are attained without the short period of thermal loading being accompanied by any changing or damage to the aqueous basecoat material or its over-spray, which may be intended for reprocessing. Hot spraying, for instance, may be configured in such a way that the aqueous basecoat material is heated only very briefly in the spray nozzle or only shortly before the spray nozzle.",
        "It is particularly advantageous to apply the aqueous basecoat material of the invention by ESTA in a first pass and pneumatically in a second pass.",
        "Where the aqueous basecoat materials of the invention include constituents which can be activated with actinic radiation, application is conducted preferably in the absence of light. These application methods may of course also be used for the application of the clearcoat film as part of the wet-on-wet technique of the invention.",
        "Curing may take place after a certain rest period. This period may have a duration of from 30 seconds to 2 hours, preferably from 1 minute to 1 hour, and in particular from 1 to 45 minutes. The rest period serves, for example, for leveling and for the devolatilization of the paint films or for the evaporation of volatile constituents such as solvents.",
        "The rest period may be shortened and/or assisted by the application of elevated temperatures up to 90\u00b0 C. and/or by means of a reduced air humidity <10 g water/kg air, in particular <5 g/kg air, provided this does not cause any damage or alterations to the paint films, such as premature complete crosslinking, for instance.",
        "Physical curing takes place even during the rest period and may be accelerated by the application of heat, with the possibility of using the methods employed below in the context of the thermal cure.",
        "The thermal cure has no special features as far as its method is concerned but instead takes place in accordance with the customary and known methods such as heating in a forced air oven or irradiation using IR lamps. The thermal cure may also be carried out in stages. Advantageously, it takes place at a temperature from 50 to 100\u00b0 C., with particular preference from 60 to 100\u00b0 C., and in particular from 80 to 100\u00b0 C. for a time of from 1 minute to 2 hours, with particular preference from 2 minutes to 1 hour, and in particular from 3 to 45 minutes. Where substrates with high thermal load-bearing capacities are used, thermal crosslinking may also be carried out at temperatures above 100\u00b0 C. In this case it is generally advisable not to exceed temperatures of 180\u00b0 C., preferably 160\u00b0 C., and in particular 155\u00b0 C.",
        "The curing with actinic radiation also has no special features in terms of its method, but instead takes place in a customary and known manner by irradiation with UV lamps and/or electron beam sources, preferably under inert gas.",
        "In the case of conjoint curing of the dual-cure aqueous basecoat films of the invention with the clearcoat films, thermal curing and actinic radiation curing may be employed simultaneously or in alternation. Where the two curing methods are used in alternation, it is possible, for example, to commence with thermal curing and to end with actinic radiation curing. In other cases it may prove advantageous to commence and to end with actinic radiation curing. The skilled worker is able to determine the curing method most advantageous for the case in hand on the basis of his or her general knowledge in the art, with or without the assistance of simple preliminary tests.",
        "In this context it is found to be a further particular advantage of the aqueous basecoat material of the invention that, in the context of the wet-on-wet technique, all customary and known clearcoat materials may be combined with the aqueous basecoat film of the invention.",
