        "The present invention relates to novel alkylhalosilylaminoboranes, in particular alkylchlorosilylaminoboranes, which make it possible to adjust the viscosity of polyborosilazane compounds by varying the number of reactive centers, to novel borosilazane compounds, to novel oligoborosilazane or polyborosilazane compounds which comprise the structural feature R1\u2014Si\u2014NH\u2014B\u2014R2, where R1 or R2 or both is/are a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, in particular alkyl, phenyl or vinyl groups, to silicon carbonitride ceramic powder, to ceramic material based on SiC, Si3N4 and BN, and to processes for the preparation of each and to the use of the polyborosilazanes and the ceramic materials, in particular for the production of fibers.",
        "The production of multinary, nonoxidic ceramics via molecular single component precursors has achieved great importance. It makes it possible to obtain nitridic, carbidic and carbonitridic material systems which are not obtainable via conventional solid state reactions. The products have a high purity, homogeneous element distribution and uniform particle size.",
        "Materials comprising silicon (Si), boron (B) and nitrogen (N) and possibly also carbon (C) and at the same time contain no or very little oxygen display particular properties in respect of the thermal stability and the oxidation resistance. They can be used industrially as bulk materials, in composites, for coatings or as ceramic fibers. The boron-containing materials generally display increased crystallization inhibition, while carbon-containing materials additionally have a higher decomposition temperature than do carbon-free ceramics. Owing to the high mechanical strength, the corrosion resistance at high temperatures, the thermal shock resistance and the high-temperature strength of such materials, they can be used, for example, as reinforcing materials for high-temperature composites and are employed in the automobile industry and in the aircraft industry, for example in turbochargers, turbines of jet engines and also for the lining of rocket nozzles and combustion chambers.",
        "The production of ceramics via inorganic polymers is very promising. Crosslinking of molecular structural units gives polymers which can be converted into ceramics by pyrolysis. This route, which has already been followed by Chantrell and Popper, Special Ceramics (editor: E. P. Popper), Academic Press, New York (1964), 87-103, offers new opportunities, in particular for carbidic and nitridic ceramics of main groups 3 and 4.",
        "Winter, Verbeek and Mansmann (Bayer AG) (1975), U.S. Pat. No. 3,892,583, have developed the first spinnable inorganic polymers which have been prepared by aminolysis or ammonolysis of methylchlorosilanes. These were able to be converted into Si/C/N fibers by pyrolysis. The first fibers of commercial significance go back to Yajima who converted polycarbosilanes into carbon-rich SiC fibers (trade name: NICALON), S. Yajima, J. Hayashi, M. Omori (1978), U.S. Pat. No. 4,100,233.",
        "The first homogeneous ceramic in the system Si/B/N/C of the approximate composition SiBN3C was produced by Wagner, Jansen and Baldus, O. Wagner (1992), EP 502399. The fibers of this material, which is prepared by aminolysis of the single-component precursor trichlorosilylaminodichloroborane (TADB) Cl3Si\u2014(NH)\u2014BCl2, have an excellent property profile, H. P. Baldus, M. Jansen, Dr. Sporn, Science (1999) 285, p. 699. Further improved high-temperature properties are displayed by ceramics from the precursor TSDE (trichlorosilyldichloroborylethane, Cl3Si\u2014[CH\u2014CH3]\u2014BCl2), M. Jansen, H. J\u00fcngermann (Bayer AG) (1997), WO98/45302 A1.",
        "Thus, the high-temperature stability of the ceramics appears to improve with increasing carbon content. This is shown, for example, by the progression of the decomposition temperatures (under inert gas conditions) of the ceramics Si3B3N7, SiBN3C (\u2550Si3B3N7.C2.4) and SiBN2.5C2 (\u2550Si3B3N7.C6) which differ essentially only in their carbon content.

Thus, TADB can be reacted not only with methylamine or ammonia but also with further amines such as guanidine to form polymers.",
        "In the ceramics mentioned, silicon and boron are coordinated exclusively by nitrogen. The realization of new structural features such as Si\u2014C or B\u2014C bonds in ceramics leads to improved mechanical strength and thermal stability of a ceramic.",
        "The rheological properties, e.g. the viscosity of a polymer for an appropriate processing method, can be adjusted by, for example, thermal pretreatment. However, the known polymers in the system Si/B/N/C have the disadvantage that thermal crosslinking increases continuously in the liquid, i.e. molten, state and the rheological properties such as the viscosity thus do not remain constant during processing. This causes considerable problems such as blocking of the nozzles in the drawing of fibers. Linearly crosslinked molecules are advantageous for achieving a very high elongation in the drawing of fibers. The single-component precursors mentioned have too many reactive centers which lead to multidimensional crosslinking. A polymer consisting predominantly of chains would be advantageous.",
        "It is therefore an object of the invention to provide novel organometallic precursor compounds which can be prepared in high yields and a process for converting these precursor compounds into nitridic ceramics which comprise Si, N, B and C and overcome the abovementioned disadvantages. Adjustment of the number of reactive centers, i.e. the halogen atoms, in the monomeric precursors should make it possible to adjust the rheological properties, in particular to adjust the viscosity, in the reaction to form polyborosilazanes. In particular, the constancy of the rheological properties such as the viscosity in liquid form should be improved thereby. Furthermore, this process should make it possible to prepare ceramics having a high proportion of carbon. In the ceramic, the silicon should be partly coordinated by carbon.",
        "This object is achieved according to the invention by amorphous ceramics or nanocomposites, by their precursor compounds, by the respective processes for producing them and by the use of the polyborosilazanes and the ceramic materials, as disclosed in the claims.",

Such compounds make it possible to produce ceramics which, owing to the increased carbon content and the realization of new structural features such as Si\u2014C or B\u2014C bonds, display improved mechanical strength and thermal stability. The replacement of halogen radicals in the alkylhalosilylaminoboranes of the invention by hydrocarbon radicals, both on the Si and on the B, leads not only to the advantageous introduction of carbon but also to a targeted reduction in the number of reactive halogen atoms. The rheological properties, in particular the viscosity, of the oligomers or polymers formed from the compounds of the invention can be varied or/and set by this means. Particularly advantageous compounds are ones which have three hydrocarbon radicals (x+y=3) containing two halogen atoms capable of crosslinking, which limits multidimensional crosslinking.",

It has been found that, in particular, the processing properties of the polyborosilazanes of the invention to produce fibers can be improved further by setting appropriate reaction parameters in the polycondensation. The process of the invention for preparing an oligoborosilazane or polyborosilazane compound therefore preferably encompasses at least one process step in which a polycondensation is carried out at temperatures of \u2266200\u00b0 C. or/and under reduced pressure, preferably from 0.01 kPa to 10 kPa. Under these reaction conditions, largely \u201clinearized\u201d oligomers or prepolymers having rheological properties which are particularly favorable for the melt spinning process are formed. The curability of the green fibers by means of reactive gases is not impaired. In addition, the homogeneity of the polymer in respect of the element distribution is improved further under these preferred reaction conditions.",
        "Polyborosilazanes which are to be processed further to produce fibers can be obtained from chlorinated precursors such as TADB by reacting the precursors in an inert solvent such as hexane with an amine such as methylamine. This gives, apart from insoluble methylammonium chloride which can be filtered off, a soluble borosilazane oligomer mixture. After distilling off the solvent, the still liquid material can then be polycondensed thermally with elimination of methylamine to give a product which is solid at room temperature and is suitable for the melt spinning process. In the case of the borosilazane oligomer mixture prepared from TADB, temperatures of about 250\u00b0 C. are advantageously used for the thermal polycondensation. In the case of borosilazane oligomer mixtures prepared from MADB or DADB, higher temperatures of up to 500\u00b0 C. are often advantageous because of the smaller number of crosslinking sites per monomer unit.",
        "Moreover, compounds having the structural unit \u2261Si\u2014N(R)\u2014B\u2550 are thermally sensitive and can easily decompose to form monosilane and borazine derivatives. Such a decomposition reaction with elimination of monosilazanes and oligosilazanes can also take place during the polycondensation of borosilazane oligomer mixtures at elevated temperatures. This decomposition reaction often results in the occurrence of inhomogeneities in the element distribution. The advantage of a single-component precursor, namely, in particular, a homogeneous element distribution in the ceramic end product, can be lost by separation into a two-component system which can impair the high-temperature properties of the material. For this reason, process temperatures for the polycondensation of an oligomeric mixture of \u2266200\u00b0 C., preferably \u2266180\u00b0 C., more preferably \u2266150\u00b0 C., and at least 50\u00b0 C., more preferably \u2267100\u00b0 C., have been found to be advantageous. If this temperature is, in the case of the starting materials selected, not sufficient to give a product which is solid at room temperature, as is required, in particular, for future use in the melt spinning process, the reaction is advantageously carried out under reduced pressure. The pressure is then preferably \u226690 kPa, more preferably \u226610 kPa, particularly preferably \u22661 kPa and even more preferably \u22660.1 kPa.",
        "Under these preferred process conditions, a polyborosilazane having a very homogeneous element distribution is obtained. Furthermore, it has good processability to produce green fibers and can be cured chemically and ceramicized. A further advantage of carrying out the process under reduced pressure is that any monosilazanes or oligosilazanes formed can be distilled off under reduced pressure and thus do not contaminate the product.",
        "The desired silicon borocarbonitride ceramics can be produced from the polyborosilazanes of the invention. Accordingly, the invention further provides a process for producing a silicon carboboronitride ceramic which is characterized in that a monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric borosilazane compound as described herein is heated in an inert or amine-containing and, if carbon-free ceramics are desired, ammonia-containing atmosphere at temperatures of from 800\u00b0 C. to 2000\u00b0 C., preferably from 1000\u00b0 C. to 1800\u00b0 C. and most preferably from 1350\u00b0 C. to 1750\u00b0 C. Aminolysis or ammonolysis reactions and subsequent pyrolysis convert the borosilazanes into a silicon carboboronitride ceramic powder. C\u2014Si\u2014N\u2014B structural units are preferably present in the ceramic and the elements Si, N, B and C are preferably present in an amount of more than 93% by mass, more preferably more than 97% by mass. The silicon carboboronitride ceramic of the invention has, in particular, a low oxygen content of preferably <7% by mass, more preferably <1% by mass and most preferably <0.5% by mass. The process of the invention for producing a silicon carboboronitride ceramic makes it possible to produce ceramics which are virtually free of oxygen. For the reaction of the borosilazane compounds with ammonia, it is possible to utilize all aminolysis or ammonolysis processes known from the literature for tetrachlorosilane, for example reaction with solid or liquid ammonia at low temperatures (U.S. Pat. No. 4,196,178), reaction with gaseous ammonia in an organic solvent (U.S. Pat. No. 3,959,446) or reaction with ammonia in a high-temperature reaction with elimination of hydrogen chloride (U.S. Pat. No. 4,145,224).",
        "The inert atmosphere can be selected from among a noble gas atmosphere, for example an argon or helium atmosphere, a nitrogen atmosphere and an atmosphere comprising another inert gas which does not react with the reactants under the reaction conditions of from 800\u00b0 C. to 2000\u00b0 C.",
        "The ceramic yields in the pyrolysis are generally in the range from 65% to 80%. The pyrolysis product is a ceramic material which comprises more than 93% by mass, preferably more than 97% by mass, of the elements Si, N, B and C and contains the structural units C\u2014Si\u2014N\u2014B, Si\u2014N\u2014B\u2014C or/and Si\u2014N\u2014B. The ceramic material preferably contains the structural unit C\u2014Si\u2014N\u2014B\u2014C and in particular the structural units C\u2014Si\u2014N\u2014B\u2014N\u2014B\u2014N\u2014Si\u2014C, C\u2014Si\u2014N\u2014B\u2014N\u2014Si\u2014N\u2014B or/and Si\u2014N\u2014B\u2014N\u2014Si\u2014N\u2014B\u2014C. The structural features indicated are linear sequences in which Si is of course always bound to four adjacent atoms, B and N are always bound to three adjacent atoms and C is in each case bound to three or four adjacent atoms. The corresponding bonds have been left out in the interests of clarity but can readily be visualized by a person skilled in the art. Branches can occur on any atom.",
        "B and Si are preferably surrounded by only N or/and C. Particular preference is given to at least one C being bound to each B or/and Si or at least to more than 50%, in particular more than 80%, of all B or/and Si. N and C can be surrounded by any atoms, with N\u2014N bonds preferably not being present.",
        "In the pyrolysis, the silicon borocarbonitride ceramic of the invention can be obtained in amorphous or at least partially crystalline form. It is preferably an amorphous silicon borocarbonitride. The silicon borocarbonitride ceramic of the invention has, in particular, a high thermal stability and is inert toward oxygen. The elements present are distributed virtually completely homogeneously within the ceramic. Crystallization of the amorphous material to form a composite ceramic comprising SiC, Si3N3 and BN can be achieved by aging at a temperature of >1700\u00b0 C. In such a crystalline composite ceramic, SiC, Si3N3 and BN crystallites, preferably on a nanometer scale, are distributed essentially fully homogeneously, i.e. are molecularly dispersed. The ceramics of the invention display, in particular, a high thermal stability. Apart from the amorphous ceramics, crystalline ceramics and processes for producing them, the present invention also provides for the use of the monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric borosilazane compounds and the amorphous and at least partly crystalline ceramic materials for producing ceramic fibers, ceramic coatings, shaped ceramic bodies, ceramic sheets or/and ceramic microstructures.",
        "The polyborosilazanes can be processed directly or as solutions in organic solvents to produce shaped bodies, fibers, sheets or coatings. The Theological properties and in particular the viscosity of the polymers can, according to the invention, be matched to requirements by the choice of the compounds of the formula (I) used, e.g. the ratio of MADB and DADB, and also by appropriate choice of the parameters for crosslinking.",
        "The shaped polyborosiloxanes can be subjected to pyrolysis and/or physical or chemical pretreatment, e.g. curing or crosslinking, to make the polymer infusible.",
        "An appropriate treatment for preparing infusible polyborosilanes is described, for example, in DE 195 30 390 A1, where infusible compounds are obtained by reaction with borane-amine adducts. As further reagents for making shaped polyborosilazane bodies, preferably green polyborosilazane fibers, infusible, it is possible to use, in particular, reactive gases such as ammonia, gaseous ethylenediamine, trichlorosilane or dichlorosilane and also boranes (e.g. B2H6). Hydrogen compounds such as HSiCl3, H2SiCl2 or B2H6 are particularly suitable for making polymers containing unsaturated side groups such as vinyl or allyl infusible by means of hydroboration or hydrosilylation reactions.",
        "Microstructures can be produced, for example, by injection molding or lithographic processes. The ceramics are particularly preferably produced in the form of fibers from which, for example, woven or braided fabrics are manufactured. These fabrics can be used as fillers for increasing the strength or toughness of other ceramics.",
        "Furthermore, the borosilazane compounds of the invention can also be used in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or physical vapor deposition (PVD). Coating of substrates by means of CVD or PVD makes it possible to produce ceramic coatings. Vapor deposition can be carried out as described in the prior art (cf., for example, DE 196 35 848 C1).",

After a hold time of 3 hours, the material is allowed to cool to room temperature and the reaction flask is connected to a distillation apparatus. The contents of the flask are then heated at 50\u00b0/h to 150\u00b0 C. under reduced pressure and this temperature is maintained until no more by-products go over. The temperature is then increased to 200\u00b0 C. over the course of 1 hour. After a hold time of 3 hours, the contents of the flask are again allowed to cool to room temperature, giving a solid, brittle, colorless, clear product.",

        "On a rotation rheometer, the viscosity is firstly determined in a temperature range from 120 to 145\u00b0 C. An Arrhenius plot gives a viscosity of 100 Pa\u00b7s at 131\u00b0 C. Oscillation tests are carried out at this temperature. The region of linear viscoelasticity is firstly determined by variation of the deformation amplitude \u03b3 from 0.01 to 10 (this range of linear viscoelasticity extends to \u03b3=1) and the variation of the storage modulus G\u2032 and the loss modulus G\u2033 on varying the oscillation frequency from 6 to 600 Hz at \u03b3=0.1 is then determined. During the test, G\u2032 rises from 9.6 Pa to 2480 Pa; G\u2033 rises from 724 Pa to 60600 Pa. This gives a loss factor (tan \u03b4) of 61.2 at \u03c9=10 Hz. According to R. Beyreuther and R. Vogel, Intern. Polymer Processing XI, Hanser Publishers, Munich 1996, a loss factor of at least 10 is necessary for a readily spinnable polymer.",
        "On a rotation rheometer, the viscosity is firstly determined in a temperature range from 70 to 100\u00b0 C. An Arrhenius plot gives a viscosity of 100 Pa\u00b7s at 88.6\u00b0 C. Oscillation tests are carried out at this temperature. The region of linear viscoelasticity is firstly determined by variation of the deformation amplitude \u03b3 from 0.01 to 10 (this range of linear viscoelasticity extends to \u03b3=0.7) and the variation of the storage modulus G\u2032 and the loss modulus G\u2033 on varying the oscillation frequency from 0.1 to 100 Hz at \u03b3=0.1 is then determined. During the test, G\u2032 rises from 55 Pa to 54000 Pa; G\u2033 rises from 0.3 Pa to 150 Pa. This gives a loss factor (tan \u03b4) of 200 at \u03c9=1 Hz.",
        "The polyborosilazane is placed in a heatable pressure vessel, melted at 90\u00b0 C. and extruded through a capillary nozzle (\u00d8 300 \u03bcm) under a pressure of pure nitrogen (p=4-8 bar). The polymer thread leaving the nozzle is wound up on a godet (takeoff velocity=300 m/min) and plaited.",
        "The green fibers are introduced into a batch reactor in which an atmosphere of pure NH3 or ethylenediamine-containing N2 (EDA content in the range from 0.5 to 1.5%) is provided. After aging for 24 hours at room temperature, the temperature of the reactor is increased to 60\u00b0 C. and aging is continued for a further 24 hours. The cured green fibers can subsequently be pyrolyzed at 1200\u00b0 C. without defects (fused regions, conglutination) occurring. The ceramic fibers typically have a tensile strength of from 1 to 1.5 GPa, a modulus of elasticity of from 100 to 150 GPa and an oxygen content of \u22661% by weight.",
        "The polyborosilazane is spun as described in Example 13 to give green fibers. However, a mixture of N2 with about 1-2% of trichlorosilane is passed into the spinning shaft during the process. It has to be ensured by means of an extraction device that no trichlorosilane reaches the spinning nozzle. The spun and cured green fibers can subsequently be pyrolyzed at 1200\u00b0 C. The ceramic fibers typically have a tensile strength of from 1 to 1.5 GPa, a modulus of elasticity of from 100 to 150 GPa and an oxygen content of \u22661% by weight."
