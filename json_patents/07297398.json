        "Much work has been done concerning low reflective plastics, particularly for plastic lenses and optical devices. One method used is vapor disposition of oxidized metal on the surface of the plastic. However, this method uses a batch process and when the substrate is large, the productivity becomes low. Another way is to apply a coating of fluoropolymer solutions. The coating is done by a dipping process and is applicable for large substrates with high productivity. Though fluoropolymers have low reflective indexes, they also have very poor adhesion with plastic substrates. Improvement in the adhesion between fluoropolymers and substrate plastics has been long sought. The purpose of this invention is to provide the technology for low reflective index and good adhesion using fluoropolymer solutions.",

        "A stirred jacketed stainless steel horizontal autoclave of 7.6 L (2 U.S. gal) capacity was used as the polymerization vessel. The autoclave was equipped with instrumentation to measure temperature and pressure and with a compressor that could feed monomer mixtures to the autoclave at the desired pressure. The autoclave was filled to 55-60% of its volume with deionized water containing 15 g of Zonyl\u00ae FS-62 surfactant (E.I. DuPont de Nemours, Wilmington, Del.?) and heated to 90\u00b0 C. It was then pressured to 3.1 MPa (450 psig) with nitrogen and vented three times. The autoclave was precharged with monomers in the desired ratio, as shown in the table below, and brought to the working pressure of 3.1 MPa (450 psig). Initiator solution was prepared by dissolving 2 g APS in 1 L of deionized water. The initiator solution was fed to the reactor at a rate of 25 mL/min for a period of five minutes and then the rate was reduced and maintained at 1 mL/min for the duration of the experiment. For Examples 36 and 38 the autoclave was operated in a batch mode. The polymerization was terminated after a 10% pressure drop was observed by venting the remaining unconverted monomers and by reducing the autoclave temperature to room temperature.",
        "For the 26.2/46.4/27.5 polymer, the autoclave was operated in a semibatch fashion in which a monomer mixture was added to the reactor to maintain constant pressure by means of the compressor as polymerization occurred. The composition of this make-up feed was different from the precharged mixture, as shown in the table below, because of the differences in monomer reactivity. The composition was selected to maintain a constant monomer composition in the reactor so compositionally homogeneous product was formed. Make-up monomer feed was admitted to the autoclave, through the compressor, by means of an automatic pressure regulated valve to maintain reactor pressure. Monomer feeds were continued until a predetermined amount to give the final latex solids was fed to the autoclave. The feed was then stopped and the contents of the autoclave were cooled and vented.",
