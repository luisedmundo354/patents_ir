        "Factors in Microphone Design and Placement",
        "Three of the major factors involved in the design and placement of microphones are polar response of a microphone, microphone interference, and proximity effect. A microphone polar response is an indication of its sensitivity to sounds originating at any point along the circumference of a circle drawn around the microphone. Microphone interference, which is also called acoustic phase cancellation, results from misplacement of a microphone so that sounds are received at different times. Proximity effect is the variation in frequency response caused by a variation in working distances from the microphone.",
        "The problem of polar response of a microphone mostly concerns a cardioid or uni-directional microphone. Microphone polar patterns may be divided into three main categories, viz. uni-directional (cardioid), bi-directional and omni-directional.",
        "In measuring polar response of microphones, the polar response curve is usually drawn on a piece of circular graph paper with approximately five progressively larger circumferences. Each circumference usually indicates a difference of sensitivity of five decibels from the next adjacent circumference. The radial lines on such a graph indicate the direction from the microphone. If a graph is examined showing a curve for a cardioid or uni-directional microphone it is noted that the response curve touches the outer circumference from the point labeled 0 degrees to a point just before the 60 degree mark to either side. From thereon the curve slopes inward until at the 180 degree point it touches one of the innermost circumferences on the other side of the 180 degree point, the curve is a mirror image of the section just described.",
        "If you consider the example of a constant level point source of sound located at the 0 degree point on the outer circumference, as the sound source moves along the circumference toward the sixty degree mark no change in sound level occurs at the microphone. As the sound source moves beyond the 60 degree point, it would have to move progressively closer to the microphone in order for the sound level arriving at the output of the microphone to remain the same. If the sound source remains at the same distance at the 180 degree point that it was at 0 degrees the microphone would attenuate the sound by 20 decibels (in this particular example). In plotting the polar response of a microphone, the sound source is usually in a fixed location and the microphone is rotated at a fixed distance. This can be carried out for any type of microphone although the graph produced is different for uni-directional microphones, bi-directional microphones and omni-directional microphones.",
        "The problem of microphone interference can be seen by examining the problem of the positioning of the sound source between two separate microphones or the positioning of a single microphone between various sound sources. If two microphones are placed in spaced relation, a sound source must be positioned exactly equidistant between them to produce an accurate reproduction of the sound. If the sound source is positioned exactly in a central location and not changed in direction, it will not be distorted by separate microphones. However, if the sound source is moved or changed in orientation with respect to the microphones an acoustic phase cancellation takes place that results in distortion of the sound reproduced by the microphones. A similar effect takes place and a single microphone is varied in position relative to separate sources of sound.",
        "If two or more microphones must be used to produce a wide angle of acceptance to cover a moving sound source, it is preferred to have the microphones relatively close together and point it at an angle to provide an angle of acceptance of about 90 degree-180 degrees. As an example of the problem that it had encountered, consider the situation of positioning a number of microphones in relation to enlarge orchestras. If one musician is working about two feet from his microphone, the next adjacent microphone should be at least 6 feet away. The three to one ratio of spacing was established from a long series of tests and is reported in the literature dealing with microphone design and application.",
        "The variation in frequency response caused by a variation in working distance from the microphone is known as proximity effect. This variation occurs in the low frequencies at distances of about 2 feet or less. The proximity effect characteristics of a single diaphragm microphone may be but to good use if the microphone is used correctly. This effect may add depth and fullness to a thin sound source. The distance should be closely maintained, however, once an effective working range is found, so that the boosted low-end response remains constant.",
        "The electro-acoustic amplified drum assembly shown in FIGS. 1-4 is mounted easily inside the drum shell and can be level compensator/mixer. This equipment mikes the internal acoustics of the drum in which it is mounted. This eliminates microphone leakage phase cancellation. The microphone can be rotated 180 degrees which allows each drum to be individually equalized to balance tone and volume and to isolate a wide range of internal frequencies.",
        "Assembly and Operation",
        "To assemble the apparatus on an existing drum, the drum set is first set up as under normal playing conditions. Next, all batter heads and hoops are removed. One then determines the location on each drum shell for placement of the electro-acoustical amplification apparatus. The acoustic and electro-acoustic sound properties are not affected by the radial location of the miking system for small size drums. One must keep in mind, however, the accessibility of external cables and jacks or snakes when determining location.",
        "A template is first taped on the selected location of the drum shell after measuring the distance between the lugs so that the centerline on the template is centered between the lugs and perpendicular to the edge of the drum. For small templates, as in the case of a five-inch snare drum, the template mounts horizontally. Each drum to be miked is removed from its stand and secured on a clean padded work surface to prevent the drum from moving when punching and drilling.",
        "A center punch is used to dimple the centers of the two large holes and the two small holes marked on the template. With the shell held firmly in place, the two larger holes and the smaller screw holes are drilled perpendicular to the shell. In the case of metal shells, the holes should be drilled by a drill press. It is recommended that a drum repair or machine shop drill the holes in metal shells. Masking tape applied to the backside of the drilling area on wood drums prevents splintering if excessive pressure is not applied when drilling. The template is discarded after the drilling operation is complete.",
        "Next, the microphone assembly is prepared for installation. The microphone assembly is normally supplied with the various parts loosely assembled. First, external locking knob 40 is unscrewed from microphone rotation shaft 29 and the nylon bushing 39 is removed therefrom. Stop plate 32 is left in place. Nylon bushing 39 is inserted into hole 38, usually \u00bd inch in diameter, from outside the shell.",
        "If the shell is especially thin, shorter bushings may be used and O-ring spacers as well, to fill the void between the shell an the end of the bushing. Shells which are substantially less than the \u215b inch thickness may require additional flat washers. From inside the shell, microphone rotation shaft 29 is inserted into the hole 33 and through bushing 39. The external locking knob 40 is screwed loosely onto the threaded end portion 41 of shaft 29. It should be noted that roll pin 36 must be positioned under stop foot 35 as indicated in FIGS. 4 and 5.",
        "Next, the pin jack 53 is pushed through stop plate 32 so that the jack hangs outside the shell. Jack housing is then slid on jack 53 and the set screw is tightened to secure the parts together. The assembled jack housing and jack are then inserted into larger hole and attached to drum shell 13 by screws. The screws extend through the aligned holes 46 or 48. Star washers are positioned on the inner end portions of the screws. Nuts are then screwed down tight to secure plate 32 and jack housing together. Next, the microphone rotation shaft 29 is held stationary with drum key 22 and locking knob 40 is turned clockwise to tighten and secure the microphone assembly.",
        "At this point, the microphone assembly 18 is securely installed in drum shell 13. Shock mount 24 is adjusted in supporting clevis 26 to the desired orientation with respect to the drumhead. Next, the drumheads are replaced and the tensioning rings tightened to the degree desired for satisfactory sound. The jack 53 is then plugged into level compensator, compressor/limiter 19 and the sound output for further signal processing 20 as shown in FIG. 1. Drum key 22 is inserted over square end 31 of shaft 29 to rotate the shaft and the microphone mount 24 and microphone 21 to the amount necessary to produce the desired pitch and tone.",
        "This electro-acoustical system is effective to reproduce accurately a wide range of frequencies. Consequently, will perform only as well as the drums are tuned. It is usually necessary on determining the desired pitch of each drum that each head be accurately tuned to itself. If necessary, drumheads may be replaced. If the drum is normally dampened to shorten the fundamental tone, it will still be necessary to use damping procedures as the amplification system has no effect on the length of the fundamental. This amplification system is effective to isolate a wide range of frequencies with its cardioid pick-up pattern. Coupled with the radial rotation by means of microphone rotation shaft 29, it is possible to isolate the frequency response to best reproduce the desired tonality of each drum.",
        "The system designed allows each drum to be individually equalized (boost and/or cut off high and low frequencies). Acoustic equalization is achieved by rotating microphone 21 and also taking advantage of proximity effect, i.e. a variation in frequency response caused by variation in working distance from the microphone. To rotate microphone 21 radially external locking nut 40 is loosened and drum key 22 is used to turn the microphone rotation shaft 29.",
        "After the desired position is located, the shaft is held steady with drum key 22 and external locking knob 40 is tightened to secure the assembly in place. The equipment has been designed to work primarily with cardioid (unidirectional) microphones. The adjustable features, however, permit its use with bi-directional and omni-directional microphones.",
        "FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate several additional embodiments of the apparatus that provide for installation in larger drum assemblies such as base drums and the like, and which provide for additional adjustments in positions of the microphone from outside the drum shell. Additional embodiments of mounting the microphone can be found in May U.S. Pat. No. 4,570,522, May U.S. Pat. No. 4,168,646.",
        "FIGS. 4 and 5 show alternate embodiment for the positioning apparatus of the microphone within a drum. These embodiments include extension shaft 124, and 229. A second clevis pin 122 on shaft 123 and tongue 121 allow the microphone to be rotated up or down with the drum housing. A slot 230 shown in FIG. 5 allows the position of the microphone to be moved racially within the shell of the drum as microphone 226 holder \u201cY\u201d 227 is moved on threaded shaft 228. Nut 40 is placed on threaded shaft 241 to retain shaft 29. A key can be used on square shaft 231 to adjust the location of the microphone with the drum.",
        "In FIGS. 6 and 7 there is shown an embodiment of the apparatus designed for amplifying base drums or other large diameter drums. In this embodiment, the microphone mount and the supporting mechanism are the same as in FIGS. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the parts are given the same reference numbers. The main difference between this embodiment and the embodiment of FIGS. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 is that an extension is provided for supporting the microphone at a greater distance from the drum shell and therefore more centrally of a larger drum. In addition, the extension is provided with a pivotal connection that allows for a manual vertical adjustment of the microphone.",
        "FIG. 6 shows a front isometric view of one embodiment of the level adjuster/mixer apparatus. The apparatus 70 consists of a housing 71 with adjustment knob 72 that adjusts the amplification or gain from a first microphone or an internal microphone, and adjustment knob 74 that adjusts the amplification or gain from a second microphone or a external microphone. A single main output knob 76 adjusts the combined level from the two microphones that is sent out of the unit. An adjustment knob 77 is also provided to adjust the amplification or sound level sent to headphones that may be connected 79 into the unit. A switch or potentiometer 73 allows the signals from the two microphones inputs to be mixed. The multiple position switch or potentiometer 73, can allow the signals from either microphone individually, finite or infinite blending of the signal from each microphone. In one embodiment, only one microphone is used and the device is used to adjust the amplification of a single microphone. A switch or button 75 inverts the phase from the two microphone inputs. The phase allows the signal from the microphones to be mixed to allow the music or sound waves to be blended in phase or in opposite phase with each other.",
        "The level from the different input microphones and a sound level display indicator 78 allows the performer to visually see and adjust the amplification to of the signal. In the preferred embodiment the level adjuster/mixer is designed for use with two input sources or microphones. Other embodiments can be used that allow for a single microphone, or more than two microphones. In the preferred embodiment knob 72 controls the sound level from the microphone placed within the drum and knob 74 controls the second microphone that is placed opposing the first microphone, outside the drum, or any other configuration that is desired by the performer. Knob 76 sets the output amplification from the two-microphone sources.",
        "FIG. 7 shows a back isometric view of one embodiment of the level compensator, compressor/limiter apparatus. Connection 84 is an electrical connection that provides power for the level compensator, compressor/limiter. In the preferred embodiment, the apparatus is powered with 12 VDC, but the apparatus could be powered internally with batteries or externally with 120 VAC or other power source. The back of the level compensator, compressor/limiter has several electrical connections. Connections 81 and 82 are for the internal and external microphone and connections respectively. Connection 86 is an output that connects the device to an additional amplifier or speakers. As was previously discussed if just one microphone is being used the level adjuster will have only one set of microphone connections. If more than two microphones are being used then the level compensator, compressor/limiter will have more connections than is shown and described in this figure. A button 88 provides excitation voltage to connected microphones. The power for excitation is typically 48 milivolts of phantom power supply, but the power source could be other varieties or types if the microphones require an alternative supply.",
        "The mixer is intended for attachment or locating near or on the drum hardware so the performer can make adjustments to the sound from each microphone as they perform. It is contemplated that some songs may require a different or unique sound from one or more of the drums, and the performer can make adjustment(s) as they are playing to get the desired sound from the drum(s)",
        "Thus specific embodiments and applications for an electro-acoustically amplified drum with a level compensator, compressor/limiter have been disclosed. It should be apparent, however, to those skilled in the art that many more modifications besides those described are possible without departing from the inventive concepts herein. Modifications besides those described may include providing a click track or tempo setter into the level compressor/limiter using a light and or audible indicator. The inventive subject matter, therefore, is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the appended claims."
