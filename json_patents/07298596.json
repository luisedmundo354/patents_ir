        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a magneto-resistance effect element for writing and reading an information signal on magnetic storage media, a magneto-resistance effect head comprising the magneto-resistance effect element, a magneto-resistance transducer system comprising the magneto-resistance effect head, and a magnetic storage system comprising the magneto-resistance transducer system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a magneto-resistance effect element that reduces noise in a read signal.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Conventionally disclosed is a magnetic read transducer that is referred to as a magneto-resistance sensor (hereinafter densities. The MR sensor allows the read element to vary the electrical resistance as the function of the strength and the orientation of a magnetic flux applied from the outside in order to measure a variation in electrical resistance, thereby detecting a magnetic signal.",
        "Such a conventional MR sensor operates based on the anisotropic magneto-resistance effect (hereinafter referred to as an AMR effect). By this effect, the component of a change in electrical resistance of the read element varies in proportion to the second power of the cosine of the angle between the orientation of magnetization and the direction of the sense current flowing through the read element. The AMR effect is described in more detail in an article entitled \u201cMemory, Storage, and Related Applications\u201d, D. A. Thompson, IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, Vol. MAG-11, No. 4, pp. 1039 (1975).",
        "In addition, disclosed lately is a more prominent magneto-resistance effect by which a change in electrical resistance of the layered magnetic sensor is caused by spin-dependent transportation of conduction electrons between magnetic layers via a non-magnetic layer and spin-dependent scattering associated therewith at layer boundaries. This magneto-resistance effect is identified by various names such as the \u201cgiant magneto-resistance effect\u201d or the \u201cspin valve effect\u201d. Such a magneto-resistance sensor is formed of suitable materials to provide improved detection sensitivity and greater changes in electrical resistance in comparison with a sensor which makes use of the AMR effect. In a MR sensor of this type, in-plane resistance between a pair of ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic layer varies in proportion to the cosine of the angle between the orientations of magnetization of the aforementioned pair of ferromagnetic layers. In Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 2-61572 submitted in July 1988, for claiming priority, described is a layered magnetic structure for providing a significant change in MR caused by an anti-parallel alignment of the orientations of magnetization in the magnetic layers.",
        "On the other hand, such a phenomenon has been recently discovered in which a relative change in orientation of magnetization of ferromagnetic bodies disposed above and below a very thin insulation layer (barrier layer) through which a tunneling current flows, causes a change in electrical resistance. And, the layered structure made up of the ferromagnetic layer, the barrier layer, and the ferromagnetic layer is termed a ferromagnetic tunnel junction. For example, ferromagnetic tunnel junctions are introduced in \u201cJournal of Applied Physics\u201d, Vol. 79 (8), No. 15, pp. 4724 (1996).",
        "On the other hand, in a shield type element that makes use of a ferromagnetic tunnel junction, it is necessary to conduct a sense current for detecting a change in electrical resistance of the element in perpendicular relation to the tunnel junction. However, the structure similar to the shield type element employing the conventional spin valve presents a problem that the sense current flows through a vertical bias layer for controlling the magnetic domain of the free layer disposed near the tunnel junction to reduce the current flowing through the tunnel junction, thereby providing a reduced change in electrical resistance.",
        "In order to overcome this problem, a read head was disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 10-162327 submitted on Nov. 27, 1996, for claiming priority. The read head, employing a ferromagnetic tunnel junction film, has a structure in which the vertical bias layer is not in contact with the free layer.",
        "FIG. 1 is a fragmentary sectional view illustrating the prior-art ferromagnetic tunnel head described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 10-162327. FIG. 1 illustrates the structure of a patterned ferromagnetic tunnel junction element, or a magneto-resistance effect element 30, having an insulation layer 11 disposed between a vertical bias layer 2b and a free layer 3b. This structure can prevent a sense current from flowing through the vertical bias layer 2b.",
        "However, since the insulation layer 11 disposed between the vertical bias layer 2b and the free layer 3b acts also as a magnetic separation layer, it is difficult in the magneto-resistance effect element 30 to apply a vertical bias magnetic field of a sufficient magnitude to the free layer 3b. This presents such a problem that the magnetic domain of the free layer 3b is controlled insufficiently to cause the hysteresis of the R-H loop to increase for the shield type sensor, thereby providing a high-noise-level read signal upon reading magnetic information on a storage medium.",
        "In order to overcome this problem, a read head was disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 10-255231 submitted on Mar. 7, 1997, 1996, for claiming priority. The read head, employing a ferromagnetic tunnel junction film, has a structure in which the vertical bias layer is in contact with the free layer.",
        "FIGS. 2 and 3 are fragmentary sectional views of the ferromagnetic tunnel head described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 10-255231. FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate the structure of a layered body comprising the free layer 3b, the non-magnetic layer 4, and the fixed layer 5, in which the vertical bias layer 2b is in direct contact with the end portion of either the free layer 3b or the fixed layer 5.",
        "However, the structure shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 presents the following problem. As will be described in the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the read head, which was actually fabricated to the structure shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, caused the sense current to flow into the vertical bias layer 2b and thus insufficiently flow through the non-magnetic layer 4. It is thereby made impossible to provide sufficient output of the sense current. The low output made it impossible to provide sufficient (S/N) ratios and bit error rates. As described above, this structure may make it possible in principle to prevent the sense current from flowing through the vertical bias layer 2b and thereby bypassing the non-magnetic layer 4. However, the vertical bias layer 2b is disposed in close proximity to the end portion of the non-magnetic layer 4 in the layered body made up of the free layer 3b, the non-magnetic layer 4, and the fixed layer 5. Thus, it is difficult to fabricate this structure precisely enough to prevent the sense current from flowing through the vertical bias layer 2b and thereby bypassing the non-magnetic layer 4.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide a magneto-resistance effect element, a magneto-resistance effect head, a magneto-resistance transducer system, and a magnetic storage system, which can prevent the sense current from flowing into the vertical bias layer, provide a read signal of a low noise level, and a good (S/N) ratio and bit error rate.",
        "A magneto-resistance effect element according to the present invention comprises a lower conductive layer and a free layer provided on the lower conductive layer and having an orientation of magnetization varied by a magnetic field applied thereto. The magneto-resistance effect element also comprises a non-magnetic layer provided on top of the free layer, a fixed layer provided on the non-magnetic layer and having a pinned orientation of magnetization, and a vertical bias layer, provided on the lower conductive layer, for applying a magnetic field to the free layer. The magneto-resistance effect element is adapted that the free layer is greater in length in the direction of a magnetic field applied thereto by the vertical bias layer than the fixed layer, and a sense current for detecting a change in electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer flows substantially in perpendicular relation to the non-magnetic layer.",
        "In the present invention, the free layer is made greater in length than the fixed layer in the direction of magnetic field applied by the vertical bias layer, thereby allowing only the free layer to be disposed near the vertical bias layer. This allows the vertical bias layer to effectively apply a vertical bias magnetic field to the free layer and makes it possible to prevent the leakage of a sense current from the fixed layer to the vertical bias layer. This allows almost all the sense current, which is applied to the magneto-resistance effect element to detect a change in electrical resistance, to flow through the non-magnetic layer, thereby making it possible to reduce noise in the read signal waveform and improve the (S/N) ratio and bit error rate. Incidentally, that the sense current flows substantially in perpendicular relation to the aforementioned non-magnetic layer means that the sense current flows in orthogonal relation thereto to such an extent as to measure a change in electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer without any trouble. In addition, the direction of the magnetic field applied by the aforementioned vertical bias layer agrees with the direction perpendicular to the direction in which the aforementioned sense current flows on a plane parallel to an air bearing surface of the magneto-resistance effect head.",
        "In addition, it is preferable that the lower conductive layer has a recessed portion, and at least part of the vertical bias layer is buried in the recessed portion.",
        "This makes it possible to place the vertical bias layer and the free layer to be flush with each other, and allows the vertical bias layer to apply a vertical bias magnetic field smoothly and effectively to the free layer.",
        "Furthermore, at least part of the free layer can be brought into direct contact with the vertical bias layer. Alternatively, the underlying layer for free layer may be provided below the free layer such that the underlying layer for free layer is brought into contact with the vertical bias layer. A vertical bias layer protective layer may be provided on the vertical bias layer such that the vertical bias layer protective layer is brought into contact with the free layer or the underlying layer for free layer.",
        "This allows the vertical bias layer to apply a vertical bias magnetic field more positively and effectively to the free layer.",
        "A magneto-resistance effect element according to the present invention comprises a lower conductive layer, a magnetic layer provided on the lower conductive layer, and a free layer provided on the magnetic layer and having an orientation of magnetization varied by a magnetic field coupled magnetically to the magnetic layer and applied thereto. The magneto-resistance effect element also comprises a non-magnetic layer provided on the free layer, a fixed layer provided on the non-magnetic layer and having a pinned orientation of magnetization, and a vertical bias layer, provided on the lower conductive layer, for applying a magnetic field to the free layer. The magneto-resistance effect element is adapted that the magnetic layer is greater in length in the direction of a magnetic field applied thereto by the vertical bias layer than the free layer, and a sense current for detecting a change in electrical resistance of the non-magnetic body flows substantially in perpendicular relation to the non-magnetic layer.",
        "In addition, the magnetic layer can be magnetically coupled to the free layer by anti-ferromagnetic coupling or ferromagnetic coupling. Furthermore, a second non-magnetic layer may be provided between the magnetic layer and the free layer.",
        "In the present invention, a vertical bias magnetic field is once applied to the magnetic layer from the vertical bias layer, and then the vertical bias magnetic field is applied to the free layer from the magnetic layer. The vertical bias magnetic field is thus applied to the free layer through the two steps, thereby facilitating the control of the vertical bias magnetic field applied to the free layer. In addition, in the direction of the magnetic field applied by the vertical bias layer, the free layer is made greater in length than the free layer, thereby placing only the magnetic layer near the vertical bias layer. This allows the vertical bias layer to effectively apply the vertical bias magnetic field to the magnetic layer and makes it possible to prevent the leakage of sense current from the layered body to the vertical bias layer, thereby allowing almost all sense current to conduct through the non-magnetic layer.",
        "Furthermore, at least part of the magnetic layer can be brought into direct contact with the vertical bias layer. Alternatively, the underlying layer for magnetic layer may be provided below the magnetic layer such that the underlying layer for magnetic layer is brought into contact with the vertical bias layer. A vertical bias layer protective layer may be provided on the vertical bias layer such that the vertical bias layer protective layer is brought into contact with the magnetic layer or the underlying layer for magnetic layer.",
        "This allows the vertical bias layer to apply a vertical bias magnetic field more positively and effectively to the magnetic layer.",
        "A magneto-resistance effect element according to the present invention comprises a lower conductive layer, a fixed layer provided on the lower conductive layer and having a pined orientation of magnetization, and a non-magnetic layer provided on the fixed layer. The magneto-resistance effect element also comprises a free layer provided on the non-magnetic layer and having an orientation of magnetization varied by a magnetic field applied thereto, a magnetic layer provided on the free layer and magnetically coupled to the free layer, and a vertical bias layer for applying a magnetic field to the magnetic layer.

        "In addition, the magnetic layer can be magnetically coupled to the free layer by anti-ferromagnetic coupling or ferromagnetic coupling. Furthermore, the second non-magnetic layer may be provided between the magnetic layer and the free layer.",
        "A magneto-resistance effect element according to the present invention comprises a lower conductive layer, a fixed layer provided on the lower conductive layer and having a pinned orientation of magnetization, and a first non-magnetic layer provided on the fixed layer. The magneto-resistance effect element also comprises a free layer provided on the first non-magnetic layer and having an orientation of magnetization varied by a magnetic field applied thereto. The magneto-resistance effect element further comprises a first magnetic layer provided on the free layer and magnetically coupled to the free layer, a second magnetic layer provided on the first magnetic layer and magnetically coupled to the first magnetic layer, and a vertical bias layer for applying a magnetic field to the first and second magnetic layers. The magneto-resistance effect element is adapted that a sense current for detecting a change in electrical resistance of the first non-magnetic layer flows substantially in perpendicular relation to the first non-magnetic layer.",
        "In addition, the first magnetic layer and the second magnetic layer are equal to or greater than the free layer in length in the direction of the magnetic field applied by the vertical bias layer, respectively.",
        "Furthermore, a second non-magnetic layer can be provided between the free layer and the first magnetic layer, while a third non-magnetic layer can be provided between the first magnetic layer and the second magnetic layer. In addition, an underlying layer for fixing layer may be provided under the fixing layer.",
        "In the present invention, a vertical bias magnetic field can be once applied to a three-layered film made up of the first magnetic layer, the third non-magnetic layer, and the second magnetic layer, from the vertical bias layer and then to the free layer from the three-layered film. As described above, the vertical bias magnetic field is applied to the free layer from the vertical bias layer through two steps, thereby facilitating the control of the vertical bias magnetic field applied to the free layer.",
        "Still furthermore, the product of saturation magnetization and film thickness of the first magnetic layer can be substantially equal to the product of saturation magnetization and film thickness of the second magnetic layer, and the three-layered film made up of the first magnetic layer, the third non-magnetic layer, and the second magnetic layer can be a layered antiferromagnetic body.",
        "This eliminates the sensitivity of the three-layered film to magnetic fields but provides only the free layer with the sensitivity to magnetic fields. For this reason, when the magneto-resistance effect element is incorporated into a read head, the read track width is determined only by the width of the free layer, thus making it possible to prevent the broadening of the effective track width. Incidentally, \u201cbeing substantially equal\u201d means \u201cbeing equal to such an extent that an effect of reduction in sensitivity of the three-layered film to magnetic fields can be recognized\u201d.",
        "In addition, it is desirable that at least part of the first magnetic layer is in direct contact with the vertical bias layer.

A vertical bias layer protective layer may be provided on the vertical bias layer such that the vertical bias layer protective layer is brought into contact with the first magnetic layer or the first underlying layer for magnetic layer. Similarly, it is desirable that at least part of the second magnetic layer is in direct contact with the vertical bias layer. Alternatively, a second underlying layer for magnetic layer may be provided below the second magnetic layer such that the second underlying layer for magnetic layer is brought into contact with the vertical bias layer.

        "Now, the operation of the magneto-resistance effect head 61a is explained below. When an external magnetic field is applied to the magneto-resistance effect head 61a, a magnetic field is applied to the free layer 3b via the vertical bias layer 2b, causing the orientation of magnetization of the free layer 3b to change in accordance with the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field applied thereto. And, since the orientation of magnetization of the fixed layer 5 is pinned by the fixing layer 6b, a change occurs in orientation of magnetization between the fixed layer 5 and the free layer 3b, causing a change in electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer 4. In this state, the lower conductive layer 1 and the upper conductive layer 15 allow a sense current to flow in the direction perpendicular to the non-magnetic layer 4 to measure the electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer 4, thereby making it possible to detect the external magnetic field.",
        "Now, an effect of this embodiment is described. As shown in FIG. 10, the magneto-resistance effect head 61a according to this embodiment has the free layer 3b which is greater than the fixed layer 5 in length, and only the free layer 3b is disposed near the vertical bias layer 2b. This allows the vertical bias layer 2b to apply a magnetic field positively and effectively to the free layer 3b and makes it possible to prevent the leakage of a sense current from the fixed layer 5 to the vertical bias layer 2b. This allows almost all the sense current applied to flow through the non-magnetic layer 4, thereby improving the performance of the magneto-resistance effect head 61a.",
        "Furthermore, part of the direction of thickness of the patterned underlying layer for vertical bias layer 2a and the vertical bias layer 2b is buried in the recessed portion 1a of the lower conductive layer 1. This provides a gradual slope to the end portion of the underlying layer for vertical bias layer 2a and the vertical bias layer 2b, thereby allowing the vertical bias layer 2b to apply a vertical bias magnetic field to the free layer 3b more effectively.",
        "FIGS. 11 and 12 are fragmentary sectional views illustrating a variation of the magneto-resistance effect element according to this embodiment. FIG. 11 illustrates a magneto-resistance effect element 31b having the free layer 3b patterned to bring the end portion thereof into contact with that of the vertical bias layer 2b.",
        "On the other hand, FIG. 12 illustrates a magneto-resistance effect element 31c having the free layer 3b patterned to make the end portion thereof overlap that of the vertical bias layer 2b. Like the magneto-resistance effect element 31a, the magneto-resistance effect element 31c shown in FIGS. 11, 12 can constitute the magneto-resistance effect head.",
        "Incidentally, this embodiment has shown that the non-magnetic layer 4 is patterned in conjunction with the fixed layer 5, the fixing layer 6b, and the upper layer 7. However, the non-magnetic layer 4 can be extended like the free layer 3b. Alternatively, the non-magnetic layer 4 may be patterned to be larger than the fixing layer 6b and the fixing layer 6b and smaller than the free layer 3b.",
        "In addition, the underlying layer for vertical bias layer 2a, the underlying layer for free layer 3a, and the upper layer 7 may be omitted, and a protective layer for protecting the vertical bias layer may be provided on top of the vertical bias layer 2b.",
        "Furthermore, this embodiment has shown that the lower shield layer 16 and the lower conductive layer 1 are provided separately. However, the lower shield layer 16 and lower conductive layer 1 may be a common layer. In this case, the lower conductive layer 1 is omitted. In addition, the upper conductive layer 15 and the upper shield 17 may be a common layer. In this case, the upper conductive layer 15 is omitted. This allows the gap between the top and bottom shield layers to be made smaller. Furthermore, an upper gap layer may be provided between the upper conductive layer 15 and the shield layer 17 or a lower gap layer may be provided between the lower shield layer 16 and the lower conductive layer 1.",
        "Now, a second embodiment of the present invention is described below. FIGS. 13-21 are fragmentary sectional views illustrating the steps of a method for fabricating a magneto-resistance effect head according to this embodiment in the order in which they appear.",
        "First, as shown in FIG. 13, the lower shield layer 16 and the lower conductive layer 1 are successively formed on a substrate (not shown).",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 14, the photoresist 20 having the opening portion 20a is formed on top of the lower conductive layer 1 which is etched by dry etching or like means to form the recessed portion 1a on the surface of the lower conductive layer 1.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 15, the underlying layer for vertical bias layer 2a and the vertical bias layer 2b are deposited on top of the lower conductive layer 1 after the photoresist 20 has been removed.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 16, the photoresist 21 is formed to cover the region having the recessed portion 1a arranged immediately below the vertical bias layer 2b and provide an opening portion 21a for the region having no recessed portion 1a arranged immediately below the vertical bias layer 2b. Subsequently, with the photoresist 21 being employed as a mask, the underlying layer for vertical bias layer 2a and the vertical bias layer 2b are etched and thereby patterned by dry etching or like means.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 17, on top of the lower conductive layer 1 and vertical bias layer 2b, formed and layered in the following order are the underlying layer for free layer 3a, the free layer 3b, the non-magnetic layer 4, the fixed layer 5, the fixing layer 6b, and the upper layer 7.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 18, a photoresist 22 is provided to cover the region having no vertical bias layer 2b arranged immediately below the upper layer 7.

Then, as shown in FIG. 21, after the photoresist 23 has been removed, the upper conductive layer 15 is deposited on top of the upper layer 7 and the insulation layer 11 and then a photoresist (not shown) is formed. With this photoresist being employed as a mask, the upper conductive layer 15 is patterned by dry etching or like means. Then, this photoresist is removed to form the upper shield layer 17 thereon and thus a magneto-resistance effect head 62a is formed.",
        "Now, the structure of the magneto-resistance effect head 62a according to this embodiment is described below. As shown in FIG. 21, the magneto-resistance effect head 62a according to this embodiment has a different shape of the underlying layer for free layer 3a and the free layer 3b in comparison with the magneto-resistance effect head 61a according to the first embodiment shown in FIG. 10. In this embodiment, the end portion of the underlying layer for free layer 3a and the free layer 3b are flush and in contact with that of the underlying layer for vertical bias layer 2a and the vertical bias layer 2b. In the magneto-resistance effect head 62a according to this embodiment, the structure and operation thereof is the same as those of the magneto-resistance effect head 61a according to the aforementioned first embodiment except for the shape of the underlying layer for free layer 3a and the free layer 3b.",
        "Incidentally, in this embodiment, it has been explained in which the non-magnetic layer 4 is patterned in conjunction with the fixed layer 5, the fixing layer 6b, and the upper layer 7. However, like the first embodiment, the non-magnetic layer 4 may be extended as the free layer 3b. Alternatively, the non-magnetic layer 4 may be patterned to be larger than the pattern of the fixed layer 5, the fixing layer 6b, and the upper layer 7, and smaller than the pattern of the free layer 3b.",
        "Furthermore, in this embodiment, it has been explained in which the upper conductive layer 15 is patterned, however, the upper conductive layer 15 may be extended without being patterned.",

With the photoresist 21 being employed as a mask, the non-magnetic layer 4, the fixed layer 5, the fixing layer 6b, and the upper layer 7 are patterned by dry etching or like means. Then, the periphery of the non-magnetic layer 4, the fixed layer 5, the fixing layer 6b, and the upper layer 7 is buried in the insulation layer 11.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 27, the photoresist 21 is removed to form the photoresist 22, patterned to cover a region broader than that covered by the photoresist 21, at a position on the upper layer 7 and the insulation layer 11 where the photoresist 21 has once been formed. With the photoresist 22 being employed as a mask, the underlying layer for free layer 3a, the free layer 3b, and the insulation layer 11 are etched by dry etching or like means and thereby patterned. Subsequently, this etched region is buried in the insulation layer 11b to thereby form a magneto-resistance effect element 32b.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 28, the photoresist 22 is removed. Thereafter, the upper conductive layer 15 is deposited on top of the upper layer 7, the insulation layer 11, and the insulation layer 11b to form a photoresist (not shown), which is in turn employed to pattern the upper conductive layer 15 by dry etching or like means. Then, this photoresist is removed and the upper shield layer 17 is formed thereupon to form a magneto-resistance effect head 62b.",
        "The magneto-resistance effect head 62b formed according to this embodiment has the same structure and operation as those of the magneto-resistance effect head 62a according to the second embodiment except that the insulation layers 11 and 11b are formed through two steps.",
        "Now, a magneto-resistance effect head according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention and the method for fabricating the head are described below. FIGS. 29-34 are fragmentary sectional views illustrating the steps of the method for fabricating the magneto-resistance effect head according to this embodiment in the order in which they appear.",
        "First, by the steps shown in FIGS. 4-6 in the first embodiment, a layered body as shown in FIG. 6 is formed.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 29, on top of the lower conductive layer 1 and the vertical bias layer 2b, the following layers are formed and layered.

Then, the insulation layer 11 is formed to bury the etched portion therein, thus forming a magneto-resistance effect element 33a on top of the lower shield layer 16.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 31, the photoresist 21 is removed and the upper conductive layer 15 is deposited on the upper layer 7 and the insulation layer 11. Then, a photoresist (not shown) is formed to pattern the upper conductive layer 15 by dry etching or the like and thereafter the photoresist is removed, on which the upper shield layer 17 is formed, thereby forming a magneto-resistance effect head 63a.",
        "Now, the structure of the magneto-resistance effect head 63a according to this embodiment is described below. As shown in FIG. 31, the magneto-resistance effect head 63a is characterized in that the magnetic layer 8b is provided below the free layer 3b via the non-magnetic layer 9.",

Furthermore, the upper conductive layer 15 is patterned on the upper layer 7 and the insulation layer 11, and the upper shield layer 17 is provided on the upper conductive layer 15.",
        "In the aforementioned structure, the magnetic layer 8b is to transmit a vertical bias magnetic field applied by the vertical bias layer 2b to the free layer 3b by means of magnetic coupling such as ferromagnetic coupling, antiferromagnetic coupling, or magneto-static coupling. In addition, the second non-magnetic layer 9 allows the component material and the film thickness thereof to control the magnetic coupling between the magnetic layer 8b and the free layer 3b. The underlying layer for magnetic layer 8a is to improve film quality such as the crystallization properties of the magnetic layer 8b and provide good magnetic properties for the magnetic layer 8b. Incidentally, the non-magnetic layer 4 is an insulation layer for conducting a tunneling current therethrough, whereas the second non-magnetic layer 9 is an electrically conductive layer for controlling the magnetic coupling between the magnetic layer 8b and the free layer 3b.",
        "As materials forming the magnetic layer 8b, employed are alloys such as NiFe, Co, CoFe, NiFeCo, FeCo, CoFeB, CoZrMo, CoZrNb, CoZr, CoZrTa, CoHf, CoTa, CoTaHf, CoNbHf, CoZrNb, CoHfPd, CoTaZrNb, and CoZrMoNi, a single-layer film of an amorphous magnetic material, a mixture film, or a multi-layered film. In particular, NiFe, Co, CoFe, NiFeCo, or FeCo is favorable. On the other hand, as an additive element, it is possible to use one or more types of elements selected from the group consisting of Ta, Hf, Zr, W, Cr, Ti, Mo, Pt, Ni, Ir, Cu, Ag, Co, Zn, Ru, Rh, Re, Au, Os, Pd, Nb, and V.",

        "The component material and the function of other layers of the magneto-resistance effect head 63a according to this embodiment are the same as those of each of the layers of the magneto-resistance effect head 61a according to the aforementioned first embodiment.",
        "Now, described below is the operation of the magneto-resistance effect head 63a. Application of an external magnetic field to the magneto-resistance effect head 63a will cause a magnetic field to be applied to the magnetic layer 8b via the vertical bias layer 2b. Then, a vertical bias magnetic field is applied by the magnetic layer 8b via the second non-magnetic layer 9 to the free layer 3b by means of magnetic coupling such as ferromagnetic coupling, antiferromagnetic coupling, or magneto-static coupling. And, the orientation of magnetization of the free layer 3b changes in accordance with the direction and the magnitude of this magnetic field. Since the orientation of magnetization of the fixed layer 5 is pinned by the fixing layer 6b, a change occurs in orientation of magnetization between the fixed layer 5 and the free layer 3b, causing a change in electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer 4. In this state, the lower conductive layer 1 and the upper conductive layer 15 allow a sense current to flow in the direction perpendicular to the non-magnetic layer 4 to measure the electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer 4, thereby making it possible to detect the external magnetic field.",
        "Now, an effect of this embodiment is described below. In the magneto-resistance effect head 63a according to this embodiment, a vertical bias magnetic field is applied to the free layer 3b from the vertical bias layer 2b through two steps of process, thereby assuring the application of the vertical bias magnetic field and facilitating the control of the amount of application of the magnetic field. In addition, as shown in FIG. 31, the free layer 3b and the fixed layer 5 are not arranged near the vertical bias layer 2b but only the magnetic layer 8b is disposed near the vertical bias layer 2b. This allows the vertical bias layer 2b to apply a magnetic field to the magnetic layer 8b positively and effectively, also making it possible to prevent the leakage of sense current from the free layer 3b or the fixed layer 5 to the vertical bias layer 2b.",
        "FIG. 32 and FIG. 33 are fragmentary sectional views illustrating a variation of the magneto-resistance effect element according to this embodiment. FIG. 32 illustrates a magneto-resistance effect element 33b in which the magnetic layer 8b is patterned so that the end portion of the magnetic layer 8b is in contact with that of the vertical bias layer 2b.",
        "In addition, FIG. 33 illustrates a magneto-resistance effect element 33c in which the magnetic layer 8b is patterned so that the end portion of the magnetic layer 8b overlaps the vertical bias layer 2b. The magneto-resistance effect elements 33b, 33c, shown in FIGS. 32 and 33, can constitute the magneto-resistance effect head.",
        "Incidentally, in this embodiment, it has been explained in which the second non-magnetic layer 9, the free layer 3b, and the non-magnetic layer 4 are patterned in conjunction with the fixed layer 5, the fixing layer 6b, and the upper layer 7. However, the second non-magnetic layer 9, the free layer 3b, and the non-magnetic layer 4 may be extended as the magnetic layer 8b or may be patterned to be larger than the pattern of the fixed layer 5, the fixing layer 6b, and the upper layer 7 and smaller than the pattern of the magnetic layer 8b. Furthermore, the pattern of the second non-magnetic layer 9 may be extended further than that of the free layer 3b or the pattern of the free layer 3b may be extended further than that of the non-magnetic layer 4.",
        "In addition, the underlying layer for vertical bias layer 2a, the underlying layer for magnetic layer 8a, the second non-magnetic layer 9, and the upper layer 7 may be omitted, and a protective layer for protecting the vertical bias layer may be provided on top of the vertical bias layer 2b.",
        "Furthermore, this embodiment has shown that the lower shield layer 16 and the lower conductive layer 1 provided separately. However, like the aforementioned embodiments 1 to 3, the lower shield layer 16 and lower conductive layer 1 may be a common layer. In this case, the lower conductive layer 1 is omitted. In addition, the upper shield 17 and the upper conductive layer 15 may be a common layer. In this case, the upper conductive layer 15 is omitted. This allows the gap between the top and bottom shield layers to be made smaller. Furthermore, an upper gap insulation layer may be provided between the upper conductive layer 15 and the shield layer 17 or a lower gap insulation layer may be provided between the lower shield layer 16 and the lower conductive layer 1.",

Then, the periphery of the pattern of the second non-magnetic layer 9, the free layer 3b, the non-magnetic layer 4, the fixed layer 5, the fixing layer 6b, and the upper layer 7 is buried in the insulation layer 11, thereby forming a magneto-resistance effect element 34a on top of the lower shield layer 16.",

Application of an external magnetic field to the magneto-resistance effect head 65a will cause the magnetic field to be applied to the magnetic layer 8b via the vertical bias layer 2b. Subsequently, a vertical bias magnetic field is applied from the magnetic layer 8b to the free layer 3b via the second non-magnetic layer 9 by means of a magnetic coupling such as ferromagnetic coupling, anti-ferromagnetic coupling, or magneto-static coupling. And, the orientation of magnetization of the free layer 3b changes in accordance with the direction and magnitude of this magnetic field. Since the orientation of magnetization of the fixed layer is pinned by the fixing layer 6b, a change occurs in orientation of magnetization between the fixed layer 5 and the free layer 3b, causing a change in electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer 4. In this state, the lower conductive layer 1 and the upper conductive layer 15 allow a sense current to flow in the direction perpendicular to the non-magnetic layer 4 to measure the electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer 4, thereby making it possible to detect the external magnetic field.",
        "Now, an effect of this embodiment is described below. In the magneto-resistance effect head 65a according to this embodiment, a vertical bias magnetic field is applied to the free layer 3b from the vertical bias layer 2b through two steps of process, thereby assuring the application of the vertical bias magnetic field and facilitating the control of the amount of application of the magnetic field.",
        "Incidentally, in this embodiment, it has been explained in which the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a, the fixing layer 6b, the fixed layer 5, the first non-magnetic layer 4, the free layer 3b, and the second non-magnetic layer 9 are patterned in the same way. However, it is necessary to pattern at least the free layer 3b but not necessary to pattern the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a, the fixing layer 6b, the fixed layer 5, and the first non-magnetic layer 4. In addition, the pattern of the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a may be extended further than that of the fixing layer 6b. The pattern of the fixing layer 6b may be extended further than that of the fixed layer 5. The pattern of the fixed layer 5 may be extended further than that of the non-magnetic layer 4. The pattern of the non-magnetic layer 4 may be extended further than that of the free layer 3b. Furthermore, this embodiment has shown that the upper surface of the insulation layer 11 is lower than that of the pattern of the free layer 3b. However, the upper surface of the insulation layer 11 may be equal in height to the upper surface of the pattern of the free layer 3b and higher than the upper surface of the pattern of the free layer 3b.",

        "Now, an eighth embodiment according to the present invention is described below. FIGS. 58-64 are fragmentary sectional views illustrating the steps of a method for fabricating a magneto-resistance effect head according to this embodiment in the order in which they appear.",
        "First, as shown in FIG. 58, the lower shield layer 16 and the lower conductive layer 1 are successively formed on a substrate (not shown).",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 59, formed and layered in the following order are the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a, the fixing layer 6b, the fixed layer 5, the first non-magnetic layer 4, the free layer 3b, and the second non-magnetic layer.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 60, the photoresist 20 having the opening portion 20a is formed on top of the second non-magnetic layer 9. Then, patterned are the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a, the fixing layer 6b, the fixed layer 5, the first non-magnetic layer 4, the free layer 3b, and the second non-magnetic layer 9 by dry etching or like means. Thus, a pattern 29c is formed which is made up of the patterned the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a, the fixing layer 6b, the fixed layer 5, the first non-magnetic layer 4, the free layer 3b, and the second non-magnetic layer 9, which have been patterned.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 61, the insulation layer 11 is formed to bury the pattern 29c.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 62, on the pattern 29c and the insulation layer 11, formed are the first magnetic layer 8b, the third non-magnetic layer 13, the second magnetic layer 12, and the vertical bias layer 2b.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 63, the photoresist 21 having the opening portion 21a is formed immediately above the patterned non-magnetic layer 9. Then, with the photoresist 21 being employed as a mask, the vertical bias layer 2b is patterned, thereby forming a magneto-resistance effect element 36a.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 64, the photoresist 21 is removed. Then, the upper conductive layer 15 is deposited on the exposed portion of the second magnetic layer 12 and the pattern of the vertical bias layer 2b, and a photoresist (not shown) is formed to perform patterning by dry etching or like means. Thereafter, the photoresist is removed and the upper shield layer 17 is formed thereupon, thereby forming a magneto-resistance effect head 66a.",
        "Now, the structure of the magneto-resistance effect head 66a according to this embodiment is described below. As shown in FIG. 64, the magneto-resistance effect head 66a is provided with the lower shield layer 16, and the lower conductive layer 1 is provided on top of the lower shield layer 16. Thus, on top of the lower conductive layer 1, formed is the pattern 29c made up of the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a, the fixing layer 6b, the fixed layer 5, the first non-magnetic layer 4, the free layer 3b, and the second non-magnetic layer 9, which have been patterned.

        "In addition, the third non-magnetic layer 13 allows the component material and the film thickness thereof to control the magnetic coupling between the second magnetic layer 12 and the magnetic layer 8b. Materials forming the third non-magnetic layer 13 include a single material of one type, a mixture of materials of two or more types, a compound of two or more types, or a multi-layered film formed of materials of two or more types, which are selected from the group consisting of Ti, V, Cr, Co, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, Si, Al, Ta, Pt, and Ni.

        "Now, the operation of the magneto-resistance effect head 66a according to this embodiment is described below. When an external magnetic field is applied to the magneto-resistance effect head 66a, the magnetic field is applied to the second magnetic layer 12 via the vertical bias layer 2b. Subsequently, a vertical bias magnetic field is applied from the second magnetic layer 12 to the magnetic layer 8b via the third non-magnetic layer 13 by means of magnetic coupling such as ferromagnetic coupling, anti-ferromagnetic coupling, or magneto-static coupling. Furthermore, the vertical bias magnetic field is applied from the magnetic layer 8b to the free layer 3b via the second non-magnetic layer 9 by means of magnetic coupling such as ferromagnetic coupling, anti-ferromagnetic coupling, or magneto-static coupling.",
        "The orientation of magnetization of the free layer 3b changes in accordance with the direction and magnitude of this magnetic field. Since the orientation of magnetization of the fixed layer 5 is pinned by the fixing layer 6b, a change occurs in orientation of magnetization between the fixed layer 5 and the free layer 3b, causing a change in electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer 4. In this state, the lower conductive layer 1 and the upper conductive layer 15 allow a sense current to flow in the direction perpendicular to the non-magnetic layer 4 to measure the electrical resistance of the non-magnetic layer 4, thereby making it possible to detect the external magnetic field.",
        "Now, an effect of this embodiment is described below. In the magneto-resistance effect head 65a according to this embodiment, a vertical bias magnetic field is applied to the free layer 3b from the vertical bias layer 2b through three steps of process, thereby assuring the application of the vertical bias magnetic field and facilitating the control of the amount of application of the magnetic field.",
        "Another advantage of the magneto-resistance effect head 65a is provided when the layered film made up of the magnetic layer 8b, the third non-magnetic layer 13, and the second magnetic layer 12 produces a strong anti-ferromagnetic coupling between the magnetic layer 8b and the second magnetic layer 12. The advantage is also provided when the magnetization of the magnetic layer 8 (the product of the saturation magnetization and the film thickness) is made substantially equal to that of the second magnetic layer 12. In this case, the foregoing layered film is turned to a merged film having effectively no magnetization, thus providing no sensitivity to the magnetic field of an external magnetic field applied. For this reason, in this case, only the free layer 3b, in the structure of FIG. 64, has sensitivity to an external magnetic field. Thus, the width of the tracks is determined only by the pattern width of the free layer 3b when the magneto-resistance effect head 65a functions as the read head. This is advantageous in making a narrow-track head. Incidentally, even in this case, a vertical bias magnetic field is applied precisely to the free layer 3b through the aforementioned process. In addition, that the magnetization of the magnetic layer 8b is substantially equal to that of the second magnetic layer 12 means that they are equal to each other to the degree that the aforementioned effect is recognized.",
        "Incidentally, in this embodiment, the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a, the second non-magnetic layer 9, the third non-magnetic layer 13, and the upper layer 7 may be omitted. In addition, an underlying layer for vertical bias layer may be provided on the lower portion of the vertical bias layer 2b. In some cases, a protective layer for protecting a vertical bias layer is provided on the vertical bias layer 2b, and an upper layer is provided on the second magnetic layer 12.",
        "Furthermore, in this embodiment, it has been explained in which the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a, the fixing layer 6b, the fixed layer 5, the first non-magnetic layer 4, the free layer 3b, and the second non-magnetic layer 9 are patterned in the same way. However, it is necessary to pattern at least the free layer 3b but not necessary to pattern the layered film made up of the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a, the fixing layer 6b, the fixed layer 5, and the first non-magnetic layer 4. In addition, the pattern of the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a may be extended further than that of the fixing layer 6b. The pattern of the fixing layer 6b may be extended further than that of the fixed layer 5. The pattern of the fixed layer 5 may be extended further than that of the non-magnetic layer 4. The pattern of the non-magnetic layer 4 may be extended further than that of the free layer 3b. In addition, this embodiment has shown such that the upper surface of the insulation layer 11 is equal in height to that of the pattern of the free layer 3b. However, the upper surface of the insulation layer 11 may be lower than that of the pattern of the free layer 3b or higher than the upper surface of the pattern of the free layer 3b.

Then, the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a, the fixing layer 6b, the fixed layer 5, the first non-magnetic layer 4, the free layer 3b, and the second non-magnetic layer 9 are patterned by dry etching or like means, thereby forming a pattern 29e made up of these layers.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 81, the insulation layer 11 is formed around the pattern 29e to bury the pattern 29e therein. And, the insulation layer 11 is made equal in height to the pattern 29e near the pattern 29e but is slightly lower than the pattern 29e at a given distance from the pattern 29e, between which a smooth slope connects.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 82, on the insulation layer 11, formed are the underlying layer for vertical bias layer 2a and the vertical bias layer 2b. The vertical bias layer 2b is varied in thickness along the slope of the insulation layer 11, allowing the vertical bias layer 2b to be thick in thickness at a given distance from the pattern 29e and reduced in thickness with increasing proximity to the pattern 29e.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 83, the photoresist 20 is removed to form the first magnetic layer 8b and a fourth magnetic layer 18 on the second non-magnetic layer 9 and the vertical bias layer 2b.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 84, a second free layer 19, a fifth non-magnetic layer 25, a second fixed layer 26, a second fixing layer 27, and the upper layer 7 are formed in that order.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 85, the photoresist 21 is formed to cover the region that matches the pattern 29e on the upper layer 7. With the photoresist 21 being employed as a mask, the fourth non-magnetic layer 18, the second free layer 19, the fifth non-magnetic layer 20, the second fixed layer 26, the second fixing layer 27, and the upper layer 7 are patterned. Formed thereby is a pattern 29f made up of the fourth non-magnetic layer 18, the second free layer 19, the fifth non-magnetic layer 20, the second fixed layer 26, the second fixing layer 27, and the upper layer 7.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 86, around the pattern 29f, the insulation layer 11b is formed to bury pattern 29f therein, thereby providing a magneto-resistance effect element 39a formed on the lower shield layer 16.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 87, the photoresist 21 is removed, and the upper conductive layer 15 is deposited on the upper layer 7 and the insulation layer 11b to form a photoresist (not shown). With this photoresist being employed as a mask, the upper conductive layer 15 is patterned by dry etching or like means. Thereafter, the photoresist is removed and the upper shield layer 17 is formed thereupon, thus forming a magneto-resistance effect head 69a.",
        "Now, the structure of the magneto-resistance effect element 39a according to this embodiment is described below. As shown in FIG. 87, the magneto-resistance effect element 39a is adapted that the non-magnetic layer, the free layer, the non-magnetic layer, the fixed layer, and the fixing layer are formed to be vertically symmetric with respect to the second non-magnetic layer 8b to which a vertical bias magnetic field is applied from the underlying layer for vertical bias layer 2a.",
        "The magneto-resistance effect element 39a is provided with the lower shield layer 16, and the lower conductive layer 1 is provided on the lower shield layer 16. On top of the lower conductive layer 1, formed is the pattern 29e made up of the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a, the fixing layer 6b, the fixed layer 5, the first non-magnetic layer 4, the free layer 3b, and the second non-magnetic layer 9, which have been patterned. The pattern 29e is buried in the insulation layer 11.",
        "The upper surface of the insulation layer 11 is generally flush with that of the pattern 29e near the pattern 29e but is slightly lower than the upper surface of the pattern 29e at a given distance from the pattern 29e. The pattern of the underlying layer for vertical bias layer 2a and the vertical bias layer 2b is provided to allow at least part thereof in the direction of film thickness to be buried in the insulation layer 11. The second non-magnetic layer 9 is provided on the pattern 29e and the vertical bias layer 2b.",
        "On top of the second non-magnetic layer 9, the pattern 29f is provided which is made up of the fourth magnetic layer 18, the second free layer 19, the fifth non-magnetic layer 25, the second fixed layer 26, the second fixing layer 27, and the upper layer 7, which have been patterned, with the pattern 29f being buried in the insulation layer 11b. In addition, the upper conductive layer 15 and the upper shield layer 17 are provided on the pattern 29f and the insulation layer 11b.",
        "Now, the operation of the magneto-resistance effect element 39a according to this embodiment is described below. When a sensor containing the magneto-resistance effect element 39a is subjected to an external magnetic field, the second free layer 19, like the free layer 3b, serves as a magnetic layer which changes its orientation of magnetization in accordance with the orientation and magnitude of the magnetic field. The fifth non-magnetic layer 25 is disposed between the second free layer 19 and the second fixed layer 26, and varies in electrical resistance in accordance with the angle between the orientation of magnetization of the second free layer and that of the second fixed layer 26. The orientation of magnetization of the second fixed layer 26 is pinned by the second fixing layer 27. Thus, a change in orientation of magnetization of the free layer in accordance with the orientation and magnitude of an external magnetic field would cause a change to occur between the orientation of magnetization of the fixed layer, the orientation of which is pinned, and that of the free layer. This results in a change in resistance of the fifth non-magnetic layer 25.",
        "In the magneto-resistance effect element 39a, the amount of a change in electrical resistance produced upon conducting a sense current from the lower conductive layer 1 to the upper conductive layer 15 is equal to the sum of a change in electrical resistance of the pattern 29e located below the magnetic layer 8 and a change in electrical resistance of the pattern 29f located above the magnetic layer 8.",
        "Generally, in the magneto-resistance effect element, the free layer is unavoidably subjected to the influence of a circular electric magnetic field caused by a current flowing perpendicularly to the film surface. However, in the magneto-resistance effect element 39a according to this embodiment, the influence of the electric magnetic field to which the free layer 3b is subjected is opposite to that of the electric magnetic field to which the second free layer 19 is subjected, thereby canceling out the influences as a whole. Thus, it is made possible to significantly reduce the influence of the electric magnetic field.",
        "In addition, in the magneto-resistance effect element 39a, the vertical bias magnetic field applied is first applied to the second magnetic layer 8 via the vertical bias layer 2b. Then, the vertical bias magnetic field is applied to the free layer 3b from the second magnetic layer 8 via the second non-magnetic layer 9 and to the second free layer 19 through the fourth non-magnetic layer 18. The second non-magnetic layer 9 controls the magnetic coupling between the second magnetic layer 8b and the free layer 3b by the component material and film thickness thereof, while the fourth non-magnetic layer 18 controls the magnetic coupling between the magnetic layer 8b and the second free layer 19 by the component material and film thickness thereof. As described above, a vertical bias magnetic field is applied to the free layer 3b and the second free layer 19 from the vertical bias layer 2b through two steps of process, thereby assuring the application of the vertical bias magnetic field and facilitating the control of the amount of application of the magnetic field.",
        "Incidentally, in this embodiment, the underlying layer for vertical bias layer 2a, the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a, the second non-magnetic layer 9, the fourth magnetic layer 18, and the upper layer 7 can be omitted. Furthermore, in some cases, a protective layer for protecting the vertical bias layer may be provided on the vertical bias layer 2b.",
        "In addition, in this embodiment, it has been explained in which the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a, the fixing layer 6b, the fixed layer 5, the first non-magnetic layer 4, the free layer 3b, and the second non-magnetic layer 9 are patterned in the same way. However, it is necessary to pattern at least the free layer 3b but not necessary to pattern the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a, the fixing layer 6b, the fixed layer 5, and the first non-magnetic layer 4. Furthermore, the pattern of the underlying layer for fixing layer 6a may be extended further than that of the fixing layer 6b. The pattern of the fixing layer 6b may be extended further than that of the fixed layer 5. The pattern of the fixed layer 5 may be extended further than that of the non-magnetic layer 4. The pattern of the first non-magnetic layer 4 may be extended further than that of the free layer 3b.",
        "Still furthermore, this embodiment has shown that the upper surface of the insulation layer 11 is lower than that of the pattern of the free layer 3b at a given distance from the pattern 29e or 29f. However, the upper surface of the insulation layer 11 may be equal in height to the upper surface of the pattern of the free layer 3b or higher than the upper surface of the pattern of the free layer 3b. Furthermore, the pattern of the vertical bias layer 2b may be spaced apart from the pattern of the free layer 3b and that of the second free layer 19. In addition, the fourth magnetic layer 18 may be patterned in conjunction with the second free layer 19 and extended further than the pattern of the second free layer 19. Furthermore, the pattern of the second non-magnetic layer 9 may be extended further than that of the free layer 3b.",

        "The structure of FIG. 1 provides a read output as high as 2.8 to 3.1 mV but S/N ratio as low as 18 to 21 dB. This was caused by Barkhausen noise included in the read signal. It was found by measuring the R-H loop of the head that the hysteresis produced by the inversion of the free layer magnetization was so high as to cause the Barkhausen noise involved in the magnetic wall displacement of the free layer. In the structure of FIG. 1, it is considered that since the vertical bias layer and the free layer are isolated by the insulation layer, the vertical bias magnetic field is not applied sufficiently to the free layer, so that the vertical bias magnetic field does not contribute to the reduction in Barkhausen noise.",
        "On the other hand, in the structure of FIG. 2, the read output was as low as 0 to 1.2 mV, and accordingly the (S/N) ratio was as low as 0 to 17 dB. This is because the sense current leaks out to the vertical bias layer 2b and thus does not conduct through the non-magnetic layer 4. In this structure, it may be possible in principle to prevent the leakage of the sense current to the vertical bias layer 2b; however, the leakage cannot be prevented. This is conceivably because the structure cannot be precisely fabricated to prevent the leakage of the sense current to the vertical bias layer 2b and conduct the sense current sufficiently through the non-magnetic layer 4. This results from the fact that the vertical bias layer 2b is in close proximity to the end portion of the non-magnetic layer 4 (barrier layer) in the layered body made up of the fixed layer 5, the non-magnetic layer 4, and the free layer 3.",

        "It can be seen that any one of the structures shown in FIGS. 10, 21, 31, 37, 49 and 64 provides a S/N ratio of 25 dB or more, thus providing a significantly improved S/N ratio in comparison with the prior-art example. This is because any one of the structures can prevent the sense current from bypassing the barrier layer, and therefore provide sufficient output and successfully apply a proper amount of vertical bias magnetic field to the free layer, thereby making it possible to sufficiently reduce noise and thus provide a good S/N ratio. Among the magneto-resistance effect heads shown in FIGS. 10, 21, 31, 37, 49, and 64, the one shown in FIG. 64 has the smallest effective track width and provides the best result. This is conceivably because the magneto-resistance effect head shown in FIG. 64 has a layered anti-ferromagnetic layer structure of the magnetic layer 8, the third non-magnetic layer 13, and the second magnetic layer 12. This structure is thereby prevented from being subjected to the effect of the leakage magnetic field from the medium, so that the read effective track width is determined only by the width of the free layer 3b."
