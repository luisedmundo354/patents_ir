        "This invention is generally in the field of manufacturing of multi-layer structures, such as semiconductor wafers, ICs, and non-EUV and EUV masks and relates to measuring pattern overlay alignment accuracy, measuring location of alignment marks, detecting defects on wafers and masks, and measuring CDs of pattern features through the use of displacement interferometric metrology systems and interferometric imaging metrology systems operating in the IR to VUV and EUV and the use of measured properties of electromagnetic fields in the IR to VUV and EUV that are reflected/scattered by measurement objects comprising unpatterned and patterned wafers and masks augmented with results of inversion analyses based on rigorous treatment of electromagnetic fields reflected/scattered by the measurement objects.",
        "Aerial imaging overlay technology has been a reassuringly familiar feature of semiconductor manufacturing for years, experiencing little change. The wafers are loaded, special box-in-box (BiB) structures or targets are examined using a white-light microscope, and the images are then processed to determine overlay error. Although this has worked well, there are several issues as the industry moves toward implementing deep nanometer process levels with for example image overlay tools, location of alignment marks used in a stage metrology system of lithography tool or inspection tool, and measurement of properties such as CDs.",
        "With respect to overlay metrology, one of these issues has to do with the traditionally used BiB structures which tend to have large geometries and typically consist of bars microns in size that do not correspond to circuit feature sizes. Additionally, the BiB structures tend to have large areas of low feature density which polish at different rates than circuit areas with high feature density. As increasingly smaller features are being produced, it has become apparent that the behavior of these traditional BiB targets does not accurately reflect that of the circuit features themselves.",
        "This imaging overlay uncertainty has been tolerable because process windows have not had to be too tight and the available precision and accuracy have been adequate. Now, smaller geometries are resulting in accuracy issues that must be addressed in imaging overlay tools, in particular the tool-induced shift (TIS). For imaging overlay tools, TIS can be on the order of several nanometers. At the 65 nm node, 2 or 3 nm of TIS is a significant measurement uncertainty.",
        "Imaging overlay makes it difficult to reduce TIS because it is critically dependent upon residual aberrations in the imaging overlay optics with the most critical one being the microscope objective. Strehl ratios as high as 0.9 often do not provide the TIS performance required for advanced design rules. Thus, the technology faces not only optical problems but the fact that traditional overlay marks do not represent the actual behavior of circuit features that are orders of magnitude smaller.",
        "Overlay metrology is the art of checking the quality of alignment after lithography. Overlay error is defined as the offset between two patterned layers from their ideal relative position. An overlay error is a vector quantity with two components in the plane of the wafer. Depending on the context, overlay error may signify one of the components or the magnitude of the vector.",
        "Overlay metrology saves subsequent process steps that would be built on a faulty foundation in case of an alignment error. Overlay metrology provides the information that is necessary to correct the alignment of the stepper-scanner and thereby minimize overlay error on subsequent wafers. Moreover, overlay errors detected on a given wafer after exposing and developing the photoresist can be corrected by removing the photoresist and repeating the lithography step on a corrected stepper-scanner. If the measured error is minor, parameters for subsequent steps of the lithography process could be adjusted based on the output of the overlay metrology to avoid excursions. If overlay error is measured subsequently, e.g. after the etch step that typically follows the develop step, it can be used to \u201cscrap\u201d severely mis-processed wafers, or to adjust process equipment for better performance on subsequent wafers, i.e. APC.",
        "As the CD in IC device reduces, the total overlay budget needs to be more stringent. Typically, the allowable overlay error is \u2153 of the CD in the IC device. In this case, robustness of alignment mark is critical as accurate signal is required by the scanner's alignment system to precisely align a pattern of a layer to the pattern of the previous layer. Alignment issue is more severe in a back-end process partly due to the influence of CMP, which contributes to the asymmetric or total destruction of the alignment marks. The corresponding error in overlay accuracy has been called wafer induced shift (WIS).",
        "Alignment marks and patterns used in overlay metrology can be placed on/in the scribe-line between die sites on a wafer in order not to waste the usable area on the wafer. Dimensions of a standard scribe-line are 80 microns. Preferably, the alignment marks and the patterns should be as small as possible so as to create the option of reducing the size of scribe-lines and subsequently lead to an increase in the usable area on the wafer.",
        "However, reduced physical size of alignment marks and of overlay patterns used in overlay metrology reduces the magnitude of the diffracted signals detected in determination of alignment marks and overlay errors, respectively. Thus it is desirable to have an alignment mark metrology system and an overlay metrology system that meet the overlay accuracy requirements, have reduced TIS, can compensate for WIS, and reduces the area required for the alignment marks and the overlay patterns.",
        "The problems that arise in an optical measurement of a CD can also include those introduced by TIS and WIS. Thus an overlay metrology system and an alignment mark metrology system that successfully address the affects of TIS and WIS for a given technology node can be adapted for use in an improved CD metrology system.",
        "Defects of different types can affect the performance of overlay, alignment mark, and CD metrology systems. Accordingly, it is desirable for the respective metrology systems to be able to detect the presence of defects and take appropriate measures when the presence of a defect is detected.",
        "Prior overlay metrology methods use built-in test patterns etched or otherwise formed into or on the various layers during the same set of lithography steps that form the patterns for circuit elements on the wafer. The typical BiB pattern consists of two concentric squares, formed on a lower and an upper layer, respectively. \u201cBar-in-bar\u201d is a similar pattern with just the edges of the \u201cboxes\u201d demarcated, and broken into disjoint line segments. Typically one is the upper pattern and the other is the lower pattern, i.e. corresponding to earlier and later steps in the process. There are other patterns used for overlay metrology. The squares or bars are formed by lithographic and other processes used to make planar structures, e.g., CMP. Currently, the patterns for the boxes or bars are stored on lithography masks and projected onto the wafer. Other methods for putting the patterns on the wafer are possible, e.g. direct electron beam writing from computer memory, etc.",
        "In one form of the prior art, a high performance microscope imaging system combined with image processing software estimates overlay error for the two layers. The image processing software uses the intensity of light at a multitude of pixels. Obtaining the overlay error accurately requires a high quality imaging system and means of focusing it. Some of this prior art is reviewed by the article \u201cSemiconductor Pattern Overlay\u201d, by Neal T. Sullivan, Handbook of Critical Dimension Metrology and Process Control, Kevin M.

        "One requirement for the optical system is very stable positioning of the optical system with respect to the sample. Relative vibration would blur the image and degrade the performance. This is a difficult requirement to meet for overlay metrology systems that are integrated into a process tool. The tool causes potentially large accelerations (vibrations), e.g. due to high acceleration wafer handlers. The tight space requirements for integration preclude bulky isolation strategies.",
        "The imaging based overlay measurement precision can be two orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength of the light used to image the target patterns of concentric boxes or bars. At such small length scales, the image does not have well determined edges because of diffraction. The determination of the edge, and therefore the overlay measurement, is affected by any factor that changes the diffraction pattern. CMP is a commonly used technique to planarize the wafer surface at intermediate process steps before depositing more material. CMP can render the profile of the trenches or lines that make up the overlay measurement targets asymmetric. The asymmetry in target changes the diffraction pattern, thus potentially causing an overlay measurement error.",
        "In U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,207, Chappelow, et al. teach obtaining the quantitative value of the overlay offset from the reflectance of targets that consists of identical line gratings that are overlaid upon each other on a planar substrate. Chappelow et al. approximate the reflectance of the overlapping gratings as the average of the reflectances of four film stacks weighted by their area-fractions. This approximation, which neglects diffraction, has some validity when the lines and spaces are larger than largest wavelength of the reflectometer. The reflectance of each of the four film stacks is measured at a so called macro-site close to the overlay target. Each macro-site has a uniform film stack over a region that is larger than the measurement spot of the reflectometer. A limitation of U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,207 is that spatial variations in the film thickness that are caused by CMP and resist loss during lithography will cause erroneous overlay measurements.",
        "Another limitation of U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,207 is that reflectance is measured at eight sites in one overlay metrology target, which increases the size of the target and decreases the throughput of the measurement. Another limitation of U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,207 is that the lines and spaces need to be large compared to the wavelength, but small compared to the measurement spot which limits the accuracy and precision of the measurement.",
        "Another limitation of U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,207 is that the light intensity is measured by a single photodiode. The dependence of the optical properties of the sample is not measured as a function of wavelength, or angle of incidence, or polarization, which limits the precision of the measurement.",
        "The \u201caverage reflectivity\u201d approximation for the interaction of light with gratings, as employed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,207, greatly simplifies the problem of light interaction with a grating but neglects much of the diffraction physics. The model used to interpret the data has four distinct regions whose respective reflectivities are determined by the combination of layers formed by the substrate and the overlaid patterns and by the respective materials in the substrate and patterns. Eq. (1) in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,207 clearly indicates that these regions do not interact, i.e. via diffraction, as the total reflectivity of the structure is a simple average of the four reflectivities with area weighting.",

There are four sets of overlapping gratings to measure the x-offset and another four sets of overlapping gratings to measure the y-offset. The four sets of gratings, which are measured by a spectroscopic reflectometer, have offset biases of 0, \u00bc, \u00bd, \u00be-pitch. GE880210 does not use a model that accounts for the diffraction of light by the gratings or the multiple scattering of the light by the two gratings, and it has no provision to handle non-rectangular line profiles.",

The Moire pattern is formed by overlapping gratings patterns, one grating on the lower level, another on the upper level. The two grating patterns have different pitches. The Moire pattern approach requires imaging the overlapping gratings and estimating their offset from the spatial characteristics of the image.",

Nos. 6,023,338 and 6,079,256, Bareket teaches an alternative approach in which two complementary periodic grating structures are produced on the two subsequent layers that require alignment. The two periodic structures are arranged adjacent to and in fixed positions relative to one another, such that there is no overlap of the two structures. The two gratings are scanned, either optically or with a stylus, so as to detect the individual undulations of the gratings as a function of position. The overlay error is obtained from the spatial phase shift between the undulations of the two gratings.",
        "Smith et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,200,395 and Ono in U.S. Pat. No. 4,332,473 teach aligning a wafer and a mask by using overlapping diffraction gratings and measuring higher order, i.e. non-specular, diffracted light. One diffraction grating is on the wafer and another one is on the mask. The overlapping gratings are illuminated by a normally incident light and the intensities of the positive and negative diffracted orders, e. g. 1st and \u22121st orders, are compared. The difference between the intensities of the 1st and \u22121st diffracted orders provides a feedback signal which can be used to align the wafer and the mask. These inventions are similar to the International (PCT) Application Publication No. WO 02/065545 A2 in that they use overlapping gratings on two layers. However, the U.S. Pat. No. 4,200,395 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,332,473 patents are applicable to mask alignment but not to overlay metrology. They do not teach how to obtain the quantitative value of the offset from the light intensity measurements. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,200,395 and 4,332,473 are not applicable to a measurement system that only uses specular, i.e. zeroth-order diffracted light.",
        "WO 02/065545 A2 teaches measuring overlay by scatterometry. Measurements of structural parameters of a diffracting structure from optical characterization are now well known in the art as scatterometry. With such methods, a measurement sample is illuminated with optical radiation, and the sample properties are determined by measuring characteristics of the scattered radiation (e.g. intensity, polarization state, or angular distribution). A diffracting structure consists of one or more layers that may have lateral structure within the illuminated and detected area, resulting in diffraction of the reflected (or transmitted) radiation. If the lateral structure dimensions are smaller than the illuminating wavelengths, then diffracted orders other than the zeroth order may all be evanescent and not directly observable. But the structure geometry can nevertheless significantly affect the zeroth-order reflection, making it possible to make optical measurements of structural features much smaller than the illuminating wavelengths.",
        "In one type of measurement process of WO 02/065545 A2, a microstructure is illuminated and the intensity of reflected or diffracted radiation is detected as a function of the radiation's wavelength, the incidence direction, the collection direction, or polarization state (or a combination of such factors). Direction is typically specified as a polar angle and azimuth, where the reference for the polar angle is the normal to the wafer and the reference for the azimuth is either some pattern(s) on the wafer or other marker, e.g. a notch or a flat for silicon wafers. The measured intensity data is then passed to a data processing machine that uses some model of the scattering from possible structures on the wafer. For example, the model may employ Maxwell's equations to calculate the theoretical optical characteristics as a function of measurement parameters (e.g. film thickness, line width, etc.), and the parameters are adjusted until the measured and theoretical intensities agree within specified convergence criteria. The initial parameter estimates may be provided in terms of an initial \u201cseed\u201d model of the measured structure. Alternatively, the optical model may exist as pre-computed theoretical characteristics as a function of one or more measurement parameters in tabular form, i.e. a \u201clibrary\u201d, that associates collections of parameters with theoretical optical characteristics. The \u201cextracted\u201d structural model has the structural parameters associated with the optical model which best fits the measured characteristics, e.g. in a least-squares sense.",
        "Conrad (U.S. Pat. No. 5,963,329) uses scatterometry to measure the line profile or topographical cross-sections. The direct application of Maxwell's equations to diffracting structures, in contrast to non-diffracting structures (e.g. unpatterned films), is much more complex and time-consuming, possibly resulting in either a considerable time delay between data acquisition and result reporting and/or the need to use a physical model of the profile which is very simple and possibly neglects significant features.",
        "Scheiner et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,100,985) teaches a measurement method that is similar to that of Conrad, except that Scheiner's method uses a simplified, approximate optical model of the diffracting structure that does not involve direct numerical solution of Maxwell's equations. This avoids the complexity and calculation time of the direct numerical solution. However, the approximations inherent in the simplified model make it inadequate for grating structures that have period and line width dimensions comparable to or smaller than the illumination wavelengths.",
        "In an alternative method taught by McNeil et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,867,276) the calculation time delay is substantially reduced by storing a multivariate statistical analysis model based on calibration data from a range of model structures. The calibration data may come from the application of Maxwell's equations to parameterized models of the structure. The statistical analysis is applied to the measured diffraction characteristics and returns estimates of the parameters for the actual structure.",

The presence of defects may introduce errors in the measurements made by the displacement interferometric metrology system wherein the defects may be for example in the form of either an error in the profile of an associated surface and/or an error in the form of a particle. After the measurements used in determining the errors in an overlay, the location of an alignment mark, the error in a CD, or an error in another property are obtained, an interferometric microscopy system, e.g. differential interferometric microscopy system, may be used in an end use application to determine if there are defects present whose affects must be accounted for. The sensitivities of the results of the scan by the displacement interferometric metrology system and the subsequent measurements to determine the forms of errors are different with respect to each other. As a consequence, the results of the scan by the displacement interferometric metrology system and the subsequent measurements can be inverted if required and the nature with respect to form of each error determined. The differential interferometric microscopy systems may comprise either an interferometric confocal or interferometric non-confocal microscopy system.",

This property is used to advantage by specifying the pupil of the imaging system to be rectangular in cross-section with the boundaries of the rectangle aligned with the boundaries of the elements and selecting the aspect ratio of the rectangle to optimize performance of the linear displacement interferometric metrology system.",
        "The use of a pupil that is rectangular in cross-section makes it possible to decouple the properties of the measured conjugated quadratures of the fields reflected/scattered by the elements with respect to the \u03be and \u03b7 coordinates. As a consequence, it is simpler to optimize a design of an imaging system in the linear displacement interferometric metrology system and makes it possible to achieve a better performance with respect to signal-to-noise ratios.",

        "Two procedures may be used to measure the backscattered component generated. One procedure is to restrict the range of values in \u03be in Eq. (1) to eliminate both the forward reflected/scattered component and to either limit the contribution to the measured conjugated quadrature to a single diffraction order from the arrays of elements comprising more than one element or in the case of an array comprising a single element, to prevent the generation of undesired contributions to the reflected/scattered component by multiple reflections between widely separated elements.",
        "Another procedure is to not eliminate the contribution of forward reflected/scattered component in the measured conjugated quadratures but to restrict the range of values in \u03be in Eq. (1) to either limit the contribution to the measured conjugated quadrature to a single diffraction order from the arrays of elements comprising more than one element or in the case of an array comprising a single element, to prevent the generation of undesired contributions to the reflected/scattered component by multiple reflections between widely separated elements. The contributions of the forwarded/scattered components and the backscattered component are separated in the another procedure by the use of a form of phase sensitive detection such as described in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/816,172 (ZI-51) wherein both are entitled \u201cApparatus and Method for Measurement of Fields of Forward Scattered/Reflected and Backscattered Beams by an Object in Interferometry\u201d and both of which are by Henry A.

        "The properties of the measurement and reference beams are described in the context of specific embodiments of the present invention. However, it is appropriate to describe here a general property of at least some embodiments of the present invention that is achieved through the design of the reference beams used in the linear displacement interferometric metrology systems. The general property is that the reference beam is generated with properties such that the phase \u03a6 of conjugated quadratures corresponding to the interference cross-term in the electrical interference signal values between the reference beam and the reflected/scattered measurement beam from a given Porro type prism element or feature generated by detection of mixed output beams of the linear displacement interferometric metrology systems has no dependence on either x or y.",
        "The point spread function represented by Eq. (12) for the imaging system can be used to derive the image plane dependence of the phase \u03a6 of a spot being imaged by the interferometric imaging system. For apertures 62 of pinhole array 12 that are less than or of the order of the size of the resolution of the imaging system 100, the image plane dependent contribution \u03a6(x,y) to phase \u03a6 is determined to a good approximation as the image plane dependent contribution to the phase of U(P) given by Eq. (12) minus the corresponding phase of the reference beam. The result is expressed as",

        "This is an important feature since the phase represented in conjugated quadratures is a function only of the reflecting properties and location of the Porro type prism element or feature in addition to a fixed offset error in the linear displacement interferometric metrology systems. A corollary statement is that the accuracy to which the location of a surface of an open or filled transparent feature can be measured is not affected by displacements of a pinhole corresponding to a detector or of a detector pixel used in measuring the respective conjugated quadratures.",
        "The spots on the wafer that are being examined may contain a single pattern element or an array of two or more pattern elements in the form for example of a grating. It is beneficial to further describe the application of aspects of the present invention to the two cases from a pedagogical perspective and because the respective processing of measured conjugated quadratures can be formally different in certain aspects.",
        "Location of an Alignment Mark: Single Element Type",
        "The measurement of an error in an overlay, a location of an alignment mark, or an error in a CD in a spot comprising a single pattern feature is based in part on a linear displacement interferometric measurement wherein the measurement and/or the reference object comprises a Porro type prism element such as described in commonly owned U.S. Provisional patent applications Ser. No. 60/568,774 (ZI-60), Ser. No. 60/569,807 (ZI-61), and Ser. No. 60/573,196 (ZI-63) and the corresponding U.S. patent application (T.B.D.) (ZI-63) filed May 6, 2005 wherein all four are entitled \u201cApparatus And Methods For Measurement Of Critical Dimensions Of Features And Detection Of Defects In UV, VUV, And EUV Lithography Masks\u201d and each are by Henry A. Hill. The contents of each of the four cited applications are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference. The Porro type prism element or a measurement and/or reference object is formed by two partially reflecting surfaces of an open or filled transparent feature in the mask or wafer which may be contiguous or spatially separated. The two partially reflecting surfaces of the Porro type prism element are nominally orthogonal with respect to each other but may be at some other angle in a given end use application, e.g. 60 degrees or 80 degrees, without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.",
        "An example of the measurement and/or reference object comprising the Porro type prism element is shown diagrammatically as element 510 in FIG. 4a. Element 510 comprises two surfaces, a partially reflecting horizontal surface 520 forms one of the two reflecting surfaces and one of the partially reflecting nominally vertical surfaces of a feature in a mask 530 forms the second of the two reflecting surfaces. The feature comprises surface elements 520, 530, and 540.",
        "A defect in the reflecting substrate 520 in the form of a foreign particle will introduce an error in inferred position of the measurement object in addition to the error introduced by an error in either the profile of surface 520 and/or in a respective CD associated with surfaces 530 and 540. Thus a detected error in the relative locations of respective surfaces of a feature forming a Porro type prism element may be due to either an error in the physical location one or both of the respective feature surfaces and/or due to the presence of a defect, e.g. a particle or an error in the height profile of a surface, within the feature. Accordingly, it is necessary to examine the feature with a different diagnostic tool in order to isolate the contribution of an error in a CD to the linear displacement measurement, i.e. if there is detected an error in the apparent location of a Porro type prism element or measurement object formed by boundaries of an open or filled transparent feature, a check may be required to eliminate the possibility that a defect exists in the horizontal surface profile or in the form of a particle in the interior of the feature that may be generating the detected error in part or in whole.",
        "The different diagnostic tool comprises a differential interferometric confocal and/or an interferometric non-confocal microscopy system preferentially operating in a dark field mode. The differential interferometric microscopy systems may in addition be used to detect defects in any one of the reflecting surfaces of a mask, i.e. a reflecting substrate, the surface of a buffer, the surface of a phase-shifting layer, and/or the surface of an absorber at different points in the fabrication of the mask.",
        "A CD corresponding to the spacing between two opposing walls of an open or filled transparent feature are measured when using the linear displacement interferometric metrology systems by comparing the respective locations of the respective Porro type prism elements formed by the horizontal and vertical surfaces of the open or filled transparent feature. Thus the measurement of the CD is a differential technique. As a consequence, the value of the measured CD is independent of the refractive indices of the media forming the surfaces of the open or filled transparent feature.",
        "The pitch of a parallel array of elongated features corresponding to the spacing of corresponding walls of two contiguous open or filled transparent features are measured using the linear displacement interferometric metrology systems by comparing the respective locations of the respective Porro type prism elements formed by the horizontal and vertical surfaces of the open or filled transparent features of the array of elongated features. Thus the measurement of the pitch is a differential technique. As a consequence, the value of the measured pitch is independent of the refractive indices of the media forming the surfaces of the open or filled transparent features when the open or filled transparent features are identical or substantially the same with respect to composition.",
        "The calibration of the pitch scale is based on the use of a reference or standard parallel array and/or on the use of a stage metrology system. The accuracy of a pitch measurement will depend in part on the accuracy to which the surface profile of the array of horizontal reflecting surfaces of the open or filled transparent features are measured or known. The profile can be measured.",
        "Multiple Element Pattern: Grating Response",
        "The point spread function represented by Eq. (12) for the imaging system of a spot can be used to derive the dependence of the phase \u03a6m of a measured conjugated quadratures or differential conjugated quadratures on the translation of a grating pattern through the spot being imaged by the interferometric imaging system. Including the effects of the imaging system for delivering the measurement beam to the spot and with the conditions expressed by Eqs.

The values of \u03b8I and \u03b8D for the two different configurations of the interferometric imaging system of the alignment mark metrology system are equal in magnitude, respectively, but have opposite signs, respectively. The displacements in x0 are measured by the stage metrology system of the lithography tool for which information about the location of the alignment mark is being determined. It is assumed herein that the performance with respect to accuracy of the lithography stage metrology system matches the accuracy required to meet the accuracy of the overlay budget of the lithography tool/specific process.",
        "The location of the alignment mark is obtained as the average value of the two measured values of x0 if the spot contains a single scattering element and the average value of x0 mod \u039b if the spot contains a portion of a grating. The offset error in the case of the spot containing a single scattering element is calibrated by using a pair of Porro type prism elements on a calibration wafer separated by a distance larger than the size of the spot and the separation of the two Porro type prism elements measured by an independent procedure. The independent procedure may be based for example on measurements with a scanning Atomic Force Microscope (AFM).",
        "The removal of the redundancy with respect to \u039b is achieved by incorporating one or more additional gratings wherein the relative values of the pitches of the additional gratings form for example a geometric progression, i.e. 1,2,4,8, . . . , and the locations of each of the additional gratings are determined mod respective values of pitch. The number of additional gratings (N\u22121) required for each of two coordinate system axes will be determined by the ratio of the linear dimension of the spot to \u039b. Accordingly, N\u22673 based on the domain expressed in Eq. (21).",

For the example of \u03bb=200 nm and N=4, the area required for the alignment mark and additional gratings is approximately 0.05 (\u03bcm)2.",

The relative location of the two gratings corresponds to the measured spatial separation in x0 mod \u039b. The pitch redundancy generally will not present a problem when the measured separation mod \u039b is used in an overlay metrology system.

        "The relative location of non-superimposed gratings such as shown in FIG. 1i located on different process layers of a wafer is determined from measurements obtained by scanning the respective portions of wafer corresponding to two gratings and recording the spatial separation in x0 that corresponds to a change in \u03a6m mod 2\u03c0 for two different configurations of the respective metrology system. The values of \u03b8I and \u03b8D for the two different configurations of the interferometric imaging system of the metrology system are equal in magnitude, respectively, but have opposite signs, respectively. The displacements in x0 are measured by the stage metrology system of the lithography tool for which information about the location of the alignment mark is being determined. It is assumed herein that the performance with respect to accuracy of the lithography stage metrology system matches the accuracy required to meet the accuracy of the overlay budget of the lithography tool/specific process.",

The compensation uses the technique described in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/771,785 (ZI-44), entitled \u201cCompensation for Effects of Mismatch in Indices of Refraction at a Substrate-Medium Interface in Confocal and Interferometric Confocal Microscopy\u201d to Henry A.

        "There may be an offset error as a result of the affect of imaging of a spot interior of the wafer in each of the two scans of the wafer. However, the offset error will cancel out to a high level in computing the average of the two measured values of x0. The degree to which the offset errors cancel out can be checked by adapting the procedure described herein in the section entitled \u201cLocation of an Alignment Mark: Grating type\u201d for spots comprising a single scattering element. In this case, the independent procedure can be for example based on a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).",
        "A higher level of cancellation of the offset error can be achieved by using a set of an even number of gratings on one process layer and an odd number of gratings on the second process layer with the gratings on the two process layers interleaved transversely such as shown in FIG. 1i.",

With reference to FIG. 1j, the two superimposed gratings 740 and 742 are located in process layers 730 and 732, respectively. The inversion procedure is based on a rigorous treatment of scattering and iterating the assumed properties of the superimposed gratings until the computed other properties of the conjugated quadratures matches the measured other properties of the conjugated quadratures to a requisite level.",

        "Measurement of WIS",
        "The affect of WIS may be determined by measurement of phase shifts or from the analysis of properties of the differential conjugated quadratures based on a rigorous treatment of scattering and an iteration of the assumed properties of the features of patterns on a patterned wafer.",
        "The procedure based on the measurement of phases is the preferred procedure when there is a choice between the two procedures. The procedure based on measurement of phases generally is generally more accurate, less sensitive to assumed properties of a pattern, does not require extensive inversion analyses, and leads to a higher throughput.",
        "The procedure based on the measurement of phases is generally an option when the pattern under measurement is etched into a multilayer stack comprising two or more layers and the reflection properties of the different layers is different for s and p polarization states of measurement beams.",
        "The pitch \u039b of a portion of a grating, a CD of a pattern feature, or the spacing between two distinct gratings is measured using s and p polarization states of the measurement beam. The affect of WIS will be to introduce an asymmetry in the respective patterns by altering the top layer or layers of the multilayer stacks. Accordingly, the asymmetry will introduce a difference in the pitch \u039b of a portion of a grating, a CD of a pattern feature, or the spacing between two distinct gratings is measured using s and p polarization states of the measurement beam. Information about the affect of WIS can be determined from the measured difference by taking into account the different reflectivities of the layers with respect to state of polarization of the measurement beam. The most accurate information about the affect of WIS is obtained when the affect of WIS is confined to a single top layer.",
        "In the following description of the different embodiments, many elements of the different embodiments perform like functions and are indicated with the same numerals in different respective figures of the embodiments.",

If the properties of the two transversely separated sections are identical as the mask, patterned wafer, or unpatterned wafer is scanned, there will be no change in the measured conjugated quadratures. However, if at a certain location on the mask or patterned wafer, there is a difference in the two interferometrically compared sections, there will be a change in the measured conjugated quadratures.",
        "The difference in properties may be in the form of a surface profile, widths of the two sections, depths of the two sections, or a particle located on the surface or in one of the two sections. A difference in the two widths will generate a difference in the amplitudes of the beams scattered by the entrance plane aperture formed by the feature sections. A difference in the depths of the two sections or the presence of a particle located in one of the two sections will modify the properties of the leaky guided wave modes that are excited in the features by the respective measurement beams.

Detailed knowledge of the reflecting properties of two sections that are being compared interferometrically is required when the composition of the two sections are materially different. Because of the high level of modal structure of masks and patterned wafers, a detailed knowledge of the mask and patterned wafer structure is not required in the location of errors in CDs.",
        "A differential interferometric non-confocal is shown generally in FIG. 3. The description of FIG. 3 is the same as the description given for FIG. 1a except with respect to measurement beam 24A. In FIG. 3, measurement beam 24A is incident on measurement object 60 with an angle of incidence that is nominally zero. The primary difference between the information obtained about the open or filled transparent features using the confocal and non-confocal interferometric microscopy systems is with respect to the properties of the leaky guided wave modes that are excited.",
        "Information is obtained about the surface profile or the horizontal surface of an open or filled transparent feature or features with a reduced lateral spatial resolution and a reduced depth discrimination of the incident measurement beam for the non-confocal interferometric microscopy system. However, there is an advantage with the non-confocal interferometric microscopy system in that the amplitudes of the excited guided wave modes will generally be larger for the non-confocal interferometric microscopy system as compared to the corresponding confocal system. Another advantage for the non-confocal interferometric microscopy system is that the orders of the excited guided wave modes will generally comprise a smaller set as compared to the corresponding confocal system.",
        "Thus the information obtained about errors in surface profiles, CDs, depths, and the presence of defects in the form of particles from the confocal and the non-confocal interferometric microscopy systems are complimentary and will impact on the selection of one or the other of the confocal or non-confocal systems in an end use application.",
        "In another embodiment of the present invention, the confocal and non-confocal interferometric microscopy systems are combined in a single interferometric microscopy system. The another embodiment comprises the apparatus of the confocal interferometric microscopy system and a beam delivery system for the measurement beam that switches the measurement beam 24A between a slit-array 114 (see FIGS. 1f and 2c) and to object 60 with a nominal zero angle of incidence.",
        "Other embodiments of the present invention are described wherein joint measurements are obtained of the conjugated quadratures of fields of complimentary measurement beams reflected/scattered by defects of a measurement object. The complimentary measurement beams correspond to two measurement beams that have orthogonal states of linear polarization. The other embodiments comprise the apparatus of embodiments described in cited U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/816,180 (ZI-50) and the apparatus and procedures of the first embodiment described herein.",
        "In yet other embodiments of the present invention, the interferometric metrology systems may be configured to obtain information in the form of joint and non-joint measurements about the angular distribution of the reflected/scattered beams by defects in measurement objects. The yet other embodiments comprise the apparatus described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/938,408 (ZI-54) for the acquisition of information about angular distributions.",
        "Many of the embodiments of the present invention can be configured for operation in the transmission mode consistent with properties of the mask or wafer for which alignment mark, overlay, and/or CD information is required. The description of these embodiments is the same as the descriptions of interferometric metrology systems as described for example in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/948,959 (ZI-56).",
        "Interferometric Microscopy Systems: Near- and Evanescent-Field Probe Beams",
        "Other embodiments of the present invention may be configured to operate with measurement beams that have the properties of a near-field or an evanescent field at the wafer. Evanescent fields are generated by selecting the angle of incidence \u03b82 (see FIG. 2d) of the measurement beams at the plane surface of plano-convex lens 258 to be greater than that required to produce total internal reflection and the separation h\u2266\u03bb/4 such as described in cited U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/866,010 (ZI-52) and Ser. No. 10/948,959 (ZI-56). The angle of incidence may be selected by the relative locations of apertures used in a mask such as mask 114B of the third embodiment of the present invention.",
        "The non-oblique measurement beams at substrate 60 may be in the form of near-fields when an array of transmitting sub-wavelength apertures is located on the plane surface of plano-convex lens 258 and the separation h\u2266\u03bb/4 such as described in cited U.S. Pat. No. 6,445,453 (ZI-14).",
        "The information obtained with other embodiments of the present invention has for example the high sensitivities of an interferometric metrology system to vertical displacements of a surface and to asymmetries at a site on a wafer. The high sensitivities of interferometric metrology systems based on use of near- or evanescent-field measurement beams lead to high accuracies in overlay, alignment mark, CD metrology systems, and defect detection. The complexity of inversion procedures used in the overlay, alignment mark, and CD metrology systems based on a rigorous treatment of scattering is generally reduced because the patterns on the wafer under measurement need not be overlapping in order to obtain the desired information with required accuracy.",
        "The interferometric metrology systems described above can be especially useful in alignment mark identification on a stepper or scanner of lithography applications used for fabricating large scale integrated circuits such as computer chips and the like and in a stand-alone metrology system for measuring CD and overlay performance of the stepper or scanner. The interferometric metrology systems described above can also be especially useful in inspection of masks used in the stepper or scanner and in the inspection of wafers at different stages of the fabrication of large-scale integrated circuits.",
        "Lithography is the key technology driver for the semiconductor manufacturing industry. In particular, overlay improvement is one of the five most difficult challenges down to and below 100 nm line widths (design rules), see, for example, the Semiconductor Industry Roadmap, pp 82 (1997). Since a lithography tool may produce $50-100M/year of product, the economic value from improving (maintaining) performance of the lithography tool is substantial. Each 1% increase (loss) in yield of the lithography tool results in approximately $1M/year economic benefit (loss) to the integrated circuit manufacturer and a substantial competitive advantage or disadvantage to the lithography tool vendor.",
        "Overlay is measured by printing one pattern on one level of a wafer and a second pattern on a consecutive level of the wafer and then measuring, on a stand-alone metrology system, the difference in the position, orientation, and distortion of the two patterns.",
        "A stand-alone metrology system for measuring overlay comprises a microscope system for viewing the patterns, such as the catadioptric imaging systems described above, connected to laser gauge-controlled stage for measuring the relative positions of the patterns, and a wafer handling system.",
        "The function of a lithography tool is to direct spatially patterned radiation onto a photoresist-coated wafer. The process involves determining which location of the wafer is to receive the radiation (alignment) and applying the radiation to the photoresist at that location.",
        "To properly position the wafer, the wafer includes alignment marks on the wafer that can be measured by dedicated sensors such as the interferometric metrology systems described above. The measured positions of the alignment marks define the location of the wafer within the tool. This information, along with a specification of the desired patterning of the wafer surface, guides the alignment of the wafer relative to the spatially patterned radiation. Based on such information, a translatable stage supporting the photoresist-coated wafer moves the wafer such that the radiation will expose the correct location of the wafer.",
        "During exposure, a radiation source illuminates a patterned reticle, which scatters the radiation to produce the spatially patterned radiation. The reticle is also referred to as a mask, and these terms are used interchangeably below. In the case of reduction lithography, a reduction lens collects the scattered radiation and forms a reduced image of the reticle pattern. Alternatively, in the case of proximity printing, the scattered radiation propagates a small distance (typically on the order of microns) before contacting the wafer to produce a 1:1 image of the reticle pattern. The radiation initiates photo-chemical processes in the resist that convert the radiation pattern into a latent image within the resist.",
        "When a mask is made, it must be perfect. Any defects in the pattern will destroy the functionality of the semiconductor circuit that is printed with that mask. Before a mask is delivered to the semiconductor manufacturing line, it is passed through an automated mask inspection system that searches for any defects in the pattern. There are two possible strategies in mask inspection, known as die-to-database and die-to-die inspection. The first method involves an automated scanning microscope or an interferometric metrology system described herein that compares the mask pattern directly with the computer data used to generate the mask. This requires a very large data handling capability, similar to that needed by the mask writer itself. Any discrepancy between the inspected mask pattern and the data set used to create it is flagged as an error. The interferometric metrology systems described above are especially well suited for automated mask inspection with its advantages in background reduction and in the substantially simultaneous acquisition of one-dimensional line section images and two-dimensional section images.",
        "In general, the lithography system, also referred to as an exposure system, typically includes an illumination system and a wafer positioning system. The illumination system includes a radiation source for providing radiation such as ultraviolet, visible, x-ray, electron, or ion radiation, and a reticle or mask for imparting the pattern to the radiation, thereby generating the spatially patterned radiation. In addition, for the case of reduction lithography, the illumination system can include a lens assembly for imaging the spatially patterned radiation onto the wafer. The imaged radiation exposes resist coated onto the wafer. The illumination system also includes a mask stage for supporting the mask and a positioning system for adjusting the position of the mask stage relative to the radiation directed through the mask. The wafer positioning system includes a wafer stage for supporting the wafer and a positioning system for adjusting the position of the wafer stage relative to the imaged radiation. Fabrication of integrated circuits can include multiple exposing steps. For a general reference on lithography, see, for example, J. R. Sheats and B. W. Smith, in Microlithography: Science and Technology (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1998), the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "An example of a lithography scanner 800 using an interferometric metrology system 830 is shown in FIG. 7a. Interferometric metrology system 830 is used to precisely locate the position of alignment marks on the wafer (not shown) within an exposure system. Here, stage 822 is used to position and support the wafer relative to an exposure station. Scanner 800 includes a frame 802, which carries other support structures and various components carried on those structures. An exposure base 804 has mounted on top of it a lens housing 806 atop of which is mounted a reticle or mask stage 816, which is used to support a reticle or mask. A positioning system for positioning the mask relative to the exposure station is indicated schematically by element 817. Positioning system 817 can include, e.g. piezoelectric transducer elements and corresponding control electronics. Although, it is not included in this described embodiment, one or more interferometry systems are used to precisely measure the position of the mask stage as well as other moveable elements whose position must be accurately monitored in processes for fabricating lithographic structures (see supra Sheats and Smith Microlithography: Science and Technology).",

Stage 822 includes a plane mirror 828 for reflecting a measurement beam 854 directed to the stage by interferometry system 826. A positioning system for positioning stage 822 relative to interferometry system 826 is indicated schematically by element 819. Positioning system 819 can include, e.g. piezoelectric transducer elements and corresponding control electronics.

        "During operation, a radiation beam 810, e.g. an UV beam from a UV laser (not shown), passes through a beam shaping optics assembly 812 and travels downward after reflecting from mirror 814. Thereafter, the radiation beam passes through a mask (not shown) carried by mask stage 816. The mask (not shown) is imaged onto a wafer (not shown) on wafer stage 822 via a lens assembly 808 carried in a lens housing 806.

        "As is well known in the art, lithography is a critical part of manufacturing methods for making semiconductor devices. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,483,343 outlines steps for such manufacturing methods. These steps are described below with reference to FIGS. 7b and 7c. FIG. 7b is a flow chart of the sequence of manufacturing a semiconductor device such as a semiconductor chip (e.g. IC or LSI), a liquid crystal panel or a CCD. Step 851 is a design process for designing the circuit of a semiconductor device. Step 852 is a process for manufacturing a mask on the basis of the circuit pattern design. Step 853 is a process for manufacturing a wafer by using a material such as silicon.",
        "Step 854 is a wafer process, which is called a pre-process wherein, by using the so prepared mask and wafer, circuits are formed on the wafer through lithography. To form circuits on the wafer that correspond with sufficient spatial resolution those patterns on the mask, interferometric positioning of the lithography tool relative the wafer is necessary. The catadioptric imaging systems described herein can be especially useful to inspect the surface of the wafer and internal layers generate on the wafer by wafer processing to check and monitor the effectiveness of the lithography used in the wafer process. Step 855 is an assembling step, which is called a post-process wherein the wafer processed by step 854 is formed into semiconductor chips. This step includes assembling (dicing and bonding) and packaging (chip sealing). Step 856 is an inspection step wherein operability check, durability check and so on of the semiconductor devices produced by step 855 are carried out. With these processes, semiconductor devices are finished and they are shipped (step 857).",
        "FIG. 7c is a flow chart showing details of the wafer process. Step 861 is an oxidation process for oxidizing the surface of a wafer. Step 862 is a CVD process for forming an insulating film on the wafer surface. Step 863 is an electrode forming process for forming electrodes on the wafer by vapor deposition. Step 864 is an ion implanting process for implanting ions to the wafer. Step 865 is a resist process for applying a resist (photosensitive material) to the wafer. Step 866 is an exposure process for printing, by exposure (i.e., lithography), the circuit pattern of the mask on the wafer through the exposure apparatus described above. Once again, as described above, the use of the catadioptric imaging systems described herein improve the accuracy, resolution, and maintenance of such lithography steps.",
        "Step 867 is a developing process for developing the exposed wafer. Step 868 is an etching process for removing portions other than the developed resist image. Step 869 is a resist separation process for separating the resist material remaining on the wafer after being subjected to the etching process. By repeating these processes, circuit patterns are formed and superimposed on the wafer.",
        "An important application of the interferometric metrology systems described herein is the inspection of patterns on masks and reticles used in the lithography methods described previously, the measurement of CD's and overlay on wafers and the inspection of the masks, reticles, and wafers for defects. As an example, a schematic of a mask and wafer inspection system 900 is shown in FIG. 8. A source 910 generates a source beam 912 and an interferometric metrology system 914 such as described herein directs the radiation beam to a substrate 916 supported by a movable stage 918. To determine the relative position of the stage, an interferometry system 920 directs a reference beam 922 to a mirror 924 mounted on beam focusing assembly 914 and a measurement beam 926 to a mirror 928 mounted on stage 918. Changes in the position measured by the interferometry system correspond to changes in the relative position of write beam 912 on substrate 916. Interferometry system 920 sends a measurement signal 932 to controller 930 that is indicative of the relative position of inspection beam 912 on substrate 916. Controller 930 sends an output signal 934 to a base 936 that supports and positions stage 918.",
        "Controller 930 can cause interferometric metrology system assembly 914 to scan the inspection beam over a region of the substrate, e.g. using signal 944. As a result, controller 930 directs the other components of the system to inspect the substrate. The mask and wafer inspection measures overlay and compares the mask, reticle, or wafer pattern obtained with interferometric metrology system 914 directly with computer data used to generate the mask, reticle or the pattern on the wafer.",
