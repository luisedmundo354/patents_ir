    "abstract": "A viewfinder of a photographing apparatus to monitor a photographed image. The viewfinder of the photographing apparatus has a viewfinder body disposed to be drawn inside of the photographing apparatus body and outside of the photographing apparatus body, and a driving unit to drive the drawing-in and drawing-out of the viewfinder body. Moreover, when an outer LCD, which is disposed at an outer part of the photographing apparatus body, is rotated by a predetermined degree in a state that the viewfinder body is drawn outside of the photographing apparatus body, the viewfinder body is automatically drawn inside of the photographing apparatus body. On the other hand, when the outer LCD is rotated on a rotating axis on a plane of the outer LCD and faces an object, the viewfinder body is drawn out again to the outside of the photographing apparatus body. Therefore, the viewfinder of the photographing apparatus can be drawn in and drawn out of the photographing apparatus body in accordance with driving of the driving unit. Accordingly, the appearance of the camcorder becomes more appealing to the eye, and storing and handling of the product becomes easier.",

        "This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 01-35650 filed on Jun. 22, 2001, in the Korean Industrial Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a viewfinder of a photographing apparatus, and more particularly to a viewfinder of a photographing apparatus that allows a user to monitor a photographing image (or object) or a reproducing image when photographing an image or reproducing the photographed image using a photographing apparatus.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "A photographing apparatus is a device to photograph an image (or object, etc.). As an example of the photographing apparatus, there is an apparatus that can only photograph an image, such as a manual or an automatic camera, and an apparatus that can photograph and reproduce the image, such as a camcorder or a digital camera.",
        "A camcorder, (also referred to as a video camera, ) photographs an image and records it as image data on a videotape, and it is used generally to record and/or reproduce the image among many photographing apparatuses. Generally, the camcorder includes a viewfinder to monitor a photographing image or a reproducing image when a user photographs an image or reproduces the photographed image.",
        "FIG. 1 is a perspective view schematically illustrating the viewfinder of a conventional camcorder.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1, a conventional camcorder 10 includes a camcorder body 11 having a photographing unit to photograph the image and a recording unit to record the photographed image, and a view finder 12 formed on an outer part of the camcorder body 11 to allow the user to monitor the photographing or the reproducing image. The viewfinder 12 can be manually rotated 70\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 to an upper part of the camcorder body 11 as indicated by the arrow A in FIG. 1, and the viewfinder 12 protrudes from the camcorder body 11.",
        "However, since the viewfinder of a conventional camcorder with the above construction is mounted on the camcorder body in a protruding fashion, there is a problem in that handling and storing of the product is inconvenient. In addition, when the camcorder is designed, it is difficult to design the appearance of the camcorder as simple and appealing to the eye because the construction of the viewfinder must be considered. Moreover, operation of the camcorder is not simple since the user has to move the viewfinder manually.",
        "The present invention has been designed to overcome the above-mentioned and other problems of the related art.",
        "Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a viewfinder of a photographing apparatus that is easy to handle and store, and a camcorder having the same.",
        "It is another object of the present invention to provide a viewfinder of a photographing apparatus of simple and appealing design, and a camcorder having the same.",
        "It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a viewfinder of a photographing apparatus that has a simple operation of drawing-in and drawing-out with respect to the photographing apparatus or camcorder.",
        "Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.",
        "The foregoing and other objects of the present invention are achieved by providing a viewfinder of a photographing apparatus comprising a viewfinder body disposed to be drawn into a photographing apparatus body and to be drawn out of the photographing apparatus body, and a driving unit to drive the drawing-in and drawing-out of the viewfinder body.",
        "According to the present invention, when a user does not use the viewfinder, the viewfinder is drawn into the photographing apparatus body, thus allowing the appearance of the photographing apparatus to be very appealing to the eye. Further, the photographing apparatus of the present invention is easy to handle and store.",
        "On the other hand, the photographing apparatus according to the present invention includes a photographing apparatus body, a display rotatably disposed at an outside portion of the photographing apparatus body to be operated when the rotating range of the photographing apparatus body is more than a predetermined range, a viewfinder body disposed to be drawn into the photographing apparatus body and drawn out of the photographing apparatus body, a driving unit to drive the drawing-in and drawing-out of the viewfinder body, a controlling unit to control the driving unit to draw the viewfinder body inside of the photographing apparatus body when the display is operated, and draw the viewfinder body outside of the photographing apparatus body when the display is not operated.",
        "These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent and more readily appreciated from the following description of the embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings of which:",
        "FIG. 1 is a perspective view schematically illustrating a viewfinder of a conventional camcorder;",

The viewfinder body 30 is drawn into and drawn out of the camcorder body 110 along the guide 50 in accordance with the linear movement of the rack 68. The worm gear 64 reduces the rotating speed of the driving motor 62 and increases the rotating force of the pinion 66. Therefore, the viewfinder 120 is smoothly drawn into and drawn out of the camcorder body 110.",
        "Referring to FIG. 6, a controlling unit 70 is disposed at the camcorder body 110 and drives the driving motor 62 in accordance with a user's manipulation. In other words, when power is supplied to photograph and/or reproduce an image, the controlling unit 70 controls the driving unit 60 so that the viewfinder 120 can be drawn out of the camcorder body 110. On the other hand, when power of the camcorder 100 is off, the controlling unit 70 controls the driving unit 60 so that the viewfinder 120 can be drawn into the camcorder body 110. In addition, the controlling unit 70 controls the driving unit 60 so that the viewfinder body 30 can be drawn into and drawn out of the camcorder body 110 in accordance with a detecting signal of the rotating range detecting unit 72 and/or the rotating degree detecting unit 74. In other words, when the rotating range detecting unit 72 detects that the outer LCD 130 is rotated more than a predetermined degree with respect to the camcorder body 110, the controlling unit 70 controls the driving unit 60 so that the viewfinder body 30 is drawn into the camcorder body 110. On the other hand, when the rotating range detecting unit 72 detects that the outer LCD 130 is closed, or when a rotating degree detecting unit 74 detects that the outer LCD is rotated 180\u00b0 on a rotating axis X on the plane of the outer LCD 130, the controlling unit 70 controls the driving unit 60 so that the viewfinder body 30 is drawn out of the camcorder body 110.",
        "The display driving unit 86 drives the outer LCD 130 and/or the viewfinder LCD 22 to display a photographing image at the photographing unit 82 or a reproduced image at the reproducing unit 84 under the control of the controlling unit 70 at the outer LCD 130 and/or the viewfinder LCD 22.

The second switch SW2 is connected with the reproducing unit 84 and the outer LCD 130 and/or the viewfinder LCD 22 under the control of the controlling unit 70.",
        "General operation of the camcorder with the above construction will be described by referring to FIGS. 3 through 8.",
        "When the user wants to photograph an object while seeing an image of the object through the viewfinder 120 of the camcorder 100 shown in FIG. 2A, the controlling unit 70 drives the driving motor 62 in accordance with a controlling signal from the user. When the driving motor 62 is driven, the rack 68, engaged with the pinion 66, is moved in the drawing-out direction of the viewfinder 120 in accordance with the rotating of the worm gear 64. Since the rack 68 is moved, the viewfinder body 30 is drawn out of the housing 52 until the guide protrusion 56a of the plate spring 56 is separated from the second guide hole 54b and connected with the first guide hole 54a. As shown in FIG. 2B, if the viewfinder 120 is drawn out of the camcorder body 110, the controlling unit 70 supplies the image, photographed at the photographing unit 82, to the viewfinder LCD 22 by turning on the second switch SW2. At this time, the outer LCD 130 is closed, and the first switch SW1 is turned off.",
        "When the user wants to photograph the image while seeing the outer LCD 130 of the camcorder 100 instead of the viewfinder 120, the user rotatably opens the outer LCD 130. The rotating range detecting unit 72 detects the rotating degree of the outer LCD 130 and sends this information to the controlling unit 70. The controlling unit 70 draws in the viewfinder 120 into the camcorder body 110 by driving the driving motor 62 when the rotating degree, detected at the rotating range detecting unit 72, falls in a predetermined range that is more than 10\u00b0 and less than 20\u00b0. Further, the controlling unit 70 does not supply the image, photographed at the photographing unit 82, to the viewfinder LCD 22 by turning off the second switch SW2. Moreover, the controlling unit 70 displays the image signal photographed at the photographing unit 82 through the outer LCD 130 by turning on the first switch SW1.",
        "Similar to the above operation, if the user closes the outer LCD 130 of the camcorder 100 while photographing the image using the viewfinder 120, the rotating range detecting unit 72 detects the rotating degree of the outer LCD 130 and sends this information to the controlling unit 70. When the rotating degree detected at the rotating range detecting unit 72 is less than 100, the controlling unit 70 turns off the first switch SW1 and does not display the image photographed at the photographing unit 82 through the outer LCD 130. Instead, the controlling unit 70 draws the viewfinder 120 outside of the camcorder body 110 by driving the driving motor 62. When the driving motor 62 is driven in this case, the rack 68, engaged with the pinion 66, is moved in the drawing-out direction of the viewfinder 120 in accordance with the rotation of the worm gear 64. As the rack 68 moves, the viewfinder body 30 is drawn out from the housing 52 until the guide protrusion 56a of the plate spring 56 is separated from the second guide hole 54b and connected with the first guide hole 54a. As shown in FIG. 2B, when the viewfinder 120 is drawn out from the camcorder body 110, the controlling unit 70 drives the second switch SW2. As the second switch SW2 is driven, the image signal, photographed through the photographing unit 82, is displayed on the viewfinder LCD 22.",
        "Another example provides a case wherein the image being photographed is a person, wherein both the user that photographs the image using the camcorder 100 and the person that is being photographed want to see the photographing image. The person who photographs the image manipulates a drawing-out signal of the viewfinder 120 to the controlling unit 70. The controlling unit 70 drives the driving motor 62 in accordance with the drawing-out signal. When the driving motor 62 is driven, the rack 68, engaged with the pinion 66, is moved in the drawing-out direction of the viewfinder 120 in accordance with rotation of the worm gear 64. As the rack 68 moves, the viewfinder body 30 is drawn out of the housing 52 until the guide protrusion 56a of the plate spring 56 is separated from the second guide hole 54b and connected with the first guide hole 54a. As shown in FIG. 2B, if the viewfinder 120 is drawn out of the camcorder body 110, the controlling unit 70 supplies the image signal photographed through the photographing unit 82 to the viewfinder LCD 22 by turning on the second switch SW2. Then, the person doing the photographing opens the outer LCD 130 and makes the outer LCD 130 face the image being photographed by rotating the outer LCD 130 on a rotating axis X on the plane of the outer LCD 130. The rotating range detecting unit 72 detects the rotating degree of the outer LCD 130 and sends this information to the controlling unit 70. The controlling unit 70 turns on the first switch SW1 when the rotating degree detected at the rotating range detecting unit 72 is more than 170\u00b0 and less than 270\u00b0, and controls the outer LCD 130 to display the image photographed at the photographing unit 82 thereon. The user who photographs the image can see the photographed image through the viewfinder 120, and the person being photographed can see the photographed image through the outer LCD 130.",
        "In an embodiment of the present invention, the image being photographed through the photographing unit 82 has been illustrated and described, but the present invention is not limited to the embodiment. The present invention can be applied to a case wherein the image being recorded at a predetermined recording medium is reproduced through the reproducing unit 84. In table 7, the drawing-in and drawing-out of the viewfinder 120, as described above, in accordance with the outer LCD 130 is shown. In FIG. 8, it is illustrated whether the image signal is displayed or not at the outer LCD 130 and/or the viewfinder 120, in accordance with the on/off status of the first switch SW1 and the second switch SW2.",
        "According to the present invention, when the camcorder 100 is turned on or when the outer LCD 130 is closed, the viewfinder body 30 is automatically drawn out of the camcorder body 110. In the meantime, when the camcorder 100 is turned off or the outer LCD 130 attached at the camcorder 100 is opened, the viewfinder body 30 is drawn into the camcorder 100. Therefore, the operation of the viewfinder 120 is simple.",
        "Moreover, when the outer LCD 130 is rotated by, for example, 180\u00b0 on the rotating axis on the plane of the outer LCD 130, the viewfinder body 30 is drawn out of the camcorder body 110 with the above construction, and both the person who photographs and the image (or person) being photographed can view the photographed image. Note that the degree of rotation of the outer LCD 130 on the rotating axis on the plane of the outer LCD 130 may be set to any desired degree that provides the inventive feature as stated above.",
        "In addition, since the viewfinder 120 can be drawn into the camcorder body 110, handling and storing of the camcorder 100 becomes easier, and the appearance of the camcorder can be designed easier and more appealing to the eye.",
        "Although a few embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the appended claims and their equivalents."
