        "In response to an increasing threat of terrorism, inspection of persons and other items for weapons and other types of contraband is becoming essential at security checkpoints, such as those found at airports, concerts, sporting events, courtrooms, federal buildings, schools and other types of public and private facilities potentially at risk from terrorist attacks. Conventional security inspection systems currently in place at security checkpoints include physical inspection, such as visual and/or tactile inspection, performed by security personnel, metal detectors and X-ray systems. However, physical inspection by security personnel is tedious, unreliable and invasive. In addition, metal detectors are prone to false alarms, and are not capable of detecting non-metallic objects, such as plastic or liquid explosives, plastic or ceramic handguns or knives and drugs. Furthermore, X-ray systems pose a health risk, particularly to those people who are repeatedly exposed to X-ray radiation, such as airport personnel, and X-ray systems also are not able detect certain materials/geometries, such as ceramic knives.",
        "As a result of the need for improved security inspection systems, various microwave imaging systems have been proposed as an alternative to existing systems. Microwave radiation is generally defined as electromagnetic radiation having wavelengths between radio waves and infrared waves. An advantage of microwave radiation over X-ray radiation is that microwave radiation is non-ionizing, and therefore, poses no known health risks to people at moderate power levels. In addition, over the spectral band of microwave radiation, most dielectric materials, such as clothing, paper, plastic and leather are nearly transparent. Therefore, microwave imaging systems have the ability to penetrate clothing to image items concealed by clothing.",
        "At present, there are several microwave imaging techniques available. For example, one technique uses an array of microwave detectors to capture either passive microwave energy emitted by the target or reflected microwave energy reflected from the target in response to active microwave illumination of the target. A two-dimensional or three-dimensional image of a person or other item is constructed by scanning (moving) the array of detectors with respect to the item's position and/or adjusting the frequency (or wavelength) of the microwave energy being transmitted or detected. For example, an article by David M. Sheen et al., \u201cThree-Dimensional Millimeter-Wave Imaging for Concealed Weapon Detection,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, Vol. 49, No. 9, September 2001, pp. 1581-1592 describes a three-dimensional holographic microwave imaging technique that uses a scanning bar to mechanically move a linear array of detectors to scan an item or person. The resulting measured data is used to reconstruct a holographic image of the item. However, such scanning systems typically require mechanically moving parts and/or intensive post-processing reconstruction of the image, both of which increase the cost and complexity of the microwave imaging system.",
        "Another technique uses lenses to focus a beam of microwave illumination on the array of microwave detectors. This type of technique is described, for example, in the article P. F. Goldsmith, et al., \u201cFocal Plane Imaging Systems for Millimeter Wavelengths,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, Vol. 41, No. 10, October 1993, pp. 1664-1675. However, microwave imaging systems that use lenses to focus the microwave energy typically have a limited field of view and small aperture size. In addition, the cost of the lens system may be prohibitively large in many applications.",
        "Therefore, what is needed is a cost-effective and simple microwave imaging system for use in security inspection of persons or other items that does not require any moving parts.",
        "Embodiments of the present invention provide a microwave imaging system that uses microwave radiation to image targets. The system includes a microwave source for providing microwave illumination to illuminate a target, a microwave receiver for receiving reflected microwave illumination reflected from the target and an array of antenna elements. The antenna elements are capable of being programmed with a respective transmission coefficient to direct the microwave illumination from the microwave source toward a position on the target. The antenna elements are further capable of being programmed with a respective additional transmission coefficient to receive reflected microwave illumination reflected from the position on the target and direct the reflected microwave illumination towards the microwave receiver. A processor is operable to measure an intensity of the reflected microwave illumination to determine a value of a pixel within an image of the target. Multiple beams can be directed towards the target to obtain corresponding pixel values for use by the processor in constructing the image.",

Each of the reflecting antenna elements is capable of being programmed with a respective phase delay to direct microwave illumination towards the human subject 30 and/or towards one of the microwave antennas 60. The phase delay can be either binary or continuous.",
        "For example, in one embodiment, one of the microwave antennas 60 is a receiving microwave antenna 60 positioned at a predetermined spatial location. Microwave illumination received by one of the scanning panels 50 from a target position on the human subject 20 is reflected towards the receiving microwave antenna 60 by programming each of the individual reflecting antenna elements with a respective phase delay. The transmitting microwave antenna 60 can be positioned either in the same spatial location as the receiving microwave antenna 60 as a separate antenna or as part of the receiving microwave antenna, and illuminate the target position through the scanning panel 50, or can be positioned at a different spatial location from the receiving microwave antenna 60 and either illuminate the target position on the human subject 30 directly or through one of the scanning panels 50 (e.g., the same scanning panel 50 as the receiving microwave antenna 60 or a different scanning panel 50).",
        "In another embodiment, one or more of the scanning panels 50 includes an active transmitter/receiver array composed of active antenna elements capable of producing and transmitting microwave illumination and receiving and capturing reflected microwave illumination. For example, the active array may be in the form of a transmission array. In this embodiment, microwave antennas 60 are not used, as the scanning panels 50 operate as the source of microwave radiation. Each of the active antenna elements in the active transmitter/receiver array is individually programmable with a respective phase shift to steer a beam of microwave illumination towards a target position on the human subject 30.",
        "The microwave imaging system 10 further includes a processor 100, computer-readable medium 110 and a display 120. The processor 100 includes any hardware, software, firmware, or combination thereof for controlling the scanning panels 50 and microwave antennas 60 and processing the received microwave illumination reflected from the human subject 30 to construct a microwave image of the human subject 30. For example, the processor 100 may include one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, programmable logic devices, digital signal processors or other type of processing devices that are configured to execute instructions of a computer program, and one or more memories (e.g., cache memory) that store the instructions and other data used by the processor 100. However, it should be understood that other embodiments of the processor 100 may be used. The memory 110 is any type of data storage device, including but not limited to, a hard drive, random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), compact disc, floppy disc, ZIP\u00ae drive, tape drive, database or other type of storage device or storage medium.",
        "The processor 100 operates to program the phase delays or phase shifts of each of the individual antenna elements in the scanning panels 50 to illuminate multiple target positions on the human subject 30 with microwave radiation and/or receive reflected microwave illumination from multiple target positions on the human subject 30. Thus, the processor 100 in conjunction with the scanning panels 50 operates to scan the human subject 30.",
        "The processor 100 is further capable of constructing a microwave image of the human subject 30 using the intensity of the reflected microwave illumination received by the receiving microwave antennas 60 from each target position on the human subject 30. Each receiving microwave antenna 60 is capable of combining the reflected microwave illumination reflected from each antenna element in one of the scanning panels 50 to produce a value of the effective intensity of the reflected microwave illumination at the target position on the human subject 30. The intensity value is passed to the processor 110, which uses the intensity value as the value of a pixel corresponding to the target position on the human subject 30.",
        "The processor 100 receives multiple intensity values from each of the receiving microwave antennas 60, and combines the intensity values to produce the microwave image of the human subject 30. For example, the processor 100 associates a received intensity value with a target position on the human subject and populates the value of a pixel in the microwave image with the received intensity value. The location of the populated pixel in the microwave image corresponds to the target position on the human subject 30. In operation, the microwave security inspection system 10 can operate at frequencies that enable millions of target positions on the human subject 30 to be scanned per second.",
        "The resulting microwave image of the human subject 30 can be passed from the processor 100 to the display 120 to display the microwave image of the human subject 30. In one embodiment, the display 120 is a two-dimensional display for displaying a three-dimensional microwave image of the human subject 30 or one or more two-dimensional microwave images of the human subject 30. In another embodiment, the display 120 is a three-dimensional display capable of displaying a three-dimensional microwave image of the human subject 30.",
        "FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of a simplified exemplary scanning panel 50 for use in the inspection system of FIG. 1, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The scanning panel 50 in FIG. 2 is a reflector antenna array that includes distinct reflecting antenna elements 200 that reflect electromagnetic radiation with varying phase depending on their impedance state, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/997422. Ideally, the reflecting antenna elements 200 reflect electromagnetic radiation with a phase shift of 180 degrees (binary phase-shifted) when their impedance is high relative to when their impedance is low. The reflecting antenna elements 200 are individually controllable and the reflector antenna array is typically supported by driver electronics (not shown in FIG. 2). The reflector antenna array is formed on and/or in a substrate, such as a printed circuit board. In one example, the reflector antenna array has a surface area of approximately one meter square and is covered with 10,000 to 100,000 individually controllable reflecting antenna elements 200 arranged in rows 210 and columns 220.",
        "Each reflecting antenna element 200 includes an antenna and a non-ideal switching device. The antenna functions to absorb or reflect a beam of electromagnetic radiation to varying degrees depending on the impedance level of the reflecting antenna element 200. Example antenna types that can be incorporated into a reflector antenna array include patch, dipole, monopole, loop, and dielectric resonator type antennas. In reflector antenna array applications, the antennas are often formed in a single plane on the surface of the reflector antenna array substrate. The antennas have an impedance characteristic that is a function of the antenna design parameters. Design parameters of antennas include but are not limited to, physical attributes such as the dielectric material of construction, the thickness of the dielectric material, shape of the antenna, length and width of the antenna, feed location, and thickness of the antenna metal layer.",
        "The non-ideal switching device changes the impedance state of the reflecting antenna element 200 by changing its resistive state. A low resistive state (e.g., a closed or \u201cshort\u201d circuit) translates to a low impedance. Conversely, a high resistive state (e.g., an open circuit) translates to a high impedance. A switching device with ideal performance characteristics (referred to herein as an \u201cideal\u201d switching device) produces effectively zero impedance (Z=0) when its resistance is at its lowest state and effectively infinite impedance (Z=\u221e) when its resistance is at its highest state. As described herein, a switching device is \u201con\u201d when its impedance is at its lowest state (e.g., Zon=0) and \u201coff\u201d when its impedance is at its highest state (e.g., Zoff=\u221e). Because the on and off impedance states of an ideal switching device are effectively Zon=0 and Zoff=\u221e, an ideal switching device is able to provide the maximum phase shift without absorption of electromagnetic radiation between the on and off states. That is, the ideal switching device is able to provide switching between 0 and 180 degree phase states. In the case of an ideal switching device, maximum phase-amplitude performance can be achieved with an antenna that exhibits any finite non-zero impedance.",
        "In contrast to an ideal switching device, a \u201cnon-ideal\u201d switching device is a switching device that does not exhibit on and off impedance states of Zon=0 and Zoff=\u221e, respectively. Rather, the on and off impedance states of a non-ideal switching device are, for example, somewhere between Zon=0 and Zoff=4. A non-ideal switching device may exhibit ideal impedance characteristics within certain frequency ranges (e.g., <10 GHz) and highly non-ideal impedance characteristics at other frequency ranges (e.g., >20 GHz).",
        "Because the on and off impedance states of a non-ideal switching device are somewhere between Zon=0 and Zoff=4, the non-ideal switching device does not necessarily provide the maximum phase state performance regardless of the impedance of the corresponding antenna, where maximum phase state performance involves switching between 0 and 180 degree phase states. In accordance with the invention, the antennas of a reflector antenna array that utilizes non-ideal switching devices are specifically designed to provide optimal phase performance, where the optimal phase state performance of a reflecting antenna element is the point at which the reflecting element is closest to switching between 0 and 180 degree phase-amplitude states. In an embodiment, to achieve optimal phase state performance, the antennas are configured as a function of the impedance of the non-ideal switching devices. For example, the antennas are designed such that the impedance of the antennas is a function of impedance characteristics of the non-ideal switching devices.",
        "Further, the antennas are configured as a function of the impedance of the non-ideal switching devices in the on state, Zon, and the impedance of the non-ideal switching device in the off state, Zoff. In a particular embodiment, the phase state performance of a reflecting element is optimized when the antennas are configured such that the impedance of each antenna is conjugate to the square root of the impedance of the non-ideal switching devices when in the on and off impedance states, Zon and Zoff. Specifically, the impedance of each antenna is the complex conjugate of the geometric mean of the on and off impedance states, Zon and Zoff, of the corresponding non-ideal switching device. This relationship is represented as:\n\nZantenna*=\u221a{square root over (ZonZoff)}\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nThe above-described relationship is derived using the well-known formula for the complex reflection coefficient between a source impedance and a load impedance. Choosing the source to be the antenna and the load to be the non-ideal switching device, the on-state reflection coefficient is set to be equal to the opposite of the off-state reflection coefficient to arrive at equation (1).",
        "Designing an antenna that exhibits optimal phase-amplitude performance involves determining the on and off impedances, Zon and Zoff of the particular non-ideal switching device that is used in the reflecting antenna elements 200. Design parameters of the antenna are then manipulated to produce an antenna with an impedance that matches the relationship expressed in equation (1) above. An antenna that satisfies equation (1) can be designed as long as Zon and Zoff are determined to be distinct values.",
        "Types of switching devices that exhibit non-ideal impedance characteristics over the frequency band of interest include low cost surface mount devices such as surface mount field effect transistors (FETs) and surface mount diodes. Although surface mount FETs exhibit non-ideal impedance characteristics over the frequency band of interest, they are relatively inexpensive and can be individually packaged for use in reflector antenna array applications.",
        "In an embodiment, the antennas in the reflector antenna array are planar patch antennas. FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of an antenna element 200 that utilizes a planar patch antenna 320a with a surface mounted FET 322 as the non-ideal switching device, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The reflecting antenna element 200 is formed on and in a printed circuit board substrate 314 and includes the surface mounted FET 322, a patch antenna 320a, a drain via 332, a ground plane 336 and a source via 338. The surface mounted FET 322 is mounted on the opposite side of the printed circuit board substrate 314 as the planar patch antenna 320a and the ground plane 336 is located between the planar patch antenna 320a and the surface mounted FET 322. The drain via 332 connects the drain 328 of the surface mounted FET 322 to the planar patch antenna 320a and the source via 338 connects the source 326 of the surface mounted FET 322 to the ground plane 336. In one embodiment, the surface mounted FETs 322 are placed on the printed circuit board substrate 314 using a robotic \u201cpick and place\u201d process and then wave soldered to the printed circuit board 314.",
        "In a working product, the reflector antenna array is connectable to a controller board 340 that includes driver electronics. An example controller board 340 is also depicted in FIG. 3 and includes a ground plane 344, a drive signal via 346, and driver electronics 342. The controller board 340 also includes connectors 348 that are compatible with connectors 350 of the reflector antenna array. The connectors 348 of the two boards can be connected to each other, for example, using wave soldering. It should be understood that in other embodiments, the FET 322 can be surface mounted on the same side of the printed circuit board substrate 314 as the planar patch antenna 320a. Additionally, the driver electronics 342 can be soldered directly to the same printed circuit board in which the reflecting antenna element 200 is built.",
        "In a reflector antenna array that utilizes FETs as the non-ideal switching devices, the beam-scanning speed that can be achieved depends on a number of factors including signal-to-noise ratio, crosstalk, and switching time. In the case of a FET, the switching time depends on gate capacitance, drain-source capacitance, and channel resistance (i.e., drain-source resistance). The channel resistance is actually space-dependent as well as time-dependent. In order to minimize the switching time between impedance states, the drain of the FET is DC-shorted at all times. The drain is DC-shorted at all times because floating the drain presents a large off-state channel resistance as well as a large drain-source capacitance due to the huge parallel-plate area of the patch antenna. This implies that the antenna is DC-shorted but one wishes the only \u201crf short\u201d the antenna sees be at the source. Therefore, the additional antenna/drain short must be optimally located so as to minimally perturb the antenna.",
        "In other embodiments, the reflector antenna array can include continuous phase-shifted antenna elements 200 by replacing the FETs with variable capacitors (e.g., Barium Strontium Titanate (BST) capacitors). With the variable capacitor loaded patches, continuous phase shifting can be achieved for each antenna element 200, instead of the binary phase shifting produced by the FET loaded patches. Continuous phased arrays can be adjusted to provide any desired phase shift in order to steer a microwave beam towards any direction in a beam scanning pattern.",
        "In further embodiments, the scanning panel is an active transmit/receive array including active antenna elements. An example of an active antenna element 1200 for use in an transmit/receive array is shown in FIG. 12 and described in co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/997,583. The active antenna element 1200 is a broadband binary phased antenna element including an antenna 1210 connected to a respective switch 1215. The switch 1215 can be, for example, a single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switch or a double-pole double-throw (DPDT) switch. The operating state of the switch 1215 controls the phase of the respective antenna element 1200. For example, in a first operating state of the switch 1215, the antenna element 1200 may be in a first binary state (e.g., 0 degrees), while in a second operating state of the switch 1215, the antenna element 1200 may be in a second binary state (e.g., 180 degrees). The operating state of the switch 1215 defines the terminal connections of the switch 1215. For example, in the first operating state, terminal 1218 may be in a closed (short circuit) position to connect feed line 1216 between the antenna 1210 and the switch 1215, while terminal 1219 may be in an open position. The operating state of each switch 1215 is independently controlled by a control circuit (not shown) to individually set the phase of each antenna element 1200.",
        "As used herein, the term symmetric antenna 1210 refers to an antenna that can be tapped or fed at either of two feed points 1211 or 1213 to create one of two opposite symmetric field distributions or electric currents. As shown in FIG. 12, the two opposite symmetric field distributions are created by using a symmetric antenna 1210 that is symmetric in shape about a mirror axis 1250 thereof. The mirror axis 1250 passes through the antenna 1210 to create two symmetrical sides 1252 and 1254. The feed points 1211 and 1213 are located on either side 1252 and 1254 of the mirror axis 1250 of the antenna 1210. In one embodiment, the feed points 1211 and 1213 are positioned on the antenna 1210 substantially symmetrical about the mirror axis 1250. For example, the mirror axis 1250 can run parallel to one dimension 1260 (e.g., length, width, height, etc.) of the antenna 1210, and the feed points 1211 and 1213 can be positioned near a midpoint 1270 of the dimension 1260. In FIG. 12, the feed points 1211 and 1213 are shown positioned near a midpoint 1270 of the antenna 1210 on each side 1252 and 1254 of the mirror axis 1250.",
        "The symmetric antenna 1210 is capable of producing two opposite symmetric field distributions, labeled A and B. The magnitude (e.g., power) of field distribution A is substantially identical to the magnitude of field distribution B, but the phase of field distribution A differs from the phase of field distribution B by 180 degrees. Thus, field distribution A resembles field distribution B at \u00b1180\u00b0 in the electrical cycle.",
        "The symmetric antenna 1210 is connected to the symmetric switch 1215 via feed lines 1216 and 1217. Feed point 1211 is connected to terminal 1218 of the symmetric switch 1215 via feed line 1216, and feed point 1213 is connected to terminal 1219 of the symmetric switch 1215 via feed line 1217. As used herein, the term symmetric switch refers to either a SPDT or DPDT switch in which the two operating states of the switch are symmetric about the terminals 1218 and 1219.",
        "For example, if in a first operating state of a SPDT switch, the impedance of channel \u03b1 is 10\u03a9 and the impedance of channel \u03b2 is 1 k\u03a9, then in the second operating state of the SPDT switch, the impedance of channel \u03b1 is 1 k\u03a9 and the impedance of channel \u03b2 is 10\u03a9. It should be understood that the channel impedances are not required to be perfect opens or shorts or even real. In addition, there may be crosstalk between the channels, as long as the crosstalk is state-symmetric. In general, a switch is symmetric if the S-parameter matrix of the switch is identical in the two operating states of the switch (e.g., between the two terminals 1218 and 1219).",
        "It should be understood that other types of antenna elements and scanning panels may be used to transmit, receive and/or reflect microwave illumination to and from a human subject or other item being scanned. In addition, it should be understood that multiple scanning panels may be used to scan different portions of the human subject or other item. For example, the microwave security inspection system can be implemented with two scanning panels, each including a 1 m\u00d71 m array of antenna elements to scan half of a human subject. As another example, the microwave security inspection system can be implemented with four scanning panels, each including a 0.5 m\u00d70.5 m array of antenna elements capable of scanning a quadrant of the human subject.",

The phase delays are selected to create positive interference of the reflected microwave illumination 410 from each of the antenna elements 200 at the target 420. Ideally, the phase shift of each of the antenna elements 200 is adjusted to provide the same phase delay for each path of the reflected microwave illumination 410 from the source (antenna element 200) to the target 420.",

In addition, although two horns 60a and 60b are shown in FIG. 13, in other embodiments, a single horn is used to both transmit microwave illumination 1310 and receive reflected microwave illumination 1340. In further embodiments, hybrid designs are possible where one of the scanning panels 50a or 50b is a reflector array illuminated in front and the other scanning panel 50a or 50b is a transmission array illuminated from behind. In still further embodiments, non-confocal designs are possible using a single scanning panel 50a or 50b, where either horn 60a blanket illuminates the target 1300 with microwave illumination 1310 or horn 60b blanket receives the reflected microwave illumination 1330 from the target 1300.",

To address a particular point (target 420) on the human subject 30, microwave illumination 500 is radiated from a particular microwave antenna (e.g., microwave antenna 60d) towards a particular scanning panel (e.g., scanning panel 50d). The antenna elements in the scanning panel 50d are each programmed with a respective phase delay to reflect the microwave illumination 500 and direct reflected microwave illumination 510 towards the target 420. This phase delay will also insure the focusing of the reflected wave from the target 420 toward the receiving antenna 60d.",

Each radiation pattern 800 and 810 represents a beam of microwave illumination having a particular beam width that determines the resolution of the image, where large beam widths produce poor resolution.
