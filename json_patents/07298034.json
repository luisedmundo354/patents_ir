        "The present invention relates, in general, to electronics, and more particularly, to methods of forming semiconductor devices and packaging therefor.",
        "In the past, the semiconductor industry utilized a variety of package configurations to increase the packing density of semiconductor die in a system. The increased demand for electronic devices increased the demand for smaller, lighter, and yet more functional semiconductor devices and resulted in a demand for semiconductor packages that had increased semiconductor packaging densities with smaller outlines and mounting footprints. In some embodiments, semiconductor die were vertically stack on top of one another with an interposing layer of adhesive to attached to the semiconductor die in order to attach the die together. The die were then attached to a glass-epoxy type printed circuit board substrate or other similar substrate. The semiconductor die were then wire bonded to the substrate to form electrical interconnections between the substrate and the semiconductor die. One example of such a package configuration is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,650,019 issued to Thomas B. Glenn et al on Nov. 18, 2003.",
        "It often took considerable horizontal space to wire bond to both of the semiconductor die which increased the footprint. Further, wire bonding to the semiconductor die consumed additional vertical space which increased the height. Another problem with such a configuration was thermal dissipation. The attachment medium used to attach the two die together often had low thermal conductivity, which reduced the thermal conductivity of the configuration and minimized the power dissipation capability of the configuration.",
        "Accordingly, it is desirable to have a means of attaching multiple die together, that provides high thermal conductivity, that does not require wire bonding, and that has a small footprint.",

This description has references to both FIG. 1 and FIG. 2. Assembly 35 also includes a second multi-chip semiconductor connector 38 that is an alternate embodiment of connector 20 that was explained in the description of FIG. 1. Connector 38 includes a first conductive strip 39 that has support portion 23, connection portion 22, and a first attachment area 41. A second conductive strip 40 of connector 38 has support portion 30, connection portion 28, and a second attachment area 42. Connector 38 and strips 39 and 40 are identified in a general way by arrows. Methods for forming connectors 20 and 38 are disclosed in a related patent application entitled \u201cMulti-Chip Semiconductor Connector and Method\u201d having inventors Carney et al which previously was incorporated herein by reference.",
        "Semiconductor die 36 and 37 typically have a top side or front side 48 that has a plurality of connection points and a bottom or backside 49 that typically has a single connection point. Such backside and front side connection points and electrodes and methods of forming them are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, die 36 and 37 may be power transistors that have a source and gate connection point on front side 48 and a drain connection point on backside 49. One or both of die 36 and 37 may also be a diode, an IGBT, an analog or a digital logic semiconductor device, or any other type of semiconductor device. The different connection points on each of die 36 and 37 may have different sized attachment pads or connection points, thus, the attachment area of connectors 20 and 38 may have different sizes or surface areas in order to mate to the corresponding connection points on die 36 and 37. For example, a source pad or source connection point may have a larger surface area than a gate pad or gate connection point in order to support a larger current flow, and a drain pad or drain connection point may have an even larger area than the source connection point. Consequently, attachment areas 41 and 42 of connector 38 are formed to have a larger surface area than attachment areas 21 and 29 in order to mate to the respective connection points of die 36 and 37.",
        "In order to form electrical connection to the connection points of die 36 and 37, strips 31, 32, 39, and 40 typically are formed from a conductive material that is suitable for being attached to the connection pads of die 36 and 37, such as solder or conductive epoxy, and that provides a low resistance electrical conduction path. Additionally, connection portions 23, and 30 assist in supporting the weight of assembly 35, thus, the material utilized to form connectors 20 and 38 must also provide rigidity and support. Insulator 26 provides electrical insulation between strips 31 and 32 and between strips 39 and 40 and also provides sufficient rigidity to support at least the weight of die 37. It will be appreciated that strips 31, 32, 39, and 40 may all have different widths and thickness. Although each of strips 31 and 32 are illustrated to have connection portions extending from only one side, it will be appreciated that any of strips 31 and 32 may have connection portions extending from all four sides of support portions 22 and 28, or extending from only one side, or extending from any combination of sides. Attachment areas 21, 29, 41, and 42 typically are formed as raised areas on a portion of the surface of support portions 22 and 28. Areas 21 and 41, and areas 29 and 42 typically extend a first distance 53 from a surface of respective portions 22 and 28, for example extending from surface 24 of portion 22. As will be seen further hereinafter, first distance 53 typically is selected to be at least as large as the bond-line thickness of the attachment material that is utilized to attach areas 21 and 41 to die 37 and areas 29 and 42 to die 36. Additionally, first distance 53 should be sufficient to ensure that the attachment material utilized to attach connectors 20 and 38 to die 36 and 37 sufficiently wets to areas 21, 29, 41, and 42. The surface area of each of attachment areas 21, 29, 41, and 42 generally are formed to be less than the surface area of the exposed part of the corresponding connection point of dies 36 and 37. As is well known in the art, a portion of the connection points on die 36 and 37 may be covered by a passivation layer, thus, the exposed surface area of the connection point may be less than the total surface area of the connection point. In most embodiments, support portions 23 and 30 are formed in a different plane from the plane of connection portions 22 and 28 so that portions 23 and 30 may function as leads that provide external connections to die 36 and 37. A distal end 33 of strips 31 and 39 and a distal end 34 of strips 32 and 40 generally are used to attach assembly 35 to an intermediate substrate such as a printed circuit board or a ceramic substrate or onto a semiconductor leadframe, or may be used as an assembly that is encapsulated to form a semiconductor package. Connectors 20 and 38 are mechanically attached to and electrically connected to die 36 and 37 so that die 36 and 37 generally are in different planes. As can be seen, at least the surface of front side 48 of die 37 is in a different plane from the surface of backside 49 of die 36. Typically, the two planes do not intersect. In most embodiments, the two planes are approximately parallel.",
        "FIG. 3 schematically illustrates an enlarged cross-sectional portion of an embodiment of a semiconductor device 50 that utilizes assembly 35 within a semiconductor package 54 having a package body 51. Package 54 is illustrated in a general way by an arrow. Backside 49 of die 36 typically is attached to a conductor in order to form electrical contact to backside 49. The conductor usually is a die attach area or flag 44 of a semiconductor package leadframe. Additionally, a conductor 43 may be attached backside 49 of die 37 to provide electrical connection thereto. Conductor 43 typically is similar to one of strips 32 or 40.",
        "Distal ends 33 and 34, flag 44, and the distal end of conductor 43 generally are at least substantially coplanar with a bottom surface of body 51. In some embodiments, ends 33 and 34 may extend past the bottom surface of body 51. The mechanical attachment of connectors 20 and 38 to die 36 and 37 facilitates reducing the height or thickness of package 54.",
        "In one example embodiment of assembly 35 and package 54, die 36 and 37 are power transistors. In this embodiment, attachment area 21 is attached to a gate electrode of die 37, attachment area 29 is attached to a gate electrode of die 36, attachment area 41 is attached to a source electrode of die 37, attachment area 42 is attached to a source electrode of die 36, flag 44 is attached to a drain electrode of die 36, and conductor 43 is attached to a drain electrode of die 36.",
        "The rigidly of strips 31, 32, 39, and 40 mechanically support die 36 and 37 and eliminates the need for an insulating material attached to die 36 and 37 and between die 36 and 37 to provide the mechanical support. The large surface area of strips 31, 32, 39, and 40 provides low resistance and high thermal conductivity thereby increasing the thermal capacity of package 54 and reducing the lead resistance.",
        "FIG. 4 schematically illustrates an enlarged cross-sectional portion of a multi-chip semiconductor connector 46 that is an alternate embodiment of connectors 20 and 38 that were explained in the description of FIG. 1 through FIG. 3. Connector 46 is utilized to form a mechanical attachment to and a common electrical connection between two semiconductor die such as die 36 and die 37, instead of electrically isolated connections that were formed by connectors 20 and 38. Connector 46 includes a first attachment area 47 on a top surface of portion 28 and second attachment area 29 on bottom surface 25 of portion 22. The surface area of attachment area 47 is larger than the surface area of attachment area 29 in order to provide a low resistance connection between semiconductor die connection points that have different sizes. Alternately, areas 47 and 29 may have the same size in order to provide electrical connection between two connection points of the same size, for example two source connection points.",

Insulator 176 usually is formed to have a thickness so that the thickness or height of connector 175 is substantially the same as the thickness or height of connector 161, connector 164, and die 171. Alternately, the thickness of strips 31 or 32, or the thickness of attachment areas 21 or 29 may be adjusted to keep the height or thickness of connector 175 approximately equal to that of connector 161, connector 164, and die 171 to assist in keeping the plane in which die 36 is positioned substantially coplanar to the plane in which die 37 is positioned.",

        "In a first embodiment of device 110, package 117 is formed in a configuration commonly referred to as a QFN type package, die 119 is a power transistor that is oriented in a manner similar to die 36 (See FIG. 2), and die 120 is an analog power transistor driver device that is suitable for receiving signals and responsively enabling and disabling a power transistor. Such driver devices are well known to those skilled in the art. Front side 48 of die 119 typically has a plurality of connection points, such as a source and a gate, and backside side 49 typically has a single connection point, such as a drain. Backside 49 of die 119 is mechanically and electrically attached to flag 118, thus, to lead 116.

In this first embodiment, die 120 is attached to attachment area 122 by an electrically insulating medium such as non-conductive epoxy. Thus, die 120 is electrically isolated from connector 121 and from the electrical connection that connector 121 forms with die 119.",
        "Assembly 109 can be formed by the same techniques used to form assembly 35 and package 50. Die 119 typically is die bonded to flag 118. Thereafter, the attachment medium may be placed on the connection point of die 119 and on leads 114 and 115. Then, connector 121 may be placed onto the medium with area 125 overlying the connection point of die 119 and with portion 124 overlying leads 114 and 115. The attachment medium can then be activated to attach connector 121 to die 119 and leads 114 and 115. For example, if the attachment medium is solder, the solder can be reflowed to complete the activation or if the attachment medium is conductive epoxy, the epoxy can be cured to complete the attachment. Subsequently, a non-conductive epoxy can be used to attach die 120 to area 122. Leads 112 and 113 can be wire bonded to the corresponding connection points of die 119 and 120. For example, connection points on die 120 may be wire-bonded to a current sense connection point and a gate connection point of die 119 by respective bonding wires 126 and 127. Other connection points of die 120 can be wire-bonded to leads 112 and 113 respective bonding wires 128 and 129.

Device 185 includes a plurality of multi-chip semiconductor connectors including multi-chip semiconductor connectors 186 and 200 that are alternate embodiments of connectors 20 and 38 (see FIG. 2).

Attachment areas 188 and 202 are electrically connected to and mechanically attached to connections points on die 120. A conductor such as conductor 43 may be attached to the backside of die 120 and to leadframe 144. A distal end of conductor 43 may electrically connected to one of leads 145 through 149.",
        "As can be seen, the connection portions and the support portions of the conductive strips of connectors 186 and 200 may have various shapes in order to route the electrical connections from the connection points of the respective semiconductor die to other points such as to leads of a leadframe, to conductors of a substrate such as a ceramic substrate or a printed circuit board or a flex tape, or to other conductors external to the semiconductor die and external to the multi-chip semiconductor connectors. The various shapes may be within a plane parallel to the attachment areas or may be in other planes. For example, a first portion of the conductive portion of strip 201 extends away from attachment area 202 for a distance 210 and makes a first right angle turn all within a first plane, a second portion of the conductive portion of strip 201 extends a second distance 211 within the first plane away from the first right angle and makes a second right angle turn out of the first plane, a third portion of the conductive portion of strip 201 extends within a second plane a third distance 212 away from the second right angle turn and makes a third right angle turn, a fourth portion of the conductive portion of strip 201 extends within a third plane a fourth distance 213 away from the third right angle until merging into connection portion 204. The turns of conductive portion 203 may be made at angles other than right angles.",
        "In view of all of the above, it is evident that a novel device and method is disclosed. Included, among other features, is forming a multi-chip semiconductor assembly by electrically connecting and mechanically attaching a multi-chip semiconductor connector to a plurality of semiconductor die. The rigidity of the multi-chip semiconductor connector provides support for the die and eliminates the need for an intermediate adhesive support layer thereby improving the thermal dissipation of the assembly and packages that use the assembly. Using the connectors to provide electrical connection between the semiconductor die and a semiconductor package reduces the package height and footprint. Additionally, more than two semiconductor die can be attached together to increase the packing density of the packages and any system that uses the packages."
