        "This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/207,127 filed May 25, 2000 and entitled NAVIGATION AND EDITING OF AUDIO INFORMATION OVER THE TELEPHONE and from U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/194,854, filed Apr. 5, 2000, entitled VOICE PORTAL.",
        "The present invention relates to computer network telephony in general, and more particularly to methods and apparatus for telephone and wireless access to computer network-based audio.",
        "Accessing and listening to computer-network based audio content is currently accomplished by transferring audio content from a computer network, such as the Internet, to an end-user's computer, where the audio content is then played. Until recently, audio content was exclusively stored as a computer file that needed to be completely downloaded to the end-user's computer before it could be played. While the recent development of streaming audio technologies, such as REAL AUDIO\u00ae, has provided a measure of concurrency between downloading and playing audio content, a computer with network access is still a required component for retrieving and playing computer-network based audio content.",
        "The process of accessing audio information is composed of many parts. Typically common to all devices is an audio source and multiple clients. When transferring information from an audio source to multiple clients, a number of technologies are typically implemented to make the process more efficient.",
        "One such technology is cache management. Cache management enables enhanced efficiency in the use of bandwidth, so that multiple clients listening to the same information should not have to retrieve it every time from the source.",
        "Normally when downloading audio information, a user downloads from the source to the client and plays the audio from the client side. In a cached environment, the user downloads from the source to a proxy, which caches the information, and from the proxy to the client. It is assumed that the connection between the proxy and the client is better than the connection between the source and the client. An example of a cache management system is Squid (http://www.squid-cache.org).",
        "Another component in servicing audio clients is a streaming server. Streaming is a process by which segments of audio data are transmitted to the client in a way that ensures that the client always has necessary information. A streaming server transmits just the necessary information to the client, for the client to render. At any point in time, the user does not need the complete audio data. For example, when listening to a 3 hour lecture in streaming audio format, the user does not ever need to have the whole 3 hour lecture in memory on the client side. Rather, the user needs only one or two seconds at a time in memory. An example of a streaming audio server is a Real Audio server (www.real.com )",
        "A client receiving a REAL AUDIO\u00ae transmission may find that for some reason the connection has gone bad in the middle of the transmission. One thing a REAL AUDIO\u00ae server may do to deal with this is to \u2018drop off\u2019 packets\u2014by dropping a missed segment and skipping to the next segment. This would be preferable if a user were listening to live radio. Alternatively, the server could continue sending data as if nothing has happened. In each case the user would hear quiet followed by the continued transmission. If packets were dropped, some information would not reach the user.",
        "A third technology used for transferring audio information to the client is multicasting. This technology is employed, for example in an MP3 multicasting server, which multicasts streaming audio. A radio station provides an analog source, which is sent to a radio transmitter and to a transcoder which decodes, mixes and encodes the analog source. A client could be, for example, an Ericsson telephone with an MP3 player attached, as described in: (http://www.ericsson.com/press/mp3player.html),(http://www.ericsson.com/press/telecom99/presskit/mp3.html).",
        "Another technology useful in transferring information from an audio source to multiple clients is Voice Over IP (VoIP). VoIP employs transcoders. A standard telephone may connect to a VoIP Gateway. The VoIP gateway converts the telephone signal into a digital signal, encodes it and sends it through a VoIP Server to another gateway, which decodes it and sends it to another telephone. Two telephones can thus communicate over the Internet. It is also known to employ a PBX to provide radio or MP3 music on hold. This is described, inter alia in (http://www.onholdplus.com/pages/ohp3000.html).",
        "The present invention seeks to provide enhanced telephone functionality, through the use of an Interactive Voice Response Unit (IVR). This functionality may include, for example, an ability to receive a live Internet audio stream via a conventional telephone, navigation and bookmarking of an audio stream, and forwarding audio content, such as an office voicemail, from a PBX connected telephone to a user not directly connected to the PBX.",
        "The present invention seeks to provide methods and apparatus for accessing and retrieving computer-network based audio content via a telephone without requiring that the telephone have computing capabilities.",
        "The present invention allows a user to predefine a set of personal preferences related to audio content via a telephone or a computer for playing audio content on a telephone. The set of personal preferences may be stored on an easily accessible database for later access via telephone. Such personal preferences may include Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) indicating the location of specific audio content on the Internet. The user can access a previously defined set of personal preferences by dialing into an IVR. The user may navigate menus presenting predefined audio content options and make selections by using Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) and/or voice input. Once the user has made a selection, the present invention retrieves the audio content from the Internet and renders it suitable for audio output at the user's telephone.",
        "In a typical scenario, a user may wish to listen to a world news broadcast, such as the BBC World Service at the URL http://www.broadcast.com/bbc/, while traveling. The user accesses a network server of the present invention, establishes a user name and password, and indicates that he would like to receive the BBC World Service broadcast, typically by providing the associated URL or by selecting a predefined URL. Later, the user places a telephone call to an IVR interface of the present invention and enters his user name and password. The user is then presented with a menu of choices, including URLs that the user previously indicated, typically presented by content category. The user then chooses a category that includes the BBC World Service broadcast and then selects the BBC World Service broadcast. Responsive to this selection, the apparatus of the present invention establishes a network connection with http://www.broadcast.com/bbc/, if such a connection has not earlier been established. The network server receives the news broadcast in a streaming audio format, and then renders the streaming audio to provide a telephone output.",
        "There is thus provided, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a system for transmission of audio content to a telephone, the system including an audio stream navigation functionality operable by using a telephone user interface and enabling a user to select audio data to be heard by the user via a telephone, an interactive voice response unit operative in response to an input from the telephone user interface operating the audio stream navigation functionality, and a transcoder operative in response to an input from the interactive voice response unit for providing audio data, from an audio source remote from the transcoder, to the interactive voice response unit for listening by the user via the telephone.",

In FIG. 2, the platform 112 is shown as having one or more conventional Interactive Voice Response (IVR) interfaces 200. Each IVR may communicate with one or more transcoders 202 via a switch 204, such as an IP switch. Each IVR interface 200 is operative to receive telephone and wireless communication from a telephone, such as the telephone 108 and/or the wireless communicator 110 of FIG. 1, or to receive voice and/or DTMF commands. In response thereto, the IVR interface 200 provides audio output.",
        "Each transcoder 202 is operative to communicate with one or more audio content sources, such as a PSTN audio stream 206 or an Internet Stream 209 (IP) using any suitable communication format, and to receive streamed or non-streamed audio content.

        "As input and output bandwidth varies, due to changes in available quality of service or due to other causes, transcoder 202 may adapt its sampling rates accordingly. The transcoder 202 may also adaptively select portions of the audio content input for processing into a form suitable for telephone and wireless output. These portions may be, for example, specific segments of the audio content, as described in greater detail herein below, or specific frequencies that may be selected by using standard filtering techniques. A content manager 208 may also be also provided for managing the interconnections between the IVRs 200, the transcoders 202, and the audio content sources 206 and 209.",

Referring now to FIG. 4A, a user employs the client 100 to establish a communications channel with the server 102 via the computer network 104 (step 400). The user establishes a unique identification via the server 102, or provides a previously established identification to server 102 (step 402). Next, the user communicates the location of audio content on the network 104 to the server 102 and/or selects from among predefined audio content whose locations are configured with the server 102 and presented to the client 100 for selection (step 404). The server 102 then stores the desired audio content indicated by the user in the database 106 (step 406).",
        "It is appreciated that steps 400-406 may additionally or alternatively be carried out by the telephone 108 and/or the wireless communicator 110 in communication with the audio transcoding communications platform 112, as described hereinabove with reference to FIG. 1.",
        "Subsequently, the user contacts the audio transcoding communications platform 112 employing the telephone 108 and/or the wireless communicator 110 and interfaces with the IVR 200 (FIG. 2) using voice and/or a Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) input (step 408). The user is prompted to enter his identification (step 410). The IVR 200 authenticates the user's identity against the database 106. The IVR 200 then requests that the content manager 208 access from the database 106 audio content selections previously provided by the user, other available audio content, or any combination (step 412). The IVR 200 then presents to the user an audible menu of the audio content, typically organized into subject categories (step 414). The user then selects the desired audio content and indicates his selection to the IVR 200 (step 416).",
        "Referring now to FIG. 4B, once the audio content is selected, content manager 208 refers IVR 200 to a specific transcoder 202. A connection is established from the IVR 200 to an available socket on the transcoder 202. (step 418). The content manager 208 selects a specific transcoder 202 in order to maximize usage of transcoder resources. Transcoders 202 are allocated to supply access to a specific stream by the content manager 208 in a manner that preferably limits the number of connections to the outside stream. For instance, should one of the transcoders be currently connected to the BBC World Service via internet stream 236, future requests for access to information from the IVR 200 will be referred by the content manager 208 to that transcoder.",
        "A request socket 302 informs the cache manager 308 of the requested audio content (step 422). The cache manager 308 checks the cache 304 and/or the audio content storage device 122 to see if any of the audio content has been previously cached and/or stored (step 424). Any cached or stored audio content is then retrieved and provided to the IVR 200 for output via the telephone 108 and/or the wireless communicator 110 (step 426).",
        "If the requested audio content is unavailable from cache or storage, the request socket instructs the transcoder 202 to load content. The transcoder 202 selects the audio content player 310 that matches the format of the incoming audio stream (step 428). If the requested content originates from a PSTN source, the PSTN manager 312 connects to the desired PSTN source 206 via the telephonic interface 314 and provides the content to the IVR 200 (step 430). If the requested content originates from a live audio source 126 via the network 104, then audio content player 310 establishes a network connection with the appropriate source via network 104 (step 432).",
        "Optionally, the audio stream may then be modified by the equalizer 320 and the resampler 308. The equalizer 320 may modify the frequencies of audio content, such as by removing high frequencies or adjusting tone and bass. The resampler 306 may change the sampling rate for instance, by converting from 44 kHz to 8 kHz. The resampler 306 preferably contains a converter (not shown), which is capable of converting audio content to 8-bit \u03bc-law format. The audio stream, which leaves the resampler 306 and enters the cache 304, is thus modified into a format that is suitable for telephone and wireless output (step 434). The re-sampled audio stream is then provided to the IVR 200 for output via the telephone 108 and/or the wireless communicator 110 (step 436). Re-sampled content may be optionally cached and/or stored in the cache 304 and/or the storage device 122.",
        "It is appreciated that the existence and validity of audio content may be determined, and audio content may be cached and/or stored in anticipation of serving user requests. It is also appreciated that any of steps 428 through 434 may be performed by platform 112 as sources of audio content are made known to platform 112, preferably prior to serving telephone requests for such audio content. These steps may be performed in a process separate from the method of operation of the system shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B and described hereinabove.",
        "Reference is now made to FIG. 5, which is a simplified flowchart illustration describing a method of operation of FIGS. 1, 2, and 3 providing the functionality of semaphoring audio content, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In the method of FIG. 5, once the transcoder 202 begins providing audio content to the telephone 108 and/or the wireless communicator 110, the user may provide a voice and/or DTMF command to the IVR 200 to indicate the placement of a \u201csemaphore\u201d, operable to mark a position in the audio stream (step 500). The IVR 300 then provides the command to the parser 200, which identifies the command as being a request for semaphore (step 502).",
        "Once the command for a semaphore has been identified, the transcoder 202 instructs the IVR 200 to save the current location of the audio stream in the database 106 (step 504). The platform 112 may additionally be configured to begin caching and/or storing the audio stream from the point where the semaphore is indicated (step 506). Later, when the user reconnects by telephone to the platform 112 and selects the previously semaphored audio content (step 508), the transcoder 202 begins the audio stream from the location of the semaphore, either automatically or upon specific instruction by the user (step 510).",
        "Alternatively, the user 100 may request the future placement of a semaphore. For instance, a user may wish to record a future BBC broadcast of \u2018Letter from America\u2019 scheduled to take place at 3:00am. In one scenario, the user is responsible for providing information regarding the link to be recorded, such as the URL and recording time. The user accesses the IVR, establishes a user name and password, and indicates that he would like to receive the BBC World Service broadcast of \u2018Letter from America\u2019. This is accomplished by providing the associated URL and entering start & finish times for the recording. The system, as described in step 500 will, at the appropriate time, provide a semaphore command to the IVR 200.",
        "Later, when the user wishes to hear the recording, the user places a telephone call to an IVR interface of the present invention and enters his access code and password. The user is then presented with a menu of choices, including URLs that the user previously indicated, typically presented by content category. The user then chooses a category that includes the BBC World Service broadcasts and then selects the \u2018Letter from America\u2019 broadcast. Responsive to this selection, the transcoder 202 of the present invention establishes a network connection with http://www.broadcast.com/bbc/, if such a connection has not earlier been established. The network server receives the news broadcast in a streaming audio format, and then renders the streaming audio to provide a telephone output. The IVR 200 then provides the command to the parser 300, which identifies the command as being a request for a semaphore (step 502). Once the command for a semaphore has been identified, the transcoder 202 instructs the IVR 200 to save the current offset of the audio stream in the database 106 (step 504).",
        "The platform 112 may additionally be configured to begin caching and/or storing the audio stream from the location where the semaphore is indicated (step 506).

        "In an alternative scenario, the system provides the details and the user selects his choices from a menu of pre-configured presentations. The user places a telephone call to an IVR interface of the present invention and enters his user name and password. The user is presented with a main menu and list of options such as \u201cpress 1 for news, press 2 for business\u201d. The user typically selects 1 for news and is presented with an additional list of options. Within the list is the option to \u201cpress 3 to record a program\u201d. The user is given a list of choices of stations to from which to record, such as BBC, CNN or CBS.",
        "The user typically selects the BBC World Service and is presented with a list of programs that are broadcast on the BBC World Service. The user typically selects the program \u2018Letter from America\u2019. The information is stored in a database (not shown) which stores all program data such as URLs and broadcast times.",
