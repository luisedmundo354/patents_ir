        "This invention generally relates to electronic imaging apparatus for fundus imaging and more particularly relates to an improved fundus imaging apparatus using scanned slit illumination and an electronically controlled aperture.",
        "Fundus camera imaging is acknowledged to be an important diagnostic tool for detection of various conditions affecting the eye, including diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Various embodiments of fundus imaging apparatus are disclosed, for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,713,047 (Kohayakawa); U.S. Pat. No. 5,943,116 (Zeimer); U.S. Pat. No. 5,572,266 (Ohtsuka); U.S. Pat. No. 4,838,680 (Nunokawa); U.S. Pat. No. 6,546,198 (Ohtsuka); and U.S. Pat. No. 6,636,696 (Saito).",
        "While these patents attest to continuous improvements in fundus camera design, there are still significant hurdles to widespread acceptance and usability of these devices. Among disadvantages noted with current devices are high cost and complexity, difficulty of operation, large size, and image quality limitations. These disadvantages hinder the successful deployment of fundus cameras in primary care physician (PCP) offices or in medical test labs, where they could be used by a technician having relatively little training in device operation and imaging, to obtain images that can be assessed by specialists at some other location.",
        "A further significant disadvantage of existing fundus imaging apparatus relates to the requirement for pupil dilation. For most patients, artificially induced enlargement of the pupil is necessary in order to allow sufficient light into the eye of the patient for fundus observation and image capture. At best, pupil dilation is uncomfortable and at least temporarily unsettling; at worst, dilation can even be dangerous for some individuals. A number of commercially available fundus imaging systems claim to be \u201cnon-mydriatic\u201d, that is, operable without pupil dilation. However, in practice, pupil dilation is still often required when using these apparatus.",
        "The illumination optics subsystem of a conventional fundus imaging apparatus is designed in such a way that it requires pupil dilation for most patients. In order to provide a truly non-mydriatic fundus imaging system that renders pupil dilation unnecessary and that can be used by relatively untrained personnel, improved design of the illumination system would be required. However, the efforts of designers and manufacturers of these devices have been directed to providing more sophisticated imaging and assessment functions, many of which may actually require dilation in all cases. Thus, the limitations due to illumination subsystem design have been largely ignored and dilation is generally accepted as a requirement. For this reason, it can be seen that there is a need for an improved fundus imaging apparatus having an illumination system that allows fully non-mydriatic retinal imaging for a broad range of patients.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide a fundus imaging apparatus having an improved illumination subsystem and imaging system that promotes non-mydriatic imaging. With this object in mind, the present invention provides an apparatus for obtaining an image of the eye, comprising:\n\n    \n    \n        a) an alignment section for aligning the pupil of the eye along an optical axis;\n        b) a pupil sensor for identifying location and dimensions of the pupil of the eye; and\n        c) an illumination section for directing light through the pupil of the eye.",
        "It is a feature of the present invention that it provides an illumination system for a fundus imaging apparatus that adapts the width of the illumination beam to the dimensions of the pupil, rather than requiring a fixed pupil width, as in conventional systems that require pupil dilation.",
        "It is an advantage of the present invention that it minimizes or eliminates the requirement for pupil dilation for fundus imaging.",
        "It is a further advantage of the present invention that it provides the capability for full-color fundus imaging.",
        "It is yet a further advantage of the present invention that it provides a fundus imaging system with a larger field of view than conventional systems.",

        "The present description is directed in particular to elements forming part of, or cooperating more directly with, apparatus in accordance with the invention. It is to be understood that elements not specifically shown or described may take various forms well known to those skilled in the art.",
        "Conventional Illumination Arrangement",
        "In order to more fully appreciate the improved apparatus and method of the present invention, it is first instructive to review, at a high level, the operation of the illumination subsystem in a conventional fUndus imaging apparatus. Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a hindus imaging apparatus 10 in which a conventional illumination section 12 is used. The patient's eye E is positioned along an optical axis O using an alignment subsystem, not shown in FIG. 1, but described subsequently. Illumination section 12 directs light either from an observation light source 14 and a lens 16 or from an image capture light source 18 and a lens 20 as controlled by control logic circuitry (not shown in FIG. 1). A half-minor 22 directs light from the appropriate source through a ring-slit diaphragm 24 and a lens 26, to an apertured minor 28. Apertured mirror 28 directs the illumination light along axis O and toward the pupil for illuminating the retina of eye E. Depending on the use of hindus imaging apparatus 10 at any one time, either observation light source 14 or image capture light source 18 is activated. Observation light source 14 is typically infrared (IR) light, to which eye E is insensitive. Image capture light source 18, on the other hand, may be a high-brightness source such as a xenon lamp, for example. Depending on the application, image capture light source 18 may be pulsed or strobed.",
        "Ring-slit diaphragm 24 has the characteristic functional arrangement shown in FIG. 2. Light is transmitted through an inner ring 30 and is blocked at a middle section 32 and at an outer section 34. As is shown in the received illumination ring of FIG. 3, inner ring 30 is directed into a pupil 36 of the patient as a ring 40 of illumination. To obtain the retinal image, apertured mirror 28 (FIG. 1) has an aperture suitably centered about optical axis O to allow light that has been reflected from the retina of eye E and directed through lenses 42 and 44 to a sensor 46, such as a CCD.",
        "The high-level block diagram of FIG. 1 thus gives an overview of illumination section 12 that applies for conventional fundus imaging apparatus. There have been numerous methods disclosed for optimizing the performance of illumination section 12, including components arranged to prevent stray reflected light from the cornea of eye E from being directed back toward sensor 46. However, the basic pattern of FIG. 1 is conventionally followed for these devices.",
        "Among disadvantages of this conventional method is the relatively small field that is available. To compensate for this shortcoming, a series of tiled sections is typically imaged. In some cases, conventional image capture uses a narrow range of wavelengths, resulting in monochromatic images. The static ring 40 of illumination as shown in FIG. 3 is disadvantageous, since this ring occupies a portion of the image area during image capture. The combination of ring-slit diaphragm 24 and apertured mirror 28 acts to block scattered rays of illumination from the cornea, thereby obstructing these rays from affecting sensor 46. As yet another disadvantage, alignment of the patient's pupil with the conventional fundus imaging apparatus is time-consuming, since ring 40 must be fully inside the pupil and must avoid the iris.",
        "The apparatus and method of the present invention eliminate the need for a separate ring of illumination, shown as static ring 40 in FIG. 3. Instead, the apparatus and method of the present invention use one or more moving members to selectively partition the illumination beam from either observation light source 14 or image capture light source 18, directing one or more partitions or segments of the illumination beam to eye E and allowing light reflected from the retina of eye E to be detected at sensor 46, while also blocking reflected light from the cornea of eye E from sensing components.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4, there is shown, in block diagram form, an overview of a fundus imaging apparatus 100 of the present invention. An illumination section 112 directs light either from an observation light source 114 and a lens 116 or from an image capture light source 118 and a lens 120 as controlled by control logic circuitry (not shown in FIG. 4). A half-mirror 122 or, alternately, a dichroic surface, directs light from the appropriate source through a transmissive spatial light modulator 125 which, acting as a type of transmissive light valve, provides an electronically controlled aperture 127 for the illumination beam, as described subsequently. The illumination beam is directed by a lens 126 to an illumination beam partitioning mechanism 50.",
        "Illumination beam partitioning mechanism 50 segments the illumination beam cross-sectionally, as is described subsequently. To do this, illumination beam partitioning mechanism 50 uses a reciprocating partitioning member 129 in the embodiment of FIG. 4. Reciprocating partitioning member 129 moves in a direction D and scans one or more segments of the illumination beam through a lens 142 and into the eye E. Reflected light from the retina of eye E is then passed through reciprocating partitioning member 129, with unwanted reflected light from the cornea blocked. The light reflected from the retina is thus directed through a lens 144 to a sensor 146. A display 138, such as a CRT or LCD monitor, may be used in conjunction with sensor 146 and with cornea sensing camera or other sensing components, as described subsequently.",
        "As the overview of FIG. 4 shows, illumination section 112 of the present invention directs the illumination beam from either observation light source 114 or image capture light source 118 toward the eye E and conditions the illumination beam in two ways:\n\n    \n    \n        (i) positioning and shaping the illumination beam through spatial light modulator 125; and\n        (ii) partitioning the illumination beam at reciprocating partitioning member 129 into at least one illuminated segment that receives its corresponding partition of the illumination beam and at least one blocked segment that has its corresponding portion of the illumination beam blocked and, further, scanning the at least one illuminated segment along the field, thereby illuminating the complete field over time.",
        "This dimensioning and conditioning of the illumination beam and method of scanning provide exceptional advantages for effecting a truly non-mydriatic illumination system for retinal imaging. It is worthwhile to observe that, while steps (i) and (ii) above are executed in this order in the embodiments described herein, a different order could be used, so that the illumination beam is first partitioned (step ii, above), then shaped (step i, above).",
        "Shaping the Illumination Beam",
        "The conventional ring-slit illumination method described with reference to FIGS. 1-3 directs a static ring 40 of illumination to the eye E being imaged. Among the problems inherent to this approach is its relatively poor adaptability to the dimensions of the pupil of eye E. Not only can pupils have different diameters from one patient to the next, but the actual shape of the pupil itself can vary from circular shape. Dilated pupils for different patients, for example, can vary in diameter between about 6 and 8 mm. Conventional fundus imaging systems reach some compromise for variable pupil dimensions using methods such as a variety of selectable ring-slit diaphragms 24. For example, a set of different ring-slit diaphragms 24, or other apertured devices, can be provided on a selector wheel or other mechanism, allowing an operator to select the aperture that is best suited to the dimensions of the patient's pupils. Any aperture selected in the place of ring-slit diaphragm 24 is, at best, an approximation and must fit the illumination ring 40 within the outer dimensions of the pupil for best operation. Providing illumination that extends even slightly beyond the borders of the pupil of eye E is not optimal, since stray, diffused light from the surrounding iris of eye E can easily be directed back along optical axis O and degrade image quality obtained at sensor 46.",
        "The apparatus and method of the present invention approaches this problem in a different manner, by shaping the illumination beam according to the detected coordinates of the pupil. This method shapes the illumination beam, when considered in cross-sectional profile, to match dimensional profile of the pupil, in size, placement, and overall shape. Referring to FIG. 5, there is shown, in perspective view, the optical path of illumination to the pupil from image capture light source 118. It must be noted that the same beam shaping operation applies for light from either image capture light source 118 or observation light source 114. In FIG. 5, light from image capture light source 118 is directed through lens 120 toward spatial light modulator 125, which provides an electronically controlled aperture 127 that is sized to correspond to the outline of pupil P of eye E. Electronically controlled aperture 127 provides a mask for the illumination beam to form a shaped illumination beam Ishaped, which is directed through lens 126 and goes to illumination beam partitioning mechanism 50. Here, shaped illumination beam Ishaped, is segmented and reflected from reciprocating partioning member 129 or other component, then through lens 142 to pupil P.",
        "There are a number of ways to provide electronically controlled aperture 127 for conditioning the cross-sectional profile of the illumination beam. Spatial light modulator 125 may be a transmissive LCD, for example, such as an LCD spatial light modulator, blocking light from around electronically controlled aperture 127 in a masking pattern that corresponds to pupil P coordinates and dimensions. In this way, illumination can be directed to the full area of pupil P, but not extending outside the circumference of pupil P.",
        "In one embodiment, the outline of pupil P is detected by an electronic camera or other sensor, as described subsequently. Image data from this camera is processed by a control logic processor 130, as shown in FIG. 5, to determine pupil P position and dimensional coordinates using pattern recognition and other imaging algorithms such as outline detection algorithms, employing methods familiar to those skilled in the imaging arts. Overall, the mechanism used as pupil sensor may have any of a number of components and may be fully automated or require operator interaction, such as for centering of sensor measurements or for verification of pupil outline and dimensions. This pupil sensing subsystem may also include feedback and adjustment mechanisms for adapting to subtle changes in pupil position over time.",
        "It must be noted that mechanisms other than transmissive spatial light modulators 125 could be used to provide electronically controlled aperture 127 for beam shaping. Reflective spatial light modulators and light valves could also be used for this purpose, as is shown in FIG. 17. Here, image capture light source 118 provides light that may be conditioned by a uniformizer 186 or other component and directed, by an optional mirror 184, through lens 120 and to a prism 188 or a beamsplitter of some type. Prism 188 directs the light toward a reflective light valve, such as a digital micromirror device 190 in the embodiment of FIG. 17. Digital micromirror device 190 then provides electronically controlled aperture 127, modulating the incident light to provide, through lens 126, an illumination beam that is shaped, in cross-sectional profile, according to data provided about the dimensions and position of the pupil. A similar arrangement to that of FIG. 17 would be used for a reflective LCD spatial light modulator used in place of digital micromirror device 190, with a polarization beamsplitter providing the light directing function of prism 188.",
        "Partitioning the Illumination Beam",
        "For obtaining an image, the full shaped illumination beam Ishaped provided through spatial light modulator 125 in FIG. 5 cannot be provided to pupil P. If this were to happen, there would be excessive light reflection from the cornea C of eye E, resulting in unacceptably poor image quality. Instead, the present invention provides a cross-sectional partitioning or segmenting of the illumination beam. Referring to the sequence shown in FIGS. 6A-6D, the circular shape represents the two-dimensional shape of the patient's pupil P, to which the two-dimensional cross-section of the illumination beam, as shaped by illumination section 112, corresponds. As described with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5, the shape of P describes the cross-sectional \u201cenvelope\u201d of the illumination beam, as modulated through spatial light modulator 125 or other device that provides electronically controlled aperture 127. Reciprocating partitioning member 129 of FIGS. 4 and 5, acting as illumination beam partitioning mechanism 50, segments the illumination beam to provide one or more light-bearing partitions 150 separated by one or more non-light-bearing partitions 152. Movement of reciprocating partitioning member 129 then scans the segmented illumination provided by light-bearing partitions across the area of pupil P. In the sequence of FIGS. 6A-6D, scanning is effected in the direction of the outlined arrow. Following this overall pattern, reciprocating partitioning member 129 partitions shaped illumination beam Ishaped so that, at any instant, one or more light-bearing partitions 150 or segments of the shaped illumination beam Ishaped are directed into pupil P. These light-bearing partitions 150 are then shifted in position to provide a scanning effect over the pupil that enables the complete image to be obtained over time.",
        "Referring to FIG. 7, the result of this partitioning behavior of reciprocating partitioning member 129 within fundus imaging apparatus 100 is shown for one embodiment. Reciprocating partitioning member 129 reflects shaped illumination beam Ishaped from spatial light modulator 125 along optical axis O towards the pupil P (shown in dotted outline in FIG. 7), with this light segmented into a set of light-bearing partitions 150 separated by non-light-bearing partitions 152. Reflected light R from the eye then travels back along optical axis O. The unwanted reflected light from the cornea is substantially blocked by suitable portions of reciprocating partitioning member 129. The desired light from the retina is transmitted to sensor 146. To provide scanning action that allows a complete image to be obtained over time, an actuator 132 is coupled to reciprocating partitioning member 129 to provide reciprocating movement.",
        "One embodiment of reciprocating partitioning member 129 is shown in FIG. 8. One or more reflective members 154 reflects light into light-bearing partitions 150. Gaps 156 between reflective members 154 correspond to non light-bearing partitions 152 of FIGS. 6A-6D, enabling the return of reflected light from the eye along the optical axis O to sensor 146. As the double arrow in FIG. 8 indicates, reciprocating partitioning member 129 is moved up or down during scanning operation, in order to bathe the complete pupil P of eye E in light over time, using scanned light-bearing partitions 150 to reflect the shaped illumination beam Ishaped appropriately. The arrangement of reflective members 154 can have any number of alternate embodiments for partitioning the shaped illumination beam Ishaped Reciprocating actuation, represented by actuator 132 in FIG. 7, can be provided by any number of electromechanical devices, including a solenoid, motor, piezoelectric actuator, pneumatic device, spring-loaded actuator, or other device. The speed of movement provided for this scanning effect can be varied, based on the response characteristics of sensor 146, the brightness of shaped illumination beam Ishaped, and other factors.",
        "An alternate embodiment for partitioning the pupil as illumination beam partitioning mechanism 50 is shown in FIG. 9. Here, a reciprocating partitioning member 229, disposed within the path of shaped illumination beam Ishaped, has one or more slits 202 that provide an aperture for illumination. A beamsplitter 204 directs the partitioned illumination along optical axis O and toward the eye of the patient, following the general pattern of FIG. 4. Light reflected from the eye, returning along optical axis O, is directed toward sensor 146 though apertures 206. One or more blocking members 208 block light reflected back from the corneal surface, so that the reflected light that goes to sensor 146 is from the retina. For scanning the complete pupil, linear movement is provided in the direction of arrow L in FIG. 9.",
        "As the examples of FIGS. 8 and 9 clearly show, there can be a number of ways for implementing the overall function of illumination beam partitioning mechanism 50 performed by reciprocating partitioning member 129, 229 of the present invention. This component partitions the shaped illumination beam Ishaped into distinct light-bearing and non-light-bearing partitions 150 and 152, scans light-bearing and non-light-bearing partitions 150 and 152 across the pupil to illuminate the full field over time, and blocks unwanted light that is reflected from the cornea.",
        "Fundus Imaging Apparatus",
        "Referring to FIG. 10, there is shown a block diagram of fundus imaging apparatus 100 in one embodiment of the present invention. In addition to illumination section 112 described above, fundus imaging apparatus 100 has an alignment section 160, a cornea focusing section 180, and a retina focusing section 192. FIG. 11 shows an alternate embodiment of a fundus imaging apparatus 200 using reciprocating partitioning member 229.",
        "Alignment section 160 provides aiming and accommodation of the patient's vision, in order to position the eye E favorably for fundus imaging. To simplify description, FIG. 12 isolates the basic components of alignment section 160 from the block diagrams of FIGS. 10 and 11. An aiming target 162, such as an LED or other light source, visible through beamsplitters 172 and 166, is used to direct the eye of the patient to a position that provides visual accommodation. That is, when viewing aiming target 162 through lens 142 and a lens assembly 164, the light entering eye E is substantially collimated. When the light entering eye E is collimated, light from illumination section 112 can be directed to the retina and more accurate focus adjustments can be made. Relative to the coordinate axes shown in FIG. 10, the alignment procedure along optical axis Oa sets the position of eye E along the z axis, and provides alignment positioning relative to the orthogonal x and y axes.",
        "FIGS. 10 and 11 also show different embodiments of illumination section 112 in more detail. A beamsplitter 178 in illumination section 112 directs light from either observation light source 114 or image capture light source 118 through spatial light modulator 125 and lens 126 for beam shaping and to reciprocating partitioning member 129 (FIG. 10) or 229 (FIG. 11) as illumination beam partitioning mechanism 50 for partitioning illumination to the pupil as was described generally with reference to FIGS. 6A-6D. Lenses 182 and 142 direct the shaped and partitioned illumination beam into the pupil of eye E. Beamsplitters 172 and 174 fold optical axis O between lenses 182 and 142.",
        "Once alignment of eye E is achieved, it is necessary to focus on the cornea using cornea focusing section 180. To simplify description, FIG. 13 isolates the basic components of cornea focusing section 180 from the block diagrams of FIGS. 10 and 11. With respect to FIG. 13, the purpose of cornea focusing section 180 is to adjust the focus of lens 142 or, with reference to FIGS. 10 and 11, to adjust for the position of the eye along the z-axis. When necessary to focus the cornea, light sources 176 provide peripheral illumination to the cornea. The reflected light is then directed, through beamsplitters 172 and 166 and through lens 168, to cornea camera 170, which is optically conjugate to the cornea. Cornea camera 170 can be a relatively inexpensive imaging device, requiring only that it have sufficient resolution for focusing. In one embodiment, for example, cornea camera 170 is a CCD camera, model no. IK-52V manufactured by Toshiba.",
        "Achieving proper focus of the cornea allows the retinal image to be obtained. As a first step, partitioned, shaped illumination beam Ishaped is directed onto the cornea, imaging reciprocating partitioning member 129 or 229 onto the cornea. To simplify description for this step, FIG. 14 isolates the basic components used for this phase of retinal focus setup from the block diagrams of FIGS. 10 and 11. Observation light source 114 is conjugate with the cornea. For observation functions, an IR LED or similar source for observation light source 114 is directed through transmissive spatial light modulator 125 for beam shaping and through reciprocating partitioning member 229 and beamsplitter 204 for partitioning, then directed to the cornea of eye E along optical axis O. Cornea camera 170 detects the image of reciprocating partitioning member 229, which can be displayed on an accompanying CRT monitor (not shown) for example.",
        "It must be observed that light sources 176, used for initial stages of cornea focus, are disabled during the step of cornea focus described with respect to FIG. 14. It must also be noted that similar behavior occurs whether reciprocating partitioning member 129 of FIG. 8 or reciprocating partitioning member 229 of FIG. 9 is used. Light-bearing partitions 150 and non-light-bearing partitions 152, once properly focused in this manner, can be scanned over the area of a pupil P to provide full retinal illumination.",
        "Once the partitioned, shaped illumination beam Ishaped is directed onto the cornea for observation, thereby forming an image of reciprocating partitioning member 129 or 229 onto the cornea, final adjustments can be made for sizing electronically controlled aperture 127 provided by transmissive spatial light modulator 125. In addition, any necessary final adjustments to retinal focus can be made. To simplify description for this step, FIG. 15 isolates the basic components used for final retinal focus from the block diagrams of FIGS. 10 and 11.",
        "Referring to FIG. 15, observation light source 114 provides illumination that is shaped and partitioned by illumination section 112, using either reciprocating partitioning member 129 or 229, for example. Lenses 182 and 142 cooperate to focus the partitioned, shaped illumination beam Ishaped onto the cornea. The path of light reflected from the retina goes back through reciprocating partitioning member 129 or 229, which blocks at least a substantial portion of light reflected from the cornea. The retinal image is thereby made available, in scanned partition format, to sensor 146. A preview image Ip is then displayed to the operator to enable focus adjustment of lens 144.",
        "With the retina focused using preview image Ip, the retinal image can now be obtained. To simplify description for this step, FIG. 16 isolates the basic components used for retinal imaging from the block diagrams of FIGS. 10 and 11. Image capture light source 118, typically a visible light source, is now energized, producing a beam of illumination that is shaped and partitioned by illumination section 112, using either reciprocating partitioning member 129 or 229, for example. Lenses 182 and 142 cooperate to focus the partitioned, shaped illumination beam Ishaped onto the cornea. As with the preview illumination described with reference to FIG. 15, the path of light reflected from the retina goes back through reciprocating partitioning member 129 or 229, which blocks at least a substantial portion of light reflected from the cornea. The retinal image is thereby made available, in scanned partition format, to sensor 146. A retina image Ir is then displayed to the operator and can be stored electronically for transfer to some other location or for additional processing.",
        "During image capture, it may be useful to continually recheck eye E alignment as well as cornea and retinal focus. This type of continuous checking could be executed automatically or could be incorporated into operator procedures. For example, light sources 176 could be periodically energized to provide the operator with the opportunity for making any necessary focus readjustments.",
        "The present invention provides a fundus imaging apparatus that is simple to operate, allows compact packaging, and does not require dilation of the pupil for most patients. It must be emphasized that fundus imaging apparatus 100 or 200, as described in the present application, is primarily intended to provide basic fundus imaging that can be inexpensively performed at the office of a PCP or other non-specialist site. Thus, more advanced imaging features and functions are omitted from this description of fundus imaging apparatus 100 and 200. However, the same apparatus and methods used for illumination of the eye described hereinabove could also be applied to a more sophisticated imaging device. In particular, methods for scanning the retina with illumination may prove beneficial for other types of ophthalmic imaging devices.",
        "The invention has been described in detail with particular reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, but it will be understood that variations and modifications can be effected within the scope of the invention as described above, and as noted in the appended claims, by a person of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the various light sources used within fundus imaging apparatus 100 or 200 allow a number of optional types. Sensors and CCD devices could be any of a number of different types. Although the resolution and overall image quality requirements for cornea camera 170 and sensor 146 are quite different, a single CCD array could be used for both cornea camera 170 and sensor 146, switched between these functions, using techniques well known in the imaging arts.",
        "Within illumination beam partitioning mechanism 50, various types of actuators and mechanisms could be used for performing the functions of scanning reciprocating partitioning member 129, 229. Possible actuator types include electromagnetic and piezoelectric actuators or acoustical transducers. Alternately, devices used could be spring-mounted. Other types of electromechanical actuators could be used.",
        "Thus, what is provided is an apparatus and method for fundus imaging using scanned illumination.",
