    "title": "Enhancement of resource reservation protocol enabling short-cut internet protocol connections over a switched network",
    "abstract": "A method and system provide an Internet protocol (IP) session between an originating end-system and a destination end-system through a switched virtual circuit (SVC) short-cut across an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network. A first interworking function (IWF) device inserts its ATM address into a transport network hop (THOP) extension object of a resource reservation protocol (RSVP) path message, which may also contain quality of service (QoS) and reverse charging extension objects. IP routers forward the path message through an IP network, without modifying the objects, to a second IWF device, which retrieves the ATM address of the first IWF device. The second IWF device initiates an ATM setup message, including a responsive RSVP reservation request message. The setup message is sent through the ATM network to the first IWF device, which establishes the SVC with the second IWF device, according to the QoS parameter.",

        "3. Background and Material Information",
        "With the development of various communications applications for use over packet switched data networks, such as the Internet, demands for predictable bandwidth and delay support are increasing. For example, services including voiceover-Internet and real-time audio, audio-visual and white-board conferencing, require the packets of transmitted data to arrive at a destination terminal with minimal delay and in a presentable order.",
        "Packet switched data networks generally support \u201cbest effort\u201d routing of data. The packets of information sent from an originating end-system, such as an Internet subscriber, to a destination end-system, such as an Internet service provider (ISP), are transmitted through a network of interconnected routers using Internet protocol (IP). The IP network essentially divides the transmitted data into packets, each of which travels to the destination end-system through a uniquely determined path among the available routers. The flow of a packet from one router to the next router in the IP network is called a \u201chop.\u201d The destination end-system ultimately receives the packets and assembles them in the appropriate order to present the transmitted information.",
        "Best effort routing is very flexible in that the data packets travel through any available combination of routers to ultimately reach the destination end-system. When a router becomes unavailable, for example, due to traffic congestion causing its queue threshold to be exceeded, the data packets simply proceed through a different path. A disadvantage of best effort routing is that the speed and quality of the IP traffic is inconsistent due to packets being delayed, lost and received out of order. In typical data transfer scenarios, this disadvantage may be insignificant, especially when additional protocols, such as transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP) and user datagram protocol/Internet protocol (UDP/IP), are implemented to resend and otherwise minimize the effect of lost and delayed data packets. However, many evolving applications depend on consistent and reliable data packet routing, such as those applications involving real-time streaming of audio and/or visual data.",
        "The network criteria, such as bandwidth, needed for the IP network to support these applications are set forth in the quality of service (QoS) parameters. Generally, best effort routing cannot guarantee a particular QoS, especially when a large bandwidth is needed. Differential services may be available in some IP networks. Differential services push aside lower priority traffic to accommodate a predetermined QoS for transmissions of select subscribers, based on a preferred differential level indicator in the data packet headers. However, differential services do not guarantee the desired level of service.",
        "An IP network may also be implemented in conjunction with a non-broadcasting multiple access (NBMA) switched network, such as an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network, which is able to set aside communication paths that meet the predefined traffic requirements of the specific applications. For example, an ATM network may set up and tear down a switched virtual circuit (SVC) of a specified bandwidth in response to dynamic communication demands on a per connection basis. The IP network interfaces with a switched network according to various mutually recognized protocols, such as resource reservation protocol (RSVP) and next hop resolution protocol (NHRP). Because the switched network is typically able to isolate or reserve a particular route for the duration of a connection, the required QoS may be established upon connection to the network, accommodating predetermined parameters such as delay, delay jitter and error rate, as well as the demands of the application and the state of the network at the time of connection.",
        "RSVP is a network control protocol that enables QoS connections to be established and maintained by dynamically allocating bandwidth. RSVP is receiver initiated in that the destination end-system initiates the actual reservation of resources or routing elements that enable the connection. When the IP network is implemented over an ATM network, the IP addresses of the routing elements are translated into ATM addresses by a central server or database. The flow may then pass through the switched network by setting up virtual circuits among ATM switches.",
        "NHRP is an address resolution protocol that enables an IP end-system to interface with a switching network, such as an ATM network, and connect with another IP end-system. Use of NHRP extends address resolution between networks across IP subnets. An originating end-system requests a connection through routers in an IP network to a desired destination end-system. A next hop server (NHS) maps the IP address of the destination end-system to its associated ATM address using mapping data and directs the routers to the next hop router in the IP network, until the connection request reaches the destination end-system. Generally, NHRP is not capable of supporting multicast communications.",
        "Although conventional RSVP and NHRP generally enable IP connections over switched networks, they are relatively cumbersome to implement. Both protocols require accessing a central mapping server or database, such as an address resolution protocol (ARP) server or an NBMA-IP server, to associate IP addresses with the corresponding NBMA switched network addresses, and to otherwise control the routing. Each device must register its IP address and NBMA address in the server, which resolves the IP addresses to the registered ATM addresses in response to connection requests. Furthermore, RSVP and NHRP do not accommodate simultaneous, point-to-multipoint (i.e., multicast) transmissions. Also, RSVP has limited scalability due to extension state information and constant refreshment, and many conventional end-systems are not RSVP capable.",
        "The present invention overcomes the problems associated with the prior art, as described below.",

        "The present invention relates to enhancing RSVP to efficiently establish dynamic short-cut IP connections through an associated switched network. The enhancements include adding an extension object to the RSVP messaging that identifies a switched network address of an originating interworking function device located in the IP network and the switched network, without accessing a mapping database, server or the like. The system is very scalable with a large number of subscribers and incurs minimum administrative and operational overhead.",
        "In view of the above, the present invention through one or more of its various aspects and/or embodiments is presented to accomplish one or more objectives and advantages, such as those noted below.",
        "An aspect of the present invention provides a method for implementing an Internet protocol (IP) connection between a first bridging device and a second bridging device through a switched transport network. The first bridging device and the second bridging device are connectable to the switched transport network and an IP network. The method includes inserting a switched transport network address of the first bridging device into an extension object of a resource reservation protocol (RSVP) path message and forwarding the path message to the second bridging device, through at least one router in the IP network. The router passes the path message without modifying the RSVP extension object. The path message may be forwarded by default routing. A setup message is forwarded to the first bridging device, through at least one switching device in the switched transport network, based on the first bridging device address retrieved by the second bridging device from the RSVP extension object.",
        "The connection is established between the first bridging device and the second bridging device through the switching network in response to the setup message. The switched transport network may be an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network or a multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) network. When it is an ATM network, the IP connection is a switched virtual circuit (SVC).",
        "The path message may be captured at the second bridging device and the address of the first bridging device from the RSVP extension object may be stored in association with an address of the originating host device. The stored address is retrieved based on the address of the originating host device, included in the responsive reservation request message. The setup message is then forwarded to the first bridging device based on the retrieved address.",
        "At least one quality of service (QoS) connection parameter may be included in a second RSVP extension object of the RSVP path message. The second RSVP extension object is included in an RSVP reservation request message, generated by the destination host device in response to the path message, the destination host device receiving the path message from the second bridging device. The connection is then established in accordance with the at least one quality of service connection parameter. The QoS connection parameter may be a bidirectional flow specification, such as a bandwidth requirement.",
        "Reverse charge indication data may be included in a third RSVP extension object of the RSVP path message received from the originating host device. It is determined whether the reverse charge indication data requires the originating host device to be charged for the connection. Accounting data relating to the connection is associated with the originating host device when the reverse charge indication data requires the originating host device to be charged. The accounting data is associated with the destination host device when the reverse charge indication data does not require the originating host device to be charged.",
        "Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for providing an IP session, over an SVC, between an originating end-system and a destination end-system through an originating interworking function device (IWF) and a destination IWF device, which are connectable to an ATM network and an IP network. An RSVP path message is received from the originating end-system at the originating IWF device. The path message includes at least one parameter defining a predetermined bidirectional flow requirement. An ATM address of the IWF device is inserted into a transport network hop (THOP) object of the path message. The path message is forwarded through the IP network by default routing to a destination IWF device, without modifying the THOP object. The default routing may be best effort routing among IP routers. The THOP object is cached in association with an IP address of the originating end-system at the destination IWF device and forwarded to the destination end-system.",
        "A responsive RSVP reservation request message is received from the destination end-system at the destination IWF device directed to the originating end-system, the reservation request message including the bidirectional flow parameter. A setup message is launched through the ATM network based on the associated THOP object and the IP address of the originating end-system, the setup message including the reservation request message. Launching the setup message may include sending a user-to-network interface (UNI) protocol setup message to an ATM edge switch in the ATM network. The setup message is received at the originating IWF device and the SVC connection is established between the originating IWF device and the destination IWF device according to the bidirectional flow parameter. The reservation request message is forwarded to the originating end-system and the IP session between the originating end-system and the destination end-system is shifted to the SVC connection.",
        "The path message may further include a reverse charge indicator. The destination IWF device determines whether the reverse charge indicator is active. When the reverse charge indicator is active, billing data for the SVC connection is associated with the originating end-system. When the reverse charge indicator is not active, the billing data is associated with the destination end-system.",
        "Another aspect of the present invention provides computer data signaling, embodied on a propagation medium, that enables an IP connection across a switched transport network, between an originating host device and a destination host device, through a first bridging device and a second bridging device. The computer data signaling includes a first path message signal, a second path message signal, a reservation request message signal, a fist setup signal and a second setup signal. The first path message signal, which includes an address parameter for the first bridging device and an IP address of the originating host device, is received from the originating host device. The second path message signal, which includes a switched transport network address of the first bridging device in the address parameter and the IP address of the originating host device, is forwarded through an IP network without modification to the address parameter. The reservation request message signal message signal, which includes the IP address of the originating host device, is received from the destination host device in response to the second path message. The first setup message signal, which includes the reservation request message signal retrieved from the second path message signal, is forwarded through the switched transport network to the transport network address of the first bridging device. The second setup message, which includes the reservation request message signal, is forwarded to the IP address of the originating host device. The IP connection is established in response to the second setup message signal.",
        "The first path message signal, the second path message signal and the reservation request message signal may further include a bidirectional flow parameter that defines at least one QoS attribute of the IP connection. The IP connection is established in accordance with the QoS attribute. The QoS attribute may include a bandwidth. The first path message signal, the second path message signal and the reservation request message signal may further include a reverse charging parameter. Accounting data for the IP connection is associated with the originating host device when the reverse charging parameter is activated. The accounting data is associated with the destination host device when the reverse charging parameter is not activated. The first path message signal, the second path message signal and the reservation request message signal may comply with RSVP. The first setup message signal and the second setup message signal may comply with UNI protocol.",
        "The switched data transport network may be ATM network. When it is an ATM network, the address parameter for the first bridging device is an ATM transport network hop (THOP) RSVP extension object. The switched data transport network may be an MPLS network. When it is an MPLS network, the address parameter for the first bridging device may be either an IPv4 RSVP extension object or an IPv6 RSVP extension object.",
        "Yet another aspect of the present invention provides a system for establishing a short-cut IP connection through a switched transport network, which includes a fist bridging device and a second bridging device. The first bridging device inserts its switched transport network address into an address extension object of a RSVP path message, received from an originating host device, and forwards the path message through at least one router in an IP network by default routing. The router passes the path message without modifying the address extension object.",
        "The second bridging device receives the path message and forwards a setup message to the first bridging device through at least one switching device in the switched transport network, based on the first bridging device address retrieved from the address extension object. The setup message includes an RSVP reservation request message generated by a destination host device in response to the path message. The short-cut IP connection is established between the first bridging device and the second bridging device through the switching network in response to the setup message. The switched transport network may be an ATM network and the short-cut IP connection may an SVC connection. The short-cut IP connection is then established in accordance with a QoS connection parameter that may be included in a bidirectional flow specification extension object of the path message.",
        "The second bridging device may capture the path message and store the switched network address of the first bridging device, retrieved from the address extension object, in association with an IP address of the originating host device. The stored address of the first bridging device is retrieved based on the IP address of the originating host device included in the responsive reservation request message. The setup message is forwarded to the first bridging device based on the retrieved address. Also, the first bridging device may forward the reservation request message to the originating host device, establishing an IP connection between the originating host device and the destination host device over the short-cut IP connection, in place of an IP connection over the IP network.",
        "The various aspects and embodiments of the present invention are described in detail below.",
        "FIG. 1 is a diagram depicting an exemplary network infrastructure supporting the present invention. As stated above, the enhancements to RSVP enable short-cut IP connections to be established over switched networks. FIG. 1, in particular, depicts an exemplary ATM network 8 through which the short-cut IP connection may be established, operating in conjunction with the IP network 6. The present invention is not limited to ATM networks. The invention may be implemented over any RSVP capable switched network that interfaces with the IP network 6, including, for example, a multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) network. For example, in alternative embodiments, the switching network includes MPLS routers, optical switching devices controlled by generalized MPLS (GMPLS), or time division multiplex (TDM) switching devices controlled by GMPLS. The associated connection setup requests would be in accordance with RSVP-te or constraint-based routed label distribution protocol (CR-LDP).",
        "The ATM network 8 includes ATM edge switch 22 and ATM edge switch 24. Although not pictured, the ATM network 8 may further include multiple ATM core switches situated between the edge switches without affecting implementation of the present invention. The IP network 6 is depicted to include IP router 14 and IP router 16. The IP network 6 may likewise include any number of intervening IP routers to enable best effort routing of IP traffic. The ATM network 8 and the IP network 6 share bridging devices to interface between the networks. In particular, both networks include an interworking function (IWF) device 12, through which the originating end-system 10 accesses the networks, and an IWF device 18, through which the destination end-system 20 accesses the networks. The IWF devices 10 and 18 may be multiple devices or any combination of hardware and software that translate between RSVP of the IP network 6 and user-to-network interface (UNI), or other signaling, of the ATM network 8. For example, the IWF device 12 may be a digital subscriber line (DSL) modem and the IWF device 18 may be an SVC router. The ATM network 8 uses a signaling protocol to allocate network resources and to establish SVCs, which are dynamically set up and removed according to need (as opposed to permanently configured PVCs).",
        "Each of the IWF devices 12 and 18 include two physical ports. One port interfaces with the local area network (LAN), through which they respectively communicate with the originating IP end-system 10 and the destination IP end-system 20. The other physical port interfaces with a wide area network (WAN), such as the ATM network 8. The WAN port includes multiple logical ports, depending on the number of sessions to be established through the WAN.",
        "In an embodiment of the invention, the originating end-system 10 and the destination end-system 20 are RSVP capable IP devices. The end-systems may include, for example, individual personal computers or workstations, enterprise networks, ISPs and peer networks. A typical implementation is the originating end-system 10 being an Internet service subscriber and the destination end-system 20 being an ISP. The originating end-system 10 maintains its own IP address, domain naming system (DNS) and other IP configurations. The DNS translates the name of the originating end-system 10 into an IP address or a universal resource locator (URL).",
        "In an alternative embodiment, an example of which is shown in FIG. 4, one or both end-systems are not RSVP capable, in which case a proxy must be incorporated to enable the RSVP communications. A proxy is a device, other than an end-system, that provides appropriate signaling on behalf of the end-systems for communications to be established. An advantage of using a proxy is that the invention may be implemented in existing networks without modifying every IP device to accommodate RSVP signaling. For example, when the destination end-system 20 is not RSVP capable, it connects to a proxy server 30, as shown in FIG. 4. The proxy server 30 then initiates the RSVP messaging to enable the short-cut IP connection over the ATM network 8, or other transport networks, as described in detail below.",
        "As stated above, the originating end-system 10 that desires a short-cut IP connection through the ATM network 8 conventionally establishes an IP session with the destination end-system 20, using best effort routing based on TCP/IP and UDP/IP, for example, and the IP addresses of the two end-systems. The short-cut will be set up using RSVP, which reserves a communications route between the end-systems based on RSVP messages passed through the IP network 6 and ultimately the ATM network 8. The basic RSVP message types include path (PATH) messages, reservation request (RESV) messages, path tear down (PATHTEAR) messages, reservation tear down (RESVTEAR) messages and reservation confirmation (RESVCONF) messages.",
        "Generally, the conventional PATH messages defines the communication path by traveling downstream through the IP network from the originating end-system 10 to the destination end system 20, following the same best effort route as the data packets in the IP session. Typically, a PATH message causes each router to store the IP address of the previous router to enable a corresponding RESV message to travel upstream along the same route, in the reverse direction.",
        "The PATH message reaches the destination end-system 20, which generates and sends the corresponding RESV message. Each router sequentially receives the RESV message, which includes information regarding the functionality of the previous router, and accepts or rejects the reservation. When a reservation is accepted, the router sends an RESV message to the next router on the path. When the RESV message reaches the originating end-system, the reservation is established through the IP network between the two end-systems. When the end-system 20, which initiates the RESV message, requests confirmation through the RESV message, an RESVCONF message is returned to confirm the reservation. The end-systems may terminate the path by sending a PATHTEAR message, which flows in the same direction as the PATH message, or an RESVTEAR message, which flows in the same direction as the RESV message.",
        "The RSVP messages include various objects defining parameters of the requested connection. Examples of conventional RSVP objects include the FLOWSPEC object, the SENDER_TEMPLATE object and the SESSION object. The FLOWSPEC object describes the specifications of the traffic stream sent from the originating end-system 10, including the required QoS of the desired connection, and the service requirements of the application. The SENDER_TEMPLATE object provides the source IP address and the source port number, which correspond to the originating end-system 10. The SESSION object provides the destination IP address and the destination port number, which correspond to the destination end-system 20.",
        "Conventionally, the switched network includes a server, e.g., an ARP server, accessible by the IWF devices 12 and 18 to associate the IP addresses of the end-systems 10 and 20 and the IWF devices 12 and 18 with the respective switched network (e.g., ATM network) addresses, enabling translation of the IP address to the ATM address. For example, an ARP server may perform the IP to ATM address translation for end-systems and routers within a local IP subnet (LIS). The present invention eliminates the need for the server based on enhancements to RSVP.",
        "In particular, an RSVP extension that defines a transport network hop (THOP) is included in the RSVP messaging. THOP may include up to three additional classes of objects: RSVP_THOP, RSVP_CYSPEC and RSVP_SVCSPEC. In an embodiment of the invention, the RSVP_THOP class includes three objects, each of which may only be included in the RSVP PATH message as it traverses the IP network between the originating end-system 10 and the destination end-system 20. The objects follow the format described, for example, in Request for Comment (RFC) 2205, \u201cResource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)\u2014Version 1 Functional Specification,\u201d the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The class number should be at least 192 (e.g., 11bbbbbb, where 1 is a mandatory bit and b is optional) to assure proper routing.",
        "Each of the objects represent the address of the previous hop located in a switched network, e.g., the ATM network 8 or an MPLS network. The first two objects of the RSVP_THOP class represent addresses in an MPLS network. For example, the first object is the IPv4 RSVP_THOP object, which represents the IP address of the previous hop in an MPLS network using the IPv4 protocol. The object contains 4 octets to accommodate the 32 bit address field associated with conventional IP addresses. The second object is the IPv6 RSVP_THOP object, which represents the IP address of the previous hop in an MPLS network using the IPv6 protocol. The object contains 16 octets to accommodate the expanded 128 bit address field. The IPv6 protocol enables additional features of the MPLS network, including enhanced security and multicasting, for example. The third object is the ATM RSVP_THOP object, which represents the address of the previous hop located in the ATM network 8. The object may contain 20 octets to accommodate network service access point (NSAP) addressing.",
        "Each of the objects in the RSVP_THOP class essentially function in the same manner with respect to representing transport network addresses of MPLS or ATM switching devices, according to the alternative embodiments of invention. Therefore, the implementation of the ATM RSVP_THOP object in an ATM network, as described below, is equally applicable to the IPv4 and IPv6 RSVP_THOP objects in an MPLS network.",
        "The ATM RSVP_THOP object carries the ATM transport network address of the originating interface or bridging device, such as the IWF device 12, through which the PATH message was most recently sent. Only nodes or routers that interface with both the initial transport network (e.g., the IP network 6) and a different, switched transport network (e.g., the ATM network 8) respond to the ATM RSVP_THOP object. For example, the IWF device 12 inserts its ATM address into the ATM RSVP_THOP object and the IWF device 18 retrieves the address, while all other IP devices, such as the IP network routers 14 and 16, pass the ATM RSVP_THOP object without modification. Multiple ATM RSVP_THOP objects may be included in the same PATH message to accommodate interim IWF devices. The order of the multiple objects is last-in-first-out (LIFO).",
        "The RSVP_CYSPEC class has a class number different from the RSVP_THOP class and includes one object, for example, which may be included in the RSVP PATH and RESV messages. The object is the RSVP_CYSPEC object, which represents bidirectional flow specifications. The object includes a TSPEC field and an RSPEC field, each of which includes RSVP FLOWSPEC data without the header, e.g., as described in RFC 2210, \u201cThe Use of RSVP with IETF Integrated Services,\u201d the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The TSPEC field describes the sending flow specifications (e.g., the ingress QoS) and the RSPEC field describes the receiving flow specifications (e.g., the egress QoS). Accordingly, the RSVP_CYSPEC object is able to describe the QoS which the short-cut IP connection must support.",
        "The RSVP_SVCSPEC class has another class number, different from the RSVP_CYSPEC and RSVP_THOP classes, and includes one object, which may be contained in the RSVP PATH and RESV messages. The object is the RSVP_SVCSPEC object, which represents the service specifications and supports value-added RSVP service signaling among the IP devices. The object includes a reverse charge indicator field to indicate whether the RSVP PATH message sender, e.g., the originating end-system 10, is to pay for the connection. The reverse billing enabled by the RSVP_SVCSPEC object is necessary because the switched network through which the IP short-cut connection is established treats the RSVP PATH message receiver, e.g., the destination end-system 18, as the calling party even though the connection is initiated by the originating end-system 10. The reverse billing enables accounting data to be associated with the originating end-system 10, which may then be billed for the connection, when appropriate.",
        "Accordingly, the reverse charge indicator of the RSVP_SVCSPEC object contains a Boolean value. A value of 1 (TRUE) indicates that the called party, e.g., the originating end-system 10, is to be billed. A value of 0 (FALSE) indicates the called party not be billed. In other words, the calling party, e.g., the destination end-system 20, is billed or the call is toll free. The destination IWF device 18 sets the reverse charge indicator in the switched network call setup message when the RSVP_SVCSPEC object indicates a value of 1. When the switching network UNI signaling does not support reverse charging, the interworking device rejects the RSVP message and generates a corresponding error message.",
        "FIGS. 2 and 3 are flow diagrams illustrating an exemplary RSVP-based guaranteed QoS IP connection over the ATM network 8. FIG. 2 depicts an RSVP path procedure initiated by the originating end-system 10. In particular, the originating end-system 10, or the initiating host, desiring the IP short-cut connection through the ATM network 8 conventionally establishes a default IP connection with the destination end-system 20 using best effort routing, e.g., TCP/IP or UDP/IP, and the IP addresses of the two end-systems. An RSVP session may be initiated using RSVP with minor extension. When the originating end-system 10 requests a short-cut connection over the ATM network 8, e.g., as a result of specific QoS session requirements, the connection may be dynamically established between the bridging devices, IWF device 12 and IWF device 18, each of which is capable of translating between RSVP and UNI protocol signaling. The general connection setup protocol between the IWF devices and the ATM network 8 may be UNI signaling with confirmation procedure, such as ATM UNI Specification\u2014version 3.1 or version 4.0.",
        "To establish the short-cut IP connection, the originating end-system 10 generates and sends an RSVP PATH message to the IWF device 12 at step 220 of FIG. 2. The connection between the originating end-system 10 and the IWF device 12 is established through regular IP connectivity, such as IP over Ethernet. According to the invention, the PATH message includes the QoS specifications for the desired connection, such as the bidirectional QoS specification object RSVP_CYSPEC, which describes the ingress QoS and the egress QoS. The RSVP_CYSPEC object is associated with, and may replace, standard routing RSVP objects, such as the RSVP SENDER_TEMPLATE object, which provides the IP address and the port number of the originating end-system 10, and the RSVP SESSION object, which provides the IP address and the port number of the destination end-system 20.",
        "At step 222, the originating IWF device 12 captures the PATH message and inserts its ATM address, e.g., the ATM network service access point (NSAP) address, into the PATH message as the ATM RSVP-THOP object, discussed above. The IWF device 12 also caches the PATH message for comparison to the returned RESV message, discussed below. The PATH message travels downstream from the IWF device 12 to the destination IWF device 18, following the same route as the regular data packets. In particular, the IWF device 12 forwards the PATH message, including the ATM RSVP_THOP object, to the IP router 14 at step 224, which routes the PATH message to the IP router 16 at step 226. The IP router 16 then routes the PATH message to the destination IWF device 18 at step 228. Significantly, even though the default connection routers, e.g., the IP router 14 and the IP router 16, typically modify the previous hop address passed in the PATH message, they do not modify the ATM RSVP_THOP object.",
        "In the depicted embodiment of the invention, the IP transport network 6 carrying the default connection is separate from the ATM network 8, which includes the ATM edge switches 22 and 24. However, alternative embodiments include the default IP connection being carried by the same ATM network through which the short-cut is ultimately established.",
        "At step 230, the IWF device 18 captures the PATH message and caches the mapping of the IP address of the originating end-system 10 to the address in the ATM RSVP_THOP object and forwards the PATH message to the destination end-system 20. The destination end-system 20 receives and validates the PATH message. In an embodiment of the invention, the IWF device 18 removes the ATM RSVP_THOP object before passing the PATH message to the destination end-system 20. Removing the object avoids the possibility of the destination end-system 20 not recognizing the ATM RSVP_THOP object and rejecting the connection.",
        "FIG. 3 is a flow diagram depicting the RSVP reserve messaging (RESV) sent through the ATM network 8 in response to the received RSVP PATH message. The destination end-system 20 generates and sends an RSVP RESV message to the IWF device 18 at step 340. Like the PATH message, the RESV message may contain an RSVP_CYSPEC extension object, confirming bidirectional traffic characteristics of the QoS IP flow, instead of the RSVP_FLOWSPEC object. When the RESV message does not contain the RSVP_CYSPEC object, the upstream traffic characteristics of the bidirectional shortcut are handled according to local protocol. In an embodiment of the invention, the upstream QoS may be algorithmically calculated from the RSVP_FLOWSPEC object. The RESV message may further contain the RSVP_SVCSPEC object to enable reverse billing, when necessary.",
        "The IWF device 18 initially captures the RESV message at step 342. To establish an ATM SVC at the requested QoS through broadband access lines, such as DSL, Ethernet or TDM, the IWF device 18 launches a call setup message, e.g., an ATM UNI signaling protocol SETUP message, to the longest short-cut bridging device address indicated by the previously cached ATM RSVP_THOP object. In the present example, the longest short-cut bridging device address is the ATM address of the IWF device 12. In other words, had the PATH message passed through intermediate IWF devices, which had respectively inserted additional ATM RSVP_THOP objects, the SETUP message would be directed to the address/contained in the first inserted ATM RSVP_THOP object, i.e., the originating IWF device 12. The UNI signaling enables the transfer of information across the ATM network 8. For example, the user-to-user information element (UU IE) of the UNI SETUP message may contain the RSVP RESV message to be sent across the ATM network 8 to the IWF device 12. The assignment of the RESV message in UU IE follows routing protocol criteria RFC 3033, \u201cThe Assignment of the Information Field and Protocol Identifier in the Q.2941 Generic Identifier and the Q.2957 User-to-User Signaling for the Internet Protocol,\u201d the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.",
        "The IWF device 18 initially sends the SETUP message, along with the RESV message, to the ATM edge switch 24 at step 344. The ATM edge switch 24 confirms receipt of the SETUP message and forwards the message to the ATM edge switch 22 at step 348. The message may also pass through intervening ATM core switches in the ATM network 8 (not pictured), using private network-to-network interface (PNNI) signaling protocol, for example. The ATM edge switch 22 forwards the SETUP message to the IWF device 12 at step 350.",
        "The IWF device 12 validates the UNI SETUP and the RESV messages with the cached PATH message at step 351. Also, to confirm the connection across the ATM network 8, the IWF device 12 sends a CONN message to the ATM edge switch 22 at step 352, which acknowledges the confirmation signal by returning a CONN ACK message to the IWF device 12 at step 354. Likewise, the ATM edge switch 22 sends a CONN message to the ATM edge switch 24 at step 356, which returns a CONN ACK message at step 358. The ATM edge switch 24 sends a CONN message to the IWF device 18 at step 360, which returns a CONN ACK message at step 362, completing the connection confirmation cycle.",
        "Meanwhile, after the originating IWF device 12 validates the UNI SETUP message and the RSVP RESV message, an ATM SVC at the requested QoS is setup between the originating IWF device 12 and the destination IWF device 18 through broadband access lines, as indicated by step 364. The SVC provides a short-cut between the IWF devices by bypassing the IP network 6. The IWF device 18 accordingly creates an entry in its forwarding table indicating the successful setup of the ATM SVC, an example of which is shown in Table 1.",

Therefore, as indicated by the first row of Table 1, when the destination IP data received at the IWF device 18 indicates any local or private IP address, the IWF device 18 directs the associated connection through the LAN interface. The asterisks in the first row indicate that the source IP address and the port information does not affect the forward to interface when the destination IP data indicates a local or private IP address.",
        "As indicated by the second row of Table 1, when data is received at the TCP/UDP port and provides that the destination IP address is the originating end-system 10 and the source IP address is the destination end-system 20, the output of the IWF device 18 directs the connection over the new short-cut SVC through the WAN interface, identified by an associated virtual path indicator (VPI) and virtual channel indicator (VCI). As indicated by the asterisks in the third row of Table 1, incoming data directed to a port other than the TCP/UDP port, or indicating destination and source IP addresses other than the originating end-system 10 and the destination end-system 20, respectively, invoke the default ATM connection of the WAN interface.",

The short-cut IP connection is based on RFC 1483, \u201cMultiprotocol Encapsulation Over ATM Adaptation Layer 5\u201d the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. After the short-cut is established and available at step 372, the QoS IP session is moved from the IP network 6 to the new SVC based QoS short-cut in the ATM network. In other words, the IP traffic travels the dedicated QoS short-cut path between the originating end-system 10 and the destination end-system 20 through the ATM switches 22 and 24, as opposed to the hop-by-hop default IP path through the IP routers 14 and 16.",
        "Typically, the SVC is torn down through ATM UNI signaling. Furthermore, the soft state natural of the RSVP 2205 protocol is maintained at the IP devices, including the IWF devices 12 and 18, to avoid an orphaned QoS shortcut when the IP session is disconnected by default. Substantial losses of RSVP refreshment messages will cause the QoS short-cut to automatically tear-down through the UNI signaling. Also, either the originating end-system 10 or the destination end-system 20 may cause the SVC to be torn down by sending an RSVP PATHTEAR or RESVTEAR message, respectively. The IWF devices 12 and 18 respond by tearing down the ATM SVC, along with the RSVP session.",
        "The traffic characteristics of the QoS short-cut are constructed from RSVP traffic characteristics objects according to RFC 2210, \u201cThe Use of RSVP with IETF Integrated Services;\u201d RFC 2211, \u201cSpecification of the Controlled-Load Network Element Service;\u201d and RFC 2212, \u201cSpecification of Guaranteed Quality of Service,\u201d the disclosures of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

        "The present invention further enables multiple simultaneous IP short-cut connections among multiple endpoints. Each IP connection is a point-to-point connection with a unique set of connection parameters, including a source address, source port number, destination address and destination port number, suitable for IP virtual private network (VPN) service with specific QoS requirements. At least one of the four parameters must be different in order to enable a simultaneous IP short-cut connection. For example, different addresses for the destination end-systems, as well as different port assignment for each connection, enable the simultaneous IP short-cut connections from the originating end-system 10.",
        "Setting up each of the additional simultaneous connections involves essentially the same processing steps described above. Generally, the originating IWF device 12 captures the PATH message from the originating end-system 10, including the ATM RSVP_THOP object, and inserts its ATM address as the ATM RSVP_THOP object. The IP routers forward the PATH message to an appropriate destination IWF device (which may be different from the destination IWF device 18) without altering the ATM RSVP_THOP. The destination IWF device forwards the PATH message to a second destination end-system, which receives and validates the PATH message.",
        "The second destination end-system then generates and sends a corresponding RSVP RESV message. A UNI SETUP message, containing the RSVP RESV message, is routed by the destination IWF device through the ATM network 8 to the originating IWF device 12 based on the ATM address previously inserted as the ATM RSVP_THOP object. A second ATM SVC connection is established between the originating IWF device 12 and the destination IWF device at the requested QoS. As stated above, to enable the second ATM SVC connection, there must be at least one connection parameter (e.g., the source address, the source port number, the destination address and/or the destination parameter) that is different from the corresponding connection parameter associated with the first ATM SVC connection. The originating IWF device 12 forwards the RSVP RESV message to the originating end-system 10 to complete the ATM SVC between the originating end-system 10 and the second destination end-system.",
        "The present invention also enables the originating end-system 10 to be temporarily assigned alternate IP addresses, associated with a particular destination address. For example, when the originating end-system 10 has a public IP address, and the user wishes to access a private or secure network, the destination end-system within the desired network must generate an alternate IP address to enable the session. For generating a temporary IP address, the process is essentially the same as described above with respect to FIGS. 2 and 3, with the addition of a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) extension object in the RSVP messaging. The DHCP extension object enables a TCP/IP host, e.g., the originating end-system 10, to receive temporary (as well as permanent) IP addresses from centrally administered servers, for example, at the direction of the destination end-system 20.",

        "As discussed above with respect to Table 1, the first three columns of Table 5 indicate the incoming interface of the IWF device 18 and the last column indicates the outgoing interface of the IWF device 18. Therefore, as indicated by the first row, when the destination IP data received at the IWF device 18 indicates any local or private IP address, the IWF device 18 directs the associated connection through the LAN interface. The asterisks in the first row indicate that the source IP address and port information do not affect the forward to interface when the destination IP data indicates a local or private IP address.",
        "As indicated by the second row of Table 5, when data is received at the TCP/UDP port and provides that the destination IP address is the destination end-system 20 and the source IP address is the originating end-system 10, the IWF device 18 directs the connection to the new short-cut SVC through the WAN interface, identified by an associated VPI and VCI. As indicated by the asterisks in the third row of Table 5, incoming data directed to a port other than the TCP/UDP port, or indicating destination and source IP addresses other than the destination end-system 20 and the originating end-system 20, respectively, invokes the default ATM connection of the WAN interface.",
        "Similarly, the IWF device 12 creates an entry in its forwarding table indicating the successful set up of the ATM SVC, an example of which is shown in Table 6.",
        "TABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForward to\n\n\nDestination IP\nSource IP\nPort\nInterface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny local or\n*\n*\nLAN\n\n\nprivate address\n\n\noriginating end-\ndestination\nTCP/UDP\nWAN\u2014new QoS\n\n\nsystem 10\nend-system 20\nport\nSVC\n\n\n*\n*\n*\nWAN\u2014default\n\n\n\n\n\nATM connection",
        "The IWF device 18 also forwards the RESV message to the proxy server 30 at step 652. The proxy server accepts the RESV message on behalf of the destination end-system 20 at step 654. A short-cut IP connection at the requested QoS is then available over the newly established SVC between the IWF device 12 and the IWF device 18, enabling communication between the originating end-system 10 and the destination end-system 20, indicated at step 656. After the shortcut is established and available at step 656, the QoS IP session is moved from the IP network 6 to the new SVC based QoS short-cut in the ATM network. In other words, as in the embodiment involving an RSVP capable destination end-system 20, the IP traffic travels the dedicated QoS short-cut path between the originating end-system 10 and the destination end-system 20 through the ATM switches 22 and 24, as opposed to the hop-by-hop default IP path through the IP routers 14 and 16.",
        "Although the invention has been described with reference to several exemplary embodiments, it is understood that the words that have been used are words of description and illustration, rather than words of limitation. Changes may be made within the purview of the appended claims, as presently stated and as amended, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention in its aspects.
