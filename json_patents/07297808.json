        "The present invention relates to new statin derivatives. More particularly, the present invention relates to statin nitroderivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as cholesterol-reducing drugs, as drugs having immunosuppressive properties, antioxidant, antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory activity, effects on endothelial function, and for treating and/or preventing acute coronary syndromes, stroke, neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease as well as autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.",
        "With statins a class of compounds is intended, comprising as main components lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, mevastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and cerivastatin (rivastatin). They possess a side group that is structurally similar to HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A). Fluvastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and cerivastatin are entirely synthetic compounds containing a heptanoic acid side chain, the remainders being fungal metabolites.",
        "It is known that the various statins are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme which catalyses an early, rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, reduce triglyceride levels and are also indicated for raising HDL-C levels (P. O. Bonetti et al., European Heart Journal (2003) 24, 225-248).",
        "However, it is also known that statins exhibit adverse effects, such as for example hepatopathy, possible carcinogenic potential, muscular side-effects and, above all, myopathy.",
        "It was now object of the present invention to provide new derivatives of statins able not only to eliminate or at least reduce the side effects associated with these compounds, but also having an improved pharmacological activity. It has been so surprisingly found that statin nitroderivatives have a significantly improved overall profile as compared to native statins both in term of wider pharmacological activity and enhanced tolerability. In particular, it has been recognized that the statin nitroderivatives of the present invention exhibit a strong anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and antiplatelet activity and can be furthermore employed for reducing cholesterol and triglycerides levels, for raising HDL-C levels and for treating or preventing acute coronary syndromes, stroke, peripheral vascular diseases such as peripheral ischemia and all disorders associated with endothelial dysfunctions such as vascular complications in diabetic patients and atherosclerosis. They should also be employed for treating neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease as well as multiple sclerosis.",

Moreover, they can be effective also in the other pathologies such as acute coronary syndromes, stroke, peripheral vascular diseases such as peripheral ischemia, all disorders associated with endothelial dysfunctions such as vascular complications in diabetic patients and atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis.",
        "Study on Vascular Tone",
        "The ability of statin nitroderivatives to induce vasorelaxation in comparison to native statins, was tested in vitro in isolated rabbit thoracic aorta preparations (Wanstall J. C. et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 134:463-472, 2001). Male New Zealand rabbits were anaesthetized with thiopental-Na (50 mg/kg, iv), sacrificed by exsanguinations and then the thorax was opened and the aorta dissected. Single ring preparations (4 mm in length) of thoracic aorta were set up in physiological salt solution (PSS) at 37\u00b0 C. in small organ chambers (5 ml). The composition of PSS was (mM): NaCl 130, NaHCO3 14.9, KH2PO4 1.2, MgSO4 1.2, HEPES 10, CaCl2, ascorbic acid 170 and glucose 1.1 (95% O2/5% CO2; pH 7.4). Each ring was mounted under 2 g passive tension in 5 ml organ bath. Isometric tension was recorded with a Grass transducer (Grass FT03) attached to a BIOPAC MP150 System. Preparations were allowed to equilibrate for 1 h, then contracted submaximally with noradrenaline (NA, 1 \u03bcM) and, when the contraction was stable, acetylcholine (ACh, 10 \u03bcM) was added. A relaxant response to ACh indicated the presence of a functional endothelium. When a stable precontraction was reached, a cumulative concentration-response curve to either of the vasorelaxant agents was obtained in the presence of a functional endothelium. Time intervals between different concentrations were based on the time needed to reach a full response. Moreover, the effect of the soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ (1-H-(1,2,4)-oxadiazol(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one) on the dilator responses elicited by the compounds was examined preincubating the aortic rings with ODQ (10 \u03bcM) for 20 min. Responses to vasorelaxing agents were measured from the plateau of NA contraction. The IC50 (concentration giving 50% reversal of NA contraction) was interpolated from the plots of relaxant-response vs log molar concentration of tested compound.",
        "During the experimental period, the plateau obtained with NA was stable without significant spontaneous loss of contraction in the aortic rings. Under these experimental conditions, native statins did not produce relaxation up to 30 \u03bcM, the curve being not different from that built up in presence of vehicle alone.",
        "As shown in the following Table 1, the nitroderivatives of the invention were able to induce relaxation in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, in experiments performed in presence of ODQ (10 \u03bcM), the vasorelaxant responses to all the tested drugs were inhibited.",

Briefly, 2 month-old CD1 male mice (Charles River, Italy) mice were randomly allocated into 3 groups (n=20 each) feed rat chow containing: 1) pravastatin (40 mg/kg), 2) pravastatin nitroderivative (48 mg/kg), 3) vehicle (regular chow). After 3 days, mice were anaesthetized and left hindlimb ischemia was induced by electro-coagulation of the upper part of femoral artery. Treatment was continued for the following 2 weeks after surgery. Systolic blood pressure was measured by tail cuff technique at 7 and 14 days. The clinical outcome at 14 days was determined by counting the number of necrotic or lost nails in the ischemic foot as well as the number of auto-amputation events. At 14 days from ischemia induction, hindlimbs of anaesthetized mice were perfusion-fixed, both adductors were coded and histologically processed. Capillary and arteriolar densities (ncap/mm2 and nart/mm2) were determined.",
