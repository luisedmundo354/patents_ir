        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention is related to finishing floor plates or wall covers for gas shut-off valves. In particular, the present invention relates to a universal gas valve finishing flange assembly which is adapted to be interfaced with a plurality of gas valves of different sizes.",
        "2. Background of the Invention",
        "Many modern fireplaces now utilize gas to provide a flame or use gas to assist in lighting real firewood. Common to both is a source of natural gas which is piped within proximity of the hearth of the fireplace. Typically, the gas source is controlled by a shut-off valve near the fireplace. Downstream of the shut-off valve, accessories such as log lighter burner pipes or air-gas mixing chambers may be installed to condition the flow of gas out into the fireplace and to distribute the gas such that an optimal flame may be burned.",
        "Most gas shut-off valves provide a stem of which a gas valve key is adapted to interface. For example, the stem most commonly has a square cross section, while the gas valve key normally has a receiving socket which is adapted to receive the stem. A handle is provided on the gas valve key so that the operator can easily provide the leverage to rotate the key. When the handle on the key is turned, the valve may then be opened or closed.",
        "Typically, the gas shut-off valve is positioned proximate the fireplace. For instance, sometimes the gas shut-off valve and affiliated gas pipes may be routed underneath the floor of the dwelling. In this case, the valve stem leg either protrudes directly out of the floor, or it may be recessed underneath the floor. The latter is preferred, not only for aesthetic reasons, but also for safety purposes. I.E. It is safer to have the gas valve stem recessed out of harms way so that it does not inadvertently get damaged. Other times the gas shut-off valve and affiliated gas pipes are routed within the walls of the dwelling. In this case, the gas valve stem is most often recessed into the wall.",
        "In the circumstances when the gas valve stem is recessed either in the floor or wall, it is common practice to use a floor plate, wall cover, finishing flange or other devices to provide aesthetic finishing between the hole in the floor or wall and the leg of the gas valve with the stem.",
        "A common problem occurs when the person who obtains the floor plate or wall cover during the construction phase of the gas fireplace (1) realizes after the purchase of a new floor plate or wall cover, or (2) is apprised by an informed fireplace supplies store employee, that there are different sizes of gas valves. Many times the purchaser brings the finishing device home and then only when an attempt is made to install the finishing onto the leg of the gas shut-off valve which houses the stem, the purchaser is made aware that they bought the wrong sized finishing device. Other times, the purchaser is made aware of the dilemma at the store, and has to make a guess as to which size gas valve their system may utilize.",
        "It would be beneficial to provide a gas valve finishing flange assembly which universally works on different size gas valves. If such a device could be devised, the purchaser would be relieved of the headaches of inadvertently purchasing the wrong size gas valve finishing flange. Moreover, the supplier can save shelf space and reduce inventory by providing a universal gas valve finishing flange, instead of having to stock multiple sets of gas valve finishing flanges which are only capable of being used with one specific sized gas shut-off valve.",
        "The present invention overcomes the aforementioned disadvantages by providing a universal gas valve finishing flange assembly which is adapted to fit to different sized gas shut-off valves.",
        "An exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a flanged coupler, trim plate and reducer nipple, according to an aspect of the present invention. The flanged coupler comprises a pipe coupler having internal threads and a pair of ends. The internal threads are adapted to be received by a first gas shut-off valve with a valve stem leg having threads with a first diameter. The flanged coupler also includes a flange attached to one end of the coupler and centered about an axis defined by the coupler, wherein the flange has an orifice for receiving a gas valve key.",
        "The trim plate has a frontside and a backside and a hole there through to receive the pipe coupler. The trim plate frontside further has a recess to receive the flange. The reducer nipple may be formed from a pipe. The nipple has outer threads and inner threads, wherein the outer threads are correspondingly sized to be received by the internal threads of the pipe coupler, and the inner threads are adapted to be received by a second gas shut-off valve with a valve stem leg having threads with a second diameter.",
        "According to another aspect of the present invention, the flange and pipe coupler are unitarily formed together. According to another aspect of the present invention, the flange and the recess have a circular shape such that the flange may fit flushly within the recess. According to another aspect of the present invention, the flange has a thickness T1 that is generally equivalent to a depth of the recess. In yet another aspect of the present invention, the trim plate has an overall thickness T2, wherein the depth of the recess T1 is less than the thickness T2.",
        "In another aspect of the present invention, the flanged coupler and the trim plate are milled from billet material. According to another aspect of the present invention, the finishing flange assembly is formed from one of plastic, metal, PVC and resin.",
        "Furthermore, according to an aspect of the present invention, the pipe coupler has a plurality of bores, wherein each bore is adapted for receiving a set screw. Moreover, the backside of trim plate adapted to interface a planar surface. According to still another aspect of the present invention, when the flange coupler is installed in the trim plate, the trim plate is adapted to freely rotate about the pipe coupler and the flange. In another aspect of the present invention, the first diameter is \u00be inch and the second diameter is \u00bd inch.",
        "Additionally, a second embodiment of the present invention is provided as a kit for a universal gas valve finishing flange assembly adapted to receive a plurality of different size gas valves. The finishing flange assembly kit includes a flanged coupler comprising a pipe coupler having internal threads and a pair of ends, wherein the internal threads are adapted to be received by a first gas shut-off valve with a valve stem leg having threads with a first diameter.

In one preferred embodiment, the flange assembly 2 may be milled from billet aluminum.",
        "The flanged coupler 4 comprises two main components including a circular flange 26 and an internally threaded pipe coupler 28. The flange 26 is centered about the axis defined by the coupler 28 and has a diameter D1 and thickness T1. The circular flange 26 and pipe coupler portion 28 are preferably unitarily formed, however, the coupler 28 may be attached to the end of the coupler by other means such as welding or other fusion technologies known in the art. An orifice 24 is disposed through the center of the circular flange 26 to provide unobstructed access to the valve stem 42 of the gas shut-off valve 10 or 12. In a preferred embodiment, the size of the internal threads 29 in the coupler 28 are adapted to receive a valve stem leg 44 of a \u00be inch gas valve shut-off valve 10. However, it is appreciated that the size of the internal threads 29 may vary according to various embodiments and applications. Also, the coupler 28 has a diameter D2, the significance of which is discussed later. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the coupler 28 further includes a plurality of threaded holes 21 to receive small set screws 22.",
        "The trim plate 6 is a separate part which preferably has a circular shape and has an overall thickness T2. The trim plate 6 includes a centered circular receiving recess 33. The shape of the recess 33 is adapted to flushly receive the circular flange 26. Thus, the diameter of the recess 33 is slightly larger than the circular flange 26 diameter D1 and the depth of the recess 33 may be about the same thickness T1 of the flange 26. To form the receiving recess 33, an outer rim 32 is provided about the circular perimeter of the trim plate 6. A recessed shoulder side 34 defines the inner circular perimeter of the recess 33. Additionally, a recessed surface 36 forms the bottom of the recess 33. The backside 37 of the trim plate 6 is preferably flat so that it will easily interface with the planer surface of a floor 16 or wall 18. Moreover, a centered circular hole 35 having a diameter slightly greater than the coupler 28 diameter D2 is disposed through the trim plate 6. As shown in FIG. 1, the trim plate 6 hole 35 is adapted to receive the coupler portion 28.",
        "The reducer nipple 8 may be formed from piping. The nipple 8 has outer threads 38 and inner threads 40. The outer threads 40 are sized such that they can be received by internal threads 29 disposed within the coupler portion 28. Thus, in the exemplary embodiment, the outer threads 38 preferably have a diameter of \u00be inch. Furthermore, the inner threads 40, preferably have a \u00bd inch diameter which are adapted to receive a \u00bd inch valve stem leg 43 (see FIGS. 2 and 4). It is appreciated that the size of the outer threads 38 and inner threads 40 may vary according to various embodiments and applications of the present invention.",
        "The following paragraphs now describe the various configurations in which the universal gas valve finishing flange assembly 2 may be implemented. FIG. 1 is an exploded view of an exemplary embodiment of the universal gas valve finishing flange assembly 2 configured to be installed onto a \u00be inch gas shut-off valve 10, according to an aspect of the present invention. If a \u00be inch gas shut-off valve 10 is utilized in the gas fireplace system, only the flanged coupler 4 and trim plate 6 are utilized.",
        "FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of the universal gas valve finishing flange assembly 2 installed onto the \u00be inch gas shut-off valve 10 located behind a wall 18, according to an aspect of the present invention. From FIG. 3, it can be seen how the flange assembly 2 is assembled and installed. The valve 10 should be positioned proximate a desired position on the backside of the wall 18 such that the valve stem leg 44 is oriented toward and normal to the wall 18. Also, a hole 17 should be cut into the wall 18 such that access to the valve stem leg 44 is provided. Then, the coupler portion 28 of the flanged coupler 4 is inserted through the receiving hole 35 disposed in the trim plate 6 such that the receiving recess 33 is facing toward the bottom of the circular flange portion 26. Next, the flanged coupler 4 is then threaded onto the threads disposed on the outer surface of the valve stem leg 44. The flanged coupler 4 may then be tightened until the flange portion 26 is flushly received into the receiving recess 33. Additionally, if access is available from behind the wall 18, a pair of set screws 22 may be installed into set screw holes 23 on the coupler portion 28 to further secure the coupler portion 28 to the valve stem leg 44. To operate the valve 10, a gas valve key 14 may then be inserted into a cavity 50 which is formed internally within the coupler portion 28. In particular, the socket of the key 14 is adapted to receive the exposed distal tip of the valve stem 42. The valve 10 may then be opened or closed by turning the gas valve key 14.",
        "FIG. 2 is an exploded view of an exemplary embodiment of the universal gas valve finishing flange assembly 2 configured to be installed onto a \u00bd inch gas shut-off valve 10, according to an aspect of the present invention. When a \u00bd inch gas shut-off valve is utilized in the gas fireplace system, the reducer nipple 8 is used in conjunction with the flanged coupler 4 and trim plate 6.",
        "FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of the universal gas valve finishing flange assembly 2 installed onto the \u00bd inch gas shut-off valve 10 positioned underneath a floor 16, according to another aspect of the present invention. From FIG. 4, it is seen how the flange assembly 2 may be assembled and installed. The valve 10 should be positioned proximate a desired position underneath the floor 16 such that the valve stem leg 44 is upwardly oriented toward and normal to the floor 16. Also, a hole 17 should be cut into the floor 16 such that access to the valve stem leg 44 is provided. Then, the coupler portion 28 of the flanged coupler 4 is inserted through the receiving hole 35 disposed in the trim plate 6 such that the receiving recess 33 is facing toward the bottom of the circular flange portion 26. Next, the reducer nipple 8 is threaded into the coupler portion 28 to provide the flange assembly with \u00bd inch threads for receiving the valve stem leg 44 of the \u00bd inch gas shut-off valve 12. The flanged coupler 4 is then threaded onto the \u00bd inch threads disposed on the outer surface of the valve stem leg 44. The flanged coupler 4 should then be tightened until the flange portion 26 is flushly received into the receiving recess 33 of the trim plate 6. Additionally, if access is available from underneath the floor 16, a pair of set screws 22 may be installed into set screw holes 23 on the coupler portion 28 to further secure the coupler portion 28 to the valve stem leg 44. To operate the valve 12, a gas valve key 14 may then be inserted into a cavity 50 which is formed internally within the coupler portion 28. In particular, the socket of the key 14 is adapted to receive the exposed distal tip of the valve stem 42. The valve 12 may then be opened or closed by turning the gas valve key 14.",
        "FIG. 5 shows an exemplary installation of the universal gas valve finishing flange assembly 2 installed into a floor 16. Once the flange assembly 2 is installed, the only visible parts are the outer rim 32 of the trim plate 6 and the frontside of the circular flange 26 of the flanged coupler 4. As shown in FIG. 5, the orifice 24 provides a pathway through the cavity 50 in which the valve stem 42 is housed.",
