        "The present invention is directed toward chromium complexes and their use in olefin polymerization. More specifically the invention is directed toward chromium trihalide complexes having bis-benzimidazole ligands and their use in olefin polymerization.",
        "Nitrogen-based chelates of transition metals such as Ti, Ni, Pd, Co and Fe have been actively investigated in recent years as olefin polymerization catalysts. Those incorporating bidentate \u03b1-diimine and tridentate bisminopyridine ligands have been found to be highly active catalysts for olefin polymerization.",
        "More recently, similar investigations of coordination chemistry and catalysis have been extended to chromium (III) complexes containing certain imidizole-based chelate ligands. These complexes, when activated with methyl aluminoxane (\u201cMAO\u201d) were found to catalyze the oligomerization of ethylene. (See Ruther et al, Organometallics, 2001, 20, 1247-1250).",
        "Despite the advances made in catalyst systems employing chromium, there is a continuing need for new catalysts that will provide a greater degree of control over polymerization processes. Homogenous, chromium-based catalysts are believed to possess the potential of providing better control over polymerization processes than many other organometallic catalysts. For example, a neutral nickel (II) catalyst containing bidentate monoanionic ligands produce linear \u03b1-olefins with a very wide range Schulz-Flory type distribution. An object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide novel chromium based catalysts useful in the polymerization of olefins.",

        "In a 250 mL 35/25 ball joint flask, 1,2-phenylenediamine (54 mmol) was combined with malonic acid (2 equivalents). Polyphosphoric acid (\u02dc100 g) was added directly to the solid mixture. The flask was fitted with an air-driven mechanical stirring shaft and heated to 160\u00b0 C. under a nitrogen purge maintained with a septum and needle. The molten mixture was stirred for 7 hours and subsequently poured slowly into a large (1 L) excess of cold water. A Waring\u2122 blender was used to grind the solid product/water slurry.

The product, 1,1\u2032-bis(1-butylbenzimidazol-2-yl)pentane, was isolated by filtration and dried in a vacuum oven at 110\u00b0 C. for several days. A 23.00 g (0.093 mol) quantity of this product was placed in a 300 mL round bottom flask with a side arm. This was followed by the addition of 25 mL of anhydrous DMSO. The flask was then fitted with a bubbler. Under a flow of nitrogen, 6.0 g of sodium hydride (60% dispersion in mineral oil) was added over one hour while stirring at 0\u00b0 C. The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature, and 25.00 mL (0.220 mol) of 1-iodobutane was added dropwise over one hour. The reaction mixture was left stirring under nitrogen for 48 hours. The reaction mixture was quenched with water and then an additional 400 mL of water was added. After stirring for one half hour, a biphasic solution was obtained. The organic layer was extracted with cyclohexane and was washed with water. The volatiles were removed from the cyclohexane phase under reduced pressure to leave a dark oil. The oil was chromatographed on silica gel with methylene chloride as the eluent.

Anhydrous, nitrogen-sparged DMSO (135 mL) was cannulated into the flask, resulting in a purple solution. Separately, a 500 mL three-necked flask equipped with a stirbar, addition funnel, vacuum adapter, and a septum was assembled in the glove box. Sodium hydride (powder, 1.15 g, 48.10 mmol) was added, and the flask was placed under argon on a Schlenk line. Anhydrous DMSO (35 mL) was added via cannula to form a slurry. The bis-benzimidazole solution was then cannulated into the addition funnel and added dropwise to the sodium hydride slurry over a 30 minute period at 0\u00b0 C., giving a cloudy black solution. The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature over a 2 hour period and sparged iodobutane (8.86 g, 48.12 mmol) was added.

        "Subsequently, bis(4-methyl-2-benzimidazolyl)methane (10.0 g, 36.2 mmol) was reacted with NaH (3.47 g, 145 mmol) and iodobutane (12.4 mL, 20.1 g, 109 mmol) in anhydrous DMSO following a procedure analogous to the procedure given for 1,2-bis(1-butylbenzimidazol-2-yl)-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane in Example 3. Following extraction, the burgundy-black product mixture (14.04 g, 87%) was eluted in batches through a silica gel column using 90:10 CH2Cl2/ethyl acetate. The collected product (Rf\u02dc0.7) was not completely separable from impurities at Rf\u02dc0.25-0.30 and the solvent front, and was subsequently eluted through a large neutral alumina column (J. T. Baker Type IB; 41 mm ID; stationary phase height \u02dc40 cm) using CH2Cl2.

        "This material was prepared following a procedure analogous to example 4. The reagents used were TriBu-4,4\u2032-diMe-BBIM (0.561 g, 1.26 mmol, soluble in THF) and CrCl3.(THF)3 (0.473 g, 1.26 mmol).

        "99.9% pure ethylene (Grade 4.5, 99.995%, BOC Gases) was used as received. Methyl aluminoxane (30 wt % solution in toluene) was used as received from Albemarle. Toluene used as a solvent was dried by passing through purification columns of copper catalyst to remove oxygen and alumina to remove moisture (Pangborn, A. B.; Giardello, M. A.; Grubbs, R. H.; Rosen, R. K.; Timmers, F. J. Organometallics 1996, 15, 1518-1520). The polymer products were characterized by 1H, and 13C NMR using a Varian INOVA 300 spectrometer with a 5 mm switchable broadband probe. Molecular weights were determined using a Waters Associates 150 C High Temperature gel permeation chromatography chromatograph equipped with three Polymer Laboratories mixed bed Type B columns in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 135\u00b0 C., using a Waters DRI detector and a polyethylene calibration curve.",
        "Polymerizations were run in a 300 mL Parr\u2122 reactor fitted with a mechanical stirrer. Catalyst was weighed in a glass liner under argon in the glove box; then, 75 mL of solvent was added to the catalyst. The reactor was then sealed and brought out of the glove box and attached to the ethylene feed. The specified amount of methyl aluminoxane solution was added to the reactor after dissolving ethylene in the solution at atmospheric pressure. The pressure was then increased to that specified for the run and the temperature for the run was set. At the end of the reaction, excess ethylene was vented, and the reaction was quenched with methanol. After cooling, the polymer was isolated by precipitation into acidic methanol, followed by drying under vacuum. Conditions and results are summarized in Table 1.",
