        "Variety denomination: \u2018GG DEL WY06\u2019.",
        "The new cultivar \u2018GG DEL WY06\u2019 is a product of open pollination in a heterogeneous population of Osteospermum mass selection. The new cultivar was discovered and selected by Leo Van Zanten in May 2004 in Carpinteria, Calif.",
        "Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar \u2018GG DEL WY06\u2019 by cuttings from adventitious shoots was performed in Oxnard, Calif., and has shown that the unique features of this new cultivar are stable and reproduced true to type on successive generations.",
        "The cultivar \u2018GG DEL WY06\u2019 has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature, daylength, and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype.",
        "The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of \u2018GG DEL WY06.\u2019 These characteristics in combination distinguish \u2018GG DEL WY06\u2019 as a new and distinct Osteospermum cultivar.\n\n    \n    \n        1. Daisy type inflorescence;\n        2. Creamy white ray florets;\n        3. Gray-orange disc florets with a gray-green center; and\n        4. A free branching habit.",
        "There is not parent variety to compare to \u2018GG DEL WY06.\u2019",
        "In comparison to the commercially available variety \u2018Vanilla Cream\u2019 (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 12,149), \u2018GG DEL WY06\u2019 is shorter but wider than the comparable variety. Also, \u2018GG DEL WY06\u2019 has more leaves per lateral branch and obovate-shaped leaves compared to the elliptical leaves of \u2018Vanilla Cream.\u2019 Additionally, the new variety has a smaller inflorescence diameter but a longer inflorescence depth. Also, the upper surface of the ray florets of the new variety \u2018GG DEL WY06\u2019 are more yellow-white than the ray florets of \u2018Vanilla Cream\u2019. Further, the longitudinal stripes on the lower surface of the ray florets of \u2018GG DEL WY06\u2019 are a lighter, creamier yellow. Finally, the disc florets of \u2018GG DEL WY06\u2019 are gray-orange and gray-green compared to the single gray-green disc florets of the comparable variety.",
        "The accompanying photograph in drawing illustrates in full color a typical plant of \u2018GG DEL WY06\u2019 grown in a 6-inch pot, planted late October and grown outdoors. The plant is 18 weeks old. The growing temperature ranged from 12\u00b0 C. to 15\u00b0 C. at night to 12\u00b0 C. to 20\u00b0 C. during the day. The colors are as nearly true as is reasonably possible in a color representation of this type.",
        "In the following description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used. The following observations and measurements describe \u2018GG DEL WY06\u2019 plants grown in Oxnard, Ventura County, Calif., during the months of October through February. The growing temperature ranged from 12\u00b0 C. to 15\u00b0 C. at night to 12\u00b0 C. to 20\u00b0 C. during the day.
