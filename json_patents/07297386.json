    "description": [
        "The present invention relates to an antireflection structure to be used for various purposes including window panels for various displays, such as liquid crystal displays, to prevent reflection from the surfaces.",
        "Reflection of light from a window panel disposed in front of a display unit employing a liquid crystal display or the like or from various optical devices often causes troubles. For example, in a portable telephone provided with a liquid crystal display (LCD) having a display panel, a window panel of transparent plastic plate is disposed in front of the surface of the display panel to protect the display panel of the LCD from water, dust and external forces (JP7-66859A).",
        "The outer and the inner surface of the window panel disposed in front of the display panel reflect external light, which deteriorates the visibility of matters displayed on the display panel. Furthermore, part of light emerging from the display panel is reflected by the window panel toward the display panel, which reduces the efficiency of utilization of light emitted by the display panel and hence the visibility is deteriorated accordingly. Additional power is necessary to compensate for such deterioration of visibility, which is a significant problem in a portable telephone in which the reduction of power consumption is very important.",
        "To solve such problems, it is general, as mentioned in JP2001-127852A, to coat a surface which reflects light undesirably, with a single film of a material having a low refractive index or with a multilayer antireflection film of a layer of a material having a low refractive index and a layer of a material having a high refractive index for an antireflection treatment, by, for example, an evaporation process, a sputtering process or a coating process.",
        "An antiglare technique disclosed in, for example, JP9-193332A, finishes a surface of a window panel in a matte surface of a scale not shorter than the wavelengths of light to reduce regular reflection by diffusing light by the matte surface. This antiglare technique improves antiglare property and the reflection of the background scenery in the screen of a display can be prevented when the screen is viewed from a position right in front of it.",
        "The antireflection film formed on the window panel by evaporation, sputtering or the like must be formed in a thin film having a specific refraction index and a thickness by a single or a plurality of batch processes, which causes problems in the stability of products and fraction defective. The productivity of a batch production system is low and hence the costs of products produced by the batch production system increases.",
        "This known antiglare technique is unable to increase transmittance in proportion to the reduction of reflectance and hence unable to improve light utilization efficiency.",
        "The applicant of the present invention patent application tried to use a technique disclosed in JP50-70040A that forms minute projections arranged at intervals not longer than the wavelengths of light in a surface to reduce reflective quality of the surface to solve problems in those prior art techniques for antireflection processing.",
        "A minute projection forming method according to the technique disclosed in JP50-70040A coats a surface, to be processed for an antireflection process, of an optical member, such as a lens, with a photoresist film, exposes the photoresist film to light and develops the exposed photoresist film to form a resist pattern. Parts of the surface of the optical member not coated with the resist pattern are etched to form minute projections directly in the surface of each optical member.",
        "This minute projection forming method, however, is inefficient, is unable to process workpieces at a productivity (mass-productivity) sufficient for producing industrial products. The applicant of the present patent application formed such minute projections in a surface of a glass plate to obtain a mother plate, and formed a master plate by transferring the pattern of the minute projections from the mother plate to a metal plate by a nickel electroforming process prevalently used by compact disk manufacturing lines. The applicant of the present patent application succeeded in achieving productivity effective for the mass production of industrial products by using the master plate.",
        "The primary object of all the conventional techniques including the foregoing prior art techniques is to form minute projections at intervals not longer than wavelengths of light in a surface of a workpiece, and dimensional studies of the known techniques are concentrated on reducing dimensional elements, such as height and intervals, of minute projections. Thus, any studies of morphological factors defining the shapes of individual minute projections have not been made. The inventors of the present invention have studied morphological factors of minute projections with an intention to improve the antireflection property of a surface and have made the present invention.",
        "Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to improve the ability of an antireflection structure having a surface provided with minute projections capable of reducing useless reflection, improving the visibility of a displayed picture and enhancing the efficiency of display light.",
        "According to the present invention, an antireflection structure comprises: a base having the shape of a flat plate; and a finely roughened antireflection part formed in a surface of the base; wherein the finely roughened antireflection part includes a plurality of projections and depressions defined by the projections, the projections are distributed such that PMAX\u2266\u03bbMIN, where PMAX is the biggest one of distances between the tips of the adjacent projections and \u03bbMIN is the shortest one of wavelengths of visible light rays in a vacuum, the sectional area of each projection in a plane parallel to the surface of the base increases continuously from the tip of the projection toward the bottom of the depression, and a sectional shape tip of a tip part of each projection in a plane perpendicular to the surface of the base is sharper than that of a bottom part of each depression in the same plane vertical to the surface of the base.",
        "In the antireflection structure according to the present invention, the finely roughened antireflection part meet inequalities: nb\u22671 and PMAX\u2266\u03bbMIN/nb, where nb is the refractive index of the base.",
        "In the antireflection structure according to the present invention, a section of the finely roughened antireflection part in a plane perpendicular to the surface of the base has a height H, a tip part of the section above a level at H/2 has a sectional area smaller than that of a bottom part of the section below the level at H/2.",
        "In the antireflection structure according to the present invention, the tip part of the projection of the section above the level of H/2 has a width, at the level of H/2, smaller than that of the bottom part of the depression of the section below the level of H/2 at the level of H/2 in the plane perpendicular to the surface of the base.",
        "In the antireflection structure according to the present invention, a section of the finely roughened antireflection part in a plane perpendicular to the surface of the base is formed of only curves.",
        "In the antireflection structure according to the present invention, a section of the finely roughened antireflection part in a plane perpendicular to the surface of the base is formed of only straight lines.",
        "In the antireflection structure according to the present invention, a straight line extends from the tip of the projection to the bottom of the depression.",
        "In the antireflection structure according to the present invention, a polygonal line extends from the tip of the projection to the bottom of the depression.",
        "In the antireflection structure according to the present invention, a sectional shape of each projection in a plane perpendicular to the surface of the base is symmetrical.",
        "In the antireflection structure according to the present invention, a sectional shape of each depression in a plane perpendicular to the surface of the base is asymmetrical.",
        "In the antireflection structure according to the present invention, the base and the finely roughened part are formed of the same material.",
        "In the antireflection structure according to the present invention, the base has a main base part, and a surface base on the base part provided with the finely roughened antireflection part including the projections and the depressions.",
        "The finely roughened antireflection part, having the minute projections, of the antireflection structure according to the present invention prevents the reflection of light by the surface of the antireflection structure. The antireflection effect of the finely roughened antireflection part of the antireflection structure, including the minute projections of a specified shape having a tip part sharper than a bottom part of a specified shape of of the adjacent depression, is superior to that of a surface provided with a finely roughened antireflection part including projections of a uniformly tapered shape or a shape in which a bottom part of the depression is sharper than a tip part the minute projection. To be brief, the reason why the finely roughened antireflection part prevents the reflection of light, is the effect of minute projections arranged at intervals shorter than wavelengths of light on a surface of a structure to make the refractive index at the interface between air and the surface of the structure change gradually and continuously. Thus, reflection of light, which is a phenomenon that occurs when refractive index changes suddenly discontinuously, can be prevented.",
        "The antireflection effect of the surface of the antireflection structure of the present invention provided with the finely roughened antireflection part is different from that of an antiglare matte surface that reflects light by specular scattering, and prevents reflection by changing refractive index gradually continuously at the interface of air and the antireflection structure. Therefore, the transmittance of the antireflection structure increases in proportion to the reduction of the refractive index thereof. Thus, when the antireflection structure is used as a window panel for a display screen of a display or the like, the visibility of the screen can be improved and the efficiency of the display light can be improved.",

        "Referring to FIGS. 1(A) to 1(C), an antireflection structure 10 in a first embodiment according to the present invention serving as a window panel is disposed in front of a liquid crystal display panel 10A. The antireflection structure includes a base 1, and a finely roughened antireflection part 2 formed in a surface of the base 1.",
        "The finely roughened antireflection part 2 includes minute projections 2p each having a tip 2t, and depressions 2d formed between the adjacent minute projections 2p and each having a bottom 2b. The sectional area of each minute projection 2p in a plane parallel to the surface of the base increases continuously from the tip 2t toward the bottom 2b of the depression 2d as shown in FIG. 1(B). A shape 2Mt of a tip part 2Mt of each minute projection 2p in a plane perpendicular to the surface of the base 1 is sharper than a shape 2Mb of a bottom part 2Mb of each depression 2d in the same plane perpendicular to the surface of the base 1.",
        "The finely roughened antireflection part 2 including the minute projections 2p and depressions 2d having the foregoing shapes improves the antireflection effect of the base 1.",
        "To put it plainly, tip parts 2Mt of projections 2p and bottom parts 2Mb of depressions 2d of a sinusoidal wave or a triangular wave have the same sharpness. Tip parts Mt or bottom parts Mb may have a triangular sectional shape (projections having the shape of a circular cone) as shown in FIG. 5(D), and tip parts Mt or bottom parts Mb may have a round sectional shape in some other finely roughened antireflection parts.",
        "The minute projections 2p are parts of the base 1, and the depressions 2d are spaces between the adjacent minute projections 2p; that is, the shape 2Mt is the shape of a part of the base 1 and the shape 2Mb is the shape of a space between the adjacent projections.",
        "The antireflection function of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 of the antireflection structure of the present invention is different from that of a conventional antireflection structure having a matte surface provided with protrusions of sizes greater than wavelengths of light, which provides an antireflection effect by specular scattering of light. Since the finely roughened antireflection part 2 of the present invention reduces the reflectance of the antireflection structure 10 by the minute projections 2p arranged at intervals shorter than the wavelengths of visible light rays, the transmittance can be improved in proportion to the reduction of reflectance.",
        "In a sectional shape of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 in a plane perpendicular to the surface of the base 1 may be a curved wavy form similar to a sinusoidal curve as shown in FIG. 1(B), may be a polygonal wavy form, in which the tip 2t of the minute projection 2p and the bottom 2b of the adjacent depression 2d is connected by a straight line or a polygonal line, or may be a wavy form including the curved wavy form and the polygonal wavy form in combination. The sectional shape of the minute projections 2p in a plane parallel to the surface of the base 1 may be circular or may be any optional shape.",
        "Although the antireflection structure 10 shown in FIG. 1 is flat, the antireflection structure 10 may be curved. In an antireflection structure in a modification, two finely roughened antireflection parts may be formed on both the major surfaces of a base, respectively.",
        "Finely Roughened Antireflection Part",
        "The finely roughened antireflection part 2 has the antireflection effect for the following reasons.",
        "The finely roughened antireflection part 2 prevents the sudden, discontinuous change of refractive index between the base 1 of the antireflection structure 10 and the environment (air) and make refractive index change gradually and continuously. Reflection of light is a phenomenon caused to occur by sudden, discontinuous change of refractive index at the interface between substances. Therefore, reflection of light by the surface of the antireflection structure 10 can be reduced by making refractive index change spatially continuously around the surface of the antireflection structure 10.",
        "Although the base 1 usually is transparent and transmissive to light, the antireflection structure has an antireflection effect of reducing surface reflection even if the base 1 is opaque.",
        "Reasons that the finely roughened antireflection part 2 formed on the surface of the base 1 has the antireflection effect will be described on an assumption that the base 1 is transparent.",
        "FIGS. 2 to 5 are conceptional illustrations of the distribution of refractive index determined by the finely roughened antireflection part 2 formed in the surface of the base 1. In FIG. 2, the sharpness of the minute projections of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 characteristic of the present invention is not precisely delineated for simplicity.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2, the base 1 of the antireflection structure 10 extends in a space where Z\u22660, and the finely roughened part 2 having the minute projections 2p is formed on an XY-plane where Z=0 so that the minute projections 2p projects in a direction parallel to the Z-axis.",
        "The interval PMAX between the adjacent tips 2t of the minute projections 2p are not longer than the shortest wavelength \u03bbMIN among the wavelengths of visible light rays in a vacuum. Therefore, the respective refractive indices of the media, i.e., the antireflection structure 1 and air with respect to light fallen on the finely roughened antireflection part 2 are spatially distributed. However, since the size of distribution of the projections 2p is not greater than the relevant wavelength, the distributed refractive indices do not act directly on light but averaged refractive indices act on light. Thus, the reflection of light can be prevented when the averaged refractive index, i.e., effective refractive index, changes continuously with the distance of travel of light.",
        "The interval PMAX is the longest one of distances between the tips 2t of the adjacent minute projections 2p of the finely roughened antireflection part 2. The minute projections of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 may be formed so that the tips 2t are arranged regularly at equal intervals, or may be formed so that the tips 2t are arranged irregularly at different intervals.",
        "An orthogonal coordinate system shown in FIG. 2 has a Z-axis perpendicular to the surface of the base 1, and an X-axis and a Y-axis extending perpendicularly to each other in a plane perpendicular to the Z-axis. Suppose that light fallen on the base 1 is traveling through the base 1 in a direction parallel to the Z-axis toward the side of negative values for Z and reaches a plane at Z=z parallel to an XY-plane defined by the X- and the Y-axis.",
        "Since the finely roughened antireflection part 2 is formed on the surface of the base 1, an apparent refractive index of the medium has a distribution f(x, y, z) in the plane parallel to the XY-plane; that is, parts of the base 1 has a refractive index nb on the order of 1.5, and spaces a filled with air between the minute projections have a refractive index na on the order of 1.0 as shown in FIG. 3.",
        "Actually, the mean refractive index determined by averaging a refractive index distribution of a spatial scale smaller than the wavelength of light (the minimum wavelength \u03bbMIN among the wavelengths of light rays when light has a wavelength distribution) affect the light. Consequently, the effective refractive index nef, i.e., the mean refractive index, is equal to the integral of the refractive index distribution f(x, y, z) in the plane parallel to the XY-plane.\n\nnef(z)=\u222b\u222bf(x,y,z)dxdy\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nThus, as shown in FIG. 4, the distribution of the effective refractive index nef is represented by a function of only z, i.e., nef(z).",
        "If the sectional area of the minute projections 2p of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 in a plane parallel to the XY-plane increases continuously from the tips 2t of the minute projections 2p to the bottoms 2b of the depressions 2d, the ratio of area between parts of the base 1 and parts filled with air changes continuously along the Z-axis. Consequently, the effective refractive index nef(z) is a continuous faction of z.",
        "Suppose that light travels from a first medium having a refractive index n0 into a second medium having a refractive index n1 and the light falls on the surface of the second medium at an incidence angle \u03b8=0\u00b0, i.e., the light falls on the second medium perpendicularly to the surface of the second medium. Incidence angle is the angle formed by a ray of light arriving at a surface and the perpendicular to the surface at the point of arrival of the ray of light on the surface.",
        "In this case, the reflectance R is not dependent on polarization or incidence angle, and is represented by Expression (2)",

        "When the effective refractive index is represented by a continuous function of z, the effective refractive index nef(z) at Z=z is n0, and the effective refractive index nef(z+\u0394z) at Z=z+\u0394z is n1, n1\u2192n0 if \u0394z\u21920, and hence, from Expression (2), R\u21920.",
        "More rigorously, when light of a wavelength \u03bb travels in a medium having a refractive index n, the actual wavelength of the light is \u03bb/n, which is generally shorter than \u03bb. When the medium is air, the refractive index n of air is approximately equal to 1 and hence it is possible to consider that \u03bb/n\u2248\u03bb. However, since the base 1 is formed usually of a material having a refractive index of about 1.5, such as a resin, the wavelength of the light of a wavelength \u03bb traveling through the base 1 is on the order of 0.7\u03bb. When such conditions are taken into consideration, the reduction of reflectance of the depressions 2d of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 by the averaging of refractive index can be expected if a condition: PMAX\u2266\u03bbMIN is satisfied. If \u03bbMIN/nb\u2266PMAX\u2266\u03bbMIN, the effect of the projections 2p of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 on the reduction of reflectance by the averaging of refractive index cannot be expected at all.",
        "However, the depressions 2d filled with air is effective in reducing reflectance, and therefore the finely roughened antireflection part 2 has an antireflection effect.",
        "If the condition: PMAX\u2266\u03bbMIN/nb also is satisfied, both the depressions 2d and the minute projections 2p can meet a requirement that the interval PMAX is shorter than the shortest wavelength, the antireflection effect of the averaging of refractive index is perfect.",
        "Suppose that \u03bbMIN=380 nm, i.e., the shortest one of the wavelengths in the waveband of visible light, and nb=1.5. Then, \u03bbMIN/nb=250 nm and hence PMAX may be 250 nm or below.",
        "A first basic condition for the shape of the minute projections 2p of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 is that the sectional area of a section of each minute projection in a plane parallel to the XY-plane increases gradually continuously from the tip 2t thereof toward the bottom 2b of the depression 2d.",
        "Thus, at least a part of the side surface of the minute projection must be oblique, i.e., at least a part of a section of the minute projection in a plane perpendicular to the surface of the base 1 is an oblique line. The minute projections 2p of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 may be such a minute projection as shown in FIG. 5(G) having an inclined line 12 and a vertical side surface 13. Preferably, the minute projections 2p have a shape such that the ratio of the sectional area of the minute projections 2p in a plane parallel to the XY-plane of the base 1 is converged to perfectly 0 in a plane including the tips 2t and is converged to perfectly 1 in a plane including the bottoms 2b, i.e., the surface of the base 1, such as those shown in FIGS. 5(A), 5(C), 5(F) and 5(G). Minute projections 2p, not shown, having a shape such that the ratio is converged to approximately 0 (minute projections having flat tips) in a plane including the tips 2t, and the ratio is converged to approximately 1 in a plane including the bottoms 2b are effective to some extent. The projections 2p of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 may be of any shape, provided that the foregoing conditions and the following second basic condition are satisfied.",
        "Therefore, the sections of the side lines 12 of each minute projection 2p in a plane perpendicular to the surface of the base 1 may be defined by a straight line, a curve, a polygonal line or a combination of some of those lines.",
        "The most preferable shapes of the finely roughened antireflection parts 2 to make the effective refractive index nef(z) as the function of z change continuously from the refractive index na of air to the refractive index nb of the base 1 are those shown in FIGS. 5(A) and 5(C). In each of the shapes shown in FIGS. 5(A) and 5(C), the ratio of the sectional area of the minute projections 2p in a plane parallel to the XY-plane and including the tips 2t of the base 1 is converged to 0, and the ratio of the sectional area of the minute projections 2p in a plane parallel to the XY-plane and including the bottoms 2b of the base 1 is converged to 1.",
        "A second basic condition for the shape of the minute projections 2p of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 defines the sharpness of the tips 2t of the minute projections 2p and that of the bottoms 2b of the depressions 2d. As shown typical by a sectional view in FIG. 1(B), a shape 2Mt of a tip part Mt of each projection 2p in a plane perpendicular to the surface of the base 1 is sharper than a shape 2Mb of a bottom part Mb of each depression 2d in the same plane vertical to the surface of the base 1.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1(B), a boundary line L between the tip parts Mt of the minute projections 2p and the bottom parts Mb of the depressions 2d is at a level equal to H/2, where H is the height of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 (of the minute projections 2p) from the surface of the base 1.",
        "The expression: \u201ctip parts Mt of the minute projections are sharper than the bottom parts Mb of the depressions\u201d means that the shape 2Mt of the tip part Mt is sharper than the shape 2Mb of the bottom part Mb, as compared with the relation between the tip parts and the bottom parts of a sinusoidal wave or a triangular wave in which the tip parts and the bottom parts have the same shape.",
        "FIGS. 1(B) and 1(C) are typical sectional views of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 taken on a plane vertical to the surface of the base 1.",
        "In FIG. 1(C), the shape 2Mt of the tip part Mt having the tip 2t and the shape 2Mb of the bottom part Mb having the bottom 2b are superposed by inverting the shape 2Mb of the bottom part 2Mb. As obvious from FIG. 1(C), the width Wt of the shape 2Mt of the tip part 2Mt on the boundary line L is smaller than the width Wb of the shape 2Mb of the bottom part 2Mb on the boundary line L, i.e., Wt<Wb.",
        "The sharpness of the shape 2Mt of the tip part Mt is that of the shape of a part of the base 1, and the sharpness of the shape 2Mb of the bottom part Mb of the depression is that of a space between the adjacent minute projections; that is, the shape 2Mt is the shape of a part of the base 1 and the shape 2Mb is the shape of a space between the adjacent projections.",
        "The sectional shape of the sharp tip part Mt having the tip 2b of the minute projection or the sharp bottom part Mb having a bottom 2b of the depression may be a triangle having a sharp tip part forming an acute angle (actual shape of the tip part Mt or the bottom part Mb is a circular cone, pyramid or the like) as shown in FIG. 5(C) or may be a triangle having a round tip part as shown in FIG. 1(B) or 5(A). Both the tip 2t and the bottom 2b may be sharp points, both the tip 2t and the bottom 2b may be round points, or either the tip 2t (the bottom 2b) or the bottom 2b (the tip 2t) may be a sharp point and the other may be a round point.",
        "As mentioned above, among the finely roughened antireflection parts 2 according to the present invention which are the same in dimensional quality, i.e., in the intervals between the minute projections 2p and the height of the minute projections 2p, the finely roughened antireflection part 2 including the minute projections having the tip part Mt having the tips 2t and the shape 2Mt sharper than the shape 2Mb of the bottom part Mb having the bottoms 2b of the depressions 2d by a greater degree is more effective in reducing reflectance.",
        "For example, the antireflection effect of the finely roughened antireflection part 2A shown in FIG. 5(A) and conforming to the present invention is higher than that of a finely roughened antireflection part 2B shown in FIG. 5(B) having tip parts Mt and bottom parts Mb of the same sharpness.",
        "Although the effect of the difference in sharpness between the tip parts and the bottom parts is explained with reference to FIGS. 5(A) and 5(B) comparatively showing the finely roughened antireflection parts each having a sectional shape in a plane perpendicular to the base 1 formed only of curves similar to sinusoidal curves, the effect of the difference in sharpness is the same with finely roughened antireflection parts each having minute projections 2p having a triangular sectional shape in a plane perpendicular to the base 1. Although the shape of a section in a plane perpendicular to the base 1 of the minute projection has lines 12 each consisting of only at least two straight lines, the shape of the section is not a triangle in the strict sense of word, such a shape are generally triangular and hence such a shape will be referred to as a triangular shape.",
        "When the respective reflectances of a finely roughened antireflection part 2C shown in FIG. 5(C) having tip parts Mt sharper than bottom parts Mb, a finely roughened antireflection part 2D shown in FIG. 5(D) having tip parts Mt of the same sharpness as bottom parts Mb, and a finely roughened antireflection part 2E shown in FIG. 5(E) having tip parts Mt less sharp than bottom parts Mb are compared, the order of the finely roughened antireflection parts 2C, 2D and 2E in the magnitude of reflectance is 2C<2D<2E. The finely roughened antireflection part 2C conforms to the present invention and the finely roughened antireflection parts 2D and 2E do not conform to the present invention.",
        "It is most effective and most preferable that the finely roughened antireflection part of the present invention has the minute projections 2p and the depressions 2d formed such that the tip parts Mt are sharper than the bottom parts Mb as shown in FIGS. 5(A) and 5(C) in sectional shape in any one of planes perpendicular to the base 1 and extending in all directions. A finely roughened antireflection part having minute projections 2p and depressions 2d as shown in FIG. 5(A) or 5(C) formed such that the tip parts Mt of the minute projections 2p are sharper than the bottom parts Mb of the depressions 2d in sections in most planes perpendicular to the base 1, and the tip parts Mt is the same as the bottom parts Mb in sharpness or is less sharp than the bottom parts Mb as shown in FIG. 5(D) or 5(E) in sections in some planes perpendicular to the base 1 has a suitable effect.",
        "Although the effect of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 having the tip parts Mt of the shape 2Mt sharper than the shape 2Mb of the bottom parts Mb on the reduction of reflectance cannot clearly be explained, the effect of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 conforming to the present invention on the reduction of reflectance was proved by the computer-aided simulation of the antireflection performance of finely roughened antireflection parts respectively having different sectional shapes in a plane perpendicular to the base 1. The sectional shapes of the minute projections 2p of models of finely roughened antireflection parts used for the computer-aided simulation were those substantially resembling isosceles triangles like those shown in FIGS. 5(C), 5(D) and 5(E).",
        "Although dependent on the fineness of the finely roughened antireflection parts, the reflectance of the finely roughened antireflection part 2C shown in FIG. 5(C) is 0.8%, while the reflectance of the finely roughened antireflection part 2D shown in FIG. 2(D) is 1.1%, and the reflectance of the finely roughened antireflection part 2C is less than that of the finely roughened antireflection part 2D by 28%.",
        "FIG. 6 shows the minute projections 2p of the finely roughened antireflection parts 2C, 2D and 2E shown in FIGS. 5(C), 5(D) and 5(E) in an enlarged sectional view. In the finely roughened antireflection part 2D, the tip part Mt of the minute projection 2p and the bottom part Mb of the depression 2d have the same sharpness, and the tip 2t of the minute projection 2p and the bottom 2b of the depression 2d are connected by a straight line in a sectional shape. The width Wt of the section of the tip part Mt of the minute projection 2p of the finely roughened antireflection part 2C conforming to the present invention on a line at a level equal to H/2 is smaller than that of the section of the tip part Mt of the finely roughened antireflection part 2D on the same line. The width Wt of the section of the tip part Mt of the minute projection 2p on the line at the level equal to H/2 is greater than that of the bottom part Mb of the depression in the finely roughened antireflection part 2E where the bottom part Mb is sharper than the tip part Mt.",
        "The shape of a section of the minute projections of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 in a plane parallel to the XY-plane may be any suitable shape, such as a circular, as shown in FIG. 2, oval, triangular, square, rectangular, hexagonal or polygonal shape. The shapes of sections of each minute projection 2p in different planes parallel to the XY-plane do not need to be similar shapes.

The antireflection effect of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 shown in FIG. 7(A) is anisotropic and is dependent on the relation between the direction of extension of the ridges and furrows, and the direction of amplitude of the incident light wave. Finely roughened antireflection parts shown in FIGS. 2, 7(B) and 7(C), in which minute projections 2p are formed in a two-dimensional arrangement, are preferable because the antireflection effect of those finely roughened antireflection parts is isotropic.",

This method is suitable for forming a single antireflection structure or a small number of antireflection structures. This method takes time and increases costs when the same is applied to mass-producing antireflection structures. In view of producing antireflection structures at a high industrial productivity at low costs, it is preferable to form the finely roughened antireflection part 2 on the base 1 by a forming die.",
        "It is more preferable to use a forming die fabricated by duplicating an original forming die by a duplicating process including one or a plurality of steps of pattern transfer and inversion than using an original forming die. First an original forming die, i.e., a mother plate, is fabricated, a duplicate forming die, i.e., a master plate, is formed by duplicating the original die by a duplicating process or by repeating a duplicating process several times, and the duplicate forming die is used as a working forming die for forming finely roughened antireflection structures 2. The method using such a forming die is excellent in respect of industrial productivity and cost, because, for example, another forming die can be readily made even if the working forming die is damaged.",

A mother die making process is the first process of forming a structure for forming the finely roughened antireflection part 2. Fine processing techniques used in the semiconductor industry and including a pattern forming process that uses light, an electron beam or such for exposure. In forming a pattern on a substrate to fabricate a semiconductor device, the side walls of the component lines of the pattern may be perpendicular to the surface of the substrate and do not need to be oblique to the surface of the substrate. However, the side surfaces of the minute projections of the finely roughened antireflection part 2 of the present invention must be inclined so that the tip parts Mt of the minute projections are sharper than the bottom part Mb of the depressions.",
        "Electron lithography is an example of a fine processing technique for an exposure process. A method of fabricating a mother plate provided with finely roughened antireflection part, using electron lithography will be described. A 1100 \u212b thick chromium film is formed on a surface of a quartz glass plate. A 4000 \u212b thick resist film is formed over the chromium film by a spin-coating process. A pattern is written in the resist film for exposure by using pattern data for a pattern of 300 nm mesh by an electron beam lithograph system. A writing condition is in the range of 5 to 8 \u03bcC/cm2. The thus exposed resist film is subjected to a developing process using a developer. Thus, openings are formed in regions of the resist film specified by the writing data. Then, parts of the chromium film corresponding to the openings of the resist film are etched by a dry etching process using a chlorine etching gas to form openings corresponding to the openings of the resist film in the chromium film. A dry etching system \u201cVERSALOCK 700\u201d commercially available from Unaxis Co. may be used for the dry etching process. Then, the quartz glass plate is subjected to a dry etching process using the patterned resist film and the patterned chromium film as a mask, and fluoride gas to form a desired finely roughened shape.

        "A laser lithography system may be used instead of the electron lithography system for writing a pattern in the resist film. The laser lithography system is able to use laser interferometry, which is applied to forming holograms and diffraction gratings. Although the components of a diffraction grating are formed in a one-dimensional arrangement, components of a pattern can be formed in a two-dimensional arrangement by exposing the film to the beam at different angles by a multiple exposure method.",
        "A method of forming a mother plate using laser interferometry will be described by way of example. A resist, such as a photoresist \u201cS1805\u201d commercially available from Sipray Co., is spread by a spin-coating method on a surface of a glass plate to form a resist film. An exposure process is repeated twice to expose the resist film to a laser beam from two directions. Exposure energy in each exposure process is in the range of 80 to 200 mJ. The exposed resist film is subjected to a developing process using a 20 to 50% dilute developer prepared by diluting a developer, such as \u201cDeveloper CONC\u201d commercially available from Sipray Co. to form a mask of a pattern corresponding to a desired finely roughened antireflection shape.",

        "Generally, the minute projections of a finely roughened antireflection part 2 formed by using laser interferometry are arranged regularly. The electron beam lithography stores digital data representing pattern information about a predetermined pattern beforehand in a storage device, a scanning electron beam is controlled for on and off or the intensity of the scanning electron beam is modulated according to the pattern information. Therefore, the minute projections can be formed in either a regular arrangement or an irregular arrangement. Since the laser lithography and the electron beam lithography have both advantages and disadvantages, either the laser lithography or the electron beam lithography is used selectively taking design data, purpose, productivity and such into consideration.",

Although the performance of the antireflection structure in Comparative example 1 was satisfactory as compared with that of a structure not provided with any finely roughened antireflection part, the same was inferior to that of the antireflection structure in Example 1. A simple, transparent acrylic resin plate not finished by an antireflection process had a transmittance of 91.8% and a reflectance of 4.0%. The finely roughened antireflection part of the antireflection structure in Example 1 did not diffuse light and the transmittance was improved accordingly.",
        "The antireflection structure in Example 2 had a transmittance of 94.8% and a reflectance of 0.2%, while the antireflection structure in Comparative example 2 had a transmittance of 94.0% and a reflectance of 0.85%. Although the performance of the antireflection structure in Comparative example 2 was satisfactory as compared with that of a structure not provided with any finely roughened antireflection part, the same was inferior to that of the antireflection structure in Example 2.",
        "Thus, the finely roughened antireflection part of the antireflection structure of the present invention prevents reflection of light by the surface of an article. The shape of the finely roughened antireflection part in which the tip parts of the projections are sharper than the bottom parts of the depressions reduces reflection of light effectively. When reflection is reduced, transmittance is increased accordingly. Thus, the use of the antireflection structure as a window plate for a display unit improves the visibility of displayed pictures and improves the efficiency of display light."
