    "description": [
        "The present invention relates generally to an optical pickup apparatus having an optical detection area for compensating for tracking error and, more particularly, to an optical pickup apparatus, which performs focus/tracking servo follow-up on optical disks having different track pitches by compensating for tracking error offset attributable to the optical axis shift of an objective lens using the optical intensity distribution of the optical detection areas of an optical detection unit formed in an optical detection means.",
        "Recently, due to the trend toward voluminous data, there have been developed optical disks that allow data to be stored and read in an optical manner, that is, that allow data to be stored by enabling the light transmittance, reflectivity, phase and polarization of a data storage location to be varied, and allow data to be read by enabling the variations of data to be read using light.",
        "That is, an optical disk stores data on a circular disk, and allows data to be read by the irradiation of focused laser light thereon and the reading of the reflectivity, or the phase or polarization variations of the light at the time of reflection. The optical disk is a storage medium that allows minute pits having a light wavelength size to be formed on a disk and allows digital signals \u20181\u2019 and \u20180\u2019 according to the presence and absence of a pit to be generated, respectively.",
        "Currently, in optical disk markets, there are being quickly popularized Digital Versatile Disk (DVD) multimedia systems compatible with optical disks having different track pitches, that is, a DVD-Random Access Memory (RAM) having a track pitch of 1.23 or 1.48 \u03bcm and a DVD-Read-Only Memory (ROM)/\u00b1R/RW having a track pitch of 0.74 \u03bcm. In conjunction with this, an optical pickup apparatus are required to have the compatibility that allows data to be stored in optical disks having different track pitches or data to be read from the optical disks.",
        "The optical pickup apparatuses function to focus light without aberration on optical disks, converge light reflected by the diffractive interference of the pits of the optical disks, and convert the reflected light into electric signals so as to record and reproduce data.",
        "In the meantime, the optical pickup apparatuses perform tracking/servo follow-up by a Push-Pull method using one beam or Differential Push-Pull (DPP) method to store data on optical disks or read data stored on optical disks.",
        "Of the above-described tracking/servo follow-up methods, a Push-Pull method uses the difference in the amount of light detected by a four-segmented photo detector shown in FIG. 1 as a Tracking Error Signal (TES) that is expressed by [(a+c)\u2212(b+d)].",
        "That is, when an optical spot formed by a central beam focused on an optical disk through an objective lens and optical spots formed by both side beams accurately follow the signal tracks of the optical disk, as shown in FIG. 2, an photo detector detects a tracking error signal for the optical disk using the optical intensity distribution of four segmented areas, as shown in FIG. 3.",
        "In that case, when an optical beam focused from an objective lens follows the center of a signal track, optical intensity distribution on the optical detector is uniform and a tracking error signal calculated in terms of an electrical signal using [(a+c)\u2212(b+d)] is 0.",
        "However, in the case where light is focused from the objective lens OL onto the right side of a signal track, the optical intensity distribution of the photo detector is formed so that a large amount of light is irradiated onto the right side compared to the left side, so that a tracking error signal calculated in terms of an electric signal using [(a+c)\u2212(b+d)] has a (+) value.",
        "In contrast, in the case where light is focused from the objective lens OL onto the left side of a signal track, the optical intensity distribution of the photo detector is formed so that a large amount of light is irradiated onto the left side compared to the left side, so that a tracking error signal calculated in terms of an electric signal using [(a+c)\u2212(b+d)] has a (\u2212) value.",
        "When the tracking error signal is detected by the photo detector as described above, the optical pickup allows a light beam irradiated from the objective lens to follow the center of the signal track by operating an actuator in conjunction with the detected tracking error signal, thus performing tracking servo for the optical disk.",
        "In tracking servo follow-up for the optical disk, an optical spot focused on the track of an optical disk is required to a smaller optical intensity variation with respect to tracking shift attributable to the right and left movement of an objective lens.",
        "However, since an optical spot focused on the track of an optical disk, as shown in FIG. 4, has higher optical intensity distribution in the central region of the optical spot and lower optical intensity distribution in the side regions of the optical spot, in the case where an objective lens moves to the right or left due to the eccentricity of the optical disk, a problem arises in that a tracking error offset error occurs, thus making accurate tracking servo follow-up difficult.",
        "In the case where diffracted light reflected by an optical disk is filtered by the diameter of an objective lens even though accurate tracking follow-up has been performed on an optical disk, a problem arises in that the balance of the right and left optical intensity distribution of an optical spot is not maintained, and thus a tracking error offset, in which a tracking error signal for the optical disk is output, occurs even though accurate tracking servo follow-up is being performed.",
        "In the case of a DVD-ROM/\u00b1R/RW having a track pitch of 0.74 \u03bcm, a diffracted beam having a diffraction angle larger than an incident angle that an objective lens can accommodate is filtered out by the objective lens and only diffracted beams having 0 and \u00b11-order diffraction coefficients are incident on an optical detection means, thus forming an optical spot having a baseball shape, as shown in FIG. 5.",
        "In contrast, in the case of a DVD-RAM having a track pitch of 1.23 or 1.48 \u03bcm, the diffracted light is made to have a smaller diffraction angle by a track pitch larger than that of a DVD-ROM/\u00b1R/RW, so that the incident diffracted light is not filtered out by the objective lens, but is incident on the optical detection means.",
        "In this case, in the case where the objective lens shifts to the right or left, the lightest central beam of an optical spot formed by a diffracted beam reflected after the performance of tracking for an optical disk is moved to the right or left in conjunction with the shift of the objective lens, so that a tracking error offset signal for the optical disk is detected.",
        "That is, the central beam of the optical spot is moved in conjunction with the right or left shift of the objective lens even though tracking servo for the optical disk has been successfully performed, so that a tracking error offset signal, in which tracking servo has not been successfully performed due to the difference of the balance of optical intensity distribution, occurs, thus preventing accurate tracking servo follow-up from being performed for the optical disk.",
        "For another method for performing tracking/servo follow-up, Korean Unexamined Pat. Publication No. 2001-0098602 discloses a technical concept of detecting a tracking error signal using a DPP method.",
        "In Korean Unexamined Pat. Publication No. 2001-0098602, there is disclosed an optical pickup apparatus 1 that, as shown in FIG. 7, includes a laser source 2 generating a light beam B, a diffracting means 3 diffracting the light beam B emitted from the laser source 2, a beam splitter 4 transmitting the light beam B or reflecting the light beam B in a specific direction, a collimator lens 5 forming the parallel flux of light, an objective lens 7 focusing the light beam B on the signal surface of an optical disk 6, and a photo detector 8 receiving light returning from the optical disk 6.",
        "The photo detector 8 constituting a part of the optical pickup 1, as shown in FIG. 8, is formed of a main photo detector 8a and two side photo detectors 8b. The main photo detector 8a is segmented into four units lengthwise and breadthwise and receives a main spot MS, and each of the side photo detectors 8b is segmented into two units breadthwise and receives a side spot SS.",
        "In this case, the output signals of the units are indicated by A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H, respectively. A tracking error signal is generated from an output obtained by calculation between the output signals of the photo detectors 8a and 8b.",
        "The main photo detector has four light receiving units lengthwise and breadthwise, and each of the side detectors has two light receiving units breadthwise. Separate push-pull signals are generated by the respective photo detectors, a tracking error signal is generated from an output obtained by calculation between the Push-Pull signals, and DC offset amounts occurring in the Push-Pull signals in the photo detectors are cancelled for the Push-Pull signals. As a result, even though the DC offset amounts of signals SSP1 and SSP2 are different, it is possible without using a calculation equation to prevent an offset amount from occurring in the Push-Pull signal. Accordingly, it is possible to perform high precision tracking servo, and high-density recording can be implemented.",
        "However, the above-described DPP method has disadvantages in that it is difficult to apply the DPP method to optical disks having different sizes because the DPP method requires accuracy to locate an auxiliary beam on the boundary of a track, and it is impossible to perform servo because a tracking error signal is considerably reduced when disks having different track pitches are read.",
        "That is, when the locations of side beams are adjusted on a single type of disks, the central and side beams of diffracted light, as shown in FIG. 3, are focused on the center of a track, so that it is possible to detect a tracking/focus error signal using a conventional astigmatic detection method or the conventional DPP method.",
        "However, in the case where disks having different track pitches are read, a problem arises in that it is possible to detect a focus error signal using the conventional astigmatic detection method, but it is impossible to detect a tracking error signal using the conventional DPP method because side beams are not focused on the center of a track.",
        "Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide an optical pickup apparatus, which is capable of detecting a tracking error for a DVD-RAM by adjusting the angles of auxiliary beams so as to use a conventional DPP method, and detecting a tracking error for a DVD-ROM/\u00b1R/RW by compensating for tracking error offset attributable to the optical axis shift of an objective lens using optical intensity distribution formed on the specific optical detection areas of an optical detection unit on which the tracking error signal is not formed.",
        "In order to accomplish the above object, the present invention provides an optical pickup apparatus, including a light emitting means for emitting a single beam that will be focused on a track of optical disks having different track pitches; an optical means for diffracting the single beam, focusing the optical spot of the diffracted beam having a specific diffraction coefficient on the track, and transmitting the diffracted beam, which is reflected by the track, to an outside; and an optical detection means including a first optical detection unit on which a central beam having a 0-order diffraction coefficient is focused, and second and third optical detection units on which side beams having \u00b11 diffraction coefficients are focused, respectively, each of the optical detection units being segmented into a specific number of optical detection areas, at least one of the optical detection units being provided with an optical detection area on which a tracking error signal used to compensate for tracking error offset attributable to optical axis shift of an objective lens is not formed.",

In particular, the diffraction plate 210 is a grating.",
        "The beam splitter 220 allows linearly polarized laser light, which has a specific diffraction coefficient and is incident from the diffraction plate 210, to branch off to the direction of the optical disk 400.",
        "Furthermore, the beam splitter 220 also functions to receive laser light reflected by the optical disk, and allows the laser light to branch off to the direction of an optical detection means (will be described later) so as to perform tracking/servo follow-up on the optical disk 400.",
        "The collimator lens 230 converts linearly polarized laser light, which has a specific diffraction coefficient, is allowed to branch off by the beam splitter 220 and is incident from the beam splitter 220, into parallel light, and allows the parallel light to be incident on the quarter wave plate 240.",

        "The objective lens 250 focuses laser light, which is incident from the quarter wave plate 240, on a track of the optical disk 400 storing specific image and voice data, in more detail, a DVD-RAM having a track pitch of 1.23 or 1.48 \u03bcm or DVD-ROM/\u00b1R/RW having a track pitch of 0.74 \u03bcm.",
