The disclosed invention first obtains a corrected received signal using the received signal and a pre-estimated timing offset. The pre-estimated timing offset is further tracked in two steps. In the first step a plurality of probable deviations in the pre-estimated timing offset are considered. Then a training sequence is used to determine an expected signal corresponding to each of the probable deviations. The corrected received signal is then shifted through the probable deviations. Thereafter error factor between the expected signals and corresponding shifted received signals is obtained. The probable deviation yielding optimum error factor is then identified as the first estimate of the deviation in timing offset. This first estimate is then refined using correlation techniques to obtain an improved estimate of the deviation.",

        "The present invention relates to the field of timing offset estimation in wireless networks. More particularly, the invention relates to a method and system for data-aided timing offset estimation for frequency selective fading channels.",
        "In wireless communication, a timing offset is experienced between received and transmitted signals. The timing offset is caused by a number of distortions experienced in the channel due to factors such as multipath effects, frequency selective fading and unknown propagation delays. These timing offsets lead to errors in the channel response estimation and a consequent increase in the overall bit error rate (BER). Thus, timing offset estimation is an important aspect of wireless communication receivers.",
        "Various approaches addressing the problem of timing offset estimation are known in the art. These approaches can be broadly classified into two categories\u2014data-aided and non data-aided approaches. In a data-aided approach, a predefined sequence of symbols is embedded in the transmitted signal to aid the timing offset estimation. The sequence is known as a training sequence. The receiver has prior knowledge of the training sequence. It thus compares the known training sequence with the received training sequence for estimating the timing offset. In a non data-aided approach, use of such a training sequence is avoided, and the receiver achieves synchronization by extracting the information necessary for timing offset estimation from the modulated signal. The data throughput efficiency of data-aided approaches is lower than that of non data-aided approaches as a certain portion of the transmitted signal is assigned to the predefined sequence. However, the time taken for achieving synchronization in data-aided methods is significantly less than non-data aided methods. As the data rates provided by mobile devices are increasing, it has become essential to achieve faster synchronization. Therefore data-aided methods are preferred for use with mobile devices. Consequently, most wireless communication standards, such as the Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), provide a training sequence in the transmitted signal to facilitate data-aided timing offset estimation. Further many of these standards perform the timing offset estimation in two stages\u2014acquisition and tracking. The first occurrence of the training sequence in the received signal is used to obtain an estimate of the timing offset during acquisition. Thereafter, in the tracking stage, the change in this estimate is tracked at subsequent occurrences of the training sequence to account for the time varying characteristic of the channel.",
        "One approach of timing offset estimation is proposed in a research paper titled \u201cA Fully Digital Feed forward MSK Demodulator with Joint Frequency Offset and Symbol Timing Estimation for Burst Mode Mobile Radio\u201d, authored by Ralph Mehlan, Yong-En Chen and Heinrich Meyr, published in IEEE Transactions, Vehicular Technology, VOL 42, No.4, November 1993 Pages 434-443. The method proposed in the publication uses a differential phase technique for estimating the timing offset for minimum shift keying (MSK) modulated signals subjected to flat fading in the channel. However, the method is non data-aided and does not consider frequency selective fading in the channel.",
        "A data-aided method for timing offset estimation is proposed in the research paper \u201cA Fully Digital Noncoherent and coherent GMSK Receiver Architecture with Joint Symbol Timing Error and Frequency Offset Estimation\u201d, authored by Yung-liang Huang, Kong-Dar Fan and Chia-Chi Huang, published in IEEE Trans, Vehicular Technology, VOL.49, No 3, May 2000 pages 863-874. In accordance with this method, the received signal is first passed through a frequency discriminator. The frequency discriminator outputs a frequency discriminated signal whose instantaneous amplitude is proportional to the instantaneous frequency of the received signal. Thereafter, the frequency offset is estimated using the training sequence and the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the frequency discriminated signal. The estimated frequency offset is then used to find a timing offset estimate. Although the method is a data-aided one, it does not consider the multipath effects of the channel.",
        "In order to consider the multipath effects of the channel, data-aided methods use a correlation between the known training sequence and received signal for estimating the timing offset. Correlation-based techniques correlate the training sequence with the received signal shifted through various probable timing offsets and find out the offset value resulting in the maximum correlation. The maximum correlation point corresponds to the strongest multipath location. Thus the correlation-based techniques rely on the strongest multipath location and are suitable for use in a flat fading multipath channel environment.",
        "A correlation based data-aided timing offset synchronization approach is proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,373,858 titled \u201cMethod and Apparatus of Adaptive Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation Using Filtered Correlation Synchronization\u201d and assigned to Hughes Electronics Corporation, El Segundo, Calif. The patent discloses a signal structure with a reference data burst (training sequence) embedded in it for timing and frequency offset estimation. The patent further proposes a correlation-based method of timing synchronization using the proposed signal structure. In accordance with the method, a burst detector determines an occurrence of a reference data burst in the received signals. A first estimate of the frequency and timing offset is obtained using the detected burst. Thereafter, the correlation value between the first estimate of the frequency offset and its neighbors is interpolated assuming the timing offset to be equal to the first estimate of timing offset. The interpolation is used to obtain a fine estimate of the frequency offset. This fine estimate of the frequency offset is used to correct the received signal. The frequency corrected received signal is used to refine the estimate of the timing offset. Thus the timing offset estimate is used to refine the frequency offset and vice-versa.",
        "The correlation-based data-aided method presented in U.S. Pat. No. 6,373,858 as discussed above relies on the strongest multipath location computed using correlation properties of the training sequence. In conditions with low signal to noise ratio, autocorrelation of these training sequences may be low. Also, the cross correlation of the training sequence with the data adjacent to the training sequence may be high. The problem is aggravated when the training sequences are short. For example, the training sequence provided by GSM systems for tracking are only 26-bits long. Considering the above facts, relying solely on correlation techniques for timing offset estimation does not achieve accurate results. Additionally, in frequency selective multipath conditions, the performance of equalizer depends on the exact knowledge of the delay profile rather than the strongest multipath location information. Consequently, various methods using the channel characteristic estimate for timing offset estimation have been developed.",
        "One such method is disclosed in European Patent Application No. EP1292063A1 titled \u201cFrame Synchronization Apparatus and Frame Synchronization Method\u201d and assigned to Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. The method disclosed in the above patent application considers a channel environment in which the level fluctuation, noise, or delay wave occurring due to fading fluctuations, are assumed to be absent. Thereafter, a predetermined known signal, i.e. the training sequence, is filtered through the considered channel to obtain a filtered signal. An ideal correlation value is calculated between the filtered signal and the predetermined known signal. The ideal correlation value is then time shifted through a predetermined shifting time. Additionally, an actual correlation value is obtained between the received signal and the predetermined known signal. The actual correlation value is further multiplied by a magnification factor. Then the square error between the shifted ideal correlation value and the magnified actual correlation value is found out. The shifting time corresponding to ideal correlation value at which the calculated square error is minimum is identified as the synchronization time, i.e. the timing offset.",
        "The above method uses the channel transfer function for estimating the timing offset but assumes the channel transfer function to be constant over time. However, this assumption leads to inaccuracies in timing offset estimate as the actual channel characteristics vary with time. Various methods of obtaining dynamic channel estimate are known in the art. One such method, which obtains the channel dynamically and uses it for demodulation of the received signal, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,363,412 titled \u201cMethod and Apparatus of Adaptive Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation Using Filtered Correlation Synchronization\u201d, assigned to Motorola Inc., Schaumburg, Ill. The method described in the above patent uses the correlation between the received signal and the known transmitted signal to obtain an initial estimate of the timing offset and the channel transfer function. A Viterbi decoder then uses these initial estimates to decode the received signal. Thereafter, the decoded signal is filtered through the estimated channel to obtain an estimated channel-impaired signal. The error between the estimated channel-impaired signal and the received signal is then used to improve the channel estimate. The improved channel estimate is then used for demodulating the received signal. Even though the method estimates the channel dynamically, it obtains the timing offset using correlation techniques and does not use the dynamically calculated channel for timing offset estimation.",
        "A method using dynamic channel estimation for timing offset estimation is described in WIPO Patent Application No. 0243271A2 titled \u201cJoint Least-Square Synchronization, Channel Estimation and Noise Estimation\u201d and assigned to Telefonaktiebolaget Lm Ericsson (Publ), Sweden. In accordance with the method disclosed in the above patent, a training sequence is received and the symbols in the received signal are divided into groups. For each of these groups, a set of linear equations is established. These equations estimate the channel using a least square error technique. The least square estimate thus calculated is used to determine a noise estimate for each group. The group having the least noise estimate is chosen as the synchronization group. Alternatively, the group with greatest signal to noise ratio can be selected as the synchronization group. The method performs dynamic channel estimation by calculating the least square error between the received and reference signal and use the channel estimate for achieving timing offset estimation. This makes the method suitable for frequency selective fading conditions. However, calculation of dynamic channel transfer function for a plurality of symbol groups is a computationally complex task. Therefore the method requires high processing power for execution. Mobile devices have limited processing resources. As a result, such computationally complex methods are not suitable for use with wireless receivers in mobile devices.",
        "From the discussion of the prior art above, it is evident that the correlation-based methods of timing offset estimation known in the art rely on the estimation of the strongest multipath location. However, the knowledge of the channel's delay profile is required to accurately determine the timing offset in frequency selective fading channels. Furthermore, the delay profile or the channel characteristics do not remain constant over time. Dynamic determination of the delay profile or channel characteristics is a computationally complex task. As a result the methods using dynamic channel characteristics require high processing power. Therefore there exists a need for an approach providing the high accuracy attained by dynamic channel estimation while still retaining the computational efficiency of correlation based techniques.",

The synchronization point is defined with respect to the performance of the equalizer rather than based on the strongest multipath location (Conventional method). A point is chosen so as to capture as much multipath profile as possible to have efficient equalization.",

The disclosed invention first obtains a corrected received signal by shifting a received signal by a pre-estimated timing offset. The disclosed invention further tracks the pre-estimated timing offset in two steps: a coarse estimation step and a refinement step. In the coarse estimation step, a first estimate of the deviation in the pre-estimated timing offset is selected out of a plurality of probable deviations using an error factor corresponding to each probable deviation. The error factor corresponding to a probable deviation is a measure of the closeness between the corrected received signal shifted through the probable deviation and an expected signal corresponding to the probable deviation. The expected signal is calculated using an estimate of the channel and the training sequence. The deviation yielding the optimum value of the error factor is selected as the first estimate of the deviation in the pre-estimated timing offset. In the refinement step, a set of closely spaced probable deviations in the proximity of the first estimate is considered. Thereafter, the correlation values between the training sequence and the corrected received signal shifted through each of the closely spaced deviations are determined. The closely spaced deviation yielding the maximum of correlation peaks is identified as the improved estimate of the deviation in timing offset.",

Further, as the estimation of the channel is a computationally complex task, the disclosed invention uses the channel estimation only for coarsely estimating of the timing offset. The coarse estimate of the timing offset is then refined using a computationally efficient synchronization technique.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 1A, a data-aided method of tracking the timing offset in accordance with the disclosed invention is hereinafter described. The method of obtaining a timing offset estimate at an occurrence of the training sequence is first described. At step 102, the received signal is first shifted through the pre-estimated timing offset to obtain a corrected received signal r(n), where n denotes the discrete time instant under consideration. The method uses the timing offset value tracked at the previous occurrence of the training sequence as a pre-estimate of the timing offset. Alternatively, the method uses the timing offset estimate obtained during acquisition as the pre-estimate of the timing offset. The disclosed invention then accomplishes the task of tracking the pre-estimated timing offset using the corrected received signal in the following two steps. At the first step 104, a plurality of probable deviations m in the pre-estimated timing offset is considered and one of the probable deviations is identified as a first estimate of the deviation in timing offset mopt. The plurality of probable deviations is contained in a possible range of values [\u2212M,M]. To illustrate the disclosed invention with an example it is assumed that the probable deviations are spaced regularly in the above-mentioned range. Step 104 of obtaining a first estimate of the deviation is further explained with reference to FIG. 1B. Once a first estimate of the deviation is obtained, an improved estimate of the deviation is determined using the first estimate of the deviation at step 106. The step 106 of obtaining an improved estimate of the deviation is further explained with reference to FIG. 5.",
        "Referring now primarily to FIG. 1B, a method of obtaining the first estimate of the deviation in accordance with the disclosed invention is hereinafter described. The method involves considering a plurality of probable deviations [\u2212M, M]. At step 108, an expected signal {circumflex over (r)}i(n) corresponding to a considered probable deviation m is obtained using a training sequence Itr(n) and a channel estimate \u0125m(n). The expected signal {circumflex over (r)}m(n) is the signal that should ideally be received if the deviation in timing offset is equal to the considered probable deviation m. The step 108 of obtaining expected signal {circumflex over (r)}m(n) is explained in detail with reference to FIG. 3A. Thereafter, an error factor E(m) between expected signal {circumflex over (r)}m(n) and the shifted received signal r(n\u2212m) is obtained at step 110, wherein r(n\u2212m) denotes the received signal r(n) shifted by the considered probable deviation m. Error factor E(m) is a measure of closeness between these two signals. Hence, an optimal value of the error factor corresponds to the best estimate of the actual deviation in timing offset. In an embodiment of the disclosed invention, the square error between shifted received signal r(n\u2212m) and expected signal {circumflex over (r)}m(n) is used as the error factor. This embodiment is further explained with reference to equation (1). The steps 108 and 110 are repeated for each of the probable deviations m\u03b5[\u2212M, M].

        "Referring now primarily to FIG. 5 a method of obtaining the improved estimate mrefined of the deviation in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosed invention is hereinafter described. After first estimate of the deviation mopt is obtained in step 104, a plurality of closely spaced probable deviations in the pre-estimated timing offset are considered in the proximity of first estimate mopt. Corrected received signal r(n) is then shifted through each of the closely spaced probable deviations to obtain a plurality of closely shifted received signals. Thereafter at step 502, correlations between each of the closely shifted received signals and training sequence Itr(n) is determined for each of the closely spaced probable deviations. The closely spaced probable deviation that yields maximum of correlation peaks is identified as the improved estimate mrefined of the deviation at step 504. The closely spaced probable deviations are chosen depending on the accuracy desired for improved estimate mrefined. For example, an accuracy of \u00bdQ is attained by performing the step of fine estimation at an over sampling rate of Q i.e. by choosing the closely spaced probable deviations at an interval of 1/Q. The above-mentioned method of obtaining an improved estimate of the deviation is described for illustrating the disclosed invention and in no way limit the scope of the invention, which can be implemented with any other computationally efficient method of timing offset estimation. In an alternative embodiment least square error, least mean square error and recursive least square error techniques can be optionally used for obtaining the improved estimate of the timing offset.",

The calculation of channel transfer function in the timing offset estimation process results in high accuracy in frequency selective fading conditions.

The first step estimates the timing offset using the channel transfer function while the second step uses the relatively faster correlation technique. The interval between the probable timing offsets used in first step can be chosen depending on the desired accuracy level and available processing resources. For example, in a GSM receiver timing offset estimate at an accuracy of \u00b1\u00bd symbol can be carried out in the first step while achieving finer estimation in the relatively faster second step. Thus, the disclosed invention achieves a high level of accuracy in timing offset estimation while still retaining computational efficiency.",
