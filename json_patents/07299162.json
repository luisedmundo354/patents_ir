Generally, the expected length of the operational life is known only approximately and, not untypically, premature failure is a possibility. Simple running time criteria are typically inadequate to provide timely indication of an incipient failure. In some applications, unanticipated failure of devices constitutes a at least a nuisance; however, more typically, unanticipated device failure may be a major nuisance leading to costly interruption of services and production. In other cases, such unexpected failure can seriously compromise safety and may result in potentially dangerous and life-threatening situations.",

The example used is also appropriate in that an unexpected failure of such an X-ray tube, for example during a critical surgical procedure, should be avoided insofar as is possible.",

The individual scalars xi could be any quantity affecting the rate of wear or ageing of the device, including directly measured physical quantities such as temperature or voltage or composite functions thereof such as, for example, power (product of voltage and current) or temperature difference, or e.g. control parameters such as load settings and time of operation. The choice of both the number d and kind of variables, which usually is only a small subset of available measurements, can be done following existing variable selection to techniques. In the X-ray tube case, it turns out to have been possible to perform an exhaustive search, which selected the d unique scalars that minimized the cross validation (CV) error as will be explained in more detail below.",

        "Ideally, the virtual ages for each device would be normalized to the same value, say 1 (one).

The additional term involving \u03bb, is intended to improve the generalizability and avoid over fitting. This technique is referred to as ridge regression in the literature. The parameter \u03bb should be optimized via cross validation. The matrix B is positive definite and for the X-ray tubes was taken to be the identity matrix.",

        "After determining the coefficients a for the N devices in the training set, it is proposed in accordance with the embodiment of the invention to estimate the remaining lifetime of devices in the same family by computing the incremental (and resulting cumulative) wear according to equation (2). Since the virtual age was normalized to one (1), the cumulative wear directly yields the fractional life that has elapsed.",
        "The applicability of the principles of cross correlation in the context of the present invention is next addressed. K-fold cross validation is a well known technique to estimate the test error of a predictor if the available data set (size n) is too small to allow the split into training and test sets. Instead, we iterate the splitting process by dividing the data into a \u201csmall\u201d part of k elements and use the remaining n-k elements for training. The test errors on the small k-set are then averaged to yield the k-fold cross validation error. In the X-ray tube example, the data set comprised approximately 70 tubes (n\u02dc70) and we chose k\u02dc1-5.",
        "It will be understood that the invention may be implemented in a number of ways, utilizing available hardware and software technologies. Implementation by way of a programmable digital computer is suitable, with or without the addition of supplemental apparatus. A dedicated system may also be used, with a dedicated programmed computer and appropriate peripheral equipment. When various functions and subfunctions are implemented in software, subsequent changes and improvements to the operation are readily implemented.",
        "While the present invention has been described by way of illustrative embodiments, it will be understood by one of skill in the art to which it pertains that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. Such changes and modifications are intended to be within the scope of the claims following."
