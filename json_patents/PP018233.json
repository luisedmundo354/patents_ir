        "The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of a suffrutescent perennial, Penstemon hybrid, and is given the cultivar name, \u2018Crushed Grapes\u2019. Penstemon are in the family Scrophulariaceae. This new cultivar which originated as an open pollinated seedling from Penstemon \u2018Sweet Grapes\u2019 (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 13,549) progeny. Selections had been made yearly to improve the habit by making it more compact as well as to increase the bloom number, the number of inflorescences, and to reduce the height of the flower stalks.",
        "This new cultivar is characterized by:\n\n    \n    \n        1) Deep purple flowers.\n        2) High flower number on a tight inflorescence.\n        3) Persistent basal foliage with a compact habit.\n        4) Numerous short flowering stalks.",
        "This new cultivar has been reproduced only by asexual propagation (cuttings). Each of the progeny exhibits identical characteristics to the original plant. Asexual propagation by tip cuttings using standard propagation techniques with terminal and lateral shoots as done in Canby, Oreg., shows that the foregoing characteristics and distinctions come true to form and are established and transmitted through succeeding propagations. The present invention has not been evaluated under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary with variations in environment without a change in the genotype of the plant.",
