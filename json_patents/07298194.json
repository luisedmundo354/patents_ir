    "description": [
        "This invention relates to interpolation and more particularly to an interpolator structure suitable for fabrication as part of an integrated circuit. The invention relates more particularly still to the generation of steering currents required to move the operating point of the interpolator are around the phase circle.",
        "The present invention provides a steering current generator as defined in the appended claims.",
        "There will now be described an example of the invention, with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which:",
        "FIG. 1 is a circuit diagram of a phase interpolator.",
        "FIG. 2 is a steering current generator according to the invention.",
        "FIG. 3 is diagram plotting the outputs of the current generator.",
        "A schematic of the structure of an interpolator is shown in FIG. 1. For more details of the operation and function of such a circuit the reader is referred to the applicant's co-pending application filed on even date under the designation TI-38552, U.S. application Ser. No. 11/150,902, which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "It will be observed that the interpolator has a four stage structure and that each stage is biased by a current mirror, such as current mirror 11. The presence of the current mirror enables the stage to be controlled by a steering currents I0, I1, I2, I3 and the generation of such a steering current will now be considered in more detail.",
        "A steering current generator 20 is shown in FIG. 2. The required resultant current is generated by summing a number of currents generated and controlled within the circuit. Sub-circuit 21 may for example be controlled by differential inputs PS and PSZ to sum current into the summing node of switching circuit stages B0 and B1 respectively (i.e. stages 23 and 26). In an exemplary embodiment of the current steering control arrangement, there are 31 instances of circuit block 21, receiving 31 separate single bit inputs such that each of the transistors within the instances of the circuit maybe individually controlled to supply current to either stage B0, B1 in accordance with the single bit inputs. Note that since the PS<i> is the inverse of PSZ<i> the total current provided to the stages B0 and B1 is a constant, namely 31 times lb.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 3, assume that the interpolator is operating at operating point 31, equivalent to a PS input of 0; i.e. 31 bits each with a value of 0. The operating point may be stepped by gradually increasing the number of bits set and eventually the operating point reaches 32, where all 31 bits have the logic value of 1.",
        "Thus far, the operating point of the interpolator has been restricted to a first quadrant of operation 30. The operating quadrant is defined by a two bit code (QS), which in the first quadrant 30 has the value 00. In that quadrant the control signals QS cause the current summed from the circuit blocks 21 to form currents IB0 and IB1. Those currents also comprise an additional unit of lb. provided by a current source 28, 29 respective to each of the stages 23 and 26. These currents IB0 and IB1 are mirrored into the interpolator of FIG. 1 as mentioned above.",
        "In the circuit implementation (FIG. 2) the QS inputs, also control further the stages of the circuit, such as stages 22 and 27 (stages B2 and B3) and are input to one of two coupled transistors in each stage, such as input 24.",
        "In quadrant 00 stages B2 and B3 do not receive any current from the circuit blocks 21 but only units of \u00bd lb. from respective current sources, which currents respectively form currents IB2 and IB3, which are mirrored into other stages of the interpolator.",
        "Stages B2 and B0 are cross coupled together, and stages B1 and B3 likewise. Each of the stages are fed from a different leg of the single bit driven circuits, 21. (B2 and B0 from one leg and B1 and B3 from the other.) Moving the operating point to the first point of the second quadrant 35 is achieved by altering the QS Code from the value 00 to the value 01. This switches the current from circuit blocks 21 from contributing to IB0 to contributing to IB2, and IB0 becomes \u00bd lb. It is not necessary to alter the individual bit codes applied to the circuit blocks 21.",
        "The operating point may then be stepped through the second quadrant, 35 by stepwise reduction of the number of set bits applied to the circuits 21, eventually reaching operating point 34, which corresponds to the all zeros input condition.",
        "In FIG. 3, the operating point of the current generator is illustrated by the current summation of (IB0-IB2) as the x-axis and (IB1-IB3) as the y-axis. In the circuit of FIG. 1, however, of course, IB0 IB1, IB2, IB3 control the four stages individually and respectively, but the angular position of the spots in the diagram about the origin nonetheless also represent the phase of the signal output by the interpolator.",
        "A number of advantages of the circuit has thus far described will be apparent.",
        "Firstly, the circuit is fully differential.",
        "The quadrant selection code is intrinsically, Gray-coded, it and since the single bit values for operating points, which our neighbours across the reference phase boundaries such as points 32 and 33 are the same, by virtue of the Gray-code only a single bit change in the entire circuit is required to cross the reference phase boundary, for example from the first sector quadrant 30 the second quadrant 35. It will be appreciated that the entire phase wheel, may be transitioned by changing a single bit at a time.",
        "It will be noted that the bleed current applied to stage 22 is in magnitude of one half different to that applied to circuit portion 23. In this way, when the circuit switches quadrants, a full step value is achieved by switching from for example \u2212\u00bd lb. to +\u00bd lb. By virtue of this arrangement the output of the interpolator is never derived from a single reference phase. This has the important consequence that the current in any of the stages is never reduced to zero.",
        "In particular embodiments, it may be found that other bleed current combinations are advantageous for example, 7\u00bd for circuit 22 and 8 for circuit 23.",
        "Note also that the architecture of the interpolator of FIG. 1 allows other numbers of reference phases and respective circuit stages therefor, from a minimum of three. Versions of the steering current generator comprise two summing nodes and sector switches that direct the currents from the circuit blocks 21 to the two active circuit stages of the circuit of FIG. 1. (\u201cSector\u201d has been used since there may be a number of \u201cquadrants\u201d unequal to four.) Bleed currents (e.g. \u00bd lb.) are switched to the remaining circuit stages.",
        "While the invention has been shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it is well understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made in the invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims."
