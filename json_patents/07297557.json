    "abstract": "A method of attaching a molecular layer to a substrate includes attaching a temporary protecting group(s) to a molecule having a molecular switching moiety with first and second connecting groups attached to opposed ends thereof. The temporary protecting group(s) is attached to the first and/or second connecting group so as to cause the opposed ends of the switching moiety to exhibit a difference in hydrophilicity such that one of the ends remains at at least one of a water/solvent interface and a water/air interface, and the other end remains in air during a Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) process. An LB film is formed on the interface. The temporary protecting group(s) is removed. The substrate is passed through the LB film to form the molecular layer chemically bonded on the substrate. The difference in hydrophilicity between the opposed ends causes formation of a substantially well-oriented, uniform LB film at the interface.",

        "The present disclosure relates generally to molecular electronics, and more particularly to molecular layers formed using Langmuir-Blodgett methods.",
        "Molecular devices having two electrodes (for example, a bottom electrode and a top electrode) and a molecular switching layer or film at the junction of the two electrodes are known. Such devices may be useful, for example, in the fabrication of devices based on electrical switching, such as molecular wire crossbar interconnects for signal routing and communications, molecular wire crossbar memory, molecular wire crossbar logic employing programmable logic arrays, multiplexers or demultiplexers for molecular wire crossbar networks, molecular wire transistors, and the like. Such devices may further be useful, for example, in the fabrication of devices based on optical switching, such as displays, electronic books, rewritable media, electrically tunable optical lenses, electrically controlled tinting for windows and mirrors, optical crossbar switches (for example, for routing signals from one of many incoming channels to one of many outgoing channels), and the like.",
        "Typically, the molecular switching layer or film has an organic molecule that, in the presence of an electrical (E) field, switches between two or more energetic states, such as by an electro-chemical oxidation or reduction (redox) reaction or by a change in the band gap of the molecule induced by the applied E-field.",
        "It is important to form a good electrical contact between the electrode and the molecular switching layer in order to fabricate operative molecular devices. Molecules with special chemical end groups are able to form direct chemical bonds with metal or semiconductor electrodes to form a self-assembled monolayer (SAM), which may have a good electrical contact with an electrode(s). However, this self-assembled molecular layer formed on the surface of the electrode may generally be prone to a high density of defects. If a second electrode is formed on the molecular layer, then an electrical short may occur between the first and second electrode through the defects in the self-assembled molecular layer.",
        "The formation of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) layers or films employing switching molecules has been attempted because such layers or films are generally much denser than SAM films. Further, LB layers or films have relatively low defect densities compared to SAM films. However, it has proven to be a significant challenge to effectively bond LB films to the electrode substrate. As such, if the LB film is not sufficiently bonded to the electrode(s), then poor electrical contact may result.",
        "As such, there is a need for providing a high density molecular switching layer on an electrode(s), which layer also bonds well with the electrode.",
        "A method of attaching a molecular layer to a substrate includes attaching at least one temporary protecting group to a molecule having a molecular switching moiety, the switching moiety having first and second connecting groups attached to opposed ends of the moiety. The temporary protecting group(s) is attached to at least one of the first and second connecting groups so as to cause the opposed ends of the switching moiety to exhibit a difference in hydrophilicity such that one of the ends remains at at least one of a water/solvent interface and a water/air interface, and the other end remains in air during a Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) process. An LB film of the molecule is formed on the at least one of the water/solvent interface and the water/air interface. The temporary protecting group(s) is removed. The substrate is passed through the Langmuir-Blodgett film to form the molecular layer chemically bonded on the substrate. The difference in hydrophilicity between the opposed ends of the switching moiety causes formation of a substantially well-oriented, uniform LB film at the at least one of the water/solvent interface and the water/air interface.",
        "Objects, features and advantages will become apparent by reference to the following detailed description and drawings, in which like reference numerals correspond to similar, though not necessarily identical components. For the sake of brevity, reference numerals having a previously described function may not necessarily be described in connection with subsequent drawings in which they appear.",
        "FIG. 1A is a schematic representation of two crossed wires, with at least one molecule at the intersection of the two wires;",
        "FIG. 1B is a perspective elevational view, depicting the crossed-wire device shown in FIG. 1a;",
        "FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of a two-dimensional array of switches, depicting a 6\u00d76 crossbar switch;",

        "FIG. 6 is similar to FIG. 3, but depicts still a further alternate embodiment of a method of the present invention.",
        "Embodiments of the present invention advantageously use a novel concept of hydrophilicity modification. This concept takes advantage of the advantageous qualities of self-assembly techniques (e.g. good electrical contact due to chemical bonding) and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) deposition (e.g. low defect density). The concept further substantially eliminates problems that may in some instances be associated with both methods. The method according to embodiments of the present invention provides a good Langmuir-Blodgett film(s), orienting the connecting groups at the ends of the molecule forming the film(s), such that chemical bonding and the formation of good electrical contact with the crossbar electrodes at either end of the molecule is promoted (described in further detail below, also for example with reference to FIGS. 4-6).",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 1A-1B, a crossed wire switching device 10 includes two wires 12, 14, each either a metal and/or semiconductor wire, that are crossed at some substantially non-zero angle. Disposed between wires 12, 14 is a layer 16 of molecules or molecular compounds, denoted R. The particular molecules 18 that are sandwiched at the intersection (also interchangeably referred to herein as a junction) of the two wires 12, 14 are identified as switch molecules Rs.",
        "There are generally two primary methods of operating such switches 10, depending on the nature of the switch molecules 18. The molecular switching layer 16 includes a switch molecule 18 (for example, an organic molecule) that, in the presence of an electrical (E) field, switches between two or more energetic states, such as by an electrochemical oxidation or reduction (redox) reaction or by a change in the band gap of the molecule induced by the applied E-field.",
        "In the former case, when an appropriate voltage is applied across the wires 12, 14, the switch molecules RS are either oxidized or reduced. When a molecule is oxidized (reduced), then a second species is reduced (oxidized) so that charge is balanced. These two species are then called a redox pair. One example of this device would be for one molecule to be reduced, and then a second molecule (the other half of the redox pair) would be oxidized. In another example, a molecule is reduced, and one of the wires 12, 14 is oxidized. In a third example, a molecule is oxidized, and one of the wires 12, 14 is reduced. In a fourth example, one wire 12, 14 is oxidized, and an oxide associated with the other wire 14, 12 is reduced. In such cases, oxidation or reduction may affect the tunneling distance or the tunneling barrier height between the two wires, thereby exponentially altering the rate of charge transport across the wire junction, and serving as the basis for a switch. Examples of molecules 18 that exhibit such redox behavior include rotaxanes, pseudo-rotaxanes, and catenanes; see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,459,095, entitled \u201cChemically Synthesized and Assembled Electronic Devices\u201d, issued Oct. 1, 2002, to James R. Heath et al, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
        "Further, the wires 12, 14 may be modulation-doped by coating their surfaces with appropriate molecules\u2014either electron-withdrawing groups (Lewis acids, such as boron trifluoride (BF3)) or electron-donating groups (Lewis bases, such as alkylamines) to make them p-type or n-type conductors, respectively. FIG. 1B depicts a coating 20 on wire 12 and a coating 22 on wire 14. The coatings 20, 22 may be modulation-doping coatings, tunneling barriers (e.g., oxides), or other nano-scale functionally suitable materials. Alternatively, the wires 12, 14 themselves may be coated with one or more R species 16, and where the wires cross, Rs 18 is formed. Or yet alternatively, the wires 12, 14 may be coated with molecular species 20, 22, respectively, for example, that enable one or both wires to be suspended to form colloidal suspensions, as discussed below. Details of such coatings are provided in above-referenced U.S. Pat. No. 6,459,095.",
        "In the latter case, examples of molecule 18 based on field induced changes include E-field induced band gap changes, such as disclosed and claimed in patent application Ser. No. 09/823,195, filed Mar. 29, 2001, published as Publication No. 2002/0176276 on Nov. 28, 2002, which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Examples of molecules used in the E-field induced band gap change approach include molecules that evidence molecular conformation change or an isomerization; change of extended conjugation via chemical bonding change to change the band gap; or molecular folding or stretching.",
        "Changing of extended conjugation via chemical bonding change to change the band gap may be accomplished in one of the following ways: charge separation or recombination accompanied by increasing or decreasing band localization; or change of extended conjugation via charge separation or recombination and \u03c0-bond breaking or formation.",
        "The formation of micrometer scale and nanometer scale crossed wire switches 10 uses either a reduction or oxidation (redox) reaction to form an electrochemical cell or uses E-field induced band gap changes to form molecular switches. In either case, the molecular switches typically have two states, and may be either irreversibly switched from a first state to a second state or reversibly switched from a first state to a second state. In the latter case, there are two possible conditions: either the electric field may be removed after switching into a given state, and the molecule will remain in that state (\u201clatched\u201d) until a reverse field is applied to switch the molecule back to its previous state; or removal of the electric field causes the molecule to revert to its previous state, and hence the field must be maintained in order to keep the molecule in the switched state until it is desired to switch the molecule to its previous state.",
        "Color switch molecular analogs, particularly based on E-field induced band gap changes, are also known; see, e.g., U.S. application Ser. No. 09/844,862, filed Apr. 27, 2001.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 2, the switch 10 may be replicated in a two-dimensional array to form a plurality or array 24 of switches 10 to form a crossbar switch. FIG. 2 depicts a 6\u00d76 array 24. However, it is to be understood that the embodiments herein are not to be limited to the particular number of elements, or switches 10, in the array 24. Access to a single point, e.g., 2b, is done by impressing voltage on wires 2 and b to cause a change in the state of the molecular species 18 at the junction thereof, as described above. Thus, access to each junction is readily available for configuring those that are pre-selected. Details of the operation of the crossbar switch array 24 are further discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,128,214, entitled \u201cMolecular Wire Crossbar Memory\u201d, issued on Oct. 3, 2000, to Philip J. Kuekes et al., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",

An aqueous environment contains a molecule 18 with a molecular switching moiety (MD) 26 having a first connecting group (CG1) 30 attached to one end of the moiety 26, and a second connecting group (CG2) 28 attached to an opposed end of the moiety 26.",
        "In an embodiment, the molecule 18 is an organic molecule, and the molecular switching moiety 26 is at least one of an optically switchable molecular functional unit or an electrically switchable molecular functional unit. It is to be understood that the switching moiety 26 may be any suitable moiety, however, in an embodiment, the moiety 26 includes at least one of saturated hydrocarbons, unsaturated hydrocarbons, substituted hydrocarbons, heterocyclic systems, organometallic complex systems, or mixtures thereof.",
        "In an embodiment, the switching moiety 26 is a moiety that, in the presence of an electric field, undergoes oxidation or reduction, and/or experiences a band gap change. In one embodiment, the switching moiety 26 undergoes oxidation or reduction and is at least one of rotaxanes, pseudo-rotaxanes, catenanes, or mixtures thereof. An example of a switching moiety 26 that undergoes a band gap change in the presence of an external electrical field is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,674,932 granted to Zhang et al. on Jan. 6, 2004, the specification of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
        "It is to be understood that one of the first and second connecting groups (CG1, CG2) 30, 28 may be adapted to be a substantially non-protectable group while the other of the second and first connecting groups (CG2, CG1) 28, 30 may be adapted to be a substantially protectable group. In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 3A, the first connecting group (CG1) 30 is a protectable group and the second connecting group (CG2) 28 is a substantially non-protectable group.",

It is to be understood that this group may advantageously orient the molecule 18 during LB film preparation processing (discussed hereinbelow). Further, the substantially non-protectable group may advantageously remain stable during subsequent thin film preparation processes, and it may advantageously remain resistant to attack during subsequent protection and de-protection processes (discussed hereinbelow).",

        "Referring now to FIG. 3B, as the pH of the aqueous environment is adjusted, a hydrophilic temporary protecting group (TPWG) 32 may be removably attached (e.g. via chemical bonding) to the first connecting group (CG1) 30, wherein the temporary protecting group (TPWG) 32 is more hydrophilic than the first connecting group (CG1) 30 and the second connecting group (CG2) 28. Examples of hydrophilic temporary protecting groups (TPWG) 32 include, but are not limited to photo-labile acids, thermal-labile acids, chemical labile acids, derivatives thereof, and mixtures thereof.",
        "Specific non-limitative examples of photo- and thermo-labile acids include acid substituted benzyloxycarbonyl (BOC) derivatives, acid substituted 3,5-[(dimethoxybenzoinyl)oxy]carbonyl (DMO)-carbamate derivatives, acid substituted 2-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl (N-BOC) derivatives, acid substituted N-nitroveratryloxycarbonyl (NCOC) derivatives, acid substituted 4-(4\u2032,8\u2032-dimethoxylnaphthylmethyl)benzenesulfonamide derivatives, acid substituted 3,4-dimethoxy-6-nitrobenzyl carbamate derivatives, substituted 3,4-dimethoxy-6-nitrobenzyl carbamate derivatives, etc. Specific non-limitative examples of chemical labile acids include \u2014CO2\u2212, \u2014SO3\u2212, \u2014NH3+, \u2014NHR2+, \u2014NH2R+, -PyH+, carboxylic acids, carboxylic esters, amides, ketones, nitriles, \u2014OH, \u2014CH\u2550NOH, and mixtures thereof.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 3C, a Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film of the molecule 18 is formed on an interface 34 between an organic solvent(s)/air and water, the film being depicted by the plurality of molecules 18 shown. The organic solvent(s) is above the water, and in some instances may volatilize quickly; as such what was an interface 34 between water and organic solvent(s) may become an interface 34 between water and air. Thus, it is to be understood that interface 34 as defined herein may be a water/solvent interface 34 and/or a water/air interface 34. Without being bound to any theory, it is believed that the difference in hydrophilicity between the hydrophilic temporary protecting group (TPWG) 32 and the second connecting group (CG2) 28 causes formation of a substantially well-oriented, uniform LB film at the interface 34 of the organic solvent(s)/air and the water. This may be due in part to the hydrophilic temporary protecting group (TPWG) 32 remaining at the interface 34 and the second connecting group (CG2) 28 remaining in the air during LB film processing.",
        "The hydrophilic temporary protecting group (TPWG) 32 may then be removed from the first connecting group (CG1) 30. Removal of the hydrophilic temporary protecting group (TPWG) 32 may be accomplished by a thermal, chemical, photochemical process, or a combination thereof. For example, if the hydrophilic temporary protecting group (TPWG) 32 is a photo-labile group, it may be exposed to a certain wavelength of UV light for removal; if it 32 is a chemical-labile group, it may be treated with a certain chemical(s) (e.g. acid or base) for removal; or if it 32 is a thermal-labile group, it may be exposed to suitable heat for removal. After hydrophilic temporary protecting group 32 is removed, the un-capped LB film remains, thus having a reactive first connecting group (CG1) 30 and a substantially intact second connecting group (CG2) 28. It is to be understood that by-product(s) of the removal process may be at least one of water-soluble or substantially easily separable from the LB film.",
        "If the hydrophilic temporary protecting group 32 is a photo-labile group, the specific wavelength to which it is exposed for removal typically depends on the photo-labile group 32, but is that wavelength sufficient to cleave the group 32 from the first connecting group 30. The removed photo-labile group 32 dissolves in the aqueous environment.",
        "The substrate is then passed through the Langmuir-Blodgett film to form the molecular layer chemically bonded on the substrate (not shown in FIGS. 3A-3D).",

The other of the second connecting group (CG2) 28 or the first connecting group (CG1) 30 is a connecting unit between the organic molecule 18 and an other substrate (38, 40 as shown in FIGS. 4(VII) and 4(IX\u2032)). It is to be understood that the substrate 38 and the other substrate 40 is a solid substrate, and may be either an electrode or a non-electrode, depending on the application. It is to be further understood that the substrate 38 and the other substrate 40 may each be hydrophilic, hydrophobic, or one may be hydrophilic and the other may be hydrophobic. As such, first connecting group 30 or second connecting group 28 will be more attracted to the substrate 38 or the other substrate 40, depending upon the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the substrate 38 or other substrate 40 and of the connecting group 30, 28. The substrates will be discussed in further detail below in relation to FIGS. 4 through 6.",
        "Referring now to the flow diagram of FIG. 4, either one (CG1, CG2) 30, 28 or both of the first and second connecting groups (CG1, CG2) 30, 28 of the molecule 18 may be adapted to be protectable groups. The first and second connecting groups (CG1, CG2) 30, 28 may be the same, similar or different protectable groups. In this embodiment, the protectable groups include, but are not limited to at least one of multivalent hetero atoms selected from the group consisting of C, N, O, S, and P; functional groups containing the hetero atoms and selected from the group consisting of SH, OH, NH2, NH-alkyl, NH-aryl, NH-acyl, PH2, PH-alkyl, PH-aryl, PH-acyl; saturated hydrocarbons; unsaturated hydrocarbons; substituted hydrocarbons; heterocyclic compounds; carboxylic acids; carboxylic esters; amides; nitrites; and mixtures thereof.",

A first embodiment, direct linking to an electrode substrate 38, may be desirable if the first connecting group (CG1) 30 is reactive enough to form a chemical bond quickly with the bottom substrate or electrode 38 (it is to be understood that an annealing at a mild elevated temperature (one non-limitative example of a suitable annealing temperature ranges between about 50\u00b0 C. and about 250\u00b0 C.) under an inert environment (non-limitative examples of suitable inert environments include N2 or Argon atmospheres) may be advantageous in order to facilitate the solid-solid interaction).",

It is to be understood that by-product(s) of this process may be volatile under a vacuum condition and thus may be substantially easily removed from the LB film. In an embodiment, the removal is accomplished with hydrofluoric acid (HF), followed by vacuum evaporation of volatile by-products to render a complete non-protected semi-device (FIG. 4(VI)). A chemically bonded top metal substrate or electrode 40 may then be formed by any suitable process, for example, a sputtering process, a thermal vapor deposition, or an evaporative metal deposition process, to yield the desired crossbar device 10 (FIG. 4(VII)).",
