        "This application is a continuation of co-pending International Application No. PCT/DE2004/001318 filed Jun. 18, 2004, which designated the United States and was not published in English, and which is based on German Application No. 103 28 811.2 filed Jun. 20, 2003, both of which applications are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "The invention relates to semiconductor manufacturing and more particularly to organic field effect transistors (OFET) and semiconductor components having organic compounds, organic monolayers, and organic layer structures.",
        "Field effect transistors based on organic semiconductors (OFET) are of interest for a large number of electronic applications. In particular, low manufacturing costs, flexible or unbreakable substrates or the production of transistors and integrated circuits over large active areas are possible therewith. For example, organic field effect transistors are suitable as pixel control elements in active matrix screens or for the production of extremely economical integrated circuits, as used, for example, for the active marking and identification of products and goods.",
        "Since complex circuits can be built up using organic field effect transistors, there are numerous potential applications. Thus, for example, the introduction of RF-ID (RF-ID: radio frequency identification) systems based on this technology is considered a potential replacement for the bar code, which is susceptible to faults and can be used only in direct optical contact with the scanner. Passive RF-ID systems obtain their energy from the incident alternating field. The possible distance between reader and transponder depends on the radiant power and the energy requirement of the transponder. Silicon-based transponders therefore operate at supply voltages of about 3 V. Products which contain a silicon-based chip are too expensive for many applications. For example, a silicon-based identification tag is not suitable for the marking of foods (price, expiry date, etc.).",
        "Organic field effect transistors usually consist of at least four different layers applied one on top of the other: a gate electrode, a dielectric, a source-drain contact layer and an organic semiconductor. The sequence of the layers may vary. To ensure the functionality, the individual layers must be structured, which is relatively complicated.",
        "Polymers or organic semiconductors offer the potential of being able to use cheap printing techniques for their structuring and application. The gate potential for controlling the organic field effect transistors can be chosen to be all the lower but thinner in the form in which the gate dielectric (i.e. a dielectric layer) can be produced.",
        "In polymer electronics, the thickness of the gate dielectric is generally optimized so that the solution of a polymer is spun out or printed on increasingly thinly (top-down). However, this procedure encounters its limits when it is intended to achieve layer thicknesses of less than 50 nm.",
        "It is known that layers for organic field effect transistors can be built up by means of self-assembled layers comprising molecular monolayers (SEM: self-assembled monolayers).",

Vuillaume; \u201cLow-voltage, 30 nm channel length, organic transistors with a self-assembled monolayer as gate insulating films\u201d, Applied Physics Letters 76 (2000) 1941, which describes such layers.",
        "These layers are also discussed in the articles by Pradyt Ghosh, Richard M. Crooks; \u201cCovalent Grafting of a Pattered\u201d, Hyperbranched Polymer onto Plastic Substrate Using Microcontact Printing\u201d, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121 (1999) 8395-8306, and William M.

        "The articles by Collet et al. describe materials that make it possible to use transistors having SAM layers. Vinyl-terminated silanes have anchor groups on hydroxyl-containing substrate surfaces to form an SAM. This is subsequently chemically aftertreated in order to bind further molecules chemically to the SAM (cf. article by Sagiv et al.), or surfaces which permit further processing are produced (cf. article by Collet, Tharaud et al.).",
        "It is disadvantageous that these layers do not form a dense dielectric layer without aftertreatment. The chemical aftertreatments used converts only 70 to 90% of the terminal groups in a reaction time of 48 to 120 hours. This chemical aftertreatment takes too long for the production of large quantities.",
        "In principle, it is also possible to bind polymers via a plurality of coordination sites to a surface (Self-Assembled Polymers). This is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,431, U.S. Pat. No. 5,783,648 (1998) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,686,549.",

Arranged at one end is an anchor group 1 which in this case is in the form of trichlorosilane. This anchor group 1 permits binding to a substrate 10, which is not shown here (cf. FIG. 2). Arranged above the anchor group 1 is a dielectric group 2, which is in the form of n-alkyl. The chain length is n=2 to 20. A head group 3 having an aromatic system is arranged at that end of the compound 5, which is opposite the anchor group 1. This head group 3 permits a \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with other compounds of the same type and/or compounds of another type for stabilizing the monolayer (11).",

        "Chains having in each case different aromatic ring systems in the chain are also possible. The properties can be readily established via the length of the condensed chains. Smaller aromatics, which are generally not highly condensed and do not adversely affect the substantial monocrystalline or epitactic two-dimensional structure of the monolayer 11 are particularly suitable.",
        "By means of these interactions, it is possible to form layers, which are suitable for dielectrics in organic field effect transistors. In direct comparison (cf. FIG. 5 to 9), it was possible to show that SAMs without this head group 3 have a very small process window or the material compatibility with subsequent layers is not guaranteed. Below, SAMs having head groups capable of \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions are also referred to as T-SAMs.",
        "The \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction occurs spontaneously in the case of the monolayers 11 and need not be initiated. In principle, it is possible to introduce such groups for forming a \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction even within the SAM, which groups, however, can then no longer be referred to as head groups.",
        "The leakage currents of such T-SAMs are so low that they can be used as dielectrics for organic field effect transistors. Owing to their thickness of only about 3 nm, the supply voltage required for the operation of these transistors decreases to 1-2 V. If aromatic nature of the head groups is also responsible for the chemical inertness of the monolayers 11.",
        "The advantages of these monolayers 11 (T-SAM) are explained in more detail below.",
        "Chemical stability: The T-SAM is inert to all reagents, which do not destroy the bond to the substrate surface. The T-SAMs are resistant to aggressive reagents for a certain time since the reagents first have to diffuse through the monolayer 11 or have to attack it from the side. This robustness has not been observed to date in any other SAM class.",
        "Process stability: The T-SAMs tolerate lithographic steps, such as the application of photoresist, photostructuring, wet development and the stripping of photoresist. It is thus possible to build up further layers for forming an organic field effect transistor, for example on dielectric layers.",
        "Stability as a function of time and storage stability: There may be several weeks between the deposition and further processing without degradation of the T-SAM; the monolayers 11 are stable.",
        "Metal deposition: Metals can be deposited electrochemically or via the gas phase onto the T-SAMs extensively in virtually 100% yield. This high dielectric \u201cquality\u201d was not observed to date in any other SAM class. Thus, when deposited on a SAM, no metals can be deposited by vapor deposition by octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) without short-circuit, while \u03c9-phenoxyoctadecyltrichlorosilane forms such thick T-SAM layers that metal can be deposited by vapor deposition and structured over large areas at room temperature.",
        "Thermal stability: T-SAMs are stable to temperatures above 200\u00b0 C.",
        "Homogeneity of layer thickness: The layer thickness obtained is an intrinsic function of the molecular geometry and of the anchoring on the substrate. There are virtually no variations in layer thickness.",
        "Supply voltage of the transistors: A dielectric thickness of about 3 nm reduces the supply voltage required for operation to 1-2 V. A direct comparison between the 170 nm ITRS node of silicon technology and polymer electronics with the same dielectric thickness is summarized in table 1. The technology data are sufficient for a circuit design.",
        "Flexibility in the choice of substrate: The compounds 5 are particularly suitable for deposition on surfaces containing hydroxyl groups, as naturally formed, for example, by silicon or aluminum in air. However, plastic surfaces, which are activated, for example, by plasma steps or etching methods, are also suitable. Silanes form Si\u2014O bonds to the surfaces of the substrate 10. Particularly suitable silanes are tri-, di- or monochlorosilanes and tri-, di- or monoalkoxysilanes.",
        "Particularly preferred as compounds in addition to \u03c9-phenoxyoctadecyltrichlorosilane are \u03c9-biphenyloxyoctadecyltrichlorosilane and thienyloctadecyltrichlorosilane.",
        "In general, compounds capable of forming T-SAMs can also be bound to gold or copper by means of the SH coupling, to palladium by means of NC coupling or to hydrogen-terminated silicon by means of an aldehyde group. Before discussing embodiments of the layer structures according to the invention comprising monolayers 11, it is intended to explain the structure of an organic field effect transistor with reference to FIG. 4.",
        "Organic field effect transistors are electronic components, which consist of a plurality of layers, all of which are structured, in order to generate integrated circuits by connections of individual layers. FIG. 5 shows the fundamental structure of such transistors in the bottom contact architecture.",
        "Arranged on a base substrate 20 is a gate electrode 21, which is covered by a gate dielectric layer 22. Such a gate dielectric layer 22 may consist, for example, of a monolayer 11 described above. Such dielectrics have a layer thickness of less than 5 nm (bottom up).",
        "Arranged on the gate dielectric layer 22 are a source layer 23a and a drain layer 20b, both of which are connected to an active semiconducting layer 24 on top. A passivation layer 25 is arranged above the active layer 24.",
        "Examples which describe the function of embodiments of the invention are described below.",
        "For this purpose, organic field effect transistors in the so-called top contact (FIGS. 5A and 5B) or bottom contact architecture (FIG. 5c) were produced for evaluating the monolayers 11 according to the invention (T-SAMs).",
        "In the case of the top contact architecture, the source and drain electrodes (23a, 23b) are present above the organic semiconductor 25 and in the case of the bottom contact architecture said electrodes are present in the same plane as the organic semiconductor 25.",
        "For this purpose, known monolayers (SAM) and monolayers according to the invention (T-SAM) were deposited on a gate electrode material 21 as a substrate.",
        "These experimental variants are shown schematically in FIG. 5a to 5c. For the sake of simplicity, the drain contact is omitted in FIG. 5a to 5c.",
        "FIG. 5a shows a known monolayer (SAM) comprising dielectric material 22, which is used in a top contact architecture. The monolayer (SAM), the semiconducting layer 24 and the source contact 23a were applied by thermal vapor deposition.",
        "FIG. 5b shows the same structure as FIG. 5a, except that here an embodiment of the layer structure according to the invention comprising a monolayer 11 is arranged on the gate electrode material 21.",
        "FIG. 5c shows an embodiment in which an embodiment of the layer structure according to the invention comprising a monolayer 11 is used. Here, however, the source contact 23a is formed in a bottom contact architecture.",
        "The results of measurements will be discussed below, the numerical values of the experiments being summarized in FIG. 12.",
        "An SAM comprising octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) was deposited from the gas phase onto a highly doped wafer as gate electrode material 21. Thereafter, in each case 30 nm organic semiconductor layers 24 comprising",

        "Result:",
        "a. In the case of pentacene, no organic field effect transistors were obtained (FIG. 2, experiment UZ-36).",
        "b. In the case of \u03b1,\u03c9-bisdecylsexithienyl (FIG. 2, experiment ZU-35), it was possible to obtain field effect transistors. This is due to the special alkyl-alkyl interaction of the sexithiophene and the SAM. The characteristics obtained are shown in FIG. 6a to 6c.",

        "In the case of the SAM, the presence of field effect transistor behavior evidently depends on the organic semiconductor material chosen.",
        "Control experiments show that the transistor functionality is obtained only in the case of a deposited SAM. A natural oxide layer on silicon is not sufficient in this case (FIG. 2, experiment UZ-37). As an alternative to silicon as substrate 11, the OTS SAM also forms on aluminum. The characteristics are shown in FIGS. 7a and 7b (FIG. 2, experiment ZU-43). The layer thickness of the OTS SAM is 2.5 nm. The other parameters are:\n\nL=130 \u03bcm\n\nW=170 \u03bcm\n\n\u03bc=0.03 cm2/Vs (carrier mobility)\n\nThreshold voltage=\u22120.9 V\n\nSubthreshold slope=360 mV/decade\n\non/off current ratio=103",
        "For complete integration, the electrodes cannot be defined by shadow masks, owing to the limitation of the resolution. The bottom contact transistor architecture is suitable for fine structuring. However, bottom contact transistors having an OTS SAM as gate dielectric showed only short-circuits between source/gate and drain/gate.",
        "In example 2, the behavior or an embodiment of the layer structure according to the invention is investigated.",
        "In contrast to example 1, here \u03c9-phenoxyoctadecyltrichlorosilane permits the production of organic field effect transistors in top and bottom contact architecture, independently of the organic semiconductor. This behavior demonstrates the extreme stability and quality of the T-SAMs.",
        "For the preparation of the top contact architecture (cf. FIG. 5b), a T-SAM was applied from liquid phase to a highly doped silicon substrate 21. Alternatively, application from the gas phase analogous to example 1 is also possible. The top contact transistor were then produced in the same manner as described in example 1:",
        "Vapor deposition of the organic semiconductor pentacene; definition of the metal contacts comprising gold\u2014by shadow mask/vaporization.",
        "The characteristics of an organic field effect transistor produced in this manner are shown in FIG. 8a to 8c (FIG. 2, experiment UZ-31).

        "The high quality of the T-SAM layer of the layer structure according to the invention compared with the OTS SAM is evident here since, in the case of a top contact structure with OTS SAM and pentacene as semiconductor, no field effect could be observed (cf. example 1 point a).",

Channel length and width can be adapted to the respective requirements.",
        "For this purpose, a T-SAM is applied from the liquid phase to a highly doped silicon substrate 21 (alternatively, application from the gas phase analogously to example 1 is also possible). A 30 nm thick gold layer is subsequently deposited thereon by vapor deposition. The source and drain contacts 23a, 23b are defined on said gold layer photolithographically and etched by a wet chemical method (I2/KI solution). The contacts are cleaned by means of acetone in order to remove the photoresist etch mask. The organic semiconductor (pentacene) is then deposited.",

        "For this purpose, the procedure in UZ-33 (example 2, bottom contact) is adopted. Instead of pentacene, a 1% solution of poly-3-hexylthiophene in chloroform is applied by spin coating for 10 seconds at 2000 revolutions and dried at 60\u00b0 C. for 10 min on a hotplate.",
        "If, instead of the \u03c9-substituted alkyltrichlorosilanes, other suitable compounds, in particular \u03c9-substituted alkanethiols and alkaneselenols, such as 18-phenoxyoctadecanethiol, and the analogous disulfides and diselenides are used, insulating SAMs can be produced on metals. Platinum, palladium, copper, silver, gold and mercury are suitable for this purpose.",

The layers thus obtained can be contacted by vapor deposition of metals or by electrolyte and exhibit good insulation properties. The current density measured at 1.5 V (gold, 18-phenoxyoctadecanethiol) was 7.4 A/m2.",
        "Further experiments showed that the deposition from the gas phase (reduced pressure, elevated temperature) gives better layers than deposition from solution. In FIG. 12, this is evident from the values for ID/IG and IG of the experiments MH-357, MH 362 (gas phase) in comparison with UZ-31, UZ-33 (liquid phase).",
