        "This application is a division of application Ser. No. 09/613,331 filed on Jul. 7, 2000 U.S. Pat. No. 7,098,538, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "This invention relates to a system semiconductor device and a method of manufacturing the same, and in particular, to a system semiconductor device having a plurality of functional blocks.",
        "The conventional system LSI (Large-Scale-Integrated circuit) generally includes a plurality of functional blocks. Herein, it is to be noted that the functional block serves as a circuit unit for realizing a specific function. In such a system LSI, complex functions are integrated on one chip.",
        "The conventional method of manufacturing the system LSI has been carried out as follows.",
        "A plurality of functional blocks are first fabricated on a silicon chip. Thereafter, a circuit wiring layer which electrically connects the functional blocks to each other is formed on the silicon chip by the use of a metal vaporizing method or a metal plating method.",
        "Subsequently, an insulating film is formed thereon and the circuit wiring layer and the insulating layer are sequentially laminated. Thereby, a global wiring layer serving as a multi-wiring layer is formed on the silicon chip.",
        "Thus, a plurality of circuit wiring layers and insulating layers conventionally has been laminated for many times to manufacture the system LSI.",
        "However, the conventional system LSI has the following problems.",
        "First, manufacturing yield is degraded. This reason will be explained below. Namely, an external stress is applied or stress-migration occurs because a plurality of circuit wiring layers and insulating layers are laminated.",
        "Under this circumstance, the circuit wiring layer is peeled from the insulating layer. Consequently, a physical strength is inevitably lowered.",
        "Further, an electrical connection between layers is damaged. In consequence, electrical connection reliability is readily degraded.",
        "Second, a manufacturing duration becomes long. This reason will be explained as follows.",
        "Namely, after the system LSI is fabricated, a plurality circuit wiring layers and insulating layers are alternately laminated on a system LSI cell. To this end, complex and many steps are inevitably required.",
        "Third, selection degree of freedom concerning materials of the global wiring layer and manufacturing processes is lowered. This reason will be described below.",
        "That is, the manufacturing process of the global wiring layer or the materials of the circuit wiring layers and the insulating layers are restricted in dependency upon a laminating process. Consequently, the manufacturing process and the material can not freely or suitably selected.",
        "Fourth, physical characteristics and electrical characteristics are degraded, and the manufacturing cost becomes high. This reason will be explained as follows.",
        "The manufacturing process of the global wiring line layer or the materials of the circuit wiring layers and the insulating layers are restricted in accordance with the laminating process. Consequently, the manufacturing process and the material can not freely or suitably selected.",
        "Fifth, the electrical characteristic for a high-frequency signal is degraded. This reason will be explained below.",
        "That is, a system LSI cell portion and the global wiring line layer are adjacently arranged to each other. In consequence, dielectric constants are enhanced to each other, and impedance of the circuit is also increased.",
        "It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a system semiconductor device which has a simple manufacturing step and a cheap manufacturing cost.",

        "Instead, the global wiring layer may have a first wiring layer formed on the semiconductor substrate, an insulating layer formed on the first wiring layer, a second wiring layer formed on the insulating layer, and inner bumps formed on the second wiring layer.",

        "Similarly, although the insulating layer 14 is formed by a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, and polyimide, optional material may be used other than them.",
        "Likely, the buried via 12 and the via 14a are formed by burying the conductive metal for internal surface of the buried via 12 and the via 14a by the use of the selective CVD method or by plating the conductive metal, such as, Cu.",
        "Alternatively, the buried via 12 and the via 14a may be formed by filling and hardening the conductive paste mixed with metal powder inside the buried via 12 and the via 14a. Instead, they may be formed by using an arbitrary method by the use of an optional conductive material.",
        "Subsequently, description will be made about a method of manufacturing the system LSI according to the first embodiment.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 4A through 4C, description will be made about a method of manufacturing the system LSI cell portion 7 of the system LSI 10.",
        "First, the silicon chip 1 is prepared by dicing and separating a silicon wafer, as illustrated in FIG. 4A.",
        "Next, the pattern forming process, the ion injection process and the stepper process are carried out for the silicon chip 1 to form the functional blocks 2 to 6 on the silicon chip 1, as illustrated in FIG. 4B.",
        "Herein, the respective gates in the functional blocks 2 to 6 are connected to each other by the use of polysilicon or a aluminum wiring pattern which is used in the general structure of the LSI wiring layer.",
        "Subsequently, external terminals are formed to connect between the respective functional blocks 2 to 6. To this end, pads 2a to 6a are formed at specific portions on the surface of the functional blocks 2 to 6, as illustrated in FIG. 4C.",
        "In this event, the connection net number between the functional blocks 2 to 6 of the pads 2a to 6a is largely low in comparison with the connection net number in the functional blocks 2 to 6. Consequently, the number of the pads 2a to 6a may be not much high.",
        "Therefore, if each of the pads 2a to 6a has a size of 10 \u03bcm and a space (pitch) of 12 \u03bcm between the pads 2a to 6a, the pads 2a to 6a can be formed with such number that enough connection is possible.",
        "Meanwhile, it is to be noted that each of the pads 2a to 6a may be formed by the use of metal film, such as, copper, gold, gold tin solder, tin lead solder. Thus, the system LSI cell portion 7 is completed.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 5A through 5F, description will be made about the global wiring layer 8 of the system LSI 10.",
        "First, the silicon substrate 11 is prepared, as illustrated in FIG. 5A.",
        "Next, the buried vias 12 are formed inside the silicon substrate 11 by the use of the selective CVD method or the metal plating method, as illustrated in FIG. 5B.",
        "Successively, the conductive material, such as, Cu is deposited on the surface of the silicon substrate 11, and the first wiring layer 13 is formed by a patterning process after an exposing and developing process, as shown in FIG. 5C.",
        "Subsequently, the insulating film 14 is deposited on the surface of the first wiring layer 13. Thereafter, the vias 14 are formed at specific portions in the insulating layer 14 so as to penetrate the insulating layer 14, as shown in FIG. 5D. Thereby, the via 14a electrically mutually connects the first wiring layer 13 with the second wiring layer 15.",
        "Next, the conductive material, such as, Cu and Au is deposited on the surface of the insulating layer 14 and the vias 14a by the sputtering method or the plating method, and the second wiring layer 15 is formed by the patterning process after the exposing and developing process, as illustrated in FIG. 5E.",
        "Finally, heat-hardening adhesives are supplied to a region except for a region where the second wiring layer 15 is formed on the surface of the global wiring layer 8 to form the adhesive layer 16, as illustrated in FIG. 5F. Thus, the global wiring layer 8 is completed.",
        "In the first embodiment, the following process rule may be, for example, adopted.",
        "Namely, a line width is equal 10 \u03bcm, and a wiring space is equal to 10 \u03bcm. Further, a conductor thickness of the first and second wiring layer 13 and 15 is equal to 10 \u03bcm while an insulating thickness of the insulating layer 14 is equal to 10 \u03bcm.",
        "Thus, the global wiring layer 8 can be formed by the use of a relatively rough process rule in the first embodiment. Consequently, only the global wiring layer 8 can be independently manufactured by using cheaper equipment than a mounting equipment for forming the system LSI cell portion 7.",
        "Although the first and second wiring layers 13 and 15 and the insulating layer 14 are used as the global wiring layer, the layer number of these wiring layers and the insulating layer is not restricted, and a single layer or a multiple layer may be used.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 6A through 6C, description will be made about a method of manufacturing the system LSI 10.",
        "The global wiring layer 8 is transferred onto the system LSI cell portion 7, as illustrated in FIG. 6A. In this event, the system LSI cell portion 7 is mounted on a stage (not shown) while the global wiring layer 8 is transferred on the condition that the global wiring layer 8 is turned over.",
        "Under this circumstance, the pads 2a to 6a of the system LSI cell portion 7 are positioned in opposition to the second wiring layer 15 of the global wiring layer 8 by using a position detecting device, such as, an image camera.",
        "Next, the LSI cell portion 7 and the global wiring layer are overlapped to each other. In the condition, a pressure is applied upwards and downward, and a heating process is carried out.",
        "Thereby, the adhesive layer 16 is heat-hardened, and the system LSI cell portion 7 and the global wiring layer 8 are bonded and hardened. Consequently, the pads 2a to 6a of the system LSI cell portion 7 are coupled with the second wiring layer 15 of the global wiring layer 8, and are mutually and electrically connected, as illustrated in FIG. 6B.",
        "Finally, the silicon substrate 11 is polished from an upper side of the global wiring layer 8, as illustrated in FIG. 6C. Thereby, the buried vias 12 are exposed on the surface, and serves as the electrodes for the external circuit. Thus, the system LSI 10 is completed.",
        "Thus, after the system LSI cell portion 7 and the global wiring layer 8 are independently manufactured, and they are laminated or combined to form the system LSI 10, in the first embodiment.",
        "After the system LSI cell portion 7 and the global wiring layer 8 are laminated or combined to each other, the buried vias 12 are exposed to the surface in the first embodiment.",
        "Alternatively, after the buried vias 12 are exposed to the surface before the laminating or combining step, the system LSI may be manufactured by laminating or combining them.",
        "Referring to FIG. 7, description will be made about a system LSI according to a second embodiment of this invention.",
        "The system LSI 10 according to the second embodiment has a substantially similar structure with the system LSI according to the first embodiment.",
        "However, the second embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that an organic substrate is used instead of the silicon substrate 11.",
        "Herein, it is to be noted that organic material, such as, epoxy resin and polyimide, is used as a base member. As the organic substrate, a flexible substrate having a relatively thin thickness and flexibility is suitable.",
        "Subsequently, description will be made about a method of manufacturing the system LSI 10 according to the second embodiment.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 8A through 8E, description will be made about a method of manufacturing a global wiring layer 8 of the system LSI 10.",
        "A plurality of second wiring layers 20a are laminated by the use of the known forming method of the multiple wiring pattern to form the second wiring layer 20, as shown in FIG. 8A.",
        "Successively, the global wiring layer 8 is manufactured in the same manner as the steps illustrated in FIGS. 5A through 5E, as shown in FIGS. 8B through 8E.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 9A through 9C, description will be made about a method of manufacturing the system LSI 10 according to the second embodiment.",
        "In the system LSI cell portion 7, the functional blocks 2 to 6 are formed on the surface of the silicon chip 1 in the same steps illustrated in FIG. 4A through FIG. 4C.",
        "The global wiring layer 8 is transferred onto the system LSI cell portion 7 illustrated in FIG. 4C, as illustrated in FIG. 9A. In this event, the system LSI cell portion 7 is mounted on a stage (not shown) while the global wiring layer 8 is transferred on the condition that the global wiring layer 8 is turned over.",
        "Under this circumstance, the pads 2a to 6a of the system LSI cell portion 7 are positioned in opposition to the wiring layer 15 of the global wiring layer 8 by using a position detecting device, such as, an image camera.",
        "Next, the system LSI cell portion 7 and the global wiring layer are overlapped to each other. In the condition, a pressure is applied upwards and downward, and a heating process is carried out, as illustrated in FIG. 9B.",
        "Thereby, the adhesive layer 16 is heat-hardened, and the system LSI cell portion 7 and the global wiring layer 8 are bonded and hardened. Consequently, the pads 2a to 6a of the system LSI cell portion 7 are coupled with the second wiring layer 15 of the global wiring layer 8, and are mutually and electrically connected.",
        "Finally, solder balls are supplied on the surface of the second wiring layer 20a exposed at an upper side of the global wiring layer 8, and are welded to for bumps 26. Thereby, the system LSI 10 is completed.",
        "Thus, as the material of the global wiring layer 8, the organic substrate formed by the organic material is used instead of the silicon substrate 11 as the semiconductor substrate 11 of the first embodiment in the second embodiment.",
        "Thereby, the second wiring layer 20, which electrically connects the functional blocks 2 to 6 with the bumps 26, is integrally formed with the global wiring layer 8.",
        "In consequence, the physical strength is enhanced, and the electrical connection reliability is also enhanced. Further, a technique, which has a low cost and is generally utilized for the organic wiring substrate, is applicable.",
        "Referring to FIG. 10, description will be made about a system LSI 10 according to a third embodiment of this invention.",
        "The system LSI 10 according to the second embodiment has a substantially similar structure with the system LSI according to the first embodiment.",
        "However, the third embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that the system LSI cell portion 7 is connected to the global wiring layer 8 with a space 31 through inner bumps 30.",
        "Subsequently, description will be made about a method of manufacturing the system LSI 10 according to the third embodiment.",

        "The global wiring layer 8 is transferred onto the system LSI cell portion 7 illustrated in FIG. 4C, as illustrated in FIG. 12A.

        "Thereby, the global wiring layer 8 serving as dielectric is not adjacently and directly arranged for the system LSI cell portion 7.",

Conversely, the pads may be formed on the global wiring layer 8 while the pads or the bumps may be formed on the system LSI cell portion 7.",
        "Although the adhesive layer 16 is supplied in the final step of the global wiring layer 8, the adhesive layer 16 may be supplied in an arbitrary step among a group of steps for laminating the system LSI cell portion 7 with the global wiring layer 8.",
