        "The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for performing electrical stimulation of the heart via an implantable system.",
        "Defibrillation/cardioversion is a technique employed to counter arrhythmic heart conditions including some tachycardias in the atria and/or ventricles. Typically, electrodes are employed to stimulate the heart with electrical impulses or shocks, of a magnitude substantially greater than pulses used in cardiac pacing.",
        "Defibrillation/cardioversion systems include body implantable electrodes and are referred to as implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (ICDs). Such electrodes can be in the form of patches applied directly to epicardial tissue, or at the distal end regions of intravascular catheters, inserted into a selected cardiac chamber. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,603,705; 4,693,253; 4,944,300; and 5,105,810, the disclosures of which are all incorporated herein by reference, disclose intravascular or transvenous electrodes, employed either alone or in combination with an epicardial patch electrode. Compliant epicardial defibrillator electrodes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,567,900 and 5,618,287, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. A sensing epicardial electrode configuration is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,476,503, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "In addition to epicardial and transvenous electrodes, subcutaneous electrode systems have also been developed. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,342,407 and 5,603,732, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference, teach the use of a pulse monitor/generator surgically implanted into the abdomen and subcutaneous electrodes implanted in the thorax. This system is far more complicated to use than current ICD systems using transvenous lead systems together with an active can electrode and therefore it has no practical use. It has in fact never been used because of the surgical difficulty of applying such a device (3 incisions), the impractical abdominal location of the generator and the electrically poor sensing and defibrillation aspects of such a system.",
        "Recent efforts to improve the efficiency of ICDs have led manufacturers to produce ICDs which are small enough to be implanted in the pectoral region. In addition, advances in circuit design have enabled the housing of the ICD to form a subcutaneous electrode. Some examples of ICDs in which the housing of the ICD serves as an optional additional electrode are described in U.S. Pat.

        "ICDs are now an established therapy for the management of life threatening cardiac rhythm disorders, primarily ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib). ICDs are very effective at treating V-Fib, but are therapies that still require significant surgery.",
        "As ICD therapy becomes more prophylactic in nature and used in progressively less ill individuals, especially children at risk of cardiac arrest, the requirement of ICD therapy to use intravenous catheters and transvenous leads is an impediment to very long term management as most individuals will begin to develop complications related to lead system malfunction sometime in the 5-10 year time frame, often earlier. In addition, chronic transvenous lead systems, their reimplantation and removals, can damage major cardiovascular venous systems and the tricuspid valve, as well as result in life threatening perforations of the great vessels and heart. Consequently, use of transvenous lead systems, despite their many advantages, are not without their chronic patient management limitations in those with life expectancies of >5 years. The problem of lead complications is even greater in children where body growth can substantially alter transvenous lead function and lead to additional cardiovascular problems and revisions. Moreover, transvenous ICD systems also increase cost and require specialized interventional rooms and equipment as well as special skill for insertion. These systems are typically implanted by cardiac electrophysiologists who have had a great deal of extra training.",
        "In addition to the background related to ICD therapy, the present invention requires a brief understanding of automatic external defibrillator (AED) therapy. AEDs employ the use of cutaneous patch electrodes to effect defibrillation under the direction of a bystander user who treats the patient suffering from V-Fib. AEDs can be as effective as an ICD if applied to the victim promptly within 2 to 3 minutes.",
        "AED therapy has great appeal as a tool for diminishing the risk of death in public venues such as in air flight. However, an AED must be used by another individual, not the person suffering from the potential fatal rhythm. It is more of a public health tool than a patient-specific tool like an ICD. Because >75% of cardiac arrests occur in the home, and over half occur in the bedroom, patients at risk of cardiac arrest are often alone or asleep and can not be helped in time with an AED. Moreover, its success depends to a reasonable degree on an acceptable level of skill and calm by the bystander user.",
        "What is needed therefore, especially for children and for prophylactic long term use, is a combination of the two forms of therapy which would provide prompt and near-certain defibrillation, like an ICD, but without the long-term adverse sequelae of a transvenous lead system while simultaneously using most of the simpler and lower cost technology of an AED. What is also needed is a cardioverter/defibrillator that is of simple design and can be comfortably implanted in a patient for many years.",
        "The present invention, in an illustrative embodiment, includes an implantable lead electrode assembly comprising an electrode, a riser coupled to the electrode, and a head coupled to the riser. The implantable lead electrode assembly may have various shape characteristics in several embodiments. For example, in one embodiment the riser is substantially planar. In another embodiment, the head is substantially planar.",
        "In a further embodiment, the riser comprises a proximal end, a distal end, a top, and a bottom, where the proximal end is closer to the distal end at the top of the riser than at the bottom of the riser. The invention may further include a lead coupled to the electrode. In some embodiments, the lead may be coupled to the electrode without coupling through the riser or head, and/or the lead may be coupled to the electrode closer to the distal end of the electrode than the proximal end of the electrode.",
        "In yet another embodiment, the lead assembly may further include a backing layer and a foundation having a front side and a back side. The backing layer can be disposed between the front side of the foundation and the electrode, and the riser may then be secured to the back side of the foundation. In such an embodiment, the backing layer and/or foundation may electrically insulate a side of the electrode.",
        "The invention may also include, in an illustrative embodiment, a cover assembly including a skirt partially covering a front side of the electrode, and a back portion, wherein the back portion and the riser generally electrically isolate a back side of the electrode. In additional embodiments, an implantable housing containing electrical circuitry for providing electrical therapy to a patient's heart may be provided along with these various illustrative lead assembly embodiments.",

        "For the purposes of the following description, the terms \u201cproximal\u201d and \u201cdistal\u201d take the following meanings. For a device temporarily inserted and manipulated by a physician, the proximal end of the device is the device that the physician grasps, or is the end of the device which extends out of the patient. For permanently implanted devices such as the ICD devices discussed herein, the proximal end of a lead assembly refers to the end of the lead assembly which connects to a canister containing the operational circuitry of the ICD. The distal end, in each case, refers to the end of an elongate medical device opposite the proximal end.",
        "Turning now to FIG. 1, the S-ICD of the present invention is illustrated. The S-ICD includes an electrically active canister 11 and a subcutaneous electrode lead assembly 13 attached to the canister. The canister 11 has an electrically active surface 15 that is electrically insulated from an electrode connector block 17 and a canister housing 16 via insulating area 14. The canister 11 can be similar to numerous electrically active canisters 11 commercially available in that the canister 11 will contain a power supply and operational circuitry. Alternatively, the canister 11 can be thin and elongated to conform to the intercostal space. The circuitry will be able to monitor cardiac rhythms for irregularities (such as fibrillation or tachycardia), and if detected, will initiate a process for delivering cardioversion/defibrillation energy through the active surface 15 of the housing and to the subcutaneous electrode lead assembly 13. Examples of such circuitry are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,693,253 and 5,105,810, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. The canister circuitry can provide cardioversion/defibrillation energy in different types of waveforms. In the preferred embodiment, a biphasic waveform is used of approximately 10-20 ms total duration and with the initial phase containing approximately \u2154 of the energy, however, any suitable waveform can be utilized (e.g., monophasic, biphasic, and/or multiphasic).",
        "In addition to providing cardioversion/defibrillation energy, the circuitry can also provide transthoracic cardiac pacing energy. The operational circuitry would then be able to monitor the heart for bradycardia and/or tachycardia rhythms. Once a bradycardia or tachycardia rhythm is detected, the circuitry can then deliver appropriate pacing energy at appropriate intervals through the active surface and the subcutaneous electrode. Pacing stimuli are preferably biphasic (though any other suitable waveform may be used as well) and similar in pulse amplitude to that used for conventional transthoracic pacing.",
        "This same circuitry can, alternatively, also be used to deliver low amplitude shocks on the T-wave for induction of ventricular fibrillation for testing S-ICD performance in treating V-Fib as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,129,392, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Also the circuitry can be provided with a mode for rapid induction of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia using rapid ventricular pacing. Another optional way for inducing ventricular fibrillation would be to provide a continuous low voltage, i.e., about three volts, across the heart during the entire cardiac cycle.",
        "Another optional aspect of the present invention is that the operational circuitry may be adapted to detect the presence of atrial fibrillation as described in Olson, W. et al. \u201cOnset And Stability For Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia Detection in an Implantable Cardioverter and Defibrillator,\u201d Computers in Cardiology (1986) pp. 167-170. Detection can be provided via R-R cycle length instability detection algorithms. Once atrial fibrillation has been detected, the operational circuitry will then provide QRS synchronized atrial defibrillation/cardioversion.",
        "The sensing circuitry utilizes the electronic signals generated from the heart and will primarily detect QRS waves. In one embodiment, the circuitry will be programmed to detect ventricular tachycardias or fibrillations. The detection circuitry will utilize, in its most direct form, a rate detection algorithm that triggers charging of a capacitor once the ventricular rate exceeds some predetermined level for a fixed period of time. One trigger could be, for example, if the ventricular rate exceeds two hundred forty bpm on average for more than four seconds. Once the capacitor is charged, a confirmatory rhythm check would ensure that the rate persists for at least another one second before discharge. Similarly, termination algorithms could be instituted that ensure that a rhythm less than two hundred forty bpm persisting for at least four seconds before the capacitor charge is drained to an internal resistor. Detection, confirmation and termination algorithms as are described above and in the art can be modulated to increase sensitivity and specificity by examining QRS beat-to-beat uniformity, QRS signal frequency content, R-R interval stability data, and signal amplitude characteristics all or part of which can be used to increase or decrease both sensitivity and specificity of S-ICD arrhythmia detection function.",
        "In addition to use of sense circuitry for detection of V-Fib or V-Tach by examining QRS waves, the sense circuitry can check for the presence or the absence of respiration. The respiration rate can be detected by monitoring the impedance across the thorax using subthreshold currents delivered across the active can and the high voltage subcutaneous lead electrode and monitoring the frequency in undulation in the waveform that results from the undulations of transthoracic impedance during the respiratory cycle. If there is no undulation, then the patent is not respiring and this lack of respiration can be used to confirm the QRS findings of cardiac arrest. The same technique can be used to provide information about the respiratory rate or estimate cardiac output as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,095,987, 5,423,326, 4,450,527, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "The canister of the present invention can be made out of titanium alloy or other presently preferred electrically active canister designs. However, it is contemplated that a malleable canister that can conform to the curvature of the patient's chest will be preferred. In this way the patient can have a comfortable canister that conforms to the shape of the patient's rib cage. Examples of conforming canisters are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 5,645,586, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Therefore, the canister can be made out of numerous materials such as medical grade plastics, metals, and alloys. In the preferred embodiment, the canister is smaller than sixty cc volume having a weight of less than one hundred gms for long-term wearability. This size may have added importance in some applications, such as implantations in children. The canister and the lead of the S-ICD can also use fractal or wrinkled surfaces to increase surface area to improve defibrillation capability. Because of the primary prevention role of the therapy and the likely need to reach energies over forty joules, a feature of one preferred embodiment is an extended, or intentionally long, capacitor charge time resulting in reduced energy loss and allowing use of smaller components. Examples of small ICD housings are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,597,956 and 5,405,363, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.",
        "Different subcutaneous electrode lead assemblies 13 of the present invention are illustrated in FIGS. 1-3. Turning to FIG. 1, the lead 21 for the subcutaneous electrode lead assembly 13 is preferably composed of silicone or polyurethane insulation. The lead 21 is connected to the canister 11 at its proximal end via a connection port 19 which is located on an electrode connector block 17 of the canister 11. The electrode connector block 17 may be electrically isolated. The electrode lead assembly 13 illustrated includes three different electrodes 23, 25, 27 secured to the lead 21. In the embodiment illustrated, an optional anchor segment 52 is attached at the most distal end of the subcutaneous electrode lead assembly 13 for anchoring to soft tissue such that the electrode lead assembly 13 does not dislodge after implantation.",
        "The most distal electrode on the subcutaneous electrode lead assembly shown in FIG. 1 is shown as a coil electrode 27, which is used for delivering the high voltage cardioversion/defibrillation energy across the heart. The coil cardioversion/defibrillation electrode is about 5-10 cm in length. Proximal to the coil electrode 27 are two sense electrodes 23, 25, with a first sense electrode 25 is located proximally of the coil electrode and a second sense electrode 23 located proximally of the first sense electrode 25. The sense electrodes 23, 25 are preferably spaced far enough apart to be able to allow good QRS detection. This spacing can range from one to ten cm with four cm being presently preferred. The electrodes 23, 25 may or may not be circumferential with the preferred embodiment. Having the sense electrodes 23, 25 non-circumferential and positioned outward, toward the skin surface, is a way to minimize muscle artifact and enhance QRS signal quality. The sensing electrodes 23, 25 are electrically isolated from the coil electrode 27 via insulating areas 29. Similar types of cardioversion/defibrillation electrodes are currently commercially available with transvenous configuration. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,534,022, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference, disclosures a composite electrode with a coil cardioversion/defibrillation electrode and sense electrodes.",
        "Modifications to this arrangement are contemplated within the scope of the invention. One such modification is illustrated in FIG. 2 where the two sensing electrodes 25 and 23 are located distally and proximally, respectively, of the coil electrode 27. This may enable greater spacing, for example, depending on the length of the coil electrode 27, the sense electrodes may be about six to twelve cm apart. Note also that the optional anchor segment 52 is omitted. Further modifications of the canister 11 are noted below.",
        "Another electrode lead assembly modification is shown in FIG. 3, where the sensing electrodes 23, 25 are shown as non-circumferential electrodes, both being located distally of the coil electrode 27. Other possible electrode configurations are contemplated within the present invention. One example would be to omit one of the \u201csensing\u201d electrodes 23 or 25, and to use the coil electrode 27 as both a sensing electrode and a cardioversion/defibrillation electrode.",
        "It is also contemplated within the scope of the invention that the sensing of QRS waves (and transthoracic impedance) can be carried out via sense electrodes on the canister housing or in combination with the cardioversion/defibrillation coil electrode and/or the subcutaneous lead sensing electrode(s). In this way, sensing could be performed via the one coil electrode located on the subcutaneous electrode lead assembly and the active surface on the canister housing. Another possibility would be to have only one sense electrode located on the subcutaneous electrode lead assembly and the sensing would be performed by that one electrode and either the coil electrode on the subcutaneous electrode lead assembly or by the active surface of the canister. The use of sensing electrodes on the canister would eliminate the need for sensing electrodes on the subcutaneous electrode. It is also contemplated that the subcutaneous electrode would be provided with at least one sense electrode, the canister with at least one sense electrode, and if multiple sense electrodes are used on either the subcutaneous electrode and/or the canister, that the best QRS wave detection combination will be identified when the S-ICD is implanted and this combination can be selected, activating the best sensing arrangement from all the existing sensing possibilities.",
        "Turning again to FIG. 2, two sensing electrodes 26 and 28 are located on the electrically active surface 15 with electrical insulator rings 30 placed between the sense electrodes 26, 28 and the active surface 15. These canister sense electrodes 26, 28 could be switched off and electrically insulated during and shortly after defibrillation/cardioversion shock delivery. The canister sense electrodes 26, 28 may also be placed on the electrically inactive surface 14 of the canister 11. In the embodiment of FIG. 2, there are actually four sensing electrodes 23, 25, 26, 28: two (23, 25) on the subcutaneous lead assembly 13 and two (26, 28) on the canister 11. In the preferred embodiment, the ability to change which electrodes are used for sensing would be a programmable feature of the S-ICD to adapt to changes in the patient physiology over time. The programming could be done via the use of physical switches on the canister 11, or as presently preferred, via the use of a programming wand or via a wireless connection to program the circuitry within the canister 11.",
        "The canister 11 could be employed as either a cathode or an anode of the S-ICD cardioversion/defibrillation system. If the canister 11 is the cathode, then the subcutaneous coil electrode 27 would be the anode. Likewise, if the canister 11 is the anode, then the subcutaneous coil electrode 27 would be the cathode.",
        "The active canister housing will provide energy and voltage intermediate to that available with ICDs and most AEDs. The typical maximum voltage necessary for ICDs using most biphasic waveforms is approximately 750 Volts with an associated maximum energy of approximately 40 Joules. The typical maximum voltage necessary for AEDs is approximately 2000-5000 Volts with an associated maximum energy of approximately 200-360 Joules depending upon the model and waveform used. The S-ICD of the present invention uses maximum voltages in the range of about 700 to about 3150 Volts and is associated with energies of about 40 to about 210 Joules. The capacitance of the S-ICD could range from about 50 to about 200 microfarads.",
        "The sense circuitry contained within the canister 11 is highly sensitive and specific for the presence or absence of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Features of the detection algorithm are programmable and the algorithm is focused on the detection of V-FIB and high rate V-TACH (>240 bpm). Although the S-ICD of the present invention may rarely be used for an actual life-threatening event, the simplicity of design and implementation allows it to be employed in large populations of patients at modest risk with modest cost by non-cardiac electrophysiologists. Consequently, the S-ICD of the present invention focuses mostly on the detection and therapy of the most malignant rhythm disorders. As part of the detection algorithm's applicability to children, the upper rate range is programmable upward for use in children, known to have rapid supraventricular tachycardias and more rapid ventricular fibrillation. Energy levels also are programmable downward in order to allow treatment of neonates and infants.",
        "Turning now to FIG. 4, the preferred subcutaneous placement of the S-ICD of the present invention is illustrated. As would be clear to a person skilled in the art, the actual location of the S-ICD is in a subcutaneous space that is developed during the implantation process. The heart is not exposed during this process and the heart is schematically illustrated in the figures only for help in understanding where the canister 11 and coil electrode 27 are located with respect to the heart. For the illustrative electrode lead assembly in FIG. 4, the sensing electrodes 23, 25 are proximal of the coil electrode 27, and two canister sensing electrodes 26, 28 are also shown. The lead 21 of the subcutaneous electrode lead assembly traverses in a subcutaneous path around the thorax terminating with the (distal) coil electrode 27 at the posterior axillary line, preferably just lateral to the left scapula. This way the canister 11 and coil electrode 27 provide a reasonably good pathway for current delivery to the majority of the ventricular myocardium.",
        "FIG. 5 illustrates a different placement of the present invention. The S-ICD canister 11 is shown located in the left posterior axillary line approximately lateral to the tip of the inferior portion of the scapula. This location is especially useful in children. The lead 21 of the subcutaneous electrode assembly traverses in a subcutaneous path around the thorax terminating with its distal sense electrode 25 at the anterior precordial region, ideally in the inframammary crease. Here, the electrode lead assembly is shown with a distal sense electrode 25, an intermediate coil electrode 27, and a proximal sense electrode 23.",
        "FIG. 6 illustrates the embodiment of FIG. 3 subcutaneously implanted in the thorax with the distally located sense electrodes 23 and 25 located at approximately the tip of the inferior portion of the scapula, with the more proximally located coil electrode 27 located at approximately the left axillary line.",
        "FIG. 7 schematically illustrates the method for implanting the S-ICD of the present invention. An incision 31 is made in the left anterior axillary line approximately at the level of the cardiac apex. This incision location is selected specifically to allow both canister location more medially in the left inframammary crease and lead positioning more posteriorly via the introducer set (described below) around to the left posterior axillary line lateral to the left scapula. The incision can be anywhere on the thorax deemed reasonable by the implanting physician, but is preferably located as illustrated. A subcutaneous pocket and pathway 33 is then created medially along the inframammary crease for the canister and posteriorly to the left posterior axillary line, then toward the left scapula for the lead.",
        "The S-ICD canister is then placed subcutaneously at the location of the incision or medial of the incision in the subcutaneous region along the left inframammary crease. The electrode lead assembly is placed subcutaneously with a specially designed curved introducer set 40, an illustrative example of which is shown in FIG. 8. The introducer set comprises a curved trocar 42 and a stiff curved peel away sheath 44. The peel away sheath 44 is curved to allow for placement around the rib cage of the patient in the subcutaneous space created by the trocar 42. The sheath 44 has to be stiff enough to allow for the placement of the electrode lead assembly without the sheath 44 collapsing, kinking, or bending. Preferably the sheath 44 is made out of a biocompatible plastic material and is perforated along its axial length to allow for it to split apart into two sections. The trocar 42 has a proximal handle 41 and a curved shaft 43. The distal end 45 of the trocar 42 is tapered to allow for dissection of a subcutaneous path 33 in the patient. Preferably, the trocar 42 has a central lumen 46 that terminates in an opening 48 at the distal end 45. Local anesthetic such as lidocaine can be delivered, if desired, through the lumen 46 or through a curved and elongated needle (not shown) designed to anesthetize the path to be used for trocar insertion should general anesthesia not be employed. The curved peel away sheath 44 has a proximal pull tab 49 for breaking the sheath into two halves along its axial shaft 47. The sheath 44 is placed over a guidewire (not shown) inserted through the trocar 42 after the subcutaneous path has been created and developed until it terminates subcutaneously at a location that, if a straight line were drawn from the canister location to the path termination point, the line would intersect a substantial portion of the left ventricular mass of the patient. The guidewire is then removed leaving the peel away sheath 44.",
        "The subcutaneous electrode lead assembly is then inserted through the sheath until it is in the proper location. Once the subcutaneous electrode lead assembly is in the proper location, the peel away sheath 44 is split in half using the pull tab 49 and removed. If more than one subcutaneous electrode lead assembly is being used, a new curved peel away sheath 44 can be used for each subcutaneous electrode lead assembly.",
        "The S-ICD will have prophylactic use in adults where chronic transvenous/epicardial ICD lead systems pose excessive risk or have already resulted in difficulty, such as sepsis or lead fractures. It is also contemplated that a major use of the S-ICD system of the present invention will be for prophylactic use in children who are at risk for having fatal arrhythmias, where chronic transvenous lead systems pose significant management problems. For example, with the use of standard transvenous ICDs in children, problems develop during patient growth in that the lead system does not accommodate the growth.",
        "FIG. 9 illustrates the placement of the S-ICD subcutaneous lead system such that several problems that growth presents to the lead system are overcome. The distal end of the subcutaneous electrode is placed in the same location as described above providing a good location for the coil cardioversion/defibrillation electrode 27 and the sensing electrodes 23 and 25. Again, the canister 11 is placed medial of a portion of the insulated lead 21. The insulated lead 21, however, is no longer placed in a straight configuration. Instead, the lead is serpiginously placed with a specially designed introducer trocar and sheath such that it has numerous waves or bends. As the child grows, the waves or bends will straighten out, straightening the lead system while maintaining proper electrode placement. Although it is expected that fibrous scarring especially around the coil electrode 27 will help anchor it into position to maintain its posterior position during growth, a lead system with a distal tine or screw electrode anchoring system 52 can also be incorporated into the distal tip of the lead to facilitate lead stability (see FIG. 1). Other anchoring systems can also be used such as hooks, sutures, or the like.",
        "FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate another embodiment of the present S-ICD invention. In this embodiment there are two subcutaneous electrode lead assemblies 13 and 13\u2032 of opposite polarity to the canister 11. The additional subcutaneous electrode lead assembly 13\u2032 can take any of the forms illustrated above for electrode lead assembly 13. In this embodiment the cardioversion/defibrillation energy is delivered between the active surface 15 of the canister 11 and the two coil electrodes 27 and 27\u2032. Additionally, provided in the canister 11 is means for selecting the optimum sensing arrangement between the four sense electrodes 23, 23\u2032, 25, and 25\u2032. The two electrode lead assemblies may be subcutaneously placed on the same side of the heart. As illustrated in FIG. 11, one subcutaneous electrode lead assembly 13 is placed inferiorly and the other electrode lead assembly 13\u2032 is placed superiorly. Alternatively, a dual subcutaneous lead assembly system may have the canister 11 and one of the electrode lead assemblies 13, 13\u2032 having the same polarity, with the other of the electrode lead assemblies 13\u2032, 13, having the opposite polarity. While the example placement of FIG. 11 shows the canister 11 placed in a posterior position, the canister 11 may also be placed in an anterior position as shown above in FIG. 6, with the electrode lead assemblies inserted for placement of the electrodes in an anterior position.",
        "Turning now to FIGS. 12 and 13, further embodiments are illustrated where a canister 11 is shaped for placing subcutaneously adjacent and parallel to a rib of a patient. The canister 11 is long, thin, and curved to conform to the shape of the patient's rib. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 12, the canister 11 has a diameter ranging from about 0.5 cm to about two cm with about one cm being presently preferred. Alternatively, instead of having a circular cross sectional area, the canister 11 could have a rectangular or square cross sectional area as illustrated in FIG. 13 without falling outside of the scope of the present invention. The length of the canister 11 can vary depending on the size of the patient's thorax. In some present embodiments, the canister 11 is about five cm to about fifteen cm long, with about ten cm being presently preferred. The canister 11 is curved to conform to the curvature of the ribs of the thorax. The radius of the curvature will vary depending on the size of the patient, with smaller radiuses for smaller patients and larger radiuses for larger patients. The radius of the curvature can range from about five cm to about thirty-five cm depending on the size of the patient. Additionally, the radius of the curvature need not be uniform throughout the canister such that it can be shaped closer to the shape of the ribs. The canister 11 has an active surface 15 that is located on the interior (concave) portion of the curvature and an inactive surface 16 that is located on the exterior (convex) portion of the curvature. The leads of these embodiments, which are not illustrated except for the attachment port 19 and the proximal end of the lead 21, can be any of the leads previously described above, with the lead illustrated in FIG. 1 being presently preferred.",
        "The circuitry of this canister 11 is similar to the circuitry described above. Additionally, the canister 11 can optionally have at least one sense electrode located on either the active surface 15 or the inactive surface 16 and the circuitry within the canister 11 can be programmable as described above to allow for the selection of the best sense electrodes. It is presently preferred that the canister 11 have two sense electrodes 26, 28 located on the inactive surface 16 of the canister 11 as illustrated, where the electrodes 26, 28 are spaced from about one to about ten cm apart with a spacing of about three cm being presently preferred. Alternatively, the sense electrodes 26, 28 can be located on the active surface 15 as described above.",
        "It is envisioned that the embodiment of FIG. 12 will be subcutaneously implanted adjacent and parallel to the left anterior 5th rib, either between the 4th and 5th ribs or between the 5th and 6th ribs. However other locations can be used.",
        "Another component of the S-ICD of the present invention is a cutaneous test electrode system designed to simulate the subcutaneous high voltage shock electrode system as well as the QRS cardiac rhythm detection system. This test electrode system is comprised of a cutaneous patch electrode of similar surface area and impedance to that of the S-ICD canister itself together with a cutaneous strip electrode comprising a defibrillation strip as well as two button electrodes for sensing of the QRS. Several cutaneous strip electrodes are available to allow for testing various bipole spacings to optimize signal detection comparable to the implantable system.",
        "FIGS. 14 to 18 depict several US-ICD (unitary subcutaneous implantable cardioverter/defibrillator) embodiments of the present invention. The various sensing, shocking and pacing circuitry, described in detail above with respect to the S-ICD embodiments, may additionally be incorporated into the following US-ICD embodiments. Furthermore, particular aspects of any individual S-ICD embodiments discussed above may be incorporated, in whole or in part, into the US-ICD embodiments depicted in the following figures.",
        "Turning now to FIG. 14, a US-ICD of the present invention is illustrated. The US-ICD includes a curved housing 1211 with a first end 1413 and a second end 1215. The first end 1413 is thicker than the second end 1215. This thicker area houses a battery supply, capacitor and operational circuitry for the US-ICD. The circuitry will be able to monitor cardiac rhythms for tachycardia and fibrillation, and if detected, will initiate charging the capacitor and then delivering cardioversion/defibrillation energy through two cardioversion/defibrillating electrodes 1417 and 1219 located on the outer surface of the two ends of the housing. The circuitry can provide cardioversion/defibrillation energy in different types of waveforms. In the preferred embodiment, a biphasic waveform is used of approximately 10-20 ms total duration and with the initial phase containing approximately \u2154 of the energy, however, any type of waveform can be utilized such as monophasic, biphasic, multiphasic or alternative waveforms known in the art.",
        "The housing of the illustrative embodiment can be made out of titanium alloy, for example, or other materials. It is contemplated that the housing may also be made out of biocompatible plastic materials that electrically insulate the electrodes 1219, 1417 from each other. However, it is contemplated that a malleable canister that can conform to the curvature of the patient's chest will be preferred. In this way the patient can have a comfortable canister that conforms to the unique shape of the patient's rib cage. Examples of conforming ICD housings are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 5,645,586, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. In the preferred embodiment, the housing is curved in the shape of a 5th rib of a person. Because there are many different sizes of people, the housing may come in different incremental sizes to allow a good match between the size of the rib cage and the size of the US-ICD. The length of the US-ICD will range from about fifteen to about fifty cm. Because of the primary preventative role of the therapy and the need to reach energies over forty Joules, in the preferred embodiment, the charge time for the therapeutic shock is intentionally long in order to allow capacitor charging using components that fit within the limitations of device size.",
        "The thick end 1412 of the housing 1211 is currently needed to allow for the placement of the battery supply, operational circuitry, and capacitors. It is contemplated that the thick end 1412 will be about 0.5 cm to about two cm wide with about one cm being presently preferred. As micro technology advances, the thickness of the housing 1211 will become smaller.",
        "The two cardioversion/defibrillation electrodes 1219, 1417 on the housing 1211 are used for delivering cardioversion/defibrillation energy across the heart. In the preferred embodiment, the electrodes 1219, 1417 are coil electrodes. However, other cardioversion/defibrillation electrodes could be used, for example, using electrically isolated active surfaces or platinum alloy electrodes. The coil electrodes 1219, 1417 are about five to ten cm in length. Located on the housing between the two cardioversion/defibrillation electrodes 1219, 1417 are two sense electrodes 1425, 1427. The sense electrodes 1425, 1427 are spaced far enough apart to be able to have good QRS detection. This spacing can range from one to ten cm with four cm being presently preferred. The electrodes 1425, 1427 may or may not be circumferential with the preferred embodiment. Having the electrodes 1425, 1427 non-circumferential and positioned outward, toward the skin surface, may reduce muscle artifacts and enhance QRS signal quality. The sensing electrodes 1425, 1427 are electrically isolated from the cardioversion/defibrillation electrodes 1219, 1417 via insulating areas 1423. Analogous types of cardioversion/defibrillation electrodes are currently commercially available in a transvenous configuration. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,534,022, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference, discloses a composite electrode with a coil cardioversion/defibrillation electrode and sense electrodes.",
        "Several modifications to the arrangement of FIG. 14 are contemplated within the scope of the invention. One such modification is to have the sense electrodes 1425, 1427 at the two ends of the housing 1211 and have the cardioversion/defibrillation electrodes 1219, 1417 located in between the sense electrodes 1425, 1427. Another modification is to have three or more sense electrodes spaced throughout the housing 1211 and allow for the selection of the two best sensing electrodes. If three or more sensing electrodes are used, then the ability to change which electrodes are used for sensing would be a programmable feature of the US-ICD to adapt to changes in the patient physiology and size over time. The programming could be done via the use of physical switches on the canister, or as presently preferred, via the use of a programming wand or via a wireless connection to program the circuitry within the canister.",
        "Turning now to FIG. 15, a preferred subcutaneous placement of the US-ICD of the present invention is illustrated. As would be evident to a person skilled in the art, the actual location of the US-ICD is in a subcutaneous space that is developed during the implantation process. The heart is not exposed during this process and the heart is schematically illustrated in the figures only for help in understanding where the device and its various electrodes are located with reference to the heart. The US-ICD housing 1211 is shown located between the left mid-clavicular line approximately at the level of the inframammary crease at approximately the 5th rib and the posterior axillary line, ideally just lateral to the left scapula. This way the US-ICD provides a reasonably good pathway for current delivery to the majority of the ventricular myocardium.",
        "FIG. 16 schematically illustrates the method for implanting the US-ICD of the present invention. An incision 1631 is made in the left anterior axillary line approximately at the level of the cardiac apex. A subcutaneous pathway is then created that extends posteriorly to allow placement of the US-ICD. The incision can be anywhere on the thorax deemed reasonable by the implanting physician although in the preferred embodiment, the US-ICD of the present invention will be applied in this region. The subcutaneous pathway is created medially to the inframammary crease and extends posteriorly to the left posterior axillary line. The pathway is preferably developed with a specially designed curved introducer 1742 (further illustrated below in FIG. 17).",
        "Referring now to FIG. 17, introducer 1742 is a trocar having a proximal handle 1641 and a curved shaft 1643. The distal end 1745 of the introducer 1742 is tapered to allow for dissection of a subcutaneous path in the patient. Preferably, the introducer 1742 is cannulated having a central lumen 1746 and terminating in an opening 1748 at the distal end 1745. Local anesthetic such as lidocaine can be delivered, if necessary, through the lumen 1746 or through a curved and elongated needle designed to anesthetize the path to be used for trocar insertion, if general anesthesia is not employed. Once the subcutaneous pathway is developed, the US-ICD is implanted in the subcutaneous space, and the incision is closed using standard techniques.",
        "As described previously, the US-ICDs of the present invention vary in length and curvature. The US-ICDs are provided in incremental sizes for subcutaneous implantation in different sized patients. Turning now to FIG. 18, a different embodiment is schematically illustrated in exploded view which provides different sized US-ICDs that are easier to manufacture. The different sized US-ICDs will all have the same sized and shaped thick end 1413. The thick end is hollow inside allowing for the insertion of a core operational member 1853. The core member comprises a housing 1857 which contains the battery supply, capacitor and operational circuitry for the US-ICD. The proximal end of the core member has a plurality of electronic plug connectors. Plug connectors 1861 and 1863 are electronically connected to the sense electrodes via pressure fit connectors (not illustrated) inside the thick end which are standard in the art. Plug connectors 1865 and 1867 are also electronically connected to the cardioverter/defibrillator electrodes via pressure fit connectors inside the thick end. The distal end of the core member comprises an end cap 1855, and a ribbed fitting 1859 which creates a water-tight seal when the core member is inserted into opening 1851 of the thick end of the US-ICD.",
        "The core member of the different sized and shaped US-ICD will all be the same size and shape. That way, during an implantation procedure, multiple sized US-ICDs can be available for implantation, each one without a core member. Once the implantation procedure is being performed, then the correct sized US-ICD can be selected and the core member can be inserted into the US-ICD and then programmed as described above. Another advantage of this configuration is when the battery within the core member needs replacing it can be done without removing the entire US-ICD.",
