        "United States Patent Application No. 20050239325 (Cook), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, allegedly recites that a \u201cmodular meter socket is releasably mountable in a housing. Support clips are disposed in the housing by fixing a mounting plate carrying the clips in the enclosure. A mounting panel fixedly carries the meter socket and is attached to the clips without the use of tools operative fasteners or additional fasteners. Alternately, a meter socket and a bypass device are unitarily mounted on a mounting panel for attachment to the clips in the housing. The meter socket and the bypass device may be mounted on separate panels, each attached to the clips in the housing without additional fasteners.\u201d See Abstract.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,388,670 (Billhartz), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, allegedly recites that a \u201cwatthour meter socket assembly of the type which engages the blades of a watthour meter. The blades are frictionally held by pairs of spring-loaded conductive jaws, which form the female contacts of the socket assembly. Helper springs are provided to increase the biasing of the jaws. In order to provide a conductive bypass when the meter is removed for servicing or replacement a reciprocable, conductive blade is mounted on a slide mechanism so that it can be wedged between the jaws. The wedging action simultaneously spreads the jaws apart, allowing removal of the meter.\u201d See Abstract.",

The socket assembly comprises a plurality of power line connectors for connection to electric power lines of an electric power line system and a meter bypass system. Each power line connector comprises a jaw, a jaw support and first and second sockets. The jaw support comprises a base, a jaw mount having spaced apart flanges and a contact arm. The base, jaw mount and contact arm are formed as a one-piece metal structure to provide a joint-free path for flow of electrical current. The first socket is formed between the jaw and jaw mount for receiving an electrical connector of the electric meter. The second socket is formed between the jaw and contact arm for receiving a slide connector of a bypass system. The slide connector is slidable between a meter operating position and a meter bypass position.\u201d See Abstract.",

Via air space 20400 and/or crush rib 20300, the bypass hub, comprising blade retainer 20200 and the second blade retainer, can be characterized by dielectric properties compliant with a predetermined standard, such as an Underwriters Laboratory standard. Air space 20400 can be maintained between an electrically conductive blade and handle 20100.",
        "FIG. 18 is a detail view of a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a system 21000, which can correspond to detail C of system 16000 of FIG. 13.",
        "FIG. 19 is a flowchart of an exemplary embodiment of a method 22000. At activity 22100, an electrically conductive blade can be obtained. The electrically conductive blade can be made of an electrically conductive material such as copper, steel, aluminum, brass, and/or bronze, etc.",
        "At activity 22200, two or more blade retainers can be obtained. The blade retainers can be made and/or fabricated from a relatively electrically non-conductive material such as Teflon, nylon, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, and/or polymeric material, etc. In exemplary operative embodiments, the blade retainers can serve as an electrical insulator between the blade and a handle or lever. The handle or lever can be adapted to electrically couple and/or decouple an electrical meter to an energy source associated with a blade retainer system.",
        "At activity 22300, one or more blades can be mechanically coupled to two or more blade retainers. For example, a prong of a first blade retainer can be snapably coupled to a receiver of a second blade retainer. In embodiments wherein the first blade retainer is substantially similar to the second blade retainer, a prong of the second blade retainer can be snapably coupled to a receiver of the first blade retainer. In certain exemplary embodiments, the first blade retainer can define a protrusion and a first recess. The second blade retainer can have a protrusion and a receiver that correspond to those of the first blade retainer. The protrusion of the first blade retainer can engage with the recess of the second blade retainer. The protrusion of the second blade retainer can be adapted to engage with the recess of the first blade retainer.",
        "At activity 22400, a handle can be obtained. The handle can be an electrically conductive handle that comprises steel, aluminum, copper, tin, brass, bronze, and/or stainless steel, etc.",
        "At activity 22500, blade retainer assemblies can be coupled to the shaft.",
        "At activity 22600, the bypass hub assembly can be installed in an electrical panel. In certain exemplary embodiments, the bypass hub assembly can be sufficiently strong to resist damage that might be caused by torque applied to the handle when a user operates the handle. In certain exemplary embodiments, the bypass hub assembly can be sufficiently strong to resist a dielectric breakdown that might be caused by torque applied to the handle when a user operates the handle.",
        "At activity 22700, an electrical meter can be obtained. The electrical meter can be adapted to measure, directly or indirectly, a flow of electrical energy from an electrical energy source to an electrical energy load.",
        "At activity 22800, the electrical meter can be installed in the electrical panel. For example, the electrically meter can be pluggably attached to a plurality of sockets, each of which can comprise a spring-loaded jaw. The plurality of spring loaded jaw sockets can be adapted to mechanically and electrically couple the electrical meter to an electrical panel.",
        "At activity 22900, the electrical meter can be removed from the electrical panel via an engagement of the bypass hub assembly. In certain exemplary embodiments, the electrical meter can be removed without interrupting a flow of electrical energy to a load electrically coupled to an electrical circuit associated with the meter. The electrical meter can be removed by a qualified and/or certified person",
