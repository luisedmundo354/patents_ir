        "The second sub-housing 18 is mounted to an interior surface 20 of model train 22 and houses a fan 32 of blower 14 for directing an air stream through the housing 10. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, fan 32 is a squirrel cage fan. However, fan 32 can also be any type of fan including, but not limited to, an axial fan, a radial flow fan, a mixed flow fan or a cross-flow fan.

However, the invention can be practiced with the fan 32 and the motor 34 positioned internally with respect to the second sub-housing 18. Rotation of fan 32 draws the air stream through an aperture 36 of model train 22.

A conduit can be positioned between the aperture 36 and the second sub-housing 18, placing the aperture 36 and the second sub-housing 18 in fluid communication with respect to each other. The air stream is directed through openings 30 and 28 into first sub-housing 16.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 5, a schematic circuit diagram is provided showing the preferred electric circuit of an embodiment of the present invention. Controller 46 is a micro-controller operable to receive input signals and emit output signals and can be an PIC12C508 chip. The controller 46 is in communication with the engine of the train through a serial communication line 53 including the input connector 52. Serial communication line 53 transmits a wide variety of information with regard to model train 22. This information can include but is not limited to the velocity of train 22. Communication between the controller 46 and the input connector 52 can be enhanced with a protection resistor 66. The voltage across the engine of the train is communicated to the controller 46 with serial communication line 53. Based on a program stored in memory, the controller 46 can control the operation of the motor 34 to control an airstream generated by the fan. The controller 46 can control a rate of the airstream. The direction of the motor 34 can be controlled by alternating the voltage across the motor 34 with an H-bridge formed with a pair of chips 60 and 62. The chips 60 and 62 can be XN4316 chips and can be controlled by the controller 46. The velocity of the motor 34 can be changed by changing the level of voltage across the motor 34 with the controller 46. The circuit also includes a voltage stabilizer defined by diode 56, capacitor 58 and regulator 64. The circuit also includes an element 50 that can control a lamp or relay when a command is received.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 6, the method for generating smoke begins at step 70. At 76, the loading on the train is determined. The controller 46 can receive input from the communication line corresponding to the loading on the engine model train. The loading on the model train can correspond to a voltage across an engine of the model train or a speed at which the model train is moving. As seen in FIG. 4, The controller 46 can communicate with a sensor 47 engaged with a wheel 49 of the model train 22. The sensor 47 can sense the angular velocity of the wheel 49 and communicate the speed of the wheel 49 to the controller 46.",
        "Referring to FIG. 6, At 78, the appropriate angular velocity of the fan is determined by the controller in accordance with a control program stored in memory. In FIG. 7, an illustrative graph is provided to show movement of the fan over time to produce a puffing pattern of smoke. A puff of smoke is emitted from an aperture of the model train. The time period lasting from T1 to T2 is the duration of a puff of smoke. The time period lasting from T2 to T3 is the interval between puffs of smoke. Preferably, the fan can be engaged at velocity V1 in as short a period of time as possible, represented by a substantially vertical line L1 on the graph. Also, the fan 32 can preferably be disengaged from velocity V1 to zero velocity in as short a period of time as possible, represented by a substantially vertical line L2 on the graph. More specifically the smoke unit stops the fan by temporarily reversing the current to motor. By temporarily reversing the current the fan stops abruptly thereby enhancing the puffing action of the smoke unit. As the time periods required to engage the fan up to velocity V1 and disengage the fan 32 down from velocity V1 decrease, a relatively more well defined puff of smoke will be emitted from the aperture of the train.",
        "As the loading on the train increases, the controller can move the fan at a greater angular velocity, or increase the duration of puffs of smoke, or shorten the duration between puffs of smoke. For example, for a train modeled after a steam locomotive that puffs smoke, the puffs of smoke can be generated at increasing intervals as train speed increases and can be generated at decreasing intervals as the train speed decreases. Alternatively, the puffs of smoke can be generated at increasing intervals as engine load increases and can be generated at decreasing intervals as the engine load decreases. For a train modeled after a diesel engine that does not emit smoke in a puffing pattern, more smoke can be generated as the train speed increases and less smoke can be generated as the train speed decreases. Alternatively, more smoke can be generated as engine load increases and less smoke can be generated as engine load decreases. Referring now to FIGS. 8 and 9, graphs are provide to show that the time between puffs decreases as loading on the train increases. Also, the duration of individual puffs of smoke increases as loading on the engine increases.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 6, at step 80 the controller engages the motor to rotate the fan at the desired angular velocity. After the fan has been engaged at the desired velocity, the process returns to step 76 to determine loading on the engine. The controller can continuously monitor the loading on the engine or can monitor the loading on the engine at predetermined intervals. For example, the controller can be operable to monitor the loading on the train every five seconds, every ten seconds or any time period desired.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 10, the present invention provides an apparatus 112 for forming smoke to be emitted by an amusement device, the apparatus comprising a support member 114 and a smoke generating element 116 having a length and an outer surface 118, the support member 114 in contact with the smoke generating element 116 along at least part of the length and in contact with less than the entire outer surface for the at least part of the length.",
        "In FIG. 10, the entire length of the smoke generating element 116 contacts the support member 114 at a portion 120 of the outer surface 118 of the smoke generating element 116. However, the invention is not so limited. In particular, the smoke generating element 116 can be formed to extend beyond an end 124 of the support member 114. In such an embodiment of the invention, the support member 114 would be in contact with the smoke generating element 116 less than the entire length of the smoke generating element 116.",
        "To the extent that the support member 114 contacts the smoke generating element 116, the contact occurs at portion 120 of the outer surface. As shown in FIG. 11, the portion 120 is less than the entire outer surface 118. The smoke generating element 116 is shown having a generally circular cross-section (shown elliptical in FIG. 11 due to the choice of cross-sectional plane). Portion 120 is shown as a point. However, the smoke generating element 116 can have a non-circular cross-section including a portion 120 having a predetermined width.",
        "As shown in FIG. 10, a smoke generating element 116 extends along a generally helical path around a support member 114. Support member 114 is shown having a rectangular cross-section, so the smoke generating element 116 is not a true helix. However, in an embodiment where support member 114 is cylindrical, the smoke generating element 116 can be formed in the shape of a true helix.",
        "Apparatus 112 includes a support member 114 for supporting the smoke generating element 116. It is believed that the position of the support member 114 relative to the smoke generating element 116 enhances and prolongs the operating life of the smoke generating element 116.",
        "The support member 114 has a predetermined length and can have a rectangular cross-section. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 12, the support member 114a can have a circular cross-section including an aperture 126 extending the length of the support member 114a. The aperture 126 can be formed to extend a predetermined distance through the support member 114a, a distance less than the length of the support member 114a, or can be formed to extend the length of the support member 114a. The support member 114 can be formed having any cross-section, including an irregular geometric cross-section. The support member 114 can be formed to have different or inconsistent cross-sections, such as partially cylindrical and partially rectangular with blending portions. In FIG. 10, the support member 114 is shown having a consistent, rectangular cross-section along the entire length of the support member 114. Furthermore, the cross-section of the support member 114 can be constant along the length of the support member 114 or can be variable, such as two differently-sized rectangular cross sections. In FIG. 10, the support member 114 is shown having a constant, rectangular cross-section along the entire length of the support member 114.",
        "The length and cross-section of the support member 114 can be varied to enhance the resistive properties of the apparatus 112. For example, a relatively longer support member 114 can support a relatively longer smoke generating element 116 having a greater resistance than a relatively shorter smoke generating element 116. A relatively thicker support member 114 can support a relatively longer smoke generating element 116 having a greater resistance than a relatively shorter smoke generating element 116. Preferably, the electrical resistance across the apparatus is 6.3 ohms, plus or minus five percent, at twenty-five (25) degrees Celsius.",
        "The support member 114 can be fabricated from a non-conductive material capable of maintaining a rigid or semi-rigid form up to a temperature of 530\u00b0 Celsius. Preferably, the support member 114 is fabricated from braided fiberglass. Preferably, in a rectangular embodiment of the support member 114, the support member is 3.2 millimeters wide and 0.25 millimeters thick. Preferably, in a tube-shaped support member 114a, as shown in FIG. 12, the inside diameter of the support member 114a is 3.2 millimeters and the wall thickness is 0.25 millimeters.",
        "The smoke generating element 116 is supported by the support member 114 along at least part of the length of the smoke generating element 116. The smoke generating element 116 can be a nickel chromium wire. Preferably, the smoke generating element 116 is fabricated from an alloy of 61% nickel, 15% chromium and 24% iron. Preferably, the wire is 0.25 millimeters in diameter. The smoke generating element 116 is in electrical communication with an electrical power source (not shown) to heat the smoke generating element 116 and burn oil or smoke fluid to form smoke.",
        "The smoke generating element 116 can extends along a generally helical path around the support member 114. The lead of the helix and the development of the helix can be varied as desired to modify the resistance across the apparatus 112. In particular, the number of turns the smoke generating element 116 completes around the support member 114 over a length of the support member 114 and the distance between adjacent turns 128 and 130 can be increased or decreased to change the resistance across the smoke generating element 112.",
        "The distance between turns 128 and 130 can be constant along the length of the support member 114 are be varied. For example, as shown in FIG. 13, the apparatus 112 can be positioned in a sub-housing 216. The sub-housing 216 can be positioned in a model train 222. A model train 222 includes an aperture 224 adjacent the apparatus 112 in the sub-housing 216, the aperture for dispensing smoke fluid or oil in the sub-housing 216. The turns of the smoke generating element 116 around the support member 114 can be relatively closer at a position adjacent the aperture 224 to enhance the likelihood that smoke fluid contacts the smoke generating element 116. The turns can be spaced further apart at other positions along the length of the support member 114 where smoke fluid is unlikely to contact.",
        "The apparatus 112 can also include at least one terminal 132 to immovably associate the support member 114 with respect to the amusement device, such as a model train 222. Preferably, the apparatus includes two terminals 132 and 134 disposed at opposite ends of the support member 114. The terminals 132 and 134 can be fabricated from brass and can include apertures 136 and 138, respectively, for receiving additional mounting means such as a screw, bolt, or pin 120 as shown in FIG. 13.",
        "The terminals 132 and 134 can be permanently connected to the support member 114 or releasibly associated. The terminals 132 and 134 shown in FIG. 10 include projections 140 and 142. The projections 140 and 142 are disposed about the support member 114. The projections 140 and 142 can be bent or crimped around the support member 114.",
        "The smoke generating element 116 can be disposed between the support member 114 and either terminal 132 or 134. In addition, the smoke generating element 116 can be disposed between the support member 114 and the individual terminal at both ends of the support member 114. Preferably, the terminals 132 and 134 are sufficiently wide to engage at least two turns of the smoke generating element 116 about the support member 114 as shown in FIG. 10. Electric communication between the terminals 132 and 134 and the smoke generating element 116 is enhanced when at least two turns of the smoke generating element 116 are in disposed between the support member 114 and the terminals 132 and 134. Furthermore, the stability of the smoke generating element 116 with respect to the support member 114 is enhanced when two turns of the smoke generating element 116 are positioned between the support element 114 and the terminals 132 or 134.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 13, the first sub-housing 216 can include a lamina 226. Lamina 226 is a thin plate, scale or layer made of fibrous material to absorb the oil directed into the first sub-housing 216 through the aperture 224. Lamina 226 can absorb and retain oil to be heated by the apparatus 112. Lamina 226 is operable to withstand the maximum thermal energy generated by the apparatus 112.",
        "A second sub-housing 218 is mounted to an interior surface 220 of model train 222 and houses a fan 232 of a blower 214 for directing an air stream through the sub-housing 216. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the fan 232 is a squirrel cage fan. However, the fan 232 can also be any type of fan including, but not limited to, an axial fan, a radial flow fan, a mixed flow fan or a cross-flow fan. Fan 232 is positioned internally with respect to the second sub-housing 218. A motor 234 for rotating the fan 232 is positioned externally with respect to the second sub-housing 218. However, the invention can be practiced with the fan 232 and the motor 234 positioned internally with respect to the second sub-housing 218. Rotation of fan 232 draws the air stream through an aperture 236 of model train 222. While the aperture 236 is shown positioned adjacent the second sub-housing 218, the invention can be practiced with aperture 236 positioned spaced apart from the second sub-housing 218. A conduit can be positioned between the aperture 236 and the second sub-housing 218, placing the aperture 236 and the second sub-housing 218 in fluid communication with respect to each other. The air stream is directed through openings 230 and 228 into sub-housing 216.",
        "A controller 246 is a micro-controller operable to receive input signals and emit output signals and can be an PIC12C508 chip. The controller 246 is in communication with the engine 248 of the train. The voltage across the engine of the train is communicated to the controller 246 and, based on a program stored in memory, the controller 246 can control the operation of the motor 234 to control an airstream generated by the fan 232. The controller 246 can control a rate of the airstream. The direction of the motor 234 can be controlled by alternating the voltage across the motor 234. The velocity of the motor 234 can be changed by changing the level of voltage across the motor 234 with the controller 246.",
        "The controller 246 can receive input corresponding to the loading on the engine model train. The loading on the model train can correspond to a voltage across an engine of the model train or a speed at which the model train is moving. The controller 246 can communicate with a sensor 247 engaged with a wheel 249 of the model train 222. The sensor 247 can sense the angular velocity of the wheel 249 and communicate the speed of the wheel 249 to the controller 246. The controller 246 can then control the speed of the fan 232 in response to the angular velocity of the wheel 249 detected by the sensor 247.",
        "While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiments but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims, which scope is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures as is permitted under the law."
