    "abstract": "In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that introduction of hydrophilic sulfoalkyl substituents and/or hydrophilic linkers derived from homocysteic acid, cysteic acid, glycine peptides, tetraethylene oxide, and the like, offset the hydrophobicity of the acridinium ring system to produce a more soluble label which can be attached to an antibody at higher loading before precipitation and aggregation problems are encountered. Additional compounds described herein contain linkers derived from short peptides and tetraethylene oxide which increase aqueous solubility due to hydrogen bonding with water molecules. The present invention also embraces reagents for multiple acridinium labeling for signal amplification composed of a peptide bearing several acridinium esters with sulfonate groups at regularly spaced intervals for increased solubility. The invention also embraces assays employing the above-described compounds.",

        "The present invention relates to amine-reactive acridinium labeling reagents. In a particular aspect, the present invention relates to acridinium labeling reagents having one or more hydrophilic substituents thereon. In another aspect, the present invention relates to conjugates containing invention acridinium labeling reagents, kits containing same, and assays employing same.",
        "The following description of the background of the invention is provided simply as an aid in understanding the invention and is not admitted to describe or constitute prior art to the invention.",
        "Chemiluminescence immunoassays which employ acridinium labels have advantages of high throughput and high analytical sensitivity for low-level analytes of clinical significance. Usually it is desirable to use labeled antibodies with a large number of chemiluminescent tags, which produce high luminescence counts, which, in turn, allows one to achieve lower detection limits. This holds true provided that non-specific binding can be minimized.",
        "During conjugation of antibodies with presently available labeling reagents at relatively high reagent-to-protein ratios, low recoveries of the labeled proteins are often obtained. In most of these labeling reactions, protein precipitation and/or formation of protein aggregates have been observed. Presumably, the precipitates and aggregates are the result of protein molecules with higher degree of labeling than the immunologically active conjugates, which remain in solution. The tendency towards precipitation and aggregation can be attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the four-ring aromatic acridinium ester label.",
        "Accordingly, there is a need in the art for acridinium labeling reagents which have a reduced propensity to cause protein precipitation and/or promote formation of protein aggregates.",
        "In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that introduction of hydrophilic sulfoalkyl substituents and/or hydrophilic linkers derived from homocysteic acid, cysteic acid, glycine peptides, tetraethylene oxide, and the like, offset the hydrophobicity of the acridinium ring system to produce a more soluble label which can be attached to an antibody at higher loading before precipitation and aggregation problems are encountered.",
        "Additional compounds described herein contain linkers derived from short peptides and tetraethylene oxide which increase aqueous solubility due to hydrogen bonding with water molecules. The present invention also embraces reagents for multiple acridinium labeling for signal amplification composed of a peptide bearing several acridinium esters with sulfonate groups at regularly spaced intervals for increased solubility.",
        "In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there are provided assays for the presence of an analyte in a sample, said assay comprising:\n\n    \n    \n        contacting an analyte with an invention conjugate,\n        inducing chemiluminescence by decay of an intermediate formable in the presence of a peroxide or molecular oxygen, and\n        measuring chemiluminescence therefrom to assay the analyte.",
        "In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, there are provided improved diagnostic assays for the detection of an analyte using a chemiluminescent label conjugated to a specific binding material, the improvement comprising employing an invention compound as the chemiluminescent label compound.",
        "The summary of the invention described above is not limiting and other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, as well as from the claims.",

Specific binding materials contemplated for use in the practice of the present invention include antibodies, enzymes and substrates therefor, antibodies and antigens therefor, avidin-biotin, nucleic acids, and the like.",
        "Invention chemiluminescent compounds are useful in a broad range of specific binding assays for the presence of analyte in a sample. \u201cPresence\u201d shall mean herein the qualitative and/or quantitative detection of an analyte. Such assays may be directed at any analyte which may be detected by use of the improved chemiluminescent compound in conjunction with specific binding reactions to form a moiety thereon. These assays include, without limitation, immunoassays, protein binding assays and nucleic acid hybridization assays.",
        "In a typical immunoassay, the analyte is immunoreactive and its presence in a sample may be determined by virtue of its immunoreaction with an assay reagent. In a typical protein binding assay, the presence of analyte in a sample is determined by the specific binding reactivity of the analyte with an assay reagent where the reactivity is other than immunoreactivity. Examples of alternative specific binding reactions for use in assays include enzyme-substrate recognition and the binding affinity of avidin for biotin. In the typical nucleic acid hybridization assay, the presence of analyte in a sample is determined by a hybridization reaction of the analyte with an assay reagent. Analyte nucleic acid (usually present as double stranded DNA or RNA) is usually first converted to a single stranded form and immobilized onto a carrier (e.g., nitrocellulose paper). The analyte nucleic acid may alternatively be electrophoresed into a gel matrix. The immobilized analyte may then be hybridized (i.e., specifically bound) by a complementary sequence of nucleic acid.",
        "The foregoing specific binding assays may be performed in a wide variety of assay formats. These assay formats fall within two broad categories. In the first category, the assay utilizes an invention chemiluminescent conjugate which comprises a chemiluminescent moiety of the invention attached to a specific binding material. In this category of assays, the invention chemiluminescent conjugate participates in a specific binding reaction and the presence of analyte in the sample is proportional to the formation of one or more specific binding reaction products containing the invention chemiluminescent conjugate. The assay is performed by allowing the requisite specific binding reactions to occur under suitable reaction conditions. The formation of specific binding reaction products containing the invention chemiluminescent conjugate is determined by measuring the chemiluminescence of such products containing the invention chemiluminescent conjugate or by measuring the chemiluminescence of unreacted or partially reacted invention chemiluminescent conjugate not contained in such products.",
        "This first category of assay formats is illustrated by sandwich assays, competitive assays, surface antigen assays, sequential saturation assays, competitive displacement assays and quenching assays.",
        "In a sandwich format, the specific binding material to which the chemiluminescent moiety is attached is capable of specifically binding with an analyte of interest. The assay further utilizes a reactant which is capable of specifically binding with the analyte to form a reactant-analyte-chemiluminescent conjugate complex. The reactant may be attached to a solid phase, including without limitation, dip sticks, beads, tubes, paper, polymer sheets, and the like. In such cases, the presence of analyte in a sample will be proportional to the chemiluminescence of the solid phase after the specific binding reactions are completed. Such assay formats are discussed further in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,652,533, 4,383,031, 4,380,580 and 4,226,993, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, including all figures, tables, and claims.",
        "In a competitive format, the assay utilizes a reactant which is capable of specifically binding with the analyte to form an analyte-reactant complex and with the specific binding material, to which a chemiluminescent moiety of the invention is attached, to form a chemiluminescent conjugate-reactant complex. The reactant may be attached to a solid phase, or alternatively reaction products containing the reactant may be precipitated by use of a second antibody or by other known means. In this competitive format, the presence of analyte is \u201cproportional,\u201d i.e., inversely proportional, to the chemiluminescence of the solid phase or precipitate. A further discussion of this assay format may be found in the immediately above mentioned U.S. patents.",
        "In another assay format, the analyte may occur on or be bound to a larger biological, biochemical or chemical species. This type of format is illustrated by a surface antigen assay. In this format, the specific binding material is capable of specifically binding with the analyte and the presence of analyte is proportional to the analyte-chemiluminescent conjugate complex formed as a reaction product. This is illustrated by attaching a chemiluminescent moiety of the invention to an antibody which is specific to a surface antigen on a cell. The presence of the cell surface antigen will be indicated by the chemiluminescence of the cells after the completion of the reaction. The cells themselves may be used in conjunction with a filtration system to separate the analyte-chemiluminescent conjugate complex which is formed on the surface of the cell from unreacted chemiluminescent conjugate. This is discussed further in U.S. Pat. No. 4,652,533.",
        "Chemiluminescent moieties of the invention may be used in additional assay formats known in the art including without limitation sequential saturation and competitive displacement, both of which utilize a chemiluminescent conjugate where both (1) the specific binding material, to which the moiety is attached, and (2) the analyte, specifically bind with a reactant. In the case of sequential saturation, the analyte is reacted with the reactant first, followed by reaction of the chemiluminescent conjugate with the remaining unreacted reactant. In the case of competitive displacement, the chemiluminescent conjugate competitively displaces analyte which has already bound to the reactant.",
        "In a quenching format, the assay utilizes a reactant which is capable of specifically binding with (i) the analyte to form an analyte-reactant complex, and (ii) with the specific binding material to which the chemiluminescent moiety is attached to form a chemiluminescent conjugate-reactant complex. A quenching moiety is attached to the reactant. When brought into close proximity to the chemiluminescent moiety, the quenching moiety reduces or quenches the chemiluminescence of the chemiluminescent moiety. In this quenching format, the presence of analyte is proportional to the chemiluminescence of the chemiluminescent moiety. A further discussion of this format may be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,220,450 and 4,277,437, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, including all figures, tables, and claims.",
        "In consideration of the above discussed assay formats, and in the formats to be discussed below, the order in which assay reagents are added and reacted may vary widely as is well known in the art. For example, in a sandwich assay, the reactant bound to a solid phase may be reacted with an analyte contained in a sample and after this reaction the solid phase containing complexed analyte may be separated from the remaining sample. After this separation step, the chemiluminescent conjugate may be reacted with the complex on the solid phase. Alternatively, the solid phase, sample and chemiluminescent conjugate may be added together simultaneously and reacted prior to separation. As a still further alternative, the analyte in the sample and the chemiluminescent conjugate may be reacted prior to addition of the reactant on the solid phase. Similar variations in the mixing and reaction steps are possible for competitive assay formats as well as other formats known in the art. \u201cAllowing under suitable conditions substantial formation\u201d of specific binding reaction products shall herein include the many different variations on the order of addition and reaction of assay reagents.",
        "In the second category of assay formats, the assay utilizes an unconjugated chemiluminescent compound of the invention. The presence of analyte in the sample is proportional to the formation of one or more specific binding reaction products which do not themselves contain the chemiluminescent moiety. Instead, the chemiluminescent compound chemiluminesces in proportion to the formation of such reaction products.",
        "In one example of this second category of assays, the assay utilizes a reactant capable of binding with the analyte to form an analyte-reactant complex which causes the chemiluminescent compound to chemiluminesce. This is illustrated by a simple enzyme-substrate assay in which the analyte is the substrate glucose and the reactant is the enzyme glucose oxidase. Formation of the enzyme-substrate complex triggers the chemiluminescent compound. Such enzyme-substrate assay for glucose is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,964,870 and 4,427,770, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, including all figures, tables, and claims. This enzyme-substrate assay is a specific binding assay in the sense that the substrate specifically binds to the active site of the enzyme in much the same way that an antigen binds to an antibody. In this assay, the enzyme specifically binds with the substrate which results in the production of peroxide which, in turn, causes the chemiluminescent compound to chemiluminesce.",
        "Also included in the second category of assays are those assays in which the formation of the reaction products promotes or inhibits chemiluminescence by the chemiluminescent compound in a less direct manner. In this assay, a first reactant, which is cross reactive with the analyte, is attached to an enzyme such as glucose oxidase close to its active site: A second reactant which is specific for both the analyte and the immunoreactive material is added to the sample and the altered enzyme in the presence of the substrate (i.e., glucose). When the second reactant binds to the first reactant located near the active site on the enzyme, the second reactant blocks the active site in a way that the substrate cannot bind to the enzyme at the active site, or the binding of the substrate at the active site is significantly decreased. The second reactant blocking the enzyme in this manner inhibits the enzyme from producing peroxide which, in turn, would have triggered the chemiluminescent moiety. Analyte in the sample, however, will tie up the second reactant, thus preventing the second reactant from inhibiting the production of peroxide. The presence of analyte will be proportional to the chemiluminescence of the compound.",
        "The assays contained in the above two categories of assay formats may be heterogeneous or homogeneous. In heterogeneous assays, the reaction products, whose formation is proportional to the presence of analyte in the sample, are separated from other products of the reaction. Separation can be achieved by any means, including without limitation, separation of a liquid phase from a solid phase by filtration, microfiltration, double antibody precipitation, centrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, removal of a solid phase (e.g., a dip stick) from a sample solution or electrophoresis. For example, in a sandwich assay the reactant-analyte-chemiluminescent conjugate complex is separated from unreacted chemiluminescent conjugate. In a surface antigen assay, the analyte-chemiluminescent conjugate complex is separated from unreacted chemiluminescent conjugate. In a competitive assay, the reactant-chemiluminescent conjugate complex is separated from unreacted chemiluminescent conjugate. In a sequential saturation assay and in a competitive displacement assay, the reactant-chemiluminescent conjugate complex is separated from unreacted chemiluminescent conjugate. Alternatively, in homogeneous assays the reaction products are not separated. After the assay reagents have been allowed to react, the chemiluminescence may be measured from the whole assay mixture whether such mixture is in solution, on a solid phase or distributed between various membrane layers of a dip stick or other solid support. The glucose assay using glucose oxidase and a chemiluminescent moiety illustrates a simple homogeneous assay in which separation is unnecessary. The quenching assay illustrates a more complex homogeneous assay in which separation is unnecessary.",
        "Finally, \u201cmeasuring the chemiluminescence\u201d shall include, where relevant, the act of separating those specific binding reaction products, the formation of which are proportional to the presence of analyte in the sample, from other reaction products. It shall also include, where relevant, the acts of (i) treating the chemiluminescent moiety with acid to cleave an acid labile group from the moiety, and/or (ii) triggering the chemiluminescent moiety to chemiluminesce in the case of those assay formats in which the formation of the reaction products does not itself trigger the chemiluminescent moiety.",
        "In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, there are provided chemiluminescent assay kits comprising a conjugate as described herein. Such kits preferably comprise one or more assay components as described above, including at least one chemiluminescent assay component comprising chemiluminescent moiety of the invention, and may optionally include one or more of: instructions for performing the detection; reagents, such as buffers, for use in performing the detection; pipets for liquid transfers; etc.",

The analytical sensitivity of the both the TSH and ACTH assays was significantly improved using the relatively hydrophilic acridinium labeled antibodies at a lower antibody concentration than the relatively hydrophobic acridinium (MeAE) labeled antibody.",
