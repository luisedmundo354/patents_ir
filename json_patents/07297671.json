    "description": [
        "The present invention relates generally to the field of surfactants and methods of making the same. In particularly preferred form, the present invention relates to nonionic surfactants having increased cloud points and to methods of making the same.",
        "The clouding behavior of surfactants in water with increasing temperature has several practical applications. For example, the defoaming action of surfactants becomes effective just above their cloud point. See Otten et al, \u201cAnionic Hydrotropes for Industrial and Institutional Rinse Aids\u201d, JAOCS; 63(8); 1078; 1986 (the entire content of which is incorporated expressly hereinto by reference). An end user will therefore select a particular surfactant for specific problem solving abilities such as wetting, detergency, foaming, defoaming and the like. In cleaning applications such as machine dish washing, the properties noted above are important. Since the water temperature in dish washing applications is relatively high, the surfactant selected often cannot meet all of the desired performance criteria. As a result, additives are typically included with the surfactant to achieve the desired solubilization. However, often times, when all other properties of the surfactant are in agreement for a specific application, often the surfactant's cloud point is too low. While the cloud point can be engineered by altering the surfactant's chemical structure, such structural alteration usually is accompanied by a change in one of its other properties thereby making it no longer useful for the intended application.",
        "Recently, it has been suggested that certain electrolytes may be added so as to adjust the cloud point of a block copolymer surfactant comprised of an ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) units. Pandya et al, \u201cEffect of Additives on the Clouding Behavior of an Ethylene Oxide-Propylene Oxide Block copolymer in Aqueous Solution\u201d; J.M.S-Pure Appl. Chem; A30(1); 1; 1993 (the entire content of which is expressly incorporated hereinto by reference). However, the technique described in this paper involves the addition of foreign materials often adding extra cost and unwanted interferences in the surfactant's performance.",
        "Polyether polyol surfactants are typically prepared by the reaction of monomeric or polymeric initiators containing one or more active hydrogen-containing group(s), such as OH, NH2, NH, CO2H and the like, with alkylene oxides. The alkylene oxide reactions with the active hydrogen-containing compounds are catalyzed with alkaline catalysts such as potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. At the end of the reaction, the catalyst is deactivated by either removing the catalyst physically from the resulting reactant mixture or by adding an acid, such as acetic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and the like, in order to neutralize the catalyst. The most cost-effective way of deactivating the alkaline catalyst is by neutralizing the catalyst with an acid and leaving the resulting salt physically in the polyether polyol reaction product.",
        "It has now been surprisingly discovered that, by neutralizing a surfactant which is the alkaline-catalyzed reaction product between a monomeric or polymeric compound (initiator) having at least one active hydrogen group and an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid, the cloud point of the surfactant may be raised as compared to otherwise identical surfactants which have not been neutralized (i.e., non-neutralized surfactants) and/or otherwise identical surfactants that have been neutralized with conventional non-fatty acids, such as acetic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and the like.",
        "These and other aspects and advantages will become more apparent after careful consideration is given to the following detailed description of the preferred exemplary embodiments thereof.",
        "The preferred surfactants employed in the practice of the present invention include the alkaline-catalyzed reaction products between a monomeric or polymeric initiator having at least one active hydrogen-containing group with an alkylene oxide (e.g., polyether polyols). Especially preferred surfactants include at least one of an alcohol alkoxylates and block copolymers of ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO). The preferred alcohol alkoxylates have the general formula:\n\nR1-(EO)m-(PO)n-OH,\n\nwhere R1 is a C6-C30 alkyl, alkenyl, alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbon, and m and n are each, independent of one another, numbers from 0 to 100, provided that the total of m+n is 2 to 100. The alcohol alkoxylates most preferably include an alcohol chain having from 1 to 25 carbon atoms and most preferably include a linear alkyl alcohol alkoxylates and alkylphenol alkoxylates (e.g., dodecyl alcohol ethoxylates, tridecyl alcohol ethoxylates, nonylphenol ethoxylates, octylphenol ethoxylates and the like). Suitable alcohol alkoxylate surfactants are commercially available from BASF Corporation under the trademarks PLURAFAC\u00ae and ICONOL\u2122.",
        "The preferred block copolymers of EO and PO units will typically have a number average molecular weight of from 500 to 15,000, preferably between 1,000 to 10,000. Suitable block copolymers of EO and PO are commercially available from BASF Corporation under the registered trademark TETRONIC\u00ae.",
        "Virtually any saturated or unsaturated fatty acid may be employed in the practice of this invention. Preferably, the fatty acid will have at least 8 carbon atoms in its chain. Most preferably, C8 up to C24 fatty acids are employed. Specific examples of preferred fatty acids include caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, vaccenic acid, linoleic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid, erucic acid and lignoceric acid. In addition, the fatty acids may be supplied by natural sources such as tall oil, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, animal fats, olive oil, butter fat, corn oil linseed oil, peanut oil fish oil, rapeseed oil and the like.",
        "The fatty acid is employed in amounts sufficient to neutralize the alkaline catalysts (typically potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or the like) employed in the reaction of monomeric or polymeric alcohols containing one or more active hydrogen-containing group(s) with alkylene oxides. By the term \u201cneutralize\u201d is meant that the resulting surfactant following the addition of the fatty acid has a pH of between about 5.5 to about 8.5, more preferably about 7.0+/\u22120.9. The fatty acid is preferably employed in an amount which increases the cloud point temperature of the surfactant by between about 2\u00b0 C. to about 50\u00b0 C., more preferably, between about 5\u00b0 C. to about 35\u00b0 C., as compared to the unneutralized surfactant and/or the surfactant which has been neutralized conventionally (i.e., neutralized with non-fatty acids such as acetic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and the like). It should of course be understood that the cloud point temperature increase achieved by the present invention is dependent upon the particular surfactant that is neutralized with the fatty acid. That is, some surfactants will experience a greater cloud point temperature increase as compared to other surfactants. Most preferably, the fatty acid will be employed in amounts sufficient to neutralize the alkaline catalyst used in the production of the surfactant to a pH range of between about 6.5 to about 8.5.",

        "A \u201ccloud point\u201d is the temperature at which a surfactant solution becomes cloudy. The cloud points were determined on the samples listed in examples S1-S6 as outlined below. The method was applicable to both neutralized product and in-process samples (unneutralized). The process was terminated often by checking the cloud point of the in-process sample (unneutralized) to the set commercial specification of the product neutralized with conventional acids or after removal of the catalyst. The determined cloud points of the unneutralized process samples were the same for the neutralized commercial samples.",
