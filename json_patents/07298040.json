        "This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/121,167, filed Apr. 12, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,930,381.",
        "The present invention relates to packages for integrated circuits. More particularly, the present invention relates to package arrangement to reduce loop inductance.",
        "Presently used to make integrated circuits with printed circuit boards, ball grid arrays (BGA's) packages are leadless, surface-mounted packages in which solder balls interconnects cover the bottom surface of the package in a checkerboard fashion. Typically, a mass reflow process is used to attach BGA's to printed circuit boards (PCB's), a term generally used for printed circuit configurations such as rigid or flexible, single, double, or multilayered boards that are completely processed. Integrated circuit (IC) is the term generally used for a microelectronic semiconductor device consisting of many interconnected transistors and other components. Typically, IC's are fabricated on a small rectangle called a die that is cut from a silicon wafer known as a substrate. Different areas of the substrate are \u201cdoped\u201d with other elements to make them either \u201cp-type\u201d or \u201cn-type.\u201d Polysilicon or aluminum tracks are etched in one to three (or more) layers deposited over the substrate's surface(s). The die is then connected into a package using gold wires, which are welded to \u201cpads,\u201d usually found near the edge of the die.",
        "Ball grid arrays formed on multilayer substrates typically incorporate within the BGA substrate pattern drilled holes in laminate called vias, which connect different layers of circuitry. Typically, at least one via is positioned between two diagonal balls on the substrate, or on the printed circuit board (PCB).",
        "Inductance is the ability of a conductor to produce an induced voltage when cut by a magnetic flux; A conductor is a material capable of conveying an electric current. Virtually all conductors have inductance, but the amount of inductance associated with each conductor varies according to a number of factors such as type of conductive material, shape of the conductor, length of the conductor, and so forth. For example, a shorter wire has less inductance than a long wire because less conductor length cut by a magnetic flux produces less voltage. Similarly, a straight wire has less inductance than a coiled wire because the conductor concentrates more conductor length in a given area of magnetic flux.",
        "Induction (the production of an induced current within a conductor) occurs whenever magnetic flux cuts across a conductor, such as when a wire is moved within a stationary magnetic field, or when a magnetic field fluctuates about a fixed wire. One characteristic of inductors is that the faster the speed at which the flux changes, the more voltage is induced. The flux induces change in current. For example, Alternating current (AC) circuits continually produce an induced voltage because the current is continuously changing. The faster the current changes, the higher the induced voltage, which always opposes the change in voltage. If current increased, the polarity of the induced voltage opposes the increase in current, and vice versa. However, it is not necessary for the current to alternate directions. Inductance affects DC circuits transient responses whenever the value of the DC current changes, such as when a DC circuit is turned on and off. The switch induces a transient which is a change. The transient will settle to a new value according to the response of the network. Digital signaling is a sequence of transients. Further details concerning about inductance and simultaneous switching noise can be found in the book entitled Digital Signal Integrity: Modeling and Simulation with Interconnects and Packages, by Brian Young, published by Prentice Hall PTR.",
        "Mutual inductance typically occurs whenever two conductors are positioned closely together such that a varying fluxes resulting from a change in current in Conductor A cuts across and induces voltage in Conductor B. This induced voltage, in turn, generates a magnetic flux that cuts across and induces a voltage in conductor A. Because a current in one conductor can induce voltage in the adjacent conductor, the conductors are said to have mutual inductance. To offset this appreciable effect, traces, leads, and current return path are usually kept as short as possible.",
        "Each of these inductance discussed above seriously affects, and in some cases limits, the input/output (I/O) processing speeds of integrated circuits. For example, in the case where all the bus outputs of a circuit simultaneously switch the same way, there will be a current surge flowing in the circuit. This current surge generates an appreciable induced voltage in the circuit's conductors. The induced voltage generates a current flowing opposite to the wave of current, reduces the amount of current flowing through the circuit, thereby slowing the settling time current flow. It is clear that faster processing times will result if system inductance can be minimized. Thus it apparent to one with ordinary skill in the art that a better design is needed.",
        "Accordingly, the present invention, in some embodiments, introduces unique methods and apparatuses for designing a package with reduced loop inductance.

        "FIG. 1 illustrates a typical electronic package in the art. The package 100 includes an integrated circuit (IC) chip, also called die 101. The die 101 is attached on a ball grid array (BGA) substrate 102, which is mounted on a circuit board, such as printed circuit board (PCB) 103. Die 101 normally contains a plurality of electrically conductive contacts, called die pads 104 on the top surface of the die 101. BGA substrate 102 includes a plurality of electrically conductive contacts, also known as bond pads 105. Bond pads 105 receive the bond wires 108 attached to the die pads 104. Electrically conductive traces 107 and 109 connect bond pads 105 to components in other areas or other layers, such as by-pass capacitors 116 mounted on the PCB 103. The BGA substrate is mounted on the PCB through a grid array of solder balls, such as solder balls 113 and 111. The components on different layers are connected through a grid of vias, such as vias 110, 112, 114, and 115. In this conventional package, a return path has to be picked up through either through vias 110 and 115, and solder balls 111, or the return path has to be formed through vias 112 and 114, and solder balls 113. Typical distance between the core balls 113 and the bond pads 105 may be approximately 2000 micron, and typical distance between the perimeter balls 111 and the bond pads 105 may be approximately 3000 micron. As a result, the return path is formed through a relatively large loop. These long loops have significant loop inductance.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates an electrical model of a loop inductance. When a signal switches from zero volts to Ve, because of the long loop 200, the looping inductance causes Ve to be switched 202 significantly slower than expected 201. As a result, the looping inductance reduces the switching speed of an IC device.",
        "FIG. 3 illustrates a typical signal paths in a conventional bonding method. As described in FIG. 3, signal paths 303 are wired from die pads 302 of a die 301 and the bond wires 303 are attached to bond pads 304 of a BGA substrate, forming signals S1 to S9, etc. If these signals are transmitted on the same direction, when they switch, the mutual inductance in the package is significant. Typically voltage resulting from the mutual inductance may be illustrated as follows:",

As a result, the voltage resulting from the mutual inductance could be significant, because all mutual inductances are additive and have the same sign as the self inductance. This raises the effective inductance for a given signal, for example, in some cases, by as much as five to ten times.",
        "FIG. 4 illustrates another typical electronic package in the art. FIG. 4 includes a bottom view 401 of BGA substrate 406. As described in FIG. 4, conventional solder balls are placed either directly under and within the die 405 area, called core balls 403, or placed outside of the bond attachment area (e.g., bond wire wedge area), such was area 404, called perimeter balls 402 or the outer balls. The area where the outer balls 402 are placed is called outer ball region. The area 404 between the core balls 403 and the perimeter balls 402 normally is a ball free zone. The area 404 is normally used to attach the bond wires from the die 405 mounted on the device attachment area 421. Connections between the die 405 and the BGA substrate 406 are formed through bond wires 408 attached on the bond pads 412 located in the bond attachment area 404. The return paths have to be formed either using core balls 403 through vias 413, or using perimeter balls 402 through vias 411, to connect with other components on the other side of the PCB 407, such as by pass capacitors 419 and 420.

In one embodiment, the structure includes a plurality of electrically conductive contacts disposed on a surface of the IC device, plurality of electrically conductive contacts being disposed in at least two rows, a plurality of first return paths formed through some of the plurality of electrically conductive contacts, a plurality of signal paths formed through some of the plurality of electrically conductive contacts, and wherein at least one of the plurality of first return paths are placed between every predetermined number of the plurality of the signal paths.",
        "Referring to FIG. 5, the bond wires connect between the die pads 503 of the die 501 and the bond pads 506 of the BGA substrate 502. The bond wires are configured such that signal paths are mixed with return paths. Referring to FIG. 5, signal paths 505 are mixed with return paths 504 and 509. Return paths 504 and 509 may be the same type of return path. Alternatively, return paths 504 and 509 may be different types of return paths. For example, return path 504 may be a Vdd path and return path 509 may be Vss path. Preferably a signal path is placed adjacent to a return path. In one embodiment, every certain signal paths are placed between two return paths. In a preferred embodiment, every three signal paths, such as S1, S2, and S3, are placed between return paths R1 and R2. Since the directions of the signal and return paths are opposite, the voltage induced by the mutual inductance terms, that couple the return paths current, have a sign that cancels with the self inductance term reducing the overall inductive voltage drop. In one embodiment, the electrical conductive contacts, such as die pads 503 and bond pads 506, are disposed in at least two rows. It would appreciated that multiple rows may be disposed.",
        "In addition, according to one embodiment, the signal paths and return paths may be arranged in multiple heights, such that the mutual inductance may be cancelled in both horizontal and vertical direction (e.g., in a three dimensional (3D) pattern). For example, signal path 507, which runs on the top surface of the BGA substrate 502, may cancel the mutual inductance generated by the return path 508, which is laid inside the BGA substrate 502. Further, the signal path 507 may further cancel other mutual inductance induced from other return paths on the top surface of the BGA substrate 502, as well as those embedded inside the BGA substrate 502, similar to the return path 508. As a result, the mutual inductance is cancelled in a 3D pattern.",

Such multiple layers of mixed signal and return paths constitute a 3D mixed signal and return paths structure. Such 3D mixed signal and return paths structure further improves the cancellation of the mutual inductance. In a further embodiment, a power plane and a ground plane may be embedded inside the BGA substrate 502 and the corresponding PCB (not shown) to mix with the signal and return paths.",

For example, bond wires 606 are formed above the bond wires 607. Both bond wires 606 and 607 may include both signal paths and return paths. As a result, the loop inductance may be cancelled in a three dimensional pattern. Furthermore, as discussed above, similar 3D structure may be embedded inside the BGA substrate 602 and the PCB 603, to form another 3D mixed signal and return path structure inside the BGA substrate 602 and the PCB 603. As a result, mutual inductance of the conductors inside the BGA substrate 602 and the PCB 603 may be cancelled in a 3D pattern.

On the other hand, when a signal switches from a high state to a low state, Vss 806 is used as return path. As a result, only one return path (e.g., either Vdd or Vss) is used.

As described in FIG. 10, additional balls 1004 are placed between the core balls 1003 and the perimeter balls 1002, also as known as free ball zone 404, or the bond attachment area of FIG. 4, in a conventional design. Specifically, additional balls 1004 are placed between the perimeter of the device attachment area (e.g., the area 1020 where the die 1006 is disposed), and the outer balls region 1021(e.g., the area where balls 1002 are placed). The additional balls 1004 are placed near the bond pads 1016 receiving the bond wires 1009 from the die 1006. The balls 1004 enable the bond wire connection reaches other components, such as by pass capacitor 1012 on the other side of the PCB 1008. As a result, the connection has much shorter loop and the loop inductance has been greatly reduced. Current flow is illustrated by arrowed lines that form a closed loop. Without the additional balls 1004, a conventional connection must go through the perimeter balls 1002 and their associated bias 1014 and 1015 to connect to other components such as capacitor 1013, which contains much longer loop and loop inductance. In one embodiment, the electrical conductive contacts, such as die pads disposed on the die and bond pads disposed on the BGA substrate, are disposed in at least two rows.

In this embodiment, the signal paths and return paths are construed that there is a return path between every certain number of signal paths. In one embodiment, a return path is placed between every three signal paths. Referring to FIG. 13A, signal paths 1302 are placed between return paths 1301 and 1303. Return paths 1301 and 1303 may be the same type of return paths. Alternatively, return paths 1301 and 1303 may be different type of return paths.

As a result, the signal paths and return paths are formed in very tight loop. Since the directions of the return paths and signal paths are opposite, the loop inductance will be reduced by the mutual inductance between signal and return paths. Thus the loop inductance may be maintained at an acceptable level.",

It would be appreciated that multiple rows are placed in a mixed patter such that no more than one return path is placed adjacent to each other. In one embodiment, the return paths may be the same type of return path. Alternatively, the return paths may include Vdd and Vss return paths. In case of Vdd and Vss return paths, it is preferred to have signal paths are placed between a Vdd return path and a Vss return path. Thus, every certain number of signal paths (e.g., every three signal paths), there is a Vdd return path or a Vss return path in between.

A return path 1511 goes in an opposite direction from bond attachment area 1514 to the die pad area 1513 of the die 1501. The signal path 1512 and the return path 1511 are arranged in adjacent to each other in a horizontal orientation.

It would be further appreciated that these 3D structures are also applied to the multiple layers of signal path and return path, as well as power and ground planes embedded inside the BGA substrate 1502 and PCB 1503 (not shown), to further reduce the loop inductance of the circuitries in those area.",

The bond pads 1907 may be connected to other components on the other side of a PCB (not shown), through balls 1905 and 1906, and vias 1901 and 1902. As a result, shorter loop is used and the loop inductance may be reduced.",
        "In addition, balls in the region between die 1810 and bond wedges 1811 may have different density, such as a depopulated area to allow more vias to be placed. The general rule is to place opposite polarity vias as close together as possible to have a tight loop, which reduces the loop inductance. Further detailed information concerning depopulation of a BGA substrate to allow via placement can be found in the U.S. co-pending application Ser. No. 09/678,542, filed Oct. 2, 2000 and entitled Depopulation of a Ball Grid Array to Allow Via Placement, by William P. Cornelius, et al., which application is hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will be evident that various modifications may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative sense rather than a restrictive sense."
