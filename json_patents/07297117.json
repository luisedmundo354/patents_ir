        "The present application claims the benefit of Italian Application Serial No. IT SV2003A000023, filed on May 22, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.",
        "The invention addresses a method for optimizing ultrasonic transmit and receive pulses, particularly for ultrasound imaging, wherein transmit pulses are generated from ultrasonic pulse contributions of each of a plurality of electroacoustic transducers, which are grouped in an array and are individually triggered by electric excitation signals, the excitation signal being applied to each individual transducer of the array with a predetermined delay with respect to the application of the excitation signal to the other transducers, and a weight being applied to the excitation signal of each transducer for increasing/decreasing the amplitude of the excitation signal and, as a result, the acoustic signal generated by the transducer.",
        "In prior art insonification and ultrasonic pulse generation methods for ultrasonic imaging, each pulse results from ultrasonic pulse contributions of a certain number of electroacoustic transducers which are individually excited to transmit the corresponding acoustic pulse at different times, i.e. with predetermined delays relative to each other, to generate a comprehensive pulse which is focused on a predetermined scan line or band in the direction of the body or object under examination, and at a predetermined penetration depth within said body or object under examination.",
        "In addition to said focusing, the application of amplitude attenuating/increasing weights to the individual acoustic pulse contributions provided by transducers is known, in order to obtain beam patterns, i.e. pulse fronts having a narrow main lobe, having a predominant amplitude as compared with side lobes. This has the purpose of reducing insonification in regions of the body or object under examination that are close to those on which the ultrasonic transmit pulse is focused and of reducing artifacts in images. Essentially, the side lobes generate reflection pulses from the areas adjacent to pulse focusing areas, and thereby contaminate or distort to a certain extent the resulting image by superposition of such pulses upon the reflection pulses deriving from the main lobe and from the ultrasonic pulse focusing area on the body or object under examination.",
        "Nevertheless, in prior art no consideration is given to the problem that such optimization process does not account for the effects on mechanical pressure distribution in the body or object under examination, which is not optimal in itself, and becomes even less homogeneous in the focusing region, as a result of the ultrasonic pulse optimization process as described above.",
        "The mechanical pressure that is exerted in the body or object being examined also has a certain importance, an excessive mechanical pressure potentially causing the structure of the material of the body or object under examination to break. Such effect is particularly undesired in the field of biomedical imaging, the tissues of the body or object under examination being frequently permeated with contrast agents to enhance visibility of non echogenic tissues. These contrast agents are made of microspheres or microbubbles, which have a nonlinear reflection behavior and reflect the acoustic signal at a frequency that is different from that of the incident transmit pulse, thereby allowing to image structures of non echogenic materials or tissues.",
        "Contrast agents are particularly responsive to the mechanical pressure exerted by acoustic insonification pulses and may be destroyed when such mechanical pressure exceeds predetermined limits.",
        "Essentially, when considering the mechanical pressure profile generated along the scan line on which the ultrasonic pulse is focused, at depths different from the focusing depth, the mechanical pressure value is found to change with depth. Since contrast agents may be located along a scan line at different positions as compared with the ultrasonic pulse focusing depth, prior art methods cannot ensure that the ultrasonic pulse has the right mechanical pressure in the area that is permeated with contrast agents, and it is further not easy to predict if such pressure will be lower or higher than the maximum allowed pressure to prevent contrast agent destruction. Also, regarding the beam pattern, prior art methods cannot ensure that the latter will be constant or substantially constant or anyway that it will maintain a good quality as the penetration depth of the ultrasonic pulse within the body or object under examination changes.",
        "Therefore, the invention has the object of providing a method for optimization of transmit and receive ultrasound pulses, particularly for ultrasonic imaging, whereby the transmit ultrasound pulse may be optimized along a scan line or band, on which the pulse is focused, and across a predetermined penetration depth range, which spans or contains the focusing depth, in such a manner as to obviate the drawbacks of prior art methods, thereby providing both mechanical pressure optimization and beam pattern optimization.",
        "The invention fulfils the above objects by providing a method for optimization of transmit and receive ultrasound pulses, particularly useful for ultrasonic imaging.",
        "The optimal desired mechanical pressure profile relative to the penetration depth of the ultrasonic pulse within the body or object being examined is defined as a function of at least the amplitude weighting parameters for the transducers' contributions to the comprehensive pulse, and of the transmission excitation delays for individual transducer pulse contributions in order to focus ultrasonic pulses on a scan line or band and at a certain penetration depth within the body or object under examination.",
        "The ideal beam pattern for ultrasonic pulses relative to the propagation time or penetration depth within the body or object under examination is defined as a function of at least the amplitude weighting parameters for the transducers' contributions to the comprehensive pulse, and of the transmission excitation delays for individual transducer pulse contributions in order to focus ultrasonic pulses on a scan line or band and at a certain penetration depth within the body or object under examination.",
        "An energy function which depends on the difference between the ideal pressure profile and the actual pressure profile and between the ideal beam pattern and the actual beam pattern is defined and the minimum of that energy function is determined.",
        "Weighting parameters and delays which correspond to the minimum of the energy function are determined and used to excite the transducers to generate the comprehensive ultrasonic pulse.",
        "The transducer excitation delays may be chosen to be ultrasonic pulse focusing delays, which are currently used for focusing ultrasonic pulses in ultrasonic imaging apparatus.",
        "An additional variable may be provided for the individual transducers' pulse contributions which form the comprehensive ultrasonic pulse. The transducers of the transducer array, individually or in subgroups, may be excited to transmit pulse contributions having different waveforms. In this case, both the function that describes the pressure profile relative to the penetration depth and the function that describes the beam pattern profile may depend on the waveforms of the individual transducers' contributions.",
        "The method of the invention will be described below with reference to a few experimental embodiments, whose results are shown in the annexed figures, in which:",
        "FIG. 1 is a schematic view of an array of transducers, and the propagation geometry of an ultrasonic pulse which is focused on a scan line in the pulse propagation direction within a body under examination.",

        "FIG. 15 is a chart that shows the comparison between the angular resolution of the receive signal as optimized according to this invention and the receive signal as obtained from prior art.",
        "The optimization goal for forming ultrasonic pulses is a compromise between the achievement of the best beam pattern and the achievement of the best mechanical pressure profile. Although there is not an exact mathematical solution, there certainly exists a best solution, wherein the energy function is minimized. Due to the considerable computational load required by the large number of variables, the optimal solution is obtained by using predictive or optimization algorithms of the stochastic or evolutionary type.",
        "Suitable algorithms for this application are genetic algorithms, e.g., the Tabu search, among others. A particular algorithm that provides effective results, i.e., a relatively fast convergence and solution stability, where slight parameter variations with respect to the best solution generate slight result variations, is the Simulated Annealing algorithm.",

        "Regarding the ranges wherein the propagation depth variable z and the variable x, which is defined along an axis parallel to the transmission surface of the array of electroacoustic transducers may change, the variable z may obviously change in a range of interest which spans the ultrasonic pulse focusing depth, or in a range in which the focusing depth is one of the upper or lower limits or is close to one of said limits.",
        "Conversely, the variable x may be in a range that is equal to or larger than the whole extension of the transducer array along the x axis parallel to the transmit surface of said transducer array, or said range may be smaller than said extension of the transducer array along the x axis and of the same order of magnitude as a scan band corresponding to a few parallel and adjacent scan lines.",
        "It shall be noted that the energy function to be minimized describes an energy also in physical terms, as it represents the surface difference in a velocity range, which strengthens the adequateness of the above energy function.",
        "According to a further improvement, in the calculation of weights and possibly delays and/or waveforms of transducers' contributions, account is taken of the fact that, for instance, the attenuation of the ultrasonic pulse within the body or object under examination does not only depend on the physical characteristics of the signal, but also on the structure of the body which, e.g. in ultrasonic imaging applications may vary from one region to another due to the presence of different biological tissues, having different ultrasonic pulse absorption capacity. Signal attenuation occurs due to the geometry of the propagation condition, to an attenuation caused by tissue absorption, for instance in biomedical imaging and also due to the radiation pattern of each probe element.",
        "As is further detailed in the following description of an embodiment of the method, it was surprisingly found that the results derived from the generation of an ultrasonic pulse having a nearly constant mechanical pressure in the expected propagation depth range and a beam pattern with a narrow, scan-line centered main lobe and low side lobes, far from the main lobe, which pattern is constant with time, i.e. along the ultrasonic pulse propagation axis, are considerable even when using focusing delays like those conventionally in use in ultrasonic transducer arrays, such as ultrasonic probes, by generating transducers' contributions to the ultrasonic pulse which have the same waveform, of the conventional type, and by only using amplitude weights for said array transducers' contributions. Also, ultrasonic pulse attenuation hypotheses may be only limited to geometric attenuation during propagation.",
        "This provides a considerable simplification of the method as well as remarkable mechanical pressure and beam pattern improvements as compared with prior art, while reducing the computational load. In certain special cases, the method may be required to be carried out by contemplating all possible variables, i.e. in its most general and widest form.",
        "For optimization of receive pulses, the principles that were used for transmit pulses also apply. However, for reception, the waveform variable of the transducers' contributions to the ultrasonic pulse is irrelevant, as the receive contributions consist of the transmit contributions reflected by the structure of the material that forms the body or object being examined. The receive focusing delays may be also kept substantially identical to those conventionally in use for receive beam forming.",
        "For reception also, the only variable for optimization consists of the components of the weight vector.",
        "An improvement of the method according to this invention provides a further simplification of the combined transmit and receive optimization.",
        "Such improvement accounts for the fact that, in order to optimize the ultrasonic transmit pulse, mechanical pressure is particularly relevant, as it particularly exerts its action on contrast agents during transmission of the ultrasonic pulse whereas the provision of an ideal beam pattern or a beam pattern as close as possible to the ideal is not critical to image quality because reflection signal contributions from regions of the body under examination close to those along the focusing line or band can be removed or anyway drastically attenuated by acting on the optimization of reflection pulse reception by the electroacoustic transducers of the array. In fact, if receive ultrasound pulses are optimized by defining a weight vector according to the method of receive pulse beam pattern optimization and in the sense of obtaining a receive pulse having a narrow main lobe and far and low-amplitude side lobes, the contributions to the reflected signal due to reflections from regions of the body close to those along which focusing of the ultrasonic pulse from the side lobes of a transmit pulse having an acceptable but not optimal beam pattern are automatically removed or drastically attenuated. In ultrasonic imaging this has an effect on the image, which is not soiled, i.e. is free from artifacts and has a good side resolution. Conversely, pulse mechanical pressure optimization has no relevance because the mechanical pressure of the transmit pulse is certainly higher than that of the corresponding reflection pulse, hence any destruction effect of an excessive mechanical pressure, e.g. on contrast agent microbubbles, would already occur upon transmission of the ultrasonic pulse and during propagation thereof within the body under examination, whereby the reflected acoustic wave range has an insignificant effect or no effect at all.",

        "The figures only show one half of the beam pattern and further conveniently represent a dB standardized beam power pattern relative to the above defined u variable.",
        "It shall be noted that no optimization was effected for the transmit pulse generated according to prior art. FIG. 14 shows the envelope of the transmit pulse.",
        "FIG. 15 further shows the considerable angular resolution improvement that was obtained by the receive pulse optimization according to the method of the present invention as compared with that obtained with the same probe used in the prior art modes.",
        "The above clearly shows that the optimization according to the method of this invention also provides an optimal mechanical pressure of the transmit pulse, i.e. a constant pressure in a predetermined penetration depth range, which allows treatment of contrast agents, and prevents unexpected local peaks at depths different from the focusing depth, which might otherwise cause an at least partial destruction of contrast agent microbubbles and provide a beam pattern that ensures an optimal angular resolution and a reduced production of image artifacts. Even in its simplest form, wherein the transmit pulse is optimized by an appropriate amplitude weight vector for the contributions of the transducers to the comprehensive pulse, only for obtaining an optimal mechanical pressure, and wherein, on reception, the signal is optimized, still by an appropriate amplitude weight vector for the contributions of the transducers to the comprehensive signal only for obtaining an optimal beam pattern, the experimental results show that, as compared with prior art, better pressure profiles are obtained, as well as an effective reduction of artifacts and a better angular resolution.",
        "Therefore, the simplified form of the inventive method allows to improve ultrasonic imaging performances while reducing the computational load required for determining the optimization weights."
