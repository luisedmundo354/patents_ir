No. 09/926,281, filed Dec. 12, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,861,828. The priority of these prior applications is expressly claimed and their disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to various power supply apparatuses used in automobiles, electric vehicles, construction machinery, various public welfare devices (such as video devices, television sets, and audio devices), various industrial devices (such as personal computers, communication devices, and FA control devices), and so on. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a power supply circuit and a large current load control apparatus of switching power supply using GaN-FETs.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Heretofore, power semiconductor devices such as diodes, thyristors, triacs, GTO (Gate Turn Off) thyristors, bipolar transistors, MOS-FETs, and IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors) are used in various power supply apparatuses. In these power semiconductor devices, a main current that flows through the power semiconductor device is controlled by switching control or analog control. These power semiconductor devices are devices serving as nuclei for implementing stabilized power supply apparatuses, such as switching regulators and linear regulators, and inverters for performing conversion to power having an arbitrary frequency and an arbitrary output voltage.",
        "In these power semiconductor devices, there are switching loss caused by superposition of transient voltage and current at the time of switching and conduction loss caused at the time of conduction. These losses are converted mainly to heat. By the way, the conduction loss has such a characteristic as to become small as the on-resistance is decreased. This on-resistance corresponds to composite resistance of the channel resistance, bulk resistance, and so on existing within the semiconductor except contact resistance between electrodes and semiconductor layer interfaces in the power semiconductor device. Heat generated by the power semiconductor device causes a temperature rise of the power semiconductor device itself. Due to this temperature rise, the power semiconductor device operates at high temperature. Due to this high temperature operation, heat generation of the power semiconductor device is promoted. Such positive feedback is caused. As a result, thermal destruction of the power semiconductor device is caused by thermal runaway.",
        "Usually in the power supply apparatus, therefore, the power semiconductor device itself is provided with a radiation mechanism and in addition, with a radiator such as radiation fins for radiating heat generated by the power semiconductor device. Furthermore, a radiation fan is provided in order to improve the radiation effect in some cases. Furthermore, there is provided a fail safe mechanism that senses the temperature of the power semiconductor device and stops operation of the power semiconductor device when the temperature rises to such a value as to cause thermal runaway.",
        "However, the radiator is formed of a good thermal conductive material, such as aluminum, in order to provide the radiator with a function of heat sink as well. This results in a problem that the whole power supply apparatus becomes large in weight and capacity. Especially as for mobile power supply apparatuses for vehicles or portable power supply apparatuses, emergence of power supply apparatuses reduced in size and weight is demanded strongly.",
        "For example, in a conventional power supply apparatus shown in FIG. 16, a radiator 302 having a large weight and a large capacity is needed. The power supply apparatus shown in FIG. 16 is a DC-DC converter power supply apparatus of a vehicle. A MOS-FET using a Si semiconductor material is incorporated in the power supply apparatus as a switching element. The apparatus main body 301 encloses all the elements forming the power supply apparatus. On the top of the apparatus main body 301, a radiator 302 formed of aluminum is provided. On a junction interface between the radiator 302 and the apparatus main body 301, a MOS-FET, which is not illustrated, stick to the radiator 302. Heat generated by the MOS-FET is absorbed by the radiator 302, and radiated by fins disposed on the top of the radiator 302. Because of installation of the radiator 302, the weight and volume of the whole power supply apparatus become excessively large.",
        "Furthermore, the radiator needs to stick to the power semiconductor device in order to favorably transfer the heat from the power semiconductor device. This brings about limitation on design that the radiator needs to be disposed with due regard to the outer periphery of the casing of the power supply apparatus and the radiation path. This results in a problem that the degree of freedom of the power supply apparatus is reduced. In addition, as for devices such as vehicles using the power supply apparatus, design of the whole device must be changed according to the disposition position of the power supply apparatus. Thus, there is also a problem that the design of the whole device is largely affected.",
        "In addition, in designing the radiator, it is necessary to conduct sufficient radiation design with due regard to the ambient environment of the power supply apparatus. In addition, it is necessary to prevent the power semiconductor device, which is a heat source, from affecting other circuit elements having low heat-resisting property. This results in a problem that much time and labor are required for radiation design and arrangement design of other circuit elements included in the power supply apparatus.",
        "Furthermore, a heat protection circuit for preventing thermal runaway of the power supply apparatus is needed. This heat protection circuit monitors the temperature changes of important components, such as the power semiconductor device, included in the power supply apparatus. When the temperature has risen to a predetermined value, the heat protection circuit conducts fail safe control, such as stopping the power supply apparatus and causing shift to a low dissipation mode. This heat protection circuit is a complicated circuit that senses the temperature, output current, and so on and conducts a shift to fail safe control by using a logic processing circuit. Thus, there is a problem that the power supply apparatus must have a heat protection circuit having such a complicated circuit.",
        "Recently as semiconductor devices having high heat-resisting property, high breakdown voltage, high operation rate and low conduction loss, GaN (gallium nitride) FETs (Field Effect Transistors) have been developed.",
        "Heretofore, such power supply circuits have been applied to, for example, automobiles, various public welfare devices (such as video, television and audio devices), and industrial devices (such as personal computers, communication devices, and FA control devices).",
        "The above described power supply circuit includes a transformer. A transistor made of, for example, a power MOS element turns on and off according to a gate signal. As a result, an output voltage is generated on a secondary winding side.",

Therefore, a radiator for cooling the GaN-FET 10 of the power supply apparatus shown in FIG. 1 becomes unnecessary.",
        "FIG. 3 is a diagram showing differences in structure between the power supply apparatus using the FET of the Si semiconductor and the power supply apparatus using the GaN-FET 10. FIG. 3(a) is a sectional of a power supply apparatus corresponding to the conventional power supply apparatus shown in FIG. 10. In FIG. 3(a), a FET 20 of a Si semiconductor is used. The FET 20 generates much heat. Accordingly, a radiator 22 made of aluminum having high conductivity is provided on the top of an apparatus main body 21. One end surface of the radiator 22 is opposed to the apparatus main body 21, and it serves as a lid of the apparatus main body 21. On the other end surface of the radiator 22, radiation fins are provided to radiate heat generated by the FET 20 to the environment. Most of the heat generated by the conventional power supply apparatus is occupied by heat generated by the FET 20. Therefore, the FET 20 is joined to the one end surface of the radiator 22 so as to make the contact area large.",
        "On the other hand, FIG. 3(b) is a sectional view of the power supply apparatus using the GaN-FET 10. The power supply apparatus shown in FIG. 3(b) differs from the power supply apparatus shown in FIG. 3(a) in that the radiator 22 is not provided. As described above this is because the power supply apparatus shown in FIG. 3(b) uses the GaN-FET 10, which generates less heat. In the power supply apparatus using the GaN-FET 10, therefore, the radiator 22, which is large in weight and volume, can be eliminated. As a result, reduction of the size and weight of the power supply apparatus can be realized, and it becomes unnecessary to conduct the radiation design calculation for design of the radiator 22.",
        "Furthermore, since the GaN-FET 10 itself does not generate heat, the GaN-FET 10 can be disposed in an arbitrary position of the apparatus main body 23. Therefore, arrangement of components included in the power supply apparatus, i.e., layout design can be conduct flexibly.",
        "Furthermore, since heat generation of the GaN-FET 10 need not be considered, the radiation design of the whole power supply apparatus is facilitated. In addition, since the layout design can be conducted flexibly, it becomes possible to integrate the layout of components included in the power supply apparatus as shown in FIG. 3(c). As a result, it becomes possible to obtain a power supply apparatus 24 contracted as compared with the power supply apparatus main body 23. Accordingly, further reduction of the size and weight of the power supply apparatus is realized. Furthermore, because of reduced size and weight of the power supply apparatus and less heat generated by the power supply apparatus, this power supply apparatus can be disposed in an arbitrary position of a device such as a vehicle using the power supply apparatus.",
        "The reason why the size of the GaN-FET 10 shown in FIGS. 3(b) and (c) is reduced as compared with the size of the FET 20 shown in FIG. 3(a) is that the amount of heat generated by the GaN-FET 10 is small and consequently the radiation structure of the GaN-FET 10 itself becomes unnecessary and the size and weight of the GaN-FET 10 itself become small.",
        "The power supply apparatus shown in FIG. 1 is an example of the simplest linear regulator. In addition, a circuit for stabilizing the output voltage Vout under the load variation may be provided. For example, the voltage Vz of the Zener diode ZD may be adjusted by using resistors connected in series across the output voltage Vout, thereby conducting voltage division, using semifixed resistors as respective resistors, and adjusting the semifixed resistors finely.",
        "Furthermore, there may be provided a protection circuit that uses a differential amplifier for comparing a voltage divided by resistors connected in series with a reference voltage and thereby conducts protection against overcurrent and load shortcircuit. Since the temperature of the GaN-FET 10 itself is hardly raised even by an overcurrent, however, the thermal protection circuit may be simplified or eliminated. In this case, other components can be prevented from being destroyed by providing a fuse or the like on the input voltage Vin side. As a result, in the power supply apparatus using the GaN-FET 10, the thermal protection circuit can be simplified or eliminated. Therefore, reduction in size and weight of the power supply apparatus is further promoted, and the time and labor required for the design of the power supply apparatus can be reduced.",
        "According to the first embodiment, the GaN-FET 10 having a low on-resistance is used, and consequently the radiator 22 of the power supply apparatus is not needed, and the GaN-FET 10 can be disposed in an arbitrary position in the power supply apparatus. Therefore, the power supply apparatus can be remarkably reduced in size and weight. Furthermore, the time and labor required for the radiation design including the radiator and the design of the thermal protection circuit can be reduced. In addition, the time and labor required for the radiation design including the radiator and the design of thermal protection circuit can be reduced, and the GaN-FET 10 can be disposed in an arbitrary position in the power supply apparatus, therefore the time and labor required for the layout design of the whole power supply apparatus can also be reduced. In addition, since the amount of heat generated by the GaN-FET 10 itself is small and the GaN-FET 10 has a heat-resisting property of 500\u00b0 C. or more, it becomes possible to use the power supply apparatus for a long time and the maintenance required for the power supply apparatus is also reduced.",

        "FIG. 4 is a diagram showing a schematic circuit configuration of a power supply apparatus that is an embodiment of the present invention. In the power supply apparatus shown in FIG. 4, a GaN-FET 30 having the same configuration as that of the GaN-FET 10 is connected in parallel with the GaN-FET 10. The parallel connection of the GaN-FET 10 and the GaN-FET 30 unit connecting sources S, drains D and gates G of each of the GaN-FET 10 and together. Remaining configuration is the same as that of the power supply apparatus shown in FIG. 1. The same components are denoted by like characters.",
        "As described above, each of the GaN-FETs 10 and 30 themselves has an extremely small on-resistance. Therefore, the conduction loss is low and the amount of generated heat is small. Therefore, adjacent arrangement of a plurality of GaN-FETs becomes possible. Parallel connection of GaN-FETs that does not cause a large weight change and a large volume change as compared with the case of the GaN-FET 10 alone becomes possible. As a result, the maximum current value of the power supply apparatus can be doubled. In other words, each of the GaN-FETs 10 and 30 shown in FIG. 4 can flow a maximum current of 10 A. By connecting them in parallel, however, a maximum current of 20 A can be flown. As a result, the current supply capability of the whole power supply apparatus can be doubled.",

FIG. 5(b) is a sectional view of the power supply apparatus having the GaN-FETs 10 and 30 connected in parallel and arranged so as to be adjacent to each other. In the case where a power supply apparatus that flows a current of 20 A in the same way as the GaN-FETs 10 and 30 connected in parallel is implemented by using the FET 20 of the Si semiconductor, the amount of heat generated by the FET 20 becomes further large. Therefore, the radiator 22 shown in FIG. 5(a) must be made further larger.",
        "On the other hand, although the apparatus shown in FIG. 5(b) has a capability that is twice the amount of power supplied by the power supply apparatus shown in FIG. 5(a), the radiator 22 is not needed and consequently remarkable reduction in size and weight is realized. Furthermore, since the GaN-FETs 10 and 30 can be arranged so as to be adjacent to each other, design of the power supply apparatus is also facilitated.",
        "In FIG. 5(c), a power supply apparatus further reduced in size and weight is implemented by conducting the layout design of respective components included in the power supply apparatus in the same way as FIG. 3(c).",
        "By the way, the configuration having two GaN-FETs 10 and 30 connected in parallel is shown In FIG. 4. However, the configuration is not limited thereto, but a configuration having three or more GaN-FETs are connected in parallel may be used. In this case, the current supply capability can be further improved.",
        "In addition to the operation effects of the first embodiment, according to the second embodiment, the power supply capability of the power supply apparatus itself can be doubled with the same weight, volume, and scale as those when one GaN-FET is used by only connecting the GaN-FETs 10 and 30 in parallel. Furthermore, in view of the current situation that the development of a GaN-FET capable of flowing a large current therethrough is under progress, the parallel connection of GaN-FETs becomes effective unit which easily realizes the reduction of size and weight in large-power supply apparatuses.",

In this switching regulator, a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal output by a pulse width control circuit 41 is applied to a GaN-FET 40 at its gate, and the GaN-FET 40 is switched. When the GaN-FET 40 is on, energy of an input voltage Vin stored across an electrolytic capacitor C41 is transferred to an electrolytic capacitor C42 via a transformer T1, a diode D1 and an inductor L1. When the GaN-FET 40 is off, energy left in the inductor L1 is transferred to the electrolytic capacitor C42 via a diode D2. The electrolytic capacitor C42 outputs it as an output voltage Vout.",

The pulse width control circuit 41 applies a PWM signal corresponding to the control value input from the photocoupler PC to the GaN-FET 40 at its gate, controls the current value of the GaN-FET 40, and thereby conducts power control of the output voltage Vout side (secondary side).",
        "In this switching regulator, GaN-FET 40 is used as a switching element of a primary side. In the same way as the GaN-FET 10 and 30 in the first and second embodiments, however, the GaN-FET 40 is smaller in on-resistance than the conventional FET of the Si semiconductor. Therefore, the amount of heat generated by the GaN-FET 40 itself is little and the radiator for radiation becomes unnecessary.",
        "Furthermore, since the heat generated by the GaN-FET 40 itself is little and the radiator is unnecessary, the GaN-FET 40 can be disposed arbitrarily in the switching regulator. As a result, reduction of the size and weight of the switching regulator can be realized, and in addition the time and labor required for the design including the radiation design can be reduced.",

Since this current Is charges the electrolytic capacitor C2 through the coil L1, E0 is output as an output voltage. At the same time, energy is stored within the coil L1 by the current flown through the coil L1.",
        "If the GaN-FET 200 passes through an ON period and turns off, then transmission of power from the primary winding side through the transformer T1 disappears, and a voltage of an opposite polarity is generated in the coil L1. It is counter electromotive force caused by the energy stored in the coil L1 until then.

In addition, it is also possible to use a large current load control apparatus according to the present invention for motor control, for example on/off control of a load, such as a floor motor or wiper motor (HI, LOW, INT, MIST) for automobiles.",
        "As heretofore described, according to a power supply apparatus according to the present invention, a semiconductor element formed by using a GaN compound is disposed in the path of a main current that is a subject of power control, and control unit controls conduction of the main current flowing through the semiconductor element. Since the semiconductor element is small in resistance at the time of conduction, little heat is generated and it becomes unnecessary to provide the power supply apparatus with a radiator having a large weight and a large volume. This brings about an effect that reduction of the power supply apparatus in size and weight can be realized and the time and labor required for radiation design can be remarkably reduced. Furthermore, it becomes unnecessary to make the semiconductor element stick to a radiator. The semiconductor element can be disposed in an arbitrary position in the power supply apparatus. This brings about an effect that the degree of freedom in the design of the power supply apparatus is increased in addition to easiness of the radiation design, eventually making possible integration of elements arranged in the power supply apparatus, and reduction of the power supply apparatus in size and weight is further promoted. In addition, there is brought about an effect that the thermal runaway is eliminated and consequently a thermal protection circuit such as an overcurrent protection circuit can be simplified.",
        "Furthermore, according to a power supply apparatus according to the present invention, a semiconductor element formed by using a GaN compound disposed in the path of a main current that is a subject of power control, and control unit conducts switching control on conduction of the main current flowing through the semiconductor element.

        "Furthermore, according to a power supply apparatus according to the present invention, the power supply apparatus includes a plurality of the semiconductor elements disposed in the path of a main current that is a subject of power control, and the plurality of semiconductor elements are connected in parallel. The limit of the main current that can be controlled is remarkably improved. In addition, the semiconductor elements generate little heat. This brings about an effect that a power supply apparatus having high power control capability can be implemented by using a power supply apparatus having nearly the same weight and volume as those of a power supply apparatus equipped with one semiconductor element.",
        "Furthermore, according to a power supply apparatus according to the present invention, the power supply apparatus includes a plurality of semiconductor elements disposed in the path of a main current that is a subject of power control, and when connecting the semiconductor elements in parallel, the semiconductor elements in the power supply apparatus are arranged so as to be adjacent to each other, because the semiconductor elements themselves generate little heat. This brings about an effect that the degree of freedom of design can be further improved.",
        "Furthermore, according to a power supply apparatus according to the present invention, the semiconductor element disposed in the path of a main current that is a subject of power control is formed of a GaN-FET, and the resistance at the time of conduction is made extremely small. Thus, heat generated by the semiconductor element is made little. This brings about an effect that reduction of the power supply apparatus in size and weight is further promoted and the time and labor required for design including the radiation design can be remarkably decreased.",
        "Furthermore, according to a power supply circuit according to the present invention, a GaN-FET, which is small in generated heat, is used as a switching element of the power supply circuit. This brings about an effect that reduced heat generation of the switching element makes the radiation plate unnecessary and the power supply circuit can be reduced in size and weight.",
        "Furthermore, according to a large current load control apparatus according to the present invention, a GaN-FET, which is small in generated heat and which can operate at high temperature (at least 500\u00b0 C.), is used as an on/off control switching element of the large current load control apparatus. This brings about an effect that reduced heat generation of the switching element makes the radiation plate unnecessary and the power supply circuit can be reduced in size and weight.",
        "The diodes in the circuits as shown in figures may be made from GaN compound semiconductor. A diode made from a GaN compound semiconductor (hereinafter, \u201cGaN-diode\u201d) has an on-resistance per unit area and a conduction loss which are smaller than those of a Si semiconductor diode, like the GaN-FET. The GaN-diode is more stable under high temperatures than that of a Si semiconductor diode. Therefore, it is effective to use the GaN-diode to bring advantages of the GaN-FET with a low conduction loss and high temperature operation. In paticulat, it is preferable to use the GaN-diodes in place of the diodes disposed in the path of a main current. Such replaceable diodes are for example the diodes D1 and D2 in FIG. 6, the diode D3 in FIG. 7, the diodes used in the secondary winding side of the switching regulator circuit in FIG. 8, the diodes used in the rectifier circuit of the power supply apparatus, and the diodes D1 and D2 in FIG. 10.",
        "These diodes may be arranged in parallel. In the circuit of the power supply apparatus shown in FIG. 6, the diodes D1 and D2 may be arranged as shown in FIG. 17, for example. The GaN-diodes allow adjacent arrangement because of their low heating value, and thus parallel connection thereof. As a result, the maximum current value of the power supply apparatus can be doubled.",
        "A circuit with an FET, in general, includes a protection diode for the FET. A protection diode for a GaN-FET is preferably a GaN-diode. Such a GaN-diode used as a protection diode may be connected to a GaN-FET as shown in FIG. 18. This GaN-diode is arranged in parallel with the GaN-FET, and serves as a flywheel diode. In an inductor circuit including a winding, an alternating voltage applied to the inductor circuit, for example at power on/off, generates a back electromotive force. The flywheel diode is used to protect the GaN-FET from the back electromotive force.",
        "FIG. 19 shows one example of the GaN-diode as described above. A GaN-diode shown in FIG. 19 includes an insulating or semi-insulating substrate 101, a buffer layer 102 formed on the substrate 101, and a III-V nitride semiconductor layer (GaN layer) 103 formed on the buffer layer 102. This GaN-diode also includes a first anode electrode 108 having a width d (preferably, of 0.3 to 2 \u03bcm, for example 2 \u03bcm) and forming a Schottky junction with the semiconductor layer 103, and a second anode electrode 109 forming a Schottky junction with the semiconductor layer 103 so as to cover and be electrically connected to the first anode electrode 108. The first anode electrode 108 and the second anode electrode 109 constitute a composite anode electrode 110.",
        "In this GaN-diode, the Schottky barrier between the first anode electrode 108 and the semiconductor layer 103 is lower than the Schottky barrier between the second anode electrode 109 and the semiconductor layer 103.",
        "The first anode electrode 108 with the lower Schottky barrier acts prior to the second anode electrode 109 immediately after a voltage is applied to the anode electrode 110 in the forward direction. The second anode electrode 109 acts after the forward voltage increases up to a predetermined level. Thus, the rising of the forward current becomes quick, so that the on-resistance becomes zero and the on-voltage becomes approximately zero. When a voltage is applied to the anode electrode 110 in the reverse direction, a depletion layer widens in semiconductor layer right under the second anode electrode 109, so that the current path is pinched off, stopping the current flow. In other words, the GaN-diode provides the diode characteristic.",
        "In the GaN-diode according to the embodiment, the III-V nitride semiconductor layer 103 has a heterostructure 106 that includes a pair of a low bandgap layer 104 and a high bandgap layer 105. The heterostructure 106 exhibits the piezoelectric effect at the interface between the layers 104 and 105 with different bandgap. This piezoelectric effect causes a two-dimensional electron gas layer 107 in the low bandgap layer 104 near the interface.",
        "When the anode electrode 110 is forward biased, a current flows through the anode electrode 110, the high bandgap layer 105, and the two-dimensional electron gas layer 107 in the low bandgap layer 104, in order.",
        "Since the two-dimensional electron gas layer 107 has a high electron mobility, a resistance to the flow of the current in this layer is very low. Therefore, the on-resistance becomes more lower by the two-dimensional electron gas layer 107 in the path of a current flowing from a cathode electrode 112.",
        "The cathode electrode 112 of the GaN-diode forms an ohmic contact with a contact layer 111. The contact layer 111 is in contact with the low bandgap layer 104, and thus the two-dimensional electron gas layer 107 is electrically connected to the contact layer 111.",
        "FIG. 20 shows another example of the GaN-diode. A GaN Schottky diode 100 shown in FIG. 20 includes an insulating or semi-insulating sapphire substrate 113, a GaN buffer layer 114 having a thickness of 50 nm and formed on the substrate 113, and n+-GaN layer 116 having a thickness of 2000 nm and formed on the buffer layer 114. An n-GaN layer 118 is formed on the n+-GaN layer 116. The n-GaN layer 118 includes a plane portion 118a having a thickness of 500 nm and a convex portion 118b protruded from the central of the surface of the plane portion 118a. The convex portion 118b has a width of 2000 nm and a height of 2000 nm. The impurity concentration of the n-GaN layer 118 is as low as preferably not more than 2\u00d71017 cm\u22123 (for example, approximately 2\u00d71017 cm\u22123). This is because although a reverse bias to the GaN Schottky diode 100 widens a depletion layer in the n-GaN layer 118, an excessive impurity concentration does not widen the depletion layer, thereby causing no pinch off state, as described later.",
        "The GaN Schottky diode 100 also includes an undoped Al0.2Ga0.8N layer 122, a Ti (titanium) electrode 126, and a Pt (platinum) electrode 128. The Al0.2Ga0.8N layer 122 has a thickness of 30 nm and a bandgap higher than that of the n-GaN layer 118, and covers the surface of the plane portion 118a and the side of the convex portion 118b. The Ti electrode 126 forms a Schottky junction on the top of the convex portion 118b, and serves as a first anode electrode. The Pt electrode 128 is formed on the Ti electrode 126 and the Al0.2Ga0.8N layer 122, and serves as a second anode electrode. The Pt electrode 128, concretely, is electrically connected to the Ti electrode 126, and forms a Schottky junction via the Al0.2Ga0.8N layer 122 to connect with the side of the convex portion 118b. The Ti electrode 126 and the Pt electrode 128 constitute a composite anode electrode 130.",
        "An SiO2 film 132 covers the sides of the Pt electrode 128, the Al0.2Ga0.8N layer 122, and the plane portion 118a and a part of the surface of the n+-GaN layer 116. A cathode electrode 134 is made from a TaSi layer, and forms an ohmic contact with the n+-GaN layer 116 (outer of the part of the surface).",
        "A heterojunction is formed between the n-GaN layer 118 and the Al0.2Ga0.8N layer 122. A two-dimensional electron gas layer occurs near the interface of the heterojunction as indicated by a dashed line in FIG. 20. A Schottky barrier with a height of 0.3 eV is formed at a contact surface between the Ti electrode 126 and the n-GaN layer 118. According to this embodiment, the Schottky junction is not formed at the interface between the Pt electrode 128 and the n-GaN layer 118. If the Schottky junction is formed at the interface, a Schottky barrier with a height of 1.0 eV is formed at the interface.",
        "The first anode electrode may be made of metal which forms a Schottky barrier with a height lower than the n-GaN layer 118 by less than 0.8 eV, such as W (tungsten) and Ag (silver), instead of Ti. The second anode electrode may be made of metal which forms a Schottky barrier with a height higher than the n-GaN layer 118 by more than 0.8 eV, such as Ni (nickel), Pd (palladium), and Au (gold), instead of Pt.",
        "The first anode electrode and the second electrode with a Schottky barrier higher than that of the first anode electrode to a GaN semiconductor layer makes the diode with a low on-resistance and a low reverse current leakage.",

In addition, there is brought about effects that reduction of the power supply apparatus in size and weight is further promoted, and the time and labor required for radiation design can be remarkably reduced.",
        "As heretofore described, the power supply apparatus, the power supply circuit, and the large current load control apparatus are useful for automobiles, electric vehicles, construction machinery, various public welfare devices (such as video devices, television sets, and audio devices), various industrial devices (such as personal computers, communication devices, and FA control devices), and so on.
