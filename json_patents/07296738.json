        "(1) Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a point-of-sale terminal (POS terminal) for inputting a quantity for commodities involved in a transaction and inputting commodity information on the commodities, a method of correcting the quantity, and a computer-readable storage medium with a program for causing a computer to correct the quantity.",
        "(2) Description of the Related Art",
        "In the POS terminal of a POS system for registration of transaction information on commodities, when selling a plurality of identical commodities in a transaction, the quantity of commodities is typically registered by two registration methods, a pre-declaration method and an after-declaration method.",
        "In the pre-declaration method, commodity registration is performed after the declaration of a quantity. More specifically, the quantity of commodities is first declared by inputting the quantity with a numeric key, etc., provided in the POS terminal. Then, commodity registration is performed by inputting information on the commodities (an identification number, etc.) with a bar-code reader, etc. For example, when registering (or selling) two identical commodities, a numeric key \u201c2\u201d is depressed and then a Multiplication (\u00d7) key is depressed. This means that the depressed numeric key is a multiplier. Next, the commodity is scanned with a bar-code reader.",
        "In the after-declaration method, the declaration of a quantity is performed after commodity registration. For instance, when registering two identical commodities, scanning is performed with a bar-code reader, and then the numeric key \u201c2\u201d and Multiplication (\u00d7) key are depressed.",
        "In the above-described POS system, there is a possibility that an operator will register an incorrect quantity. Because of this, in conventional POS systems, an incorrect quantity registered can be corrected by methods disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. HEI 3-276390, HEI 8-83382, and SHO 57-97165.",
        "For instance, in the after-declaration method, when an operator inputs an incorrect quantity, the quantity can be corrected by inputting only a correct quantity with a numeric key and a Multiplication (\u00d7) key immediately after the incorrect input. Until the time the next commodity is scanned with a bar-code reader, an incorrect quantity can be easily corrected by inputting a correct quantity with a numeric key and a Multiplication (\u00d7) key immediately after the input of the incorrect quantity.",
        "However, in the pre-declaration method, the input of a quantity through a numeric key, which is performed after scanning is performed by a bar-code reader, is handled as the declaration of a quantity for the next item. Therefore, after an item registered by an incorrect quantity is deleted, it is necessary to perform quantity declaration and commodity registration again.",
        "That is, when correcting an incorrect quantity registered by the pre-declaration method, the operator has to perform four steps, (1) selection of an item to be corrected, (2) deletion of the item, (3) quantity declaration (e.g., depression of a numeric key \u201c2\u201d and a Multiplication (\u00d7) key), and (4) commodity registration (re-registration). These four steps is a troublesome and time-consuming operation. In addition, there is a possibility that when performing commodity registration, other commodities will be registered by mistake.",
        "In the pre-declaration method and after-declaration method, when correcting a quantity for an item registered two or more before, that item is deleted and then it is necessary to perform quantity declaration and commodity registration again. As described above, it is necessary to perform four steps, (1) selection of an item to be corrected, (2) deletion of the item, (3) quantity declaration (e.g., depression of a numeric key \u201c2\u201d and a Multiplication (\u00d7) key), and (4) commodity registration.",
        "The present invention has been made in view of the circumstances described above. Accordingly, it is the primary object of the present invention to provide a POS terminal, a quantity correction method, and a computer-readable medium with a quantity correction program, which are capable of correcting a quantity easily and preventing commodity misregistration from taking place during the correction.",
        "To achieve this end, there is provided a first point-of-sale terminal including a commodity information input part for inputting commodity information on commodities involved in a transaction; a quantity input part for inputting a quantity for the commodities; a storage part for storing the quantity and the commodity information, as item information; a calculation part for calculating an amount of money involved in the transaction in dependence on the item information stored in the storage part; the point-of-sale terminal comprising a quantity correction indication part for indicating correction of the quantity; and a quantity correction part for correcting the quantity, when the correction is indicated by the correction indication part, by replacing the quantity in the item information last stored in the storage part with another quantity newly input by the quantity input part; the calculation part recalculating the amount of money based on the new quantity.",

        "In the POS terminal 10, the input of the quantity of sold commodities (a quantity for an item) by the keyboard 12 is performed by selecting a numeric key \u201cn\u201d (where n is a natural number) indicative of a quantity and then depressing the Multiplication (\u00d7) key 122 indicating that a plurality of commodities were sold.",
        "The Quantity Correction key 121 of the keyboard 12 is employed when an operator corrects a quantity (total-number). If the operator depresses the Quantity Correction key, the quantity correction part 14 corrects a quantity, as described in detail later. Note that the Quantity Correction key of the keyboard 12 will hereinafter be represented as the Quantity Correction key 121 (which corresponds to a quantity correction indication part).",
        "In the POS terminal 10, when registering or selling commodities, the input of the quantity by the keyboard 12 is performed only when a plurality of identical commodities are registered at a time. In the case where a quantity is 1, it is not necessary to depress the numeric key \u201c1\u201d and Multiplication (\u00d7) key of the keyboard 2. When one commodity is registered through the bar-code reader 11 without using the keyboard 12, a quantity \u201c1\u201d is automatically set as the initial value. In addition, information on a quantity input through the keyboard 12 is delivered to the registration part 22.",
        "In the POS system 10, when selling a plurality of identical commodities, they may be registered by either the pre-declaration method (which performs commodity registration after the declaration of a quantity) or the after-declaration method (which performs the declaration of a quantity after commodity registration). By previously selecting one of the two methods, the input manipulation can be performed with the selected method.",
        "In the preferred embodiment, a description will hereinafter be given in the case where a quantity and commodities are registered by the pre-declaration method. That is, in the POS system 10, by inputting a quantity through the keyboard 12 and then performing commodity registration with the bar-code reader 11, information on an item (item information) is registered.",
        "More specifically, when registering a plurality of identical commodities in one transaction, a numeric key \u201cn\u201d indicative of a quantity is first selected in the keyboard 12. Then, the Multiplication (\u00d7) key 122 is depressed. Thereafter, commodity registration is performed by the bar-code reader 11.",
        "Note that the keyboard 12 may be replaced with a multi-item keyboard with a display for presenting an item name, a quantity, a total price, and a message to an operator (see FIGS. 11A to 11C).",
        "In dependence on the commodity information scanned by the bar-code reader 11, the registration part 22 acquires item information on that commodity and registers it as item list information in the item information list memory part 13. More specifically, the registration part 22 acquires item information (an item name, a unit price, etc.) by referring to the item master 32 of the POS server 30 in dependence on the commodity code (commodity information) scanned by the bar-code reader 11. In addition, when a quantity is input through the keyboard 12 before a commodity code is scanned by the bar-code reader 11, the registration part 22 registers the input number in the item information list memory part 13. On the other hand, when no quantity is input through the keyboard 12, the registration part 22 registers 1 in the item information list memory part 13. At this time, the input number or 1 is registered as item list information so that it is correlated with the above-described item name and unit price.",
        "The registration part 22 further sets different item numbers to item information registered in one transaction. With these different item numbers, specific item information can be selected in one transaction. That is, for example, if an item number is input through the keyboard 12, the item information specified by the item number can be selected from the item information stored in the item information list memory part 13. Thus, the keyboard 12 also functions as an item selection part.",
        "The item information list memory part 13 stores commodity information and a quantity, input through the bar-code reader 11 and keyboard 12, as item information. This item information list memory part 13 is constructed of a memory device such as a random access memory, etc.",
        "The item information list memory part 13 generates and stores an item information list, in which a quantity is correlated with commodity information (a commodity code, an item name, a unit price, etc.) for all commodities registered in one transaction. In the item information list memory part 13, many pieces of item information on all commodities registered in at least one transaction are stored in a time-series as an item information list. Note that there are cases where item information registered in that item information list will hereinafter be referred to as item list information.",
