    "description": [
        "The present invention is directed to the field of conveyors, specifically belt conveyors. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a magnetic support roller for use in centering reinforced conveyor belts.",
        "Preventing conveyor belts from \u201cwalking off\u201d the drive and return drums and the intervening support rollers can be problematic. This can be particularly difficult for conveyor systems which are not prone to being centered by conventional means and which are routinely reversed. These centering problems are exacerbated for conveyor systems having short runs, i.e., where the drive roll and return roll are located close together. Having the loaded belt run high on the support rollers can not only potentially damage the belt but risk spillage of the conveyed load, as well. This difficulty can manifest itself when a lengthy conveyor belt is under load, or when running empty; in the latter case, particularly on the return run. Attempts have been made to remedy this problem by contacting the edges of the belt with stationary guide rails or rotating rollers. In either case, contacting the edge of the belt with something, whether stationary or in motion, can abrade the belt causing wear damage.",
        "Reinforced conveyor belts have steel cord in at least one lateral portion and, in most cases, both sides of the belt. These steel cords are susceptible to magnetic forces if the strength of the magnetic field is sufficient. The advent of rare-earth magnets provides an opportunity to provide a return roller with adequate magnetic field strength to influence the positioning of the belt so as to prevent this \u201cwalking off\u201d problem. In some applications, conventional magnets have adequate force to accomplish the task. Further, in many cases, it is not necessary that each support or return roller have the magnet therein. Often, only every 3rd or 4th roller needs to be magnetized in order to provide a system for maintaining the belt centered on the rollers.",
        "Various other features, advantages, and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent after a reading of the following detailed description.",
        "The preferred embodiment(s) of the present invention is/are described in conjunction with the associated drawings in which like features are indicated with like reference numerals and in which",
        "FIG. 1 is a perspective front view of a first embodiment of the of the present invention;",
        "FIG. 2 is a front view of the first embodiment with one of the rollers in section;",
        "FIG. 3 is a detailed front view of one of the rollers of the first embodiment shown in partial section; and,",
        "FIG. 4 is a front view of a return roller depicted beneath a load-bearing belt employing the features of the present invention.",
        "A first embodiment of the support roller assembly of the present invention is depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2 generally at 20. Support roller assembly 20 has a first roller 22 and a second identical roller 42 which underlie first edge 13 and second edge 15, respectively, of conveyor belt 11. Typically, conveyor belt 11 is reinforced along each edge by means having some capacity for being influenced by a magnetic field. Within the context of this specification, the phrase having magnetic properties will refer to this capacity to be magnetically influenced. In most cases, the reinforcement means comprises one or more steel cables 17 (three being shown) embedded in each edge 13, 15 of the elastomeric body of belt 11.",
        "The details of roller 22 (and identical roller 42) are best seen in FIGS. 2 and 3. Roller 22 comprises a cylindrical sleeve 24 which forms a shell that houses at least one permanent magnet 30. While conventional magnets will be acceptable for some applications, it is preferred that the permanent magnets be rare earth magnets because of their superior magnetic strength. As depicted in FIGS. 2 and 3, permanent magnet 30 comprises two stacks of rare earth magnetic plates 32, 34 which sandwich, and are adhesively bonded to, inner pole disk 33. Outer pole disks 35, 36 are also adhesively bonded to an exterior portion of plate stacks 32, 34, respectively, and held in place by end flanges 38. Preferably, both sleeve 22 and end flanges 38 are made of non-magnetic materials. End flanges 38 are mounted on bearings 39 which rotate on shaft 50. A total of six (two shown) bolts 40 extend through the ordered array defined by the rare earth magnetic plates 32, 34, the pole disks 33, 35, 36 and end flanges 38 and are secured by hex nuts 41. Both the heads of bolts 40 and the hex nuts 41 are countersunk into their respective end flanges 38. Sleeve 24 is secured to end flanges 38 by a plurality of screws 51. Ends of shaft 50 are mounted on L-brackets 52 which are bolted in place atop the beam 19 (FIG. 1).",
        "The principles of the invention can also be applied to the return run 11\u2032 of conveyor belt 11 as seen in FIG. 4. Typically, the support beam 19\u2032 will be flat on the return run. First and second magnetic rollers 22\u2032 help maintain return run 11\u2032 centered and avoid wandering of the conveyor belt. By employing magnets 30 in roller 22, the reinforced conveyor belt 11 is maintained centered for optimum belt wear and load safety. Most preferably, the magnets 30 are of the rare earth variety to provide superior magnetic strength properties. As noted earlier, in certain instances as few as one in three or one in four rollers on the load carrying and return runs need be equipped with magnets to achieve the desired centering of the belt 11. It will be understood that for those belts not having steel cable reinforcement, a \u201creinforcement\u201d strip of ferrous material can be added externally or internally, to one or both edges of the conveyor belt to enable application of the teachings of this invention.",
        "Various changes, alternatives, and modifications will become apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art after a reading of the foregoing specification. It is intended that all such changes, alternatives, and modifications as fall within the scope of the appended claims be considered part of the present invention."
