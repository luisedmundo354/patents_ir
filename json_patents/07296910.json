        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention generally relates to light fixtures for illuminating architectural spaces. The invention has particular application in light fixtures using fluorescent lamps, such as the T5 linear fluorescent lamp, as the light source.",
        "2. Background Art",
        "Numerous light fixtures for architectural lighting applications are known. In the case of fixtures that provide direct lighting, the source of illumination may be visible in its entirety through an output aperture of the light fixture or shielded by elements such as parabolic baffles or lenses. A light fixture presently used in a typical office environment comprises a troffer with at least one fluorescent lamp and a lens having prismatic elements for distributing the light. Also known are light fixtures that use parabolic reflectors to provide a desired light distribution. The choice of light fixture will depend on the objectives of the lighting designer for a particular application and the economic resources available. To meet his or her design objectives, the lighting designer, when choosing a light fixture, will normally consider a variety of factors including aesthetic appearance, desired light distribution characteristics, efficiency, lumen package, maintenance and sources of brightness that can detract from visual comfort and productivity.",
        "An important factor in the design of light fixtures for a particular application is the light source. The fluorescent lamp has long been the light source of choice among lighting designers in many commercial applications, particularly for indoor office lighting. For many years the most common fluorescent lamps for use in indoor lighting have been the linear T8 (1 inch diameter) and the T12 (1\u00bd inch diameter). More recently, however, smaller diameter fluorescent lamps have become available, which provide a high lumen output from a comparatively small lamp envelope. An example is the linear T5 (\u215d inch diameter) lamp manufactured by Osram/Sylvania and others. The T5 has a number of advantages over the T8 and T12, including the design of light fixtures that provide a high lumen output with fewer lamps, which reduces lamp disposal requirements and has the potential for reducing overall costs. The smaller-diameter T5 lamps also permit the design of smaller light fixtures.",
        "Some conventional fluorescent lamps, however, have the significant drawback in that the lamp surface is bright when compared to a lamp of larger diameter. For example, a conventional T5 lamp can have a surface brightness in the range of 5,000 to 8,000 footlamberts (FL), whereas the surface brightness of the larger T8 and T12 lamps generally is about 3,000 FL and 2,000 FL, respectively (although there are some versions of linear T8 and T12 lamps with higher brightness). The consequence of such bright surfaces is quite severe in applications where the lamps may be viewed directly. Without adequate shielding, fixtures employing such lamps are very uncomfortable and produce direct and reflected glare that impairs the comfort of the lighting environment. Heretofore, opaque shielding has been devised to cover or substantially surround a fluorescent lamp to mitigate problems associated with light sources of high surface brightness; however, such shielding defeats the advantages of a fluorescent lamp in regions of distribution where the lamp's surfaces are not directly viewed or do not set up reflected glare patterns. Thus, with conventional shielding designs, the distribution efficiencies and high lumen output advantages of the fluorescent lamp can be substantially lost.",
        "A further disadvantage to traditional parabolic and prismatic troffers is the presence of distracting dynamic changes in brightness level and pattern as seen by a moving observer in the architectural space. Additionally, traditional parabolic and prismatic troffers allow direct or only slightly obscured views of the lamp source(s)) at certain viewing angles (low angles for both the parabolic and prismatic and most transverse angle for prismatic). This unaesthetic condition is remedied by indirect and direct-indirect fixture designs, but typically with a significant loss of efficiency.",
        "Another known solution to the problem of direct glare associated with the use of high brightness fluorescent lamps is the use of biax lamps in direct-indirect light fixtures. This approach uses high brightness lamps only for the uplight component of the light fixture while using T-8 lamps with less bright surfaces for the light fixture's down-light component. However, such design approaches have the drawback that the extra lamps impair the designer's ability to achieve a desired light distribution from a given physical envelope and impose added burdens on lamp maintenance providers who must stock and handle two different types of lamps.",
        "Conventional parabolic light fixture designs have several negative features. One of these is reduced lighting efficiency. Another is the so-called \u201ccave effect,\u201d where the upper portions of walls in the illuminated area are dark. In addition, the light distribution of these fixtures often creates a defined line on the walls between the higher lit and less lit areas. This creates the perception of a ceiling that is lower than it actually is. Further, when viewed directly at high viewing angles, a conventional parabolic fixture can appear very dim or, even, off.",
        "The present invention overcomes the above-described disadvantages of light fixtures using brighter light sources by providing a configuration that appears to a viewer as though it has a source of lower brightness, but which otherwise permits the light fixture to advantageously and efficiently distribute light generated by the selected lamp, such as the exemplified T5 lamp. The light fixture of the present invention reduces distracting direct glare associated with high brightness light sources used in direct or direct-indirect light fixtures.

        "Referring to FIGS. 1-6 and 8-15, the lens assembly 100 of the present invention is constructed and arranged to direct light emitted by the light source 12 onto the area to be illuminated. A basic function of the lens assembly 100 is to diffuse the light from the light source 12 to effectively hide the light source 12 itself from view while reducing its brightness. Thus, one function of the lens assembly is to effectively become the source of light for the light fixture. This is accomplished in the preferred embodiment by providing the lens 110 of the lens assembly with an array 120 of longitudinally extending prismatic elements 122 with short focal lengths. Because of the short focal lengths of the prismatic elements, the light from the light source is focused to parallel images very close to the surface of the lens at large angles of convergence. Because of the large angles of convergence, the images overlap and the light is essentially diffused. The diffused light is then either directed onto the surface to be illuminated without further reflection or is reflected by the reflective surfaces of the hollow 32. Thus, the lens assembly provides a diffuse source of lowered brightness.",
        "As discussed above, the light source 12 is mounted in the trough and is recessed with respect to the side edges of the reflector assembly. This allows the lens 110 to be placed higher in the light fixture and provides geometric control of high-angle rays emanating from the lens in the transverse direction. Thus, light rays produced at high viewing angles are physically blocked by the bottom longitudinally extending side edges 28, 29 of the light fixture, which prevents glare at high angles in that transverse direction. The light fixture of the invention controls glare in the longitudinal direction, however, optically.",
        "High angle glare is reduced in the longitudinal direction as illustrated in FIGS. 18-21 and as described below. Thus, in this aspect, the light fixture of the invention prevents glare at high viewing angles through two mechanisms, geometrically in the transverse direction and optically in the longitudinal direction.",
        "In one aspect, the lens assembly 100 includes a lens 110 having a first end edge 112, an opposed second end edge 113, and a central lens portion 114 that extends between the first and second edges. The central lens portion 114 has a lens longitudinal axis that extends between the first and second end edges. In one example, the lens longitudinal axis is generally parallel to the light source longitudinal axis. In use, the lens 110 of the lens assembly is positioned with respect to the reflector assembly 20 of the light fixture such that substantially all of the light emitted by the light source 12 passes through the lens 110 prior to impacting portions of the reflective surfaces 33 of the reflector assembly and/or prior to being dispersed into the surrounding area.",
        "The lens 110 can be made from any suitable, code-compliant material such as, for example, a polymer or plastic. For example, the lens 110 can be b constructed by extruding pellets of meth-acrylate or polycarbonates into the desired shape of the lens. The lens 110 can be of a clear material or a translucent material. In another aspect, the lens can be colored or tinted.",

In one aspect of the invention, the central lens portion 114 is curved in cross-section such that at least a portion of the face 118 of the central lens portion has a concave or convex shape relative to the light source. In an alternative embodiment, at least a portion of the central lens portion 114 is planar in cross-section.",

In a further aspect, the lens is recessed within the reflector assembly such that a plane bisecting one of the respective first and second longitudinally extending side edges and a tangential portion of the lens is oriented at an acute angle \u03b3 to the generally horizontal plane extending between the first and second longitudinally extending side edges 28, 29. In one aspect, the acute angle \u03b3 is about and between 3\u00b0 to 30\u00b0. More particularly, the acute angle \u03b3 is about and between 05\u00b0 to 20\u00b0.

In use, an observer approaching the ceiling mounted light fixture of the present invention from the side (i.e., from a direction transverse to the base longitudinal axis) would not see the lens assembly until they passed into the lower viewing angles. In effect, portions of the reflector assembly act to block the view of the lens assembly from an observer at the higher viewing angles (i.e., the viewing angles closer to the horizontal ceiling plane).",
        "In one aspect, as shown in FIGS. 8-17, the prismatic surface 116 of the lens defines an array of linearly extending prismatic elements 120. In one example, each prismatic element 122 of the array 120 can extend substantially longitudinally between the first and second edge and edges 112, 114 of the lens. Alternatively, each prismatic element 122 of the array can extend linearly at an angle relative to the lens longitudinal axis. For example, each prismatic element thereof can extend generally transverse to the lens longitudinal axis. In a further aspect, each prismatic element 122 can have substantially the same shape or, alternatively, can vary in shape to cause differing visual effects on an external observer, lighting of the hollow surface, or light distribution to the room. In one aspect, each prismatic element has a portion that is rounded or has a curved surface.",

        "In another aspect, as shown in FIG. 11, a section of the array of prismatic elements 120 has a shape of a continuous wave. The section can be normal to the lens longitudinal axis. In one aspect, the shape of the continuous wave is a periodic waveform that has an arcuate section 128 formed in both the positive and negative amplitude portions of the periodic waveform (i.e., two prismatic elements are formed from each single periodic waveform). The period of the periodic waveform can be substantially constant or may vary along the array of prismatic elements. In one aspect, the periodic waveform is a substantially sinusoidal waveform. In this example, the common cusp \u201cedge\u201d 130, 132 between the two prismatic elements 122 forming from each periodic waveform occurs at the transition from positive/negative amplitude to negative/positive amplitude.",

In one other aspect, the plane of symmetry extends through the area desired to be illuminated. In one example, the lens 110 is constructed and arranged for detachable connection to a portion of the base surface 30 of the reflector assembly 20. In one particular example, the lens 110 is constructed and arranged for detachable connection to a portion of the trough 20 defined in the base member 22.",

Each of the first and second arms 140, 142 of the lens 110 has an end portion 144 that is sized and shaped for detachable engagement with the at least one male protrusion 45 in each of the respective first and second trough surfaces. Alternatively, each of the first and second side surfaces 44, 46 can define at least one slot 47 (FIG. 2) that is constructed and arranged to complementarily engage a male protrusion 145 projecting from the end portion 144 of each of the respective first and second arms 140, 142 of the lens. In use, the lens 110 may be removed from the reflector housing by applying force to the respective first and second lens edges 115, 117 of the central lens portion 114. The application of force causes the central lens portion 114 to bend and, resultantly, causes the respective end portions 144 of the first and second arms 140, 142 to move toward each other. Removal of the applied force allows the lens 110 to return toward its unstressed shape and allows the respective end portions 144 of the first and second arms 140, 142 to move away from each other.",

In this example, the relative position and shape of the reflector assembly and the lens assembly would prevent an observer, approaching the light fixture from a direction transverse to the base longitudinal axis, from viewing the light source through the bottom portion of the respective first or second arms of the lens.",
        "The lens assembly 100 can also include a conventional diffuser inlay 150 (FIG. 9), such as, for example, a OptiGrafix\u2122 film product, which is a diffuser film that can be purchased from Grafix\u00ae Plastics. The diffuser inlay 150 can be pliable or fixed in shape, transparent, semi-translucent, translucent, and/or colored or tinted. In one example, the diffuser inlay 150 has relatively high transmission efficiency while also scattering a relatively high amount of incident light to angles that are nearly parallel to its surface.

In one aspect of the present invention, there is a gap 152 formed between portions of the two adjoining rounded prismatic elements 122 extending between the respective apexes of the two adjoined prismatic elements and the bottom face 151 of the diffuser inlay 150. The formed gap enhances the total internal refection capabilities of the lens assembly 100.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 16-21, the lens assembly 100 and reflector assembly 20 of the present invention increase the light efficiency of the light fixture 10 and diffuse the light relatively uniformly so that the \u201ccave effect\u201d commonly noted in areas using conventional parabolic light fixtures in the ceiling are minimized. In one embodiment, the light fixture 15 or troffer of the present invention results in a luminare efficiency that is greater than about 80%, preferably greater than about 85%. The efficiency of the light fixture 10 measured by using a goniophotometer to compare the light energy from the light fixture at a given angle with the light from an unshielded light source, as specified in the application testing standard. The test results for an exemplary light fixture of the present invention and comparable results for a conventional parabolic light fixture are included in FIGS. 16 and 17. The light fixture of the present invention has reduced light control relative to conventional parabolic fixtures to provide a lit space (particularly the walls) with a bright appearance while still maintaining adequate control and comfortable viewing for today's office environment.",
        "The light fixture 10 of the present invention has a low height profile that allows for easy integration with other building systems and installations in low plenum spaces. In one aspect, the height profile of the light fixture is about or below 5 inches. More particularly, the height profile of the light fixture is about or below 4 inches. In another aspect, the height profile of the light fixture is about 3.25 inches.",
        "In one embodiment of the lens assembly 100 discussed above, the central lens portion 114 of the lens 110 has a concave face 118 oriented toward the light source 12 when the lens 110 is detachably secured to and within a portion of the reflector assembly 20. The array of male rounded prismatic elements 120 can be extruded along the length of the lens 110. In use, the lens of the present invention design has a striped visual characteristic to an external observer when back lit. These \u201cstripes\u201d provide for visual interest in the lens 110 and may be sized and shaped to mirror any ridges or grooves disposed therein portions of the reflective surfaces 33 of the hollow 32 of the reflector assembly 20. The \u201cstripes\u201d also help to mitigate the appearance of the image of the lamp (the light source) by providing strong linear boundaries that breakup and distract from the edges of the lamp against the less luminous trough 40 of the reflector assembly 20. In addition, the \u201cstripes\u201d allow for the light fixture 10 of the present invention to provide high angle light control in vertical planes that are substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the light fixture.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, a primary function of the lens is to optically reduce the brightness of the light source. In addition, the lens reduces the brightness of the light source even further at higher viewing angles in the longitudinal direction by the optical phenomenon of total internal reflection. This allows the efficient use of light sources of higher brightness while nevertheless reducing glare at high viewing angles.",
        "It will be appreciated that the light fixture of the invention utilizes a unique combination of features to reduce high-angle glare in the transverse and longitudinal directions. In the transverse direction, high angle glare is controlled primarily by the geometric relationship between the lamp and the reflector assembly of the light fixture, as discussed above, while in the longitudinal direction, high angle glare is controlled primarily by the lens optically. In the preferred embodiment, the lens itself essentially becomes the light source, which effectively reduces lamp brightness in both the transverse and longitudinal directions optically, to further reduce glare associated with lamps of high brightness.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 18-21, the optical creation of the dark \u201cstripes\u201d in the lens is illustrated. A \u201creverse ray,\u201d \u201cbackward ray\u201d or \u201cvision ray\u201d is a light ray that originates from a hypothetical external viewer's eye and is then traced through the optical system of the light fixture. Although there is no physical equivalent, it is a useful construct in predicting how a particular optical element will look to an observer. In the present invention, on at least one side at the respective common cusp edges 130, 132, 133 of adjoining rounded prismatic elements 122, there exists a sufficiently large angle of incidence \u03c9 relative to the normal extending from the point of incidence of the reverse ray at the lens to air interface that a reverse ray will undergo total internal reflection. In one aspect, the angle of incidence \u03c9 is at least about 40\u00b0. More particularly, the angle of incidence \u03c9 is at least about 45. Still more particularly, the angle of incidence \u03c9 is at least about 50\u00b0. In effect, the array of prismatic elements acts as an array of partial light pipes.",
        "Each rounded prismatic element 122 has a sufficiently large angular extent such that some total internal reflection at each common cusp edge is assured regardless of viewing angle. In one aspect, since each curved surface, or arcuate section, 128 of each rounded prismatic element 122 is substantially circular, if a reverse ray undergoes total internal reflection at one portion of the arcuate section and is subsequently reflected to another portion of the arcuate section, then total internal reflection will also occur at the second point of incidence because the arcuate section's geometry causes both interactions to have substantially the same angle of incidence. Generally then, a reverse ray that undergoes total internal reflection proximate a common cusp edge 133 will eventually exit the lens 110 out the same outer surface through which it entered the lens and will terminate on a surface or object in the room (as opposed to passing through the lens and terminating on the light source or the trough of the reflector assembly behind the lens). The reverse ray is said to be \u201crejected\u201d by the lens. This means that the brightness an external viewer will perceive at the common cusp edge 133 of adjoining rounded prismatic elements 122 is the brightness associated with a room surface because any real/forward light ray impinging on the viewer's eyes from this part of the lens must have originated from the room or space. Generally, the brightness of an object or surface in the room is much lower than that of the light source or trough that is viewed through the central portions of the arcuate sections 128 of each prismatic element 122. This high contrast in brightness between the common cusp edge 133 between adjoining rounded prismatic elements 122 and the central portion of the arcuate sections 128 of each prismatic element 122 is so high that it is perceived, to the external viewer, as dark stripes on a luminous background.",
        "The linear array 120 of prismatic elements 122 of the lens 100 assembly optically acts in the longitudinal direction to reduce high angle glare. This may be explained by considering a reverse ray that is incident on a portion of the prismatic surface of the lens proximate the common cusp edge 133 at the critical angle (the minimum angle of incidence \u03c9) for total internal reflection of the reverse ray. An observer viewing that portion of the lens (i.e., the portion of the area about the common cusp edge) would perceive it as being \u201cdark\u201d relative to that adjacent \u201cbright\u201d portion of the arcuate section proximate the rounded apex of each individual prismatic element. The array of linear elements thus optically controls the light emitted from the lamp in the longitudinal direction.",
        "In one example, as the lens 110 is viewed at higher and higher viewing angles (as when the observer is further from the light fixture) in a vertical plane parallel or near parallel to the base longitudinal axis of the base member, the striping effect visible on the surface of the lens becomes more pronounced. This is a result of the increase in that portion of the prismatic surface of the lens that undergoes total internal reflection and creates the dark strips. This results from viewing the lens at angles greater than the critical angle for total internal reflection of a \u201creverse ray.\u201d Thus, the effective width of each stripe grows as the lens is viewed at higher viewing angles, which is observed as the lens becoming dimmer at higher viewing angles.",
        "In the vertical planes extending between the base longitudinal axis of the reflector assembly base member and an axis transverse to the base member longitudinal axis, higher view angle control is achieved through a combination of the high angle control proffered by the linearly extending array of prismatic elements of the lens, as discussed immediately above, and the lens assembly being recessed within the reflector assembly. In the vertical plane substantially parallel to the base longitudinal axis of the reflector assembly, the optical elements of the lens assembly, i.e., the array of prismatic elements, exert primary glare control of the higher viewing angles. In the vertical plane substantially transverse to the base longitudinal axis of the reflector assembly, the recessed position of the lens assembly within the reflector assembly exerts primary glare control of the higher viewing angles.",
        "In one aspect, if the prismatic elements 122 are regularly spaced apart, the striping effect would also be regularly spaced. In another aspect, the prismatic elements 122 of the present invention can be sized and shaped to ensure some total internal reflection at all viewing angles so that the \u201cstriping\u201d is perceptible at all viewing angles.",
        "In use, normal movement of a viewer in the room does not change the viewer's vertical angle of view relative to the light fixture very rapidly and at far distances the stripes become less distinct. Therefore, the change is stripe width is not perceived as a dynamic motion but rather as a subtle changing of the overall lens brightness (i.e., brighter at low vertical angles and dimmer when viewed at high vertical angles).",
        "The rounded or curved surface portions of each prismatic element 122 provide a wide spreading or diffusion of any incident light. The high degree of diffusion helps to obscure the image of the light source 12 as seen through the lens 110 even when the light source is in relatively close proximity to the face of the lens 110 that is oriented toward the light source. This becomes increasingly apparent as the lens is viewed at higher vertical angles in the vertical plane substantially parallel to the light source.",
        "In another aspect, the rounded or curved surface portions of the prismatic elements 122 provide for a gradual change in the perceived brightness as a result of a change in the angle of view. In yet another aspect, in an embodiment of the invention in which each prismatic element 122 has substantially the same shape, the dark striping and the brighter areas of the lens 110 appear to change uniformly and smoothly from one prismatic element 122 to the next, adjoining prismatic element 122.",
