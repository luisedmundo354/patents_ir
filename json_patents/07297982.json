        "The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, a liquid crystal display device (hereinafter referred to as a liquid crystal display device) employing the semiconductor device and methods of fabricating the semiconductor device and the liquid crystal display device, and in particular to techniques of fabricating a thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as a TFT) comprising a polycrystalline semiconductor on an insulating substrate.",
        "There is a technique for fabricating peripheral circuits such as a driver circuit for driving pixels and a control circuit for controlling the driver circuit at the periphery of an insulating substrate on which pixels are fabricated in a liquid crystal display panel, for example.",
        "The process for fabricating a polycrystalline Si TFT (hereinafter referred to as a p-Si TFT) of the peripheral circuits is intrinsically a hot-temperature process, but a low-temperature process for it is realized by using a process explained below.",
        "The low-temperature process comprises formation of an amorphous silicon (hereinafter referred to as an a-Si) film, conversion of the a-Si film into a polycrystalline film by irradiation of excimer laser, formation of a gate insulating oxide film by plasma CVD or the like, formation of a gate electrode made of a metal or a metallic silicide by a sputtering method or the like, formation of source and drain regions by ion doping or ion implantation, and then ion activation by laser annealing.",
        "The above crystallization of an a-Si film by excimer laser uses a phenomenon that irradiation of a TV light pulse of about 20 ns melts the a-Si film and then crystallization occurs as the a-Si film cools.",
        "But with the conventional method, it is very difficult to control the grain sizes, orientations and positions of crystals in the polycrystalline film because of fast crystallization and non-equilibrium process.",
        "The larger the grain sizes are, the better the performance of the p-Si TFT becomes, but the wider the spread in the grain sizes becomes and consequently the wider the variability of TFT characteristics becomes.",
        "If the grain sizes are selected to be sufficiently smaller than the length of a channel of TFTs, the variability of the TFT characteristics becomes smaller, but the TFT characteristics are degraded.",
        "The p-Si TFTs of the peripheral circuits in the liquid crystal panel are of the so-called SOI (Silicon-On-Insulator) type using an insulating substrate such as a glass substrate and are not capable of establishing a substrate potential, and consequently an adverse effect such as a projection called a \u201ckink\u201d occurs in a current-voltage characteristic curve especially of the p-Si TFT constituting the high-performance peripheral circuits.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device or an LCD provided with TFTs having a polycrystalline film uniform in orientation of crystalline grains and containing few unwanted impurities introduced in grain boundaries (hereinafter referred to merely as grain boundary impurities) and a channel region of the TFTs formed of a polycrystalline film comprising a small number of crystal grains each having a diameter larger than a length of a channel of the TFTs and each having a grain boundary thereof aligned parallel with a source-drain direction of the TFTs.",

        "As shown in FIG. 1A, the p-Si TFT 100 of this embodiment comprises the p-Si island 1 formed on the insulating substrate 3 with the buffer layer 8 therebetween, the conductive film 2 which contacts the p-Si island 1 and crystal orientations of which are uniform in planes parallel with the major surface of the substrate, the gate insulating film 5 formed over the p-Si island 1, the gate electrode 4 formed over the p-Si island 1 with the gate insulating film 5 interposed therebetween, the source and drain regions 6, 7 disposed in the p-Si island 1 on opposite sides of the gate electrode 4.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2, the conductive layer 2 is formed with a two-dimensional rectangular array of openings each for forming the p-Si island 1 of the p-Si TFT 100.",
        "As indicated by broken lines in FIG. 1B, the sizes of the crystalline grains in the channel region are at least 3 \u03bcm in the TFTs of the peripheral circuit for driving the pixels. The channel region of the TFTs comprised of a small number (three, for example, as illustrated in FIG. 1B) of the polycrystalline grains the sizes of which are greater than the channel length L of the TFTs and the grain boundaries of which are parallel to the direction of the channel length L. A single grain extends a distance of at least 0.5 \u03bcm outwardly from both edges of the gate electrode 4.",
        "On the other hand, the TFTs for switching pixels need not provide such high performance as the TFTs for the peripheral circuits, and consequently plural crystalline grains of an approximately equal size in a range of 0.05 \u03bcm to 0.3 \u03bcm suffice for the TFTs for switching pixels.",

Although not shown in FIG. 1A, the source and drain regions 6,7 can employ the known LDD (Lightly Doped Drain) structure comprising a lightly doped region and a heavily doped region or the offset gate structure where the source and drain regions are offset from the edges of the gate electrode, respectively, if necessary.",

        "In FIGS. 3A-1 to 3A-3 and FIGS. 3B-1 to 3B-3, reference numeral 3 denotes the insulating substrate, 11 is the a-Si film formed on the insulating film 3, 13 is excimer laser light, 12a and 12b are nucleuses for the crystalline growth, and 1a and 1b are the p-Si films.",
        "A common method of forming the p-Si film by a low-temperature process comprises irradiation of the excimer laser light onto the a-Si film to melt to it and crystallization in the liquid phase of the melt as the film cools. A model of this low-temperature process is illustrated in FIGS. 3A-1 to 3A-3 and FIGS. 3B-1 to 3B-3.",
        "As illustrated in FIGS. 3A-1 and 3B-1, by irradiation of the excimer laser 13, the a-Si film 11 starts to melt from its surface and melts to a depth contacting the surface of the substrate 3.",
        "As illustrated in FIGS. 3A-2 and 3B-2, in the subsequent process of cooling, nucleuses 12a, 12b are produced in the a-Si film 11 mostly at the interfaces between the substrate 3 and the a-Si film 11 and then grow to form the p-Si films 1a, 1b as illustrated in FIGS. 3A-3 and 3B-3, respectively.",
        "When the density of irradiation energy is small, a large number of nucleuses 12a are produced as shown in FIG. 3A-2, grow in a direction of the thickness of the film, i.e. in a vertical direction, and finally form the p-Si film 1a composed of small grains as shown in FIG. 3A-3.",
        "On the other hand, when the density of irradiation energy is large, a small number of nucleuses 12b are produced as shown in FIG. 3B-2, grow both vertically and laterally at the same time, and finally form the p-Si film 1b composed of large grains as shown in FIG. 3B-3.",
        "As described above, the larger the grain sizes in the p-Si film are, the better the performance of the p-Si TFT becomes, and therefore it is the ultimate object to form the active elements of the peripheral circuit of the liquid crystal display panel in a single crystal.",
        "There is a limit to the grain sizes enlarged by simply adjusting the laser irradiation conditions for crystallization and the positions of crystalline grain formation cannot be controlled.",
        "To control the positions of crystalline grain formation and enlarge the grain sizes, it is necessary to initially form nucleuses at predetermined positions and then grow the nucleuses laterally. Based upon this concept, various methods have been proposed. An SLS method proposed by J. S. Im et al. (R. S. Sposili and J. S. Im: \u201cSequential lateral solidification of thin films on SiO2\u201d, Appl. Phys. Lett. 69(19), 4 Nov. 1996, pp. 2864-2866) and a method of irradiating through a phase-shift mask proposed by M.

Vol. 37(1998) pp. 5474-5479) realize relatively large grain sizes for the present.",
        "Both the two methods perform the formation of nucleuses and their lateral growth differently, but they do not control the sizes or the orientation of nucleuses. There are problems with the two methods in that, in the lateral growth, the growth speed is slow and the area of crystallization is small, due to limitation to an irradiation light-distribution.",
        "The embodiment of the present invention employs methods of growing crystals known as Metal Induced Crystallization (sometimes hereafter referred to as MIC) and Metal Induced Lateral Crystallization (sometimes hereafter referred to as MILC), and control the nucleation, and solves the problem with the lateral growth by using excimer laser.",
        "In the process of MIC, a thin metal film made of Au, Al, Sb, In, Pd, Ti, Ni or the like is disposed on the topside or underside of the a-Si film and thermally annealed, and consequently the transition temperature from a-Si to c-Si (crystalline Si) which is normally 600\u00b0 C. is lowered due to the presence of the thin metal film such that crystallization proceeds at a temperature lower than 600\u00b0 C.",
        "The mechanism of the above process has not been fully understood yet. In the case of four metals, Au, Al, Sb and In, it is thought that silicon is transported from the amorphous phase to the crystalline phase via the metal compound containing silicon due to difference between solubility of the metal into the a-Si in the compound of the metal and the a-Si and solubility of the metal into the c-Si in the compound of the metal and the c-Si (see E. Nygren, et. al, Appl. Phys. Lett. 52(6) pp. 439-441(1988) for further detail). On the other hand, in the case of Pd, Ti and Ni, it is thought that the growth from the a-Si phase into the c-Si phase occurs via formation of silicide (see C. Hayzelden and J. L. Batstone, J. Appl. Phys. 73(12) pp. 8279-8289(1993) for further detail).",
        "The metal induced crystallization (MIC) occurs in a region in contact with the thin metal film in the process of forming crystalline nucleuses assisted by the metal. It is observed that lateral crystalline growth occurs in a region not covered with the thin metal film, and this phenomenon is so-called metal induced lateral crystallization (MILC). In this method, although the growth speed of the p-Si film depends upon process conditions and material, it is on the order of \u03bcm per hour, very fast compared with usual solid-phase growth and this method provides large grains and aligns orientations of crystalline grains well enough in planes parallel with the major surface of the substrate (see Seok-Woon Lee, et. al, Appl. Phys. Lett. 66(13) pp. 1671-1673(1995) for further detail).",
        "FIGS. 4A-4D are cross-sectional views of the film for explaining the principle of the formation of the p-Si film composed of large grains by producing nucleuses using the MIC and MILC methods.",
        "Initially, as shown in FIG. 4A, a first a-Si thin film 11 is formed on a substrate 3, a metal film 14 serving as an undercoating film is deposited on the first a-Si thin film and then an opening 15 is made in the metal film 14 at a position corresponding to a p-Si island to be formed later by using a photolithography technique.",
        "Then thermal annealing is performed at a low temperature (lower than 600\u00b0 C.) insufficient to cause the transformation from the a-Si to the p-Si by using the MIC and MILC methods. In FIG. 4A, broken line indicate the edge of the p-Si island 1 (see FIG. 1A) to be fabricated subsequently. The a-Si film 11 under the metal film 14 is transformed into the p-Si film 16 (during this process the metal film 14 is absorbed by the p-Si film 16), and then the lateral growth of the crystalline grains, i.e. the above-explained MILC occurs in the region not originally covered with the metal film 14. Reference numeral 17 in FIG. 4B designate large crystalline grains produced by the MILC method.",
        "It is desirable that the thickness of the metal film 14 is selected to be such a value that the metal film 14 is absorbed completely by the a-Si film within a thermal annealing time required for the lateral crystalline growth of at least 0.5 \u03bcm in length, but the metal film 14 need not necessarily be absorbed completely.",
        "Even after the metal film 14 has been absorbed completely by the a-Si film, the portion of the film 11 at the center of the opening 15 remains the a-Si film as shown in FIG. 4B, and a single crystalline grain or large crystalline grains 17 having their orientations aligned parallel with each other in planes parallel with the major surface of the substrate are produced in contact with the a-Si film at the center.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 4C, a second a-Si film 18 is deposited over the entire area and irradiation of excimer laser (not shown) onto the a-Si film 18 crystallizes the a-Si film 18 according to the state of crystallization of the p-Si film 16 underlying the a-Si film 18 and serving as the undercoating film as shown in FIG. 4D. Especially in a portion of the a-Si film in proximity to large crystalline grains (as indicated by reference numeral 17, for example) large crystalline grains are formed aligned with the large crystalline grains. Reference numeral 1 denotes a p-Si film composed of large crystalline grains.",
        "In this embodiment, it is desirable to transform a portion intended for a channel region of the TFT into a single crystal, but even if the region is divided by grain boundaries, when the number of the grains is small and the directions of the grain boundaries are parallel with the flowing direction of electric current, the TFT performance is expected to be approximately the same as that obtained with the single crystal. To fabricate such a grain structure, an area irradiated by laser is moved over the film such that crystallization proceeds from a region intended for one of drain and source regions toward a region intended to face a gate electrode or such that crystallization proceeds from a region intended for one of drain and source regions through the region intended to face the gate electrode toward a region intended for the other of the source and drain regions.",
        "Then the unnecessary portion 21 of the p-Si film is removed by using the photolithography technique to form the p-Si island 1 indicated by broken lines in FIGS. 4A and 4B (see FIG. 1A also). There is retained a conductive layer made of the Si film and the metal absorbed therein and having its crystalline orientations aligned parallel with each other in the planes parallel with the major surface of the substrate, in order to be used for establishing a substrate potential.",
        "To obtain a crystalline grain of at least 10 \u03bcm in size which is a practical length for transistors, it is necessary to utilize diffusion of material by thermal gradient. There are a number of methods proposed for performing this by using laser irradiation, one of which will be explained by reference to FIGS. 5A-5C. FIGS. 5A-5C are illustrations for explaining an intensity distribution of excimer laser irradiation for formation of the p-Si TFT 100. FIG. 5A is a plan view of an arrangement of the p-Si islands 1 formed on the insulating substrate 3 (not shown) and the conductive layer 2 disposed in contact with the p-Si islands 1, and in FIG. 5A the gate electrodes 4 are indicated by broken lines to facilitate understanding. FIG. 5B illustrates an ideal intensity distribution of laser irradiation, and FIG. 5C illustrates a distribution of light transmission of a mask comprised of plural dielectric films.",
        "As shown in FIG. 5B, the ideal intensity distribution of laser irradiation is such that the irradiation extends wider than the width of a portion intended for one transistor in a direction of crystalline growth (a direction of the long sides of the p-Si islands 1 of FIG. 5A), but does not extend to adjacent portions intended for transistors.",
        "In practice, it is difficult to obtain the linear intensity distribution of laser irradiation for individual transistors as shown in FIG. 5B, consequently it is practically useful to use a mask obtained by fabricating plural dielectric layers in the form of steps, and FIG. 5C shows an example of the intensity distribution of such a mask.",
        "FIGS. 6A and 6B are illustrations for explaining a basic structure of the irradiation mask for fabrication of the peripheral circuit portion of the liquid crystal display panel, FIG. 6A is a schematic plan view of the mask having a dielectric multilayer portion for reflecting (i.e. blocking) laser light, and FIG. 6B illustrates a difference in transmission between the transmissive and non-transmissive portions of the dielectric multilayer films. In FIG. 6A, reference 20 denotes the mask and 19 is the laser-reflecting portion of the dielectric mask.",
        "The p-Si TFTs in the liquid crystal display panel is of the so-called SOI structure fabricated on the insulating substrate such as glass. As explained above, the potential of the substrate cannot be established by the substrate itself unlike Si LSIs because the substrate is an insulator, and the greatest problem that arises due to this is that a breakdown voltage between the source and drain regions is lowered. This is because holes generated by high electric fields present in the vicinity of the drain region are accumulated in the lower portion of the channel and cause a parasitic bipolar transistor to be turned on. This problem is solved by disposing a conductive film on the substrate and establishing the substrate potential, but the parasitic capacitance increases to such a great extent that desired TFT characteristics are not obtained.",
        "Especially the SOI structure has a reduced parasitic capacitance and an insulating substrate, and consequently provides excellent characteristics such as high speed operation, low power consumption and high breakdown voltages. But this useful structure produces the problem of lowering the source-drain breakdown voltage.",
        "The above-mentioned disposition of the conductive film on the substrate is such that the charges accumulated at the interface with the substrate are extracted by the conductive layer 2 disposed in contact with the above-explained electrode structure, i.e. the p-Si islands 1 and having its crystalline orientations aligned to eliminate causes of unstable operation. This structure is known as the field shield in the conventional SOI structure (Proc. of 5th Int'l Symp. on SOI Tech. and Devices, Vol. 92-13, p64 (1992). In this embodiment, the undercoating film used for the MIC and MILC processes is remaining even during the process of laser crystallization. The accumulated charges are extracted more efficiently from the central portion of the channel as well as the ends of the source and drain regions compared with the conventional structures, though resistance of these regions is very high because of a small amount of the metal in these regions.",
        "Instead of disposing the metal film 14 on the top surface of the a-Si film 11 as shown in FIG. 4A, the metal film 14 can be disposed under the a-Si film 11 as shown in FIG. 7A. The process steps following the step shown in FIG. 7A are similar to those in the case where the metal film 14 is disposed on the top surface of the a-Si film 11, as shown in FIGS. 7B-7D.",
        "Instead of the metal film, a film made of metallic suicides such as titanium silicide, tungsten silicide or molybdenum silicide can be used in this embodiment.",
        "A fabrication process in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention will be explained by reference to FIGS. 8A-8F.",
        "Initially, as shown in FIG. 8A, a buffer layer 8 made of SiO2 is formed on the insulating substrate 3 made of glass, then the a-Si film 11 of 20 nm at the most in thickness is formed on the buffer layer 8 by a plasma CVD method, and is heated at 450\u00b0 C. for at least 30 minutes to reduce the amount of hydrogen contained in the a-Si film to 1 atomic % at the most.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 8B, at least one layer 14 made of metals such as W, Au, Al, Sb, In, Pd, Ti or Ni or silicides of those metals is formed on the a-Si film 11 by a sputtering method, and is formed with a two-dimensional rectangular array of openings (slits) 15 each corresponding to a TFT region by a photolithography technique.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 8C, the a-Si film 11 is thermally annealed at a temperature equal to or less than 600\u00b0 C. to transform the a-Si film 11 into the p-Si film by solid-phase growth. Initially the a-Si film 11 underlying the film 14 is transformed into the p-Si film 16 (during this process the film 14 is absorbed by the p-Si film 16), and then the lateral growth of crystalline grains, i.e. the above-described MILC occurs in the region not covered with the film 14. Reference numeral 17 denotes large crystalline grains produced by the MILC.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 8D, another a-Si film 18 of at least 20 nm in thickness is formed on the film formed as shown in FIG. 8C by a plasma CVD method, and then is heated at 450\u00b0 C. for at least 30 minutes to reduce the amount of hydrogen contained in the a-Si film to 1 atomic % at the most.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 8E, XeCl excimer laser of 308 nm in wavelength or KrF excimer laser of 248 nm in wavelength (not shown) is irradiated onto the a-Si film 18 to transform the a-Si film 18 into the p-Si film to form a region corresponding to the p-Si island 1.",
        "Then the p-Si film 21 surrounding the p-Si island 1 is removed by a photolithography technique to provide the shape as shown in FIG. 8F.",
        "Then the thus obtained p-Si island 1 is processed to complete the p-Si TFT 100 shown in FIG. 1A by using known techniques. The p-Si film 16 in FIG. 8F corresponds to the conductive film 2 in FIG. 1A.",
        "In the above-explained method, the metal film having the openings are disposed over the a-Si film formed on the substrate, but in an alternative method the a-Si film can be formed over the metal film having the openings and initially formed on the substrate. The following explains this alternative method.",
        "Initially, as shown in FIG. 9A, a buffer layer 8 made of SiO2 is formed on the insulating substrate 3 made of glass, then at least one layer 14 made of metals such as W, Au, Al, Sb, In, Pd, Ti or Ni or silicides of those metals is formed on the buffer layer 8 by a sputtering method, and then is formed with a two-dimensional rectangular array of openings (slits) 15 each corresponding to a TFT region by a photolithography technique.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 9B, the a-Si film 11 of 20 nm at the most in thickness is formed on the substrate 3 having the film 14 formed with the openings 15 by a plasma CVD method, and is heated at 450\u00b0 C. for at least 30 minutes to reduce the amount of hydrogen contained in the a-Si film to 1 atomic % at the most.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 9C, the a-Si film 11 is thermally annealed at a temperature equal to or less than 600\u00b0 C. to transform the a-Si film 11 into the p-Si film by solid-phase growth.

Reference numeral 17 denote large crystalline grains produced by the MILC.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 9D, another a-Si film 18 of at least 20 nm in thickness is formed on the film formed as shown in FIG. 9C by a plasma CVD method, and then is heated at 450\u00b0 C. for at least 30 minutes to reduce the amount of hydrogen contained in the a-Si film to 1 atomic % at the most.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 9E, XeCl excimer laser of 308 nm in wavelength or KrF excimer laser of 248 nm in wavelength (not shown) is irradiated onto the a-Si film 18 to transform the a-Si film 18 into the p-Si film to form a region corresponding to the p-Si island 1.",

        "As still another alternative, the process steps of forming a film made of metal or metallic silicide and having the openings 15 can be repeated twice with the process of forming the a-Si film interposed therebetween, that is, the two films made of metal or metallic silicide can be disposed to sandwich the a-Si film. The following explains this alternative.",
        "Initially, as shown in FIG. 10A, a buffer layer 8 made of SiO2 is formed on the insulating substrate 3 made of glass, then a film 14 made of tungsten, tungsten silicide, or metals such as Au, Al, Sb, Pd and Ni, for example, is formed at a region A corresponding to the peripheral circuit on the insulating substrate 3 and an opening 15A corresponding to a TFT region is made in the film 14A by a photolithography technique.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 10B, a-Si film 11 of 20 nm at the most in thickness is formed at the region A corresponding to the peripheral circuit and a region B corresponding to the pixel area by a plasma CVD method, and is heated at 450\u00b0 C. for at least 30 minutes to reduce the amount of hydrogen contained in the a-Si film 11 to 1 atomic % at the most.",

Then the a-Si film 11 is thermally annealed at a temperature equal to or less than 600\u00b0 C. to transform the a-Si film 11 into the p-Si film by solid-phase growth. The subsequent process steps are the same as those with the previous embodiments.",

Then a tungsten film of 50 nm in thickness is formed over the entire surface of the insulating substrate made of glass, a Pd film of 1 nm in thickness is formed over the tungsten film, and then the openings each accommodating a transistor are made in the two metal films in accordance with the arrangement of the p-Si islands for transistors.",
