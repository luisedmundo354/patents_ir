        "The present embodiment relates generally to cement compositions and methods for cementing an area using such cement compositions. In certain examples, methods for cementing in a subterranean zone are described.",
        "In the drilling and completion of an oil or gas well, a cement composition is often introduced in the wellbore for cementing pipe string or casing. When the desired drilling depth of the well is reached, a cement composition is pumped into the annular space between the walls of the wellbore and the casing. The cement composition sets in the annular space, supporting and positioning the casing, and forming a substantially impermeable barrier, or cement sheath, which isolates the wellbore from subterranean zones.",
        "Most cements contain chromium compounds because the raw material (typically shale) from which cements are made usually contains chromium compounds. When the cements are mixed with water, the chromium compounds appear as Cr+6 (chromate) dissolved in the water. The dissolved chromate presents a health risk to humans, for example, allergic reactions.",
        "Ferrous sulfate is known to reduce Cr+6 to Cr+3, which is less soluble in cement-water mixtures. Ferrous sulfate has been dry blended with cement during the manufacturing of the cement, but in such a blend, the ferrous sulfate remains effective for only a limited period of time. In addition, the solubility of ferrous sulfate is such that it will settle out of solution if formulated as a liquid additive.",
        "According to embodiments described herein, methods of cementing an area are provided. Certain methods include preparing a cement composition by mixing a cementitious material with water and an aqueous suspension comprising water, zeolite and a chromate reducing agent, placing the cement composition in the area, and allowing the cement composition to set therein.",
        "According to some embodiments, the aqueous suspension comprises zeolite in an amount of from about 67 weight percent to about 100 weight percent by weight of the water, and chromate reducing agent in an amount that is from about 42 weight percent to about 167 weight percent by weight of the zeolite and from about 28 weight percent to about 111 weight percent by weight of the water in the aqueous suspension.",
        "According to other embodiments, the aqueous suspension comprises zeolite in an amount of more than about 56 weight percent to less than about 111 weight percent of the weight of the water, and chromate reducing agent in an amount that is about 111 weight percent of the weight of the water, and more than about 100 weight percent to about 167 weight percent of the weight of the zeolite.",
        "According to still other embodiments, the aqueous suspension comprises zeolite in an amount of about 67 weight percent to about 100 weight percent of the weight of the water, and chromate reducing agent in an amount that is from more than about 100 weight percent to about 111 weight percent of the weight of the water, and about 167 weight percent of the weight of the zeolite.",
        "According to still further embodiments, the aqueous suspension comprises zeolite in an amount of about 67 weight percent of the weight of the water, and chromate reducing agent in an amount that is from about 56 weight percent to about 111 weight percent of the weight of the water, and from about 83 weight percent to about 167 weight percent of the weight of the zeolite.",
        "According to certain embodiments described herein, an aqueous suspension comprises water, zeolite and stannous sulfate or ferrous sulfate as a chromate reducing agent. The ferrous sulfate can be any of the hydrates of ferrous sulfate, such as the monohydrate (FeSO4.H2O), the tetrahydrate (FeSO4.4H2O), the pentahydrate (FeSO4.5H2O), and the heptahydrate (FeSO4.7H2O). Hydrated forms of stannous sulfate, if any, could also prove to be suitable.",

        "Zeolites are porous alumino-silicate minerals that may be either a natural or manmade material. Manmade zeolites are based on the same type of structural cell as natural zeolites and are composed of aluminosilicate hydrates having the same basic formula as given below. It is understood that as used in this application, the term \u201czeolite\u201d means and encompasses all natural and manmade forms of zeolites. All zeolites are composed of a three-dimensional framework of SiO4 and AlO4 in a tetrahedron, which creates a very high surface area. Cations and water molecules are entrained into the framework. Thus, all zeolites may be represented by the crystallographic unit cell formula:\n\nMa/n[(AlO2)a(SiO2)b].xH2O\n\nwhere M represents one or more cations such as Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Li or Ba for natural zeolites and NH4, CH3NH3, (CH3)3NH, (CH3)4N, Ga, Ge and P for manmade zeolites; n represents the cation valence; the ratio of b:a is in a range of from greater than or equal to 1 to less than or equal to 5; and x represents the moles of water entrained into the zeolite framework.",
        "Compositions for cementing are also described herein. According to certain embodiments, the compositions comprise cementitious material and an aqueous suspension of water, zeolite and a chromate reducing agent. According to certain embodiments, the aqueous suspension is present in the cement composition in an amount sufficient to provide the cement composition with a chromate reducing agent content of up to about 0.5% by weight of the cementitious material.",
        "A variety of cementitious materials can be used with the present embodiments, including but not limited to hydraulic cements. Hydraulic cements set and harden by reaction with water, and are typically comprised of calcium, aluminum, silicon, oxygen, and/or sulfur. Hydraulic cements include Portland cements, pozzolan cements, gypsum cements, aluminous cements, silica cements, and alkaline cements. According to certain examples, the cementitious material comprises at least one API Portland cement. As used herein, the term API Portland cement means any cement of the type defined and described in API Specification 10A, 23rd Edition, Oct. 1, 2002, of the American Petroleum Institute, (ANSI/API 10A/ISO 10426-1-2001) such as Classes A, B, C, G, and H.",
        "Water in the cement compositions according to the present embodiments is present in an amount sufficient to make a slurry of a desired density. The water used to form a slurry can be fresh water, unsaturated salt solution, including brines and seawater, and saturated salt solution. Generally, any type of water can be used, provided that it does not contain an excess of compounds that are well known to those skilled in the art to adversely affect properties of the cement composition. In certain embodiments, the water is present in an amount of about 20% to about 150% by weight of the cementitious material in the cement composition.",
        "A variety of additives may be added to a cement composition that includes an aqueous suspension of zeolite and a chromate reducing agent. Such additives include density modifying materials (e.g., fly ash, silica flour, sodium silicate, microfine sand, iron oxides and manganese oxides), dispersing agents, set retarding agents, set accelerating agents, fluid loss control agents, strength retrogression control agents, and viscosifying agents, all of which are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.",
        "The following examples are illustrative of the methods and compositions discussed above.",
        "Components of the types and amounts reported in Table 1A were mixed to form Sample Nos. 1-45. The chromate reducing agent (\u201cCRA\u201d ) was SnSO4 or FeSO4.7H2O as indicated in the table. SnSO4 and FeSO4.7H2O were each obtained from Fisher Laboratory Chemicals. The zeolite used in Sample Nos. 1-45 was chabazite, which was mined from Bowie, Ariz., USA and obtained from C2C Zeolite Corporation, Calgary, Canada. The water used to form the suspensions was tap water.",
        "The reported amount of chromate reducing agent and the reported amount of zeolite were weighed and added to a glass beaker. The reported amount of water (grams) was added to the beaker, and the chromate reducing agent, zeolite and water in the beaker were hand mixed with a stirring rod at room temperature. The amounts of chromate reducing agent and zeolite are reported in grams, and also in a weight percent of the total weight of the mixture (chromate reducing agent, zeolite and water).",

Generally according to this API Specification, 250 ml of each cement composition was poured into its own 250 ml graduated glass cylinder and then sealed with a plastic film wrap to prevent evaporation. A two-hour test period was then initiated, in which the graduated cylinders were left standing. After two hours, the free fluid that had gathered on top of each cement composition inside the cylinder was measured. The percent of free fluid was calculated as the measured milliliters of free fluid multiplied by 100 and then divided by the initial 250 milliliters of the cement composition.",
