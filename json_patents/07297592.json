        "This is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 10/109,527 filed Mar. 27, 2002 now abandoned which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.",
        "1. Technical Field",
        "The present invention relates generally to semiconductor technology and data retention in semiconductor memories.",
        "2. Background Art",
        "Various types of memories have been developed in the past as electronic memory media for computers and similar systems. Such memories include electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) and electrically programmable read only memory (EPROM). Each type of memory had advantages and disadvantages. EEPROM can be easily erased without extra exterior equipment but with reduced data storage density, lower speed, and higher cost. EPROM, in contrast, is less expensive and has greater density but lack erasability.",
        "A newer type of memory called \u201cFlash\u201d EEPROM, or Flash memory, has become extremely popular because it combines the advantages of the high density and low cost of EPROM with the electrical erasability of EEPROM. Flash memory can be rewritten and can hold its contents without power. It is used in many portable electronic products, such as cell phone, portable computers, voice recorders, etc. as well as in many larger electronic systems, such as cars, planes, industrial control systems, etc.",
        "In Flash memory, bits of information are programmed individually as in the older types of memory, such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and static random access memory (SRAM) memory chips. However, in DRAMs and SRAMs where individual bits can be erased one at a time, Flash memory must currently be erased in fixed multi-bit blocks or sectors.",
        "Conventionally, Flash memory is constructed of many Flash memory cells where a single bit is stored in each memory cell and the cells are programmed by hot electron injection and erased by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. However, increased market demand has driven the development of Flash memory cells to increase both the speed and the density. Newer Flash memory cells have been developed that allow more than a single bit to be stored in each cell.",
        "One memory cell structure involves the storage of more than one level of charge to be stored in a memory cell with each level representative of a bit. This structure is referred to as a multi-level storage (MLS) architecture. Unfortunately, this structure inherently requires a great deal of precision in both programming and reading the differences in the levels to be able to distinguish the bits. If a memory cell using the MLS architecture is overcharged, even by a small amount, the only way to correct the bit error would be to erase the memory cell and totally reprogram the memory cell. The need in the MLS architecture to precisely control the amount of charge in a memory cell while programming also makes the technology slower and the data less reliable. It also takes longer to access or \u201cread\u201d precise amounts of charge. Thus, both speed and reliability are sacrificed in order to improve memory cell density.",
        "An even newer technology allowing multiple bits to be stored in a single cell is known as \u201cMirrorBit\u00ae\u201d Flash memory has been developed. In this technology, a memory cell is essentially split into two identical (mirrored) parts, each of which is formulated for storing one of two independent bits. Each dual bit flash memory cell, like a traditional Flash cell, has a gate with a source and a drain. However, unlike a traditional Flash cell in which the source is always connected to an electrical source and the drain is always connected to an electrical drain, each dual bit flash memory cell can have the connections of the source and drain reversed during operation to permit the storing of two bits.",
        "The dual bit flash memory cell has a semiconductor substrate with implanted conductive bitlines. A multilayer storage layer, referred to as a \u201ccharge-trapping dielectric layer\u201d, is formed over the semiconductor substrate. The charge-trapping dielectric layer can generally be composed of three separate layers: a first insulating layer, a charge-trapping layer, and a second insulating layer. Wordlines are formed over the charge-trapping dielectric layer perpendicular to the bitlines. Programming circuitry controls two bits per cell by applying a signal to the wordline, which acts as a control gate, and changing bitline connections such that one bit is stored by source and drain being connected in one arrangement and a complementary bit is stored by the source and drain being interchanged in another arrangement.",
        "Programming of the cell is accomplished in one direction and reading is accomplished in a direction opposite that in which it is programmed.",
        "A major problem with the MirrorBit architecture has been discovered that the charges, which represent bits of data, tend to drain away over time through the semiconductor device leading to poor data retention. The cause of this charge leakage was not fully understood.",
        "A solution to this problem has been long sought but has long eluded those skilled in the art.",
        "The present invention provides a manufacturing method for a MirrorBit\u00ae Flash memory and includes providing a semiconductor substrate and depositing a charge-trapping dielectric layer. First and second bitlines are implanted and a wordline layer is deposited. A hard mask layer is deposited over the wordline layer. A photoresist is deposited over the wordline layer and used to form a hard mask. The photoresist is removed. The wordline layer is processed using the hard mask to form a wordline and the hard mask is removed. A data retention liner covers the wordline and the charge-trapping dielectric layer. An interlayer dielectric layer is deposited over the data retention liner. It has been unexpectedly discovered that the reason that charge leakage occurs is that hydrogen in the region of the charge-trapping layer acts as a carrier for the electrical charge and causes the data retention capability to be diminished. The hydrogen apparently is a result of the processes used at the back end of the line to produce various layers such as the etch stop layer.

The hydrogen apparently is a result of the processes used at the back end of the line to produce various layers such as the etch stop layer. The data retention layer has reduced hydrogen and charge loss with subsequent data loss is substantially reduced.",

        "Referring now to FIG. 2 (PRIOR ART), therein is shown a circuit schematic of a portion of one of the M\u00d7N array cores 104 of FIG. 1 (PRIOR ART). The circuit schematic shows a line of memory cells 200, which includes memory cells 201 through 204 and which together can form an 8-bit word. Each of the memory cells 201 through 204 is connected to a wordline 206, which acts as a control gate. Each of the memory cells 201 through 204 has two associated bitlines with most of the memory cells having a common bitline. The memory cell 201 has associated bitlines 208 and 209; the memory cell 202 has associated bitlines 209 and 210; the memory cell 203 has associated bitlines 210 and 211; and the memory cell 204 has associated bitlines 211 and 212.",
        "Depending upon a signal on the wordline and the connection of the bitlines in a memory cell to an electrical source or drain, the memory cells 201 through 204 are capable of writing, reading, and erasing bits at locations 215 through 222. For example, control of the bit at location 215 is achieved through connection of the drain to the bitline 208 and the source to the bitline 209. Similarly, control of the bit at location 216 is achieved through connection of the drain to the bitline 209 and the source to the bitline 208. Although adjacent memory cells share common bitlines, the adjacent memory cells do not interfere with each other because the memory cells are programmed one at a time and only one memory cell is active at a time while programming.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 3 (PRIOR ART), therein is shown a plan view of a portion of one of the M\u00d7N array cores 104 of FIG. 1 (PRIOR ART). The semiconductor substrate 102 has a plurality of implanted bitlines 304 extending in parallel with a plurality of formed wordlines 302 extending in parallel and at right angles to the plurality of implanted bitlines 304. The wordlines 302 and bitlines 304 have contacts and interconnections (not shown) to the programming circuitry represented in part by x-decoders 108 and y-decoders 110 of FIG. 1 (PRIOR ART).",
        "Referring now to FIG. 4 (PRIOR ART), therein is shown a cross-sectional isometric view of a typical dual bit flash memory cell along the line 4-4 of FIG. 3 (PRIOR ART), such as a memory cell 400. The semiconductor substrate 102 is a p-doped silicon substrate with a threshold adjustment implant 402 of a p-type material, such as boron. The threshold adjustment implant 402 provides a region that is more heavily doped than the semiconductor substrate 102 itself and assists in the control of the threshold voltage of the memory cell 400.",
        "A charge-trapping dielectric layer 404 is deposited over the semiconductor substrate 102. The charge-trapping dielectric layer 404 generally can be composed of three separate layers: a first insulating layer 406, a charge-trapping layer 408, and a second insulating layer 410. The first and second insulating layers 406 and 410 are of an oxide dielectric such as silicon dioxide (SiO2) and the charge-trapping layer 408 is of a nitride dielectric such as silicon nitride (SixNy). The oxide-nitride-oxide configuration is frequently referred to as a matter of convenience as an \u201cONO layer\u201d.",
        "The bitlines 304 of FIG. 3 (PRIOR ART) are implanted under the charge-trapping dielectric layer 404 in the semiconductor substrate 102 as typified by first and second conductive bitlines 412 and 414. They are typically of an implanted n-type material, such as arsenic, and can include an oxide portion (not shown) in some embodiments. The first and second conductive bitlines 412 and 414 are spaced apart and define a volume between them with the threshold adjustment implant 402, which is a channel 416.",
        "A material, such as polysilicon, is deposited over the charge-trapping dielectric layer 404, patterned, etched, and stripped resulting in a wordline 418. The wordline 418 is one of the wordlines 302 in FIG. 3 (PRIOR ART).",
        "It is understood that the implementation of each step in manufacturing has associated processing steps.",
        "The locations 420 through 422 indicate where bits can be stored in the memory cell 400 and locations 424 and 426 are adjacent locations, which are independent of the memory cell 400.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 5, therein is shown a cross-sectional view of a partially processed memory cell 500 similar to a cross-sectional view along line 5-5 in FIG. 3 (PRIOR ART). A p-type silicon substrate 501 has been implanted or processed with a p-type threshold adjustment implant 502.",
        "A charge-trapping dielectric layer 504 is deposited over the silicon substrate 501. The charge-trapping dielectric layer 504 generally can be composed of three separate layers: a first insulating layer 506, a charge-trapping layer 508, and a second insulating layer 510. The first and second insulating layers 506 and 510 may be of an oxide dielectric such as silicon dioxide (SiO2) and the charge-trapping layer 508 may be of a nitride dielectric such as silicon nitride (SixNy) to form an ONO layer. It will be noted that the present invention is not limited to specific dielectric or charge-trapping materials.",
        "The bitlines, as typified by a first n-type bitline 512, are implanted under the charge-trapping dielectric layer 504 in the silicon substrate 501 and a wordline material 515, such as polysilicon, has been deposited over the charge-trapping dielectric layer 504. Again, it will be noted that the present invention is not limited to specific bitline or gate materials. For example, NPN structures are shown but the structures can also be PNP.",
        "A hard mask material 516 has been deposited over the wordline material 515 and has not been processed. The hard mask material 516 can act as an ARC or an ARC can be deposited as a separate layer, such as an optional ARC material 517, but more importantly, the hard mask material 516 is formulated to be a material that can be stripped off the wordline material 515 without the stripping process damaging any exposed portion of the charge-trapping dielectric layer 504 at the same time.",
        "In order to be strippable without damaging the charge-trapping dielectric layer 504, the hard mask material 516 should be properly formulated to not affect the middle layer of the charge-trapping dielectric layer 504. For example, where the nitride layer is the middle layer, an oxide such as silicon oxide would be the proper formulation.",
        "A photoresist 518 has been deposited over the hard mask material 516 or the optional ARC material 517. The optional ARC material 517, the hard mask material 516 and the photoresist 518 have been processed to form openings 521 through 523 to expose the wordline material 515.",
        "In FIG. 5, both the photoresist 518 and the optional ARC material 517 have been processed (i.e., the materials have been deposited, masked, patterned, exposed, and etched) for processing the hard mask material 516.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 6, therein is shown the structure of FIG. 5 after formation of a hard mask 519 and removal of the photoresist 518 and the optional ARC material 517. The hard mask 519 alone is used to create the structure of FIG. 7.",
        "It should be noted that in the past, the photoresist and ARC would be used to create the wordlines 525 through 528 (without the hard mask material 516) of FIG. 7 so the ONO layer would be exposed between the wordlines and the problems noted above would occur.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 7, therein is shown the structure of FIG. 6 after processing using the hard mask 519 to form wordlines 525 through 528. The processing using the hard mask 519 exposes the charge-trapping dielectric layer 504 at exposed areas 530 through 532. However, since the hard mask material 516 material is specifically formulated so as to not damage the charge-trapping dielectric layer 504 during removal, the charge-trapping dielectric layer 504 will not be damaged at the exposed areas 530 through 532 when the hard mask 519 is removed.",
        "For example, where the hard mask 519 is of silicon oxide, its removal would only cause openings in the top oxide layer of the ONO layers and not of the nitride layer. Thus, the subsequent pre-metal deposition oxide strip and oxide spacer etch photoresist strip would not penetrate the nitride layer. This would leave the nitride layer and the bottom oxide layer to protect the semiconductor substrate.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 8 therein is shown the structure of FIG. 7 after removal of the hard mask 519. An inorganic spacer material 534 has been deposited because it is required for the peripheral portions of the Flash EEPROM 100 of FIG. 1.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 9, therein is shown the structure of FIG. 8 after etching of the spacer material 534 to form spacers 535 through 538 around the respective wordlines 525 through 528. If the spacers 535 through 538 are not formed, an additional masking step of the entire core is required or additional processing steps to provide access to the bitlines.",
        "The memory cell 500 is also shown after application of the saliciding process to grow metal salicides 540 through 543, such as cobalt silicide, titanium silicide, or nickel silicide contacts on top of the respective wordlines 525 through 528.",
        "Since the metal silicide will not form on the exposed ONO layer or the nitride spacers, which do not contain silicon, the metal silicide will be self-aligned on the tops of the polysilicon wordlines; i.e., salicide will be grown.",
        "As explained briefly earlier, major problem with the MirrorBit architecture has been discovered that the charges, which represent bits of data, tend to drain away over time through the semiconductor device leading to poor data retention. The cause of this charge leakage previously was not fully understood.",
        "It has been unexpectedly discovered that the reason that charge leakage occurs is that hydrogen in the region of the charge-trapping layer acts as a carrier for the electrical charge and causes the data retention capability to be diminished. The hydrogen apparently is a result of the processes used at the back end of the line to produce various layers such as the etch stop layer.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 10, therein is shown the structure of FIG. 9 after deposition of a data retention liner 546 in accordance with the present invention. The data retention liner 546 is deposited over the surface of the wordlines 525 through 528, the spacers 535 through 538, and the charge-trapping layer 504. The data retention liner 546 has the characteristic of having reduced hydrogen by being deposited by a low hydrogen retention process.",
        "The term \u201creduced hydrogen\u201d as used herein means that the data retention liner 546 has under about 2.7% nitrogen-hydrogen and silicon-hydrogen bondings based on Fourier transformation infra-red (FTIR) data.",
        "In one embodiment, the liner is a silicon nitride. Examples of the processes, which can be used to deposit a nitride data retention liner include:\n\n    \n    \n        Tetrachlorosilane deposition (SiCl4).\n        Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) nitride at a high temperature from 500\u00b0 C. to 550\u00b0 C. without using a hydrogen containing carrier gas such as ammonia and an anneal at a higher temperature at about 600\u00b0 C.\n        PECVD nitride deposition at a high temperature from 500\u00b0 C. to 550\u00b0 C. with an oxygen anneal at a higher temperature from 600\u00b0 C. to 1000\u00b0 C.",
        "It has been found that the latter two PECVD nitride depositions increase film density and thus make the data retention liner of greater density than other deposition processes and thus less susceptible to hydrogen entrapment. With higher density comes the characteristic of being less permeable to hydrogen. The data retention liner 546 may also be used as an etch stop layer.",
        "Further, it has been discovered that depositing the nitride without a hydrogen containing carrier gas such as ammonia unexpectedly slows the deposition rate of the nitride. The slowing can be to the extent that an \u201cultra-slow deposition rate\u201d is achieved which is defined herein as being 200% slower than deposition rate of nitride with ammonia. This permits superior process control resulting in precise thickness control and uniformity within a wafer as well as from wafer to wafer.",
        "The superior process control has proved to be crucial for very thin nitride film depositions in the range of 100 \u212b to 500 \u212b. These very thin nitride films are particularly useful for data retention layers because they can replace etch stop layers (ESLs).",
        "By annealing at about 600\u00b0 C., it has been further discovered that an \u201cextremely high density\u201d is achieved which is defined herein as meaning that the data retention liner 546 has a density greater than about 2.79 g/cc after deposition without ammonia.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 11, therein is shown the structure of FIG. 10 after deposition of the first interlayer dielectric layer 548 over the data retention liner 546. The first interlayer dielectric layer 548 can be a material such as borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG).",
        "Referring now to FIG. 12, therein is shown a simplified process chart 600 of the present invention which includes: providing semiconductor substrate 602; implanting threshold adjustment implant 604; depositing charge-trapping dielectric layer 606; implanting bitlines 608; depositing wordline layer 610; depositing hard mask material 612; depositing ARC material 614; depositing photoresist 616; forming hard mask 618; removing photoresist layer (and optional ARC material) 620; forming wordline 622; removing hard mask 624; forming spacer 626; growing salicide 628; depositing data retention liner 630; and depositing first interlayer dielectric layer 632. Various alternative sequences, additions, and deletions to this process chart would be obvious to those skilled in the art from a detailed reading of the present disclosure.",
        "Various implementations of the method may be used in different electronic devices and especially the dual bit memory cell architecture may be achieved according to one or more aspects of the present invention. In particular, the invention is applicable to memory devices wherein both bits in a dual bit cell are used for data or information storage.",
        "While the invention has been described in conjunction with a specific best mode, it is to be understood that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the aforegoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the included claims. All matters hither-to-fore set forth or shown in the accompanying drawings are to be interpreted in an illustrative and non-limiting sense."
