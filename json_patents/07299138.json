        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "This invention relates to a stress measurement method and its apparatus. The stress of material in the process, goods (for example, single crystal of semiconductor etc.) and unknown stresses in the composed parts under the power station, high pressure plants, airplane, vehicles, various kinds of device, and the material of parts inthe other constructions etc. are especially able to rapidly quantitatively obtain by use of this invention.",
        "2. Related Art",
        "The various kind of vehicles or constructions mainly made of metals are generally used for semi permanent term. Contrarily, each part is necessary to be repaired or exchanged with a lapse of determined time because of its partial damage.",
        "In the various kinds of vehicle, not only axle supporting weight of vehicle but also connective bolt and power transmission are under continuously or repeatedly dynamical or static load. The material having the strength enough to endure the stresses owing to the above various loads is selected and used as the material of these parts. Even such case, it is necessary to do about periodical inspection of whole equipment and exchange of the damageable place.",
        "The understanding of the magnitude and fluctuation of inner stress occurred by applied load gives important information to estimate the fatigue of the concerned material and to study on the improvement of material or the shape. Therefore the strict measurement of stress in these parts have been performed especially by use of ultrasonic waves in most cases, as shown in the patent 5-203513.",
        "In the invention described in the official report Patent No. 5-203513 (the measurement method of the axle stress of bolt by the ultrasonics), measurements of stress both longitudinal and transverse waves are necessary for the concerned material to be measured. Therefore these measurements are always complicated in the preparation of both sensors of longitudinal and transverse waves. Moreover in this patent reference 1, the relation between the sound velocity ratio R and the stress \u03c3 was not disclosed, so it was difficult to apply for industrial use.",
        "The object of this invention is improvement of above non-convenience, especially to offer the real time quantitative stress measurement method and its apparatus for the object to be measured under applied load on the base of sound velocity or time of flight using either longitudinal or transverse waves.",
        "The stress measurement method and its apparatus of this invention are composed to use the value of the change of time of flight measured by propagating sound through the object to be measured. The characteristic of this invention is to calculate the inherent coefficient of the material to be measured (the stress dependent coefficient \u03b1) in advance, then the stresses of the object to be measured is concretely measured at real time on basis of above information.",
        "Each stress measurement method of this invention is concerned to the process of calculation of real time stress occurred in the object to be measured and each of them is basically composed of 4 processes as follows:",
        "In a first process, the time of flight to under non-applied load and nearly non-applied one and the time of flight tn responded the stress \u03c3n induced by the change of applied load are measured through the distance between one face and the another face at the determined place of measured object.",
        "In a 2nd process, the change of time of flight \u0394tn=tn-to (calculated by the plural information about the time of flight to, tn, obtained by above first process. At the same time, the inherent stress dependent coefficient \u03b1 of the measured material is calculated using the conducted formula \u03b1=f (\u0394tn, \u03c3n), and the above obtained information and the elastic modulus of measured object.",
        "In a 3rd process, before or after the 1st and the 2nd process, the time of flight for the distance between one face and another one at the determined place is measured on the object practically installed or constructed under applied unknown load. The practical time of flight t of the equipped object is also measured by the 1st process. The timing of measurement of this procedure is acceptable either before or after the 1st and 2nd process.",
        "In a 4th process, \u0394t (=t-to) is calculated use of the plural information obtained from each process of the 1st to 3rd, and the change of time of flight t of the object, and the stress \u03c3 is calculated by the formula \u03c3=f (\u0394t, \u03b1), then the real applied stress is determined for the practically equipped object.",
        "By use of this invention, time of flight obtained for the object under non-load (1st process), the estimated stress dependent coefficient \u03b1 (2nd process), and the measured practical time of flight (3rd process), are put into the previously determined formula \u03c3=f(\u0394t, \u03b1). As a result, stress \u03c3 induced in the object can be easily and rapidly obtained at the real time. Moreover time calculating \u03b1 becomes shorter by direct use of time of flight to reduce the step of calculating ultrasonic velocity from measured propagating time.",
        "The time of flight to at the non-applied stress and the time of flight tn at the applied stress \u03c3n in the above 1st process can be obtained by using same other part which consists of the same material as the object, or the equipped object under non-applied stress or almost non-stress.",
        "Consequently by using same other part consisted of the same material as the object, the stress dependent coefficient \u03b1 can be rapidly and generally obtained even in the case of the object un-removable from the equipment. In the method measuring the stress dependent coefficient \u03b1 using the object itself, the operative efficiency can be improved because preparing some other parts consisted of the same material as the object is not required though there are some restrictions due to specifying the measurement place in some case.",
        "In the 1st process of the stress measurement method, the ultrasonic wave is made to propagate into parallel direction to applying load to the object. In this case the formula\n\n\u03c3={E/(1\u2212\u03b1)}(\u0394t/to)\n\ncan be used as the formula to calculate the stress \u03c3,. \u03c3=f(\u0394t, \u03b1), where \u0394t=t\u2212to, and t is time of flight of the object under unknown load. By the way mentioned above the unknown stress \u03c3 induced in the object can be concretely estimated from the data of the time of flight.",
        "Moreover in the 2nd stress measurement method, formula\n\n\u03b1={1\u2212(\u0394tn/to)(E/\u03c3n)}\n\ncan be adopted as the formula to obtain the stress dependent coefficient \u03b1 (here n is number of measurements of time of flight, E is the Young's modulus of the object, same script is used below). Thus the inherent stress dependent coefficient \u03b1 of the object can be concretely obtained and unknown stress induced in the object under applied load also rapidly and concretely estimated at real time on the base of measured time of flight.",
        "Moreover in the 1st process of the stress measurement method, the ultrasonic wave is made to propagate into the vertical direction to the applying load to the object. In this case, the formula\n\n\u03b1=\u2212{E/(\u03bd+\u03b1)}\u00b7(\u0394t/to)\n\ncan be used as the formula to calculate the stress \u03c3, \u03c3=f(\u0394t, \u03b1) where \u03bd is the poisson's ratio of the object, the same script is used below. \u0394t=t\u2212to, and t is time of flight of the object under unknown load at the measurement place.",
        "Thus the stress \u03c3 of the object under applied unknown load can be rapidly and quantitatively obtained at real time by use of the measured time of flight. Moreover by making ultrasonic wave propagate vertical to load applying direction in the object the setting place of ultrasonic sensor can be selected from wide range in the measurement of time of flight, so the operation efficiency is expected to improve.",
