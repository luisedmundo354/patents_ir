        "This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/765,549, filed 6 Feb. 2006.",
        "The present invention relates to electrical conductors such as those used to connect a semiconductor package to a load board for electrical testing. Specifically, the invention relates to electrical conductors including a compressive member and a sleeve, the sleeve including deformations to retain the compressive member.",
        "Semiconductor chip manufacturers often perform electrical testing of the semiconductor chips at various stages of production, including final testing prior to shipment. This electrical testing may consist of testing chips in package form, in wafer form, or in individual die form. In package form, the semiconductor chips may be encapsulated in an encapsulating resin, with only conductive balls, pads, or leads exposed outside of the package for electrical contact. In wafer and individual die form, the semiconductor chips may have conductive balls or pads available for electrical contact. Typically, the electrical contacts are arranged into an array. Two common types of contact arrays are land grid array and ball grid array. The electrical testing may consist of electrical functionality tests lasting several minutes or it may consist of burn-in or reliability tests lasting many hours. To maximize the efficiency of the testing process, numerous semiconductor chips may be loaded onto a load board and multiple load boards may be rotated through a single piece of test equipment. This allows some load boards to be populated/de-populated with semiconductor chips while other load boards are in the testing area of the test equipment. The semiconductor chips need to be non-permanently affixed to the load board in such a way that the chips can be easily loaded and unloaded from the board while still ensuring good electrical contact to the load board throughout the potentially lengthy testing process. Typically, an interconnect assembly is used to interface the semiconductor chips to the load board. The actual electrical connections between the semiconductor chip and the load board are usually accomplished by compressible pin-type structures within the interconnect assembly. The compressible pins allow for small variations in the structure of the semiconductor chips while still ensuring good electrical contact between the contact arrays on the chip and the load board. The compressible pin structures, sometimes referred to as \u2018spring pins\u2019 or \u2018pogo pins\u2019 can be quite complicated and expensive, consisting of several discrete components, due to the tight tolerances associated with the interconnect assembly and the high reliability demands of the testing process. As an example, a single compressible pin failure can cause many semiconductor chips to be identified as non-functional before the pin failure is identified. Consequently, an interconnect assembly that includes simpler, more reliable, and less expensive electrical contact components is desired. The invention addresses these and other disadvantages of the conventional art.",
        "The invention is best understood from the following detailed description when read in connection with the accompanying drawing. It is emphasized that, according to common practice, the various features of the drawing are not to scale. On the contrary, the dimensions of the various features are arbitrarily expanded or reduced for clarity.

        "Certain integrated circuit (IC) packages or modules include semiconductor devices, such as chips or dies, contained in an encapsulating material or housing. The IC package or module may include an exterior array of contacts, or input/output pads, for electrically connecting the package or module to another electronic component, such as a load board adapted for use with a package testing system. The contacts of an IC package typically are not connected directly to the load board. Typically, an interconnect assembly (e.g., a test socket) may be interposed between the IC package and the load board to provide electrical connection between the contact array of the IC package and a contact array of the load board.",
        "Referring again to the drawings where like numerals refer to like elements, there is illustrated in FIG. 1, for example, interconnect assembly 100 located between IC package 102 and load board 104 adapted for use with a package testing system. IC package 102 may include an array of electrical contacts 108 located on an exterior surface of package 102. The exemplary array of contacts 108 is of a type known as a \u201cland grid array\u201d in which contacts 108 have substantially planar contact surfaces. Load board 104 also may include an array of electrical contacts 110.",
        "Interconnect assembly 100 may include a plurality of conductors 112 received in openings 116 defined by support frame or carrier 114. As shown, openings 116 of carrier 114 may be spaced to provide for substantial alignment between conductors 112 and contacts 108, 110 of package 102 and load board 104, respectively. Each conductor 112 may be compressible to provide a variable length for conductor 112. Such adjustable conductor length allows interconnect assembly 100 to accommodate dimensional variations, for example amongst contacts 108, 110. Such dimensional variation may result in variation in the separating distance between pairs of contacts 108, 110 when package 102 and load board 104 are brought into contact with interconnect assembly 100 as shown in FIG. 1. The adjustable length for conductors 112 may ensure that each conductor 112 of interconnect assembly 100 will contact package 102 and load board 104.",
        "Each conductor 112 of interconnect assembly 100 may include plunger members 118, 120 defining opposite ends of conductor 112, and cylindrical barrel 122 located between plunger members 118, 120. A coil spring or other resilient member (not shown) may be coupled between plunger members 118, 120 and contained within barrel 122. Compression of the coil spring under loading placed on plunger members 118, 120 may result in the desired shortening of the distance between opposite ends of conductor 112. This type of conductor having elongated plungers, a barrel and a coil spring is sometimes referred to as a \u201cspring pin\u201d or \u201cpogo pin.\u201d",
        "Carrier 114 of interconnect assembly 100 may include socket portion 124 and retainer portion 126 secured together by fasteners at locations 128. Carrier 114 of interconnect assembly 100 may be secured to load board 104 by fasteners at locations 130. Each carrier portion 124, 126 may define respective annular shoulders 132 adjacent openings 116 for retaining barrels 122 of conductors 112 within openings 116. As illustrated in FIG. 1, barrel 122 of each conductor 112 may be dimensioned to define a gap between conductor 112 and annular shoulders 132. This gap may provide vertical play between carrier 114 and barrel 122 of each conductor 112.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2, for example, interconnect assembly 100 of FIG. 1 may be located between load board 104 and IC package 134. Instead of including a land grid array of contacts like package 102, package 134 may include an array of contacts 138 having a rounded configuration. This type of contact array is sometimes referred to as a \u201cball grid array.\u201d",
        "Referring to FIG. 3, for example, there is shown compressible electrical conductor 300 for electrically connecting circuit members (for example, a semiconductor package and a load board). Depicted compressible conductor 300 may include eight discrete wires 302 interlaced with each other, such as by braiding the wires, to form a substantially tubular structure. The interlacing of wires 302 may result in a lattice-like construction in which wires 302 cross each other to define a plurality of openings between the wires. Each interlaced wire 302 of depicted compressible conductor 300 may be deformed during fabrication of the conductor to extend along a helical path. Wires 302, however, may undergo only substantially elastic deformation during manufacture such that plastic deformation may be minimized.",
        "Interlaced wires 302 may then be annealed during manufacture of compressible conductor 300 to provide stress relief, particularly at the locations where adjacent wires 302 overlap each other. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, there may be no bonding or other mechanical interconnection between wires 302, however, such that the wires remain free to move (e.g., slide) with respect to each other when conductor 300 may be compressed under an applied load. The stress relief provided by the annealing may remove associated elastic strain within wires 302, such that the wires will tend to remain together in the unitary, tubular, construction shown rather than springing apart when a length of the interlaced-wire construction may be cut to provide individual conductors, such as conductor 300 of FIG. 3, for example, of desired length.",
        "The tubular construction of depicted compressible conductor 300 desirably may provide a simplified construction compared to the spring pin or pogo pin having opposite plunger members, an intermediate barrel and a coil spring coupled between the plunger members and contained within the barrel. Also, the tubular construction of depicted compressible conductor 300 may provide a universal construction in which compression can occur along the entire length of the conductor. This differs from the pogo pin construction having substantially rigid plunger members in which compression may be concentrated to the intermediately located spring member contained within the barrel. The construction and properties of electrical conductor 300 is described in greater detail in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/736,280, filed Dec. 15, 2003, which claims priority of U.S. provisional applications No. 60/457,076, filed Mar. 24, 2003, No. 60/457,258, filed Mar. 25, 2003, and No. 60/462,143, filed Apr. 8, 2003, each incorporated by reference in its entirety. It should be understood that the present invention is not limited to depicted compressible conductor 300. Alternative constructions are conceived, such as interlaced-wire tubes including more, or fewer, than eight wires 302 and conductors made from flat meshes of interlaced wire that may be rolled into a tubular form. Further, the teachings of the present invention are applicable to other types of compressible conductors such as conductive springs or the like.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4, according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, interconnect assembly 400 is illustrated electrically connecting two circuit members 402, 404. According to one non-limiting example, circuit members 402, 404 may be, respectively, semiconductor package 402 and load board 404 adapted for use with a package testing system.

It should be understood that the present invention is not limited to use with circuit members having electrical contacts of any particular configuration. The arrays of electrical contacts of circuit members 402, 404, for example, may comprise a land grid array (e.g., the array of electrical contacts 108 of package 102 illustrated in FIG. 1), a ball grid array (e.g., the array of electrical contacts 138 of package 134 illustrated in FIG. 2), or arrays of electrical contacts having other configurations.",

The spaced arrangement of conductors 410, 460, 490 may substantially correspond to the spaced arrangement for electrical contacts 406, 408, respectively, of circuit members 402, 404. This arrangement provides for contact between conductors 410, 460, 490 and contact arrays 406, 408 of circuit members 402, 404, as illustrated in FIG. 4, for example. It is noted that first, second and third electrical conductors 410, 460, 490 illustrated in FIG. 4 may each be according to a separate exemplary embodiment of the present invention and are illustrated on the same interconnect assembly 400 for convenience and while is it contemplated that different embodied electrical conductors may be assembled in a single such interconnect assembly 400, only one type exemplary embodiment conductor may comprise each conductor 410, 460, 490. Interconnect assembly 400 specifically illustrated in FIG. 4, for example, has only three conductors 410, 460, 490 spaced across carrier 442 to facilitate description. It should be understood, however, that an interconnect assembly according to the invention may include an arrangement of conductors that includes few conductors or, alternatively, up to tens of thousands of conductors or more.

Respective apertures 448, 449 of socket member 444 and retainer 446 are substantially aligned, axially, with each other. As illustrated in FIG. 4, for example, apertures 448 of socket member 444 of carrier 442 have a diameter that may be larger than an outer diameter of compressible members 412, and larger than an outer diameter of sleeves 451, 461, 491 of respective conductors 410, 460, 490, such that annular gaps are defined between conductors 410, 460, 490 and apertures 448 of socket member 444.
