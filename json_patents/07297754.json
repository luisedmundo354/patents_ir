        "This invention relates to a method for preparing an aromatic chloroformate useful in the preparation of polycarbonates and co-polycarbonates. More particularly the method relates to a method for preparing an aromatic chloroformate in a flow reactor.",
        "Aromatic alcohols may be phosgenated in both batch processes and continuous processes to provide aromatic chloroformates. Despite extensive research and development efforts directed towards the more efficient manufacture of aromatic chloroformates, deficiencies remain.",
        "It is of interest therefore, to develop new and more efficient processes for the formation of aromatic chloroformates.",
        "The present invention provides a method for the preparation of aromatic chloroformates. The method comprises introducing into a flow reactor at least one aromatic hydroxyl compound, phosgene, at least one solvent, and an organic base to form a unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture, said unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture being substantially free of water; and maintaining said unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture at a temperature in a range between about 0\u00b0 C. and about 60\u00b0 C. to produce a product stream comprising an aromatic chloroformate.",
        "In another aspect the present invention provides a method for preparing a co-polycarbonate. The method comprises reacting a dihydroxy aromatic compound under interfacial conditions with phosgene and an aromatic chloroformate. The aromatic chloroformate is prepared by a method comprising introducing into a flow reactor at least one aromatic hydroxyl compound, phosgene, at least one solvent, and an organic base to form a unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture, said unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture being substantially free of water; and maintaining said unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture at a temperature in a range between about 0\u00b0 C. and about 60\u00b0 C. to produce a product stream comprising an aromatic chloroformate.",
        "The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention and the examples included therein. In the following specification and the claims which follow, reference will be made to a number of terms which shall be defined to have the following meanings:",
        "The singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.",
        "The modifier \u201cabout\u201d used in connection with a quantity is inclusive of the stated value and has the meaning dictated by the context (e.g., includes the degree of error associated with measurement of the particular quantity).",
        "The term \u201caromatic hydroxyl compound\u201d as used herein refers to an organic species comprising at least one hydroxyl group attached to an aromatic carbon atom, wherein the aromatic hydroxyl compound is free from aliphatic hydroxyl groups. Phenol, hydroquinone, beta-naphthol; 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene; and 3-hydroxypyridine illustrate aromatic hydroxyl compounds. Conversely, organic species which do not comprise a hydroxyl group attached to an aromatic carbon atom are not ranked among aromatic hydroxyl compounds. A hydroxyl group attached to a non-aromatic carbon atom is referred to herein as an \u201caliphatic hydroxyl group\u201d. Methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, cyclohexanol, sucrose, dextrose, benzyl alcohol, and cholesterol illustrate compounds comprising aliphatic hydroxyl groups. However, compounds comprising hydroxyl groups attached to the aromatic group and also containing non-aromatic carbons, for example 2,6-dimethylphenol, fall within the group defined by the term aromatic hydroxyl compounds.",
        "As used herein, the term \u201caromatic radical\u201d refers to an array of atoms having a valence of at least one comprising at least one aromatic group.

The aromatic radical may also include nonaromatic components. For example, a benzyl group is an aromatic radical which comprises a phenyl ring (the aromatic group) and a methylene group (the nonaromatic component). Similarly a tetrahydronaphthyl radical is an aromatic radical comprising an aromatic group (C6H3) fused to a nonaromatic component \u2014(CH2)4\u2014. For convenience, the term \u201caromatic radical\u201d is defined herein to encompass a wide range of functional groups such as alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, alkynyl groups, haloalkyl groups, haloaromatic groups, conjugated dienyl groups, alcohol groups, ether groups, aldehydes groups, ketone groups, carboxylic acid groups, acyl groups (for example carboxylic acid derivatives such as esters and amides), amine groups, nitro groups, and the like.

The aromatic radical 1-imidazolyl (C3H2N2\u2014) represents a C3 aromatic radical. The benzyl radical (C7H7\u2014) represents a C7 aromatic radical.",
        "As used herein the term \u201ccycloaliphatic radical\u201d refers to a radical having a valence of at least one, and comprising an array of atoms which is cyclic but which is not aromatic. As defined herein a \u201ccycloaliphatic radical\u201d does not contain an aromatic group. A \u201ccycloaliphatic radical\u201d may comprise one or more noncyclic components. For example, a cyclohexylmethyl group (C6H11CH2\u2014) is an cycloaliphatic radical which comprises a cyclohexyl ring (the array of atoms which is cyclic but which is not aromatic) and a methylene group (the noncyclic component). The cycloaliphatic radical may include heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, selenium, silicon and oxygen, or may be composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. For convenience, the term \u201ccycloaliphatic radical\u201d is defined herein to encompass a wide range of functional groups such as alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, alkynyl groups, haloalkyl groups, conjugated dienyl groups, alcohol groups, ether groups, aldehyde groups, ketone groups, carboxylic acid groups, acyl groups (for example carboxylic acid derivatives such as esters and amides), amine groups, nitro groups, and the like.

By way of further example, a C1-C10 aliphatic radical contains at least one but no more than 10 carbon atoms. A methyl group (i.e., CH3\u2014) is an example of a C1 aliphatic radical. A decyl group (i.e., CH3(CH2)9\u2014) is an example of a C10 aliphatic radical.",

For example, 2,6-di-t-butylphenol comprises a single hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, and both positions on the aromatic ring adjacent to the hydroxyl group are substituted by a tertiary aliphatic radical, the t-butyl radical. Under such conditions, the hydroxyl group of 2,6-di-t-butylphenol is said to be flanked on each side by a tertiary aliphatic radical, the t-butyl radical. The compound, 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenol, 3,5-di-t-butylphenol and 2-t-butyl-6-isopropylphenol are examples of aromatic hydroxyl compounds which do not fall with the scope of an \u201caromatic hydroxyl compound comprising only hydroxyl groups flanked on each side by tertiary aliphatic and/or tertiary cycloaliphatic radicals\u201d.",

The method includes introducing at least one aromatic hydroxyl compound, phosgene and a solvent into a flow reactor to form a unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture wherein the aromatic hydroxy compound is free of aliphatic hydroxyl groups. An organic base is also introduced into the flow reactor. In one embodiment of the present invention, the unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture is substantially free of water. The term \u201csubstantially free of water\u201d is defined as containing less than 2% percent by weight of water based on the weight of the reaction mixture comprising aromatic hydroxyl compound, phosgene and a solvent. When the reaction mixture is not substantially free of water, it is believed that the water may compete with the hydroxyl groups of the aromatic hydroxyl compound for phosgene. When the hydroxyl groups of the aromatic hydroxyl compound react with phosgene product chloroformates result, together with by-product hydrochloric acid. However, when water reacts with phosgene the products are carbon dioxide and hydrochloric acid. The presence of water in the unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture may be thus undesirable because phosgene is consumed without the production of the desired chloroformate product.",
        "Aromatic chloroformates which may be prepared according to the present invention include monochloroformates and polychloroformates.

        "As noted, the method of the present invention comprises introducing into a flow reactor at least one aromatic hydroxyl compound, phosgene, a solvent, and at least one organic base to form a unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture in which a product aromatic chloroformate is formed. For convenience, the aromatic hydroxyl compound, phosgene, and the organic base are collectively referred to as \u201cthe reactants\u201d. The reactants and solvent are typically introduced continuously into the flow reactor to produce a flowing reaction mixture. Continuous introduction of the reactants and solvent is not required, however. In one embodiment, the introduction of one or more of the aromatic hydroxyl compounds, phosgene, a solvent, and an organic base is carried out in a non-continuous manner. For example, the phosgene may be introduced in a series of discrete pulses with a time interval between each individual introduction of phosgene. The time intervals may be regular time intervals (i.e. be time intervals of equal duration), irregular time intervals, or a combination thereof.",
        "The rates of addition of one or more of the reactants and solvent may be controlled by feedback provided by one or more sensors located within the flow reactor or in the product stream after it emerges from the flow reactor. For example, an excursion in the reactor effluent chloroformate concentration may trigger a change in the rate of addition of one or more of the reactants, for example the organic base.",
        "The flow reactor used for carrying out the chloroformylation reaction is typically a tube having a front end into which the reactants and solvent are introduced, and a back end from which a product stream emerges from the reactor, but is not limited to tube reactors or tubular reactors. Many types of flow reactors are known and can be used in the practice of the present invention. For the purpose of describing the instant invention, a flow reactor is defined as a reactor which can be operated such that at least one reactant is added to the reactor while simultaneously removing at least one product from the reactor. For example the flow reactor may be a multi-channel flow reactor having a plurality of channels through which the flowing reaction mixture passes. In one embodiment, the flow reactor is continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). In another embodiment, the flow reactor is a tubular reactor configured with a continuous stirred tank reactor such that the output from the CTSR serves as the input for the tubular reactor. In one embodiment, the flow reactor comprises a single channel having a rectangular-shaped cross section.",
        "Within the flow reactor, a unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture is produced. Although mixing elements may be present within the flow reactor, the unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture flows essentially in one direction, i.e. from the front end of the reactor to the back end of the reactor. This condition is sometimes also referred to as \u201cco-current flow\u201d. A unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture characterized by co-current flow is typically formed by introducing reactants and solvent into an upstream portion of a flow reactor and removing at a position downstream a product stream containing all of the unreacted reactants, solvent, products, and by-products. The flow reactor may be equipped with a single inlet at the front end of the reactor for the introduction of reactants and solvent. Alternatively, the reactor may comprise a plurality of inlets for the introduction of reactants and solvents. As the unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture passes through the flow reactor, the reactants are converted to products and by-products. Typically, the product is the aromatic chloroformate and the by-product hydrochloric acid. The by-product hydrochloric acid is converted to the hydrochloride salt in presence of the organic base. The unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture in which a substantial portion of the reactants have been converted to product and by-product is referred to as the product stream. The flow reactor has at least one reactor outlet through which the product stream emerges from the reactor. Alternatively, the flow reactor may comprise a plurality of reactor outlets. The product stream exits from the reactor outlet or outlets. Typically, no vent or waste streams different from the product stream exit any separate reactor outlet\u2014only the product stream exits, albeit possibly at multiple reactor outlets. The term, \u201csingle product stream\u201d means that the entire product stream comprising all of the unreacted reactants (i.e. unreacted starting materials), products, by-products and solvent emerges from the reactor through a single reactor outlet. As a consequence, the entire mass of the reactants and solvent is conserved within the single product stream emerging from the flow reactor.",
        "Alternatively, the flow reactor used may comprise a plurality of reactor outlets through which the product stream emerges. For example, in one embodiment the flow reactor is a tubular reactor of length \u201cL\u201d measured from the front end of the reactor to the back end of the reactor, said tubular reactor having two reactor outlets, a first reactor outlet located a distance \u201cL/2\u201d from the front end of the reactor, and a second reactor outlet located a distance \u201cL\u201d from the front end of the reactor. Reactants and solvent are introduced through three separate inlets at the front end of the reactor. The rates of addition of reactants and solvent and the reactor temperature may be controlled such that the product stream emerging at the first reactor outlet is characterized by a percent conversion of reactants to products of about 50 percent, and that the product stream emerging from the second reactor outlet is characterized by a percent conversion of reactants to products of about 100 percent. Each of the two product streams exiting the tubular flow reactor at positions \u201cL/2\u201d and \u201cL\u201d respectively contains all of the unreacted reactants, (i.e. unreacted starting materials), products, by-products and solvent present in the product stream at positions \u201cL/2\u201d and \u201cL\u201d within the flow reactor. It should be noted as well that the sum of the masses of the two product streams emerging at positions \u201cL/2\u201d and \u201cL\u201d is equal to the mass of reactants and solvents introduced into the tubular reactor. Thus, the entire mass of the reactants and solvent is conserved within the two streams emerging at various points along the flow reactor.",
        "It should be further noted that the temperature in various sections of the reactor may be the same or different. For example, in the tubular reactor system just described the temperature of the flowing reaction mixture at first reactor outlet located a distance \u201cL/2\u201d from the front end of the reactor may be 25\u00b0 C. while at the second reactor outlet located a distance \u201cL\u201d from the front end of the reactor the temperature of the flowing reaction mixture is 54\u00b0 C. In addition, the flow reactor may be uniformly or nonuniformly heated or uniformly or nonuniformly cooled. Alternatively, the reaction may be carried out under adiabatic conditions.",
        "Where multiple product streams are produced by a flow reactor according to the present invention it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that each of the product streams may be used for a different purpose; as for example in the tubular reactor system just described the product stream emerging at the first reactor outlet located a distance \u201cL/2\u201d from the front end of the reactor may be directed to a polymerization reactor and used in the preparation of a co-polycarbonate, while at the product stream emerging at the second reactor outlet located a distance \u201cL\u201d from the front end of the reactor may be used to provide a purified chloroformate.",
        "As noted, the flow reactor is not particularly limited and may be any reactor system, which provides for the \u201cupstream\u201d introduction of the reactants and the \u201cdownstream\u201d removal of the product stream comprising the aromatic chloroformate, the solvent, the hydrochloride salt of the organic base, and any unreacted reactants. The flow reactor may comprise a series of flow reactor components, as for example, a series of continuous flow reactors arrayed such that the effluent from a first flow reactor provides the input for a second flow reactor and so forth. The reactants may be introduced into the flow reactor system through one or more feed inlets attached to the flow reactor system. Typically, it is preferred that the reactants and solvent be introduced into the flow reactor through at least three feed inlets. For example, as in the case where a solution of the aromatic hydroxyl compound in an organic solvent such as methylene chloride, organic base, and phosgene are introduced through separate feed inlets at or near the upstream end of a flow reactor. Alternatively, the feed solution may comprise a mixture of aromatic hydroxyl compound, solvent and the base, while phosgene is fed in separately. Alternative arrangements wherein one or more of the reactants is introduced through multiple feed inlets at various points along the flow reactor are also possible. Typically, the relative amounts of the reactants and solvent present in the flow reactor are controlled by the rate at which they are introduced. For example, a reactant can be introduced into the flow reactor through pumps calibrated to deliver a particular number of moles of said reactant per unit time.",
        "In one embodiment the present invention provides a method for preparing a co-polycarbonate. The method comprises reacting a dihydroxy aromatic compound under interfacial conditions with phosgene and an aromatic chloroformate. The term \u201cinterfacial conditions\u201d is meant to describe the conditions typically used to prepare polycarbonates commercially, namely conditions under which a mixture comprising the salt of a dihydroxy aromatic compound, base, water and a water immiscible solvent are reacted in a two phase reaction mixture with phosgene to afford polycarbonate. Thus in one embodiment, an aromatic chloroformate prepared by the method of the present invention is reacted under interfacial conditions with a dihydroxy aromatic compound and phosgene to afford a co-polycarbonate. Typically, the interfacial polymerization is carried out at a temperature between about 25\u00b0 C. and about 40\u00b0 C. at atmospheric pressure under relatively high pH conditions of 8-14, preferably pH 10-14. Generally an acid scavenger is employed which neutralizes the hydrogen chloride formed during the interfacial reaction. Typically the acid scavenger used is an aqueous base, for example, an alkali metal hydroxide. Non-limiting examples of alkali metal hydroxides include sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. In a preferred embodiment the alkali metal hydroxide is sodium hydroxide. A catalyst is employed to promote the interfacial reaction and high yields are generally obtained. Typically, catalysts that may be employed herein are preferably amine catalysts. In one particular embodiment the catalyst is triethylamine (TEA). As noted, the aromatic chloroformate is prepared by the method of the present invention wherein at least one aromatic hydroxyl compound, phosgene, a solvent, and an organic base are introduced into a flow reactor to form a unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture. The unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture is in particular embodiments substantially free of water and is maintained at a temperature in a range between about 0\u00b0 C. and about 60\u00b0 C. to produce a product stream comprising an aromatic chloroformate and by-product HCl or the hydrochloride salt of the organic base. In a preferred embodiment unidirectionally flowing reaction mixture is substantially free of water and the temperature is maintained in a range between about 10\u00b0 C. and about 50\u00b0 C.",

The batch reactor used was a 2-liter agitated batch reaction vessel equipped with a pH electrode, a dip tube, a tube for addition of 50 wt percent sodium hydroxide solution and a reflux condenser. The batch reactor was initially maintained at room temperature. A dual 6-blade turbine impeller operated at 450 revolutions per minute was used as the agitator. The flow reactor employed typically comprised a series of two 316SS Ko-Flo\u00ae static mixers (\u215c\u2033 o.d.\u00d711\u2033 long) which were insulated. The output of the flow reactor was connected to the diptube of the batch reactor. The 2-liter batch reactor was charged with 140 grams bisphenol A, 650 milliliters methylene chloride, and 425 milliliters H2O. Phosgene (12.1 grams) was introduced at the rate of 3.0 grams/minute through the flow reactor connected to the dip tube of the batch reactor. After the addition of phosgene (12.1 g), a feed solution (112.3 g) comprising 3.0 wt percent 2,6-dimethyl phenol and 2.48 wt percent triethylamine in methylene chloride was introduced into the flow reactor at a rate of 30.8 g/min, while continuing the addition of phosgene into the flow reactor. The product stream emerging from the flow reactor was introduced into the batch reactor via the dip tube. The pH in the batch reactor was maintained at about 10.5 by addition of 50 wt. percent sodium hydroxide. After the addition of the feed solution, a methylene chloride flush stream was introduced into the flow reactor at about 30 g/min for 2 minutes while continuing the flow of phosgene through the flow reactor and into the batch reactor. The addition of the phosgene stream continued uninterrupted through the flow reactor until 74.4 gm phosgene was added to the batch reactor. After the addition of phosgene was completed, 0.25 gm/min nitrogen was purged through the phosgene feed line and tube reactor and into the batch reactor, and the reaction was agitated for 15 minutes. The reaction product was then quenched with 1N HCl, washed three times with deionized water, and then analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). 1H-NMR showed excellent incorporation of the 2,6-dimethylphenol as endgroups of the product polycarbonate.

Phosgene (74.5 g) was added directly to the batch reactor at the rate of 3 g/min via the dip tube. After 12.1 gm phosgene was added, a feed solution (112.3 g) consisting of 3 wt. percent 2,6-dimethylphenol and 2.48 weight percent triethylamine in methylene chloride was added to the batch reactor at the rate of 30.8 grams per minute. Addition of phosgene was continued during the addition of the feed solution. The pH of the reactor was maintained at about 10.5 by the addition of 50 wt. percent aqueous sodium hydroxide. After the addition of phosgene was completed, 0.25 gm/min nitrogen was purged through the phosgene feed line and the batch reactor, and the reaction was agitated for 15 minutes.
