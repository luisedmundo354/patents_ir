    "abstract": "The invention discloses a signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) measurement method. The method measures interference power (I) of a single-path signal after the received signal is demodulated by the single-path demodulators of multipath receiving device at the receiving end. The total interference power is obtained by equipartition combining with the measured interference power of each single-path signal. The signal power (S) is obtained by measuring after maximum ratio combination of each single-path signal. The SIR of the received signal is the division of the signal power and the total interference power. An apparatus, implementing mentioned method, sets the interference power measurement-device in the RAKE combiner and the signal power measurement-device after the RAKE combiner. In this way, the interference measurement can effectively provide more information and can more really response to the channel variation.",

        "The present invention relates generally to CDMA mobile communication technology, and more particularly to a method and apparatus of measuring signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) at receiving end.",
        "SIR measurement is an important technology in a CDMA mobile communication system, and is mainly used in power control, soft hand-over and cells search etc. The SIR measurement provides real time and effective signal-to-interference ratio information for normal operation of a system. Performance of a mobile communication system is directly affected by measurement accuracy of the SIR. Conventional SIR measurement can refer to article \u201cSIR-Based Transmit Power Control of Reverse Link for Coherent DS-CDMA Mobile Radio\u201d (IEICE TRANS. COMMUN. VOL. E81-B, NO. 7 JULY 1998). With reference to FIG. 1, the SIR measurement procedure can be summarized as following:",
        "1) After passing through RAKE combiner 1 of the RAKE receiver, a transmitted multipath signal is formed a single-path signal.",
        "2) The combined RAKE signal is sent, on the one hand, to the signal power measurement-device 2 for signal power estimate, and on the other hand, to the interference power measurement-device 3 for interference power estimate. The formulas for estimate can refer to the above document.",
        "3) The output of the signal power measurement-device 2 and interference power measurement-device 3 is divided by the divider 4 to obtain the SIR measurement value.",
        "The conventional SIR measurement method measures SIR with the single-path signal after RAKE combining at receiving end. Nevertheless, the signal is transmitted with multipath and is received by multipath receiving technology at receiving end. Therefore, the interference measurement is unrealistic and part of the interference result is lost. Moreover, since a channel of the mobile communication system is a Rayleigh-fading channel; when the channel is at heavy fading depth, the conventional SIR measurement method cannot really reflect channel variation and cannot provide to the system accuracy and effective information.",
        "The invention proposes a SIR measurement method and apparatus for the same. The method and the apparatus can more effectively provide information of an interference measurement, and can make a SIR measurement more accurate.",
        "The invention is a measurement method of signal-to-interference ratio for CDMA mobile communication system. A signal is demodulated by the single-path demodulators in the RAKE combiner of the receiving end. After that, an interference power (I) of a single-path signal is measured. The measured interference power of every single-path signal is sent to an equipartition combiner to form a total interference power. Diversity combination of every single-path signal is measured to obtain the signal power (S). By dividing the measured signal power with the total interference power, the signal-to-interference ratio is obtained.",
        "In the technical scheme, mentioned above, said total interference power obtained by equipartition combination can be further processed with smoothing filter to make the interference power and the signal-to-interference ratio more accurate.",
        "Said interference power measurement of a single-path signal, after having been demodulated by a single-path demodulator at the receiving end, is made in every path, respectively. Said diversity combination can be maximum ratio combination or equivalence gain combination.",
        "The invention provides a signal-to-interference ratio measurement apparatus implementing the method, mentioned above. The apparatus at least includes a RAKE combiner, a signal power measurement-device, interference power measurement-devices and a divider.",
        "The RAKE combiner includes multiple single-path demodulators and a diversity combiner. All single-path signals outputted from the single-path demodulators are made diversity combination of multipath signal in the diversity combiner to form a single signal, which is used for signal power measurement in the signal power measurement-device.",
        "The interference power measurement-devices are multiple devices set in the RAKE combiner. An input of every interference power measurement-device is connected to the output of the single-path demodulator, respectively. All interference power outputs measured by every interference power measurement-device are sent to an equipartition combiner for equipartition combination. The output of the equipartition combiner and the output of the signal power measurement-device are sent to the divider for division operation to obtain a signal-to-interference ratio.",
        "The technical scheme mentioned above can further include a smoothing filter. The smoothing filter input is connected to the equipartition combiner output. The output of the equipartition combiner is further made smooth processing. The output of the smoothing filter and the output of the signal power measurement-device are sent to the divider to make a division operation to obtain the signal-to-interference ratio.",
        "Said multiple interference power measurement-devices and multiple single-path demodulators are correspondingly connected one by one, i.e., the output of each single-path demodulator is connected to an interference power measurement-device. Said diversity combiner can be a maximum ratio combiner or an equivalent gain combiner.",
        "The invention separates the measurement of a signal power (S) and the interference power (I). This means that S is measured after combining in the RAKE combiner and I of every path is measured before combining and a total I is formed by equipartition combination. In this way, a SIR is measured.",
        "Since the invention measures interference power I at every path in the RAKE combiner, so the interference measurement can effectively obtain more information. Therefore, SIR value measured by the invention method is more accurate than by the conventional method.",
        "In addition, when the invention is used in a power control system, all the original power control module will not be updated, so all the advantages of the conventional power control are remained.",

        "The technical scheme, mentioned above, of the invention has been used in a WCDMA (wideband CDMA) for SIR measurement of inner-loop power control. In the down link, the pilot symbol number Npilot is set to 4, the multipath number n is set to 2, and the Block Error Ratio (BLER) of received signal is kept at 0.01. In the RAKE combiner module, each path of the two paths is measured with formula (1). Then, the total interference power I is obtained by taking average of the measured results with formula (2). The signal power S is obtained by measuring the data signal after RAKE combining. The ratio of the signal power and interference power is the SIR measured value for inner-loop power. Con-paring the SIR measured value and the SIR threshold-value obtained by outer-loop power control, a power control command is obtained. In this way, the power control of down link is performed.",
