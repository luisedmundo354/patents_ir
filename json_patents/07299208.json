        "This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/117,715 entitled \u201cApparatus and System for Providing Automated Spread Trading Transaction Information\u201d and filed concurrently herewith.",
        "A portion of the disclosure of the patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.",
        "The present invention relates to spread trading. In particular, the present invention relates to an apparatus and system for defining an automated spread trading parameter.",
        "According to certain types of investment strategies, a trader simultaneously (or nearly simultaneously) purchases and sells associated investment instruments, such as stocks or bonds. In particular, the trader attempts to take advantage of a difference, or \u201cspread,\u201d between the prices of the associated instruments. For example, a trader might note that: (i) a first instrument can currently be purchased in a first market for $8.25, and (ii) a second instrument\u2014which is expected to be priced the same as the first instrument\u2014can currently be sold in a second market for $8.27. In this case, the trader would simultaneously purchase the first instrument and sell the second instrument to take advantage of the $0.02 price difference.",
        "There are a number of different types of spread trading strategies. For example, arbitrage trading is associated with differences in price when the same security, currency, or commodity is traded on two or more markets. As another example, index arbitrage trading exploits price differences between stock index futures and underlying stocks.",
        "As still another example, risk arbitrage trading involves a purchase of stock in a company being acquired, referred to as a \u201ctarget,\u201d and a sale of stock in a proposed \u201cacquirer\u201d (e.g., a trader may attempt to profit on an expected rise in the price of the target's shares and drop in the price of the acquirer's shares).",
        "In general, the size of investments that are purchased and sold during spreading trading can be significant (e.g., because the price discrepancies tend to be relatively small). Moreover, spread trading investment strategies are time sensitive (e.g., markets can be expected to quickly correct any price discrepancies). As a result, it may not be practical for a trader to manually monitor investments and place orders based on his or her observations. Instead, a trader establishes a number of trading parameters (e.g., a price difference at which orders should be generated) and have an automated system monitor investments and generate orders as appropriate.",
        "For example, a trader might place a telephone call to an operator associated with an automated trading platform. The trader asks to have the platform monitor particular investments and generate orders based on trading parameters he or she verbally provides to the operator. Such an approach, however, may be inefficient for the trader (as well as for the trading platform), especially if the trader frequently adjusts the trading parameters (e.g., based on market conditions). Moreover, such an approach may lead to mistakes (e.g., the operator may incorrectly enter one or more parameters into the trading platform system).",
        "As another approach, a trader might install a hard-wired computer communication channel to the automated trading platform (e.g., by leasing a dedicated access T1 line). A dedicated communication channel, however, can be expensive to install and maintain. As a result, this approach may not be feasible for traders who perform a only a limited amount of spread trading. In addition, the automated trading platform will only be able to accommodate a limited number of traders (e.g., based on a maximum number of dedicated lines that can be received by the platform).",
        "To alleviate problems inherent in the prior art, the present invention introduces an apparatus and system for defining an automated spread trading parameter.",
        "According to one embodiment, a processor is coupled to a communication device adapted to communicate with a trader device via a temporary computer communication channel. A storage device in communication with the processor stores instructions adapted to be executed by the processor to (i) receive from the trader device a trading parameter for a pair of associated investments and (ii) store the received trading parameter for use by an automated spread trading system.",
        "According to another embodiment, a trading parameter for a pair of associated investments is received from a trader device via a temporary computer communication channel. The received trading parameter is then stored for use by an automated spread trading system.",
        "According to another embodiment, a trading parameter for a pair of associated investments is received from a trader device via a communication channel potentially accessible by a plurality of unrelated trader devices. The received trading parameter is then stored for use by an automated spread trading system.",
        "According to another embodiment, a trading parameter for a pair of associated investments is received via a public computer communication network. The received trading parameter is then stored for use by an automated spread trading system.",
        "According to still another embodiment, a trader identifier is received via a Web site and verified. The following information is then received via the Web site: an acquirer stock identifier, a target stock identifier, a selected risk arbitrage trading strategy, and an authorization to automatically generate orders in accordance with the strategy. The received information is then stored for use by an automated spread trading system.",
        "According to yet another embodiment, a temporary computer communication channel is established with an automated spread trading system. A trading parameter for a pair of associated investments is then transmitted via the communication channel.",
        "One embodiment comprises: means for receiving from a trader device a trading parameter for a pair of associated investments, the receiving being performed via a temporary computer communication channel; and means for storing the received trading parameter for use by an automated spread trading system.",
        "Another embodiment comprises: means for receiving from a trader device a trading parameter for a pair of associated investments, the receiving being performed via a communication channel potentially accessible by a plurality of unrelated trader devices; and means for storing the received trading parameters for use by an automated spread trading system.",

        "Still another embodiment comprises: means for receiving a trader identifier via a Web site; means for verifying the trader identifier; means for receiving via the Web site an acquirer stock identifier, a target stock identifier, a selected risk arbitrage trading strategy, and an authorization to automatically generate orders in accordance with the strategy; and means for storing the received information for use by an automated spread trading system.",
        "Yet another embodiment comprises: means for establishing a temporary computer communication channel with an automated spread trading system; and means for transmitting via the communication channel a trading parameter for a pair of associated investments.",

        "The automated spread trading system 600, the trader devices 10, and the order processing system 30 may comprise any devices capable of performing the various functions described herein. For example, a trader device 10 may be a Personal Computer (PC) associated with a \u201ctrader.\u201d As used herein, the term \u201ctrader\u201d may refer to, for example, an individual or other entity that buys and sells investments (e.g., securities, stocks, bonds, options, or commodities). A trader device 10 may also comprise a portable computing device such as a laptop computer, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a wired or wireless telephone, or any other appropriate storage and/or communication device.",
        "The automated spread trading system 600 may be, for example, a Web server adapted to exchange information with trader devices 10 and/or the order processing system 30. As used herein, devices (e.g., the automated spread trading system 600 and the trader devices 10) may communicate, for example, via a communication network 20, such as an Internet Protocol (IP) network (e.g., the Internet). Note that the communication network 20 can also include a number of different networks, such as an intranet, a Local Area Network (LAN), a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), a proprietary network, a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), and/or a wireless network.",
        "According to some embodiments of the present invention, the automated spread trading system 600 communicates with the trader device 10 via a temporary computer communication channel (e.g., a path through which information can be exchanged). In other words, the communication channel between the automated spread trading system 600 and a trader device 10 may be established and discontinued as appropriate. Note that an established communication channel does not need to be associated with a particular physical path. For example, the automated spread trading system 600 may exchange information with a trader device 10 via a Web site, in which case packets of information may be transmitted via various physical paths.",
        "According to other embodiments, the automated spread trading system 600 communicates with the trader device 10 via a public computer communication network. That is, at least a portion of the communication network may be accessed by devices other than the automated trading system 600 and the trader device 10. Note, however, that the information exchanged between the automated trading system 600 and the trader device 10 could be encrypted or otherwise protected to prevent a third party from accessing (i.e., understanding) the information.",
        "According to still other embodiments, the automated spread trading system 600 communicates with the trader device 10 via a computer communication channel that is potentially accessible by a plurality of unrelated trader devices 10. For example, a single port or line associated with the automated spread trading system 600 might communicate with a first trader device 10 for a period of time and then with a second, unrelated trader device 10 (i.e., the first and second trader devices 10 may be associated with different traders or clients).",
        "Although a single automated spread trading system 600 is shown in FIG. 1, any number of these devices may be included in the trading environment 100. Similarly, any number of trader devices 10, order processing systems 30, or any other device described herein may be included in the trading environment 100 according to embodiments of the present invention.",
        "The order processing system 30 may be, for example, a trade platform that arranges for orders to be executed based on information received from the automated spread trading system 600. For example, the order processing system 30 may arrange for buy and sell orders to be executed via a market center or public exchange (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange). The order processing system 30 may be associated with, for example, a Web server or third-party order processing service.",
        "Note that some of devices illustrated in FIG. 1 may actually be incorporated in a single device. For example, the automated spread trading system 600 may also act as an order processing system 30.",
        "According to an embodiment of the present invention, the automated spread trading system 600 receives from a trader device 10 one or more trading parameters for a pair of associated investments. For example, the automated spread trading system 600 might receive stock identifiers associated with an acquirer and a target (e.g., \u201cGE\u201d and \u201cHON\u201d). The automated spread trading system 600 might also receive an indication of a trading strategy (e.g., associated with a particular risk arbitrage trading strategy). The automated spread trading system 600 may then store the received trading parameters.",
        "FIG. 2 is a block diagram overview of the automated spread trading system 600 according to some embodiments of the present invention. As can be seen, the automated spread trading system 600 includes a deal dictionary tool 602 (e.g., an investment pair setup tool). The deal dictionary tool 602 may comprise, for example, an application or engine that exchanges information with a trader device 10. The deal dictionary tool 602 helps a trader set up one or more deals (e.g., each deal being associated with a pair of investments). In particular, the deal dictionary tool 602 may let the trader establish trading parameters for the deal. Note that some or all of the functions described with respect to the deal dictionary tool 602 may instead be performed at a trader device 10.",
        "According to one embodiment, a trader selects one or more trading strategies associated with a risk arbitrage deal. For example, a trader might select limits, distribution, dollar-to-dollar, share-to-share, and/or order-for-order trading strategies. According to another embodiment, the trader selects a strategy for a deal associated with fixed income investments (e.g., government, corporate, or municipal bonds). For example, the trader might define a spread between two treasury investments (e.g., treasury bills, notes, or bonds) at which buy and sell orders should be automatically generated. According to another embodiment, the trader selects a strategy associated with two baskets of investment instruments (e.g., two mutual funds) that are somehow statistically related.",
        "In the case of a risk arbitrage deal, the trading parameters defined via the deal dictionary tool 602 might include information about a potential acquirer, such as a stock name, a dividend amount, a sell action (e.g., \u201csell long only,\u201d \u201csell short only\u201d or a \u201cmixed\u201d sell action indicating that the action type should be determined by an actual position share number in an account), and/or an indication that orders should only be generated in \u201cround lots\u201d (i.e., generally accepted units of trading). Other information may indicate whether the automated spread trading system 600 should initiate orders of a target stock. Similar information about a potential target may also be defined via the deal dictionary tool 602.",
        "Other trading parameters for the deal might include a ratio value (e.g., a value indicating a share converting ratio), a spread ration (e.g., a dollar spread discussed below), a cash value (e.g., a value indicating a converting cash amount), a cash balance, a hedge type (e.g., options of hedge for dollar and hedge for share), and a hedge ratio (e.g., which may default to a spread ration for dollar hedge but not for share hedge). Similarly, the trader may define a maximum position, such as a maximum target position share amount that will limit the trader's stake in the deal. The trader may also define a percent per tick value reflecting a percent of maximum target position shares per \u201ctick\u201d (e.g., an upward or downward price movement) to be applied on pair initiate orders.",
        "According to some embodiments, the trading parameters may include a setup limit (e.g., a sell spread limit dollar or percentage amount) and a setup position, such as a maximum setup target position associated with selling an acquirer investment and purchasing a target investment (e.g., a dollar value for a dollar hedge or a share value for a share hedge). Similarly, the trading parameters may include a setup position per order (e.g., an initiating order share number or dollar value depending on the associated hedge type).",
        "Moreover, the trading parameters might include an unwind limit (e.g., a buy spread limit dollar or percentage amount) and an unwind position, such as a maximum unwind target position associated with selling a target investment and purchasing an acquirer investment (e.g., a dollar value for a dollar hedge or a share value for a share hedge). Similarly, the trading parameters may include an unwind position per order (e.g., an initiating order share number or dollar value depending on the associated hedge type).",
        "The deal dictionary tool 602 may also be used to establish a quote range (e.g., in dollars), an order time interval (e.g., a time constraint between consecutive orders that are initiated), and/or a sell short constraint which may be applicable for trading strategies that allow both sell and buy initiate orders (e.g., dollar-to-dollar limits).",
        "Moreover, the deal dictionary tool 602 may be used to define a strategy (e.g., a limit or distribution strategy), a spread type (e.g., a dollar, yield, or yield close spread type), a cancel/replace increment (e.g., when the limit price of an initiate order moves above a dollar amount the automated spread trading system 600 may send a cancel/replace order with a new limit price), a liquidity constraint (e.g., in terms of percentage of current open size of other side), a short tick allowance (e.g., adjustment of spread limits for setup and unwind if the price type of balance order is sell short), a balance buy type (e.g., price type of balance buy order), a balance sell type (e.g., a price type of balance sell order), a buy offset (e.g., an adjustment of limit price of balance buy order), a sell offset (e.g., an adjustment of limit price of balance sell order), a balance order unit, and/or a balance order multiplier.",
        "In the case of a dollar spread, an upper limit (e.g. a sell spread limit in dollars) and a lower limit (e.g., a buy spread limit in dollars) may be defined. For example, a \u201cbid spread\u201d may be defined as:\n\nspread-BB=(Abid\u2212Adiv)*ratio+cash\u2212(Tbid\u2212Tdiv)\n\nwhere Abid is associated with an acquirer bid, Adiv is associated with an acquirer dividend, Tbid is associated with a target bid, and Tdiv is associated with a target dividend. Similarly, an \u201cask spread\u201d may be defined as:\n\nspread-AA=(Aask\u2212Adiv)*ratio+cash\u2212(Task\u2212Tdiv)\n\nMoreover, a \u201cbid-ask spread\u201d and an \u201cask-bid spread\u201d may be defined as, respectively:\n\nspread-BA=(Abid\u2212Adiv)*ratio+cash\u2212(Task\u2212Tdiv)\n\nspread-AB=(Aask\u2212Adiv)*ratio+cash\u2212(Tbid\u2212Tdiv)\n\nand a \u201clast spread\u201d may be defined as:\n\nspread-LL=(Alast\u2212Adiv)*ratio+cash\u2212(Tlast\u2014Tdiv)",
        "In the case of a yield spread, these values may instead be defined as follows:\n\nspread-BB=(Abid/Tbid)*100\n\nspread-AA=(Aask/Task)*100\n\nspread-BA=(Abid/Task)*100\n\nspread-AB=(Aask/Tbid)*100\n\nspread-LL=(Alast/Tlast)*100",
        "In the case of a yield close spread, the values may be defined as:\n\nspread-BB=((Abid/Aclose)\u2212(Tbid/Tclose))*100\n\nspread-AA=((Aask/Aclose)\u2212(Task/Tclose))*100\n\nspread-BA=((Abid/Aclose)\u2212(Task/Tclose))*100\n\nspread-AB=((Aask/Aclose)\u2212(Tbid/Tclose))*100\n\nspread-LL=((Alast/Aclose)\u2212(Tlast/Tclose))*100",
        "The automated spread trading system 600 also includes an automated trading strategy component 604. The automated trading strategy component 604 may comprise, for example, one or more agents that use trading parameters associated with a deal and market information to determine if buy and/or sell orders should be automatically generated. That is, following a trading strategy selected by the trader, the automated trading strategy component 604 may control the initial order process and manage existing open orders. Note that the automated trading strategy component 604 may receive market data and trading information (e.g., associated with open orders and positions) in substantially real-time and process the data to issue subsequent orders based on trading parameters. The order messages may then be transmitted to the order processing system 30 for eventual execution.",
        "In the case of a limits trading strategy, sell orders may be triggered when pre-determined offer prices (e.g., calculated using spread limits and ask prices of the opposite side in the deal) are above, at, or lower than the current ask price as appropriate. In particular, the pre-determined offer prices for selling the acquirer stock and selling the target stock may be defined as, respectively:\n\nAoffer=((Task\u2212Tdiv)+Upper Limit\u2212cash)/ratio and\n\nToffer=(Aask\u2212Tdiv)*ratio+cash\u2212Lower Limit.",
        "Note that the calculated prices may be rounded-off as desired. When Aoffer is less than or equal to (Aask+Quote Range) or Boffer is less than or equal to (Task+Quote Range), a sell order is generated by the automated trading strategy component 604. Note that ambiguous sale decisions could result if the separation between spread limits is defined as less than 2*Quote Range.",
        "According to one embodiment, the automated trading strategy component 604 generates a \u201ccancel\u201d request (e.g., indicating that an outstanding order should be cancelled) when the selling condition described above fails. Moreover, when the Aoffer/Toffer price moves away from the last order price, a \u201ccancel and replace\u201d order may be generated to take advantage of the new price.",
        "According to some embodiments of the present invention, the current position balance is monitored. When a sell order on one side is partially filled, the automated trading strategy component 604 can then place a market buy order for a corresponding amount on the opposite side.",
        "The number of shares for each sell order may be set, for example, as the lesser of (i) a trader-defined percentage of a maximum position and (ii) a percentage (e.g., a liquidate constraint) of a current ask size for the balance side.",
        "According to some embodiments, the automated trading strategy component 604 imposes a time delay: (i) between two orders on the same investment instrument and/or (ii) between a balancing order and a subsequent initiating order. By way of example, the time delay could be twenty four seconds or another value defined by a trader via the deal dictionary tool 602.",
        "Consider now a \u201cdistribution\u201d trading strategy to be used when a trader wants to maintain positions at different spreads for a particular deal.

Since the spread is currently between 1.5 and 2.0, the target position is \u201c0\u201d shares.",
        "When the current ask-spread moves above 2.0, the desired position now becomes \u201c\u22121,000.\u201d The automated trading strategy component 604 sells spread (i.e., sells AOL shares and buys TWX shares) until the desired position is reached (i.e., \u201c\u22121,000\u201d shares).",
        "When the current ask-spread moves back below 2.0, the desired position again becomes \u201c0.\u201d The automated trading strategy component 604 buys spread (i.e., sells TWX shares and buys AOL shares) until the desired position is reached (i.e., \u201c0\u201d shares).",
        "Referring again to FIG. 2, the automated spread trading system 600 also includes a system risk control tool 606. The system risk control tool 606 may, for example, let a trader, a client, and/or an operator associated with the automated spread trading system 600 establish various trading activity constraints. For example, the system risk control tool 606 might halt trading for a specific deal or an entire account when a constraint is exceeded. Similarly, an order might only be generated when time, size, dollar, liquidity, and/or system availability parameters are met.",
        "The constraint parameters monitored by the system risk control tool 606 may include, for example, a maximum share amount or dollar position for each deal, a maximum open order share amount or dollar amount for each deal, and/or a maximum number of open orders for each deal. Similarly, the system risk control tool 606 might monitor these parameters on an account basis (e.g., reflecting a number of different deals). As another example, the system risk control tool 606 might ensure that a limit order price is within a predetermined range of a current market price.",
        "According to one embodiment, a risk parameters is automatically determined based on trader information. For example, all traders associated with a particular client may be assigned a particular risk parameter (e.g., a $10,000 trading limit). According to another embodiment, a system operator provides the risk parameter which is then stored for use by the system risk control tool 606.",
        "According to another embodiment, the system risk control tool 600 also verifies system information. For example, if a component crashes or improper messages are detected, the system risk control tool 606 could automatically halt trading for investments that might be associated with the problem.",

In particular, the display 400 comprises a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that a trader can use to define stock pairs and other trading parameters for a risk arbitrage deal. The display 400 may be generated by, for example, a JAVA\u2122 applet transmitted from the automated spread trading system 600 to the trader device 10. According to another embodiment, the trader instead defines one or more trading parameters by exporting or otherwise providing information from another application (e.g., a MICROSOFT EXCEL\u00ae spreadsheet).",
        "As can be seen in FIG. 4, the trading parameter defined via the display 400 can include one or more investment identifiers (e.g., stock identifies associated with the acquirer and the target). According to some embodiments, the trader may also define a deal identifier (e.g., \u201cGE_HON\u201d not shown in FIG. 4). The information may also include a service and/or an exchange associated with the deal (e.g., \u201cNYX\u201d and \u201cNYSE,\u201d respectively).",
        "For each of the acquirer and target investments, the trader may further define a dividend value, a sell action (e.g., \u201cmixed\u201d), a round lot indication (e.g., indicating that orders should only be generated for round lots, and/or an order initiation indication. Other trading parameters that may be established via the display 400 include a lower limit, an upper limit, a ratio, and/or a cash value.",
        "The trader may also define a trading strategy associated with the pair of investments, such as a follow spread strategy, a distribution strategy, a dollar-to-dollar strategy, a share-to-share strategy, and/or an order-for-order strategy.",
        "As can be seen in FIG. 4, the display 400 may also be used to establish one or more of the following trading parameters: a Minimum Price Variation (MPV), a maximum position, a percent per tick, a liquidate constraint, a quote range, a time interval, a sell short constraint, a balance buy type, a balance sell type, an over balance multiple, a per spread above bid, a per spread below offer, and/or an over balance spread.",
        "The trader may also activate areas on the display to indicate that the deal should executed, reset (e.g., returned to default values), deleted, or dismissed.",
        "FIG. 5 illustrates a deals display 500 according to some embodiments of the present invention. In particular, the display 500 is providing information about a single risk arbitration deal (i.e., having an identifier of \u201cGE_HON\u201d). Note that the deals display 500 could provide information about a number of different deals defined by a trader.",
        "For each deal, the deals display indicates whether or not orders are being automatically generated (i.e., as indicated by a check mark). The trader may activate this area to select and de-select this indication to authorize the automatic generation of orders in accordance with the strategy he or she selected via the deal dictionary tool 602. According to one embodiment, the automated spread trading system 600 automatically cancels any outstanding orders associated with a deal when this indication is deselected.",
        "For each deal, the deal display 500 displays a target and acquirer asking price, a lower limit, an ask spread, a target bid, and an acquirer bid. Moreover, other information about each deal could be displayed. For example, for each deal some or all of the following information might be provided: a target bid, an acquirer bid, a last target value, and a last acquirer value.",
        "The lower portion of the display 500 may provide information about all orders (e.g., including orders that have been executed), open orders, or rejected orders as selected by the trader. In particular, for each order the following information is provided: an account identifier, a stock symbol, the side of the order (e.g., buy or sell), the number of shares associated with the order, a price associated with the order (e.g., a limit price and average price), and a time associated with the order (e.g., the time the order was created and the time the transaction was executed). Moreover, other information about each order could be displayed, such as: an order dollar amount, an order lot size, a number of shares that have been filled, and/or a number of shares that remain open. The trader may also select to clear the order portion of the display 500.",
        "The information on the deals display 500 may be updated in substantially real time (e.g., once every second). Note that different portions of the deals display 500 may be updated at different rates. Moreover, the deals display 500 might provide information on an account, a trader, a client, and/or a system basis.",
        "In addition to the trading parameters described with respect to FIGS. 4 and 5, other information could be defined for a deal (e.g., via the deal dictionary tool 602), such as: a date, a time (e.g., indicating that orders should be automatically generated until 2:00 PM), a duration (e.g., indicating that orders should be automatically generated for the next three hours), start information, and/or end information (e.g., a trigger that will halt the automatic generation of orders). According to another embodiment, the trader may define an alternate communication address independent of the temporary computer communication channel. For example, the trader might provide a telephone number or an electronic mail address that should be used to contact the trader when a defined trigger is satisfied.",
        "At 304, the received trading parameter is stored for use by the automated spread trading system 600. For example, the automated spread trading system 600 may locally store the trading parameter in a database. The trading parameter may be stored in association with, for example, a particular trader, a client associated with a plurality of traders, and/or one of a plurality of accounts associated with a trader. Note that the trading parameter may still be stored after the temporary computer communication channel is discontinued. For example, a set of trading parameters might be stored even after a trader leaves a Web site. In this way, orders can be automatically generated when the trader is not currently in communication with the automated spread trading system 600.",
