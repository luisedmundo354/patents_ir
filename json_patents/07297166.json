No., 10/606,304 entitled \u201cNON-LINEAR REAMER FOR BONE PREPARATION AND ASSOCIATED METHOD\u201d filed concurrently herewith which are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "The present invention relates generally to the field of orthopaedics, and more particularly, to an implant for use in arthroplasty.",
        "Patients who suffer from the pain and immobility caused by osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis have an option of joint replacement surgery. Joint replacement surgery is quite common and enables many individuals to function properly when it would not be otherwise possible to do so. Artificial joints are usually comprised of metal, ceramic and/or plastic components that are fixed to existing bone.",
        "Such joint replacement surgery is otherwise known as joint arthroplasty. Joint arthroplasty is a well-known surgical procedure by which a diseased and/or damaged joint is replaced with a prosthetic joint. In a typical total joint arthroplasty, the ends or distal portions of the bones adjacent to the joint are resected or a portion of the distal part of the bone is removed and the artificial joint is secured thereto.",
        "There are known to exist many designs and methods for manufacturing implantable articles, such as bone prostheses. Such bone prostheses include components of artificial joints such as elbows, hips, knees and shoulders.",
        "During performance of a joint replacement procedure, it is generally necessary to provide the surgeon with a certain degree of flexibility in the selection of a prosthesis. In particular, the anatomy of the bone into which the prosthesis is to be implanted may vary somewhat from patient to patient. Such variations may be due to, for example, the patient's age, size and gender. For example, in the case of a femoral prosthesis, the patient's femur may be relatively long or relatively short thereby requiring use of a femoral prosthesis which includes a stem that is relatively long or short, respectively. Moreover, in certain cases, such as when use of a relatively long stem length is required, the stem must also be bowed in order to conform to the anatomy of the patient's femoral canal.",
        "Such a need for prostheses of varying shapes and sizes thus creates a number of problems in regard to the use of a one-piece prosthesis. For example, a hospital or surgery center must maintain a relatively large inventory of prostheses in order to have the requisite mix of prostheses needed for certain situations, such as trauma situations and revision surgery. Moreover, since the bow of the stem must conform to the bow of the intramedullary canal of the patient's femur rotational positioning of the upper portion of the prosthesis is limited thereby rendering precise location of the upper portion and hence the head of the prosthesis very difficult. In addition, since corresponding bones of the left and right side of a patient's anatomy (e.g. left and right femur) may bow in opposite directions, it is necessary to provide (left) and (right) variations of the prosthesis in order to provide anteversion of the bone stem, thereby further increasing the inventory of prostheses which must be maintained.",
        "As a result of these and other drawbacks, a number of modular prostheses have been designed. As its name implies, a modular prosthesis is constructed in modular form so that the individual elements or figures of the prosthesis can be selected to fit the needs of a given patient's anatomy. For example, modular prostheses have been designed which include a proximal neck component which can be assembled to any one of numerous distal stem components in order to create an assembly which fits the needs of a given patient's anatomy. Such a design allows the distal stem component to be selected and thereafter implanted in the patient's bone in a position which conforms to the patient's anatomy while also allowing for a limited degree of independent positioning of the proximal neck component relative to the patient's pelvis.",
        "One issue that arises as a result of the use of a modular prosthesis is the locking of the components relative to one another. In particular, firm reproducible locking of the proximal neck component to the distal stem component is critical to prevent separation of the two components subsequent to implantation thereof into the patient. The need for the firm locking is particularly necessary if the design does not provide for positive locking with weight bearing. As such, a number of locking mechanisms have heretofore been designed to lock the components of a modular prosthesis to one another. For example, a number of modular prostheses have heretofore been designed to include a distal stem component which has an upwardly extending post which is received into a bore defined distal neck component. A relatively long fastener such as a screw or bolt is utilized to secure the post with the bore. Other methods of securing modular components include the impacting of one component onto the other. This method has highly variable results.",
        "Current designs of modular stems include designs in which the modular connection utilizes a tapered fit between the two components. For example, the proximal body may include an internal taper which mates with an external taper on the distal stem. Such a taper connection may be used in conjunction with additional securing means, for example, a threaded connection or may be used alone. It is important that the tapered connection be secure. For example, the proper amount of force must be applied to the tapered connection to properly secure the tapered connection so that the connection can withstand the forces associated with the operation of the stem.",
        "Current attempts to provide a device to adjoin components of a modular joint prosthesis are fraught with several problems. For example, the device may not provide sufficient mechanical advantage to securely lock the components. Further, the ergonomics available to lock the components may not be optimal. Further, a device relying solely on the displacement for a taper connection may not provide sufficient force as there may not be an accurate correspondence of displacement to the clamping force. Further, utilizing a displacement method may make it possible to overtighten and damage the components. Further, prior art solutions may be difficult to manufacture or expensive to make. Further prior art devices may be unsuitable for disconnecting the components. There is thus a need to provide for a assembly and disassembly tool capable of alleviating at least some of the aforementioned problems.",
        "U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/327,187 entitled \u201cADJUSTABLE BIOMECHANICAL TEMPLATING & RESECTION INSTRUMENT AND ASSOCIATED METHOD\u201d, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/327,196 entitled \u201cALIGNMENT DEVICE FOR MODULAR IMPLANTS AND METHOD\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/327,527 entitled \u201cINSTRUMENT AND ASSOCIATED METHOD OF TRIALING FOR MODULAR HIP STEMS\u201d are hereby incorporated in their entireties by reference.",
        "According to the present invention, a device is provided for two components of a modular joint prosthesis. The device is particularly well-suited for assembling the proximal stem component to the distal stem component of a modular prosthetic joint stem, such as one for a hip prosthesis. The instrument has a portion that engages, for example, the proximal component and another component that engages the distal component. The instrument applies force on the proximal component and an opposing force on the distal component. For example, the instrument may threadably engage the proximal aspect of the distal stem and apply an opposing force on the proximal shoulder of the proximal body.",
        "The first component of the instrument is caused to rotate with respect to the second component of the instrument. A handle is rotated about the central axis that conveys rotary motion into axial displacement. The axial displacement serves to thereby lock and unlock the taper joining the distal component to the proximal component. The instrument may be designed to yield a specific axial displacement, which is previously determined based upon the specific taper geometry of the implant.",
        "In an embodiment of the present invention, a coupling device threadably engages with the proximal aspect of the distal stem. A counterface contacts the proximal aspect or shoulder of the proximal body in order to provide opposing forces which axially displace the two components relative to each other, thus locking and unlocking the tapered connection. The instrument may be actuated by rotating one handle with respect to the body or another handle. The handle may, for example, travel in a slot, angled relative to the axis of the cylinder, thereby providing axial motion. In other embodiments of the present invention, a standard thread and bolt connection between the first component and the second component provide for the axial motion.",
        "According to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an assembly tool for assembly of a first component of a prosthesis to a second component of the prosthesis for use in joint arthroplasty. The tool includes a first member operably associated with the first component. The first member defines a first member longitudinal axis of the first member. The tool also includes a second member operably associated with the second component. The second member defines a second member longitudinal axis of the second member. The second member is adapted to provide relative motion of the second member with respect to the first member when the second member is rotated relative to the first member about the second member longitudinal axis.",
        "According to another embodiment of the present invention there is provided an assembly tool for assembly of a first component of a prosthesis to a second component of the prosthesis for use in joint arthroplasty. The tool includes a first member operably associated with the first component. The first member defines a first member longitudinal axis of the first member. The first member includes a first member relative motion feature and a body defining a generally cylindrical longitudinal opening in the body. The tool also includes a second member operably associated with the second component. The second member has a portion of the second member matingly fitted to the cylindrical longitudinal opening of the first member. The second member defines a second member longitudinal axis of the second member. The second member is adapted to provide relative motion of the second member with respect to the first member along the longitudinal axis of the second member when the second member is rotated relative to the first member about the second member longitudinal axis. The second member includes a second member relative motion feature. The first member relative motion feature and the second member relative motion feature cooperate with each other to provide the relative motion of the first member with respect to the second member. The relative motion of the second member with respect to the first member corresponds to the relative motion of the first component with respect to the second component to urge the second component into engagement with the first component.",
        "According to another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a kit for use in joint arthroplasty. The kit includes an implant for implantation at least partially in the medullary canal of a long bone. The implant has a first component and a second component removably attachable to the first component. The kit also includes an assembly tool including a first member operably associated with the first component. The first member defines a first member longitudinal axis of the first member and a second member operably associated with the second component. The second member defines a second member longitudinal axis of the second member. The second member is adapted to provide relative motion of the second member with respect to the first member when the second member is rotated relative to the first member about the second member longitudinal axis.",
        "According to a further embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method for providing joint arthroplasty. The method includes the steps of providing a prosthesis including a first component and a second component removably attachable to the first component, providing a instrument having a first member and a second member rotatably moveable with respect to the first member in a plane perpendicular with the first member, the first member cooperable with the first component and the second member cooperable with the second component, assembling the first component to the second component, connecting the first member of the tool to the first component, connecting the second member of the tool to the second component, and rotating the first member of the tool with respect to the second member of the tool to secure the first component to the second component.",
        "The technical advantages of the present invention include the ability of the device to provide sufficient mechanical advantage to properly secure the components to form a secured joint. For example, according to one aspect of the present invention, the first component is joined to the second component by a threaded connection. By changing the pitch of the threadable connection, the mechanical advantage can be increased to provide for a sufficient mechanical advantage.",
        "For example, according to yet another aspect of the present invention, the first component and the second component have outwardly extending handles. The handles may have any suitable length and may be made longer to provide for additional mechanical advantage. Thus the present invention provides for sufficient mechanical advantage to properly secure the prosthesis.",
        "Another technical advantage of the present invention is the ability of the device to provide for optimum ergonomics. For example, according to one aspect of the present invention, the device is held and actuated by opposed extending handles which may be easily gripped by the surgeon and rotated relative to each other to secure the joint. Thus, the present invention provides for simple optimum ergonomics.",
        "Yet another technical advantage of the present invention includes the ability of the device to provide for a measurement of forces in addition to the measurement of displacement. Due to frictional forces and additional complications, displacements of the device do not always directly lineally correspond to the forces that may be applied by the device. Therefore, there is an advantage to be able to measure the force applied by the device in addition to the displacement of the device. For example, according to another aspect of the present invention, a handle of the device may include a torque measuring feature which may be used to measure the torque applied to the device. Alternatively or in addition thereto, the device may include a force washer or other force transducers along the axial body of the instrument in order that the forces applied may be directly measured.",
        "Another technical advantage of the present invention includes the ability of the device to limit the displacement of the instrument and therefore to limit the force applied to the prosthesis. If excessive force is applied to the prosthesis it is possible to overtighten and damage the component. For example, according to one aspect of the present invention, the displacement is physically limited by a helical opening of limited length or by a limited amount of threaded engagement between the two components. It is also possible to provide for a device with a break-away torque limiter that limits the amount of torque that the device may apply. Thus, the present invention provides for an ability to avoid overtightening of the prosthesis components.",
        "Another technical advantage of the present invention is its simple and inexpensive design. For example, according to one aspect of the present invention, the device includes a cylindrical tube and a rod which slidably fits within the cylindrical tube. The tube and rod are threadably connected so that when one component is rotated with respect to the other one, the one component moves axially relative to the other one providing for a simple, inexpensive way of utilizing a device to disassemble or assemble a component.",
        "An additional advantage of the present invention includes the ability of the device to be utilized simply and easily to disconnect as well as to connect the components of a modular prosthesis. For example, according to one aspect of the present invention, a component may be placed onto the assembly device to provide for connecting features to disassemble the device. Thus, the present invention provides for a simple and quick way of being utilized to disassemble as well as to assemble a prosthesis.",
        "Other technical advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions and claims.",

        "Embodiments of the present invention and the advantages thereof are best understood by referring to the following descriptions and drawings, wherein like numerals are used for like and corresponding parts of the drawings.",
        "According to the present invention and referring now to FIG. 1, assembly tool 1 according to the present invention is shown. The assembly tool 1 is used for assembly of a first component 2 of a prosthesis 4 to a second component 6 of the prosthesis 4 for use in joint arthroplasty. The tool 1 includes a first member 8 operably associated with the second component 6. The first member 8 defines a first member longitudinal axis 10 of the first member 8. The tool 1 also includes a second member 12 operably associated with the second component 6. The second member 12 defines a second member longitudinal axis 14 of the second member 12. The second member 12 is adapted to provide relative motion of the second member 12 with respect to the first member 8 when the second member 12 is rotated relative to the first member 8 about the second member longitudinal axis 14.",
        "The assembly tool 1 is suited for use with the prosthesis 4 when, for example, the prosthesis 4 includes the first component 2 and the second component 6 which are engaged and disengaged by relative motions along an axis. For example, the assembly tool 1 is suitable when the prosthesis 4 includes components which are connected by a tapered connection. For example, as shown in FIG. 1, the first component 2 includes an internal taper 16 that mates with an external taper 18 located on the second component 6.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1, the first component 2 is engaged with the second component 6 when the first component 2 moves in the direction of arrow 20 and/or when the second component 6 moves in the direction of arrow 22. As shown in FIG. 1, the first member 8 is operably associated with the first component 2 while the second member 12 is operably associated with the second component 6. To provide for the operable association of the components, it should be appreciated that the first member 8 includes a first member operating feature 24 which is operably associated with a first component operating feature 26 of the first component 2. Similarly, the second member includes a second member operating feature 28 which cooperates with a second component operating feature 30 of the second component 6.",
        "For simplicity, since the first member 8 and the first component 2 are merely required to prevent motion of the two components toward each other, the first member 8 and the first component 2 may be designed such that the first member operating feature 24 may be in the form of a bottom and/or surface. Similarly, the first component operating feature 26 may be in the form of a top surface of the first component 2.",
        "The second member operating feature 28 and the second component operating feature 30 may be any features capable of urging the second component 6 upwardly in the direction of arrow 22. For example, for simplicity, the second member operating feature 28 may be in the form of internal threads formed on the second component operating feature 26, which may mate with external threads 30 formed on the second component 6.",
        "The first member 8 and the second member 12 may have any shape or configuration capable of providing relative motion along first member longitudinal axis 10 and second member longitudinal axis 14. For example, and as shown in FIG. 1, the first member 8 may be in the form of a hollow component or tube. Similarly, the second member 12 may be in the form of a rod or cylinder which may slidably fit within the first member 8. As shown in FIG. 1, the first member 8 may include a longitudinal opening 32.",
        "In order to move the second component 6 into engagement with the first component 2, it should be appreciated that the second member 12 must move in the direction of arrow 34 with respect to the first member 8. In order to provide relative motion between the second member 12 and the first member 8, as shown in FIG. 1, the second member 12 may include a rod portion 36 having a cylindrical periphery 38 thereof. The first member 8 may, as shown in FIG. 1, include a cylindrical tubular portion 40 that defines the opening 32 therein. The rod periphery 38 of the second member 12 defines an outside diameter OD which is matingly fitted with dimension ID of the opening 32 of the tubular portion 40.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1, the relative motion of the first member 8 with respect to the second member 12 may be controlled by, for example, a relative motion feature 42. As shown in FIG. 1, the relative motion feature 42 may be in the form of a threaded connection. The threaded connection 42 may, for example, as shown in FIG. 1, include a first member relative motion feature 44 in the form, of for, example internal threads. The internal threads 44 are formed on internal periphery 46 of the tubular portion 40 of the first member 8.",
        "The relative motion feature 42 may also include a second member relative motion feature 48. Second member relative motion feature 48 may be in the form of, for example, external threads formed on rod portion 36 of the second member 12. The threads 44 and 48 cooperate to provide the relative motion of the second member 12 in the direction of arrow 34 with respect to the first member 8. The threads 44 and 48 are matingly engaged and have a pitch selected to provide for the desired mechanical advantage.",
        "Preferably and as shown in FIG. 1, the amount of relative motion of the first member 8 with respect to the second member 12 is limited. Such a limited relative motion of the first member 8 with respect to the second member 12 correspondingly limits the motion of the first component with respect to the second component 6 thus preventing over-tightening of the prosthesis 4. The motion of the first member 8 with respect to the second member 12 may be accomplished in any suitable fashion. For example, the external threads 48 may have a thread length LE which is slightly greater than the thread length LI of the internal threads 44 of the first member 8. Thus, the motion in the direction of arrows 34 and 38 of the component 12 with respect to component 8 is limited by the difference of the thread lengths LE and LI. It should be appreciated that the threads 44 and 46 may only limit the motion of the members 8 and 12 if the major diameters of the threads 44 and 48 provide interference with the first member 8 or the second member 12. It should be appreciated that stops (not shown) may be utilized to limit the relative motion of the first member 8 with respect to the second member 12. A cap 52 and a collar 54, both secured to first meter 8 and both shown in phantom, may be utilized to limit the relative motion of the first member 8 with respect to the second member 12.",
        "It should be appreciated that in order to move the second member 12 in the direction of arrow 34 with respect to the first member 8, the second member 12 must be rotated in the direction of arrow 56 with respect to first member 8. This motion assembles the components 2 and 6. Similarly, it should be appreciated that in order for the second member 12 to move in the direction of arrow 39 with respect to the first member 8, the second member 12 must be rotated in the direction of arrow 60 with respect to the first member 8. This motion disassembles the components 2 and 6.",
        "To provide the sufficient torque or mechanical advantage for rotating the second member 12 in the direction of arrow 56 and 60, it should be appreciated that the second member 12 may include a second member handle 62 extending outwardly from the rod portion 36 of the second member 12. Similarly, it should be appreciated that to resist the force applied by the second member handle 62, the first member 8 may similarly include a first member handle 64 extending outwardly from the tubular portion 40 of the first member 8. The handles 62 and 64 may have any suitable size and shape capable of receiving for example the hands of the surgeon or operator of the assembly tool 1.",
        "It should be appreciated that the assembly tool 1 may likewise be utilized to disassemble the first component 2 from the second component 6. It should be appreciated that the assembly tool 1 may be adapted for use for the disassembly of the first component 2 from the second component 6. It should be appreciated that one of the first member 8 and the second member 12 may be associated with one of the first component 2 and the second component 6 such that as the first member 8 is moved relative to the second member 12, the first component 2 may be disassembled from the second component 6. To accomplish this, one of the first member 8 and the second member 12 is operably associated with the first component 2 while the other of the first member 8 and the second member 12 is operably associated with the second component 6.",

The first member 8 is similarly operably associated with the first component 2.",
        "In order that the second component 6 may be forced to move in the direction of arrow 63 while the first component 2 is required to move in the direction of arrow 65, the first component 2 must be restrained by the first member 8. The first component 2 is held against the first member 8 by, for example, a third member 66.",
        "The third member 66 cooperates with the first member 8 and the first component 2 to hold the two components against each other. The third member 66 may cooperate with the first member 8 and the first component 2 in any suitable fashion. For example, the first member 8 may include a first member disassembly operating feature 68 which cooperates with the third member 66. Similarly, the first component 2 may include a first component disassembly operating feature 70 which cooperates with the third member 66.",
        "The third member 66 may have any suitable design or shape and may, for example, be in the form of first fork 72 and second fork 74.

The assembly tool 1 is positioned with respect to the prosthesis 4 such that the internal threads 28 of the second member 12 engage the external threads 30 of the second component 6. The internal threads 28 and the external threads 30 are threaded into engagement with each other and the second member 12 is rotated with respect to the second component 6 until the bottom end surface 24 of the first member 8 is in contact with the top surface 26 of the first component 2. At this point, the second member handle 62 is rotated in the direction of arrow 56 until the second member handle has come to the stop created by the relative motion feature 42.",
        "When utilizing the assembly tool 1 to disassemble the first component 2 from the second component 6 the third member 66 is utilized and placed in position on the assembly tool 1. The forks 72 and 74 of the third member 66 are placed in position in the first member grooves 68 and the first component grooves 70. The top surface 26 of the first component 2 is thus in contact with the bottom end surface 24 of the first member 8. The second component 6 is then threadably engaged into the second member 12. The second member handle 62 is then rotated in the direction of arrow 60 until the relative motion feature 42 ends the movement of the second member handle 62 thereby disassembling the first component 2 from the second component 6.",
