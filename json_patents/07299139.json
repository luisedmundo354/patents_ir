        "Various embodiments may relate generally to measuring accuracy, and particular embodiments may relate to methods and systems for measuring accuracy of gas meters and volume correctors.",
        "Fluids, such as natural gas, may be transported, distributed, and sold to end-users through distribution systems. For example, a gas-fired furnace of an apartment complex may receive natural gas through a gas line. The gas consumption by end users varies over time. For residential users, for example, demand may typically decrease during summer, and increase through the winter.",
        "To measure the amount of gas consumed by a user, a gas meter may be installed on the gas line. One type of gas meter is a rotary gas meter. Gas flowing through the meter to the end-user appliance causes an impeller to rotate. Each rotation of the impeller corresponds to a certain amount of gas passing through the meter, the precise amount being dependent on factors such as the line pressure, flow rate, temperature, etc. As such, rotation of the impeller may be monitored to determine the amount of gas that is passing through the meter and being consumed by the customer.",
        "Gas is typically sold by price per volume, e.g., dollars per 1000 cubic feet. Accurate gas billing, as well as other functions, may depend largely on accurate gas metering. To refine their accuracy, some meters have volume correctors to adjust the output of the gas meter to produce a more accurate measurement. Much like a gear, a volume corrector may adjust the output of a meter by, for example, a fixed ratio, such as 1003:1000. As another example, a volume corrector may adjust a gas meter output by +/\u22120.07%, depending on the particular meter and its installation.",
        "Where volume correctors are used, functions such as billing may rely on the combined accuracy of both the meter and the volume corrector. The accuracy of a gas meter alone can be checked using a transfer prover. The accuracy of a volume corrector can be separately checked by a dedicated measuring device.",
        "Systems and associated apparatus, methods, and computer program products, relate to measuring the combined accuracy of a gas meter and a volume corrector as a system. The measurement is performed with a transfer prover, and may be performed automatically on either integrated or non-integrated volume correctors and meters. In one embodiment, a test interface provides a convenient connection with controllable data switches for routing information between the meter/volume corrector, the transfer prover, and a processing device. Software running on the processing device can automatically configure the parameters for performing a combined accuracy test by downloading parameters from the meter/corrector and transfer prover via the test interface. Upon user selection of the test type, and optionally flow rates, for running the test, the software may configure data switches on the test interface to automatically perform the selected combined accuracy test.",
        "Some embodiments may provide one or more advantages. For example, accuracy testing of the combined meter and volume corrector can lead to a single, accurate test of the entire metering system. Automated parameter determination for a selected test type may reduce labor, requirements for specialized user training, and avoid manual computation errors. Some embodiments may be configured to perform a test that minimizes test time substantially, in some cases from one or two hours down to between about 30 to 60 seconds. As such, some embodiments may yield time savings, including reduced off-line time for meter testing, and/or labor and opportunity cost savings, while decreasing opportunities for test configuration errors and improving accuracy for the combined meter and volume corrector measurement system.",

        "FIG. 1A shows an exemplary test setup 100 for determining the accuracy of an integrated gas meter and corrector in a laboratory environment. The setup 100 includes an integrated gas meter and corrector 102 configured for testing to determine if the integrated meter/corrector 102, combined as a whole, accurately measures the volume of a gas that is passed through a line 104. In the test setup 100, a gas, such as air, flows through the line 104. A transfer prover 106 drives the test air flow along the line 104 using a blower. The transfer prover 106 also provides a reference volume measurement that may be compared to the measurement from the meter/corrector 102 to determine the accuracy of the meter/corrector 102.",
        "In this example, some or all of the steps of the test may be performed under the control and/or monitoring of a computer device 108, such a portable (e.g., handheld, laptop, etc . . . ) computer in some embodiments. The computer device 108 is in communication with a test interface 110. The test interface 110 routes control and data signals between the computer device 108 and the meter/corrector 102. In addition, the test interface 110 routes data signals from the meter/corrector 102 to the transfer prover 106.",
        "In this example, the meter/corrector 102 includes a volume sensor 112, a temperature sensor 114, a pressure sensor 116, and communication interfaces 118A-B. In some implementations, the meter/corrector 102 includes a processing unit 120. The meter/corrector 102 measures the volume of air flowing through the line 104 using the volume sensor 112. The flow of air may cause an impeller (not shown) within the meter/corrector 102 to turn. Each turn of the impeller causes the meter/corrector 102 to generate a number of output pulses. The meter/corrector sends the output pulse information over the output pulse communication interface 118B. In some implementations, the meter/corrector 102 may also send the output pulses over the serial communication and control interface 118A.",
        "The meter/corrector 102 has, in addition to the volume sensing functionality, correction functionality to correct the volume measurement based on the temperature and/or pressure within the line 104. In some embodiments, the temperature sensor 114 and/or the pressure sensor 116 may measure the temperature and pressure, respectively, within the line 104. In other implementations, sensors for temperature and/or pressure may be configured to sense temperature external to the gas line 104. For example, a temperature sensor may be placed in a temperature bath to simulate a temperature condition at the bath temperature. The meter/corrector 102 may use the temperature and/or pressure measurements to adjust the number of output pulses according to correction algorithms. The corrected output pulses may then be sent over the COM interfaces 118A-B. In this example, the correction operation may be performed by the processing unit 120. The processing unit 120 may include digital and/or analog circuitry, and may include programmable devices containing executable instructions (i.e. software). The meter/corrector 102 may be configured to output several different formats over the COM interfaces 118A-B, such as, corrected pulses, uncorrected pulses, corrected pulses in proving mode, and uncorrected pulses in proving mode. The meter/corrector 102 may also output high frequency pulses over the COM interface 118A. These formats will be described in further detail with reference to FIG. 2.",
        "The transfer prover 106 includes a blower 122, a volume sensor 124, a temperature sensor 126, and COM interfaces 128A-B. The volume sensor 124 may include one or more meters that may be referred to as master meters. In some implementations, the transfer prover 106 may also include a processing unit 130 and/or a pressure sensor 132. The transfer prover 106 provides the test air flow using the blower 122. The transfer prover 106 measures the reference volume by monitoring the volume sensor 124. The transfer prover 106 may correct the reference volume measurement based on measurements from the temperature sensor 126 and/or the pressure sensor 132. In some examples, the pressure and/or temperature may be sensed external to the transfer prover. The transfer prover 106 may receive output pulses from the meter/corrector 102 via the COM interface 128A, which is connected to the test interface 110. The transfer prover 106 may process, store, transmit, or compare the output pulses. When the number of output pulses from the meter/corrector 102 matches the test flow volume, the transfer prover 106 may send the results of the test, such as the reference volume measurement and an error between the reference volume and the test volume, to the computer device 108 via the COM interface 128B.",
        "Some transfer provers may include two or more volume sensors (i.e., volume meters or \u201cmaster meters\u201d). Different sized volume meters, for example, may provide for accurate measurements over different ranges of flow rates. In this example, the transfer prover 106 includes two volume meters, a meter A and a meter B, which may have different flow rate capacities. Combined accuracy testing of meter/correctors may involve selecting the appropriate sized volume meter A,B based on the flow rate used for the accuracy test.",
        "Using the test interface 110, software running on the computer device 108 may control the flow of communication to and from the computer device 108 and the meter/corrector 102. The software may also control the flow of output pulse signals from the meter/corrector 102 to the transfer prover 106, using the test interface 110. In one embodiment, software running on the computer device 108 may calculate the required number of test output pulses to be received from the meter/corrector 102 and the equivalent test volume. After temperature and pressure conditions within the line 104 substantially stabilize, the transfer prover 106 may start measuring the reference volume according to the output pulses received from the meter/corrector 102. The transfer prover 106 counts the output pulses. When it receives the required number of test output pulses, the transfer prover 106 may determine the reference volume measured by the volume sensor 124.",
        "For example, the computer device 108 may receive configuration parameters from the transfer prover 106, such as the size of the selected master meter A, B within the transfer prover 106, and pressure and/or temperature values in various places in the transfer prover 106, via a data link 134. The computer device 108 may send a control signal via link 136 to the test interface 110 instructing the test interface 110 to route communications between the computer device 108 and the COM interface 118A of the meter/corrector 102. The test interface 110 may operate one or more switches (e.g. multiplexers) to route the communications. The computer device 108 may receive configuration parameters from the meter/corrector 102, via the link 136 and a link 138. The parameters from the meter/corrector 102 may include information, such as a size of the meter, a type of the meter, a current configured test type, an indication of whether temperature correction will occur, an indication of whether pressure correction will occur, a current temperature measurement, and/or a current pressure measurement, for example. The computer device 108 may use parameters loaded from the transfer prover 106, the meter/corrector 102, and parameters specified by a user to validate and/or prepare to perform an accuracy test of the meter/corrector 102.",
        "In some examples, the computer device 108 may notify the user if the parameters for the test are invalid. For example, some types of output pulses may have a fixed pulse width, which may be expressed as a length of time (e.g. 100 milliseconds). As the rate of flow increases through the line 104, the time between pulses may decrease. If the time between the start of each pulse is substantially equal to or less than the width of a pulse, then the pulses may overlap and become indistinguishable from one another. Accordingly, software running within the computer device 108 may check for the likelihood of this to occur in order to determine whether, for example, a selected test flow rate is valid. In some embodiments, the check may be determined based, at least in part, on parameters, such as the pulse output limits of the volume sensor 112 and the volume sensor 124. If the selected flow rate is high enough that the pulses from either of the volume sensors 112 and 124 will overlap, then the test parameters may be deemed invalid and the user may be notified.",
        "After determining that the test parameters are valid, the computer device 108 may initiate the gas meter and volume corrector accuracy test. In one implementation of the gas meter and volume corrector accuracy test, the computer device 108 sends a control signal to the test interface 110 to instruct the test interface 110 to route a particular output pulse type from the meter/corrector 102 to the transfer prover 106 via the link 136. The test interface 110 may receive output pulse information from the meter/corrector 102 via the link 138 and/or a link 140. The test interface 110 may pass the pulse information to the transfer prover 106 via link 142 and COM interface 128A. The computer device 108 may initiate the gas meter and volume corrector accuracy test by sending information representing a calculated number of test pulses to the transfer prover 106, and signaling the transfer prover 106 to start the blower 122. The transfer prover 106 may then measure reference pulses using the volume sensor 124 until the transfer prover 106 receives the calculated number of test pulses from the meter/corrector 102 through the test interface 110. The calculated number of test pulses indicates that the meter/corrector 102 has measured the desired test volume. The transfer prover 106 sends the measured reference volume to the computer device 108, as indicated by the data link 134.",
        "An error may be calculated between the test volume measured by the meter/corrector 102 and the reference volume measured by the transfer prover 106. A test may be repeated and the results averaged to obtain a reliable test result. The test may be repeated one or more times at one or more flow rates to determine whether the meter/corrector 102 is accurate over a range of operating conditions, for example. In addition, one or more types of tests may be performed. For example, if the uncorrected pulses of the volume sensor 112 differ from the uncorrected pulses from the volume sensor 124, over some threshold, then an error may be found in the volume metering element of the meter/corrector 102. For another example, if the uncorrected pulses match and the corrected pulses differ, then the error may be due to the temperature and pressure correction elements of the meter/corrector 102.",
        "FIG. 1B shows the exemplary test setup 100 for determining the accuracy of an integrated gas meter and corrector in a field environment. In this example, the line 104 may be designed to transport gas, for example, from an upstream portion 144 to a downstream portion 146. Generally, the purpose of the meter/corrector 102 is to measure the volume of gas flowing through the line 104. When the meter/corrector 102 is tested in the field environment, in line valves 148 and 150 may be closed to isolate the meter/corrector 102 from the rest of the line 104. Bypass valves 152 and 154 may be opened to connect the transfer prover 106 to the meter/corrector 102 and to provide for airflow during the test. During the test, the blower 122 causes air to flow from the bypass valve 152, through the meter/corrector 102, the bypass valve 156, and the transfer prover 106. In the implementation shown here, the bypass line at 156, 158 are open to atmospheric pressure. In some implementations, portions of the bypassed line may be closed or restricted to generate line pressures substantially above ambient air pressure. The operations for testing the meter/corrector 102 may be the same as those described above with reference to FIG. 1A.",
        "FIGS. 1B-1C illustrate integrated volume correctors and meters. In a typical integrated meter, pulses may be generated based directly on the rotation of the impeller in the meter, e.g., one pulse per revolution. Such high frequency (HF) pulses may provide a high resolution. Another type of meter is a standard or non-integrated volume corrector and meter. In some embodiments of non-integrated systems, the pulse output from the volume sensor may be conditioned to generate a signal to the volume corrector at a rate corresponding to volume of gas through the meter. For example, a standard meter may send a pulse to a separate volume corrector once for every 10 cubic feet of gas that flows through the meter.",
        "FIG. 1C shows another exemplary setup 100 for determining the accuracy of a standard (i.e., non-integrated) gas meter and corrector in a field environment. Here, the gas meter 102A and the corrector 102B are separate. The volume sensor 112 in the gas meter 102A sends its output signal, which may be a pulse, to a signal conditioning device 160. The signal conditioning device 160 prepares the pulses for transmission to the corrector 102B via the link 162. The corrector 102B may modify the pulses based on the temperature and pressure, and may output the modified pulses through the COM interfaces 118A and/or 118B. In the test setup 100 with the standard gas meter and corrector, the high frequency (HF) output from the corrector 102B may or may not be available. The high frequency output of the corrector 102B requires that the corrector 102B have access to the impeller within the volume sensor 112. The corrector 102B may output corrected pulses, uncorrected pulses, corrected pulses in proving mode, or uncorrected pulses in proving mode. The operations for testing the gas meter 102A and corrector 102B may be the same as those described above with reference to FIG. 1A. The test setup 100 may determine if an error produced by the test is due to the gas meter 102A or the corrector 102B. In addition, the setup 100 shown allows for the determination of an error introduced by the interface between the gas meter 102A and the corrector 102B via the link 162.",
        "FIG. 2 shows an exemplary implementation of the test interface 110. The test interface 110 may route communication between the meter/corrector 102 and the computer device 108. The meter/corrector 102 may be an integrated gas meter and corrector or a standard gas meter and corrector. The meter/corrector 102 includes the gas meter 102A and the corrector 102B. The test interface 110 may also route pulse outputs from the meter/corrector 102 to the transfer prover 106. To accomplish the routing, the test interface 110 includes switches that may be controlled by software running on the computer device 108, for example.",
        "The test interface 110 of this example includes an interface 202A to the computer device 108, an interface 202B to the transfer prover 106, an interface 202C to the pulse output of the meter/corrector 102, and an interface 202D to the communications interface of the meter/corrector 102. The interfaces 202A-D may be wireless, such as infrared (IR) and radio frequency (RF), wired, such as fiber optic cable or electrical cable, or a combination of wireless and wired connections. In some embodiments, one or more of the interfaces 202A-D may use custom or standard protocols, such as Bluetooth, RS-232, Universal Serial Bus (USB), and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), for example. The test interface 110 includes switches 204A-C that route communication between the interfaces 202A-D.",
        "Before performing a gas meter and volume corrector accuracy test, the test interface 110 may be used to perform test preparation operations. For example, during the test preparation operations, the switch 204C may connect the computer device 108 to the communications interface of the meter/corrector 102. This allows the meter/corrector 102 to send its configuration parameters (A) to the computer device 108 via data paths 206 and 208. This also allows the computer device 108 to transmit signals (B) to control the meter/corrector 102, such as by selecting a pulse type for the meter/corrector 102 to output during the test. During the test execution, the switches 204A-C may be set to direct a particular output pulse type to the transfer prover 106. For example, the test interface 110 may direct corrected and/or uncorrected pulses (E) from the interface 202C to the transfer prover 106 via data paths 210 and 212. The test interface 110 may direct corrected and/or uncorrected pulses in proving mode (D) to the transfer prover 106. Here, there are two possible sources of corrected and uncorrected pulses in proving mode (D). The corrected and uncorrected pulses in proving mode (D) may be routed from the interface 202D and through the switches 204C, 204B, and 204A via data paths 206, 214, and 212, or from interface 202C through the switches 204B and 204A via data paths 210 and 212. The test interface 110 may route high frequency pulses (C) to the transfer prover 106 via data paths 206, 216, and 212, through the switches 204C and 204A.",
        "In general, the volume sensor 112 may, with some conditioning, produce an uncorrected pulse output. Each pulse may correspond to some volume that has flowed through the meter.",
        "Another output pulse format available from the corrector is the high frequency pulse output. In integrated meter and corrector systems, the corrector may bypass the uncorrected pulse output from the meter and directly detect rotation of an impeller within the meter to form the high frequency output. The direct detection may be measured in smaller increments of impeller rotation than the uncorrected pulses, producing a higher frequency of pulses. High frequency pulses may undergo processing (not shown) to scale the number of pulses to an equivalent of the corrected and uncorrected pulses. The high frequency pulse output may provide higher precision than the uncorrected and corrected pulse outputs.",
        "If a meter/corrector fails an accuracy test based on the high frequency output format, then one possible cause of the failure may be found in the meter. If a meter/corrector passes an accuracy test based on the high frequency pulse output format, but the same system fails an accuracy test based on the uncorrected pulse output, then one possible cause of the failure may be found in an interface between the meter and the corrector. If a meter/corrector passes an accuracy test based on the uncorrected pulse output format, but the same system fails an accuracy test based on the corrected pulse output format, then one possible cause of the failure may be found in the corrector. In another example, more than one test type may fail, which may indicate that more than one component of the meter/corrector 102 has failed.",
        "Visual indicators 218 on the test interface 110 may display information about, for example, which of the output pulse formats is currently selected, uncorrected, corrected, or high frequency. The visual indicators 218 may also indicate the status of a power supply.",
