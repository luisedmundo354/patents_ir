        "This patent application is a divisional of U.S. patent application No. 10/335,400, filed on Dec. 31, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,884,892.",
        "The present invention relates to production methods of intermediates, particularly epoxytriazole derivative, for triazole compounds useful as an anti-fungal agent.",
        "The epoxytriazole derivative represented by the formula (VI)",
        "(hereinafter to be also referred to as epoxytriazole derivative (VI)) is a useful synthetic intermediate for anti-fungal agents, such as triazole compounds described in JP-A-4-356471, U.S. Pat. No. 5,405,861 and the like.",
        "The production methods of epoxytriazole derivative (VI) have been reported in, for example, Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan (Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn), Vol. 67, 1427-1433 (1994), The Chemical Society of Japan, May 1994, vol. 67, No. 5, pp. 1427-1433, Chemical & Pharmaceutical Bulletin (Chem. Pharm. Bull.), Vol. 43(3), 432-440 (1995), Pharmaceutical Society of Japan, vol. 43, No. 3, pp. 432-440 (1995) and the like. According to these methods, as shown in the following reaction schemes, epoxidation of a compound of the formula (VII) (hereinafter to be also referred to as compound (VII)) wherein hydroxyl group is protected by a protecting group, such as tetrahydropyranyl group and the like, is conducted using trimethyloxosulfonium halide.",
        "",
        "The compound (VII) used as a starting material in conventional methods can be produced by protecting hydroxyl group of a compound, wherein tetrahydropyranyl group of the formula (VII) has been substituted by hydroxyl group (to be also referred to as a deprotected compound of compound (VII)), with tetrahydropyranyl group. However, the introduction of a protecting group is uneconomical because it requires an equimolar amount of tetrahydropyranyl derivative relative to the deprotected compound of compound (VII), and the like. In addition, the introduction of protecting group necessitates a deprotection step, thus increasing the number of steps and the like. Moreover, the introduction of protecting group leads to inefficiency. Thus, this method is industrially disadvantageous. According to conventional methods, moreover, stereoisomers, which are in a diastereomeric relationship and resist use thereof as an intermediate for a triazole compound, which is an anti-fungal agent, are by-produced in about 20%. The \u03b1-hydroxy-ketone derivative, which is a deprotected compound of compound (VII), is chemically unstable, and the above-mentioned epoxidation without protection of hydroxyl group has been considered to be difficult.",

        "As a result of the intensive studies done by the present inventors, they have found that the above-mentioned epoxidation unexpectedly proceeds even without protecting the deprotected compound of compound (VII), which has been expected to be difficult.

When the amount of the base to be used in Step A is less than 0.25 mol relative to 1 mol of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt, trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt remains more than necessary, which is economically disadvantageous, and unpreferably causes side reaction. When the amount of the base to be used exceeds 1.1 mol relative to 1 mol of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt, a base unreacted with trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt remains in excess, which is economically disadvantageous and causes a side reaction (mostly isomerization) to possibly degrade the yield and quality.",
        "The amount of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt to be used in Step A is generally 0.8 mol-5.0 mol, preferably 1.0 mol-3.0 mol, more preferably 1.1 mol-2.5 mol, relative to 1 mol of compound (I). When the amount of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt to be used in Step A is less than 0.8 mol relative to 1 mol of compound (I), compound (I) partly remains unreacted to possibly lower the yield. When the amount of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt to be used exceeds 5.0 mol relative to 1 mol of compound (I), the effect corresponding to the amount used cannot be afforded, which is economically disadvantageous.",

        "The compound (II) to be obtained in Step A can be isolated and purified by a conventional method. For example, the reaction mixture is poured into water and partitioned, the organic layer is washed and filtrated, and the obtained filtrate is washed, dried and concentrated under reduced pressure to isolate compound (II). After the isolation, for example, it is subjected to silica gel column chromatography for purification. The compound (II) can be used for the next reaction without purification.",

Jpn, Vol. 67, 1427-1433 (1994), by a known method. An optically active compound (I) can be obtained by deprotection of optically active compound (VII) disclosed in Chem. Pharm. Bull., Vol. 41(6), 1035-1042 (1993) in the same manner, or by the method described in Tetrahedron Letters, 37, 8117-8120 (1996).

(2R)-2-(1-Ethoxyethoxy)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1-propanone is a novel compound, and can be produced by a method described in Reference Example 1 below or a method analogous thereto. That is, (R)-alkyl lactate is reacted with dialkylamine to give (R)-dialkyl lactamide, which is reacted with ethyl vinyl ether to protect hydroxyl group with 1-ethoxyethyl group, and then reacted with 2,4-difluorophenylmagnesium halide.",

The amount of the base to be used in Step B, which is less than 0.3 mol relative to 1 mol of 1,2,4-triazole, is unpreferable, because 1,2,4-triazole remains more than necessary, which is economically disadvantageous, and 1,2,4-triazole remaining after the reaction needs to be separated.

The objective fraction was concentrated to give a pale-yellow oil (0.297 g). The obtained pale-yellow oil was crystallized from a mixed solvent of ethyl acetate (1 mL)\u2014n-heptane (4 mL) to give the title compound (0.185 g, yield from (2R)-2\u2032,4\u2032-difluoro-2-hydroxypropiophenone: 44%). As a result of analysis by HPLC, the optical purity was 100% e.e.",

        "Sodium hydride (60% dispersion in oil, 0.68 g, 17.0 mmol) was added to dimethyl sulfoxide (40 mL) and trimethyloxosulfonium iodide (3.91 g, 17.8 mmol) was added in small portions at 15-20\u00b0 C. After generation of hydrogen stopped, a solution (8 mL) of (2R)-2\u2032,4\u2032-difluoro-2-(3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yloxy)propiophenone (4.0 g, 14.8 mmol) in dimethyl sulfoxide was added dropwise, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. After the completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was added dropwise to water (120 mL), and the mixture was extracted 3 times with ethyl acetate (120 mL, 80 mL\u00d72). The layers extracted with ethyl acetate were mixed, washed twice with saturated brine (40 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the filtrate (ethyl acetate solution) was concentrated. The obtained concentrate was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (SiO2, 50 g) and eluted with n-heptane\u2014ethyl acetate (10:1).

        "The protecting group of the obtained pale-yellow oil was removed by the same method as in Reference Example 1 and analyzed under the same HPLC conditions as in Example 1. As a result, the ratio of the title compound and a diastereomer thereof, (2R,3S)-compound, was 4:1.",
        "As shown by the above results, the reaction of the compound (I) not protected with trimethyloxosulfonium salt and the like surprisingly proceeded easily to give compound (II). When compound (I) was in an optically active form, induction of racemization in this reaction was worried, but racemization was not observed in most cases. As shown in Comparative Example 1 and Examples 1 and 2, the use of compound (I) resulted in strikingly improved diastereoselectivity as compared to the use of a compound protected by tetrahydropyranyl group. As shown in Example 4, moreover, epoxytriazole derivative (V) could be synthesized efficiently from compound (IV), which was produced by substituting the hydroxyl group in compound (II) for a leaving group.",
        "According to the production method of the present invention, the steps of protection and deprotection can be eliminated and diastereoselectivity can be strikingly improved. Moreover, by substituting the hydroxyl group for a leaving group in compound (II), epoxytriazole derivative (V) and an intermediate therefor having high quality can be produced economically and efficiently by an industrial means.",
