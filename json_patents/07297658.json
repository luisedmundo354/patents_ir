        "This invention relates to non-photosensitive thermographic materials, particularly black-and-white direct thermographic materials, having a unique adhesive layer (\u201ccarrier\u201d layer) between the imaging layers and a polymeric support. The invention also relates to methods of imaging such direct thermographic materials.",
        "Silver-containing direct thermographic imaging materials are non-photosensitive materials that are used in a recording process wherein images are generated by the direct application of thermal energy and in the absence of a processing solvent. These materials have been known in the art for many years and generally comprise a support having disposed thereon one or more imaging layers comprising (a) a relatively or completely non-photosensitive source of reducible silver ions, (b) a reducing agent composition (acting as a black-and-white silver developer) for the reducible silver ions, and (c) a suitable binder. Thermographic materials are sometimes called \u201cdirect thermal\u201d materials in the art because they are directly imaged by a source of thermal energy without any transfer of the image or image-forming materials to another element (such as in thermal dye transfer).",
        "In a typical thermographic construction, the image-forming thermographic layers comprise silver salts of long chain fatty acids. The preferred non-photosensitive reducible silver source is a silver salt of a long chain aliphatic carboxylic acid having from 10 to 30 carbon atoms, such as behenic acid or mixtures of acids of similar molecular weight. At elevated temperatures, the silver(I) of the silver carboxylate is reduced by a reducing agent (also known as a developer), whereby elemental silver is formed. Imagewise heating, such as by using a thermal print-head, results in a black-and-white image.",
        "As noted above, direct thermographic materials are imaged by a recording process whereby images are generated by imagewise heating a recording material containing chemical components that change color or optical density in an imagewise fashion. Such materials generally include one or more thermographic (imaging) layers on a polymeric support. Adhesion between those layers and the support is a concern because of the high temperatures to which the material is exposed during imaging and transport through an imaging device. There is a risk that pieces of the imaged material can flake off during this process causing debris and damage to both the imaged material and imaging equipment. In addition, there is a concern that various chemicals can migrate out of the material into the imaging device.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 6,436,622 (Geisler) describes direct thermographic materials that include an adhesion-promoting or carrier layer between the imaging layers and the polymeric support. Polyisocyanates are described for use as hardeners for binders in the thermographic layers. Polyisocyanates have also been described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,313,065 (Horsten et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,275,932 (Weigel et al.), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,548 (Bjork et al.) as hardeners for topcoat layers of thermographic materials.",

It is particularly desired that the outermost (\u201cfirst\u201d) protective layer have a dynamic coefficient of friction of less than 0.3 when the thermographic material is moved in contact and relative to an imaging means such as a thermal print-head. This \u201cslip\u201d property is usually provided by incorporating one or more lubricants into the outermost protective layer. Mixtures of lubricants such as one or more solid lubricants and one or more liquid lubricants can be used. The dynamic coefficient of friction can be measured as described in U.S. Pat.

Simultaneous multilayer coating using carrier layers is preferred in high-speed manufacturing processes. If the thermographic material is duplitized, the non-light sensitive adhesive layer can have the same or different composition and thickness on both sides of the support. For the remainder of this section, the term \u201ccarrier\u201d layer will be used in reference to the non-light sensitive adhesive layer. In preferred embodiments, the carrier layer is the only layer between the support and the thermographic layers on either or both sides of the support. Thus, the carrier layer is directly disposed on the support without the use of additional primer or subbing layers and allows the support can be used in an \u201cuntreated\u201d and \u201cuncoated\u201d form before application of the carrier layer and other layers.",

        "The preferred metal oxide particles are generally provided for formulation in inorganic colloidal or sol form in a suitable solvent such as water or a water-miscible solvent such as methanol or other low molecular weight alcohols. The inorganic metal oxide colloids include oxide colloids of zinc, magnesium, silicon, calcium, aluminum, strontium, barium, zirconium, titanium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, tin, indium, molybdenum, or vanadium, or mixtures of these metal oxide colloids.

        "Layer formulations described herein can be coated by various coating procedures including wire wound rod coating, dip coating, air knife coating, curtain coating, slide coating, or extrusion coating using hoppers of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,681,294 (Beguin). The formulations can be coated one at a time and dried before application of another layer. Preferably, two or more formulations can be coated simultaneously by coating the multiple layers on top of a first applied layer while that layer is still wet using the same or different coating fluids or solvent mixtures using the procedures described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,761,791 (Russell), U.S. Pat. No. 4,001,024 (Dittman et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 4,569,863 (Keopke et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,340,613 (Hanzalik et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,405,740 (LaBelle), U.S. Pat.

The coated materials can be dried in forced air at a temperature of from about 20\u00b0 C. to about 100\u00b0 C. It is preferred that the thickness of the layer be selected to provide maximum image densities greater than about 0.2, and more preferably, from about 0.5 to 5.0 or more, as measured by an X-rite Model 361/V Densitometer equipped with 301 Visual Optics.",
        "Imaging/Development",
        "The direct thermographic materials can be imaged in any suitable manner consistent with the type of material using any suitable source of thermal energy. The image may be \u201cwritten\u201d simultaneously with development at a suitable temperature using a thermal stylus, a thermal print-head (including an array of thermal print-heads), or a laser, or by heating the material as it is moved while in contact with a heat absorbing material. The thermographic materials may include a dye (such as an IR-absorbing dye) to facilitate direct development by exposure to laser radiation. The dye converts absorbed radiation to heat. Thermal development is carried out with the materials being in a substantially water-free environment and without application of any solvent to the materials.",
        "Use as a Photomask",
        "The direct thermographic materials are sufficiently transmissive in the range of from about 350 to about 450 nm in non-imaged areas to allow their use in a method where there is a subsequent exposure of an ultraviolet or short wavelength visible radiation sensitive imageable medium. For example, imaging and development of the materials affords a visible image. The thermographic materials absorb ultraviolet or short wavelength visible radiation in the areas where there is a visible image and transmit ultraviolet or short wavelength visible radiation where there is no visible image. The materials may then be used as a mask and positioned between a source of imaging radiation (such as an ultraviolet or short wavelength visible radiation energy source) and an imageable material that is sensitive to such imaging radiation, such as a photopolymer, diazo material, photoresist, or photosensitive printing plate. Exposing the imageable material to the imaging radiation through the visible image in the thermographic material provides an image in the imageable material. This method is particularly useful where the imageable medium comprises a printing plate and the thermographic material serves as an imagesetting film.",

Non-imaged thermographic samples as well as thermographic samples that had been imaged to a Dmax greater than 3 were evaluated. Frontside coatings were cut with a razor blade in a cross-hatched pattern, a 1 inch (2.54 cm) wide piece of commercially available 3M Type 610 semi-transparent pressure-sensitive tape was placed on the pattern and then quickly lifted off. The amount of coating removed from the film is the measure of adhesion. The adhesion test ratings are from 0 to 5 where 0 refers to complete removal of the coating and 5 refers none or very little coating removed. A rating of \u201c2\u201d or greater is considered to be acceptable for developed samples. 3M Type 610 semi-transparent pressure-sensitive tape was obtained from 3M Company (Maplewood, Minn.).",
