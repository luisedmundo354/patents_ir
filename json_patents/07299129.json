No. 7,099,775, the specification of which is incorporated herein by reference, which is in turn a Continuation-in-Part of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/115,611 filed Apr. 2, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,795,770, the specification of which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "The present invention relates generally to navigational devices, and in particular to navigational devices as part of a combined multi-functional system.",
        "A natural progression in devices is to build more function or even to combine more functions into one device. In the past ten years, for example, mobile communications, personal data assistants, and portable navigational devices have boomed. Currently, millions use cellular phones on a daily basis. Cellular phones have become so inexpensive that college students can readily afford them. Cellular phones have been given added capability. Some have been provided with paging capability, for example. Recently, cellular phones have been provided with the ability to interface with the internet. Current cell phones also have calendaring capabilities built in and some are now being combined with personal data assistants (\u201cPDAs\u201d).",
        "PDAs are now also exceedingly popular. The first PDA-type devices merely held a listing of contacts and may have had a calendar function. Now PDAs, in addition to holding contact data and a calendar, hold e-mail. PDAs have now been provided with the capability to respond to e-mail and are linked or synchronized with a computer periodically so any e-mail answers can be ported over to a computer for sending. Calendar changes are also synchronized.",
        "Navigational devices represent yet another technology that has boomed as of late and which is now becoming popular and affordable. Previously, navigational devices were expensive and far from portable or hand-held. Most navigational devices could only be found on ships and airplanes. Now, navigational devices are popular options in luxury cars and navigational devices have become popular with outdoorsman of all types. Fisherman have them to mark out there favorite fishing holes, for example. These devices have also been combined with other devices, such as depth finders or fish finders which are popular with anglers.",
        "Recently, PDAs and navigational devices, such as global positioning systems (\u201cGPS\u201d), have been combined. There are problems with such combined devices. For example, current combination devices which include a PDA and a GPS are confusing to use. One of the more confusing aspects is switching between the software applications needed for the GPS and the software applications needed for the PDA.",
        "Still another problem is that the GPS or navigational devices generally use more power than other portable technologies that can be included in a portable, electronic device. The hardware needed to acquire signals from satellites is generally much more needy of power than the power needed to keep a cellular phone or a PDA operating. Thus, one of the problems associated with marrying a GPS with another device is that the length between charges for the other device may decline drastically. In other words, the more power hungry GPS portion of a combination device will discharge the batteries faster than a separate PDA, cellular phone or other device.",
        "There are also problems with maintaining a relatively small size while still having the necessary capability to acquire the satellite signals needed to determine position on the GPS portion of the device. A GPS generally needs a fairly substantial antenna. Incorporating the antenna into the housing of a combined GPS and PDA may wreck havoc with the size of the device. As a result, all combination models are provided with an external GPS antenna. Using a patch antenna in such hand-held devices is advantageous since these are more low profile. However, there is a problem with fixing the antenna into a device since the antenna is generally most effective orientated a specific way with the satellites rather than oriented with respect to a housing or the case of the combined device. For example, a patch antenna is most effective if it is essentially parallel with the earth's surface. Many of the housings are made to be used in a hand-held mode. When holding the housing the housing is generally horizontally orientated. If a hand-held unit is to be mounted in an automobile, the mounting orientation is limited to more horizontal orientations so that the antenna is effective. A large problem with mounting a device with a fixed antenna so that the antenna is effective at receiving GPS signals generally makes the display almost impossible for the driver to see. As a result, an antenna fixed with respect to the housing may suffer in one use as compared to another. Providing a movable antenna also presents the problems of keeping the antenna at a position, especially in a vibrating environment such as driving down a dusty washboard gravel road.",
        "There is always a problem with carrying separate devices. Each one needs a power cord, different batteries and other different accessories. So there is always a need for combined functions in one device. What is needed is a portable, hand-held electronic device that is user friendly and generally easy to use. For example, one that switches from one application to another with ease or even automatically. What is also needed is a device that includes a power savings mode so that the user is not continually recharging the device rather than using it. There is still a further need for a device that is small enough that it is handy to use and store in a pocket or purse. There is also a need for a device that minimizes the number of auxiliary accessories that must be carried. Specifically, there is also a need for a device that includes a GPS or other navigational device with other devices. Such a device needs an antenna which is part of the device but which is also positionable to more than one position. Also needed is a device which can operate in a hand-held orientation or in a car-mounted orientation. The device also needs to be neat and which is free of wires routed externally about the housing. The device also needs to be durable. There is also a need for a navigational route planning device which rapidly and efficiently generates a route plan, especially when a route was not completed.",
        "The embodiments of the present invention include a portable electronic device having a housing, a processor located within the housing, a memory in communication with the processor, and a display in communication with the processor. The display is positioned on a surface of the housing. The portable electronic device has a first component, and a second component. One of the first and second components include a navigational component. The navigational component further includes an antenna attached to the housing. The antenna is a patch antenna having a width of about 1 inch and a length of about 1 inch. The antenna is movable between a stowed position and a signal acquisition position. The navigational component has a detection mechanism which indicates the antenna is in the signal acquisition position. The navigational component also includes an operational component which is activated in response to the detection mechanism indicating the antenna is in the signal acquisition position. In some embodiments, the operational component includes a global position information acquisition component which is enabled in response to the detection mechanism indicating the antenna is in the signal acquisition position. The operational component includes a set of instructions executable by the processor for processing signals acquired by the antenna. The set of instructions is enabled when the detection mechanism indicates the antenna is in the signal acquisition position. The set of instructions is disabled in response to the detection mechanism indicating the antenna has been moved from the signal acquisition position to the stowed position. The display switches to the user interface associated with the navigational component in response to the detection mechanism indicating the antenna is in the signal acquisition position. The navigational component is a positioning system which uses at least three signals to triangulate a position, such as a GPS.",
        "Also disclosed are embodiments that include a navigation system that has a mass storage device adapted to store navigation data, a server adapted to communicate with the mass storage, and the portable, multi-function electronic device discussed in the previous paragraph. The navigational device has an operational component which is activated in response to the detection mechanism indicating the antenna is in the signal acquisition position. The operational component includes a power savings mode which is enabled in response to the detection mechanism indicating that the antenna position has been changed to the stowed position from the signal acquisition position. The power savings mode includes halting a signal acquisition process. The operational component includes a set of software instructions executed by the processor or hardwired combinatorial logic.",
        "Advantageously, embodiments of the invention provide for a device having a navigational component and one or more other f unctions, such as a PDA function or a cellular phone function. The portable, hand-held electronic device is user friendly since one function switches to another essentially automatically. The portable, hand-held electronics device includes a power savings mode so that the user is not continually recharging the device rather than using it. The device is small enough to be handy to use and stores in a pocket or purse. The device includes a GPS or other navigational device with other devices. The GPS antenna is low profile and is positionable to more than one position so that the device can operate in a hand-held orientation or in a car-mounted orientation. The device is durable, and free of wires routed externally about the housing. Routing the connector between the antenna and hardware within the case provides for a neat, uncluttered design.",
        "Embodiments of the present invention further include a hand held device, such as a portable global positioning device, that has a personal digital assistant (PDA) capability (e.g., a PDA component operable to perform one or more PDA functions), a global positioning satellite (GPS) receiver operative with the PDA capability, an antenna coupled to the GPS receiver, a housing containing the PDA capability and the GPS receiver, a subhousing containing the antenna, the subhousing being pivotally attached to the housing, and an actuator to control the movement and position of the subhousing relative the housing, where the actuator allows the subhousing to pivot from a stowed position to a released position relative the housing. At least a portion of the actuator is accessible through a surface of the housing to allow the actuator to be moved so as to release the subhousing from the stowed position into the released position. In one embodiment, the actuator includes a release lever having a contact surface, a latch, and an elongate shaft there between. The contact surface is accessible through the housing to slide adjacent the housing from a latching position in which the latch releasably holds the subhousing in the stowed position to a release position such that the subhousing moves to the released position.",
        "The actuator further includes a mechanical linkage pivotally attaching the housing and the subhousing, where the mechanical linkage includes a cam mechanism that can act to move the subhousing from the stowed position to the released position. The mechanical linkage allows the subhousing to travel outwardly and upwardly from a back wall of the housing.",
        "In one embodiment, the cam mechanism includes a first cam associated with the housing, the first cam having a surface forming detents. The cam mechanism further includes a second cam associated with the subhousing, the second cam having a surface forming detents that can seat and un-seat with the surface of the first cam when the subhousing is in the released position or a number of other predetermined positions. The cam mechanism further includes a spring and a spring housing coupled to the second cam, where the spring housing includes a sleeve to receive the spring. The spring housing also has a surface forming a key, where the spring housing is at least partially positioned within a socket of the subhousing. In one embodiment, the key prevents rotational motion of the spring housing in the subhousing as the subhousing is moved relative the housing.",
        "As the subhousing is moved relative the housing, the detents of the first and second cams can move between seated and un-seated positions. When the cams are in their unseated position the detents are inclined at an angle and biased by the spring to allow for subsequent movement of the second cam relative the first cam. For example, as the subhousing moves from the released position to the stowed position the surface of the first and second cams un-seat to be inclined at an angle and biased by the spring to allow for the subhousing to move from the stowed position to the released position. The subhousing can subsequently be moved into one or more additional predetermined positions.",
        "The embodiments of the portable global positioning device further include navigational capabilities (e.g., a navigation component operable to perform one or more navigation functions) operative with the GPS receiver, and a detection mechanism that indicates when the subhousing is in the released position. In one embodiment, the detection mechanism can trigger activation of the navigational capabilities when the subhousing is in the released position.",
        "A display is in communication with the navigational capabilities and the PDA capability so that the navigational capabilities are displayed when the subhousing is in the released position. In an additional embodiment, the detection mechanism can also indicate when the subhousing is in the stowed position, where the detection mechanism triggers de-activation of the navigational capabilities when the subhousing is in the stowed position. In one embodiment, the detection mechanism includes a Hall Effect switch.",
        "Embodiments of the present invention further include a method that includes providing PDA components operable to perform one or more PDA functions in a housing; providing navigation components operable to perform one or more navigation functions in the housing; providing a GPS antenna in a subhousing, the GPS antenna in communication with the navigation components; and coupling the housing and the subhousing with an actuator that controls a position of the subhousing relative the housing, where the actuator allows the subhousing to pivot from a stowed position to a released position relative the housing. In one embodiment, coupling the housing and the subhousing with the actuator includes installing a mechanical linkage pivotally attaching the housing and the subhousing, the mechanical linkage having the cam mechanism to move the subhousing from the stowed position to the released position.",
        "At least a portion of the actuator can be moved to release the subhousing from the stowed position into the released position. A switch can also be installed in the housing, where the switch changes states when the subhousing moves from the stowed position to the released position. When the switch changes states (e.g., when the subhousing moves from the stowed position to the released position or visa versa) a predetermined sequence of one or more PDA functions and one or more navigation can be preformed.",
        "Embodiments of the present invention further include a method that includes forming the housing for the PDA components; forming the subhousing for the GPS antenna; and coupling the subhousing to the housing for the PDA components with the actuator, where the subhousing moves between the stowed position and the released position relative the housing through the use of the actuator. In one embodiment, coupling the subhousing to the housing includes providing the mechanical linkage to pivotally attach the housing and the subhousing, the mechanical linkage having the cam mechanism to move the subhousing from the stowed position to the released position.",
        "Embodiments of the present invention further include a method of operating the hand-held device described herein. For example, the method can include uncoupling a latch to release the subhousing that is pivotally attach to the housing and mechanically urging the subhousing from the stowed position into the released position relative the housing after uncoupling the latch. As described herein, mechanically urging the subhousing includes converting kinetic movement of a spring into rotational motion of the subhousing relative the housing through an actuator joining the subhousing and the housing. In addition, the method can further include providing the actuator with predetermined seated positions for the subhousing relative the housing.",
        "These and other embodiments, aspects, advantages, and features of the present invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art by reference to the following description of the invention and referenced drawings or by practice of the invention.

The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.",
        "The following description and figures use a reference numeral convention where the first digit of the reference numeral corresponds to the figure and the following two digits correspond to like elements throughout the specification. For example, the housing of a portable, hand-held, electronic device of the present invention has a reference number of 218, 318, 418, 518 etc., corresponding to the housing X18 in FIGS. 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. where X is the number of the figure in which the reference numeral appears.",
        "One type of navigational system includes Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Such systems are known and have a variety of uses. In general, GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system capable of determining continuous position, velocity, time, and in some instances direction information for an unlimited number of users. Formally known as NAVSTAR, the GPS incorporates a plurality of satellites which orbit the earth in extremely precise orbits. Based on these precise orbits, GPS satellites can relay their location to any number of receiving units.",
        "The GPS system is implemented when a device specially equipped to receive GPS data begins scanning radio frequencies for GPS satellite signals. Upon receiving a radio signal from a GPS satellite, the device can determine the precise location of that satellite via one of different conventional methods. The device will continue scanning for signals until it has acquired at least three different satellite signals. Implementing geometrical triangulation, the receiver utilizes the three known positions to determine its own two-dimensional position relative to the satellites. Additionally, acquiring a fourth satellite signal will allow the receiving device to calculate its three-dimensional position by the same geometrical calculation. The positioning and velocity data can be updated in real time on a continuous basis by an unlimited number of users.",
        "In fact, although GPS enabled devices are often used to describe navigational devices, it will be readily appreciated that satellites need not be used at all to determine a geographic position of a receiving unit, since cellular towers or any customized transmitting radio frequency towers can be deployed and combined in groups of three or more. With such a configuration, any standard geometric triangulation algorithm can be used to determine the exact location of the receiving unit. In this way, personal hand-held devices, cell phones, intelligent appliances, intelligent apparel, and others can be readily located geographically, if appropriately equipped to be a receiving unit.",
        "FIG. 1 shows one representative view of a GPS denoted generally by reference numeral 100. A plurality of satellites 120 are in orbit about the Earth 124. The orbit of each satellite 120 is not necessarily synchronous with the orbits of other satellites 120 and, in fact, is likely asynchronous. A Device that includes a GPS receiver 140 of the present invention is shown receiving spread spectrum GPS satellite signals 160 from the various satellites 120.",
        "The spread spectrum signals 160 continuously transmitted from each satellite 120 utilize a highly accurate frequency standard accomplished with an extremely accurate atomic clock. Each satellite 120, as part of its data signal transmission 160, transmits a data stream indicative of that particular satellite 120. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art that the Device that includes a GPS receiver 140 must acquire spread spectrum GPS satellite signals 160 from at least three satellites 120 for the Device that includes a GPS receiver 140 to calculate its two-dimensional position by triangulation. Acquisition of an additional signal 160, resulting in signals 160 from a total of four satellites 120, permits Device that includes a GPS receiver 140 to calculate its three-dimensional position.",
        "Of course as previously presented and as is readily appreciated by those skilled in the art, GPS satellites and GPS receiving devices are not required by the tenets of the present invention, since any receiving device capable or receiving the location from at least three transmitting locations can perform basic triangulation calculations to determine the relative position of the receiving device with respect to the transmitting locations.",
        "For example, at least three cellular towers can each transmit their location information to a receiving cellular phone, or any other receiving device, and if the phones or devices are equipped to perform the triangulation algorithm, then the location of the cellular phone or device can be readily resolved. By further way of example, an amusement park or entertainment facility can deploy three or more transmitting radio frequency devices and provide users with receiving units capable of performing a triangulation algorithm to determine the receiving unit's location within the amusement park or entertainment facility. In this way, it is readily apparent that a receiving unit need not be exclusively GPS enabled to benefit from the teachings of the present invention.",
        "FIGS. 2A-2E illustrate views of one embodiment of an electronic navigational device 210 according to the teachings of the present invention. FIGS. 2A-2E illustrate the top surface of the navigational device, a side view and an end view of the navigational device 210. The navigational device 210 shown in FIGS. 2A-2E includes a personal digital assistant (\u201cPDA\u201d) with integrated GPS receiver according to the teachings of the present invention. The GPS integrated PDA operates with an operating system (\u201cOS\u201d) such as, for example, the well-known Palm or Pocket PC operating systems, or the lesser-used Linux OS. The GPS integrated PDA 210 can also include other devices contained in a housing 218, such as an internal cellular transceiver. The GPS integrated PDA 210 also includes an integrated GPS patch antenna 214. The patch antenna 214 is housed within a subhousing 240 which moves or flips with respect to the housing 218 (the movement of the subhousing will be detailed in FIGS. 3-9). The housing 218 is generally rectangular with a low profile and has a front face 220 extending from a top end 222 to a bottom end 224. Visible through front face 220 is a display screen 226, which is touch sensitive and responsive to a stylus 230 (shown stored in the side view of FIG. 2B) or a finger touch. FIGS. 2A-2E illustrate the stylus 230 nested within housing 218 for storage and convenient access in a conventional manner. The embodiment shown in FIG. 2A illustrates a number of control buttons, or input keys 228 positioned toward the bottom end 224. The invention, however, is not so limited by the position of the control buttons. It should be noted that the input keys 228 can be positioned toward the top end 222 or at any other suitable location. The end view of FIG. 2C illustrates a map data cartridge bay slot 232 and headphone jack 234 provided at the top end 222 of the housing 218. Again, it should be noted that a map data cartridge bay slot 232 and headphone jack 234 could also be provided at the bottom end 224, separately at opposite ends, or at any other suitable location.",

FIG. 2E illustrates another end view of the embodiment of a hand-held, multi-function electronic device shown in FIG. 2A. The end view shown in FIG. 2E is the end opposite the end shown in FIG. 2C.",
        "It should be understood that the structure of GPS integrated PDA 210 is shown as illustrative of one type of integrated PDA navigation device. Other physical structures, such as a cellular telephone and a vehicle-mounted unit are contemplated within the scope of this invention.",
        "FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the back surface 350 of the electronic navigational device 310 shown in FIGS. 2A-2C. As shown in FIG. 3, the subhousing 340 which includes the antenna 314, has been moved or flipped to an open position where the subhousing 340 makes approximately a 110\u00b0 angle with respect to the back surface 350 of the navigational device 310. The patch antenna 314 is contained within the subhousing 340. The subhousing 340 and contained patch antenna 314 rotate upon a hinge 300 which will be further detailed with respect to FIGS. 5 and 8. The hinge allows the subhousing 340 to be open to one of many positions. However, the hinge itself, includes a feature which allows the subhousing 340 to preferentially stop at one of two positions. In the first position, shown in FIG. 3, the subhousing makes approximately a 110\u00b0 angle with respect to the back surface 350 of the navigational device 310. This orientation is needed when the navigational device 310 is to be mounted within a car. It should be noted that the patch antenna 314, in order to be most effective, has to essentially be parallel to the surface of the earth. When the PDA or navigational device 310 that includes a PDA is mounted in an automobile, the orientation shown in FIG. 3 results in the patch antenna 314 housed within the subhousing 340 to be essentially parallel to the surface of the earth to provide for reception of radio signals from one of several satellites used in a GPS system. The housing 318 includes a cavity or depression 352 which corresponds to the size of the subhousing 340. The cavity or depression 352 also includes a latch 354 for catching a mating feature 344 on the subhousing 340 when the subhousing 340 is stowed within the housing 318. Also shown in FIG. 3 is a plunger 622 which is discussed in further detail in the description of FIG. 6 below.",
        "FIG. 4 shows a perspective view of the back of a hand-held multi-functional electronic device 410 as shown in FIGS. 2A-2C, with the movable subhousing 440 and enclosed patch antenna 414 in another open position. As shown in FIG. 4, the subhousing 440 has moved through approximately 180\u00b0 and is essentially flat with respect to the back surface 450 of the navigational device or multi-functional electronic device 410. Again, noting that the patch antenna, in order to be most effective, has to essentially be parallel with respect to the surface of the earth, this particular orientation of the patch antenna 414 provides for effective reception of radio signals from satellite antennas when the navigational device is used in a hand-held mode. In other words, when a user is holding a multi-functional electronic device that includes a navigational device 410, the user generally holds the PDA-shaped device in a orientation that is essentially flat or parallel to the surface of the earth. Therefore, the subhousing 440, including the patch antenna 414, is flipped to a position where both the housing 418 and the subhousing 440 are essentially parallel to the surface of the earth. As mentioned previously, the subhousing 440 is attached to the housing 418 with the hinge 400. The hinge 400 has several preferred open positions which are shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. The housing 418 includes a cavity or depression 452 which corresponds to the size of the subhousing 440. The cavity or depression 452 also includes a latch 454 for catching a mating feature 444 on the subhousing 440. It should be noted that having two preferred open positions so that the patch antenna is always substantially parallel with the surface of the earth or perpendicular to the signals from the satellites provides for the best possible reception of the signals from the satellite. By having the subhousing capable of more than one orientation and actually going to one of two preferred orientations, the patch antenna 414 can be made somewhat smaller than a patch antenna having a fixed orientation with respect to a housing. In this particular application, the patch antenna is approximately 20 mm and fits within the housing 440.",
        "FIG. 5 is a back view of a hand-held multi-functional electronic device 510 with the movable subhousing 540 in a closed position. A hinge 500 allows the subhousing 540 to move with respect to the housing 518. In the closed position, the latch opening and the latch are engaged (shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 as elements 344, 354 and 444, 454). In various embodiments, the latch and the latch opening are engaged with a snap fit between housing 518 and the subhousing 540. The invention, however, is not so limited. In various embodiments, the housing 518 also includes an access depression 560. The access depression 560 allows access to below the surface of the subhousing 540 such that an edge of the subhousing can be reached and such that the subhousing 540 can be moved from the closed position shown in FIG. 5 to an open position such as those shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. It should be noted that the closed position may also be referred to as a stowed position.",
        "FIG. 6 illustrates a perspective view of a multi-functional electronic device 600 according to various embodiments of the present invention. As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 6, a housing 618 and a subhousing 640 are associated with the multi-functional electronic device 600. As noted above, in various embodiments, the multi-function electronic device 600 includes a hand held PDA 600 having integrated GPS capabilities. The perspective view embodiment of FIG. 6 illustrates a back surface 650 of the housing 618. In addition, a depression, or indentation 652 is illustrated in the back surface 650 of the housing 618. As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate upon reading this disclosure, in various embodiments the indentation 652 is configured so that the subhousing 640 can seat flushly into the back surface 650 of the housing 618 when the subhousing 640 is in a first, or stowed position.",
        "As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate upon reading this disclosure, in the various embodiments the subhousing 640 includes a flip-up antenna which is pivotally attached at 655 to the housing 618.

In various embodiments, the subhousing 640 includes a patch GPS antenna 654 as the same will be known and understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. The invention, however, is not limited to a patch GPS antenna in the subhousing 640. Other suitable types of GPS antennas, located in the subhousing 640 are also considered within the scope of the present invention.",
        "The embodiment of FIG. 6 further illustrates another cut-away section view 656 provided to reveal one or more components located beneath the indentation 652 which receives the subhousing 640. As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 6, the one or more components revealed in the cut-away 656 beneath the indentation 652 includes at least one component 658 which is part of a Hall Effect switch as the same will be known and understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. In various embodiments, the at least one component 658 located beneath the indentation 652 includes the detection mechanism 658 of a Hall Effect switch as the same will be known and understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. That is, the component 658 can be a sensor operable to detect the presence of a magnetic field. In this configuration, and as shown in the embodiment of FIG. 6, the subhousing 640 includes a magnet 660 located within the subhousing 640 and positioned to oppose the detection mechanism 658 when the subhousing 640 is in a first, or stowed position (as shown in FIG. 5). Other configurations and placement embodiments are considered within the scope of the present invention.",
        "As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate upon reading this disclosure, when the subhousing 640 is in a first, or stowed position (as shown in FIG. 5) a magnetic field produced by the magnet 660 can trigger the detection mechanism 658 and register a first state and/or produce a first signal representative of the positioning of the subhousing 640, e.g. in a collapsed, closed or stowed position. Likewise, as one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, when the subhousing 640 is in one or more second positions (such as illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4) a magnetic field produced by the magnet 660 can be sufficiently removed, or distanced, from the detection mechanism 658 such that the detection mechanism can register a second state and/or produce a second signal representative of the positioning of the subhousing 640, e.g. in an open, extended, expanded, or flipped-up location in the one or more second positions.",
        "As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate upon reading this disclosure, the Hall Effect switch components described above, e.g. 658 and 660, are but one form of detect switch which can be implemented with the various embodiments of the present invention to provide an indication of a location and/or position of the subhousing 640. Embodiments of the invention are not limited to Hall Effect switches as the sole means for detecting the position of the subhousing 640.",
        "As noted above, however, various embodiments include a Hall Effect switch mechanism to indicate a position or location of the subhousing 640. By way of example and not by way of limitation, a Hall Effect switch, including components 658 and 660, have been shown to register a first state and/or produce a first signal when the subhousing 640 is in the first, or stowed position. Likewise, the Hall Effect switch embodiment of FIG. 6, has been shown to register a second state and/or produce a second signal when the subhousing is in one or more second positions (such as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4). As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate upon reading this disclosure, in various embodiments the first and/or second registered states as well as the first and/or second signals can be received and/or detected by other components, operated upon by one or more sets of computer executable instructions to interact with, initiate and/or control other functions within the PDA 600.",
        "In various embodiments, by way of example and not by way of limitation, when the subhousing is in the first, or stowed position, the first registered state and/or first signal produced by the Hall Effect switch embodiment of FIG. 6 can function to cease providing power to a GPS receiver (e.g. as described in connection with FIG. 10) and the GPS antenna 654. In various embodiments, this feature can function as a power savings mode. In various embodiments, the first registered state and/or first signal produce by the Hall Effect switch can be received and/or detected by other components as well as operated upon by one or more sets of computer executable instructions to cause the PDA to automatically transition to one or more PDA functions available on PDA 600. For example, upon registering a first state and/or producing a first signal from the Hall Effect switch, the PDA 600 can in various embodiments automatically transition to a calendar function, a to-do list function, and/or an address book function, among others. In various embodiments, the first state and/or first signal can cause the PDA 600 to transition to a pre-defined and/or pre-selected interface for one or more PDA functions. The invention, however, is not limited to the aspects and features presented above.",
        "In a similar manner, in various embodiments by way of example and not by way of limitation, when the subhousing is positioned in one or more second positions (as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4), a second registered state and/or second signal produced by the Hall Effect switch embodiment of FIG. 6 can function to provide power to a GPS receiver (e.g. as described in connection with FIG. 10) and the GPS antenna 654. In various embodiments, this feature can function as a power savings mode to provide power to the GPS receiver and antenna combination only when they are intended for use. In various embodiments, the second registered state and/or second signal produce by the Hall Effect switch can be received and/or detected by other components as well as operated upon by one or more sets of computer executable instructions to cause the PDA 600 to automatically transition to one or more navigation functions available on PDA 600. For example, upon registering a second state and/or producing a second signal from the Hall Effect switch, the PDA 600 can in various embodiments automatically transition to a routing function, a locating function, and/or a tracking function, among others. In various embodiments, the second state and/or second signal can cause the PDA 600 to transition to a pre-defined and/or pre-selected interface for one or more navigation functions. The invention, however, is similarly not limited to the aspects and features presented above. As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate upon reading this disclosure, a detection mechanism, whether a Hall Effect switch or otherwise, is included in various embodiments of the present invention to activate one or more hardware and/or software components of the PDA 600 as the same are described herein.",
        "In various embodiments, in addition to enabling software, a microprocessor (as discussed in connection with FIG. 10) can remember selected preferences of a user. For example, the user may use a specific graphical user interface more often than other graphical user interfaces available for the software component of the navigational component of the PDA 600. The scope of the embodiments of the invention provide for operating systems which can run several software applications simultaneously, e.g. so that the software that is not primarily being used at the time on the PDA 600 can run in the background rather than being totally turned off or not run. In various embodiments, a feature of automatically switching to the software application that is most likely to be used makes for very simple operation. In embodiments with a position detection mechanism, such as described in the embodiment of FIG. 6, a state and/or signal can indicate which particular function is most likely to be used and software applications can be switched automatically so that a user does not have to be involved with switching the software functions and selecting new graphical user interfaces.",
        "FIG. 7 is a cross-sectional view of a portion of the housing 718 and subhousing 714 which includes the patch antenna 714 associated with the hand-held, multi-functional electronic device 710. FIG. 7 is a cross section along line 7-7 in FIG. 5. FIG. 7 provides further detail of the hinge 700. The hinge mechanism 700 includes a spring 710 and a first spring loaded detent 720 and a second spring loaded detent 722. Associated with each spring loaded detent 720, 722, is a cam follower 730, 732. The hinge 700 also includes a first end piece 740 and a second end piece 742 which engages openings within the housing 718.",
        "FIG. 8 shows further detail of one side of the hinge 800 which corresponds to a blown-up portion shown in FIG. 7. FIG. 8 will be used to further detail the hinge mechanism 800. One side of the hinge 800 will be discussed. Specifically, the side of hinge shown in FIG. 8 will be discussed, and it should be noted that the other side of the hinge 800 is similar. Rather than discuss both sides of the hinge 800, one side is discussed for the sake of clarity. The spring loaded detent 820 includes a first end 824 and a second end 826. The second end includes a shoulder 827, as well as a cam 828. The second end 826, shoulder 827, and cam 828 engage the cam follower 830. The cam follower 830, in turn, engages the end 840 of the hinge 800, which engages the housing 818. The spring 810 fits over the first end 824 of the spring loaded detent 820. The spring is positioned to produce a force at both ends of the hinge. The force acts through the spring loaded detent 820, the cam follower 830, and the end piece 840 so as to produce a force at the opening 842 in the housing 818. Therefore, the spring produces a compressive force which forces the end of the hinge 840 into the opening 842. The spring produces a friction force at the end 840 that rotates within the opening 842 of the housing. This is very advantageous to have the hinge 800 be spring loaded using the spring 810. This spring loading provides a compressive force between the hinge 800 and specifically the end 840, and the housing 818, and specifically the opening 842 within the housing. This is particularly significant when the portable hand-held device is being used in an environment that has vibration. One such environment that may be prone to having vibration is within a car. Older cars may vibrate or even newer cars may pass over terrain that imparts vibration to the interior surface of the car. One such terrain might be a washboard surface on a gravel road or chuck holes in the road or any number of road irregularities. The spring 810 of the hinge 800 produces a force to keep the hinge 800 at a specific location. The spring 810 imparts a force so that there is friction between the end 840 and the opening 842 within the housing 818. The friction produces a force which resists movement of the subhousing (as described above in FIG. 6) with respect to the housing 818, especially in environments that might have vibration. The hinge 800, and specifically the spring loaded detent 820, includes a cam surface 828. The cam surface 828 includes a couple of lobes with detents therein.",
        "Yet another feature of the hinge 800 is the fact that it includes a hollow opening within the hinge. The hollow opening is sized so that a connector between an antenna (as shown in FIG. 6) located inside of the housing 818 can pass through the opening within the hinge 800. This provides for a much cleaner design which is less prone to failure since the connector or cable needed to connect the antenna with the hardware within the housing 818 is not exposed. Not only is the design cleaner, but it also provides for a more reliable and robust design since the user is not able, or less able, to inadvertently damage this connector. In various embodiments, the connector can include a coaxial cable connector.",
        "FIG. 9 illustrates an embodiment of a cam 900 taken along cut-line 9-9 in FIG. 8. The invention is not limited to the cam 900 embodiment shown in FIG. 9. Various embodiments include any cam member, associated with a hinge between a housing and a subhousing containing a GPS antenna according to the various embodiments, which is operable to cause a pivotally attached subhousing to tend toward one or more particular positions including the first position and the one or more second positions as the same have been described herein.",
        "As shown in the embodiment of FIG. 9, the cam 900 includes a cam surface 927 operable in association with a spring-loaded detent, as described in FIG. 8 or otherwise, to engage a cam follower. The cam surface 927 includes a first detent 910 and a second detent 920. The first detent 910 is positioned so that the subhousing as it is rotated with respect to the housing will stop in a first position, which is approximately 110\u00b0 from the backside surface of the multi-functional device. FIG. 3 shows the subhousing in such a position with respect to the housing. The second detent 920 will tend to position the subhousing 940 at a position which is essentially 180 0 from the stowed position, as shown in FIG. 4. The detents 910, 920 are helpful in that they provide for preferred open positions of the subhousing with respect to the housing. The detents 910 and 920 are selected so that the patch antenna within the subhousing will be in a preferred orientation in a certain unit so that it will maximize reception of signals from various satellites associated with a GPS system. Although only two detents 910, 920 are shown, it should be noted that more detents could be used if there were other positions of the subhousing with respect to the housing that may be preferred.",

        "Of course it is readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that any programming methodology, programming language, programming interface, operating system, or computing environment, now known or hereafter developed can be readily deployed, without departing from the tenets of the present invention and all such implementation specific embodiments are intended to fall within the broad scope of the present invention.",
        "FIGS. 12A and 12B provide additional illustrative examples of hardware components for a portable, hand-held, multifunction device that includes a navigational capability according to the teachings of the present invention. It should be appreciated that other suitable designs for a hardware device would also be within the scope of the present invention.",
        "FIGS. 12A and 12B provide exploded views of a portion of the housing 1218 and subhousing 1214 which includes the patch antenna 1201 associated with the hand-held portable global positioning device 1200. The subhousing 1214 is pivotally attached to the housing 1218 through an actuator 1203 that can be used to release and move the subhousing 1214 in a \u201cflip-open\u201d fashion. This \u201cflip-open\u201d aspect of the actuator 1203 includes a mechanical linkage 1205 for controlling the movement and position of the subhousing 1214 relative the housing 1218.",
        "Different portions of the actuator 1203 are integrated into, and work in conjunction with, the mechanical linkage 1205, the housing 1218, and the subhousing 1214 to control the movement of the subhousing 1214 relative the housing 1218. As illustrated in FIGS. 12A and 12B, the actuator 1203 can be used to release the subhousing 1214 from its stowed position from the cavity 1252 in a back wall of the housing 1218 (FIG. 12A) into a released position (FIG. 12B). This movement is accomplished through the actuator 1203, and in particular the mechanical linkage 1205, as will be described in greater detail below.",
        "In one embodiment, the portions of the actuator 1203 integrated into and working with the housing 1218 and subhousing 1214 include a release lever 1207. The release level 1207 has a contact surface 1209, a latch 1211, and an elongate shaft 1213 connecting the latch 1211 and the contact surface 1209. As illustrated, the contact surface 1209 can be positioned within and accessible through an opening 1215 in the housing 1218. For example, the back surface 1250 of the housing 1218 can provide the opening 1215. The opening 1215 could also be positioned along a side surface 1217 of the housing 1218. Alternatively, at least a portion of the back surface 1250 and the side surface 1217 of the housing 1218 can provide the opening 1215. Regardless of its position, the release lever 1207 is at least partially accessible (e.g., the contact surface 1209) through the opening 1215 in the housing 1218.",
        "As illustrated, the contact surface 1209 is accessible through the opening 1215 with the latch 1211 and the elongate shaft 1213 positioned within the housing 1218. The contact surface 1209 can move within the opening 1215 to allow the user to engage or disengage the latch 1211 that holds the subhousing 1214 in the stowed position. For example, the release lever 1207 can slide adjacent and parallel to the back surface 1250 within the opening 1215 to engage or disengage the latch 1211 releasably holding the subhousing 1214 in the stowed position.",
        "The subhousing 1214 further includes a surface 1219 that provides a latch face 1221 to engage and disengage the latch 1211 of the release lever 1207. As will be appreciated, the latch 1211 and the latch face 1221 can have a number of configurations so long as they are configured to allow the subhousing 1214 to latch in the stowed position and to unlatch so as to allow the subhousing 1214 to move into the released position.",
        "The release lever 1207 further includes retention members 1223 extending from a rear surface 1225 of the release lever 1207. In one embodiment, the retention members 1223 are configured to interlock with guide members 1227 secured within the housing 1218. For example, the retention members 1223 and the guide members 1227 include surface structures that interlock with each other to allow for their relative movement along a plane. In other words, interlocking surface structures on the retention members 1223 and the guide members 1227 engage each other to allow for the release lever 1207 to slide within the opening without disengaging from the housing 1218. For example, the retention member 1223 can include a ridge configured to seat and ride in a channel in the guide member 1227. As will be appreciated, a benefit of the design of the release lever 1207 is that the release lever 1207 can be installed into the housing 1218, as described herein, by sliding the release lever 1207 through the opening 1215 from the outside of the housing 1218 and then \u201csnapping\u201d the release lever 1207 into place without the need for additional fasteners or extra parts.",
        "As illustrated, the retention members 1223 extend from the rear face 1225 of the release lever 1207. Similarly, the guide members 1227 extend from the housing 1218. In coupling the release lever 1207 to the housing 1218 the retention members 1223 are aligned with the guide members 1227 so that when pressure is applied between the release lever 1207 and the housing 1218 the retention members 1223 and/or the guide members 1227 flex to allow the surfaces to pass each other until the surface structures engage to fasten the release lever 1207 to the housing 1218. Once fastened, the retention members 1223 and the guide members 1227 help to guide the travel of the release lever 1207 as it slides within the opening 1215 to engage or disengage the latch 1211.",
        "The release level 1207 further includes a spring post 1229 extending from the elongate shaft 1213 and a spring 1231. As illustrated, the spring 1231 is located between an internal surface of the housing 1218 and the elongate shaft 1213 of the release lever 1207. In this position the spring 1231 urges the latch 1211 to maintain a latching position relative the latch face 1221. As will be appreciated, as the subhousing 1214 is moved into its stored position, the spring 1231 can resiliently compresses as the latch face 1221 of subhousing 1214 contacts, slides over and engages the latch 1211. To move the subhousing into its released position, the user can slide the contact surface 1209 within the opening 1215 to move the release lever into a release position where the latch 1211 disengages from the subhousing 1214. The spring 1231 can then return the contact surface 1209 and the latch 1211 back to their latching position relative the latch face 1221.",
        "In one embodiment, the release lever 1207 can include a support member 1233 associated with the latch 1211. The support member 1233 can assist in preventing the latch 1211 from deflecting into a position that will not allow the latch face 1221 of subhousing 1214 to engage and latch with the latch 1211 to achieve the stowed position. In other words, the support member 1233 helps to keep the latch 1211 and the latch face 1221 aligned as the subhousing 1214 engages and latches with the housing 1218. As illustrated, the support member 1233 can be positioned between the latch 1211 and a surface within the housing 1218. As will be appreciated, the support member 1233 can either be attached, or integral, to the latch 1211 or attached within the housing 1214.",
        "FIGS. 12A and 12B further show an embodiment of the mechanical linkage 1205 for controlling the movement and position of the subhousing 1214 relative the housing 1218. As discussed herein, the release lever 1207 can be used to release the subhousing 1214 from the stowed position (FIG. 12A) so it can move to its released position (FIG. 12B). In one embodiment, the structure of the mechanical linkage 1205 provides the rotational force to \u201cflip-open\u201d the subhousing 1214 into its released position.",
        "As illustrated, the mechanical linkage 1203 pivotally attaches the housing 1218 and the subhousing 1214, where the mechanical linkage 1203 includes a cam mechanism 1235 to move the subhousing 1214 from the stowed position to the released position. As illustrated, the mechanical linkage 1203 provides a pivot point 1237 around which the subhousing 1214 travels outwardly and upwardly in an arc like fashion from the back surface 1250 of the housing 1218.",
        "The cam mechanism 1235 includes a first cam 1245 and a second cam 1247, where the first and second cams 1245 and 1247 interact to direct the subhousing 1214 into one or more predetermined positions. In the present embodiment, the first cam 1245 includes a surface 1249 having detents 1251. The second cam 1247 also includes a surface 1253 having detents 1255, where the surfaces 1249 and 1253 can move between a seated relationship to an un-seated relationship when the subhousing 1214 is moved relative the housing 1218.",
        "In one embodiment, the seated relationship of the detents 1251 and 1255 on the surfaces 1249 and 1253 define a number of predetermined positions for the subhousing 1214 relative the housing 128. For example, in the stowed position the detents 1251 and 1255 on the surfaces 1249 and 1253 are in an unseated relationship such that the cam mechanism 1235 urges the subhousing 1214 towards its released position. Once in its released position, the subhousing 1214 can be rotated into other predetermined position defined by the different seated relationship of the detents 1251 and 1255 on the surfaces 1249 and 1253. For example, the detents 1251 and 1255 on the surfaces 1249 and 1253 can allow for the subhousing 1214 to be at a fifty six (56), a one hundred one (101), or a one hundred forty six (146) degree position relative the housing 1218 when the detents 1251 and 1255 on the surfaces 1249 and 1253 are in one of their seated relationships.",
        "In addition, the subhousing 1214 can also be positioned at a one hundred eighty (180) degree position relative the housing 1218. In one embodiment, a physical stop prevents the subhousing 1214 from moving beyond the one hundred eighty (180) degree relative position even though the detents 1251 and 1255 on the surfaces 1249 and 1253 are in an unseated relationship urging the subhousing 1214 beyond the one hundred eighty (180) degree relative position. In one embodiment, the physical stop can include the subhousing 1214 physically contacting the housing 1218 at the one hundred eighty (180) degree relative position thereby preventing further rotation there beyond. As illustrated, the first cam 1245 is associated with the housing 1218. In one embodiment, the first cam 1245 can be formed as a portion of the housing 1218. In other words, the first cam 1245 is formed as an integral part of the housing 1218. In an alternative embodiment, the first cam 1245 can be a separate part that is placed within a socket of the housing 1218 that is configured to receive the cam 1245. With respect to this later configuration, both the first cam 1245 and the socket to receive the cam 1245 include one or more surfaces, such as a key, to prevent the first cam 1245 from rotating within the socket of the housing 1218.",
        "The cam mechanism 1241 further includes a spring 1257 and a spring housing 1259 having a sleeve 1261 to receive the spring 1257. The spring housing 1259 is coupled to the second cam 1247. For example, the spring housing 1259 and the second cam 1247 can be formed from a single molded piece of material (e.g., a thermoplastic). The spring housing 1259 and the second cam 1247 can also be joined by a connector, such as a pin or an adhesive (e.g., chemical adhesive or thermal boding).",
        "The spring housing 1259 is at least partially positioned within a socket 1269 of the subhousing 1214. In the present example, the spring housing 1259 and the second cam 1247 are prevented from rotating relative the subhousing 1214 as it moves relative the housing 1218 by the presence of a key 1271 formed by surfaces of the socket 1269 and the spring housing 1259. The spring housing 1259 and the second cam 1247 are, however, free to slide laterally within the socket 1269 as the detents 1251 and 1255 of the cams 1245 and 1247 move between their seated and un-seated positions.",
        "As illustrated, the spring 1257 can be positioned within the sleeve 1261 of the spring housing 1259. When subhousing 1214 has been coupled to the housing 1218, the spring 1257 can be under compression to urge the spring housing 1259, and the second cam 1247 towards the first cam 1245. For example, the spring 1257 can be under compression when the detents 1251 and 1255 of the first and second cams 1245 and 1247 are seated. In the unseated position, the spring 1257 is placed under additional compressive force as the detents 1251 and 1255 unseat moving the spring housing 1259 away from the first cam 1245.",
        "As will be appreciated, the detents 1251 and 1255 on the surfaces 1249 and 1253 can include a number or combination of shapes that can seat and unseat as described herein. For example, the detents 1251 and 1255 can include a serpentine profile having a series of convex and concave surfaces that can seat and unseat as described. As will be appreciated, as the subhousing 1218 is moved into a position that unseats the detents 1251 and 1255 the spring 1257 compresses thereby urging the detents 1251 and 1255 of the cam faces to reseat. Depending upon their relative positions, the detents 1251 and 1255 can urge the first cam 1245 and the second cam 1247 back towards the position from which they were originally seated or to a seated position that provides another of the predetermined positions discussed herein. As will be appreciated, which direction the 1257 spring urges the subhousing 1214 will depend on which half of the detents 1251 and 1255 the cams 1245 and 1247 are unseated on.",
        "The embodiments of the portable global positioning device 1200 further include navigational capabilities (e.g., a navigation component operable to perform one or more navigation functions) operative with the GPS receiver (e.g. as described in connection with FIG. 10), and a detection mechanism 1258 that indicates when the subhousing is in the released position, where the detection mechanism 1258 triggers activation of the navigational capabilities when the subhousing 1214 is in the released position. A display (e.g., FIG. 2) is in communication with the navigational capabilities and the PDA capability so that the navigational capabilities are displayed when the subhousing 1218 is in the released position. In an additional embodiment, the detection mechanism 1258 can also indicate when the subhousing 1218 is in the stowed position, where the detection mechanism 1258 triggers de-activation of the navigational capabilities when the subhousing 1218 is in the stowed position. In one embodiment, the detection mechanism 1258 includes a Hall Effect switch, as discussed herein.",
        "Embodiments of the present invention further include a method of producing the portable global positioning device 1200. For example, the method can include providing PDA components operable to perform one or more PDA functions, as discussed herein, and providing navigation components operable to perform one or more navigation functions, as discussed herein, in the housing 1218. In addition, the GPS patch antenna 1201 can be provided in a subhousing 1214, where the GPS antenna is in communication with the navigation components within the housing 1218. In one embodiment, the GPS patch antenna 1201 can be coupled to the navigation components within the housing 1218 by a lead that passes through an opening in the spring housing 1259 and the housing 1218.",
        "In one embodiment, the housing 1218 and the subhousing 1214 are coupled through the actuator 1203 that controls the movement and position of the subhousing 1218 relative the housing 1214, as discussed herein. In one embodiment, coupling the housing 1218 and the subhousing 1214 includes compressing the second cams 1247 to the surface 1253 of the detents 1255 so that the cams 1247 do not extend beyond the edge of the socket 1269. The subhousing 1214 can then be positioned within the cavity 1252 in the back wall of the housing 1218.",
        "Embodiments of the present invention further include a method of operating the hand-held portable global positioning device 1200 described herein. For example, the method can include uncoupling the latch 1211 that holds the subhousing 1214 in the stowed position to release the subhousing 1214 that is pivotally attach to the housing 1218. The actuator 1203 then mechanically urges the subhousing 1214 from the stowed position into the released position relative the housing 1218 after uncoupling the latch 1211. As described herein, mechanically urging the subhousing includes converting kinetic movement of the spring 1257 into rotational motion of the subhousing relative the housing through the actuator 1203, and in particular the cams 1245 and 1247, joining the subhousing 1214 and the housing 1218. In addition, the method can further include providing the cams 1245 and 1247 of the actuator 1203 with predetermined seated positions (e.g., the seated relationships of the detents 1251 and 1255 discussed herein) for the subhousing 1214 relative the housing 1218.",
        "In summary, disclosed is a multi-function, hand-held portable electronic device including a housing, a processor located within the housing, a memory in communication with the processor, and a display in communication with the processor. The display is positioned on a surface of the housing. The electronic device includes a display in communication with the processor and positioned on a surface of the housing. The electronic device includes an apparatus for performing a first function, and an apparatus for performing a second function. One of the functions includes a navigational component. The navigational component includes an antenna attached to the housing and movable between a stowed position and a signal acquisition position. A detection mechanism indicates the antenna is in the signal acquisition position. An operational component of the navigational component is activated in response to the detection mechanism indicating the antenna is in the signal acquisition position.",
        "The multi-function, portable, hand-held device is also part of a navigational system. The navigation system includes a mass storage device adapted to store navigation data, a server adapted to communicate with the mass storage, and a portable, multi-function electronic device.",
        "The invention provides for a single device having a navigational component and one or more other functions, such as a PDA function or a cellular phone function. The portable, hand-held electronic device is user friendly since one function switches to another essentially automatically. The portable, hand-held electronics device includes a power savings mode so that the user is not continually recharging the device rather than using it. The device is small enough that it is handy to use and stores in a pocket or purse. The device includes a GPS or other navigational device with other devices. The GPS antenna is low profile and is positionable to more than one position so that the device can operate in a hand-held orientation or in a car-mounted orientation. The device is durable, and free of wires routed externally about the housing. Routing the connector between the antenna and hardware within the case provides for a neat, uncluttered design.",
        "The above systems, devices and methods have been described, by way of example and not by way of limitation, with respect to reducing memory capacity requirements, increasing processor throughput, and improving overall ease of user interaction with a navigation device. That is, the systems, devices, functional data, and methods provide for generating a projected route in connection with a navigational device which is more efficient and accurate than current systems, devices, and methods, without requiring more expensive system resources. The systems, devices, functional data, and methods of the present invention offer an improved generated projected route which provide more understandable, accurate and timely capabilities in a navigation device while utilizing less resources.",
