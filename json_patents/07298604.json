    "abstract": "A multilayer capacitor includes a multilayer body in which dielectric layers and inner electrodes are alternately laminated, and terminal electrodes formed on the multilayer body. The inner electrodes include first inner electrodes and second inner electrodes alternately arranged. The terminal electrodes include at least three terminal electrodes. The first inner electrodes are electrically connected to each other via a through-hole conductor. The second inner electrodes are electrically connected to each other via a through-hole conductor. At least two first inner electrodes in the first inner electrodes are electrically connected via a lead conductor to at least two respective terminal electrodes whose number is smaller than the total number of the terminal electrodes by at least 1 in the at least three terminal electrodes. At least one second inner electrode in the second inner electrodes is electrically connected via a lead conductor to the remainder of terminal electrodes other than the terminal electrodes electrically connected to the first inner electrodes via the lead conductor. An equivalent series resistance is set to a desirable value by adjusting the number of at least one species of the first and second inner electrodes electrically connected to the terminal electrodes via the lead conductors.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a multilayer capacitor and a method of adjusting an equivalent series resistance of a multilayer capacitor.",
        "2. Related Background Art",
        "Known as this kind of multilayer capacitor is one comprising a multilayer body in which a plurality of dielectric layers and a plurality of inner electrodes are alternately laminated, and a plurality of terminal electrodes formed on the multilayer body (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 2001-185441 and 2004-47983).",
        "Power supplies for central processing units (CPUs) mounted in digital electronic devices have been increasing their load current while lowering their voltage. Therefore, it has become quite difficult to suppress the fluctuation in power supply voltage under a tolerable level in response to a drastic change in load current, whereby a multilayer capacitor known as decoupling capacitor has come into connection with a power supply as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 2001-185441. At the time when the load current fluctuates transiently, the multilayer capacitor supplies a current to the CPU, thereby suppressing the fluctuation of the power supply voltage.",
        "In recent years, as the CPUs have further been raising their operating frequencies, the load current has been becoming faster and greater. Therefore, the multilayer capacitor used in the decoupling capacitor is demanded to increase its capacity and equivalent series resistance (ESR). The multilayer capacitor disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-47983 employs a terminal electrode having a multilayer structure including an inner resistance layer, thereby increasing the ESR.",
        "However, the following problem exists in the multilayer capacitor disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-47983 when adjusting the equivalent series resistance to a desirable value. Namely, for adjusting the equivalent series resistance to a desirable value, the multilayer capacitor disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-47983 must regulate the thickness of the inner resistance layer included in the terminal electrode and the material composition of the inner resistance layer, which makes it quite difficult to control the equivalent series resistance.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide a multilayer capacitor and a method of adjusting an equivalent series resistance of a multilayer capacitor, which can regulate the equivalent series resistance easily with a high precision.",
        "In a typical multilayer capacitor, all the inner electrodes are connected to their corresponding terminal electrodes via lead conductors. Consequently, the lead conductors exist by the number of inner electrodes, thereby lowering the equivalent series resistance. As the number of layers of the dielectric layers and inner electrodes is made greater in order to increase the capacity of the multilayer capacitor, the number of lead conductors becomes greater. Since resistance components of lead conductors are connected to the terminal electrodes in parallel, the equivalent series resistance of the multilayer capacitor further decreases as the number of lead conductors increases. Thus, the demand for increasing the capacity of the capacitor and the demand for increasing the equivalent series resistance contradict each other.",
        "Therefore, the inventors diligently conducted studies about multilayer capacitors which can satisfy both of the demands for increasing the capacity and equivalent series resistance. As a result, the inventors have found a new fact that, even when the number of dielectric layers and the number of laminated inner electrodes are the same, the equivalent series resistance can be adjusted to a desirable value if the inner electrodes are connected to each other with a through-hole conductor while making it possible to change the number of lead conductors. The inventors have also found a new fact that the equivalent series resistance can be adjusted to a desirable value if the inner electrodes are connected to each other with a through-hole conductor while making it possible to change positions of lead conductors in the laminating direction of the multilayer body. When the number of lead conductors is made smaller than that of inner electrodes in particular, the adjustment can be made such as to increase the equivalent series resistance.",
        "In view of such results of studies, in one aspect, the present invention provides a multilayer capacitor comprising a multilayer body in which a plurality of dielectric layers and a plurality of inner electrodes are alternately laminated, and a plurality of terminal electrodes formed on the multilayer body; wherein the plurality of inner electrodes include a plurality of first inner electrodes and a plurality of second inner electrodes alternately arranged; wherein the plurality of terminal electrodes include at least three terminal electrodes; wherein the plurality of first inner electrodes are electrically connected to each other via a through-hole conductor; wherein the plurality of second inner electrodes are electrically connected to each other via a through-hole conductor; wherein at least two first inner electrodes in the plurality of first inner electrodes are electrically connected via a lead conductor to at least two respective terminal electrodes whose number is smaller than the total number of the terminal electrodes by at least 1 in the at least three terminal electrodes; wherein at least one second inner electrode in the plurality of second inner electrodes is electrically connected via a lead conductor to the remainder of terminal electrodes other than the terminal electrodes electrically connected to the first inner electrodes via the lead conductor; and wherein an equivalent series resistance is set to a desirable value by adjusting the number of at least one species of the first and second inner electrodes electrically connected to the terminal electrodes via the lead conductors.",
