        "This is a continuation-in-part application of a patent application Ser. No. 10/091,474 filed on Mar. 7, 2002 now abandoned.",
        "The present invention relates to a clear paint for golf balls which can form a coated surface having excellent stain resistance, excellent scuff resistance and low surface friction coefficient, i.e. high sliding property, and to a golf ball of which exterior is coated with the above clear paint.",
        "From the structural point of view, golf balls are generally classified into two categories: wound golf balls and solid golf balls. The wound golf balls have a rubber core containing some liquid, rubber yarn wound around the core being stretched about ten times, and a cover thereon. The solid golf balls are hard rubber solid spheres. There are solid golf balls of one-piece type and of two-piece type.",
        "For any golf ball, the top surfaces of materials are coated with paint layer. This paint layer generally has a double layer structure which consists of a white painting layer and a clear painting layer such that the clear painting layer forms the top layer of a golf ball. Conventionally, the clear painting layer is formed by applying a clear paint of urethane resin series.",
        "Such paint layer is required to have various characteristics. A paint layer for a golf ball is required to have excellent toughness for withstanding strong impact produced by hitting with a club face and also to have flexibility for following the deformation of the ball caused by the impact. When the ball falls down on the ground, the ball is strongly abraded with grasses, mud, fine gravels, and the like because the ball rotates. This leads to the following phenomenon that the gloss of the ball is reduced by such abrasion, that the mud enters into flaws produced therein, and that the ball is contaminated with grass axil. Nowadays, golf balls are desired to retain their white appearance and their gloss even after used. Therefore, paint layers for golf balls are desired to have excellent wear resistance and excellent scuff resistance and to be hard to be contaminated so that their white appearance and their gloss are recovered by wiping off mud and grass axil.",
        "However, a conventional golf ball of which top surface is a clear painting layer of urethane resin is remarkably contaminated after used. In particular, oil dirt and grass axil can not be removed even being wiped with a wet dust cloth. Further, since dirt enters into fine flaws produced therein by friction and impacts, the original white appearance and gloss are hardly recovered.",
        "Therefore, there is a need to provide a paint which is flexible and has great elongation and scuff resistance. However, if using such a paint, a resultant ball adversely has high friction on its surface. In a place, such as a driving range, where a large number of golf balls are collected and transported, too large friction may lead to plugging of golf balls in a transporting passage because the balls are in contact with high frictional force. This trouble is so-called blocking phenomenon.",
        "Japanese patent publication H5-269221A discloses a clear paint of urethane series which contains an organic modified polysiloxane including hydroxyl group. By using the clear paint, a resultant golf ball can be provided with a paint layer having good impact resistance and high sliding property. In the above JP H5-269221A, the organic modified polysiloxane including hydroxyl group is concretely polyester modified polysiloxane including hydroxyl group Byk-370 (available from BYK Chemie Japan K.K.).",
        "However, the paint disclosed in JP H5-269221A has following disadvantages.",
        "The organic modified polysiloxane including hydroxyl group exhibiting a role of providing the sliding property can react with the binder resin. Since the organic modified polysiloxane including hydroxyl group has high surface activity, it easily diffuses into the surface and remains on the surface of the paint layer because of its reactivity. Because of such properties of the organic modified polysiloxane including hydroxyl group, the paint disclosed in Japanese patent publication H5-269221A shows sufficient sliding property. However, in driving ranges and the like, golf balls are often in contact with water, such as dipped in cleaning solution for removing dirt and exposed to rain. When the surface of the golf ball is in contact with water, unreacted organic modified polysiloxane including hydroxyl group or relatively low molecular weight resin components (including polysiloxane) may leach out into water, resulting in significant deterioration of sliding property. Particularly, since the organic modified polysiloxane including hydroxyl group easily remains on the surface of coated layer, it easily leaches out into water when dipped in the water. Therefore, the organic modified polysiloxane including hydroxyl group is lost due to the leaching so that the effect of the sliding property can not be maintained for a long period of time.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide a golf ball having a clear paint layer formed thereon, wherein the paint layer has excellent scuff resistance, is hardly contaminated so that dirt on the ball can be easily wiped off, has low friction factor on its surface, thus excellent sliding property, and is capable of persisting its sliding property for a long period of time.",
        "A clear paint for golf balls of a first aspect of the invention contains a modified silicone oil having two or more hydroxyl groups at one terminal end.",
        "In the modified silicone oil having two or more hydroxyl groups at one terminal end, its backbone chain (principal chain or main chain) such as polydimethylsiloxane has characteristics as a silicone oil, thus improving the sliding property and the stain resistance of the resultant paint layer.",
        "To persist the sliding property and the stain resistance exhibited by the silicone oil added in the clear paint, it is necessary to incorporate the silicone oil into the cross-linking structure of the base polymer of the clear paint in the stable state, to prevent the reduction in cross-linking density due to addition of the silicone oil, and to prevent the silicone oil from being segregated and thus exposed to the surface of the resultant paint layer (clear paint layer).",
        "The base polymer of the clear paint for golf balls generally is urethane resin which is made of polyester polyol and isocyanate. The modified silicone oil having two or more hydroxyl groups at one terminal used in the first aspect can effectively react with isocyanate so that it is easily incorporated into the three-dimensional structure of urethane resin as the base polymer, thereby stably existing in the resultant paint layer. Therefore, according to the first aspect, unlike the organic modified polysiloxane including hydroxyl group disclosed in JP H5-269221A which includes many unreacted components and is thus easily segregated and exposed to the surface, the modified silicone oil is not lost even when subjected to abrasion and washed, thereby enabling to maintain the sliding property of the surface for a long period of time.",
        "A clear paint for golf balls of a second aspect contains a graft polymer.",
        "The graft polymer has a high molecular backbone chain and branched chains bonded to the backbone chain, wherein components of the branched chains are different from the component of the backbone chain, thus improving the sliding property and the stain resistance of the resultant paint layer.",
        "To persist the sliding property and the stain resistance exhibited by the components added in the clear paint, it is necessary to incorporate the components into the cross-linking structure of the base polymer of the clear paint in the stable state, and to prevent them from being segregated and thus exposed to the surface of the resultant paint layer (clear paint layer).",
        "The base polymer of the clear paint for golf balls generally is urethane resin which is made of polyester polyol and isocyanate. The graft polymer used in the second aspect has excellent compatibility with the base polymer because of its backbone. Particularly in case that the backbone has hydroxyl group, the hydroxyl group can effectively react with isocyanate so that the graft polymer is easily incorporated into the three-dimensional structure of urethane resin as the base polymer, thereby stably existing in the resultant paint layer. Therefore, according to the second aspect, unlike the organic modified polysiloxane including hydroxyl group disclosed in JP H5-269221A which includes many unreacted components and is thus easily segregated and exposed to the surface, the graft polymer is not lost even when subjected to abrasion and washed, thereby enabling to maintain the sliding property of the surface for a long period of time.",
        "A golf ball of the present invention is characterized in that its surface is coated with the clear paint for golf balls of the present invention as mentioned above, and has excellent scuff resistance, is hardly contaminated so that dirt can be easily wiped off, further has excellent sliding property, and is capable of persisting its sliding property for a long period of time.",
        "Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail.",
        "First, description will be made as regard to modified silicone oil to be added in a clear paint of a first aspect.

The acrylic resin is preferably an acrylic resin having at least one hydroxyl group at a terminal end or a branch.",
        "According to the graft polymer as mentioned above, the backbones thereof such as the acrylic resin improve the compatibility with the base polymer of the clear paint. The branches such as the polydimethylsiloxane have properties as silicone oil, thus improving the sliding property and the stain resistance of the coating layer.",
        "The comb polymer is preferably prepared by radical copolymerization of a macromonomer, of which one terminal is an acrylic group and/or a methacryl group and the backbone chain is polydimethylsiloxane, as represented by the following general formula (5) with an acrylic monomer such as methyl methacrylate or methyl acrylate.",

        "When the ratio of the modified silicone oil or the graft polymer is lower than the range as mentioned above, the effects for improving the properties such as the sliding property which will be obtained by adding the modified silicone oil or the graft polymer can not be sufficiently obtained. When the ratio is higher than the range as mentioned above, the adhesion to the base is poor. It is preferable that the modified silicone oil or the graft polymer is added to a polyol component which is the raw material component of the polyurethane resin as its base polymer in such a manner that the ratio thereof is in the aforementioned range.",
