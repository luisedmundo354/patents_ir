        "The present invention generally relates to inorganic solid lubricant coatings, and to methods for forming such solid lubricant coatings.",
        "Compliant foil air bearings (hereafter, foil bearings) are at the forefront of oil-free turbomachinery, in which gas turbine engines with hydrodynamic bearings use air instead of oil as the working fluid. Foil bearings have several commercial applications, such as air cycle machines, turbocompressors, and microturbines, as well as aircraft gas turbine engines.",
        "The rotating shaft of a foil bearing may act as an air pump to create a thin layer of high pressure air between the shaft or journal and the top foil. As a result, during normal operation air serves as lubricant for the bearing. To protect the bearing during start-up and shut down, i.e., in the absence of high pressure air between the shaft and top foil, solid lubricants have been used. Such solid lubricants have typically been applied to the top foil, but may also be applied to the shaft.",
        "Prior art solid lubricants for foil bearings have been applied to a substrate (e.g., top foil or shaft) as liquids, for example, by spraying the liquid on the substrate surface, or by dipping the substrate in the liquid. Such liquids of prior art solid lubricants have used organic polymer constituents, as a lubricant per se, or as a binder. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,435,839 (to Gu, et al.) discloses a liquid coating comprising an organic thinning liquid, an organic polyimide binder, and an organic wetting agent; as well as a process for applying the liquid to a substrate by spraying nine (9) sub-coats of the liquid, with a series of intermittent curing steps (one hour in an oven), and intermittent sanding steps.",
        "Foil bearings using conventional organic-based solid lubricants are typically limited to an operating temperature of not more than about 350\u00b0 C., and therefore cooling of the foil bearing components during operation is required. Such cooling consumes fuel and increases both operating cost and weight.",
        "An inorganic solid lubricant was described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,518 (to Dellacorte et al.), which discloses a self-lubricating composite comprising a chromium oxide (e.g., chromic oxide, Cr2O3), a metal binder comprising a Cr/Ni or Cr/Co alloy, a metal fluoride, and, optionally, a metal lubricant. A milled powder mix of the composite is deposited on the substrate by plasma spraying, and the like; or, free-standing bodies of the composite may be formed by cold isostatic pressing or hot isostatic pressing.",
        "As can be seen, there is a need for an inorganic solid lubricant adapted for operating temperatures in excess of those tolerated by organic-based solid lubricants. There is a further need for an inorganic solid lubricant which can be readily and inexpensively applied to a substrate in a simple and straightforward process, such that processing costs are decreased, and productivity is increased. There is also a need for a process for coating superalloy components or other substrates with an inorganic solid lubricant by applying a precursor material to the substrate, wherein the precursor material includes at least one inorganic bonding component, and wherein the inorganic bonding components are melted on the substrate surface, at a temperature insufficient to thermally damage the substrate, whereby the solid lubricant coating is bonded to the substrate surface.",

The at least one inorganic bonding component may be melted in situ on the substrate surface, whereby the solid lubricant coating is bonded to the substrate surface.",

        "In yet another aspect of the present invention, a method for applying a solid lubricant coating to a substrate surface may include applying a first precursor material to the substrate surface, wherein the first precursor material comprises a first plurality of inorganic components and a plurality of organic constituents; removing the plurality of organic constituents from the first precursor material; heating the first plurality of inorganic components to a melt temperature of the first plurality of inorganic components, wherein the first plurality of inorganic components includes at least one eutectic mixture; and bonding the first plurality of inorganic components to the substrate surface to form a first layer of the solid lubricant coating on the substrate surface.",
        "In a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for making a precursor material, the method comprising providing inorganic components of the precursor material, and combining the inorganic components with a polymer binder and a solvent to provide the precursor material.

The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.",
        "Broadly, the present invention provides solid lubricant coatings for use at operating temperatures up to at least about 550\u00b0 C. Solid lubricant coatings of the instant invention may be applied to various substrates, including substrates comprising superalloys, such as nickel-based superalloys. The present invention also provides a method for depositing solid lubricant coatings on a substrate by applying a precursor material to the substrate, e.g., in the form of a paste, and curing the precursor material to form a hard coating of the solid lubricant bonded to the substrate surface.",
        "As an example, the present invention may find applications in foil bearings, e.g., in gas turbine engines, as well as in many other types of components or bearings requiring high temperature lubrication, such as in oil-free bearings and oil-less pumps, and the like.",
        "The present invention differs from the prior art in providing an inorganic solid lubricant coating that may be applied to a substrate as a precursor material, which may be in the form of a paste, using a simple, straightforward, and inexpensive application process, wherein the solid lubricant coating lacks an organic constituent.",
        "In further contrast to the prior art, a process for forming a solid lubricant coating of the present invention on a substrate surface may involve applying a precursor material, and thereafter melting at least one inorganic bonding component of the precursor material to bond the solid lubricant coating to the substrate surface.",
        "In still further contrast to the prior art, a process for forming a solid lubricant coating, according to one embodiment of the present invention, may involve sequentially applying two or more precursor materials to a substrate surface, wherein the resultant solid lubricant coating formed on the substrate comprises two or more solid lubricant layers having the same or different compositions.",
        "FIG. 1 is a block diagram schematically representing an aircraft 10, according to one embodiment of the invention. Aircraft 10 may include one or more gas turbine engines 20. Each gas turbine engine 20 may include one or more foil bearings 30 (see FIG. 2A).

During operation, rotating shaft 32 may act as an air pump to create a layer of high-pressure air (not shown) between top foil 34 and shaft 32, such that the layer of air serves as lubricant. At start up and shut down, i.e., in the absence of the air layer, foil bearing 30 may be protected by a solid lubricant. In particular, and according to one aspect of the present invention, foil bearing 30 may be protected by solid lubricant coating 40 (see for example, FIGS. 2B, 3, 4-7). Solid lubricant coating 40 is omitted from FIG. 2A for the sake of clarity. One or more bump foils (not shown), disposed between top foil 34 and bearing sleeve 36, may serve both as a spring, to tailor bearing compliance, and to minimize leakage of the air layer. Bump foil(s) of foil bearing 30 are omitted from FIG. 2A for the sake of clarity. Foil bearings, in general, are known in the art.",

Accordingly, solid lubricant coating 40 may comprise one or more wear-resistant components and one or more friction-lowering components (as described hereinbelow). The one or more wear-resistant components and the one or more friction-lowering components may be separate components of solid lubricant coating 40.

In this manner, at least one bonding component of the precursor material may bond the inorganic components of the precursor material to the substrate surface and to each other. As a result, solid lubricant coating 40 is formed on, and bonded to, the substrate surface.",
