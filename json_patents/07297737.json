        "This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/494,684, filed Aug. 13, 2003.",
        "The present invention relates to a process for producing highly plasticized polyamide blends containing additional additives such as tougheners and/or fillers.",
        "It is well known that tougheners such as grafted rubbers or ionic polymers can be employed to improve the toughness of polyamides; see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,174,358 and 3,845,163. It is also well known that plasticizers can be incorporated into polyamide blends to decrease their stiffness. N-butylbenzenesulfonamide (hereinafter BBSA) is an example of a well-known, effective plasticizer for polyamides; see, for example, Kohan, M. I. Ed. Nylon Plastics Handbook, Hanser: Munich, 1995; p. 365. Plasticized, toughened polyamide compositions such as ZYTEL\u00ae 350PHS2 NC010, manufactured by E.I. du Pont de Nemours, have been available for a number of years. Such resins are useful, for example, as jacketing for cables. However, while pipes and tubing can be made from such materials, it would be desirable to have available resins for making polyamide-containing pipes and tubing that possessed a lower flexural modulus, as such pipes and tubing would have great flexibility.",
        "One method for lowering the flexural modulus would be to introduce higher levels of plasticizer to the polyamide composition. Thermoplastic polyamides are solids that are most efficiently blended on a molecular level with other materials by melting the polyamide in a suitable melt-processing apparatus such as an extruder and adding the additional materials to the molten polyamide and thoroughly mixing the resulting blend. When the blend is allowed to cool, the additional materials will be uniformly dispersed throughout the polyamide. As a result of high temperatures required for the melt-processing of polyamides, this method is not effective when large amounts of a volatile material must be added to the polyamide, as a significant portion of the volatile materials will be lost through the atmospheric pressure or vacuum vent port of the extruder. This requires that large excesses of the volatile material be added to the extruder to compensate for these losses, increasing the expense and complexity of the process.",
        "Plasticized polyamide compositions are typically prepared by compounding the polyamide and other desired ingredients with the plasticizer in an extruder. However, because polyamide plasticizers are typically volatile relative to polyamides at the temperatures required to compound polyamides, it is difficult to incorporate large amounts of plasticizer using this method. For example, polyamide 6,12, a relatively low-melting polyamide, has a melting point of about 214\u00b0 C. and BBSA has a boiling point of 340\u00b0 C. Since it is necessary to compound polymers at temperatures well above their melting point, polyamide 6,12 is compounded at temperatures at which BBSA has a significant vapor pressure, and a significant portion of the BBSA introduced to the extruder would be lost through the vent port during compounding, making it impossible or very inefficient to achieve high loadings of BBSA. Other polyamides having higher melting points are compounded at even higher temperatures and will experience correspondingly higher losses of plasticizer. Plasticizers may be incorporated into polyamides during the polymerization process, but it is not practical or in some cases possible to incorporate additives such as tougheners or fibers or fillers during polymerization.",
        "Higher molecular weight, less volatile plasticizers are available but they are not as efficient as BBSA, requiring even higher additive amounts. This negatively impacts other properties, such as tensile strength. Additionally, it is often desirable that plasticized polyamide resin compositions have a polyamide component with a high average molecular weight, and hence high melt and solution viscosity. Such compositions are often used for extrusion processes that form pipes, tubing, sheeting, etc where a high melt viscosity is desirable. When high molecular weight polyamides are passed through an extruder or otherwise melt-processed to incorporate other desired ingredients, however, these polyamides often are reduced in molecular weight, particularly when moisture is present in the polyamide, other ingredients, or extruder or other melt-processing equipment. Thus it is desirable to have a process that allows for the preparation of highly plasticized polyamides with a high average molecular that also contain additives. Such a process has been heretofore unknown and though they have long been desired, highly plasticized, high average molecular weight polyamides containing additives such as tougheners, reinforcing agents, and fillers are commercially unavailable, due to the difficulties that have been encountered when attempting to add both such additives and plasticizers to polyamides while efficiently using conventional melt-processing methods. These difficulties have been particularly acute when it is also necessary to maintain the molecular weight of high average molecular weight polyamides during the incorporation of plasticizer and additives.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide an efficient process for producing a highly plasticized polyamide composition containing additives. It is a feature of the present invention to produce highly plasticized polyamide compositions containing additives such as tougheners and fillers. It is an advantage of the present invention to produce highly plasticized polyamide compositions containing additives wherein the polyamide has a high average molecular weight.",

An aqueous polyamide 6,12 salt solution (2571 kg), prepared from hexamethylenediamine and dodecanedioic acid in water, with a pH of about 7.6 and a salt concentration of 45%, was charged into an evaporator. An aqueous solution containing 10 weight percent antifoam agent (250 g), hexamethylenediamine (4000 g), and N-butylbenzensulfonamide (222 kg) were added to the solution in the evaporator, which was then concentrated by increasing the temperature to 134\u00b0 C. and allowing the pressure to rise to 35 psia. The concentrated solution was then charged into an autoclave along with 82 g of aqueous 76% phosphoric acid solution. The solution was heating while allowing the pressure to rise to 265 psia. Steam was vented and heating was continued until the temperature of the batch reached 255\u00b0 C. The pressure was then reduced slowly to 18.9 psia, while the batch temperature was held at 235\u00b0 C. Pressure was then lowered to 3 psia while the batch temperature rose to 264\u00b0 C. and was held at that temperature and pressure for 30 minutes. Finally, the polymer melt was extruded into strands, cooled, cut into pellets, and dried at 160\u00b0 C. under nitrogen.",

This blend was introduced to the rear barrel of a ten-barrel 57 mm Werner & Pfleiderer twin-screw extruder at a rate of 65.48 lb/hr using a loss-in-weight feeder. The anhydride-functionalized EPDM toughener was also added to the rear barrel at a rate of 25.27 lb/hr using an additional loss-in-weight feeder. Polyamide 6,12 was also introduced to the sixth barrel from the rear of the extruder at a rate of 58.8 lb/hr using a loss-in weight feeder and a side feeder.",
        "The extruder was operated at a screw rpm of 250, and vacuum of about 0.47-0.51 bar was applied at barrel 9.

The polymer strands coming from the extruder were quenched in water and fed to a cutter. The hot pellets were collected in a vessel that was continuously swept with nitrogen gas to avoid moisture absorption from the air.",
        "Pellets of component (A) (5.9 kg) and component (B) (3.2 kg) were combined in a drum and cube-blended by tumbling the drum at room temperature. The moisture in the pellets of the resulting cube blend was adjusted to between 0.1 weight percent and 0.2 weight percent by drying or adding additional water as required. Test bars were molded from the cube blend in an injection molding machine according to ISO methods. The molded bars were tested in their dry-as-molded state using ISO methods. Inherent viscosity was measured in m-cresol using ASTM 2857. The data are shown in Table 1.",
