        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a conveyance apparatus using movable bodies, which is used to move a movable body for conveying items on a fixed path located on a floor or on a ceiling, for example.",
        "2. Background Art",
        "Conventionally, a conveyance apparatus using movable bodies disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-114094, for example, has been used as this kind of apparatus. More specifically, the main body of a movable body which is able to move along a fixed path by being supported and guided on rails by means of a plurality of guided devices, is formed by three frame members which are connected, by means of a connecting device, in a relatively rotatable fashion in lateral directions traversing the longitudinal travelling direction of the movable body. A supporting section for items to be conveyed is provided on the middle frame, and a group of guided devices are connected, by means of a vertical axle, to the movable body in a relatively rotatable fashion. A plurality of divided rail members capable of supporting the group of guided devices are provided in a set path section within the fixed path, and furthermore, rotating means for causing these divided rail members to rotate about a vertical axis are also provided. Moreover, a group of lateral travel rail members capable of connecting to the divided rail members when the latter are rotated and separated from the rails, are provided to the lateral side of the set path section.",
        "According to this conventional constitution, the respective guided devices of the movable body are supported on the divided rail members, and in this state, the group of divided rail members are connected to the lateral travel rail members by reverse rotation of rotating means. Thereby, the respective guided devices can assume a posture facing sideways in the lateral direction, whilst the main body of the movable body is aligned in a direction following the set path section. By moving the group of guided devices sideways in a lateral direction, the movable body can be moved laterally whilst the main body of the movable body remains in an attitude aligned with the set path section. Consequently, by forming a storage path from a lateral travel path section composed of a group of lateral travel rail members, it is possible to store the movable bodies in such a manner that the main bodies thereof are aligned laterally in parallel.",
        "However, according to the prior art constitution described above, in the lateral travel path section, it is not readily possible to maintain a spacing between movable bodies in the lateral travel direction, and therefore, in order to convey the movable bodies laterally in such a manner that there is no mutual contact between the conveyed items, it has been necessary to separately install lateral conveyance devices, or the like, having a complicated structure.",
        "Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a conveyance apparatus using movable bodies, whereby spacing between movable bodies in the lateral direction can be maintained readily by means of a simple structure, and hence a group of movable bodies can be conveyed in a lateral direction, in such a manner that there is no mutual contact between conveyed items.",
        "In order to achieve the object, the conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to the present invention is a conveyance apparatus using movable bodies in which each movable body is able to move along a fixed path by being supported and guided on a main rail by means of a plurality of guided devices, the main body of the movable body being formed by a plurality of frame members connected in a relatively rotatable fashion in a traverse direction with respect to a longitudinal direction via connecting devices, at least one of the frame members being provided with a supporting section for conveyed items, each of the guided devices being coupled in a relatively rotatable fashion to the movable body by means of vertical axles, characterized in that a plurality of lateral travel rail members are provided on a lateral side of a prescribed region of the fixed path for supporting and guiding the guided devices in such a manner that the frame member provided with the supporting section assumes an orthogonal position with respect to a direction of travel, whilst the other frame members become aligned with the direction of travel, and branching means is provided in the prescribed region for causing the guided devices on the main rail to branch off onto the plurality of lateral travel rail members.",
        "By adopting the foregoing constitution, in linear shaped path sections of the fixed path, the movable body can be moved in such a manner that the main body thereof, in other words, the respective frame members thereof, assume a linear attitude in a plan view. Moreover, in a left or right-hand curved path section, the movable body can be moved in such a manner that the respective frame members thereof assume a curved attitude in accordance with the curved path, also in a plan view, by means of the connecting devices, and in this case, such curvature is achieved by relative rotation of the guided devices about vertical axles. Furthermore, by means of the guided devices rotating about the vertical axles, the movable body can be conveyed smoothly by automatically adjusting the orientation thereof in accordance with the leftward or rightward curvature of the rail.",
        "In this way, by causing the respective guided devices of a movable body to branch off from the main rail and onto lateral travel rail members when the movable body arrives at the prescribed region of the fixed path by being supported and guided on the main rail, it is possible to branch off and convey the movable body in a lateral direction with respect to the fixed path, in a state where the frame member provided with the supporting section is positioned orthogonally with respect to the direction of travel and the other frame members are aligned in the direction of travel. Thereby, it is possible to move movable bodies laterally in a state where a spacing corresponding to the length of the other frame members is maintained therebetween in the lateral travel direction, and this maintenance of the spacing between movable bodies in the lateral travel direction is achieved readily by means of a simple structure, and hence a group of movable bodies can be conveyed laterally in such a manner that there is no mutual contact between conveyed items.",
        "A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to a first aspect of the present invention is such that the main body of the movable body is formed by three frame members, the supporting section being provided on the middle frame member, and a pair of lateral travel rail members are provided in such a manner that the movable body is conveyed laterally in a state wherein the front frame member thereof is aligned with one of the lateral travel rail members, and the rear frame member thereof is bent to be aligned with the other lateral travel rail member.",
        "According to this first aspect, it is possible to branch off and convey a movable body in a lateral direction with respect to the fixed path, in a state where the middle frame member provided with the supporting section assumes an orthogonal position with respect to the direction of travel, whilst the front frame member and rear frame member are bent so as to be aligned with the lateral travel rail members. Thereby, movable bodies can be moved in a lateral direction in a state where a spacing corresponding to the length of the front frame member and the rear frame member is guaranteed therebetween in the lateral travel direction.",
        "A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to a second aspect of the present invention is such that when a plurality of movable bodies are supported and guided on the lateral travel rail members, guided devices of preceding and following movable bodies which are adjacently positioned in the direction of travel can be coupled together.",
        "According to this second aspect, by coupling the guided devices of a movable body which is branched off and conveyed laterally, with the guided devices of the preceding movable body, it is possible thereafter to move a group of movable bodies laterally, in a train-like fashion.",
        "A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to a third aspect of the present invention is such that motional force applying means is provided for applying motional force to a movable body supported on the plurality of lateral travel rail members.",
        "According to this third aspect, it is possible to convey a movable body that has been branched off, in an state wherein the frame member provided with the supporting section can move orthogonally to the direction of travel, by the operation of the motional force applying means.",
        "A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to a fourth aspect of the present invention is such that the region where the lateral travel rail members are provided is formed into a working path section with respect to conveyed items.",
        "According to this fourth aspect, it is possible to maintain spacing between movable bodies in the lateral travel direction, and hence various tasks can be performed readily and accurately with respect to the conveyed items, whilst a group of movable bodies are conveyed laterally in such a manner that there is no mutual contact between the conveyed items.",
        "A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to a fifth aspect of the present invention is such that the movable body is formed with passive surfaces on the side faces of the respective frame members thereof, and feeding means having feed rollers capable of abutting on these passive surfaces is provided in the fixed path.",
        "According to this fifth aspect, by causing forcibly rotated feed rollers to abut on the passive surfaces of the movable body, it is possible to impart a motional force (travelling force) to the movable body by means of rotational feeding force thereof, and hence the movable body can be conveyed readily and reliably.",
        "A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to a sixth aspect of the present invention is such that the branching means comprises a plurality of divided rail members formed by dividing the main rail in the prescribed region and being capable of supporting the guided devices, and rotating devices for causing these divided rail members to rotate about vertical axes.",
        "According to this sixth aspect, by causing the divided rail members to rotate about the vertical axles by operating the rotating devices so as to connect them to the main rail whilst separating them from the lateral travel rail members, it is possible to cause the guided devices of the conveyed movable body to be transferred from the main rail to the group of divided rail members, whereupon the movable object can be halted in a position wherein the guided devices are supported by corresponding divided rail members. Next, the divided rail members can be separated from the main rail and connected with the lateral travel rail members by reverse rotation of the rotating devices, and by means of this rotational force on the divided rail members, the guided devices can be rotated about vertical axles with respect to the main body or a supporting section of the movable body.",
        "Consequently, by moving the guided devices by appropriate lateral feeding means, the guided devices can be transferred from the divided rail members onto the lateral travel rail members. Thereupon, by reverse operation of the rotating means, the divided rail members can be separated from the lateral travel rail members and connected with the main rail, thereby returning the system to the initial state. By an operation of this kind, it is possible to branch off a plurality of guided devices onto a plurality of divided rail members.",
        "A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to a seventh aspect of the present invention is such that the branching means is composed in such a manner that all of the movable bodies arriving at the prescribed region in the fixed path are caused to branch off onto the plurality of lateral travel rail members.",
        "According to this seventh aspect, a movable body arriving at the prescribed region is always transferred to the lateral travel rail members and conveyed laterally, without allowing it to pass through the prescribed region.",
        "A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according an eighth aspect of the present invention is such that the branching means is composed to branch off the movable body in such a manner that the frame members other than the frame member provided with the supporting section assume an orthogonal attitude in a same direction, with respect to the frame member provided with the supporting section.",
        "According to this eighth aspect, the movable body can be conveyed laterally in a U-shaped bent attitude, wherein the other frame members are positioned mutually in parallel, in alignment with the lateral travel rail members, and hence a force for lateral conveyance, and the like, can be applied in a stable fashion by means of these other frame members in parallel alignment.",
        "A conveyance apparatus using movable bodies according to a ninth aspect of the present invention is such that the movable body comprises a supporting section for conveyed items in a lower portion of at least one of the frame members.",
        "According to this ninth aspect, it is possible to convey movable bodies of a suspended conveyance design, laterally, whilst the supporting section thereof retains a horizontal position.",

A link member 64 is installed on the vertical axle 63, and a supporting member 65 is provided on the free end of this link member 64.",
        "An induction motor 66 provided with reduction gears, which is one example of a rotational drive device, is installed on the upper face of the supporting member 65, and a feed roller 68 having an outer circumference portion made from urethane is fixed to an output axle which extends in a downward direction from the induction motor 66. This induction motor 66 is composed so as to impart a feed rotational force A to the feed roller 68.",
        "An adjustable swing restricting member 69 in the form of a nut and bolt arrangement is provided between and through the bracket 62 and the supporting member 65, passing through the vertical axle 63 arranged in the middle therebetween, and furthermore, a compression spring 70 fitted on the outer side of the bolt, is provided between the bracket 62 and the supporting member 65. One example of feeding means 60 is constituted by the elements 61 to 70, and the like.",
        "Consequently, the feeding means 60 causes the supporting member 65 and the link member 64 to swing towards the inner side about a vertical axis 71, due to the elastic repulsive force of the compression spring 70, and hence the feed roller 68 is urged in a direction which causes it to abut on the passive surfaces 15. The position of maximum approach is restricted by the swing restricting member 69.",
        "In FIG. 2, braking means 75 for applying a braking force to the movable body 10 by acting on the passive surfaces 15 is provided on the last end portion of the linear shaped path section 5a.

The rotational drive device 77 comprises a torque motor, or the like, and the feeding rotational force B is set so as to be smaller than the feeding rotational force A of the induction motor 56, in other words, such that A>B.",

        "As shown in FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 15, FIG. 19 and FIG. 20, pulling means 108 for pulling the movable body 10 towards the lateral travel rail members 80A, 80B is provided in the start end portion of the working path section 6.

        "A guide member 115 for guiding the operating pin 105 of the coupling member 100 is provided on the final end side of the direction of travel in the working path section 6, and hence by means of the operating pin 105 being guided by the guide pin 115, the coupling member 100 is caused to swing upwards against its own weight, thereby releasing the coupling thereof.",
        "Below, the operation of the first embodiment described above is described.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2, a movable body 10 which has moved along the linear shaped path section 5a due to the conveyance rotational force of the feeding means 78, or the like, is applied with a motional force (travel force) by the conveyance rotational force A of the feeding means 60 provided in the linear shaped path section 5a.",
        "More specifically, as shown by the dotted line C in FIG. 10, the feed roller 68 projecting on the inner side is caused to contact the passive surfaces 15 of the moving body 10 arriving there, by means of the elastic force of the compression spring 70, whereby, as shown by the solid lines in FIG. 10, it is pressed against the passive surfaces 15 in a retracted state, against the elastic force of the compression spring 70. In this case, the feed roller 68 is driven in rotation by the induction motor 66, and therefore, since the feed roller 68 which is subjected to forced rotation is in pressure contact with the passive surfaces 15, motional force is imparted to the movable body 10 due to the conveyance rotational force A thereof.",
        "Here, the abutting section 16 of the front end portion of the introduced movable body 10 abuts on the abutting section 17 of the rear end portion of the last movable body 10 of a movable body 10 group situated in a train-like formation on the linear shaped path section 5a, and thus the group of movable bodies 10 situated in a train-like formation on the linear shaped path section 5a is caused to move at a prescribed speed by the conveyance rotational force A of the feeding means 60, and the group of movable bodies 10 situated in a train-like formation on the linear shaped path section 5a is pushed from the rear and caused to move (see dotted lines in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4).",
        "The braking means 75 applies a braking force to the movable bodies 10 which have moved along the linear shaped path section 5a and have arrived at the final end side thereof. In other words, in the braking means 75, a braking roller 76 which is pressed against the passive surfaces 15 by an action similar to that of the feeding means 60 is caused to rotate forcibly, and a braking force is applied to the movable body 10 by the conveyance rotational force B thereof.",
        "Here, since the conveyance rotational force A of the feeding means 60 is greater than the conveyance rotational force B of the braking roller 76, the movable body 10 corresponding to the braking means 75 is caused to move whilst receiving a braking action, in accordance with the differential between the forces. Consequently, in the linear shaped path section 5a, a plurality of movable bodies 10 are caused to move in an aligned fashion between the feeding means 60 and the braking means 75, whilst being pressed tightly from the rear, without any gaps occurring between the front and rear ends thereof.",
        "The movement of the movable bodies 10 by the feeding means 60 as described above is performed by means of the feed roller 68 thereof acting successively on the passive surfaces 15 of the front frame member 12, and then from that to the passive surfaces 15 of the middle frame member 13, and on to the passive surfaces 15 of the rear frame member 14. Moreover, the feed roller 68 also acts on a passive surface on the side face of the connecting member 22 in the connecting device 20.",
        "In this case, when the feed roller 68 acts on the front frame member 12, the middle frame member 13 and the rear frame member 14 are pulled and moved by means of the connecting device 20. Moreover, when the feed roller 68 acts on the middle frame member 13, the front frame member 12 is pushed and moved via the connecting device 20, and the rear frame member 14 is pulled and moved via the connecting device 20. Furthermore, when the feed roller 68 acts on the rear frame member 14, the middle frame member 13 and front frame member 12 are pushed and moved via the connecting device 20.",
        "In this way, whilst a group of movable bodies 10 are moved in an intermittent or consecutive manner along the linear shaped path section 5a, or whilst they are intermittently halted, a floor-based operator, for example, can proceed with a variety of operations with respect to the conveyed items 115 supported by the supporting section 50, from below. Alternatively, a group of empty or full movable bodies 10 can be stored on the linear shaped path section 5a, whilst being moved in an intermittent or continuous fashion.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2, a movable body 10 moved so as to be projecting from the region of the braking means 75, is moved along the curved path section 5b by feeding means 79, whereupon it is conveyed along the linear shaped path section 5c. In this linear shaped path section 5c, the movable body 10 is moved by the feeding means 78 and enters into the prescribed region 5d.",
        "More specifically, in the prescribed region 5d, as illustrated in FIG. 1, the divided rail members 82A, 82B are connected to the main rail 2 at the upstream end thereof and are connected to the main rail 2 at the downstream end thereof. Thereby, the divided rail members 82A, 82B are disposed in an integral, linear fashion with respect to the main rail 2. Consequently, when there is no requirement to branch off a movable body 10 into the working path section 6, the movable body 10 is caused to move and pass through the prescribed region 5d, with the divided rail members 82A, 82B in the state.",
        "Furthermore, if a movable body 10 is to be branched off into the working path section 6, then firstly, as illustrated in FIG. 16, the lower side operating device 84A in the branching means 81 is operated, and the divided rail member 82A is caused to rotated about the vertical axis 83A, in such a manner that the downstream end thereof connects with the lateral travel rail member 80A. Thereby, after the leading end guided device 40 of the movable bodies 10 has passed from the upper side divided rail member 82B to the main rail 2, then as illustrated in FIG. 17, it will pass via the divided rail member 82A onto the lateral travel rail member 80A.",
        "In this case, the front side middle guided device 30 passes along the upper side divided rail member 82B, and by detecting the passage thereof, the upper side operating device 84B of the branching means 81 is operated, thereby causing the divided rail member 82B to turn about the vertical axis 83B and connecting the downstream end thereof to the lateral travel rail member 80B.",
        "Therefore, as illustrated in FIG. 18, after the front side middle guided device 30 has passed from the upper side divided rail member 82B to the main rail 2, similarly to the leading end guided device 40, it passes via the divided rail member 82A onto the lateral travel rail member 80A. In a similar manner to this, the rear side middle guided device 30 moves onto the lateral travel rail member 80B via the lower side divided rail member 82B. Thereupon, the rear side end guided device 40 moves onto the lateral travel rail member 80B via the lower side divided rail member 82B, similarly to the rear side middle guided device 30.",
        "In this way, as illustrated in FIG. 1, FIG. 13 and FIG. 19, the movable body 10 is branched off into the working path section 6 in a state wherein the front frame member 12 of the movable body 10 is aligned in a preceding fashion with one of the lateral travel rail members 80A, the middle frame member 13 which is fitted with the supporting section 50 adopts an orthogonal attitude with respect to the direction of travel, and furthermore, the rear frame member 14 is bent in the opposite direction so as to be aligned with the other lateral travel rail member 80B, in a trailing fashion. The divided rail members 82A, 82B are then rotated back in such a manner that the downstream ends thereof connect with the main rail 2.",
        "As illustrated by FIG. 15 and FIG. 19, when a movable body 10 has been branched off onto the working path section 6 in this way, the feed roller 68 of the pulling means 108 engages with the outer side of the upper passive surface 19 of the passive member 18 provided on the front frame member 12 or rear frame member 14, and with the supporting plate members 31a, 41a of the guided members 30, 40, thereby causing the movable body 10 to be pulled into the working path section 6 in the bended attitude, and then to be conveyed laterally. In this case, the pulling force of the feed roller 68 is transmitted reliably by means of the backup roller 109 in contact with the inner sides of the upper passive surface 19 of the passive member 18, and the supporting plate members 31a, 41a of the guided members 30, 40.",
        "The movable body 10 pulled in this way is then coupled with the movable body 10 which precedes it. More specifically, the movable body 10 positioned in front has a coupling member 100 provided on vertical axles 21, 25, facing in a rearward direction. The laterally conveyed movable body 10 has a coupling receiver member 90 provided on the vertical axles 21, 25, facing in a forward direction.",
        "In this state, when the laterally conveyed movable body 10 approaches the preceding movable body 10, firstly, the cam guide face 94 of the coupling receiver member 90 abuts on the cam guide face 104 of the opposing coupling member 100, whereby the coupling member 100 is caused to swing upwards about the horizontal pin 102, against its own weight, as illustrated by the dotted line in FIG. 6. By means of the cam guide face 94 passing over the cam guide face 104, the coupling member 100 then swings downwards about the horizontal pin 102, due to its own weight, whereby the front end portion thereof falls into the recess section 92, the coupling face 103 thereof abuts on the coupling receiver face 93, and the coupling member 100 is thus coupled to the coupling receiver member 90.",
        "In this case, in the group of movable bodies 10 branched off onto the working path section 6, the feed roller 68 of the motional force applying means 110 provided on the final end side of the working path section 6 abuts on the outer sides of the upper passive surfaces 19 of the passive member 18 of the movable body 10 opposing it, and the supporting plate members 31a, 41a of the guided devices 30, 40 thereof, thereby causing the movable bodies 10 to be conveyed laterally in a train-like fashion, whilst maintaining the bended attitude. In this case, the conveyance driving force of the feed roller 68 is transmitted reliably by means of a backup roller 111 in contact with the inner sides of the upper passive surface 19 and the supporting plate members 31a, 41a.",
        "By pulling and moving the group of movable bodies 10 in the working path section 6 in a train-like fashion by means of the motional force applying means 110 in this way, the motional force of the preceding movable body 10 is transmitted via the coupling member 100 thereof to the coupling receiver member 90 of the laterally conveyed movable body 10. By this means, the laterally conveyed movable body 10 receives a pulling force on the guided devices 30, 40 supported on the respective lateral travel rail members 80A, 80B, by means of the vertical axles 21, 25. In other words, the laterally conveyed movable body 10 is pulled and conveyed thereafter in a train-like fashion.",
        "When the leading movable body 10 reaches the final end portion of the working path section 6, the operating pin 105 provided on the coupling member 100 thereof is guided by the guide member 115, and coupling member 100 is caused to swing upwards against its own weight, thereby releasing the coupling thereof with the following movable body 10, as illustrated in FIG. 14. The leading movable body 10 is then joined into the fixed path 5A by the operation of the feed-in means 112. In this case, the joining operation is performed smoothly by means of the joining means 85 operating in a similar manner to the branching means 81.",
        "More specifically, by turning the two dividing rail members 86A, 86B about the vertical axes 87A, 87B, the upstream ends thereof are connected with the final end portions of the lateral travel rail members 80A, 80B, as shown in FIG. 20. By then applying a propelling force to the leading movable body 10 by the operation of feed-in means 112, firstly, the leading end guided device 40 of the movable body 10 is caused to flow from the lateral travel rail member 80A and onto the main rail 2A, by means of the divided rail member 86A. Thereupon, in a similar fashion, the front side middle guided device 30 flows from the lateral travel rail member 80A onto the main rail 2A by means of the divided rail member 86A, and in a simultaneous manner, the rear side middle guided device 30 flows onto the main rail 2A via the divided rail member 86B.",
        "Here, by detecting the passage of the front side middle guided device 30 over the divided rail member 86A, the lower side operating device 88A of the joining means 85 is operated, and the divided rail member 86A is turned about the vertical axis 87A, thereby connecting the upstream end thereof with the main rail 2A. In this state, the rear side middle guided device 30 joined onto the main rail 2A is moved along the divided rail member 86A, and the rear side end guided device 40 is joined onto the main rail 2A via the divided rail member 86B, similarly to the rear side middle guided device 30, and is then moved over the divided rail member 86A. In this way, the respective frame members 12, 13, 14 of the movable body 10 can be moved over the main rail 2A in a linear fashion.",
        "As described above, whilst a group of movable bodies 10 are moved in a train-like fashion in an intermittent or consecutive manner along the working path section 6, or whilst they are intermittently halted, a floor-based operator, for example, can proceed with a variety of operations with respect to the conveyed items 118 supported by the supporting section 50.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 19, in this case, since the front frame member 12 and rear frame member 14 are positioned in alignment with the downward direction of the two lateral travel rail members 80A, 80B, the spacing between the middle frame members 13 of preceding and following movable bodies 10 can be maintained at a distance corresponding to the length of the front frame member 12 or rear frame member 14. Thereby, the spacing between movable bodies 10 in the lateral travel direction can be maintained readily by a simple structure, and hence a group of movable bodies 10 can be moved laterally in the working path section 6 in such a manner that there is no mutual contact between conveyed items 118. Consequently, various types of work operations can be performed on the conveyed items 118, in a simple and accurate manner.",
        "When the movable body 10 moves in the manner, the middle guided device 30 is supported and guided via the respective supporting rollers 33 on the main rails 2, 2A, the divided rail members 82A, 82B, and the lateral travel rail members 80A, 80B, and the respective guided rollers 35 contact with and are guided by the main rail 2, 2A, the divided rail members 82A, 82B, and the lateral travel rail members 80A, 80B.",
        "Furthermore, the end guided device 40 is supported and guided via the respective supported rollers 43 on the main rails 2, 2A, the divided rail members 82A, 82B, and the lateral travel rail members 80A, 80B, and the respective guided rollers 46 contact with and are guided by the main rails 2, 2A, the divided rail members 82A, 82B, and the lateral travel rail members 80A, 80B, in addition to which the lift up prevention roller 47 opposes the main rails 2, 2A, the divided rail members 82A, 82B, and the lateral travel rail members 80A, 80B, from the under side thereof.",
        "In this way, the movement of the movable bodies 10 is performed in a stable fashion, without catching, toppling, lifting up, or the like, and hence various tasks can be performed with respect to the conveyed items 118 and the conveyed items 118 can be loaded and unloaded in an accurate manner at all times.",
        "In the train-like pushing movement along the fixed paths 5 described above, the main bodies 11 of the respective movable bodies 10, in other words, the respective frame members 12, 13, 14, assume a linear arrangement in plan view and side view, as illustrated in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, and therefore a state is achieved wherein the abutting sections 16 abut against the respective abutting sections 17 directly from the rear direction, and hence the pushing movement is achieved in a smooth and reliable manner.",
        "Furthermore, in the left (or right-hand) curved path section 5b, the respective frame members 12, 13, 14 are pushed from behind and moved in a bent attitude following the curve of the path, in plan view, in the regions of the connecting devices 20. Thereby, in plan view, the relative angle formed between the rear frame member 14 of the leading movable body 10 and the front frame member 12 of the following movable body 10 is an obtuse angle, and since the abutting section 16 meets the abutting section 17 at an obtuse angle, the pushing movement can be performed smoothly and reliably.",
        "Here, the curving is performed by relative rotation about the vertical axle 21 at the connecting device 20. Moreover, by means of the guided devices 30, 40 rotating about vertical axes 21a, 25a by means of the vertical axles 21, 25, the guided devices 30, 40 can be moved smoothly whilst the orientation thereof changes automatically in accordance with the leftward or rightward curvature of the main rail 2, 2A.",
        "Next, a second embodiment of the present invention is described on the basis of FIG. 21 to FIG. 24.
