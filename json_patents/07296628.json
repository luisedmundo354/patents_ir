        "In deepwater drilling rigs, marine risers extending from a wellhead fixed on the ocean floor have been used to circulate drilling fluid back to a structure or rig. The riser must be large enough in internal diameter to accommodate the largest bit and pipe that will be used in drilling a borehole. During the drilling process drilling fluid or mud fills the riser and wellbore.",
        "An example of a drilling rig and various drilling components is shown in FIG. 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,263,982 (which patent is incorporated herein by reference). A conventional slip or telescopic joint SJ, comprising an outer barrel OB and an inner barrel IB with a pressure seal therebetween can be used to compensate for the relative vertical movement or heave between the floating rig and the fixed subsea riser R. A Diverter D can been connected between the top inner barrel IB of the slip joint SJ and the floating structure or rig S to control gas accumulations in the riser R or low pressure formation gas from venting to the rig floor F. A ball joint BJ between the diverter D and the riser R can compensate for other relative movement (horizontal and rotational) or pitch and roll of the floating structure S and the riser R (which is fixed).",
        "The diverter D can use a diverter line DL to communicate drilling fluid or mud from the riser R to a choke manifold CM, shale shaker SS or other drilling fluid receiving device. Above the diverter D can be the flowline RF which can be configured to communicate with a mud pit MP. A conventional flexible choke line CL can be configured to communicate with a choke manifold CM. The drilling fluid can flow from the choke manifold CM to a mud-gas buster or separator MB and a flare line (not shown). The drilling fluid can then be discharged to a shale shaker SS, and mud pits MP. In addition to a choke line CL and kill line KL, a booster line BL can be used.",
        "After drilling operations, when preparing the wellbore and riser for production, it is desirable to remove the drilling fluid or mud. Removal of drilling fluid is typically done through displacement by a completion fluid. Because of its relatively high cost this drilling fluid is typically recovered for use in another drilling operation. Displacing the drilling fluid in multiple sections is desirable because the amount of drilling fluid to be removed during completion is typically greater than the storage space available at the drilling rig for either completion fluid and/or drilling fluid.",
        "In deep water settings, after drilling is stopped the total volume of drilling fluid in the well bore and the riser can be in excess of 5,000 barrels. However, many rigs do not have the capacity for storing 5,000 plus barrels of completion fluid and/or drilling fluid when displacing in one step the total volume of drilling fluid in the well bore and riser. Accordingly, displacement is typically done in two or more stages.",
        "Where the displacement process is performed in two or more stages, there is a risk that, during the time period between stages, the displacing fluid will intermix or interface with the drilling fluid thereby causing the drilling fluid to be unusable or require extensive and expensive reclamation efforts before being usable.",
        "It is believed that rotating the drill string during the displacement process helps to better remove the drilling fluid along with down hole contaminants such as mud, debris, and/or other items.",
        "It is believed that reciprocating the drill string during the displacement process also helps to loosen and/or remove unwanted downhole items by creating a plunging effect. Reciprocation can also allow scrapers and/or brushes to better clean desired portions of the walls of the well bore and casing, such as where perforations will be made for later production.",
        "During displacement there is a need to allow the drilling fluid to be displaced in two or more sections.",
        "During displacement there is a need to prevent intermixing of the drilling fluid with displacement fluid.",
        "During displacement there is a need to allow the drill string to rotate.",

        "In one embodiment a swivel having a sleeve and mandrel is used having at least one catch or upset to restrict longitudinal movement of the sleeve relative to the annular blow out preventer. In one embodiment a plurality of catches or upsets are used. In one embodiment the plurality of catches are longitudinally spaced apart.",
        "In one embodiment means are provided (such as grooves, rings, and other fluid pathways) to prevent the sleeve from forming a complete seal with the horizontal surfaces of the annular blowout preventer while the sleeve does seal with the vertical surfaces of the annular blowout preventer.",
        "One embodiment allows separation of the drilling fluid into upper and lower sections.",

Bushing 1300 allows for the overall outer diameter of sleeve 300 to be minimized relative to using roller or ball bearings between sleeve 300 and mandrel 110. Bushing 1300 also increases the maximum allowable thrust loading between mandrel 110 and sleeve 300 (relative to roller/ball bearings) while relative rotation between mandrel 110 and sleeve 300 occurs. Bushing 1300 can comprise outer surface 1310, inner surface 1320, upper surface 1330, and lower surface 1340. In FIG. 39 bushing 1300 is shown with a plurality of inserts 1382 on lower surface 1340 and inner surface 1320. Inserts 1382 can be limited to the surfaces of bushing 1300 which see movement during relative rotation and/or longitudinal movement between mandrel 110 and sleeve 300. FIGS. 40 and 41 are rough outs of bushing 1300, showing various recessed areas 1380 for inserts 1382. The finished bushing 1300 typically will have more recessed areas 1380 than shown in FIGS. 40 and 41. Bushing 1300 is shown having outer surface 1310 being adjacent to fourth inner diameter 1730 of sleeve 300. Such construction facilitates centering sleeve 300 relative to mandrel 110, increases life expectancy of packing units 1000, and restricts relative movement in the directions of arrows 1554,1556 (shown in FIG. 28). However, outer surface 1310 of bushing 1300 can be spaced apart from fourth inner diameter 1730 of sleeve 300.",
        "Bushing 1300 can be supported between end cap 1000 and hub 1400 (see FIG. 28). More specifically, bushing 1300 can be supported between base 1020 (of end cap 1000) and upper surface 1500 (of ring 1490). Relative rotation between end cap 1000 and bushing 1300 can be prevented by having a plurality of tips 1010 (of end cap 1000) operatively connected to a plurality of recesses 1390 (of bushing 1300). Base 1020 (of end cap 1000) supports upper surface 1330 (of bushing 1300). Lower surface 1340 of bushing 1300 is supported by upper surface 1500 (of ring 1490).",
        "Ring 1490 (FIGS. 37 and 38) can be operatively connected to hub 1400 (FIGS. 33 through 35) by a one or more dowels 1480 (see FIG. 28). Preferably, ring 1490 and hub 1400 would be a single piece of material, however, machining concerns may make two pieces more practical. Hub 1400 can be operably connected to mandrel 110 by one or more keys 1660 (see FIGS. 28,29,41, and 42). Keys 1660 can sit in recesses 1650 of mandrel 110. Fasteners 1670 can be used to affix a key 1660 to mandrel 110. Preferably, two keys 1660 are used to connect each hub 1400 to mandrel 110 (providing a total of four keys 1660). Each key 1660 can slide in a groove 1430 of hub 1400 allowing relative longitudinal movement between hub 1400 and mandrel 110.",
        "When mandrel 110 (of swivel 100\u2033) rotates hub 1400 (and ring 1490) rotates. When sleeve 300 rotates, end cap 1000 and bushing 1300 rotate. Based on this relative movement, lower surface 1340 (of bushing 1300) will move relative to upper surface 1500 (of ring 1490). Additionally, inner surface 1320 (of bushing 1300) will move relative to second surface 1610 (of mandrel). This is one reason for inserts 1382 being placed on bushing's 1300 inner surface 1320 and lower surface 1340. Also assisting in lubricating surfaces which move relative to one another, one or more radial openings 1350 can be radially spaced apart around each bushing 1300. Through openings 1350 a lubricant can be injected which can travel to inner surface 1320 along with lower surface 1340. The lubricant can be grease, oil, teflon, graphite, or other lubricant. The lubricant can be injected through a lubrication port (e.g., upper lubrication port 311). Perimeter pathway 1360 can assist in circumferentially distributing the injected lubricant around bushing 1300, and enable the lubricant to pass through the various openings 1350. Preferably no sharp surfaces/corners exist on outer surface 1310 of bushing 1300 which can damage o-ring 345 when (during assembly and disassembly of swivel 100\u2033) bushing 1300 passes by o-ring 345. Similarly preferable, no sharp surfaces/corners exist on first outer diameter 1070 of end cap 1000. Alternatively, outer surface 1310 can be constructed such that it does not touch o-ring 345 when being inserted into sleeve 300.",
        "In some situations a longitudinal thrust load can be placed on mandrel 110 and/or sleeve 300 causing mandrel 110 to move (relative to sleeve 300) in the direction of arrow 1552 and/or sleeve 300 to move (relative to mandrel 110) in the direction arrow 1550. In such a case, assuming that mandrel 110 remains longitudinally static, sleeve 300, end cap 1000, ring 1490, and bearing 1300 will move in the direction of arrow 1550 until lower surface 1420 (of hub 1400) is stopped by shoulder 1630 of mandrel 110 (see FIG. 28). During this motion hub 1400 will slide over one or more keys 1660 (through one or more grooves 1430). In such a manner a certain amount of longitudinal movement between sleeve 300 and mandrel 110 can be absorbed before a thrust load is generated by thrust hub 1400 contacting shoulder 1630. One example where absorption of longitudinal movement may be required where sleeve 300 is being held by annular seal unit 71 (see FIGS. 2 and 24), but where differential pressures existing between fluid above annular seal unit 71 and below annular seal unit 71 cause deflection of annular seal unit 71. In such a case, longitudinal deflection of annular seal unit 71 can be absorbed by relative motion between sleeve 300 and mandrel 110 before a thrust load is placed on thrust hub 1400 and bearing 1300 (see FIG. 28).",
        "FIGS. 44 and 45 show another alternative embodiment. FIG. 44 shows the lower portion of alternative swivel 100\u2032\u2033 (upper portion can be substantially similar, but a mirror image). FIG. 45 shows an end view of swivel 100\u2032\u2033. Swivel 100\u2032\u2033 incorporates mandrel 110\u2032 (FIG. 26) and sleeve 300\u2032. Rotation between mandrel 110\u2032 and sleeve 300\u2032 is facilitated by bearing 1300. Additionally, relative longitudinal movement between mandrel 110\u2032 and sleeve 300\u2032 (in the directions of arrows 1550,1552) is also facilitated by bearing 1300. End cap 1000\u2032 can be interconnected with bearing 1300 so that bearing 1300 will rotated with (and not relative to) sleeve 300\u2032. Sleeve 300\u2032 can be sealed with respect to mandrel 110\u2032 through a plurality of seals 1200. Plurality of seals 1200 can be substantially the same as those in other embodiments. Additionally, the opposing end of swivel 100\u2032\u2033 can be substantially similar to the end shown in FIG. 44. Swivel 100\u2032\u2033 can be a reciprocating swivel and have movements as shown in FIGS. 24 through 27.",
        "In deep water settings, after drilling is stopped the total volume of drilling fluid 22 in the well bore 40 and the riser 80 can be in excess of 5,000 barrels. This drilling fluid 22 must be removed to ready the well for completion. Because of its relatively high cost this drilling fluid 22 is typically recovered for use in another drilling operation. Removal of drilling fluid 22 is typically done through displacement by a completion fluid 96 or displacement fluid 94. However, many rigs 10 do not have the capacity to store and supply 5,000 plus barrels of completion fluid 10 (and/or drilling fluid 22) and thereby displace \u201cin one step\u201d the total volume of drilling fluid 22 in the well bore 40 and riser 80. Accordingly, displacement is done in two or more stages. However, where displacement process is performed in two or more stages, there is a high risk that, during the time period between the stages, the displacing fluid 94 and/or completion fluid 96 will intermix or interface with the drilling fluid 22 thereby causing the drilling fluid 22 to be unusable or require extensive and expensive reclamation efforts before being used again. Additionally, it has been found that, during displacement of the drilling fluid 22, rotation of the drill string 85,86 causes a rotation of the drilling fluid 22 in the riser 80 and well bore 40 and obtains a better overall recovery of the drilling fluid 22 and/or completion of the well. Additionally, during displacement there may be a need to move in a vertical direction (e.g., reciprocate) and/or rotate the drill string 85,86 while performing displacement operations. In one embodiment the riser 80 and well bore 40 can be separated into two volumetric sections 90,92 (e.g., 2,500 barrels each) where the rig 10 can carry a sufficient amount of displacement fluid 94 and/or completion fluid 96 to remove each section without stopping during the displacement process. In one embodiment, fluid removal of the two volumetric sections 90,92 in stages can be accomplished, but there is a break of an indefinite period of time between stages (although this break may be of short duration).",
        "In one embodiment a method and apparatus 100,100\u2032,100\u2033,100\u2032\u2033 is provided which can be detachably connected to an annular blowout preventer 70 thereby separating the drilling fluid 22 or mud into upper and lower sections 90,92 and allowing the fluid 22 to be removed in two stages while the drill string 85,86 is being rotated. In one embodiment the drill string 85,86 is not rotated, or rotated only intermittently. The swivel can be incorporated into a drill or well string 85,86 and enabling string sections both above and below the sleeve to be rotated in relation to the sleeve 300. Separating the drilling fluid 22 into upper and lower sections 90,92 prevents mixing displacement fluid 94, completion fluid 96 with the separated sections 90,92 during stages.",

        "In an alternative embodiment (schematically illustrated by FIG. 46) adds upper and lower catches 326,328 (or upsets) on sleeve 300.

This allows either catch to limit the extent of longitudinal movement of sleeve 300 without relying on frictional resistance between sleeve 300 and annular seal unit 71.

        "FIGS. 69 through 69 C are sectional views of swivel 3100 where sleeve 3300 is pulled up with respect to seal unit 71. In FIGS. 69A and 69C lower catch 3328 is in contact with seal unit 71 and upper catch 3326 is spaced apart from seal unit 71 by distance 3770. Plurality of arrows 3840 indicate fluid pressure above seal unit 71. Plurality of arrows 3850 indicate fluid pressure below seal unit 71. To reduce any a differential force on sleeve 3300 when contacting seal unit 71, lower catch 3328 can be prevented from sealing with respect to seal unit 71. One embodiment includes a groove and valley design for the bases of upper and lower catches 3326,3328, which design is shown in FIGS. 54-56,58, and 63-69. Such groove design is best shown in FIGS. 58 and 69A.",
        "Plurality of arrows 3850 in FIGS. 69A and 69C schematically illustrate fluid migrating between seal unit 71 and lower catch 3328. Fluid cannot migrate past seal unit 71 as it seals with sleeve 3300. FIG. 58 is a partial end view of the catches 3326,3328 showing a ridge and valley system. The upper half of the catch is not shown in FIG. 58. Shown are first and second ridges 3331,3333. Between these two ridges is first groove 3332. On the opposite side of second ridge 3333 as first groove 3332 is second groove 3334. A plurality of radial ports (e.g., 3336,3338, etc.) can be used to allow fluid to migrate to first and second grooves 3332,3334. Arrow 3342 schematically indicates a fluid migrating into a radial port. Arrows 3344,3346 schematically indicate the fluid continuing to migrate into first and second grooves 3332,3334. In this manner, where a seal is made between either catch 3326,3328 and seal unit 71, the amount of net increase in thrust load seen by sleeve 3300 is reduced by the areas of grooves 3332,3334.",
        "FIG. 70 is a schematic diagram illustrating swivel 3100 resting on well head 88. It is preferred that swivel 3100 be prevented from passing through wellhead 88. Here, this preference is accomplished by making the diameter of lower catch 3328 larger than the smallest opening in wellhead 88. Additionally, it is preferred that where swivel 3100 and wellhead 88 make contact any damage be reduced. Here, reduction of damage from contact is accomplished by making swivel conform to the shape of the smallest opening in wellhead 88. As shown the angle of first transitional area 3360 matches the angle 88\u2032 of the smallest opening in wellhead 88. In another embodiment, a contacting surface can be provided, such as hard rubber, polymer, etc.",
