Accurately assessing operating conditions facilitates accurate prediction of potential problems, troubleshooting existing problems, and predicting future power generation shortfalls.",
        "Gas and steam turbines used for power generation include a plurality of sensors which monitor key turbine parameters and associated components, for example, vibrational data, operating temperatures, operating speeds, operating pressures, valve and actuator settings, fuel demand, power generation, operational setting percentages, alarms, and operating states and conditions. The signals generated by the sensors are typically transmitted to a monitoring system within the plant at preset time intervals. At least some known monitoring systems are coupled to local intranets which enable users within the plant to view the data collected. However, the data collected cannot be viewed by remote user computers in real time.",
        "In one aspect, a method of viewing data of a turbine monitoring system from a remote location is provided. The turbine monitoring system includes a programmable logic controller having an interface rack. The method includes supplying an on-site monitoring computer, installing at least one communications gateway card in the interface rack, connecting the on-site monitoring computer to the at least one gateway card by a local area network, and connecting the on-site monitoring computer also to a wide area network.",
        "In another aspect, a method of viewing data of a turbine monitoring system from a remote location is provided. The turbine monitoring system includes a programmable logic controller having an interface rack. The method includes creating turbine operating data by the turbine monitoring system, transmitting the operating data to an on-site monitoring computer in real-time via a local area network that connects the on-site monitoring computer to the interface rack of the turbine monitoring system, transmitting the operating data to a remote computer by the onsite monitoring system in real-time via a wide area network that connects the on-site monitoring computer to the remote computer, and viewing the transmitted data at the remote computer.",
        "In another aspect, a system that facilitates viewing data of a turbine monitoring apparatus from a remote location is provided. The turbine monitoring apparatus includes a programmable logic controller having an interface rack. The system includes an on-site monitoring computer, a remote computer, at least one communications gateway card configured to communicate with the turbine monitoring apparatus, a local area network connecting the on-site monitoring computer to the at least one gateway card, and a wide area network connecting the on-site monitoring computer to the remote computer.",

The methods and systems facilitate, for example, a user at a remote location from a turbine to view real time data generated by a turbine monitoring system. Also, the remote user can view the configuration and settings of the monitoring system from the remote location. Further, if there are problems with the turbine or the monitoring system, the remote user can perform diagnostic evaluations from the remote location without the need of on-site personnel involvement, thereby reducing maintenance costs and times.",

On-site monitoring computer 18 is physically located at the same location as the turbine that is being monitored and is useful for facilitating the examination and analysis of data produced by turbine monitoring apparatus 12. Communication gateway cards 20 and 22 can be any suitable communications card, for example Ethernet/485 communication gateway cards. Also, Communication gateway cards 20 and 22 can be configured to interface with a T1 line an/or a T2 line.",
        "To enable workers/users 28 at a location 30 remote from the turbine location to view the data produced by monitoring apparatus 12, on-site monitoring computer 18 is operatively connected to a wide area network 32 through hub 26. Remote user computers 28 are networked together by a local area network 34 which is operatively connected to wide area network 32 by a router 36.
