    "description": [
        "The present invention relates to a process for preparing aqueous dispersions of fluoropolymers substantially free from fluorinated surfactants, in particular fluorinated ionic surfactants.",
        "More specifically the present invention relates to a process for preparing aqueous dispersions of fluoropolymers substantially free from perfluorooctanoate in the form of acid or its salts.",
        "With aqueous dispersions of fluoropolyemrs substantially free from fluorinated surfactants it is meant that the content of fluorinated surfactants referred to the fluoropolymer weight is lower than 100 ppm, in particular lower than 50 ppm, more specifically lower than 5 ppm.",
        "It is well known in the prior art that for the production of fluorinated polymers there are two different polymerization methods: the suspension polymerization and the emulsion polymerization.",
        "In the suspension polymerization polymer granules having millimetric sizes are obtained.",
        "In the emulsion polymerization a colloidal aqueous dispersion is obtained having particle sizes from some nanometers, generally 10 nm, to hundreds nanometers, from 100 nm to 400 nm. The emulsion polymerization process of fluoropolymers is carried out with a slow stirring and in the presence of surfactants not acting as chain transfer agent to avoid to obtain fluoropolymers having a low molecular weight and therefore having poor mechanical properties. Said surfactants are called non telogenic surfactants, see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,559,752. Perfluoroalkanoic acid salts, in particular, the ammonium salt and/or alkaline metal salts of the perfluorooctanoic acid, hereinafter indicated as PFOA, are industrially very often used. Other (per)fluorinated anionic surfactants are also used, see for example U.S. Pat. No. 3,271,341, U.S. Pat. No. 4,380,618, U.S. Pat. No. 4,864,006, U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,508.",
        "The PFOA is the most industrially used surfactant in the emulsion polymerization since it is not telogen, thus allowing to obtain fluorinated polymer dispersions having high molecular weight, and it allows to obtain stable dispersions for long periods of time.",
        "It is also known that in the applications of fluoropolymer dispersions, as coating or in the impregnation of glass fibers, said fluorinated surfactants can reach the environment, for example by the washing effluents, or because they disperse in the atmosphere during the drying and/or sintering steps. However some of said surfactants have been classified as harmful for the environment and are characterized by a low bioelimination rate from the human body. For example, the PFOA seems to belong to the surfactants particularly harmful for the environment and with long residence time in men. Therefore there is a request from the users of fluoropolymer dispersions substantially free from fluorinated anionic surfactants, and in particular free from PFOA.",
        "The fluoropolymer dispersions are obtained from the emulsion polymerization process with a fluorinated polymer concentration in the range 20-35% by weight referred to 100 parts by weight of the dispersion.",
        "The fluoropolymer dispersions obtained from the polymerization process can be subjected to post-treatments to obtain concentrated fluoropolymer dispersions, even up to 75% w/w. The concentration processes can be obtained, for example, by a decantation process as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,037,953, U.S. Pat. No. 3,704,272 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,301,807. In these patents no reference is made to the PFOA reduction in the obtained fluoropolymer dispersions.",
        "Another concentration process of fluoropolymer dispersions is the so called ultrafiltration process as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,136,893 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,369,266. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,369,266 it is described also a variant of the ultrafiltration process, allowing to obtain aqueous dispersions of fluoropolymers substantially free from fluorinated anionic surfactant, for example PFOA. The process is based on the fluoropolymer dispersions dialysis and the permeate is purified from PFOA by using anionic exchange resins. This process can be industrially carried out. The drawback of this process is due to the fact that the dialysis process is slow, in particular to obtain fluoropolymer dispersions having a very low PFOA content, lower than 10 ppm referred to the polymer weight.",
        "It is also known a process for obtaining polymeric dispersions substantially free from PFOA by direct contact of the stabilized dispersion with anionic exchange resins. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 3,536,643, EP 1,155,055, WO 03/051988. This process allows to obtain dispersions substantially free from PFOA with a good productivity, however it has the drawback that a part of fluoropolymer particles can remain in the anionic exchange resins when this process is industrially carried out. This drawback can happen if the stabilized fluoropolymer dispersion results locally unstabilized, for any reason, and therefore with coagulum formation. Or because a physical fluoropolymer trapping takes place. This involves a fluoropolymer loss, and above all it prevents the resin regeneration process with the drawback of the exhausted resins disposal.",
        "In patent application DE 100 18 853 it is described a process for obtaining dispersions substantially free from PFOA by distillation of the dispersion brought to pH between 1 and 3. Said process has the drawback to involve a strong dispersion destabilization and a high probability of coagulum formation. Besides, there is the drawback of the formation of a remarkable amount of foam creating problems in an industrial process.",
