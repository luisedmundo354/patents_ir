        "This invention described herein was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract, and is subject to the provisions of Public Law 96-517 (35 USC 202) in which the Contractor has elected to retain title.",
        "(1) Technical Field",
        "The present invention relates to a system and method of fabricating organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). More specifically, the present invention relates to the employment of a flexible, conductive particle-polymer composite material for ohmic contacts (i.e. drain and source).",
        "(2) Description of Related Art",
        "Organic electronics have recently attracted tremendous interest within the microelectronics industry for potential use in a wide range of commercial applications, such as large area flexible displays as well as other consumer electronics applications including smart cards, radio frequency identification (RFID) tags and electronic paper. This technology utilizes molecular and polymeric semiconducting compounds in place of traditional materials such as silicon. Thin-film transistors (TFTs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) can be fabricated from different organic and polymeric compounds using a variety of low-temperature, low-cost processing techniques including solution casting, spin coating and ink jet printing.",
        "Steady improvements in materials and processes over the last few years have brought the performance of organic-TFT (OTFT) devices in line with that of amorphous silicon devices. Unlike amorphous silicon, however, the organic semiconducting layers can be deposited at room temperature, allowing the organic semiconducting layers to be printed directly onto heat-sensitive structures. These TFTs can be used in applications where low-cost or mechanical flexibility is required.",
        "Beyond the aforementioned commercial applications, development of robust organic electronics for extreme environmental conditions is also of interest for space and military applications. Possible applications to human exploration of space include flexible displays, flexible health sensing electronics, and chemical/biological sensing electronics which could be incorporated into protective clothing. Potential applications for robotic missions include distributed sensors for large area surface diagnostics and metrology on inflatable/deployable structures. Examples of distributed sensors include temperature sensors, strain sensors, shape sensors, tear detection sensors or even sensors to control piezoelectric actuators. In the case of sensors distributed on large-area surfaces of inflatable/deployable structures, integration of rigid silicon-based chips within such a structure is impractical due to problems with assembly, die thinning, mechanical stresses, thermal mismatch and die attach. For these applications, very high-density electronics are not required (due to the very large areas available) and could benefit from the integration of flexible (OTFT) based sensor and sensor electronics.",
        "Previous work in the area of organic transistors has focused on the use of either 1) vacuum-deposited noble metal contacts or 2) solution-deposited intrinsically conducting molecular or polymeric contacts to the form the drain and source contacts.",
        "Use of vacuum-deposited noble metal contacts, such as gold or platinum, obviates one of the main benefits of organic electronics, i.e., low-cost processing based on solution or printing techniques. Vacuum deposition requires the use of techniques, such as sputtering or evaporation, instead of less expensive solution-based processes such as spin coating, casting or printing. Second, the use of gold or platinum for coating large area devices is potentially expensive, both from a stand point of materials and processing equipment. Again, this approach runs counter to the perceived low-cost benefit of organic electronics. Furthermore, the adhesion of gold to many organic materials is very poor.",
        "Some recent work has been carried out regarding intrinsically conducting molecular-based or polymeric-based contacts such as polyaniline and TTF-TCNQ, examples of such work include C. J. Druru, C. M. J. Mutsaers, C. M. Hart, et al., \u201cLow-cost All-polymer Integrated Circuits, Applied Physics Letters, vol. 73, pp. 108-110, July 1998 and K. Saito and S. Kobayashi, \u201cDeposition of Organic Electrodes Based on Wet Process for Organic Devices,\u201d Applied Physics Letters, vol. 80, pp. 1489-1491, February 2002. Unfortunately, these materials tend to exhibit high resistivities and poor overall performance, are prone to reaction with the surrounding environment, and are potentially unstable over time.",
        "Within the field of organic electronics, the search continues for molecular and polymeric semiconducting materials, which are soluble in common solvents, stable under ambient conditions and exhibit high carrier mobilities. In addition, within the field of organic electronics, studies are being conducted regarding materials that can be used as the gate dielectric and as the drain and source contact layers for organic-thin-film transistor (OTFT) devices. The drain and source contacts are particularly critical, as they form a direct ohmic contact with the organic semiconductor. Furthermore, it is desirable that these contacts be stable over time with respect to the semiconductor and dielectric interfaces as well as the ambient environment, particularly when biased at high voltages (up to a 100 V differential between drain/source and source/gate). Finally, for many emerging applications, it is desirable that these contacts be flexible, and may be able to be processed at low temperatures while maintaining adequate adhesion to the underlying substrate.",
        "To achieve an ohmic contact to the organic semiconductor, the work function of the contact should be well matched to that of the semiconductor. Previous work has focused on the use of noble metal contacts and conducting polymers to form these contacts. However, this type of processing can be expensive and can result in poor quality devices. What are needed are contacts which are inexpensive, flexible, stable, form ohmic contacts to common organic semiconductors, and can be readily processed without the need for expensive processing equipment, such as vacuum deposition equipment.",

        "(2) Details",
        "A bottom contact thin-film transistor geometry in accordance with the present invention is shown in FIG. 1. The bottom contact thin-film transistor comprises a gate contact 102, a supporting structure 104, a dielectric layer 106, an organic semiconductor layer 108, and drain/source contacts 110. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the polymer composite 110 may be deposited in an atmosphere, and not in a vacuum as is required for sputtering and vacuum deposition techniques. The following description and diagrams provide the reader with one method of producing a thin-film transistor geometry in accordance with the present invention. One skilled in the art will appreciate that there are other methods of manufacturing which could be used to arrive at the same result.",
        "FIG. 2A depicts the first part of the fabrication of the bottom contact thin-film transistor geometry in accordance with the present invention. In one embodiment, the supporting structure 104 is a highly boron-doped silicon wafer with a resistivity of 0.001-0.005 \u03a9-cm, which was procured from Virginia Semiconductor (Fredericksburg, Va.). The wafer acts not only as a supporting structure 104, but also provides the gate contact 102 to the dielectric by virtue of its low resistivity. This supporting structure could also be comprised of other rigid materials such as glass or a ceramic, or could be a flexible substrate such as a polyester or a polyimide-based material. When non-conducting support structures such as these are employed, a metallized gate contact would need to be added.",
        "FIG. 2B depicts the second part of the fabrication of the bottom contact thin-film transistor geometry. An oxide gate dielectric layer 106 is deposited or grown on the supporting structure 104. In one embodiment, the oxide gate dielectric layer 106 is 300 nm thick silicon dioxide (SiO2). Other possible choices for the dielectric layer 106 include, but are not limited to, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide, tantalum oxide, hafnium oxide, polyimide, and polyvinylphenol.",
        "FIG. 2C depicts the third part of the fabrication of the bottom contact thin-film transistor geometry in accordance with the present invention. A polymer composite 110 having a conducting filler is connected with the dielectric layer 106. For the example shown in FIG. 2C, the polymer composite 110 is placed on the dielectric layer. The polymer composite 110 is placed to form a contact pattern, i.e. a drain and source contact pattern. In one embodiment, the polymer composite 110 is a conductive carbon-based paste known as Flexible carbon conductor 2513 procured from Metech (Elverson, Pa.). This paste is comprised of a polyester-based polymer binder and solvent with conducting carbon particle filler, and forms a flexible conducting layer upon printing and subsequent curing (with a resistivity of less than 50 ohms per square, for a 25 micron thick layer (\u03a9/sq.-25 \u03bcm). The paste may be stencil-printed through 200 \u03bcm wide apertures, which vary in length between 10,000 \u03bcm and 100 \u03bcm (defining the channel width), with a separation between the pairs of drain-source contacts of between 500 \u03bcm and 100 \u03bcm (defining the channel length). One skilled in the art will appreciate that other conducting fillers such as graphite, silver, gold and other conducting derivatives of carbon may be used in place of the carbon material noted herein. A 125 \u03bcm thick laser cut stainless steel stencil, procured from Metal Etching Technology (Mt. Holly, N.J.), was used to form the drain and source contact patterns.",
        "In one embodiment, the polymer composite 110 was stencil-printed through the apertures using a metal squeegee, and then the polymer composite 110 was cured at 100\u00b0 C. on a hot plate for 30 minutes.",
        "Optionally, the polymer composite 110 and the underlying dielectric layer 106 is treated with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) using spin-coating at 2000 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 20 seconds.",
        "Referring back to FIG. 1, an organic semiconductor layer 108 is formed over the polymer composite 110 and the dielectric layer 106. In one embodiment, the organic semiconductor layer 108 is formed from by dissolving an organic semiconductor, i.e. 0.038 grams of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene), commercially known as P3HT from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.) in 10 milliliters of a solvent, i.e., toluene, forming a semiconductor solution. Toluene was chosen because the polymer composite 110 contacts did not appear to be dissolved or significantly swelled by this solvent. One skilled in the art will appreciate that any number of solvents can be used in place of toluene, such as xylenes, as well as other suitable aromatic and aliphatic solvents.",
        "The solution is optionally filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) syringe-filter and then deposited over at least a portion of the polymer composite 110. In one embodiment, the solution is drop-cast from the syringe onto the surface of the polymer composite 110 and the dielectric layer 106. The solvent is evaporated from the semiconductor solution, forming the P3HT layer. The layer was then dried under vacuum for 18 hours, to remove trace amounts of solvent. In one embodiment, the organic semiconductor layer 108 provides an electrical connection between a first portion and a second portion of the contact pattern formed by the polymer composite 110, i.e. the organic semiconductor layer 108 provides a channel between the drain and source contacts formed by the polymer composite 110.",
        "A device manufactured as described above, was then tested to determine its characteristics and properties. For testing purposes, a gate contact 102 was made to the cleaved wafer 104. In one embodiment, the contact was made by metallic tape. Contact was made to the drain and source polymer composite 110 contacts through probes connected to micromanipulators. Adhesion of the polymer composite 110 contacts with respect to probing was very good. Device measurements were conducted on an HP 4145B Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer from Agilent (Palo Alto, Calif.), with the drain-source voltage swept from 0 to \u2212100 Volts, and the gate bias varying from 0 to \u2212100 Volts (in \u221210 Volt steps).",
        "FIG. 3 depicts output characteristics from a device fabricated as discussed above. The x-axis is the drain-source voltage in Volts and the y-axis is the drain-source current in microamps (\u03bcA). Each curve on the graph represents the data taken at a different gate Voltage Vg. The output characteristics show a clear field-effect enhancement with increasing gate bias. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the polymer composite 110 contacts. The device tested had a channel length of 500 \u03bcm and a channel width of 5,000 \u03bcm. One skilled in the art will appreciate that smaller device geometries are possible, as printed feature sizes down to 37 \u03bcm have been demonstrated using micro-screen printing techniques, such as those disclosed in R. D. Shipton, C. J. Robertson, D. R. Gray et al., \u201cUltra-Fine Thick Film Printing with Foil Based \u03bc-Screens, Advancing Microelectronics, Vol. 29, July/August, 2002, incorporated herein by reference. Also, other techniques such as ink jet printing could be used to achieve finer line widths and spacings.",
        "As previously discussed, enhancement of the drain-source current, Ids is clearly seen as a function of increasing gate bias, Vg, in FIG. 3. An on/off current ratio, Ion/Ioff, of 45 was determined at Drain-Source Voltage, Vds, equal to \u2212100 Volts, with Vg=0 Volts (Ioff) and Vg=\u2212100 Volts (Ion).",
        "FIG. 4 depicts the square root of the drain current in \u03bcA1/2 vs. gate Voltage, Vg, at several drain-source voltages, Vds. A field-effect mobility of \u03bc\u22480.007 centimeters squared per volt-second (cm2/V-s) was estimated from the data (from the slope of the Vds=\u2212100 V curve over the range of Vg=0 V to \u221250 V using an oxide capacitance of Cox=1.2\u00d710\u22128 farads per centimeter squared (F/cm2) by extraction from eq. 1.",

For optimal performance, the semiconductor material, the solvent in which the semiconductor material is dissolved, the polymer composite, and the solvent in which the polymer composite is mixed should be chosen so that they do not cause the dissolution or breakdown of each other. For example, in the case of the bottom-contact geometry, the polymer composite is placed first, followed by the organic semiconductor; therefore, the solvent in which the organic semiconductor is dissolved should be chosen such that this solvent does not also dissolve the polymer composite. In the case of the top-contact geometry, the organic semiconductor is placed first, followed by the polymer composite; therefore, the solvent in which the polymer composite is mixed should be chosen such that it does not also dissolve the organic semiconductor."
