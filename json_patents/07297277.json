        "The present invention relates to a method of purifying used dry cleaning solvents containing laundry soils. The method employs membrane filtration to enhance the separation of the contaminants from the dry cleaning solvent with decreased energy consumption and solvent loss.",
        "Conventional laundering techniques for cleaning and refreshing (e.g., removing malodors) fabric articles can be generally categorized into the aqueous-based washing technique and the \u201cdry cleaning\u201d technique. The former involves immersion of the fabric article in a solution comprising primarily of water; detergent or soap may be added to enhance the cleaning function. The latter typically involves the use of non-aqueous fluids as the agent for cleaning and refreshing.",
        "Cleaning solvents, after being used in a laundering treatment, typically comprise contaminants, such as dyes, water and/or surfactants. Since the dry cleaning solvents are more expensive than water, there is a need to recycle/reuse the dry cleaning solvents in more than one treatment.",
        "Conventional dry cleaning solvents are subjected to a distillation method to remove some contaminants. Representative systems using the distillation method are disclosed in EP 543,665 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,942,007; 6,056,789; 6,059,845; and 6,086,635. However, equipment and conditions to run the distillation are extremely burdensome as well as energy consuming; thus, distillation method is not practical for consumer applications or home use. Among the drawbacks of the distillation method is the high cost of the distillation unit, the daily manual intervention required to clean the still bottom, and its ineffectiveness in removing volatile contaminants. Accordingly, there is a need to remove contaminants from dry cleaning solvents without distillation.",
        "There have been other methods to remove contaminants from dry cleaning solvents without distillation. Typically, these non-distillation methods use filtration only systems with adsorbent materials, such as activated carbons and/or clay. For example, the commonly used, commercially available KleenRite\u00ae filter is made of a clay absorbent and an activated carbon adsorbent. Representative filters containing carbon and clay adsorbent materials are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,277,336 and 3,658,459. However, such filter has a rather limited lifetime due to the high percentage of clay absorbent in the filter. The clay absorbent has a finite capacity for absorbing contaminants, such as water, and once that capacity is met, the filter must be replaced with a new filter. In addition to the limitations around the clay absorbent, the activated carbon adsorbent has limitations also. The particle size and/or pore size of the activated carbon adsorbent material allows some contaminants to flow past the activated carbon adsorbent material, thus making the filter ineffective. Further, in conventional use, the used, contaminated dry cleaning solvent is pumped through the filter at a rate that does not allow the clay absorbent and/or activated carbon adsorbent to remove contaminants effectively. This is especially true for those contaminants that are highly soluble in the dry cleaning solvent. Additionally, some of the solvents are lost due to the frequent changes of the filters.",
        "Therefore, it is desirable to have a method that effectively removes contaminants from a dry cleaning solvent such that the purified solvent can be recycled/reused.",
        "It is also desirable to have a method capable of purifying a dry cleaning solvent in an economical and energy efficient manner.",
        "It is further desirable to have a non-distillation method that effectively removes contaminants from the dry cleaning solvent at low temperature and ambient pressure.",
        "Additionally, it is desirable that the material used in the purification method is safe and durable.",

        "Membranes",
        "Nonporous membranes operate on the principle of molecular size selectivity. That is, the polymeric membrane material is selective such that small molecules, such as solvent molecules, would be allowed to permeate through the membrane, while any solute molecules larger than a certain molecular size would be rejected. This is referred to as the molecular cut-off value of a membrane. Several factors control the cut-off value of a membrane. For example, for a membrane made of polymers, the cut-off value is affected by factors such as the degree of crosslinking, the type of polymer, the degree of polymerization, the degree of crystallinity and density or packing of the polymer chains.",
        "In general, nonporous membranes have a cut-off value of 200 to 2000 Daltons, in weight-average molecular weight of the solutes. The cut-off value of a membrane is determined by analyzing the solutes that are rejected by the membrane, using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), wherein the GPC is operated according to test method ASTM D6474-99 using polystyrene calibration standards.",
        "The transport of solvent through nonporous membrane can be described as\n\nPermeability=Solubility\u00d7Diffusivity",
        "Solubility relates to the penetrant's ability to wet the membrane material and under equilibrium conditions, certain amount of the penetrant is retained in the membrane. Generally, a higher solubility between the solvent and the polymeric membrane material, would result in a higher the permeability of solvent through the membrane, thus, a higher flux of solvent passing through the membrane.",
        "The Hildebrand solubility parameter (\u03b4) can be used to estimate the compatibility or solubility between the lipophilic fluid and the membrane polymer. Generally, compatibility between two materials can be expected when their solubility parameters are close in value. The polymeric membrane materials suitable for use in the present invention would have a solubility parameter that differs from the solubility parameter of the lipophilic fluid by less than about 5 MPa1/2, preferably less than about 3 MPa1/2. It is known that D5 (decamethyl-cyclopentasiloxane) has a solubility parameter of about 19.7 MPa1/2, and water has a solubility parameter of about 23.4 MPa1/2; there is a large enough difference between these two liquids such that it is feasible to find a membrane that would reject water but allow D5 to permeate through the membrane. For example, a silicone based membrane may allow D5 to permeate through due to their similarities in solubility parameters.",
        "Diffusivity is inversely dependent on the molecular size of the penetrant. As the molecular size increases, the diffusivity decreases. In other words, the cut-off value of a nonporous membrane is a function of membrane diffusivity.",
        "The efficiency of the membrane is measured in Flux (F), which is the amount of material passing through the membrane per unit surface area and time:\n\nF=V\u00d7S\u22121\u00d7t\u22121\n\nwherein V is the volume, S is the membrane surface area, and t is time. The units of flux may be expressed in terms of cubic meters of solution per square meter surface area of membrane per day, or in terms of liters of solution per square meter surface area of membrane per hour.",
        "Flux is directly proportional to permeability, pressure differential, and inversely proportional to membrane thickness. It is found that the non-porous polymeric membrane is particularly effective when used in a pressure driven process. In a pressure driven process, the feed or charge side of the membrane is at pressure sufficient to drive permeate across the membrane and the discharge or permeate side of the membrane is at about atmospheric pressure. As the feed (e.g., a solution of one or more contaminants and a solvent) contacts the membrane, a portion of the feed solvent dissolves into the membrane and diffuses through; the contaminant below the cut-off value of the membrane also passes through to the discharge side; and the contaminant above the cut-off value of the membrane will be rejected by the membrane and be retained on the charge side. The filtered solution on the discharge side is referred to as the \u201cpermeate\u201d, which tends to be less concentrated in contaminants. In contrast, the incoming feed on the charge side is combined with the rejected contaminants to form the \u201cretentate\u201d, which becomes more and more concentrated in contaminants as the membrane filtration process goes on.",
        "Another parameter to measure the efficiency of the membrane is the rejection rate or percent rejection (% R), which is defined by following:\n\n% R=[1\u2212(C perm/C ret)]*100\n\nwherein Cperm is the concentration of the contaminant in the retentate and Cret is the concentration of the same contaminant in the permeate. Alternatively, the overall concentrations of all the contaminants in the retentate and in the permeate are used in calculating % rejection.",
        "It's desirable that membrane thickness, or in the case of a composite membrane, the thickness of the non-porous polymeric layer, is minimized to obtain higher flux. A membrane thickness of less than 1 \u03bcm, or less than about 0.5 \u03bcm is suitable for use in the present invention. Due to the solubility of membrane polymer in solvent, polymer typically tends to swell. Cross-linking of the polymeric membrane material would minimize the swelling and help maintaining the integrity of the membrane.",

        "Inorganic Porous Membranes",
        "Inorganic membranes generally possess superior chemical and thermal stability relative to polymeric materials. Inorganic membrane also possess mechanical integrity such that support layer is not needed. In fact, inorganic membrane can be used as the support layer in a membrane assembly for the polymeric membrane. Four different types of inorganic membranes may be distinguished: ceramic membranes; glass membranes; and metallic membranes (including carbon) and zeolitic membranes. Metallic membranes are obtained by via the sintering of metal powders such as stainless steel, tungsten, or molybdenum. Ceramics are formed by the combination of a metal such as aluminum, titanium, silicum or zirconium with a non-metal in the form of an oxide, nitride, or carbide. Ceramic membranes prepared from such materials from the main class of inorganic membranes, with aluminum oxide or alumina and zirconium oxide or zirconia. These membranes are usually prepared by sintering or by sol-gel processes. Glass membranes (silicon oxide or silica) are prepared by leaching on demixed glasses.",
        "The separation principle of inorganic membranes is similar to polymeric membrane. With the inorganic membranes, the solvent permeates thru well defined pores in an inorganic membrane. The pore size depends on membrane materials and method of membrane formation. The pore structure of inorganic membranes generally does not change when exposed to various solvents, while polymeric membranes may swell to a different extend depending on polymer solubility in a particular solvent. Suitable ceramic membrane can have pore size ranging from 10 to 100 Angstroms, or from 10 to about 50 Angstroms.",

The spiral wound configuration may be formed by wrapping the assembly around the conduit a plurality of times such that the assembly is in a readily handleable form. The unit is fitted within a shell (in manner comparable to a shell-and-tube heat exchanger) provided with an inlet at one end and an outlet at the other. A baffle-like seal between the inner surface of the shell and the outer surface of the spiral-wound unit prevents fluid from bypassing the operative membrane system and insures that fluid enters the system principally at one end.

The contaminants may be chemically modified or otherwise treated such that the modified contaminants become larger in size or less soluble in (e.g., becoming more hydrophilic) with the dry cleaning solvent such that the contaminants can be separated from the solvent more easily. The dry cleaning solvent thus purified can be used as working solvent in subsequent fabric article cleaning cycles. It is recognized that auxiliary methods using chemical modification or a purification agent can also be applied to purify or recycle dry cleaning composition, which may comprise an emulsion of a dry cleaning solvent and water, and various contaminants.",

        "The removal of contaminants in the purification process can be 100% removal of contaminants, but it does not have to be. Removal of about 50% to about 100% removal of contaminants present in the contaminated solvent or composition can be sufficient. The type of fabric articles and the type of contaminant are factors that influence the level of contaminants that may remain in the purified solvent or composition without impairing its cleaning performance. That is, the purified solvent or composition may comprise a higher level of one type of contaminant than another. For example, the level of dyes may be present from about 0.0001% to about 0.1%, preferably from about 0.00001% to about 0.1%, and more preferably from about 0% to about 0.01% by weight of the working solvent.

        "Several separation methods use membranes to effectuate the separation, including dialysis and diafiltration.",
        "Dialysis is the transfer of solute through a membrane as a result of a concentration gradient of the solute across the membrane. Osmosis operates under the same general principles as dialysis, except that the concentration gradient drives the solvent across the membrane. Dialysis is effective in the removal of low molecular weight solute molecules or ions from a solution via their passage through a semi-permeable membrane driven by a concentration gradient.",
        "Diafiltration is a variation of conventional dialysis in that the rate of micro-species removal is not dependent on concentration but is a function of the membrane flux, pressure, and membrane surface area relative to the volume to be exchanged or dialyzed. Repeated or continuous addition of fresh solvent flushes out or exchanges salts and other micro species efficiently and rapidly.",
        "The method comprises a first step of providing a mixture of a dry cleaning solvent and at least one contaminant. The mixture may be generated by exposing a fabric article to a dry cleaning solvent or a cleaning composition comprising dry cleaning solvent and other cleaning adjuncts, such as water or surfactants. Alternatively, water may be applied from a separate source to the fabric article in this cleaning step.

As the mixture gets modified by the purification agents of the present invention, the contaminants become less soluble in the modified mixture and the contaminants may begin to separate out of the bulk solvent, as indicated by cloudiness, precipitate forming, and the like. For example, adding an aggregation agent to the mixture may induce the contaminants to form aggregates, which have higher molecular weight and larger in size, and are more easily rejected by the membrane. Thus, significant improvement in membrane separation efficiency can be achieved.",

The former process is called a liquid-liquid extraction, wherein a foreign substance, such as an immiscible liquid, is introduced to provide a second phase, to which the compound(s) can preferentially migrate. The driving force is based on the partition coefficient of the solute compound(s) in the respective liquids. In this separation technique, the compounds in the two liquid phases are merely separated by an interface (i.e., a chemical barrier), not by a physical barrier.",

The cleaning system comprises a fabric article treating vessel, a dry cleaning solvent reservoir, and optionally, a sensor for monitoring the contaminant level in the dry cleaning solvent. When contaminants concentration exceeds some pre-determined value, the sensor would indicate that the dry cleaning solvent has reached maximum contaminant holding tolerance and needs to be purified. Additionally, solvent purification/recovery device comprising a membrane filtration unit capable of conducting the purification method of the present invention may also be provided as an integral part of the system/apparatus. However, it needs not be. The membrane filtration unit can be a stand-alone device, separate from the dry cleaning system.",

        "In one embodiment, a membrane filtration system is used in a fabric treating apparatus capable of cleaning fabric articles with lipophilic fluid (FIG. 1). Process step 10 contains contacting lipophilic fluid with fabric articles and cleaning agents that results. The contaminated lipophilic fluid resulting from cleaning of fabric articles in step 10 is collected in reservoir 20 by means of a pump or by gravity draining. Optionally, the reservoir can contain a fluid level sensor to prevent overfilling or underfilling. Collected lipophilic fluid is then treated in step 30 to remove insoluble contaminants that are at least about 100 um in size, preferably about 1 um in size, and more preferably about 0.1 um. Contaminated lipophilic fluid is then treated by a filtration membrane unit 40, preferably a compact spiral wound membrane unit. As contaminated lipophilic fluid is moved thru the membrane filtration unit 40, lipophilic fluid would permeate thru the membrane, preferably, membrane contains nonporous polymer separating layer, producing purified lipophilic fluid. Optionally, an aggregation agent, preferably, water is added to contaminated lipophilic fluid prior to exposure to the membrane filtration unit in process step 35. Also optionally, the aggregation agent may be dispersed or mixed into contaminated lipophilic fluid in order to provide uniform dispersion. An in-line or stationary mixer can be used. Addition of the aggregation agent would improve membrane separation efficiency, as contaminants would form aggregates or micelles produce larger difference between molecular weight of the lipophilic fluid and contaminants. Optionally, contaminated lipophilic fluid is cooled prior to the membrane filtration unit by at least about 5\u00b0 C., preferably by about 10\u00b0 C. in order to decrease solubility and promote aggregates formation. Cooling step can be performed with or without aggregation agent addition step.",
        "Optionally, the permeated purified lipophilic fluid is then passed thru an adsorbent material 50 in order to further purify the lipophilic fluid. The purified lipophilic fluid is then collected in a purified lipophilic fluid reservoir 60 and can be used for the next fabric treating cycle.",
        "The purification of contaminated lipophilic fluid may not necessarily be performed after each fabric treating cycle.",
        "The lipophilic fluid containing contaminants that did not permeate thru the membrane in the membrane unit 40 are recycled back to the reservoir 20. The concentration of contaminants in reservoir 20 would gradually increase and eventually reach a solubility limit where the contaminants would become insoluble and would be separated in the treatment step 30.",
        "Any suitable fabric article treating vessel known to those of ordinary skill in the art can be used. The fabric article treating vessel receives and retains a fabric article to be treated during the operation of the cleaning system. In other words, the fabric article treating vessel retains the fabric article while the fabric article is being contacted by the dry cleaning solvent. Nonlimiting examples of suitable fabric article treating vessels include commercial cleaning machines, domestic, in-home, washing machines, and clothes drying machines.",
        "The methods and systems of the present invention may be used in a service, such as a cleaning service, diaper service, uniform cleaning service, or commercial business, such as a laundromat, dry cleaner, linen service which is part of a hotel, restaurant, convention center, airport, cruise ship, port facility, casino, or may be used in the home.",

        "Additionally, the method of the present invention may also be performed in an apparatus capable of performing \u201cbi-modal\u201d cleaning functions. A \u201cbi-modal\u201d apparatus is one capable of performing both non-aqueous washing and aqueous washing in the same vessel, wherein the two washing modes can be performed in sequential washing cycles or in a combination washing cycle. Additionally, the bi-modal machine can also be capable of fully drying the clothes without having to transfer them to a separate machine. That is, a machine can have the bi-modal function as well as the dual-mode function.",
        "An apparatus suitable for use in the present invention will typically contain some type of control systems, including electrical systems, such as \u201csmart control systems\u201d, as well as more traditional electromechanical systems. The control systems would enable the user to select the size of the fabric load to be cleaned, the type of soiling, the extent of the soiling, the time for the cleaning cycle. Alternatively, the control systems provide for pre-set cleaning and/or refreshing cycles, or for controlling the length of the cycle, based on any number of ascertainable parameters the user programmed into the apparatus. For example, when the collection rate of dry cleaning solvent reaches a steady rate, the apparatus could turn its self off after a fixed period of time, or initiate another cycle for the dry cleaning solvent.",
        "In the case of electrical control systems, one option is to make the control device a so-called \u201csmart device\u201d, which provides smart functions, such as self diagnostics; load type and cycle selection; Internet links, which allow the user to start the apparatus remotely, inform the user when the apparatus has cleaned a fabric article, or allow the supplier to remotely diagnose problems if the apparatus malfunctioned. Furthermore, if the system of the present invention is only a part of a cleaning system, the so called \u201csmart system\u201d could be communicating with the other cleaning devices which would be used to complete the remainder of the cleaning, such as a washing machine, and a dryer.",

The first solvent system is allowed to migrate up to the top of the TLC plate to the horizontal line (17.5 cm) and typically takes about 30 minutes. The TLC plate is dried for 20 minutes. The second solvent system is allowed to migrate 16.5 cm up the plate and typically takes about 26 minutes. The TLC plate is dried for 30 minutes. The third solvent system is allowed to migrate 9.5 cm up the plate and typically takes about 9 minutes. The TLC plate is dried for 30 minutes. Spray the dried TLC plate evenly with 5-7 milliliters of 25% sulfuric acid and place on a hot plate heated to 250\u00b0-260\u00b0 C. and covered with a ceramic tape. Allow the plate to remain on the hot plate until fully charred (10-30 minutes). The charring time will vary according to the compounds tested. Remove the plate from the hot plate with heated spatulas (to prevent breakage) and place on a glass cloth pad to cool.
