    "abstract": "A composite transistor is disclosed for use in radiation hardening a CMOS IC formed on an SOI or bulk semiconductor substrate. The composite transistor has a circuit transistor and a blocking transistor connected in series with a common gate connection. A body terminal of the blocking transistor is connected only to a source terminal thereof, and to no other connection point. The blocking transistor acts to prevent a single-event transient (SET) occurring in the circuit transistor from being coupled outside the composite transistor. Similarly, when a SET occurs in the blocking transistor, the circuit transistor prevents the SET from being coupled outside the composite transistor. N-type and P-type composite transistors can be used for each and every transistor in the CMOS IC to radiation harden the IC, and can be used to form inverters and transmission gates which are the building blocks of CMOS ICs.",

        "This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. DE-AC04-94AL85000 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in the invention.",
        "The present invention relates in general to radiation hardening of integrated circuits (ICs), and more particularly to a radiation-hardened composite transistor which can be used to radiation harden complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits (ICs) to suppress single-event transients.",
        "Radiation hardening of ICs against single-event transients is becoming increasingly important as device sizes become smaller and smaller, and as clock speeds become faster and faster. A single-event transient (SET) is a disturbance in an IC produced by an energetic particle (e.g. an ion, proton, neutron) impinging on a sensitive node in the IC and depositing sufficient charge to create a transient signal therein. The sensitive nodes of a CMOS circuit are the drain-body reverse-biased junctions of the \u201cOFF\u201d transistors. When an energetic particle impinges on the drain-body reverse-biased junction in an \u201cOFF\u201d transistor, it generates electrons and holes which are collected by the junction. This can produce a transient signal which can temporarily switch the \u201cOFF\u201d transistor to an \u201cON\u201d state. As a result, the transient signal can change the state of a flip-flop, latch or memory cell formed by that transistor, thereby creating erroneous data in the IC and producing a single-event upset (SEU). The transient signal can also be propagated in the IC to affect the state of other logic elements therein.",
        "A number of schemes have been proposed and implemented to mitigate the effects of SETs and SEUs in digital circuits. These schemes are briefly discussed below.",
        "Spatial redundancy utilizes additional circuits to detect and/or correct SEU errors caused by SETs. This scheme, which includes the use of replicated storage cells and voting schemes, can require a significant increase in circuit complexity.",
        "Temporal redundancy is based on sampling an input multiple times before it is stored in a register. If the duration of a signal is less than a predetermined pulse width, the signal is assumed to be a SET or noise, and is ignored by the register. This scheme has been effective for hardening against SETs which are generated external to the register, but can be ineffective for a SET produced inside the register. Additionally, as CMOS devices become smaller and faster, they become more sensitive to SETs with the SETs having a pulse width comparable to the pulse width of the logic signals propagating in the IC. As a result, this scheme is expected to become less effective for smaller and faster transistors, or else the operating frequency of the ICs will need to be limited to allow effective filtering of the SET signal.",
        "Filtering is based on the use of feedback circuits which are added to registers to slow down their response time. As a result the registers do not respond to signals, external or internal, faster than a predetermined response time. This scheme imposes a space penalty due to the substrate space required for the feedback circuits; and it also imposes a speed penalty due to the response time set by the feedback circuits.",
        "SET reduction schemes are based on the use of processing techniques to reduce charge generation and collection in semiconductor material produced by energetic particle strikes. For example, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS transistors have a much smaller cross section compared with bulk CMOS transistors and thus are less sensitive to SETs. High-energy, high-dose implants can also be used for CMOS transistors to reduce the charge collection from an energetic particle strike. The use of SET reduction schemes can be difficult to implement for ICs fabricated in a foundry since it requires that the foundry's processing techniques must be changed.",
        "SET suppression schemes eliminate transient signal propagation when a SET occurs instead of mitigating the effects of the SET. SET suppression schemes have been disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,175,605; 6,278,287; 6,794,908; and in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0007743. The SET suppression schemes known heretofore are less than satisfactory due to a number of factors including the existence of alternate current paths that can allow propagation of SETs around a protected transistor, the existence of certain elements of a circuit (e.g. transmission gates) which remain unprotected against SETs, the inapplicability of these SET suppression schemes to circuits formed with bulk CMOS transistors, and the inapplicability of these SET suppression schemes to circuits formed with body-tied SOI transistors.",

The composite transistor 10 comprises a circuit transistor 12 and a blocking transistor 14 connected together as shown. Each circuit transistor 12 and blocking transistor 14 can be a metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistor. The term \u201cMOS transistor\u201d as used herein is intended to include transistors having gates formed of a metal, a metal alloy, or polycrystalline silicon (also termed polysilicon).",
        "In the example of FIG. 1, the circuit transistor 12 further comprises a source terminal 16, a drain terminal 18, a gate terminal 20 and a body terminal 22. The blocking transistor comprises another source terminal 24, another drain terminal 26, another gate terminal 28 and another body terminal 30. The gate terminals 20 and 28 are connected together as shown in FIG. 1 to form a gate terminal G for the composite transistor 10. The source terminal 16 forms a source terminal S for the composite transistor 10; and the drain terminal 26 forms a drain terminal D for the composite transistor 10. The body terminal 22 of the circuit transistor 12 also forms a body terminal B for the composite transistor 10. The body terminal 30 of the blocking transistor 14 is connected to the source terminal 24 thereof and is electrically isolated from any other connection point (also termed a node) in a CMOS IC wherein the transistor is used. According to the present invention, the body terminal 30 of the blocking transistor 14 is never connected to the body terminal 22 of the circuit transistor 12 through a direct or resistive interconnection, or to any other resistor, capacitor or transistor in the CMOS IC since this would provide a current path for a transient current to flow around the blocking transistor 14.",
        "Although FIG. 1 shows a p-type circuit transistor 12 and a p-type blocking transistor 14 to form a p-type composite transistor 10, a similar circuit arrangement can be used to form an n-type composite transistor 10\u2032 as shown in FIG. 2 using an n-type circuit transistor 12\u2032 and an n-type blocking transistor 14\u2032. In the p-type and n-type composite transistors, 10 and 10\u2032, of FIGS. 1 and 2, the body terminal B of the composite transistors can be tied to the source S thereof, or to a reference potential (e.g. Vdd or Vss). In other embodiments of the present invention, the body terminal B can be omitted from each transistor 10 and 10\u2032.",
        "The p-type and n-type composite transistors 10 and 10\u2032, respectively, are useful for radiation hardening CMOS ICs to mitigate against single-event transients (SETs). To radiation-harden any type of CMOS IC against SETs according to the present invention, each and every transistor in the IC will preferably be replaced by the composite transistors 10 and 10\u2032 of the present invention. When the CMOS IC to be radiation-hardened contains a transmission gate, a one-way or two-way transmission gate as described hereinafter can be substituted for the transmission gate in the CMOS IC. If this is done, then any SET that is produced within the circuit transistor or blocking transistor of one of the composite transistors 10 or 10\u2032 in the CMOS IC will be blocked from propagating to the output of that composite transistor 10 or 10\u2032 so that the CMOS IC will be unaffected by SETs.",
        "This can be understood by analyzing the performance of an inverter circuit 50 formed from a p-channel (i.e. p-type) composite transistor 10 and an n-channel (i.e. n-type) composite transistor 10\u2032 as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4A, 4B. FIG. 3 shows a schematic diagram of the inverter 50; and FIGS. 4A, 4B show schematic cross-section views of the circuit transistor 12\u2032 and the blocking transistor 14\u2032 to show the location of a drain-body junction 32 which is sensitive to an impinging energetic particle 100 when the transistors 12\u2032 and 14\u2032 are in an \u201cOFF\u201d state for which the drain-body junction 32 is reverse-biased. The drain-body junction 32 in each transistor 12\u2032 and 14\u2032 is located at the interface between an N+ doped drain and a P doped body of these transistors 12\u2032 and 14\u2032. In FIGS. 4A and 4B, the impinging energetic particle 100 is shown as an arrow which shows the path of the energetic particle 100.",
        "In FIG. 4A, the energetic particle 100 (e.g. an ion, proton or neutron) is shown impinging on the drain-body junction 32 of the n-type circuit transistor 12\u2032 when the input of the inverter 50 is \u201cLOW\u201d (i.e. approximately equal to VSS). With a \u201cLOW\u201d input, the n-type composite transistor 10\u2032 is turned \u201cOFF\u201d and the p-type composite transistor 10 is turned \u201cON\u201d to provide a \u201cHIGH\u201d state for the output of the inverter 50. In this state of the inverter 50, the energetic particle 100 impinging on the reverse-biased drain-body junction 32 of the n-type circuit transistor 12\u2032 will produce charges (i.e. electrons and holes) on either side of the junction 32 that result in a transient voltage source VSET being formed across the junction 32.",
        "In a conventional inverter having only a single n-type transistor and a single p-type transistor connected in series, the transient voltage VSET produced by an impinging energetic particle 100 could result in a relatively large transient current ISET that can temporarily pull down the \u201cHIGH\u201d output of the inverter to the \u201cLOW\u201d state, thereby producing a single-event transient (SET) which can be propagated to other circuits to which the inverter output is connected, thereby producing a single-event upset (SEU).",
        "In the present invention, however, the blocking transistor 14\u2032 in FIG. 4A will effectively suppress the transient current ISET since the blocking transistor 14\u2032 will be turned \u201cOFF\u201d by the \u201cLOW\u201d input of the inverter 50. In the \u201cOFF\u201d state, the blocking transistor 14\u2032 in FIG. 4A provides a very high source impedance (e.g. >100 M\u03a9) in series with the transient voltage VSET as compared with a very low Vdd source impedance of transistors 12 and 14 which are turned \u201cON\u201d by the \u201cLOW\u201d input of the inverter 50. The very high source impedance of the \u201cOFF\u201d blocking transistor 14\u2032 in FIG. 4A will reduce the transient current ISET to a very small value of approximately zero (i.e. ISET\u02dc0). As a result, the small value of the transient current ISET will be unable to pull down the \u201cHIGH\u201d output of the inverter 50 so that the inverter output will remain \u201cHIGH\u201d with a value approximately equal to Vdd as determined by the transistors 12 and 14 which are both turned \u201cON\u201d. Thus, although the SET occurs in the circuit transistor 12\u2032 in FIG. 4A, the SET will be prevented from reaching the output of the inverter 50 due to the blocking transistor 14\u2032. Eventually, the charges produced by the SET will recombine within the circuit transistor 12\u2032. The output of the inverter 50 and any other circuit connected thereto will thus be unaffected by the SET, thereby contributing to the radiation hardening of the inverter 50 against SETs.",
        "FIG. 4B schematically illustrates the situation when the energetic particle 100 impinges on the drain-body junction of the blocking transistor 14\u2032 which is in the \u201cOFF\u201d state when the input of the inverter 50 is \u201cLOW\u201d (i.e. \u02dcVss). In this case, the charge produced by the energetic particle 100 similarly produces a transient voltage source VSET across the reverse-biased drain-body junction 32 of the blocking transistor 14\u2032 in FIG. 4B. Since the circuit transistor 12\u2032 in FIG. 4B is also in the \u201cOFF\u201d state, the circuit transistor 12\u2032 will provide a very high source impedance (e.g. >100 M\u03a9) compared to the \u201cON\u201d transistors 12 and 14; and this will again reduce the transient current ISET to a very small value ISET\u02dc0. Again, since transient current ISET is nearly zero, it will be unable to affect the output of the inverter 50 which will remain \u201cHIGH\u201d. There is no alternative low-impedance path to Vss for the transient current ISET to flow since the body terminal 30 of the blocking transistor 14\u2032 is only connected to its source 24. Eventually, the electrons and holes produced by the energetic particle will recombine within the blocking transistor 14\u2032.",
        "In both cases above, there is no current path around the circuit transistor/blocking transistor pair that would allow the inverter output to be perturbed from its expected \u201cHIGH\u201d state. Note that in FIGS. 4A and 4B, the body (labelled \u201cP\u201d) of the blocking transistor 14\u2032 is tied only to the source (labelled \u201cN\u201d) of the blocking transistor 14\u2032 and not to any other node in the inverter 50 or to any voltage reference (e.g. Vss) or to any node in any other circuit that would provide a low-impedance current path so that a substantial transient current could reach the output of the inverter 50 to perturb its state.",
        "When the input to the inverter is \u201cHIGH\u201d (i.e. approximately equal to Vdd) and the p-type circuit and blocking transistors, 12 and 14, are turned \u201cOFF\u201d, then the effect of a SET on these transistors must be considered. In this case, which is similar to that depicted in FIGS. 4A and 4B, when either one of the circuit and blocking transistors, 12 and 14, experience a SET due to an incident energetic particle 100, the other transistor 14 or 12 in the p-type composite transistor 10 provides a very high source impedance in the \u201cOFF\u201d state which will limit the transient current ISET to being near zero. This very small value of the transient current ISET\u02dc0 will not alter the \u201cLOW\u201d output of the inverter 50 which is set by the n-type circuit and blocking transistors 12\u2032 and 14\u2032 being switched \u201cON\u201d. As a result, the effect of the SET will be mitigated; and the output of the inverter 50 will remain unchanged in the \u201cLOW\u201d state with a voltage of about Vss.",
        "The p-type and n-type composite transistors 10 and 10\u2032 of the present invention can be used to form any type of CMOS IC known to the art. This can be done simply by substituting a composite transistor 10 or 10\u2032 for each transistor of the same type in a conventional CMOS IC. This will be advantageous since then each and every transistor within the resulting CMOS IC will be protected against SETs. This is also advantageous over other known schemes which try to mitigate against SETs since these other schemes leave certain types of circuits such as transmission gates unprotected against SETs.",
        "That the present invention is also applicable to protect transmission gates against SETs can be seen from the examples of FIGS. 5A and 5B. FIG. 5A shows a body-tied one-way transmission gate 60 formed according to the present invention; and FIG. 5B shows a body-tied two-way transmission gate 70 formed according to the present invention.",
        "In FIG. 5A, the body-tied one-way transmission gate 60 is formed by connecting the source terminals S of a p-type composite transistor 10 and an n-type composite transistor 10\u2032 together to form an input for the transmission gate 60; and by connecting the drain terminals D of the composite transistors 10 and 10\u2032 together to form an output for the transmission gate 60. The body B of each composite transistor 10 and 10\u2032 is tied to the source S thereof so that the input signal will provide a well-defined reference voltage for each body B.",
        "The body-tied one-way transmission gate 60 in FIG. 5A is enabled to transmit a signal provided to the input in the direction indicated by the horizontal arrow when complementary control signals \u0100 and A are applied to the gates G of the composite transistors 10 and 10\u2032. The complementary control signals \u0100 and A allow each composite transistor 10 and 10\u2032 to be turned \u201cON\u201d or \u201cOFF\u201d together. When the transistors 10 and 10\u2032 are both \u201cOFF\u201d, the input signal is blocked. When the transistors 10 and 10\u2032 are both \u201cON\u201d, the input signal is transmitted to the output, with \u201cHIGH\u201d or positive values of the input signal being transmitted through the p-type composite transistor 10 to the output, and with \u201cLOW\u201d or negative values of the input signal being transmitted through the n-type composite transistor 10\u2032 to the output.",
        "To form a body-tied two-way transmission gate 70, two body-tied one-way transmission gates 60 can be connected together in opposite directions as shown in FIG. 5B. In FIG. 5B, an upper transmission gate 60 transmits a signal provided at an input/output terminal (labelled \u201cIn/Out\u201d) to an output/input terminal (labelled \u201cOut/In\u201d). The direction of transmission of this signal is indicated by the right-facing arrow in FIG. 5B. The other transmission gate 60 at the bottom of FIG. 5B acts to transmit a signal provided at the output/input terminal to the input/output terminal as indicated by the left-facing arrow. This arrangement allows the input in each direction to provide a well-defined voltage reference source for the body B of each composite transistor 10 and 10\u2032. The signals transmitted through the transmission gates 60 and 70 in FIGS. 5A and 5B can be either analog or digital signals.",
        "FIG. 5C shows another example of a two-way transmission gate 80 which can be formed on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate without any body ties. This example of the present invention can be formed similarly to that of FIG. 5A, with the body terminals of each transistor being left unconnected or omitted entirely. Since the body ties are not used, signals can flow through the transmission gate 80 in FIG. 5C in both directions, with the \u201cHIGH\u201d or positive values of the signals being conducted through the composite transistor 10, and with the \u201cLOW\u201d or negative values of the signals being conducted through the composite transistor 10\u2032.",

Such a CMOS IC 90 can be formed on a silicon-on-insulator substrate or on a bulk semiconductor substrate as will be described hereinafter.",
        "The transmission gates 60, 70 and 80 in the examples of FIGS. 5A, 5B and 5C are radiation-hardened against SETs in a manner similar to that previously described for the inverter circuit 50.

In either case, it is necessary to provide a body for each circuit transistor and each blocking transistor which is electrically isolated from the substrate. This ensures that there is no substrate current path for the transient current ISET between adjacent transistors or to the substrate that would allow the transient current ISET to perturb the output of a CMOS IC in which the composite transistors 10 and 10\u2032 are used. The isolated body for each circuit and blocking transistor also ensures that generated electrons and holes from a SET occurring in the SOI or bulk substrate will not be reach one or more of the transistors 12, 12\u2032, 14 and 14\u2032.",

Such a CMOS IC can contain up to hundred of thousands or more of individual logic elements and memory elements formed according to the teachings of the present invention using the n-type and p-type composite transistors 10 and 10\u2032.",
        "The SOI substrate 34 in FIGS. 6A and 6B comprises a buried oxide layer 36 sandwiched between a monocrystalline silicon body 38 and a monocrystalline silicon layer 40. Each circuit transistor 12 and 12\u2032 and each blocking transistor 14 and 14\u2032 can be fabricated in the monocrystalline silicon layer 40 using a series of well-known semiconductor IC processing steps which define a source 42, a drain 44, a gate 46 and a body 48 for each transistor. The body 48 for each transistor can be tied (i.e. electrically connected) to the source 42 thereof during fabrication of the transistors 12, 12\u2032, 14 and 14\u2032. This can be done, for example, by extending the body 48 of each transistor beneath the source 42 thereof and using an ion implantation step to form a heavily p- or n-doped region on a side of the source 42 opposite the body 48 as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,268,630 which is incorporated herein by reference. This p- or n-doped region electrically connects the source 42 to the body 48 thereby forming the transistors 12, 12\u2032, 14 and 14\u2032 as body-tied transistors.",

In yet other embodiments of the present invention, every transistor in the CMOS IC 90 formed on a SOI substrate 34 will be a composite transistor 10 or 10\u2032, with the transistors 12 and 14 or 12\u2032 and 14\u2032 being untied. Generally providing each transistor 12, 12\u2032, 14 and 14\u2032 as a body-tied transistor is to be desired since there can be undesirable effects due to threshold voltage level variations and other radiation susceptibilities when the bodies of these transistors are left untied.",

A field oxide 54 (e.g. comprising silicon dioxide or a silicate glass such as TEOS deposited from the decomposition of tetraethylortho silicate) can then be deposited to fill in the trench and surround each island 52, thereby separating and electrically isolating the body 48 of each transistor 12, 14, 12\u2032 and 14\u2032 from the body of an adjacent transistor in the CMOS IC 90. Since the body 48 of each transistor 12, 14, 12\u2032 and 14\u2032 is electrically isolated in its own island 52 by the surrounding field oxide 54 and also by the underlying buried oxide layer 36 there can be no substrate current path for a transient current ISET to reach any other transistor in the CMOS IC 90. The substrate isolation of the body 48 of each circuit transistor 12 or 12\u2032 from the blocking transistor 14 or 14\u2032 in each composite transistor 10 and 10\u2032 is essential in order to ensure that the composite transistors 10 and 10\u2032 are radiation-hardened against SETs.",
        "FIGS. 7A and 7B show schematic plan and cross-section views to illustrate another way of forming the CMOS IC 90 on a SOI substrate 34. In this case, the circuit transistor 12 or 12\u2032 and the blocking transistor 14 or 14\u2032 of each composite transistor 10 or 10\u2032 are formed in a common island 56 defined in the monocrystalline silicon layer 40. This is advantageous to save space on the SOI substrate 34, and also to provide a direct electrical connection between the source terminal of each blocking transistor 14 or 14\u2032 and the drain terminal of an adjacent circuit transistor 12 or 12\u2032. For each composite transistor 10 or 10\u2032, a common drain/source region 58 is used in FIGS. 7A and 7B to form the source for the blocking transistor 14 or 14\u2032 and the drain for the circuit transistor 12 or 12\u2032. Isolation of the body of the circuit transistor 12 or 12\u2032 from the blocking transistor 14 or 14\u2032 can be provided by extending the common drain/source region 58 completely across the common island 56 as shown in FIG. 7A.",
        "The composite transistors 10 and 10\u2032 of the present invention can also be used to fabricate the CMOS IC 90 on a bulk semiconductor substrate 62 which comprises silicon or germanium. This is schematically illustrated in the cross-section view of FIG. 8A for a p-type-doped bulk semiconductor substrate 62, and in FIG. 8B for an n-type-doped bulk semiconductor substrate 62. Each circuit transistor 12, 12\u2032 and each blocking transistor 14, 14\u2032 is preferably formed as a body-tied transistor (i.e. with the body terminal being connected to the source terminal of that transistor) when a bulk semiconductor substrate is used. The term \u201cbulk semiconductor substrate\u201d as used herein refers to a semiconductor wafer comprising a monocrystalline semiconductor material (e.g. monocrystalline silicon), and is intended to include an epitaxially-grown semiconductor layer of the same semiconductor type as the remainder of the wafer.",
        "When the bulk semiconductor substrate 62 is p-type-doped (e.g. by ion implanting or thermally diffusing a p-type dopant such as boron), the source 42 and drain 44 of each p-type circuit transistor 12 and each p-type blocking transistor 14 are formed in a separate n-type-doped well 64 (e.g. doped n-type with ion implanted or thermally diffused phosphorous) as shown in FIG. 8A. The n-type-doped wells 64 electrically isolate the p-type circuit and blocking transistors 12 and 14 from the p-type-doped substrate 62 by forming a reverse-biased semiconductor p-n junction at the interface of the n-type-doped well 64, which forms the body of each transistor 12 and 14, and the p-type-doped substrate 62. The n-type-doped wells 64 also serve to electrically isolate the bodies of the circuit and blocking transistors 12 and 14 from each other and from any other transistors, resistors, capacitors, etc., in the CMOS IC.",
        "In FIG. 8A, each n-type circuit transistor 12\u2032 and each n-type blocking transistor 14\u2032 is also formed in a separate p-type-doped well 66 (e.g. doped p-type with boron). However, since the p-type-doped wells 66 are of the same polarity as the p-type-doped substrate 62, the p-type-doped wells 66 are electrically connected to the p-type-doped substrate 62. To remedy this situation and provide electrical isolation to prevent any transient current ISET produced in the drain-body junction 32 of the n-type transistors 12\u2032 and 14\u2032 from being conducted through the substrate 62, the p-type-doped wells 66 are located inside another n-type-doped well 68 as shown in FIG. 8A. The n-type-doped well 68 can then be electrically connected to Vdd to provide a reverse-biased semiconductor p-n junction between the body of each transistor 12\u2032 and 14\u2032 and the n-type-doped well 68. Another reverse-biased semiconductor p-n junction is also formed between the n-type-doped well 68 and the p-type-doped substrate 62. These reverse-biased semiconductor p-n junctions block any electrical conduction between the bodies of the transistors 12\u2032 and 14\u2032 and also between the bodies 12\u2032 and 14\u2032 and the substrate 62. Additionally, the bodies of the n-type circuit and blocking transistors 12\u2032 and 14\u2032 are electrically isolated by the n-type-doped well 68 from any other transistors, resistors, capacitors etc., in the CMOS IC 90.",
        "FIG. 8B shows how the CMOS IC 90 can be fabricated on an n-type-doped semiconductor substrate 72. In this case, p-type-doped wells 66 are provided for each n-type circuit transistor 12\u2032 and n-type blocking transistor 14\u2032, with the bodies of these transistors being formed from the p-type-doped wells 66. The p-type-doped wells 66 can be formed, for example, by ion implanting boron into the n-type-doped substrate 72. The sources 42 and drains 44 of the transistors 12\u2032 and 14\u2032 can then be formed by ion implanting an n-type-dopant (e.g. phosphorous) into the wells 66.",
        "The p-type circuit and blocking transistors 12 and 14 are formed in n-type-doped wells 64 which are further located within another p-type-doped well 74 which can be electrically connected to Vss to form a reverse-biased semiconductor p-n junction between the body of each transistor 12 and 14, which is formed from one of the n-type-doped wells 64, and the p-type-doped well 74. Another reverse-biased semiconductor p-n junction is formed between the p-type-doped well 74 and the n-type-doped substrate 72. This electrically isolates the bodies of the p-type transistors 12 and 14 from each other and from the substrate 72 and eliminates any substrate conduction path for the transient current ISET. In FIG. 8B, the source 42 and drain 44 for each p-type transistor 12 and 14 comprises a region of p-type-doped semiconductor material which can be formed, for example, by ion implanting boron so that each source 42 and drain 44 is p-type doped to a concentration level higher than that of the substrate 72 and also higher than that of the wells 64 and 74.",
        "Although FIGS. 6-8 show each composite transistor 10 and 10\u2032 being formed with the circuit and blocking transistors located adjacent to each other, this is not necessary. In some embodiments of the present invention, the circuit and blocking transistors for each composite transistor 10 and 10\u2032 can be spatially separated by an intervening circuit or blocking transistor from another composite transistor 10 or 10\u2032. This can be advantageous to reduce the possibility for both the circuit transistor and the blocking transistor in a composite transistor 10 or 10\u2032 from being affected by the impact of an energetic particle at a shallow angle of incidence (i.e. an energetic particle which passes through both transistors and produces a transient voltage VSET and current ISET therein).",
        "FIG. 9A shows an example of a CMOS IC 90 fabricated on a bulk p-type-doped semiconductor substrate 62 where the p-type and n-type composite transistors 10 and 10\u2032 have been interlaced. In this arrangement, each n-type circuit and blocking transistor 12\u2032 and 14\u2032 is located in its own n-type-doped well 68 so that the p-type well 66, which forms the body of that transistor, is electrically isolated from the p-type-doped substrate 62. Fabrication of a CMOS IC 90 on a bulk n-type doped semiconductor substrate 72 can be performed similarly as shown in FIG. 9B with each p-type circuit and blocking transistor 12 and 14 being located in its own p-type-doped well 74 to provide electrical isolation for the n-type body 64 of that transistor 12 or 14. Each composite transistor 10 and 10\u2032 can be similarly interlaced on an SOI substrate when each circuit and blocking transistor 12, 12\u2032, 14 and 14\u2032 is formed in a separate island 52 as shown in the example of FIGS. 6A and 6B.",
