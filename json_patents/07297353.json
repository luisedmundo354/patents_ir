No. 10/156,407, filed May 29, 2002 now abandoned which is a Continuation-In-Part of International Application No. PCT/CN01/00067 with an international filing date of Jan. 20, 2001, and claims priority to Chinese Patent Application 00112680.6 filed Feb. 4, 2000, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.",
        "The present invention relates to the use of anemonin for treating aseptic inflammations, especially for treating various stubborn pains caused by aseptic inflammations.",
        "In the medical field, inflammations can be distinguished into two groups: bacterial inflammations and aseptic inflammations. Bacterial inflammations have widely been taken seriously because they are likely to lead to the attack of acute diseases. Plenty of anti-bacterial drugs such as antibiotics including penicillin and carbapenems have been developed as specific clinical medicaments aimed at bacterial inflammations. While, before this invention, there is no specific, even established effective medicament for aseptic inflammations. That is to say, it is quite a blank for medicaments for specifically treating aseptic inflammations in the international medical field. There isn't any pharmaceutical company which produce specific medicament for aseptic inflammations. Generally, aseptic inflammations include cervical spondylosis, lumbar diseases, periarthritis humeroscapularis, tennis elbow, muscular fascia syndrome, rheumatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, aseptic prostatitis, multiple neuritis, neurodermatitis, tenosynovitis, lumbar muscle strain, ischias, painful heel, migraine, chronic gastritis, early aseptic necrosis of femoral head, bronchial asthma, and other diseases belong to aseptic inflammations as defined in the medical field. Modern medical researches have demonstrated that hyperplastic spurs often stab peripheral soft tissue, then cause inflammatory exudation, edema, accumulation of metabolites and formation of adhesion, which stimulate nerve receptor and cause pain. Degeneration of intervertebral disc, hyperosteogeny, trauma, strain and a series of secondary pathologic variations lead to aseptic inflammations. Edema and adhesion, which is caused by aseptic inflammations around muscle, fascia, ligament, peripheral nerve plexus, joint capsule and vascular wall, compress spinal cord, vertebral artery and nerve root and lead to complex symptoms of cervical and lumbar vertebral which are difficult to be got rid of. Adhesion, calcificated ligament, fascia and myotasis are the main causes of many aseptic inflammatory diseases such as cervical and lumbar vertebral, periarthritis humeroscapulans, muscular fascia syndrome and osteoarthritis, etc. Hundreds millions of people all over the world are suffering from these diseases caused by aseptic inflammations though they are mostly chronic diseases.",
        "Aiming to the present status that there is no effective medicament for the variety of diseases and stubborn pain caused by aseptic inflammations, in the first aspect, the present invention provides a medicament for treating aseptic inflammations containing anemonin as its effective component. The compound of anemonin can be obtained by chemical synthesis, or especially be prepared from natural materials of Chinese herbs. It is evidenced by clinical tests that a medicament containing this active compound has notable curative effect on stubborn pain and body disorders/diseases, which are caused by aseptic inflammation and are common, frequently encountered and difficult to be cured. Such medicament can eliminate the aseptic inflammations, edema, adhesion caused by aseptic inflammations, and stubborn pain, complex body disorders caused by aseptic inflammation, edema and adhesion. Consequently, it can rapidly cure varieties of aseptic inflammatory diseases with high efficacy and safety. Furthermore, such medicament is non-toxic nor irritant. According to the second aspect of the present invention, the use of the compound of anemonin or the natural abstracts containing anemonin for treating aseptic inflammations is proposed.",
        "This invention also provides a pharmaceutical preparation for treating aseptic inflammations containing anemonin as effective component, especially in topical application forms. It provides the best way of administration for treating aseptic inflammations.",
        "This invention also provides a naturally originated medicament for treating aseptic inflammations containing as effective component the extract liquor of anemonin obtained from Chinese herbal medicine.",
        "Finally, the present invention provides a method for preparing a medicament according to the present invention, especially by extracting and preparing anemonin from natural medical plants. With the method according to the present invention, protoanemonin, which has strong toxicity and side effects, contained in rough material can be turned into non-irritant anemonin, which can then be produced in an industrial scale.",
        "FIG. 1 depicts the percutaneous permeation of anemonin as a plot of permeation amount versus time.",
        "The medicament according to the present invention for treating aseptic inflammations comprises a therapeutically effective amount of anemonin. The chemical structural formula of anemonin is as following:",
        "",
        "This compound can be prepared from the extracts from any natural Chinese herb containing ranunculin or protoanemonin. Suitable natural Chinese herbs include Ranunculaceous plants and Graminaceous plants, etc. Ranunculaceous plants include: Ranunculus japonicus Thunb., Caltha palustris L, Ranunculus sceleratus L., Anemone hupehensis Lem., Pulsatilla chinensis (Bge.) Regel, Anemone raddeana Regel, Anemone altaica Fisch, Ranunculus Chinensis Regel, anemonin-containing Clematis including Clematis chinensis osbeck, Clematis finetiana Levi. Et Vant., Clematis hexapetala Pall, Clematis Manshurica Rupr, Clematis paniculata, Clematis florida, Clematis lasiandra Maxim, Clematis uncinata champ.ex Benth and Clematis meyeniana Walp, as well as Anemone hupehensis Lem. var. japonic (Thunb.) Bowles et Stearn etc. Graminaceous plants include root of Imperata cylindrica, ranunculin-containing plants of Helleborus (Ranunculaceae), Anemone (Anemoneae), Hepatica (Anemoneae), Ranunculus (Ranunculeae), Bratrachium (Ranunculeae), and Aconitum scaposum var vaginatum (Delphineae).",
        "It is known from the publications prior to the present invention that each of the above natural herbs contains ranunculin or protoanemonin. It has been shown that they have certain anti-tumor activities in clinical tests. It has a long history and a wide use of fresh Ranunculus japonucus by topical application. It has good therapeutic effects on many common diseases such as periarthritis humeroscapularis, rheumatic arthritis and ischias. However, protoanemonin is strongly irritant and toxic. Inflammation will be caused if the skin contacts with these plants for a prolonged period, leading to redness, swelling, blistering etc. As a precursor of anemonin, ranunculin is enzymatically cleaved to remove saccharides and turn into protoanemonin. By polymerization, protoanemonin turns into dipolymer anemonin. Some natural herbs per se contain anemonin (mostly are produced during the storage of the herbs). It has been found that anemonin is inhibitory against staphylococcus, streptococcus, Bacillus diphtheriae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and E. coli, etc. Consequently, before this invention, these herbs containing protoanemonin or anemonin were used as antineoplastic, antiseptic and antiphlogistic drugs in clinic. In traditional Chinese medicine, such plants as Clematis chinensis are often used to treat rheumatism, promote circulation and relieve pain.",
        "After a long period of study, the present inventor found that whether with oral medication or topical use, the natural Chinese herbs including the above raw herbs containing protoanemonin are all irritant to human body. With oral medication, they result in severe gastro-enteritis and intoxication symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, even stimulate kidney and cause bloody urine and proteinuria. They cause redness, swelling and blister when contacted with skin. But this component has strong antibacterial activity. The above mentioned toxicity and side effects will disappear when water or an organic solvent is added to the raw herbs and the mixture is stored for a prolonged period (optionally with heating), or when ethyl ether, acetone or sulfuric acid is added so as to polymerize two moleculars of protoanemonin into anemonin. The latter compound has specific good effect on treating varieties of stubborn pains and body disorders induced by aseptic inflammations. Especially when a targeting trans-dermal formulation is used on the infected and painful sites, the effects will be very significant. It has been identified that the chemical structure of protoanemonin in raw herbs changes during extraction. That is to say, two molecules of protoanemonin polymerize into non-irritant anemonin. Based on these findings, the present invention proposes a medicament for treating aseptic inflammations containing anemonin as the main active component. Said anemonin can be a product of chemical synthesis, or a extracted product isolated from natural herbs, which is provided in the form of extract liquor of anemonin.",
        "According to the medical classification of inflammations, the aseptic inflammations described in this invention include follow diseases caused by aseptic inflammations: cervical spondylosis, lumbar diseases, periarthritis humeroscapularis, tennis elbow, muscular fascia syndrome, rheumatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, aseptic prostatitis, multiple neuritis, neurodermatitis, tenosynovitis, lumbar muscle strain; ischias, painful heel, migraine, stubborn stomach-ache, cancerous pain, bronchial asthma, and early necrosis of femoral head caused by aseptic inflammations, and other diseases belong to aseptic inflammations as defined in the medical field. It is worthy to note that stubborn chronic rheumatic arthritis, migraine, stubborn stomach-ache, and bronchial asthma can be cured rapidly with topical use of anemonin extract liquor for three times or even just once. This indicates that aseptic inflammation must be one of the causes of rheumatic arthritis, chronic gastritis, migraine and bronchial asthma.",
        "Prior to the present invention, the treatments for these diseases including conventional analgesics or physical therapeutics such as massage, manipulation and traction when the attack of these diseases occurs. Furthermore, the effects of these conventional treatments are temporary. Severe ones need to be treated with operation. Compared to the prior art, an anemonin extract liquor or medicament formulated with anemonin according to the present invention has greatly notable effects on varieties of aseptic inflammatory diseases. Topical application of the medicament may be enough for treating relevant diseases without requiring oral taking of medicine, injection, infusion, operation, acupuncture, massage, manipulation or hospitalization. For example, the relevant diseases can be cured by three times of wet-compressing with anemonin extract liquor. The therapeutic mechanism of the medicament according to the present invention may lay in that: with trans-dermal wet-compressing with anemonin solution on the affected sites, anemonin displays its notable effects of analgesia, anti-inflammation, repercussion, relieving spasm, decomposing adhesion and its strong trans-dermal absorption ability. It can remove in a short time the aseptic inflammations, which have been deposited many years in a muscle, muscle tendon, fascia, joint, synovial bursa, nerve plexus and among vascular walls. It can rapidly remove edema, decompose adhesion, and relieve tendons and calcified ligament. Massive blood enters muscles after the muscles being relaxed, then harmful metabolites such as exudative solution resulted from dilation of blood vessels can be cleared. Once the circulation is improved, the tensile force of a muscle increases. This then relieves even eliminates the pressure onto nerve roots, spinal cord and blood vessels caused by the stimulation and press of aseptic inflammations. Then cervical spondylosis, lumbar diseases, periarthritis humeroscapularis, tennis elbow, muscular fascia syndrome, ischias, painful heel, migraine, stubborn stomach-ache, rheumatic arthritis, lumbar muscle strain, osteoarthritis, aseptic prostatitis, pain due to old injury, tenosynovitis, multiple neuritis, cancerous pain and pain caused by other diseases can be cured. This mechanism is the same as that of treating cervical spondylosis, lumbar diseases, and muscular fascia syndrome with operation to relieve pressure and eliminate stimulation. Swelling pain and dysfunction of movement caused by adhesion and calcification of muscle, fascia and ligament were relieved and turned to normal due to the elimination of aseptic inflammations.",
        "The medicament according to the present invention contains anemonin as the active therapeutic component and optionally suitable pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or excipient. Whether a vehicle or excipient is used or not and its chose depend on the final dosage form of the medicament. According to conventional pharmaceutical methods, the medicament according to the present invention can be manufactured into preparations suitable for oral administration, injection and topical application. The preparations for topical use include liquid extract, plaster, suppository, liniment, paint, gelata, wet towel and other preparations suitable for the trans-dermal absorption of active components. Anemoninin used in the preparation of the medicament of the present invention may be synthetic, or can be extracted from the mentioned above raw herbs according to previously known methods, e.g., the method as described in Chemistry of Chinese Herbs Components (in Chinese), page 226, published by Science Publishing House (1977). According to this method, preparations for injection, oral or topical use can be prepared with purified anemonin crystal or anemonin extract liquor obtained from ranuculin-containing natural plants (the active component therein is anemonin). Experimental researches have proved that anemonin is of good stability. Anemonin functions as a treatment for varieties of aseptic inflammations without being affected by combination with many Chinese herbs and their chemical components. The stability of anemonin is also shown by the fact that the rapid and effective therapeutic effect of anemonin extract liquor on various aseptic inflammations won't be reduced under unfavorable conditions such as high temperature, low temperature, molding and decaying.",
        "In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the medicament for treating aseptic inflammations is naturally originated, which comprises, as the active component, an extract liquor obtained by extracting any natural plants or Chinese herbs containing anemonin or its precursors with an organic solvent, water, animal or vegetable oil, brewage vinegar or an inorganic acid.",
        "Therefore, besides the mentioned above methods for preparing the medicament of the present invention, this invention further provides a method for preparing anemonin extract liquor comprising a step of extracting a natural plant or Chinese herbal medicine containing anemonin or its precursor(s) in a sealed container with an organic solvent, water, animal or vegetable oil, brewage vinegar or an inorganic acid. After filtering, clarifying the extracting mixture, the anemonin extract liquor is obtained.",
        "In the method for preparing anemonin extract liquor according to the present invention, cold-maceration or hot-maceration may be made. The starting materials include Ranunculaceous plants such as Ranunculus japonicus Thunb., Caltha palustris L, Ranunculus sceleratus L., Anemone hupehensis Lem., Pulsatilla chinensis (Bge.) Regel, Anemone raddeana Regel, Anemone altaica Fisch, Ranunculus Chinensis Regel, anemonin-containing Clematis including Clematis chinensis osbeck, Clematis finetiana Levi. Et Vant., Clematis hexapetala Pall, Clematis Manshurica Rupr., Clematis paniculata, Clematis florida, Clematis lasiandra Maxim, Clematis uncinata champ.ex Benth and Clematis meyeniana Walp, as well as Anemone hupehensis Lem. var. japonic (Thunb.) Bowles et Stearn etc.; and Graminaceous plants such as root of Imperata cylindrica, ranunculin-containing plants of Helleborus (Ranunculaceae), Anemone (Anemoneae), Hepatica (Anemoneae), Ranunculus (Ranunculeae), Bratrachium (Ranunculeae), and Aconitum scaposum var. vaginatum (Delphineae). Herbal pieces for decoction such as pieces of Pulsatilla chinensis (Bge.) Regel, pieces of Clematis chinensis osbeck etc. Useful organic solvents include ethanol, methanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, chloroform, or mixture thereof. The cold-maceration used in this invention refers to soaking and extracting the raw material with extracting liquid at room temperature to obtain anemonin extract liquor. Hot-maceration refers to soaking and extracting the raw material in heat extracting liquid to get the extract liquor.",
        "The method of the present invention for preparing anemonin extract liquor is characterized in that it makes protoanemonin contained in raw material turn into anemonin by polymerization and result in anemonin extract liquor having anti-bacterial and anti-inflammation effects, especially anti-aseptic inflammations.",
        "From the practical point of view, a preferred embodiment of the method comprises soaking the raw material at room temperature with 30%-50% ethanol for over 8 months or adding the raw material to the same solvent kept boiling, sealing the container and soaking for over 6 months.",
        "According to the method of the present invention, effective parts of the raw herb can be chosen for extraction, such as the whole grass or a mixture of the whole grass and root of fresh Ranunculus japonicus Thunb. After being pulverized, the chosen effective part may be placed into an extraction jar, and an extractant is added in suitable proportion, then the jar is sealed to carry out the extraction. After being extracted, protoanemonin has been polymerized sufficiently and turned into anemonin, and the resultant anemonin has been dissolved in the solvent. After squeezing the contents discharged from the jar and removing the dregs, a juice is obtained. Then the juice may be filtered, and the filtrate is settled. An anemonin extract liquor, a clear yellow transparent liquid, is obtained (the content of anemonin in the extract can be determined with a conventional detection method.",
        "As mentioned above, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a method for converting protoanemonin contained in raw herbs into anemonin is provided, which comprises the step of storing the raw herb and a suitable extractant in suitable amounts under sealing conditions for a prolonged period. The suitable extractants useful in the present invention are the same as described above. Methanol may be hot or cold about 30% strength methanol. Vegetable oil may be castor oil, tea oil or peanut oil. Ethanol, methanol or water is preferably used as the extractant. One herb or any mixture of at least two herbs can be used as the raw herb. For example, the method according to the present invention can be carried out in the so-called hot-extraction manner as follows. The fresh Ranunculus japonicus Thunb. whole grass and its root or only the whole grass, after being pulverized, is placed into a container. Hot ethanol in suitable concentration, such as about 40% strength ethanol, used in an amount such that the weight ratio of the fresh Ranunculus japonicus Thunb. to ethanol is about 1:1, is then added into the container containing the fresh Ranunculus japonicus Thunb. The contents in the container are heated, and then the container is sealed and stored, to polymerize protoanemonin contained in the fresh Ranunculus japonicus Thunb. into anemonin and dissolve the resultant anemonin in the solvent. After squeezing the contents discharged from the container and removing the dregs, a juice is obtained. The juice is filtered, and the filtrate is settled. An anemonin extract liquor, a yellow transparent liquid, can be obtained.",
        "Alternatively, the method of the present invention can be carried out in the so-called cold-extraction manner as follows. The fresh Ranunculus japonicus Thunb. whole grass and its root or only the whole grass, after being pulverized, is placed into a container. About 40% strength ethanol or about 30% strength methanol, used in an amount such that the weight ratio of the fresh Ranunculus japonicus Thunb. to the ethanol is about 1:1, is then added into the container containing the fresh Ranunculus japonicus Thunb. Then the container is sealed and stored for a long period, to polymerize protoanemonin contained in the fresh Ranunculus japonicus Thunb. into anemonin and dissolve the resultant anemonin in the solvent. After squeezing the contents discharged from the container and removing the dregs, a juice is obtained. Then the juice is filtered, and the filtrate is settled. An anemonin extract liquor, a yellow transparent liquid, is obtained.",
        "Alternatively, the anemonin extract liquor can be obtained by the hot-extraction or cold-extraction method using herbal pieces for decoction as raw material, such as Clematis chinensis osbeck herbal pieces or Pulsatilla chinensis (Bge.) Regel herbal pieces. More particularly, the raw material is extracted with ethanol in suitable concentration, such as 40% strength ethanol, in such amount that the weight ratio of ethanol to the raw material is about 3:1, according to the hot-extraction or cold-extraction method. The container is sealed and stored for 3 to 6 months while the contents are stirred once a day, to dissolve the anemonin contained in Clematis chinensis osbeck or Pulsatilla chinensis (Bge.) Regel herbal pieces into ethanol completely. After filtration and settling, a brown anemonin extract liquor is obtained.",
        "If water is used as the solvent, the present method can be carried out in the so-called hot-extraction or cold extraction manner as follows. Water, used in amount such that the weight ratio of the fresh Ranunculus japonicus Thunb. to water is about 1:1, and suitable amount of preservative (foodstuff grade) are added directly into a container containing the pulverized fresh Ranunculus japonicus Thunb., and the container is sealed and stored, to polymerize protoanemonin contained in the fresh Ranunculus japonicus Thunb. into anemonin and dissolve the resultant anemonin in water. After squeezing the contents discharged from the container and removing the dregs, a juice is obtained. The juice is filtered, and the filtrate is settled.

        "The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition useful for treating aseptic inflammations comprising a therapeutically effective amount of anemonin and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle/excipient (if necessary). According to conventional pharmaceutical methods, the composition according to the present invention can be manufactured into preparations suitable for oral administration, injection and topical application. The preparations for topical use include liquid extract, plaster, suppository, liniment, paint and other preparations suitable for the trans-dermal absorption of active components. For example, said liquid extract can be the anemonin extract liquor obtained by extracting with 30-40% ethanol according to the method of the present invention. This liquid extract can be used to paint the affected sites or be applied to the affected sites with gauze soaked therewith. An anemonin ointment containing ethanol as preservative can be made as follows: 90% ethanol is added to fine powder of fresh Ranunculus japonicus at proportion of 1:3 (the fine powder/ethanol) in a container, the mixture is stirred thoroughly and sealed or heated and stored for a prolonged period. During the process, protoanemonin contained in the fresh Ranunculus japonicus will be polymerized into anemonin. Herbal pieces of Clematis chinensis osbeck or/and of Pulsatilla chinensis (Bge.) Regel can be extracted in the same way. The extract liquor may be decocted and concentrated into concentrated herbal granules (suitable additives can be added if necessary). The main active ingredient of such granules is anemonin and can be used for treating aseptic inflammations administered either orally or by topical use.",
        "Clinical use: Anemonin liquid or anemonin extract liquor can be made which contains 12.5 mg anemonin/25 ml of the liquid or solution. In one cycle of treatment for three weeks, 25 ml of the anemonin extract liquor is applied to the affected or painful sites of various aseptic inflammatory diseases with soaked gauze, once per week. The transdermal application may be carried out on an area of about 100 cm2 for about four hours. The curative ratio in one cycle of treatment is as high as 90%. This medicament relieves pain in short time. Notable therapeutic effect can be obtained after the first application. Some patients may be cured with only one application. There's no side effect such as redness, swelling, blistering, running liquid, allergic reaction or pain. This treatment has wide safe window and minimal toxicity. Anemonin liquid or anemonin extract liquor can be prepared into liquid extract, plaster, suppository, liniment, paint and other preparations for topical use.

        "1.0 Abstract",
        "Anemonin is the main effective ingredient of HUSANTIE, which, externally applied, can diminish inflammations and relieve pains. To investigate the action mechanism of inflammation diminishment of anemonin, we firstly examined the effects of HUSANTIE on functions of T-1's and B-1's, which are the main responsive cell to inflammations in the immuno-system of body. In the experiments of mitogen-induced responsive proliferation of T-1's and B-1's, anemonin exhibited remarkable immunosuppressed effect (anti-inflammation action) on responsive proliferation of T-1's and B-1's and obvious inhibition effect on livability of lymphocytes in vitro system by killing the lymphocytes directly.",
        "2.0. Aim",
        "In the inflammatory tissues, there are always inflammatory lymphocyte soakage, inflammatory factor secretion, injury or pain symptoms induced by bacterial inflammations or aseptic inflammations, and these symptoms are the basic forms of pathological response.",
        "The applicant investigated the anti-inflammation mechanism of anemonin, the main effective ingredient of HUSANTIE (a wet towel mentioned in example 8), from points of view of pathological and immunological researches. Using in vitro system, the effects of HUSANTIE on functions of normal lymphocytes by the mitogen-induced responsive proliferation of T-1's and B-1's method were examined firstly. If responsive proliferation was elevated by medicament, that is to say, the immunocompetence was enhanced, HUSANTIE would function in promotion of inflammatory response. If responsive proliferation was inhibited, that is to say, the immunocompetence was reduced, HUSANTIE would be supposed to bear anti-inflammation activity. A close relation of a result to its cause exists physiologically and pathologically between inflammation and pain as well as anti-inflammation action and alleviation of pain. This makes it possible that the medicament with immuno-suppression activity can be used to relieve pains induced by various inflammations in kinds of tissues such as arthritis, rheumatic arthritis etc. Examining the effect of anemonin on the function of lymphopoiesis of T-1's and B-1's will facilitate pharmacologic action mechanism of anti-inflammation and acesodyne to be realized.",

        "Anemonin has significant inflammation resistance and diminishment activities and exhibits particularly favorable curative effect on aseptic inflammation. However, anemonin is relatively stronger irritative and may induce nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, stimulate kidney, consequently cause side effects such as bloody urine and proteinuria. Based on its physical and chemical properties, anemonin is supposed to possess percutaneous penetration ability and could be used externally, whereby avoiding its stimulation to stomach and intestine, reducing toxicity to kidney and restraining bad effect. In the present research, the steady penetration rate of anemonin and ethanol effect on which were examined. This would throw light on exploiting percutaneous anemonin preparation.",

Twenty-four hours before the administration, the hairs on the back of the rabbits were removed with the area of 10\u00d715 cm. The injured skin groups were made by lacerating the skin after removing the hairs. The administration groups were given high concentration of Hu San Tie extract liquor (Guanyin Dew), while the control groups given 25% ethanol, then the animal was bound up and fixed. Twenty-four hours later, the residue on the administration area was removed with warm water. The responses of the administration area were observed after 1, 24, 36 and 72 hours respectively. The irritant reaction and its intensity according to Table E-1 and E-3 were scored. The numbers in Table E-1 was a average score of 3 rabbits in the corresponding group, the numbers with \u201ca\u201d indicated score of the intact skin administration group and the numbers with \u201cb\u201d indicated score of the injured skin control group.",
