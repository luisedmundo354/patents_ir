    "description": [
        "Recently, a variety of optical recording media have been developed and an optical pick-up device that may be shared by multiple types of optical recording media in order to record and reproduce signals have been manufactured. For example, it is known in the prior art to use a single optical pick-up device with either a DVD (Digital Versatile Disk) or a CD (Compact Disk including CD-ROM, CD-R, CD-RW) in order to record and reproduce signals. For these two optical recording media, the DVD uses visible light having a wavelength of approximately 657 nm for improved recording densities while the CD is required to use infrared light having a wavelength of approximately 790 nm because some recording media are insensitive to visible light. The optical pick-up device shared by these two recording media uses illumination light of two different peak wavelengths.",
        "The two optical recording media described above require different numerical apertures due to their different features. For example, the DVD is standardized to use a numerical aperture of 0.6 and the CD is standardized to use a numerical aperture in the range of 0.45-0.52. In prior art devices different numerical apertures are used depending on the optical recording media, and all aperture diaphragm, such as a liquid crystal shutter or a wavelength selective filter, may be used to achieve the different numerical apertures. Alternatively, multiple diaphragms may be interposed to achieve the different numerical apertures.",
        "However, the prior art techniques as described above increase the size of the device, as well as increase its complexity and cost.",
        "The inventors of the present application has previously disclosed in Japanese Patent Application 2002-156854 an objective lens that has a zonal part on one of lens surface at the outermost periphery thereof and that has a certain depth (or height) so as to apparently eliminate the light of one of tile wavelengths at the flux periphery and while maintaining the light of the outer wavelength. This objective lens eliminates the need for diaphragms, as provided in the prior art, and results in a downsized optical pickup device that can be produced at a reduced cost.",
        "The objective lens as described in Japanese Patent Application 2002-156854 has a circumferential stepped part at the boundary between the outermost peripheral area and an area inside thereof on one surface (with a depth, for example, equal to (2n+1)\u03bb/2) for one of the wavelengths \u03bb, with n being an integer) so as to form a zonal part on one of the surfaces of the objective lens at the outermost peripheral area and thereby substantially reduce the numerical aperture at the periphery for one of the wavelengths. However, this structure limits the position of the stepped part to a point corresponding to a difference in numerical apertures between two optical recording media (i.e., to at a certain distance from the optical axis). In other words, in order to apparently eliminate the intensity of light at the periphery due to interference effects, the stepped part should be provided nearly at the center of the region that contributes light to cause the destructive interference.",
        "The structure above does not give freedom of design with regard to the position at which the stepped part is formed. Therefore, it is difficult to design a lens having improved optical performance. Consequently, a beam profile corresponding to a required numerical aperture may in some cases not be obtainable. Prior art optical recording media objective lenses having three zonal parts are described for example in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications H09-145994, H09-145995, and H09-197108. However, the zonal parts are not for producing an interference effect and the two outer zonal parts converge light fluxes having different wavelengths from each other onto different predetermined points. Thus, the basic technical concepts differ from the present invention.",
        "The present invention relates to an optical recording media objective lens used with two different optical recording media that require different numerical apertures and working wavelengths, and enables efficient converging of the working lights on the corresponding optical recording media so as to record and/or reproduce information, and an optical pick-up device rising it. More precisely, the present invention relates to an optical recording media objective lens that uses interference effects so as to obtain the corresponding numerical apertures required for the two different optical recording media and an optical pick-up device using it.",

FIG. 1D is an enlarged cross-sectional view of the encircled part R shown in FIG. 1A, and shows a partial structure of the first surface 16 of the objective lens 8.

        "As described above, the CD-R and DVD use light beams having different numerical apertures for recording/reproducing. The former uses a numerical aperture of approximately 0.45 and the latter uses a numerical aperture of approximately 0.60. The zonal part 14 ensures a proper numerical aperture for each optical recording medium 9. The zonal part 14 is formed so that, among wavelengths of the laser beam 11 corresponding to the optical recording medium 9, the light at the periphery of a light flux having one of the wavelengths is apparently eliminated due to destructive interference while light at the periphery of the light flux having the other wavelength is maintained. Light waves of wavelength 790 nm (\u03bb1) passing inside and outside the zonal part 14 and through the zonal part 14 destructively interfere with each other, thereby apparently eliminating the light intensity at the periphery of the light flux. On the other hand, the zonal part 14 has the stepped parts 14a and 14b that do not cause destructive interference of light having the wavelength 657 nm (\u03bb2) between the light passing inside and outside the zonal part 14 and the light passing through the zonal parts 14, thereby maintaining the light intensity of wavelength 657 nm at the periphery of the light flux.",
        "A certain difference in optical path length between the light passing through the zonal part 14 and the light passing inside and outside the zonal part 14 leads to destructive interference for light of wavelength \u03bb1 that attenuates the light intensity in the periphery for this wavelength Thus, light having a wavelength \u03bb1 is subject to destructive interference due to there being a phase difference of an odd-number multiple of \u03bb1/2, and the light having a wavelength \u03bb2 is subject to a phase difference of an integral multiple of \u03bb2 wavelengths. However, because the light spot has a Gaussian distribution, it is preferred that there be a phase difference margin of \u03b41 and \u03b42, respectively, as noted above (i.e., with the values of \u03b41 and \u03b42 being 25% or, more desirably, 20% of the respective wavelength, as noted above). In other words, the stepped parts 14a and 14b should produce phase differences that satisfy the above Conditions (1) and (2).",
        "Assuming that the numerical aperture for the light having a wavelength of 790 nm (\u03bb1) is 0.45 and the numerical aperture for the light having a wavelength of 657 nm (\u03bb2) is 0.6, the zonal part 14 is formed of two concentric stepped parts 14a and 14b about the optical axis of the objective lens 8. The two stepped parts 14a and 14b have diameters on the lens surface that lie between the diameters that correspond to light fluxes having numerical apertures of 0.45 and 0.6 for the wavelengths 790 nm (\u03bb1) and 657 nm (\u03bb2), respectively.",
        "As for the light having a wavelength of 790 nm (\u03bb1), the light passing through the zonal part 14 and the light passing through the inner and outer parts 15a and 15b interfere with each other due to the phase difference being an odd-numbered multiple of \u03bb1/2, which eliminates the intensity of light at the periphery of a light flux so as to form a light flux having a numerical aperture of 0.45. On the other hand, as for light having a wavelength of 657 nm (\u03bb2), the light passing through the zonal part 14 and the light passing through the inner and outer parts 15a and 15b do not undergo destructive interference, and thus the original numerical aperture of 0.6 for the objective lens 8 is maintained for the wavelength \u03bb2.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1B, with the zonal part 14 provided on a surface of the objective lens 8, the laser beam 11 having a wavelength of 657 nm (\u03bb2) emitted from the semiconductor laser 4 is nearly collimated by the collimator lens 7 and enters the objective lens 8 when a DVD 9a is placed at a certain position (on a turntable) for recording/reproducing. Then, the incident laser beam 11 is converged by the objective lens 8 on the recording area 10a of the DVD 9a with a numerical aperture of 0.6.",
        "On the other hand, as shown in FIG. 1C, the laser beam 11 having a wavelength of 790 nm (\u03bb1) that is emitted from the semiconductor laser 3 enters the objective lens 8 when a CD-R 9b is placed at a certain position (on a turntable) for recording/reproducing. The incident laser beam 11 is then converged by the objective lens 8 onto the recording area 10b of the CD-R 9b with a numerical aperture of 0.45 because destructive interference caused by the zonal part 14 eliminates the light flux at the periphery.",
        "It is sufficient for this embodiment that the zonal part 14 is sized between the numerical apertures 0.45 and 0.6 for light having wavelengths of 790 nm (\u03bb1) and 657 nm (\u03bb2), respectively. Theoretically, it does not matter whether the zonal part 14 is positioned closer to the numerical aperture 0.45 or closer to the numerical aperture 0.6. However, it is desired in practice that the above Conditions (4) or (6) be satisfied, since more freedom is thereby given to the position of the zonal parts 14. This facilitates the designing of a lens having improved optical performance and yields significant practical efficacy.",
        "The zonal part 14 needs to cause destructive interference between the light passing inside and outside the zonal part 14 and the light passing through the zonal part 14 so as to substantially eliminate the light at the periphery of a light flux. Thus, it is desired that the zonal part 14 satisfy the above Condition (3) and, for improved optical performance, it is further desired that the zonal part satisfy the above Condition (4).",
        "Excellent results were obtained experimentally by satisfying the above Conditions (3) and (4) in designing the zonal parts 14. However, one may instead design the zonal part 14 so as to satisfy the above Condition (5). When designing the zonal part 14 using Condition (5), improved optical performance can be obtained by ensuring that the above Condition (6) is also satisfied.",
        "When an optical diffraction surface is provided on the objective lens 8, it is preferred that the optical diffractive surface and the zonal part 14 are formed on at least one and the same surface, and that the optical diffractive surface produces a phase difference of an integral multiple of 2\u03c0 radians at the stepped parts 14a and 14b so as to not disturb the wavefront at these stepped parts even though the a spherical surface is discontinuous, as described above.",
        "FIG. 40A schematically illustrates the phase difference on the optical diffractive surface at the stepped part being an integral multiple of 2\u03c0 radians. FIG. 40B schematically illustrates the phase difference on the optical diffractive surface at the stepped part not being an integral multiple of 2\u03c0 radians. In FIGS. 40A and 40B, the solid lines indicate the lens geometry, with the stepped parts having different depths in the direction Z\u2032 that is parallel to the optical axis. For convenience of illustration, the surface profile of the Fresnel surface is spherical.",
        "The optical recording medium 9 has a protective layer made of a PC (polycarbonate) for both CD-R and DVD recording media. A CD-R, including the protective layer, has a standardized geometric thickness of 1.2 mill. A DVD, including the protective layer, has a standardized geometric thickness of 0.6 mill. Due to a difference in thickness of the protective layer for these two optical recording media, the spherical aberrations that are generated differ in magnitude. To ensure the proper focusing, this requires different converging effects of the objective lens depending on the wavelength of light used. Hence, it is desired in the optical recording media objective lens of the present invention that an optical diffractive surface be provided on at least one of the lens surfaces so as to correct aberrations more efficiently in recording/reproducing on optical recording media. Needless to say, the optical recording media objective lens of the present invention can be formed without an optical diffractive surface. For example, this is possible where light from the light source is allowed to enter the objective lens in a slightly diverged state for one of the optical recording media, as in Embodiments 9 to 12 to be described in detail below. However, those embodiments in which an optical diffractive Surface is provided on the light source side of the optical recording media objective lens are the most preferred embodiments of the present invention, as in Embodiments 1 to 8 which will be described in detail below.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1A, an optical diffractive surface consisting of a concentric grating integrally formed with the lens material and having a serrated cross section is provided on the light-source side surface (hereinafter termed the first surface) of the objective lens 8 so as to ensure excellent recording/reproducing on either CD-R or DVD optical recording media 9. In FIG. 1A, as well as for the other figures that show a cross-sectional view, the serrated surface is shown in an exaggerated manner in order to clarify the optical diffractive surface.",
        "The optical diffractive surface exhibits a high diffraction effect for light having the first wavelength and converges this light flux at a first predetermined position in conjunction with the refractive power of the objective lens 8. On the other hand, the optical diffractive surface exhibits a low diffraction effect for light having the second wavelength and converges this light flux at a second predetermined position in conjunction with the refractive power of the objective lens. The low diffraction effect includes zero-order diffraction (i.e., 100% zero order diffracted light). In such a case, the light having the second wavelength converges at the second predetermined position due to the refractive power of the objective lens 8.",
        "Here, the first wavelength \u03bb1, corresponds to the wavelength of 790 nm for the CD-R and the second wavelength \u03bb2 corresponds to the wavelength of 657 nm for the DVD. An optical diffractive surface converges the first order diffracted light of these wavelengths at the corresponding recording areas in conjunction with the refractive power of the objective lens 8. The optical diffractive surface adds a difference in optical path length equal to \u03bb\u00b7\u03a6/(2\u03c0) to the diffracted light, where \u03bb is the wavelength and \u03a6 is the phase difference function of the optical diffractive surface. The phase difference function \u03a6 is given by the following equation:\n\n\u03a6=\u03a3Wi\u00b7Y2i\u2003\u2003Equation (B)\n\nwhere\n\n    \n    \n        Y is distance from the optical axis; and\n        Wi is a phase difference coefficient, with the summation extending over i.",
        "The grating pitch of the optical diffractive surface is determined by the phase difference function. The height of the serrated steps of the optical diffractive surface determines the percentage of light diffracted into each diffractive order. The largest diameter of the optical diffractive surface determines the numerical apertures and beam diameters of the incident laser beam 11 for the two wavelengths \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.",
        "The effect of the optical diffractive surface will now be described with reference to FIGS. 1B and 1C. FIGS. 1B and 1C relate to the objective lens 8 of Embodiments 1 to 8, which are described later. As shown in FIG. 1B, with the DVD 9a being placed at a predetermined position (i.e., on a turntable) as the optical recording medium 9 for recording/reproducing, a laser beam 11 having a wavelength of 657 nm (\u03bb2) that is emitted from the semiconductor laser 4 and is substantially collimated by the collimator lens 7 enters the objective lens 8 and is converged by it onto the recording area 10a of the DVD 9a.",
        "On the other hand, as shown in FIG. 1C, with the CD-R 9b being placed at a predetermined position (i.e., on the turntable) as the optical recording medium for recording/reproducing, a laser beam 11 having a wavelength of 790 nm (\u03bb1) that is emitted from the semiconductor laser 3 and is substantially collimated by the collimator lens 7 enters the objective lens 8. The incident laser beam 11 is converged by the objective lens 8 on the recording area 10b of the CD-R 9b.",
        "The objective lens 8 having the optical diffractive surface on the first surface and a spherical surfaces on both surfaces satisfactorily corrects aberrations for either optical recording media, the CD-R 9b or the DVD 9a that is used, thus ensuring proper focusing and excellent recording/reproducing.",
        "The laser beam 11 from the semiconductor laser 3 or 4 converges onto the recording area of the corresponding recording medium 9 a light spot having its aberrations corrected in either case due to the a spherical geometry formed on both Surfaces of the objective lens 8 and the effect of tile optical diffractive surface. The difference in magnitude of the spherical aberration is mainly due to tile difference in disk thickness for the two different types of optical recording media; however, the difference in wavelength of the incident light is also somewhat responsible. Both sources of aberrations are effectively corrected by the optical diffractive surface.",
        "The optical recording media objective lens 8 described above has a certain zonal part 14 for adjusting the aperture on the first surface. This allows the different optical recording media having different recording specifications, namely, CD-R versus DVD, to be illuminated by a light beam having a proper numerical aperture in a compact and inexpensive manner without making the structure of the optical pick-up device more complex, such as when using an aperture diaphragm that is formed, for example, of a liquid crystal shutter and a wavelength selective filter that is interposed, or by using multiple diaphragms that are mechanically switched into the light path. Instead, in the present invention, an optical diffractive surface that is formed on the first surface 16 is used to optimize the spherical aberration for wavelengths corresponding to the different optical recording media having different specifications and thus ensures proper convergence of the illumination light for excellent recording/reproduction.",

In other designs, both the optical diffractive surface and zonal part 14 can be formed on the surface on the optical recording media side, i.e., on the second surface. Alternatively, one of the optical diffractive surface and zonal part 14 can be formed on the light source side and the other on the optical recording media side. Theoretically, the same effect as obtained for this embodiment can be obtained with an appropriate geometrical design of the optical diffractive surface and zonal parts 14.",
        "The optical recording media objective lens 8 of the present invention will now be described in detail for several embodiments using Tables that define the construction and performance of the objective lens for each embodiment. In Embodiments 1-8, both surfaces of the objective lens are a spheric and an optical diffractive surface is also provided superimposed on the first surface 16. In Embodiments 9-12, both surfaces of the objective lens 8 are a spheric, but there is no superimposed optical diffractive surface. Each objective lens 8 is suitable for use with two different optical recording media having different specifications, such as CD-R versus DVD recording/reproducing. In the case of using either recording medium, a laser beam halving a proper wavelength for the recording medium used is accurately converged by the objective lens 8 onto the recording area of the corresponding optical recording medium.",

        "For comparison with the beam profiles in the embodiments described above, the numerical apertures and beam profiles for various wavelengths of a conventional optical recording media objective lens are shown in FIGS. 39A-39G.",
        "The zonal part can be positioned at any point within the range described above. In order to apparently eliminate the light amount of a light flux having the diameter between the two numerical apertures due to an interference effect, the zonal part can be positioned at a convenient point for optical design within the area effective for the elimination.",
        "With the structure above, more freedom of design is given to the zonal part position, facilitating the designing of a lens having improved optical performance. The optical recording media objective lens of the present invention and the optical pick-up device using it allow for the corresponding numerical apertures to two optical recording media having different specifications in a compact and inexpensive manner with excellent optical performance and with more freedom of design without making the structure of an optical pick-up device more complex.",
        "In the structure described above, a certain optical diffractive surface is formed on at least one of the lens surfaces, desirably on the light source side surface so that all light fluxes are collimated and excellently converged for multiple optical recording media for recording or reproducing.",
        "The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. For example, the optical recording media objective lens of the present invention is not restricted to the embodiments described above and various modifications can be made thereto. For example, the optical pick-up device of the present invention is not restricted to those that use a DVD or CD-R as the optical recording media for recording/reproducing. Instead, the present invention is applicable to an optical pick-up device shared by two different optical recording media having different working wavelength ranges and numerical apertures for recording/reproducing. In addition, the present invention may be applicable to two optical recording media that have different specifications, but the same disk thickness. The optical diffractive surface and zonal part of the objective lens 8 are configured based on the required specifications for each optical recording media.",
        "The objective lens 8 can be made of plastic materials, which reduce the weight and cost of the lens. The objective lens of the embodiments described above is a spherical on both surfaces in order to improve correction of aberrations. However, instead of using a spherical surfaces, a spherical lens can be used. Alternatively, only one of the surfaces may be a spherical.",
        "Also, the zonal part 14 of the objective lens 8 can protrude towards the light source. Although the optical pick-up device of the embodiments described above has two light sources that emit different wavelengths, and a selected light source is used depending on the optical recording medium used, one light source that selectively emits light of two different wavelengths, depending on the optical recording medium used, can be provided.",
        "In the embodiments described above, the objective lens 8 has the optical diffractive surface on the first surface 16. Therefore, the light from the light source is nearly collimated before it enters the objective lens 8 for both optical recording media. As described above, it is unnecessary to provide the optical diffractive surface on the objective lens 8 where the objective lens 8 is allowed to receive nearly collimated light for one of the optical recording media (for example, the DVD) and slightly diverged light from the light source for the other optical recording medium (for example the CD-R). Nevertheless, the optical diffractive surface can be formed in such a case. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention. Rather, the scope of the invention shall be defined as set forth in the following claims and their legal equivalents. All such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims."
