        "The present invention relates to a composition useful for the oxidation dyeing of keratin fibres, in particular of human keratin fibres and more particularly the hair, comprising, preferably in a medium that is suitable for dyeing, at least one oxidation dye, and also at least one polyoxyalkylenated carboxylic acid ether or a salt thereof, at least one mono- or polyglycerolated surfactant and at least one fatty alcohol (C8-C30) comprising at least one unsaturation.",
        "The invention also relates to the dyeing kits and devices, and processes using the composition.",
        "It is known practice to dye keratin fibres, and in particular human hair, with dye compositions containing oxidation dye precursors, generally known as \u201coxidation bases\u201d, in particular ortho- or para-phenylenediamines, ortho- or para-aminophenols, and heterocyclic bases.",
        "Oxidation dye precursors are compounds that are initially uncoloured or only weakly coloured, which develop their dyeing power on the hair in the presence of oxidizing agents, leading to the formation of coloured compounds. The formation of these coloured compounds results either from an oxidative condensation of the \u201coxidation bases\u201d with themselves or from an oxidative condensation of the \u201coxidation bases\u201d with coloration modifiers, or \u201ccouplers\u201d, which are generally present in the dye compositions used in oxidation dyeing and are represented more particularly by meta-phenylenediamines, meta-aminophenols and meta-diphenols, and certain heterocyclic compounds.",
        "The variety of molecules used, which consist on the one hand of the \u201coxidation bases\u201d and on the other hand of the \u201ccouplers\u201d, allows a very wide range of colours to be obtained.",
        "These oxidation bases and couplers are formulated in vehicles or supports allowing them to be applied to keratin fibres after mixing with an oxidizing agent.",
        "These vehicles are generally aqueous and usually comprise one or more surfactants.",
        "Thus, it has already been recommended to use anionic surfactants, in combination with nonionic surfactants such as mono- or polyglycerolated fatty alcohols and saturated fatty alcohols. The said combinations produce oxidation dye compositions that generate shades with very good dyeing properties. However, the search continues for supports that can further improve the properties of the colorations obtained.",
        "Thus, after considerable research conducted in this matter, the inventors have now discovered that it is possible to obtain oxidation dye compositions that produce even more powerful and more chromatic shades, by introducing into the dye composition at least one polyoxyalkylenated carboxylic acid ether or a salt thereof, at least one mono- or polyglycerolated nonionic surfactant and at least one fatty alcohol (C8-C30) comprising at least one unsaturation.",
        "One subject of the present invention is thus a composition for the oxidation dyeing of keratin fibres, in particular of human keratin fibres and more particularly the hair, comprising, preferably in a medium that is suitable for dyeing, at least one oxidation dye, and wherein it also comprises at least one polyoxyalkylenated carboxylic acid ether or a salt thereof, at least one mono- or polyglycerolated nonionic surfactant and at least one fatty alcohol (C8-C30) comprising at least one unsaturation.",
        "The dye composition also makes it possible to give a more transparent appearance to the formulations which comprise it and which are liquid.",
        "The shades obtained moreover have good fastness.",
        "Another subject of the invention relates to a ready-to-use composition for the oxidation dyeing of keratin fibres, which comprises, preferably in a medium that is suitable for dyeing, at least one composition as described above and at least one oxidizing agent.",
        "For the purposes of the present invention, the expression \u201cready-to-use composition\u201d means the composition intended to be applied immediately to the keratin fibres, i.e. it may be stored before use without further modification, or may result from the extemporaneous mixing of two or more compositions.",
        "The invention is also directed towards a process for the oxidation dyeing of keratin fibres, and in particular of human keratin fibres such as the hair, which comprises applying to the fibres a dye composition comprising, preferably in a medium that is suitable for dyeing, at least one oxidation dye, the colour being developed at alkaline, neutral or acidic pH using an oxidizing composition comprising, in a medium that is suitable for dyeing, at least one oxidizing agent, which is mixed with the dye composition just at the time of use, or which is applied sequentially without intermediate rinsing, the dye composition and the oxidizing composition also comprising, distributed indifferently (in any manner) between the two, at least one polyoxyalkylenated carboxylic acid ether or a salt thereof, at least one mono- or polyglycerolated nonionic surfactant and at least one fatty alcohol (C8-C30) comprising at least one unsaturation.",
        "In one variant of the process, the polyoxyalkylenated carboxylic acid ether(s) or salts thereof, mono- or polyglycerolated nonionic surfactant(s) and fatty alcohol(s) (C8-C30) comprising at least one unsaturation are combined in the same dye composition or oxidizing composition and even more particularly in the dye composition.",
        "A subject of the invention is also a multi-compartment dyeing device or \u201ckit\u201d for the oxidation dyeing of keratin fibres, in particular of human keratin fibres and more particularly the hair, which comprises a compartment containing a dye composition comprising, for example in a medium that is suitable for dyeing, at least one oxidation dye, and another compartment containing an oxidizing composition comprising, preferably in a medium that is suitable for dyeing, an oxidizing agent, the dye composition and the oxidizing composition also comprising, distributed indifferently between the two, at least one polyoxyalkylenated carboxylic acid ether or a salt thereof, at least one mono- or polyglycerolated nonionic surfactant and at least one fatty alcohol (C8-C30) comprising at least one unsaturation.",
        "In one device variant, the polyoxyalkylenated carboxylic acid ether(s) or salts thereof, mono- or polyglycerolated nonionic surfactant(s) and fatty alcohol(s) (C8-C30) comprising at least one unsaturation are combined in the same dye composition or oxidizing composition, and even more particularly in the dye composition.",
