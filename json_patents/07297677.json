        "The present invention provides a composition comprising pantothenic acid, nicotinamide, histidine, inositol and choline, its use in the treatment of a skin disorder and methods of controlling a skin disorder. The invention further provides a method of manufacturing a composition of the invention.",
        "In most household pets, a healthy skin and coat indicates an animal in general good health. As the skin and coat condition of a pet provides such an important visual impact (in particular to pet owners and/or to the public in general) it is, an ongoing aim in the art to improve the skin and hair conditions of animals, in particular where an animal suffers from a skin disorder.",
        "Canine skin disease is the single most common reason for a pet to be taken to a veterinary practice. It is suggested that the proportion of animals suffering from such diseases account for in the order of 15% of the workload of such practices. The main conditions which contribute to this statistic are flea allergic dermatitis, atopic (allergic) dermatitis, pyoderma (bacterial infection), seborrhea and mange (demodectic and sarcoptic). In the majority of these skin diseases, the barrier properties of the skin are substantially compromised.",
        "The primary role of the mammalian epidermis is to provide a barrier which protects the body from potentially damaging environmental influences, including a desiccating atmosphere, physical trauma and frequent contact with allergens, irritants and toxic agents. The outermost \u2018cornified\u2019 stratum corneum (SC) of the epidermis plays the principle role of barrier defence. The SC is formed by the terminal differentiation of the main skin cell-type known as the keratinocyte. The terminal differentiation process includes four essential steps: keratinisation, keratohyalin deposition, formation of an insoluble peripheral envelope and the generation of intercellular domains from the exocytosed lipid-rich lamellar bodies.",
        "The process of barrier formation is inextricably linked to control of cell differentiation. This is, in turn, dependent on the hydration state of the skin. Thus, any disturbance to the epidermis which results in an increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) will disturb hydration levels and in turn perturb many aspects of cell behaviour. A consequence of this can be poor skin structure leading to bacterial infection, penetration of allergens or toxic materials as well as increased water loss further exacerbating the condition.",
        "The present invention provides a composition which can be used to improve the natural barrier defences of the skin. The composition enhances the skin's natural resistance to disease as well as aiding recovery from disease.",
        "The first aspect of the present invention provides a composition comprising pantothenic acid, nicotinamide, histidine, inositol and choline, wherein pantothenic acid is provided at a level of 10 to 500 mg/400 kcal per day.",

        "Obtaining Canine Keratinocytes",
        "Canine keratinocytes were obtained via explant culture of skin samples taken from healthy adult animals (4 mm biopsy). Samples are washed and dissected in cold PBS containing antibiotics. The epidermis is dissected away from the dermis and cut into 1 mm2 pieces. The pieces of epidermis are then placed into individual wells of a 24 well collagen-coated plastic plate and briefly allowed to dry down (60 seconds). Green's medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum is then added and the explants cultured for 7-10 days until keratinocytes begin growing out of the edges of the skin. The primary skin cells are now detached from the plastic and explant tissue using trypsin and moved onto a i3T3 (irradiated fibroblast) feeder layer. Cells are expanded on the feeder layer until near confluent at which time they can be moved onto plastic alone. The primary keratinocytes can be used for assays at this point or further expanded in number as required.",
        "In Vitro Lipid Synthesis Assays",
        "Keratinocytes are seeded in collagen-coated 24 well plates at a density of 5\u00d7104 cells per well. These cells are allowed to settle overnight and then the media changed. Cells are then left for 4 days under proliferation promoting culture conditions (in the presence of bovine pituitary extract). Following the 4 days the media is changed to one that promotes differentiation and at this stage the supplement to be tested is added (see individual experiments). Following 6 days under these conditions [14C]-Serine is added for the ceramide assay or [14C]-Acetate added for the total lipid assay, in both cases at 0.5 microCi per well. Cells are incubated in the presence of the radioactive markers and supplement for 2 days. At the end of the incubation period cells were harvested using trypsin and washed using PBS. Lipids were subsequently extracted using Bligh-Dyer solution and then added to 4 ml of scintillation fluid. The radioactivity was counted with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Results for the ceramide synthesis assays are seen in FIGS. 1-6. Results for total lipid synthesis assays are seen in FIGS. 7-8.",
        "In order to study the potential for nutritional supplementation to improve canine epidermal barrier function laboratory based screening assays were developed. These assays were designed in two different formats. The first set of assays focus on the influence of supplementation on the ability of skin cells (keratinocytes) to synthesise epidermal lipids and/or proliferate. The successful manufacture of skin lipids is intrinsic to the formation of an effective epidermal barrier. Adequate proliferation of keratinocytes is essential to provide new cells which replace those constantly lost due to sloughing off at the surface.",
        "Barrier Function Diffusion Assay",
        "Costar Snapwell plates (ASL Cat no. 402/0369/08) are set up containing 2.6 ml Greens Media in the outer well and 400 microliters Greens media in the inner well. The latter is seeded with 1\u00d7105 canine keratinocytes. These plates are incubated at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO2. The Greens media in the inner well is changed after 24 hours to remove dead cells and the plates then cultured for a further 48 hours. Greens media is prepared containing test concentrations of supplements (see Table 1). On day three the media is removed from the inner and outer wells and 900 microliters of test/control media put into the outer well. The quantity of media added ensures that the keratinocytes are at the air-liquid interface. The plates are cultured for a further seven days with the media being replaced every two/three days. Two Snapwells were used per concentration of supplement and two per control.",
        "On day ten the Snapwells were ready for the diffusion assay. At this point the inner well of each Snapwell is removed and placed into individual diffusion chambers. Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) is added to both sides of the chamber (6 ml per side), each chamber is then placed into the diffusion apparatus. This equilibrates the chambers to 37\u00b0 C. and enables gas (5% CO2 in air) to be continuously pumped through the chambers thus ensuring movement of the media. 100 microliters of radiolabelled water (3H) is added to the left-hand side of each chamber and 50 microliters samples taken for 90 minutes at 3-minute intervals from the right hand side. DMEM (50 microliters) is replaced into the right hand side after each sample. Samples are then placed into scintillation vials containing 4 ml of scintillation fluid and the amount of radioactive label in each sample counted using a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The results for this assay are indicated in FIGS. 9-14. In addition to experiments whereby supplements have been tested in the presence of cells a control was performed in the absence of cells (FIG. 9).",
        "The rate of diffusion across the skin barrier has been reduced in cells cultured in the presence of the foodstuff. This data indicates that incubation of the cells in the presence of the foodstuff reduced trans-epidermal water loss through the skin surface (as indicated by a decreased rate of diffusion). This data also shows that the foodstuff promoted the formation and optimisation of a functional skin barrier.",
        "The second assay format is an in vitro barrier function diffusion assay. The system works by testing the diffusion rate of an aqueous radiolabelled marker across a barrier, in the form of a monolayer of keratinocytes. There is an inverse relation between the diffusion rate of the marker and the quality of the barrier formed by the keratinocytes. This is a near physiologic measure of barrier function.",
        "Further detail of how the keratinocytes were obtained as well as the assay formats follows.",
        "Keratinocyte Proliferation Assay",
        "In order to test whether any of the supplements had the effect of increasing keratinocyte cell division a proliferation assay was performed. Cells are seeded at 5\u00d7104 per well in collagen coated plates and cultured under proliferation promoting conditions (with Bovine Pituitary Extract, BPE) for 72 hours. The medium is then changed to one without BPE and the supplements added in its stead. Following a further 24 hours 5 microliters of 3H-Thymidine is added (37 MBq/ml) to each well. Cells are incubated in the presence of radiolabel for 24 hours and then harvested with Trypsin. Following harvesting, cells were precipitated in cold 10% tricarboxylic acid (TCA), with two follow up washes of the pellet in cold 5% TCA. Finally the pellet was resuspended in scintillant and the radioactive incorporation counted using a liquid scintillation spectrometer.",
        "Thin Layer Microscopy (TLC)",
        "FIG. 19 shows a TLC plate on which has been separated the Bligh-Dyer extracted lipid fraction of differentiated canine keratinocytes which had previously been incubated with 14C-Serine. Lane K shows the radiolabelled lipid fraction from keratinocytes. The bands were shown to be ceramides by comparison with non-radiolabelled standards run out on the same plate. The pattern of banding seen for a Bligh-Dyer extraction conducted on fibroblasts (Lane F) was different from that seen for the keratinocytes, most of the incorporation being seen for phosphatidylserine.",
        "Microscopy Pictures",
        "FIGS. 11a and 12 show micrographs taken from keratinocytes prepared for diffusion assays. FIG. 11a shows a complete layer of basal cells subjacent to layers of partially and terminally differentiated. The configuration represents a stratified in vitro epidermis. FIG. 11b shows a Transmission Electron Micrograph of the outermost layers of cells near or at terminal differentiation; the in vitro stratum corner FIG. 12 shows an area similar to FIG. 11a which has been stained with Nile Red to highlight the presence of epidermal lipids. The images shown in FIGS. 11 and 12 confirm that an in vitro epidermis has been formed and that this has developed barrier properties resembling those of normal skin.",
        "Testing the Skin Health Benefits of the Composition of the Invention Via Assessment of Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL).",
        "In order to assess the effect of the composition on skin health in dogs Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) was used. This parameter indicates the quantity of water that is being lost from the body through the skin at a given time. The amount of water exiting via this route is proportional to the quality and effectiveness of the skin as a barrier. As such, decrease in TEWL is associated with an improvement in Barrier Function.",
        "Animals",
        "32 black Labrador retrievers born between Jul. 3, 1990 and Apr. 20, 2000 The thirty-two dogs were split into two groups, a control panel and a test panel. Each group consisted of sixteen dogs. As far as possible the animals were matched between groups for sex and age.",
        "Diet",
        "The dogs were all fed a complete dry food with 100 g of chicken & beef added and mixed in.",
        "The amount of diet fed per day was calculated on an individual animal basis. The calculation used was 110 Kcal\u00d7(Bwt)0.75. This was used as a guide only; the amounts fed were adjusted as necessary to maintain a stable bodyweight.",
        "Supplement",
        "For the 12 weeks test phase, each dog on the test panel received the composition in the form of a powder. The composition was sprinkled onto the wet component of the food and mixed in.",
        "The composition consisted of the following 5 components at the concentrations given in Table 1.",

        "Trial Design",
        "During the week before the pre-feed commenced all dogs were bathed using Greenfields conditioning shampoo. All dogs were bathed again using the same shampoo during the first week of the test phase. All dogs were groomed once a week with a comb for two minutes.",
        "The trial was run for a total of 20 weeks, 8 weeks pre-feed followed by a 12 weeks test phase.",
        "Beginning of Pre-Feed",
        "During the 8 weeks pre-feed the dogs were fed on the complete food. During the first week of the pre-feed, TEWL measurements were taken from all dogs",
        "End of Pre-Feed",
        "During the last week of the pre-feed TEWL was performed on all dogs",
        "Test Phase",
        "During the 12 weeks test phase all dogs were fed on the complete food. The test panel also received the composition in the form of a powder. TEWL measurements were taken during weeks 3, 6, 9 and 12 of the test phase.",
        "TEWL Measurements",
        "On each TEWL session 5 readings were taken from each dog using twin probes (providing 10 readings in total) under conditions of consistent temperature and humidity.",
        "A set of TEWL readings was taken from the lower back. The hair was carefully parted in order to provide good contact between the probes and the skin.",
        "The dogs were exercised as normal throughout the trial. On days when TEWL measurements were undertaken the dogs were kept dry until the measurements had been performed.",
        "Veterinary Examinations",
        "All dogs underwent a full veterinary examination prior to starting the trial.",
        "Data Analysis",
        "Comparisons between Transepidermal water loss measurements were performed by two-sample comparison using the Kruskal-Wallis test.",
        "Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL)",
        "Previous validation work performed with the Dermalab TEWL meter has demonstrated that it is optimal to perform eight readings for a subject on a given site at a given time point in order to stabilise the standard error. Validation has also demonstrated that the most reliable body site for performing TEWL readings is on the back just lateral to the dorsal spine. This location is easily accessible, flat and, assuming the animal is kept away from atmospheric sources of moisture, least likely to become wet (for example due to licking\u2014exogenous forms of moisture on the skin and coat will cause erroneously high readings).",
        "No difference was observed for TEWL values between the control and test panels at the start of the trial or after the eight weeks pre-feed (Table 2). No differences were seen either for any of the groups following 3 and 6 weeks of the test feeding phase. However, after 9 weeks of the test phase a significant difference in TEWL was observed between the test and control group for readings taken on the dorsal back (P=0.048). Following twelve weeks of the test feed (End of trial) a greater difference between the test and control diet for the dorsal spine reading was observed (0.007).",

        "It has been demonstrated that feeding the composition of the invention can significantly reduce canine transepidermal water loss. A significant improvement in barrier function, as evidenced by reduced TEWL, is first observed following nine weeks of feeding the composition (P<0.05). Barrier function was found to be further improved after a subsequent 3 weeks of the test feed (12 weeks total, P<0.01). It is understood in dermatology that reduced water egress from the skin via TEWL correlates directly with increased epidermal resistance to penetration of environmental agents. This, in turn, will increase the ability of skin to resist disease leading to an improvement of overall health. It is widely accepted that skin disease is a major issue with domestic dogs. Therefore, the provision of this dietary intervention represents a significant step forward in the promotion of natural defences and health in these animals."
