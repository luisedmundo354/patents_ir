        "The promise of silicon-based optoelectronics has spurred intense interest in silicon nanoparticles (np-Si). Direct band gap transitions have been observed for np-Si. For example, stable photoluminescence (PL), tunable in the range between 700 and 350 nm, has been reported for np-Si smaller in size than the excitonic radius for bulk Si, which is about 4 nm. np-Si have been produced using a variety of techniques including colloidal growth, aerosol processes, plasma synthesis, and electrochemical etching. Many of these techniques involve a capping agent for protection from uncontrolled oxidation which, however, may introduce surface recombination states that alter the emission characteristics. From this perspective, aerosol techniques have an advantage since particles can be grown without capping agents and deposited directly onto a substrate.",
        "FIG. 1 shows simplified conventional aerosol processes. Within an aerosol flow reactor, the following processes occur at different time scales and locations. For example, initial nucleation of particles results from the formation of a supersaturated vapor of gas precursors. Possible means of generating a vapor source include pyrolysis, laser ablation, spark ablation, and plasmas. In the early stages, particles grow by condensation of vapor at their surface and coalescent coagulation. Normally, these processes occur in a region near the vapor source where the temperature is high. As the particle concentration increases, collisions between particles become more frequent and agglomeration begins. Formation of these undesirable aggregates is usually found away from the vapor source as the temperature drops off. Hence the particles synthesized by the conventional aerosol processes often have a broad size distribution, which often necessitates post-synthesis size-selection and particle agglomeration. Notably, production of blue-light emitting np-Si has been challenging because of difficulties in limiting aerosol growth to small sizes and preventing particle coagulation.",

In another example, placing the gas inlet 232 on the anode side can improve uniformity of the gas 324 flowing into the anode.",
        "According to another embodiment, an inert gas 324 flows through the gas inlet 232 to regions outside of the cathode 210 within the system 200. In one embodiment, the inert gas 324 is argon. For example, an argon gas with 99.9995% purity is run through a copper getter gas purifier heated to 350\u00b0 c. to completely remove oxygen before flowing into the plasma microreactor 200. In another embodiment, the gas 324 has a flow rate approximately three times larger than the gas mixture 322.",
        "According to yet another embodiment, silicon nanoparticles are made with the system 200 according to the method 300. For example, the gas mixture 322 includes silane and argon. The synthesized nanoparticles can be either positive charged or negative charged. For both charge polarities, the silicon nanoparticles are characterized by the size classifier  270 and the electrometer 280. For example, the size classifier 270 includes a radial differential mobility analyzer (RDMA).",

One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. For example, in the system 200, the sealing tube 230 does not include the gas inlet 232. In another example, in the method 300, at the process 320, the gas 324 is not provided.",
        "FIG. 4 shows simplified size distributions of silicon nanoparticles as classified by RDMA for two silane concentrations according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized by the method 300 with the system  200. For example, the total flow rate of the gas 322 is about 150 sccm, and the argon quench gas 324 has a flow rate of about 450 sccm. The electrode gap 224 is about 1-mm long, and the discharge current is about 6 mA. As shown in FIG. 4, curves 410 and 430 each correspond to negatively charged particles, and curves 420 and 440 each correspond to positively charged particles. Additionally, the curves 410 and 420 each correspond to a silane concentration of 2.5 ppm, and the curves 430 and 440 each correspond to a silane concentration of 4.0 ppm.",
        "For the RDMA, the particle size measurement is based on their electrical mobility in a carrier gas and thus, corresponds to the projected area of the aerosol nanoparticles. In the range of silane concentrations explored here, the discharge is stable and the particle size distributions are reproducible. Below a silane concentration of 1 ppm, particles can not be detected. For example, the particles are smaller than the 2.5 nm detection limit of the RDMA. As the silane concentration is raised from 2.5 to 4.0 ppm, the mean particle size increases and the size distribution broadens significantly. Fitting to a log-normal distribution has provided estimates of the geometric mean diameter (Dg) and standard deviation (\u03c3g). At a silane concentration of 2.5 ppm, Dg and \u03c3g have been found to be 2.9 nm and 1.32, respectively. The observed \u03c3g compares favorably with values measured by other growth processes without size-selection. Increasing the silane concentration to 4.0 ppm increases Dg and \u03c3g to 6.2 nm and 1.45, respectively. The observed dependencies and the overall shape of the size distributions are consistent with particle growth by coagulation. As shown in FIG. 4, more positively-charged particles are detected. This is consistent with silicon cluster nucleation in low-pressure discharges where photo-detachment studies have found very little negative charge on crystallites smaller than 2 nm. Remarkably, the peak number density for each charge polarity does not change appreciably with silane concentration. The latter observation suggests that the particle density exceeds that of ions and electrons in the discharge available for attachment, thus most of the particles should be at most singly charged. Large particles such as ones larger than 10 nm charge up negatively in a plasma as a result of the larger electron mobility. Thus, observation of both charge polarities corroborates the existence of very small particles.",
        "In another embodiment, vapor-phase synthesis of nanoparticles enables coupling of the reactor setup with aerosol instrumentation that measures the size and distribution of particles in situ. For example, size-classification is performed using a radial differential mobility analyzer (RDMA).

This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications.",
        "As shown in FIG. 5, an RDMA 500 includes a capacitor in which charged aerosol particles migrate in an electric field across a laminar flow of sheath gas. The aerosol stream enters the RDMA 500 at a position on the outer radius and flows inward towards the center where the classified aerosol is collected. The particle size measurement is based on their electrical mobility in the carrier gas and thus, corresponds to the projected area of the aerosol particles. For a given voltage, particles within a narrow range of mobilities transverse the gap between the electrodes and are extracted by a sampling orifice opposite to the aerosol inlet. Particles with higher mobilities deposit on the bottom electrode. Particles with too low mobility are carried out with the excess sheath gas flow. By varying the voltage, particles of different mobilities are transmitted through the instrument. The concentration of classified nanoparticles is measured by flowing the aerosol into the electrometer 280. Combined operation of the RDMA 500 used as the size classifier 270 and the electrometer 280 allows determination of the nanoparticle size distribution. As shown in FIG. 5, values for Qa, Qsh, Qs, and Qe are, for example, equal to 600 sccm, 5.5 slm, 600 sccm, and 5.5 slm, respectively.",
        "To impart a known charge distribution on particles, the aerosol is normally passed through a bipolar charger (sealed 85Kr-\u03b2 source), commonly referred to as a \u201cneutralizer,\u201d before entering the RDMA. For particles in the size range explored here, the neutralizer has been found to cause growth by agglomeration. FIG. 6 shows simplified sizes of silicon nanoparticles with and without a neutralizer in-line according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized by the method 300 with the system 200. A curve 610 corresponds a size distribution without a neutralizer, and a curve 620 corresponds to a size distribution with a neutralizer. When a neutralizer is used, the measured size distribution appeared broad with an extended tail indicating a coagulated aerosol. A narrower size distribution with a smaller mean diameter is obtained by removing the neutralizer and collecting plasma-charged particles directly. The residence time for particle growth in the plasma discharge is estimated to be on the order of 1 millisecond according to an embodiment of the present invention. At an aerosol flow rate of 600 sccm, the neutralizer increases the residence time to 10 seconds, artificially causing broadening. Shortening the residence time of particles between the reactor and size classifier should provide a more accurate representation of the distribution of particles synthesized in our process.",

The length of the gap 224 is about 1 mm, and the discharge current is about 6 mA at the process 340. For silicon nanoparticles, the flux ranges from 3.1\u00d7107 to 5.8\u00d7107/ml, which amounts about 1 \u03bcg/hour with about 600 ml/min. Curves 710, 720, 730, and 740 represent size distributions that correspond to silane concentrations of 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 ppm, respectively.

Note that in our case more positively charged particles are detected at both the low and high silane concentration as shown in FIG. 4. This is consistent with silicon cluster nucleation in low-pressure discharges where photo-detachment studies found very little negative charge on crystallites smaller than 2 nm. Large particles, such as ones equal to 10 nm, charge up negatively in a plasma as a result of the larger electron mobility. Thus, observation of both charge polarities corroborates the existence of very small particles. Remarkably, the peak number density for each charge polarity does not change appreciably with silane concentration.

For example, the neutralizer includes a bipolar charger (85Kr \u03b2). The results are obtained by approximating an empirical expression of the Fuchs model. It is apparent that particles less than 10 nm in diameter have a very low probability of acquiring more than a single charge, supporting our observations.

Films of particles are obtained by placing a molybdenum substrate in the system 200 in a stagnation flow geometry with the plasma discharge. Dispersions of particles in a solution phase can be obtained by bubbling the aerosol stream through a glass frit into a solvent that has been outgassed for 1 to 2 hours.

The aggregates appear to be made up of smaller spherical particles approximately 5 nm in diameter. These primary particles appear to be uniform in size, consistent with the narrow size distributions obtained using the RDMA. The image 1010 for electron diffraction is characteristic of an amorphous material. Since the samples have been exposed to air during loading into the TEM, oxidation of the particles may have occurred, preventing the preservation of the crystalline core. It has been reported that for particles in this size limit, such as less than 4 nm, crystal structure is difficult to observe because the surface energy is higher than the lattice energy.

This spectrum has been compared to that of a crystalline silicon substrate which shows a single sharp peak at 519 cm1. The broad shape of the peak as well as the shift from crystalline silicon confirms that deposited films are amorphous and made up of nanoparticles. For example, analysis by EDS has confirmed that the films consist of only silicon and oxygen, as shown in FIG. 12.

        "As discussed above, FIG. 14 shows the UV-visible absorbance spectrum as the curve 1410. The yellow absorption tail corresponds to the indirect gap of bulk Si. Some of the features in the spectrum, including the peak at approximately 320 nm, have also been reported for 2.0 nm Si colloids and attributed to a higher energy, direct transition. It is apparent that the absorption edge and excitation peak are at similar energies, while the emission peak is red-shifted. In general, the absorption gap in np-Si has been found to be larger than the emission gap. When light is absorbed, the particle undergoes an electronic excitation in which an electron-hole pair (exciton) is formed. Recombination of the electron and hole by emission of a photon occurs at a lower energy because of structural relaxation processes in the particle. The difference between the absorption and emission energy is known as the Stokes shift:\n\nEStokes=Eabsorption\u2212Eemission\u2003\u2003(Equation 3)",
        "where Eabsorption is the energy required to excite the cluster from its ground state to the lowest excited state, Eemission is the energy released during recombination, and EStokes is the Stokes shift. From FIG. 14, the Eabsorption, Eemission, and EStokes for np-Si are approximately 3.4 eV, 2.9 eV, and 0.5 eV, respectively. The shift of the optical gap from the bulk value for Si of 1.12 eV represents the effect of quantum confinement.",
        "Assuming that the PL emission at 420 nm or 2.95 eV is excitonic, the silicon particle core size can be estimated from calculations to be less than 2 nm. This size is closer to the AFM result but significantly smaller than the RDMA measurement. The size discrepancy could be related to smaller particle agglomeration in the aerosol measurements or larger particle oxidation upon exposure to ambient air. Particles grown at higher silane concentrations, which appear to be bigger according to the RDMA, do not exhibit red-shifted PL peaks as expected from quantum confinement. Hence the short residence time in the microreactor may have limited the primary particle size in the 1-2 nm range. Larger silane concentrations result in the production of more particles in the same size range.",
        "FIG. 15 shows a simplified comparison of PL spectra according to another embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized by the method 300 with the system 200. A curve 1510 represents a spectrum corresponding to a np-Si thin film, and a curve 1520 represents a spectrum corresponding to np-Si solution. For example, the PL spectrum 1510 has been acquired at temperature using a 20-mW GaN laser at about 405 nm and collecting the emission with a 27.5-cm focal length grating spectrograph equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device detector. In another example, the np-Si thin film is deposited on molybdenum substrate. As shown in FIG. 15, the curve 1510 exhibits a peak at 511 nm with a considerable red-shift from the peak of 420 nm for the hexane suspended silicon nanoparticles. This shift may be a result of uncontrolled oxidation of the directly deposited np-Si, or the excitation at the longer wavelength. To distinguish the effect of the latter, a PL spectrum of the hexane-suspended np-Si has been collected using an excitation wavelength of 405 nm. This spectrum is represented by a curve 1520 in FIG. 15, which shows a PL peak at approximately 465 nm, smaller than that seen for the directly deposited np-Si films. The difference may have resulted from surface oxidation of the films. Apparently, the octanol-capped nanoparticles suspended in hexane are protected from oxidation. Also, the sharp peak at 438 nm in FIG. 15 is an artifact of the cut-off filter used in the set-up.",
        "FIG. 16 shows simplified PL spectra as a function of excitation wavelength according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized by the method 300 with the system 200. Curves 1610, 1620, 1630, 1640, and 1650 represent PL spectra corresponding to excitation wavelengths of 300 nm, 320 nm, 360 nm, 400 nm, and 500 nm, respectively. As shown in FIG. 16, the emission spectra of np-Si in hexane are strongly dependent on the excitation wavelength. Although excitation at 370 nm results in the maximum PL emission, luminescence has been observed at other excitation wavelengths. As the excitation is increased from 300 to 400 nm, the emission peak shifted from 370 to 450 nm. Exciting at 500 nm has resulted in virtually no visible emission. The PL shift as a function of excitation wavelength is caused by the size distribution in the sample. At longer wavelengths, larger particles with lower HOMO\u2192LUMO band gap energies are excited and the emission peak red-shifts. At wavelengths longer than 500 nm, the excitation energy is insufficient to excite any of the particles in the sample. Accordingly, the Stokes shift has been calculated as a function of the excitation wavelength as shown in Table 1.",
        "TABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmission energy and Stokes shift as a function\n\n\nof excitation energy for np-Si in hexane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcitation Energy (eV)\nEmission Energy (eV)\nStokes Shift (eV)\n\n\n\n\n\n4.12\n3.34\n0.78\n\n\n3.86\n3.25\n0.61\n\n\n3.43\n2.94\n0.49\n\n\n3.09\n2.75\n0.34\n\n\n2.47\n2.38\n0.10",
        "As the excitation energy is decreased, emission is obtained from larger particles in the sample. Therefore, the observed decrease in the Stokes shift can be inferred to be related to particle size. Calculations have shown a similar trend approximated by EStokes\u02dcD\u2212n with the Stokes shift becoming independent of the size of the cluster at diameters larger than 3 mn. Because this parameter is related to a relaxation mechanism in the particle, it depends on specific bonds at the surface. For larger particle diameters, surface states have been observed to be inconsequential to PL emission. The sensitivity of the Stokes shift to particle size suggests that the silicon nanoparticles have a diameter of about 1 to 2 nm according to certain embodiments of the present invention. Particles in this size range have important implications in studies of the PL mechanism.",
        "FIG. 17 is a simplified diagram showing quantum yield of silicon nanoparticles according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized by the method 300 with the system 200. To estimate the quantum efficiency of these nanoparticles, PL emission spectra have been collected for various particle dilutions. The integrated emission intensity for each sample is plotted in as a curve 1710 against the corresponding absorbance at the same excitation wavelength. Under the same excitation conditions, the same lamp energy, and the same spectrometer band-pass, similar measurements have also been performed for various dilutions of 9,10-diphenylanthracene in cyclohexane, which emits with a known efficiency of 90% between 400 and 500 nm. The experimental results are plotted as a curve 1720. As shown in FIG. 17, the curve 1710 has a slope of 1.6\u00d7109 based on linear fitting, and the curve 1720 has a slope of 5.78\u00d7109 also based on linear fitting. A comparison of these two slopes indicates that the quantum efficiency of the octanol-capped silicon nanoparticles is higher than 23% and equal to about 30%. As discussed above and emphasized here, the silicon nanoparticles used for this experiment are as-grown particles without any further processing or special treatments.",
        "FIG. 18 is a simplified diagram showing life time of silicon nanoparticles according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. The silicon nanoparticles are synthesized by the method 300 with the system 200. The radioactive lifetime \u03c4 of the PL emission of as-grown silicon nanoparticles have been evaluated. PL decay measurements have been performed at 295 K by exciting np-Si in hexane with an Ar ion laser at 454.8 nm with a cw power density of 5 mW/mm2 at the sample. The PL emission has been monitored at 570 nm through a cutoff filter at 500 nm. The beam has been pulsed at 1000 Hz using an acoustic optical modulator with 50% duty cycle and the data have been collected with a temporal resolution of 5 ns. The results, as shown in FIG. 18, can be approximated by a stretched exponential curve 1810 with \u03c4=30 ns and a stretch fitting parameter \u03c4=0.9. The obtained lifetime of 30 ns is longer than the lifetimes typically attributed to surface state recombination of electron-hole pairs but shorter than transitions believed to be associated with band-to-band recombination. For example, the lifetimes typically attributed to surface state recombination of electron-hole pairs are equal to or smaller than 1 ns, and transitions believed to be associated with band-to-band recombination usually take about 10 to 100 \u03bcs. While the light emission mechanism in np-Si is still under debate, it seems that both theory and experiment agree on a trend of decreasing PL lifetimes for smaller nanoparticles. For certain embodiments of the present invention, given the size of silicon nanoparticles, short lifetimes should be expected, perhaps even shorter than the 30 ns measured, which is based on an excitation wavelength that is significantly red-shifted from the excitation optimum.",
        "As discussed above and further emphasized here, FIGS. 2-18 are merely examples, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, alternatives, and modifications. For example, the aerosol synthesis route for nanoparticle growth can be adapted to different materials by changing the gas precursor, such as the gas 322 in FIG. 2. Consequently, the properties of silicon nanoparticles and other semiconductors can be compared. For example, while germanium is an indirect band gap material like silicon, it has a band gap energy of 0.76 eV as compared to 1.12 eV for silicon. Experimental investigations on Ge nanocrystals have shown quantum confinement effects similar to Si. Some studies have suggested that below a critical size, Ge nanoparticles should show stronger quantum confinement than Si. Measuring the PL of similarly sized particles can confirm if the band gap indeed shifts to higher energies.",

For example, atmospheric-pressure microdischarges are used as short-residence time reactors for silicon nanoparticle synthesis. In one embodiment, the residence time of particle nucleation can be limited in the reactor to time scales on the order of milliseconds. In another example, charging of particles in plasma may prevent coagulation. In yet another example, high-pressure operation can accelerates particle growth.",
        "Certain embodiments of the present invention can limit particle growth in the reaction zone allowing the production of ultrasmall nanoparticles with relatively narrow size distributions.
