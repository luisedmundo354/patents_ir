        "In some embodiments, it may be advantageous for at least a portion of a metal oxide source (in some embodiments, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or even 100 percent by weight) to be obtained by adding particulate, metallic material comprising at least one of a metal (e.g., Al, Ca, Cu, Cr, Fe, Li, Mg, Ni, Ag, Ti, Zr, and combinations thereof), M, that has a negative enthalpy of oxide formation or an alloy thereof to the melt, or otherwise combining them with the other raw materials. Although not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that the heat resulting from the exothermic reaction associated with the oxidation of the metal is beneficial in the formation of a homogeneous melt and resulting glass. For example, it is believed that the additional heat generated by the oxidation reaction within the raw material eliminates, minimizes, or at least reduces insufficient heat transfer, and hence facilitates formation and homogeneity of the melt, particularly when forming glass particles with x, y, and z dimensions over 50 (over 100, or even over 150) micrometers. It is also believed that the availability of the additional heat aids in driving various chemical reactions and physical processes (e.g., densification, and spherodization) to completion. Further, it is believed for some embodiments, the presence of the additional heat generated by the oxidation reaction actually enables the formation of a melt, which otherwise is difficult or not practical due to high melting point of the materials. Further, the presence of the additional heat generated by the oxidation reaction actually enables the formation of glass that otherwise could not be made, or could not be made in the desired size range. Another advantage of the invention includes, in forming the glasses, that many of the chemical and physical processes such as melting, densification and spherodizing can be achieved in a short time, so that very high quench rates may be achieved. For additional details, see publication No. US 2003-0110709-A1, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "In one aspect of the invention, the raw materials are fed independently to form the molten mixture. In another aspect of the invention, certain raw materials are mixed together, while other raw materials are added independently into the molten mixture. In some embodiments, for example, the raw materials are combined or mixed together prior to melting. The raw materials may be combined in any suitable and known manner to form a substantially homogeneous mixture. These combining techniques include ball milling, mixing, tumbling and the like. The milling media in the ball mill may be metal balls, ceramic balls and the like. The ceramic milling media may be, for example, alumina, zirconia, silica, magnesia and the like. The ball milling may occur dry, in an aqueous environment, or in a solvent-based (e.g., isopropyl alcohol) environment. If the raw material batch contains metal powders, then it is generally desired to use a solvent during milling. This solvent may be any suitable material with the appropriate flash point and ability to disperse the raw materials. The milling time may be from a few minutes to a few days, generally between a few hours to 24 hours. In a wet or solvent based milling system, the liquid medium is removed, typically by drying, so that the resulting mixture is typically homogeneous and substantially devoid of the water and/or solvent. If a solvent based milling system is used, during drying, a solvent recovery system may be employed to recycle the solvent. After drying, the resulting mixture may be in the form of a \u201cdried cake\u201d. This cake-like mixture may then be broken up or crushed into the desired particle size prior to melting. Alternatively, for example, spray-drying techniques may be used. The latter typically provides spherical particulates of a desired oxide mixture. The precursor material may also be prepared by wet chemical methods including precipitation and sol-gel. Such methods will be beneficial if extremely high levels of homogeneity are desired.",
        "Particulate raw materials are typically selected to have particle sizes such that the formation of a homogeneous melt can be achieved rapidly. Typically, raw materials with relatively small average particle sizes and narrow distributions are used for this purpose. In some methods (e.g., flame forming and plasma spraying), particularly desirable particulate raw materials are those having an average particle size in a range from about 5 nm to about 50 micrometers (in some embodiments, in a range from about 10 nm to about 20 micrometers, or even about 15 nm to about 1 micrometer), wherein at least 90 (in some embodiments, 95, or even 100) percent by weight of the particulate is the raw material, although sizes outside of the sizes and ranges may also be useful. Particulate less than about 5 nm in size tends to be difficult to handle (e.g., the flow properties of the feed particles tended to be undesirable as they tend to have poor flow properties). Use of particulate larger than about 50 micrometers in typical flame forming or plasma spraying processes tend to make it more difficult to obtain homogenous melts and glasses and/or the desired composition.",
        "Furthermore, in some cases, for example, when particulate material is fed in to a flame or thermal or plasma spray apparatus to form the melt, it may be desirable for the particulate raw materials to be provided in a range of particle sizes. Although not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that this maximizes the packing density and strength of the feed particles. If the raw material powders are too coarse, the feed and resulting melt particles may not have the desired composition or uniformity. In general, the coarsest raw material particles should be smaller than the desired melt or glass particle sizes. Further, raw material particles that are too coarse, tend to have insufficient thermal and mechanical stresses in the feed particles, for example, during a flame forming or plasma spraying step. The end result in such cases is generally fracturing of the feed particles in to smaller fragments, loss of compositional uniformity, loss of yield in desired glass particle sizes, or even incomplete melting as the fragments generally change their trajectories in a multitude of directions out of the heat source.",
        "The glasses and ceramics comprising glass can be made, for example, by heating (including in a flame or plasma) the appropriate metal oxide sources to form a melt, (desirably a homogenous melt) and then cooling the melt to provide glass. Some embodiments of glasses can be made, for example, by melting the metal oxide sources in any suitable furnace (e.g., an inductively or resistively heated furnace, a gas-fired furnace, or an electric arc furnace).",
        "The glass is typically obtained by relatively rapidly cooling the molten material (i.e., the melt). The quench rate (i.e., the cooling time) to obtain the glass depends upon many factors, including the chemical composition of the melt, the glass-forming ability of the components, the thermal properties of the melt and the resulting glass, the processing technique(s), the dimensions and mass of the resulting glass, and the cooling technique. In general, relatively higher quench rates are required to form glasses comprising higher amounts of Al2O3 (i.e., greater than 75 percent by weight Al2O3), especially in the absence of known glass formers such as SiO2, B2O3, P2O5, GeO2, TeO2, As2O3, and V2O5. Similarly, it is more difficult to cool melts into glasses in larger dimensions, as it is more difficult to remove heat fast enough.",
        "In some embodiments of the invention, the raw materials are heated into a molten state in a particulate form and subsequently cooled into glass particles. Typically, the particles have a particle size greater than 25 micrometers (in some embodiments, greater than 50, 100, 150, or even 200 micrometers).",
        "The quench rates achieved in making glasses according to the methods of the present invention are believed to be higher than 102, 103, 104, 105 or even 106\u00b0 C./sec (i.e., a temperature drop of 1000\u00b0 C. from a molten state in less than 10 seconds, less than a second, less than a tenth of a second, less than a hundredth of a second or even less than a thousandth of a second, respectively). Techniques for cooling the melt include discharging the melt into a cooling media (e.g., high velocity air jets, liquids (e.g., cold water), metal plates (including chilled metal plates), metal rolls (including chilled metal rolls), metal balls (including chilled metal balls), and the like). Other cooling techniques known in the art include roll-chilling. Roll-chilling can be carried out, for example, by melting the metal oxide sources at a temperature typically 20-200\u00b0 C. higher than the melting point, and cooling/quenching the melt by spraying it under high pressure (e.g., using a gas such as air, argon, nitrogen or the like) onto a high-speed rotary roll(s). Typically, the rolls are made of metal and are water-cooled. Metal book molds may also be useful for cooling/quenching the melt.",
        "The cooling rate is believed to affect the properties of the quenched glass. For instance, glass transition temperature, density and other properties of glass typically change with cooling rates.",
        "Rapid cooling may also be conducted under controlled atmospheres, such as a reducing, neutral, or oxidizing environment to maintain and/or influence the desired oxidation states, etc. during cooling. The atmosphere can also influence glass formation by influencing crystallization kinetics from undercooled liquid. For example, larger undercooling of Al2O3 melts without crystallization has been reported in argon atmosphere as compared to that in air.",
        "In one method, glasses and ceramics comprising glass can be made utilizing flame fusion as reported, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,254,981 (Castle). In this method, the metal oxide sources are fed (e.g., in the form of particles, sometimes referred to as \u201cfeed particles\u201d) directly into a burner (e.g., a methane-air burner, an acetylene-oxygen burner, a hydrogen-oxygen burner, and the like), and then quenched, for example, in water, cooling oil, air, or the like. The size of feed particles fed into the flame generally determines the size of the resulting particles comprising glass.",
        "Some embodiments of glasses can also be obtained by other techniques, such as: laser spin melting with free fall cooling, Taylor wire technique, plasmatron technique, hammer and anvil technique, centrifugal quenching, air gun splat cooling, single roller and twin roller quenching, roller-plate quenching, and pendant drop melt extraction (see, e.g., Rapid Solidification of Ceramics, Brockway et al., Metals And Ceramics Information Center, A Department of Defense Information Analysis Center, Columbus, Ohio, January, 1984). Some embodiments of glasses may also be obtained by other techniques, such as: thermal (including flame or laser or plasma-assisted) pyrolysis of suitable precursors, physical vapor synthesis (PVS) of metal precursors and mechanochemical processing.",
        "Other techniques for forming melts, cooling/quenching melts, and/or otherwise forming glass include vapor phase quenching, plasma spraying, melt-extraction, and gas or centrifugal atomization. Vapor phase quenching can be carried out, for example, by sputtering, wherein the metal alloys or metal oxide sources are formed into a sputtering target(s). The target is fixed at a predetermined position in a sputtering apparatus, and a substrate(s) to be coated is placed at a position opposing the target(s). At typical pressures of 10\u22123 torr of oxygen gas and Ar gas, a discharge is generated between the target(s) and substrate(s), and Ar or oxygen ions collide against the target to cause reaction sputtering, thereby depositing a film of composition on the substrate. For additional details regarding plasma spraying, see, for example publication No. US 2004-0023078-A1, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "Gas atomization involves heating feed particles to convert them to a melt. A thin stream of such melt is atomized through contact with a disruptive air jet (i.e., the stream is divided into fine droplets). The resulting substantially discrete, generally ellipsoidal glass particles (e.g., beads) are then recovered. Examples of bead sizes include those having a diameter in a range of about 5 micrometers to about 3 mm. Melt-extraction can be carried out, for example, as reported in U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,870 (Strom-Olsen et al.). Container-less glass forming techniques utilizing laser beam heating as reported, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,482,758 (Weber), may also be useful in making the glass.",
        "Typically, glass-ceramics made according to the present invention, and some glasses and ceramics comprising glasses used to make such glass-ceramics, have x, y, and z dimensions each perpendicular to each other, and wherein each of the x, y, and z dimensions are at least 10 micrometers. In some embodiments, the x, y, and z dimensions are at least 30 micrometers, 35 micrometers, 40 micrometers, 45 micrometers, 50 micrometers, 75 micrometers, 100 micrometers, 150 micrometers, 200 micrometers, 250 micrometers, 500 micrometers, 1000 micrometers, 2000 micrometers, 2500 micrometers, 5 mm, or even at least 10 mm, if coalesced. The x, y, and z dimensions of a material are determined either visually or using microscopy, depending on the magnitude of the dimensions. The reported z dimension is, for example, the diameter of a sphere, the thickness of a coating, or the shortest dimension of a prismatic shape.",
        "The addition of certain other metal oxides may alter the properties and/or crystalline structure or microstructure of glass-ceramics made according to the present invention, as well as the processing of the raw materials and intermediates in making the ceramic. For example, oxide additions such as CaO, Li2O, MgO, and Na2O have been observed to alter both the Tg and Tx (wherein Tx is the crystallization temperature) of glass. Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that such additions influence glass formation. Further, for example, such oxide additions may decrease the melting temperature of the overall system (i.e., drive the system toward lower melting eutectic), and ease glass formation. Compositions based upon complex eutectics in multi-component systems (quaternary, etc.) may have better glass-forming ability. The viscosity of the liquid melt and viscosity of the glass in its' working range may also be affected by the addition of metal oxides other than the particular required oxide(s).",
        "Crystallization of glasses and ceramics comprising the glass to form glass-ceramics may also be affected by the additions of materials. For example, certain metals, metal oxides (e.g., titanates and zirconates), and fluorides may act as nucleation agents resulting in beneficial heterogeneous nucleation of crystals. Also, addition of some oxides may change the nature of metastable phases devitrifying from the glass upon reheating. In another aspect, for glass-ceramics made according to the present invention comprising crystalline ZrO2, it may be desirable to add metal oxides (e.g., Y2O3, TiO2, CeO2, CaO, and MgO) that are known to stabilize the tetragonal/cubic form of ZrO2.",
        "The particular selection of metal oxide sources and other additives for making glass-ceramics made according to the present invention typically takes into account, for example, the desired composition, the microstructure, the degree of crystallinity, the physical properties (e.g., hardness or toughness), the presence of undesirable impurities, and the desired or required characteristics of the particular process (including equipment and any purification of the raw materials before and/or during fusion and/or solidification) being used to prepare the ceramics.",
        "In some instances, it may be preferred to incorporate limited amounts of metal oxides selected from the group consisting of: B2O3, Na2O, P2O5, SiO2, TeO2, V2O5, and combinations thereof. Sources, including commercial sources, include the oxides themselves, complex oxides, elemental (e.g., Si) powders, ores, carbonates, acetates, nitrates, chlorides, hydroxides, etc. These metal oxides may be added, for example, to modify a physical property of the resulting glass-ceramic and/or improve processing. These metal oxides, when used, are typically added from greater than 0 to 20% by weight collectively (in some embodiments, greater than 0 to 5% by weight collectively, or even greater than 0 to 2% by weight collectively) of the glass-ceramic depending, for example, upon the desired property.",
        "The microstructure or phase composition (glassy/crystalline) of a material can be determined in a number of ways. Various information can be obtained using optical microscopy, electron microscopy, differential thermal analysis (DTA), and x-ray diffraction (XRD), for example.",
        "Using optical microscopy, amorphous material is typically predominantly transparent due to the lack of light scattering centers such as crystal boundaries, while crystalline material shows a crystalline structure and is opaque due to light scattering effects.",
        "A percent amorphous (or glass) yield can be calculated for particles (e.g., beads), etc. using a \u2212100+120 mesh size fraction (i.e., the fraction collected between 150-micrometer opening size and 125-micrometer opening size screens). The measurements are done in the following manner. A single layer of particles, beads, etc. is spread out upon a glass slide. The particles, beads, etc. are observed using an optical microscope. Using the crosshairs in the optical microscope eyepiece as a guide, particles, beads, etc. that lay along a straight line are counted either amorphous or crystalline depending on their optical clarity. A total of 500 particles, beads, etc. are typically counted, although fewer particles, beads, etc. may be used and a percent amorphous yield is determined by the amount of amorphous particles, beads, etc. divided by total particles, beads, etc. counted. Embodiments of methods according to the present invention have percent amorphous (or glass) yields of at least 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or even 100 percent.",
        "If it is desired for all the particles to be amorphous (or glass), and the resulting yield is less than 100%, the amorphous (or glass) particles may be separated from the non-amorphous (or non-glass) particles. Such separation may be done, for example, by any conventional techniques, including separating based upon density or optical clarity.",
        "Using DTA, the material is classified as amorphous if the corresponding DTA trace of the material contains an exothermic crystallization event (Tx). If the same trace also contains an endothermic event (Tg) at a temperature lower than Tx it is considered to include a glass phase. If the DTA trace of the material contains no such events, it is considered to contain crystalline phases.",
        "Differential thermal analysis (DTA) can be conducted using the following method. DTA runs can be made (using an instrument such as that obtained from Netzsch Instruments, Selb, Germany under the trade designation \u201cNETZSCH STA 409 DTA/TGA\u201d) using a \u2212140+170 mesh size fraction (i.e., the fraction collected between 105-micrometer opening size and 90-micrometer opening size screens). An amount of each screened sample (typically about 400 milligrams (mg)) is placed in a 100-microliter Al2O3 sample holder. Each sample is heated in static air at a rate of 10\u00b0 C./minute from room temperature (about 25\u00b0 C.) to 1100\u00b0 C.",

Furthermore, XRD can be used qualitatively to determine types of phases. The presence of a broad diffuse intensity peak is taken as an indication of the amorphous nature of a material. The existence of both a broad peak and well-defined peaks is taken as an indication of existence of crystalline matter within a glass matrix.",
        "The initially formed glass or ceramic (including glass prior to crystallization) may be larger in size than that desired. If the glass is in a desired geometric shape and/or size, size reduction is typically not needed. The glass or ceramic can be converted into smaller pieces using crushing and/or comminuting techniques known in the art, including roll crushing, jaw crushing, hammer milling, ball milling, jet milling, impact crushing, and the like. In some instances, it is desired to have two or multiple crushing steps. For example, after the ceramic is formed (solidified), it may be in the form of larger than desired. The first crushing step may involve crushing these relatively large masses or \u201cchunks\u201d to form smaller pieces. This crushing of these chunks may be accomplished with a hammer mill, impact crusher or jaw crusher. These smaller pieces may then be subsequently crushed to produce the desired particle size distribution. In order to produce the desired particle size distribution (sometimes referred to as grit size or grade), it may be necessary to perform multiple crushing steps. In general the crushing conditions are optimized to achieve the desired particle shape(s) and particle size distribution. Resulting particles that are not of the desired size may be re-crushed if they are too large, or \u201crecycled\u201d and used as a raw material for re-melting if they are too small.",
        "The shape of particles can depend, for example, on the composition and/or microstructure of the ceramic, the geometry in which it was cooled, and the manner in which the ceramic is crushed (i.e., the crushing technique used). In general, where a \u201cblocky\u201d shape is preferred, more energy may be employed to achieve this shape. Conversely, where a \u201csharp\u201d shape is preferred, less energy may be employed to achieve this shape. The crushing technique may also be changed to achieve different desired shapes. For some particles an average aspect ratio ranging from 1:1 to 5:1 is typically desired, and in some embodiments, 1.25:1 to 3:1, or even 1.5:1 to 2.5:1.",
        "It is also within the scope of the present invention, for example, to directly form articles in desired shapes. For example, desired articles may be formed (including molded) by pouring or forming the melt into a mold. Also see, for example, the forming techniques described in application having U.S. Ser. No. 10/358,772, filed Feb. 5, 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "Embodiments of glasses and glass-ceramics made according to the present invention can be obtained without limitations in dimensions. This was found to be possible through a coalescing step performed at a temperature above the glass transition temperature. This coalescing step in essence forms a larger sized body from two or more smaller particles. For instance, as evident from FIG. 8, a glass undergoes glass transition (Tg) before significant crystallization occurs (Tx) as evidenced by the existence of an endotherm (Tg) at lower temperature than an exotherm (Tx). For example, ceramic (including glass prior to crystallization), may also be provided by heating, for example, particles comprising the glass, and/or fibers, etc. above the Tg such that the particles, etc. coalesce to form a shape. The temperature and pressure used for coalescing may depend, for example, upon composition of the glass and the desired density of the resulting material. The temperature should be greater than the glass transition temperature. In certain embodiments, the heating is conducted at at least one temperature in a range of about 650\u00b0 C. to about 1100\u00b0 C. (in some embodiments, 675\u00b0 C. to 850\u00b0 C.). Typically, the glass is under pressure (e.g., greater than zero to 1 GPa or more) during coalescence to aid the coalescence of the glass. In one embodiment, a charge of the particles, etc. is placed into a die and hot-pressing is performed at temperatures above glass transition where viscous flow of glass leads to coalescence into a relatively large part. Examples of typical coalescing techniques include hot pressing, hot isostatic pressing, hot extrusion, hot forging and the like (e.g., sintering, plasma assisted sintering). For example, particles comprising glass (obtained, for example, by crushing) (including beads and microspheres), fibers, etc. may be formed into a larger particle size. Coalescing may also result in a body shaped into a desired form. In some embodiments, it is desirable to cool the resulting coalesced body before further heat treatment. After heat treatment if so desired, the coalesced body may be crushed to smaller particle sizes or a desired particle size distribution.",
        "In general, heat-treatment can be carried out in any of a variety of ways, including those known in the art for heat-treating glass to provide glass-ceramics. For example, heat-treatment can be conducted in batches, for example, using resistive, inductively or gas heated furnaces. Alternatively, for example, heat-treatment (or a portion thereof) can be conducted continuously, for example, using a rotary kiln, fluidized bed furnaces, or pendulum kiln. In the case of a rotary kiln or a pendulum kiln, the material is typically fed directly into the kiln operating at the elevated temperature. In the case of a fluidized bed furnace, the glass to be heat-treated is typically suspended in a gas (e.g., air, inert, or reducing gasses). The time at the elevated temperature may range from a few seconds (in some embodiments, even less than 5 seconds) to a few minutes to several hours. The temperature typically ranges from the Tx of the glass to 1600\u00b0 C., more typically from 750\u00b0 C. to 1600\u00b0 C., and in some embodiments, from 1200\u00b0 C. to 1500\u00b0 C. It is also within the scope of the present invention to perform some of the heat-treatment in multiple steps (e.g., one for nucleation, and another for crystal growth; wherein densification also typically occurs during the crystal growth step). When a multiple step heat-treatment is carried out, it is typically desired to control either or both the nucleation and the crystal growth rates. In general, during most ceramic processing operations, it is desired to obtain maximum densification without significant crystal growth. Although not wanting to be bound by theory, in general, it is believed in the ceramic art that larger crystal sizes lead to reduced mechanical properties while finer average crystallite sizes lead to improved mechanical properties (e.g., higher strength and higher hardness). In particular, it is very desirable to form ceramics with densities of at least 90, 95, 97, 98, 99, or even 100 percent of theoretical density, wherein the average crystal sizes are less than 0.15 micrometer, or even less than 0.1 micrometer.",
        "In some embodiments of the present invention, the glasses or ceramics comprising glass may be annealed prior to heat-treatment. In such cases annealing is typically done at a temperature less than the Tx of the glass for a time from a few second to few hours or even days. Typically, the annealing is done for a period of less than 3 hours, or even less than an hour. Optionally, annealing may also be carried out in atmospheres other than air. Furthermore, different stages (i.e., the nucleation step and the crystal growth step) of the heat-treatment may be carried out under different atmospheres. It is believed that the Tg and Tx, as well as the Tx-Tg of the glasses may shift depending on the atmospheres used during the heat treatment.",
        "One skilled in the art can determine the appropriate conditions from a Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) study of the glass using techniques known in the art. One skilled in the art, after reading the disclosure of the present invention should be able to provide TTT curves for glasses used to make glass-ceramics according to the present invention, determine the appropriate nucleation and/or crystal growth conditions to provide glass-ceramics according to the present invention.",
        "Heat-treatment may occur, for example, by feeding the material directly into a furnace at the elevated temperature. Alternatively, for example, the material may be fed into a furnace at a much lower temperature (e.g., room temperature) and then heated to desired temperature at a predetermined heating rate. It is within the scope of the present invention to conduct heat-treatment in an atmosphere other than air. In some cases it might be even desirable to heat-treat in a reducing atmosphere(s). Also, for, example, it may be desirable to heat-treat under gas pressure as in, for example, hot-isostatic press, or in gas pressure furnace. Although not wanting to be bound by theory, it is believed that atmospheres may affect oxidation states of some of the components of the glasses and glass-ceramics. Such variation in oxidation states can bring about varying coloration of glasses and glass-ceramics. In addition, nucleation and crystallization steps can be affected by atmospheres (e.g., the atmosphere may affect the atomic mobilities of some species of the glasses).",
        "It is also within the scope of the present invention to conduct additional heat-treatment to further improve desirable properties of the material. For example, hot-isostatic pressing may be conducted (e.g., at temperatures from about 750\u00b0 C. to about 1400\u00b0 C.) to remove residual porosity, increasing the density of the material. It is within the scope of the present invention to convert (e.g., crush) the resulting article or heat-treated article to provide particles (e.g., abrasive particles) made according to the present invention).",
        "Typically, glass-ceramics are stronger than the glasses from which they are formed. Hence, the strength of the material may be adjusted, for example, by the degree to which the glass is converted to crystalline ceramic phase(s). Alternatively, or in addition, the strength of the material may also be affected, for example, by the number of nucleation sites created, which may in turn be used to affect the number, and in turn the size of the crystals of the crystalline phase(s). For additional details regarding forming glass-ceramics, see, for example, Glass-Ceramics, P. W. McMillan, Academic Press, Inc., 2nd edition, 1979.",
        "As compared to many other types of ceramic processing (e.g., sintering of a calcined material to a dense, sintered ceramic material), there is relatively little shrinkage (typically, less than 30 percent by volume; in some embodiments, less than 20 percent, 10 percent, 5 percent, or even less than 3 percent by volume) during crystallization of the glass to form the glass-ceramic. The actual amount of shrinkage depends, for example, on the composition of the glass, the heat-treatment time, the heat-treatment temperature, the heat-treatment pressure, the density of the glass being crystallized, the relative amount(s) of the crystalline phases formed, and the degree of crystallization. The amount of shrinkage can be measured by conventional techniques known in the art, including by dilatometry, Archimedes method, or measuring the dimensions of the material before and after heat-treatment. In some cases, there may be some evolution of volatile species during heat-treatment.",
        "In some embodiments, the relatively low shrinkage feature may be particularly advantageous. For example, articles may be formed in the glass phase to the desired shapes and dimensions (i.e., in near-net shape), followed by heat treatment to at least partially crystallize the glass. As a result, substantial cost savings associated with the manufacturing and machining of the crystallized material may be realized.",
        "In some embodiments, the glass has an x, y, z direction, each of which has a length of at least 1 cm (in some embodiments, at least 5 cm, or even at least 10 cm), wherein the glass has a volume, wherein the resulting glass-ceramic has an x, y, z direction, each of which has a length of at least 1 cm (in some embodiments, at least 5 cm, or even at least 10 cm), wherein the glass-ceramic has a volume of at least 70 (in some embodiments, at least 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 96, or even at least 97) percent of the glass volume.",

        "Optical waveguides according to the present invention may be made generally by fabrication means known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, a channel waveguide (see FIG. 2) may be fabricated by depositing a doped glass layer on a low-index cladding, followed by photo-lithography and etching to define a line. The lithography is usually followed by the deposition of a low index top cladding. A ridge waveguide (see FIG. 3) is similar to a channel waveguide except that the doped glass layer is not fully etched back. A strip-loaded waveguide (see FIG. 4) may be made by placing a strip of low-index cladding on a planar layer of doped glass. A diffused waveguide (see FIG. 5) may be made by indiffusing a doped glass into the low-index substrate.

        "For each example, about 400 grams of zirconia milling media (obtained from Tosoh Ceramics, Division of Bound Brook, NJ under the trade designation \u201cYTZ\u201d) were added to the bottle along with 100 ml distilled and deionized water. The mixture was milled for 24 hours at 120 rpm. After the milling, the milling media were removed and the slurry was poured onto a glass (\u201cPYREX\u201d) pan where it was dried using a heat-gun. Before melting in a flame, dried particles were calcined at 1300\u00b0 C. for 1 hour in air in an electrically heated furnace (obtained under the trade designation \u201cModel KKSK-666-3100\u201d from Keith Furnaces of Pico Rivera, Calif.).",
        "After grinding with a mortar and pestle, a portion of the calcined particles were fed into a hydrogen/oxygen torch flame. The hydrogen torch used to melt the multiphase particles, thereby generating a melted glass bead, was a Bethlehem bench burner (PM2D Model B obtained from Bethlehem Apparatus Co., Hellertown, Pa.). For the inner ring, the hydrogen flow rate was 8 standard liters per minute (SLPM), the oxygen flow rate was 3 SLPM. For the outer ring, the hydrogen flow rate was 23 standard liters per minute (SLPM), the oxygen flow rate was 9.8 SLPM. The dried and sized particles were fed directly into the hydrogen torch flame, where they were melted and transported to an inclined stainless steel surface (approximately 20 inches wide with the slope angle of 45 degrees) with cold water running over (approximately 8 l/min.).",
        "The resulting molten and quenched particles were collected in a pan and dried at 110\u00b0 C. The particles were spherical in shape and varied in size from a few tens of micrometers up to 250 micrometers.",
        "A percent amorphous yield was calculated from the resulting flame-formed beads using a \u2212100+120 mesh size fraction (i.e., the fraction collected between 150-micrometer opening size and 125-micrometer opening size screens). The measurements were done in the following manner. A single layer of beads was spread out upon a glass slide. The beads were observed using an optical microscope. Using the crosshairs in the optical microscope eyepiece as a guide, beads that lay horizontally coincident with the crosshair along a straight line were counted either amorphous or crystalline depending on their optical clarity (i.e., they were amorphous if clear). A total of 500 beads were counted and a percent amorphous yield was determined by the amount of amorphous beads divided by total beads counted. The amorphous yield data for the flame formed beads of Examples 1-26 are reported in Table 1, above.",
        "For differential thermal analysis (DTA), a material was screened to retain beads (microspheres) in the 90-125 micrometer size range. DTA runs were made (using an instrument obtained from Netzsch Instruments, Selb, Germany under the trade designation \u201cNETZSCH STA 409 DTA/TGA\u201d. The amount of each screened sample placed in the 100 microliter Al2O3 sample holder was 400 milligrams. Sample were heated in static air at a rate of 10\u00b0 C./minute from room temperature (about 25\u00b0 C.) to 1200\u00b0 C.",
        "Referring to FIG. 8, line 801 is the plotted DTA data for the Example 1 material. Referring to FIG. 8 line 801, the material exhibited an endothermic event at a temperature around 696\u00b0 C., as evidenced by the downward curve of line 801. It was believed that this event was due to the glass transition (Tg) of the material. At about 781\u00b0 C., an exothermic event was observed as evidenced by the sharp peak in line 801. It was believed that this event was due to the crystallization (Tx) of the material. The Tg and Tx values for other examples are reported in Table 1, above.",
        "Portions of beads of Examples 1 and 7 were heat-treated in a furnace (an electrically heated furnace (obtained under the trade designation \u201cModel KKSK-666-3100\u201d from Keith Furnaces of Pico Rivera, Calif.)) to provide Examples 27 and 28, respectively, as follows. The beads were heated from room temperature (about 25\u00b0 C.) to about 1300\u00b0 C. at a rate of about 10\u00b0 C./min. and then held at 1300\u00b0 C. for about 1 hour. Next, the beads were cooled back to room temperature by turning off the furnace.",
        "FIGS. 9 and 10 are scanning electron microscope (SEM) photomicrographs at 15,000\u00d7 and 6,000\u00d7, respectively of polished sections of the heat-treated Example 27 and 28 materials, respectively, showing the crystalline nature of the materials. The polished sections were prepared using conventional mounting and polishing techniques. Polishing was done using a polisher (obtained from Buehler of Lake Bluff, Ill. under the trade designation \u201cECOMET 3 TYPE POLISHER-GRINDER\u201d). The samples were polished for about 3 minutes with a diamond wheel containing 125-micrometer diamonds, followed by three minutes of polishing with each of 45, 30, 15, 9, and 3 micrometers diamond slurries. The polished samples were coated with a thin layer of gold- palladium and viewed using JEOL SEM (Model JSM 840A).",
        "Four grams of Example 1 beads were placed in a graphite die and hot-pressed using a uniaxial pressing apparatus (obtained under the trade designation \u201cHP-50\u201d, Thermal Technology Inc., Brea, Calif.). The hot-pressing was carried out at 775\u00b0 C. in a nitrogen atmosphere at a pressure of 34.5 MPa (5 ksi). The resultant material was in the form of a coherent coalesced body.",
