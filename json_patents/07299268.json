Hence, a detailed description of those computers is omitted here.",
        "The operation will be described below with reference to FIGS. 4 to 12.",
        "The following description is made in connection with the case where the users of the first creating group 130, which comprises the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3 shown in FIG. 1, create an electronic album. Also, it is assumed that the user operating the creating user computer 130-1 is a host user and the users operating the creating user computers 130-2, 130-3 are guest users. (Initial Setting Process)",
        "FIG. 4 is a flowchart showing the operation of an initial setting process for creating an electronic album, including setting of category information and user information. FIG. 4 represents the operation on the side of the album server 110.",
        "First, the album server 110 prepares a template for creating an electronic album and stores the template in the template DB 207 (step S401). FIG. 10 shows one example of the template. As shown in FIG. 10, the template is made up of an image entry area 1001 in which data of images, such as photos, is to be input, text entry areas 1002, 1004 in which data of comments, such as impressions, is to be input, an advertisement entry area in which advertisement data is to be input, etc. The text entry areas include a title entry area 1004 in which a title of an electronic album is to be input, and a comment entry area 1002 in which comments (compositions) freely written by the user are to be input. Additionally, the template is prepared in plural number for each item of category information.",
        "Then, in step S402, the album server 110 prepares category information for classifying electronic albums in accordance with predetermined classes, and stores the category information in the category DB 208. The category information includes, e.g., items such as \u201ctravel\u201d and \u201cfood\u201d. Further, the category information \u201ctravel\u201d, for example, may be divided into sub-category information classified for each destination of travel, such as \u201cTahiti\u201d, \u201cMaldives\u201d or \u201cCanada\u201d.",
        "Then, the album server 110 starts a procedure for making a Web site available for general use, on which electronic albums are created and made open to the public. That procedure is performed after preparing the template (step S401) and preparing the category information (step S402). The template and the category information may be added and deleted, as required, after making the Web site available for general use.",
        "Subsequently, it is assumed that the creating user computer 130-1 accesses the Web site and notifies the intent of creating an electronic album to the album server 110. In such a case, in step S403, the album server 110 prompts selection of the category information. This prompt is performed by transmitting data for displaying the category information stored in the category DB 208 on the output device 307 of the creating user computer 130-1. Note that, in this specification, data displayed on the output device on the user side is expressed by \u201cdisplay data\u201d. Upon receiving the display data, the creating user computer 130-1 displays an image, such as shown in FIG. 11, on the display screen. As seen from FIG. 11, category items 1101 are displayed.",
        "Category selection information representing the selected category information and theme information input by the user are both transmitted to the album server 110. Those data are transmitted from the creating user computer 130-1 as a response to a prompt for selecting the category information and a prompt 1102 for inputting the theme information regarding the theme of an electronic album to be created. Upon receiving the category selection information and the theme information in step S404, the album server 110 goes to step S405.",
        "In step S405, the album server 110 transmits, to the creating user computer 130-1, display data for prompting the user to select one of the templates stored in the template DB 207. This step is responsive to the category selection information received in step S404. Also, the album server 110 prompts entry of the user information. This prompt is performed by transmitting, to the creating user computer 130-1, display data for displaying a screen image to input the user information (such as the user names, passwords, and e-mail addresses) regarding users (album creating users) who participate in creating the electronic album. Correspondingly, the creating user computer 130-1 displays an image, such as shown in FIG. 12, on the display screen. In FIG. 12, numeral 1201 denotes a list of templates to be selected, and numeral 1202 denotes a column in which the mail address is to be entered as the user information. Also, numeral 1203 denotes a column in which the mail addresses of friends, who participate in creating the electronic album, are to be entered.",
        "The column 1203 may be modified so as to request entry of the gender and ages of the album creating users as the user information. This is because the user information including the gender and ages represents personality of the album creating users. Such information may be available, for example, as marketing materials. In other words, such information may be useful in estimating what kinds of users having different personalities desire what categories of albums or travels.",
        "Template selection information representing the selected template and the user information input by the user are both transmitted from the creating user computer 130-1 to the album server 110. Those data are transmitted as a response to prompts for selecting the template and inputting the user information. In step S406, the album server 110 receives the template selection information and the user information.",
        "Then, in step S407, the album server 110 stores the category selection information and the theme information, received in step S404, in the category DB 208. Also, the album server 110 stores the template selection information and the user information, received in step S406, in the user information DB 209. At that time, the category selection information and the theme information, stored in the category DB 208, and the template selection information and the user information, stored in the user information DB 209, are stored as information regarding the first creating group 130 in a manner correlated to each other.",
        "In step S408, the album server 110 transmits approval-of-use information permitting the use of the Web site to create an electronic album by an e-mail, for example, to the creating users of the electronic album, whose addresses are stored in the user information DB 209 in above step S407. The approval-of-use information includes the user name, password, URL (Uniform Resource Locator), etc.",
        "More specifically, the approval-of-use information contains information needed for issuing (or obtaining) an approval of an access to the album server 110. The approval of an access to the album server 110 is given for each of a plurality of album creating user terminals. For example, when the approval-of-use information contains the user name, password and URL as mentioned above, different user names are defined for the individual album creating user terminals. Alternatively, different passwords may be defined for the individual album creating user terminals. The approval of an access is made individually for each of the plurality of album creating user terminals. Therefore, the album server 110 can discriminate the information (including the approval-of-use information) transmitted to it. Stated otherwise, the approval-of-use information enables the album server 110 to determine which one of the album creating user terminals has transmitted that approval-of-use information.",
        "In this embodiment, the password and the URL are of the same data. Thus, the URL has the function of the password. Also, the URL contains an \u201caddress\u201d on the Internet for accessing the selected template information. For example, when the category information is \u201ctravel\u201d and the sub-category information is \u201cMaldives\u201d, the URL contains an \u201caddress\u201d for the corresponding template. Further, the URL contains an \u201caddress\u201d for the electronic album under creation.",

        "First, the creating user computer 130-1 accesses the Web site provided by the album server 110 for creating an electronic album. Further, the creating user computer 130-1 notifies the intent of creating an electronic album to the album server 110 through the Web site (step S501).",
        "In response to the notification, the album server 110 transmits the display data for selection of the category information and the display data for entry of the theme information to the creating user computer 130-1. Then, in step S402, the creating user computer 130-1 receives the display data for selection of the category information and the display data for entry of the theme information. As a result, the image shown in FIG. 11 is displayed on the display screen.",
        "More specifically, in step S403, the creating user computer 130-1 displays, on the output device 307, a screen image based on the display data for selection of the category information and the display data for entry of the theme information. The screen image based on the display data for selection of the category information includes category selection buttons provided for each item of the category information for selecting the category information.",
        "Using the input device 306 of the creating user computer 130-1, the host user clicks one of the category selection buttons and selects the category information. Also, the host user enters the theme information using the input device 306 of the creating user computer 130-1. Then, the creating user computer 130-1 transmits both the category selection information representing the selected category information and the entered theme information to the album server 110.",
        "As a response to the transmitted category selection information, the creating user computer 130-1 receives in step S404, from the album server 110, the display data for selecting the template and the data for prompting entry of the user information regarding the creating users, i.e., the users of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3.",
        "Based on the data received in step S404, the creating user computer 130-1 displays in step S509 a template selection screen and an entry screen for inputting the user information regarding the album creating users on the output device, as shown in FIG. 12. The template selection screen may be displayed as an entry screen including a plurality of templates displayed at the same time on one display screen. Alternatively, one template may be displayed on one display screen by providing a switching button or the like on a screen image and replacing the template with a next one each time the switching button is depressed.",
        "The host user selects the template and enters the user information through the input device 306. Then, the creating user computer 130-1 transmits the template selection information representing the selected template and the entered user information to the album server 110. The user information contains the user names, passwords, e-mail addresses, etc. The user information may also contain the gender and ages of the creating users, as described above.",
        "As a response to the template selection information and the user information both transmitted in step S505, the creating user computer 130-1 receives, in step S406, approval-of-use information transmitted from the album server 110. The user information received by the album server 110 also contains the mail addresses of users who participate in creating the electronic album together with the host user. Based on the user information, therefore, the approval-of-use information is transmitted from the album server 110 to each of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3 and is received by them.",
        "The approval-of-use information contains, as described above, information enabling the album server 110 to determine which one of the album creating user terminals has transmitted the approval-of-use information. Hence, in an album creating process described below, the album server 110 can determine which one of the album creating user terminals has made an access to it.",

        "The album creating users, whose user information has been input in the initial setting process shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, access the Web site for creating the electronic album through the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3, and notify the intent of creating the electronic album. At that time, the album server 110 transmits, to one of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3 who has accessed, display data for prompting entry of the user name and the URL as password (step S601).",
        "In response to the prompt, the one user of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3 enters the user name and the URL as password by using the input device 306, followed by transmission.",
        "In step S602, the album server 110 receives the user name and the URL as password transmitted from the one of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3. Then, the album server 110 checks and confirms whether the received user name and URL match with those ones registered in the user information DB 209. If the received user name and URL match with the registered ones, the control flow proceeds to step S603, and if not so, the album creating process is ended.",
        "When the received user name and URL match with the registered ones and the control flow proceeds to step S603, the album server 110 checks whether any user of the first creating group 130, to which the user having the relevant user name belongs, is now creating the electronic album. If any user of the first creating group 130 is now creating the electronic album, the control flow proceeds to step S610.",
        "In step S610, the album server 110 determines whether the same user has accessed. In this embodiment, different approval-of-use information is assigned to each album creating user. Then, the album server 110 does not transmit the template for creating the electronic album when access has already been made based on the same approval-of-use information.",
        "More specifically, the URL serving also as a password contains the Internet address of the template selection information regarding the stored album. On the other hand, the user name is user information correlated to the URL (see step S407 in FIG. 4). Also, the user name is different for each user. Accordingly, when the album server 110 has already approved access based on the same name, it does not transmit the template for creating the electronic album to the user having the same name. In other words, when access to the album server is already permitted based on certain approval-of-use information, another access to the album server based on the same approval-of-use information is prohibited.",
        "The approval-of-use information for permitting access to the album server contains a user name and a password. In this embodiment, a different user name is defined for each of album creating users. Alternatively, different passwords may be defined for individual users. This case will make the user free from troublesome operation of inputting the user name.",
        "If it is determined in step S610 that the access is not from the same user, the control flow proceeds to step S604. In step S604, the album server 110 transmits the fact that another album creating user is under the operation, to the one of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3 that has accessed in step S601. Then, the album server 110 goes to step S605.",
        "On that occasion, the album server 110 transmits, to the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3, display data for a communication screen enabling the relevant users of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3 to make a chat or the like between or among them, and thereafter transmits communication information, which is input from any of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3, to all of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3.",

The template display data causes the whole of a template, including an image entry area and a text entry area, to be displayed on the output device 307 of the one of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3 so that the relevant user may create the electronic album. As another example, in response to a request from the relevant user of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3, the album server 110 may transmit the template display data for displaying only an image entry area or a text entry area.",
        "When the operation of creating an electronic album is performed for the first time by the first creating group 130, the display data for the template selected in the initial setting process, shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, is transmitted as the template display data. That is, the display data for the template, in which neither images nor comments are entered, is transmitted.",
        "When the operation of creating an electronic album has been performed before by the first creating group 130 and the user is going to edit the electronic album, the display data for the template, for which the operation of creating the electronic album has been performed before by the first creating group 130, is transmitted as the template display data. That is, the display data for the template, in which at least part of image data and comment data has already been entered, is transmitted.",
        "Subsequently, in step S606, the album server 110 receives the data transmitted from the one of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3. Then, the album server 110 goes to step S607. In step S607, the album server 110 determines whether the data received in step S606 is the data (e.g., image data and comment data) for creating the electronic album or an end-of-operation notice. If the received data is the data (e.g., image data and comment data) for creating the electronic album, the control flow proceeds to step S608, and if it is an end-of-operation notice, the album creating process is ended after storing the album data of the electronic album in the electronic album DB 210.",
        "When the received data is determined in step S607 as being the data for creating the electronic album and the control flow proceeds to step S608, the album server 110 processes the received creation data in match with the entry areas of the template and inputs it in the template. For example, when the received creation data is image data, the image data is input in the template after being scaled up or down in accordance with the size of the image entry area designated by the user.",
        "In step S609, the album server 110 transmits, to the user now creating the electronic album, display data for the template in which the creation data has been input in step S608. The control flow then returns to step S606. Thereafter, the album server 110 repeats the above-described steps S606 to S609.",

When the relevant user inputs the user name and the password using the input device 306, the one of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3 transmits the input user name and password to the album server 110.",
        "The album server 110 then determines whether the user name and the password transmitted from the one of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3 match with those ones registered in the user information DB 209. If matched, the template information is provided, and if not matched, the album creating process ends.",
        "As a response in the case where the transmitted user name and password match, the one of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3 receives in step S704 the display data for the template for creating an electronic album, which is provided from the album server 110, and displays a screen image based on the received template display data on the output device 307. In the screen image, the whole of a template is displayed such that the user easily recognizes the image entry area, the comment entry area, etc. Also, when any image data or comment data has already been input, the template is displayed with the image data or comment data input therein.",

Thereafter, the relevant users of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3 can progress the operation of creating the electronic album while communicating information with each other. For example, when the image data has already been input, they can transmit opinions about that image data between or among them. As a result of the chat, an image showing a view of the sea may be changed to an image showing a view of the mountain.",
        "On that occasion, the chat communications are stored in the external storage 204. Thus, communication data among a plurality of users is stored in the external storage 204 in correlation to the template. Also, as described above, when some user is going to participate in the chat, the user must access the album server based on the approval-of-use information. The approval-of-use information is different for each of the album creating users. When storing the chat communications in the external storage 204, therefore, it is possible to confirm what chat has been made among which members of the album creating users.",

        "FIG. 8 is a flowchart showing the operation of a process for inserting an advertisement in the electronic album. FIG. 8 represents the operation on the side of the album server 110.",
        "First, the album server 110 prepares processed album data by processing the album data of the electronic album which has been created and stored in the electronic album DB 210 (step S801). The processing of the album data is made by converting the album data into the more easily available form. Namely, the album data is converted into such data as allowing an advertisement providing company A to make a judgment whether the electronic album is suitable for insertion of an advertisement. Herein, when there are plural sets of album data belonging to one category, those data are collected for each category by the conversion. For example, assuming that the category information is \u201ctravel\u201d and the sub-category information is \u201cCanada\u201d, the album data including \u201cCanada\u201d in the theme information are correlated to each other. Such processing enables the company A to easily select the album in which an advertisement is to be inserted. Incidentally, the processed album data is prepared from the album data of the electronic album belonging to the category information that is going to be made open to the public on the Web site.",
        "Then, in step S802, the album server 110 transmits the processed album data to the advertisement providing computers 140, 141, etc. operated by users in companies who demand insertion of advertisements. It is here assumed, for example, that the processed album data is transmitted to the advertisement providing computer 140 of the company A.",
        "When the album server 110 receives in step S803 data from the advertisement providing computer 140 as a response to the transmission of the processed album data, it goes to step S804. In step S804, the album server 110 determines whether the data received in step S803 is advertisement album data, which is prepared by inputting an advertisement, to be inserted in the electronic album, in the processed album data transmitted to the advertisement providing computer 140, or a notice of indicating no demand for insertion of advertisements.",
        "If it is determined that the received data is the advertisement album data, the control flow proceeds to step S805. If it is determined that the received data is the notice of indicating no demand for insertion of advertisements, the control flow proceeds to step S806.",
        "In step S805, the album server 110 stores the received advertisement album data in the electronic album DB 210 and then goes to step S806.",
        "In step S806, the album server 110 determines whether solicitation for advertisements is to be continued. That determination is made based on, for example, whether there is the processed album data in which an advertisement is not yet inserted, and whether there is another user, e.g., a company, who demands insertion of an advertisement.",
        "If it is determined that the solicitation for advertisements is to be continued, the album server 110 returns to step S802 and repeats the above-described steps S802 to S806 for the advertisement providing computer 141 of the company B, for example. Note that, when continuing the solicitation for advertisements, the processed album data is transmitted to the advertisement providing computer 141 after removing, from it, the processed album data that has been used to prepare the advertisement album data stored in above step S805.",
        "If it is determined that the solicitation for advertisements is not to be continued, the album server 110 goes to step S807 and makes the advertisement album data, which has been stored in the electronic album DB 210, available for general use (S808). This step of making the advertisement album data available for general use is performed depending on the category information of the electronic album.",
        "Thereafter, general users operating the general user computers 150, 151, etc. are able to access the Web site, provided by the album server 110, through the general user computers 150, 151, etc., and to browse the images of the advertisement album data. In this connection, the album server 110 may arrange a contest, for example, and offer premiums to one or more creating users of the electronic albums, which gained prizes, from the advertising companies and so on. Stated otherwise, a step of selecting certain electronic album data for prizes may be added to increase an incentive to the creation of electronic albums. After making the advertisement album data open to the public, the advertisement inserting process ends.",
        "FIG. 9 is a flowchart showing the operation of a process for inserting an advertisement in the electronic album. FIG. 9 represents the operation on the side of the advertisement providing computers 140, 141, etc. Also, in the following description of FIG. 9, it is assumed that the advertisement providing computer 140 of the company A executes the operation of the advertisement inserting process ends.",
        "First, the advertisement providing computer 140 receives the processed album data transmitted from the album server 110 (step S901).",
        "Then, in step S902, the advertisement providing computer 140 displays, on the output device 307, images of the processed album data received in above step S901. The company A, i.e., the user of the advertisement providing computer 140, reviews the image displayed on the output device 307, and determines whether to demand insertion of an advertisement in any of the images of the processed album data. The company A then enters a determination result using the input device 306.",
        "If an advertisement is to be inserted, the control flow proceeds to step S903. On the other hand, if an advertisement is not to be inserted, the control flow proceeds to step S907. In the latter case, the company A, i.e., the user of the advertisement providing computer 140, notifies the intent of not demanding insertion of an advertisement to the album server 110, thereby ending the advertisement inserting process.",
        "In step S903, the advertisement providing computer 140 searches and selects the processed album data, for which an advertisement is to be inserted, in accordance with an instruction from the user, i.e., the company A. Then, in step S904, the advertisement providing computer 140 prepares advertisement data to be attached to the processed album data selected in above S903. The advertisement data to be attached to the processed album data may be prepared in advance.",
        "Then, in step S905, the advertisement providing computer 140 inputs the advertisement data, which has been prepared in above step S904, in the processed album data that has been selected in above step S903. As a result, the advertisement providing computer 140 prepares advertisement album data in a combination of the processed album data and the advertisement data.",
        "In step S906, the advertisement providing computer 140 transmits the prepared advertisement album data to the album server 110, thereby ending the advertisement inserting process.",
        "With this embodiment, as described above in detail, the album server 110 receives the user information regarding the album creating users transmitted from the creating user computer 130-1, and based on the received user information, it provides a template for creating an electronic album to the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3. Then, the album server 110 receives, via the network 120, creation data (such as image data and comment data) to be input in the template that has been transmitted from the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3, and inputs the received creation data in the template after processing it in accordance with respective entry areas of the template.",
        "Thus, the album creating users operating the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3 can transmit the creation data (such as image data and comment data), which is to be input in the template, through the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3 and the network 120. Accordingly, the album creating users can create a common electronic album in cooperation without meeting at a certain place for editing of the album.",
        "Also, the album server 110 stores category information for classifying electronic albums in the category DB 208, provides the category information to the creating user computer 130-1, and receives category selection information transmitted from the creating user computer 130-1 as a response to presentation of the category information. Then, in accordance with the received category selection information, the album server 110 provides the template to the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3. Therefore, the template suitable for the category information selected by the album creating user can be provided to the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3.",
        "Further, the album server 110 receives communication information transmitted from any of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3, and then transmits the received communication information to all of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3. This enables the album creating users operating the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3 to perform the operation of creating an electronic album while communicating with one another through a chat or the like.",
        "Since the communication information is stored in the album server 110, the album storing users can review the stored communication information later. In this respect, the communication information is stored in correlation to approval-of-use information specific to the individual users. It is therefore possible to know, for example, the process in which an image has been replaced, i.e., who has uttered the opinion to replace an image among the album creating users. That feature is effective in the case where there occurs a discrepancy between opinions of the users after the album has been completed or when it is closely completed, because of enabling the users to confirm the proceeding of the communications later.",
        "Moreover, upon receiving the creation data (such as image data and comment data), which is to be input in the template, from the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3, the album server 110 provides, to the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3, the template in which the received creation data has been input. Therefore, even when the creation data is transmitted from any one of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3, the updated latest template can be provided to all of the creating user computers 130-1 to 130-3.",
        "In this embodiment, a plurality of templates are prepared for each item of the category information and stored in the album server 110. Instead of preparing a plurality of templates for each item of the category information, however, a plurality of prepared templates may be shared by plural items of the category information.",
        "Alternatively, one template may be prepared for each item of the category information. In this case, when the host user selects the category information through the creating user computer, the template for creating an electronic album is automatically decided.",
        "While, in the advertisement inserting process of this embodiment shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, the processed album data prepared by processing the album data of the electronic album is transmitted to one of the advertisement providing computers at a time for solicitation of advertisements, the processed album data may be simultaneously transmitted to all of the advertisement providing computers. In such a case, if a plurality of advertisement providing computers demand insertion of advertisements for the same processed album data, the album server 110 may decide one user, who can insert an advertisement for that processed album data, in accordance with a predetermined rule such as deciding the advertising user in the order of higher advertisement charges proposed by bidding users.",
