        "The present application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/896,494, filed Jun. 29, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,870,016, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 119 of Provisional Application U.S. Ser. No. 60/215,597 filed Jun. 30, 2000, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
        "This invention relates to metallocene compounds and their use in the preparation of catalyst compositions for olefin polymerization, particularly propylene homo- and copolymerization. The present invention also relates to polymerisation processes using such catalyst compositions and polymer compositions obtainable by these processes.",
        "The use of metallocene compositions in olefin polymerization is well known. Metallocenes containing substituted, bridged indenyl derivatives are noted for their ability to produce isotactic propylene polymers having high isotacticity and narrow molecular weight distribution. Considerable effort has been made toward obtaining metallocene produced propylene polymers having ever-higher molecular weight and melting point and, thus, ever better strength (impact) properties, while maintaining suitable catalyst activity.",
        "Toward this end researchers have found that there is a direct relationship between the way in which a metallocene is substituted and the molecular structure of the resulting polymer. For the substituted, bridged indenyl type metallocenes, it is now well established that the type and arrangement of substituents on the indenyl groups, as well as the type of bridge connecting the indenyl groups, determines such polymer attributes as molecular weight and melting point.",
        "For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,840,644 and 5,770,753, incorporated herein by reference in their entireties, describe certain metallocenes containing aryl-substituted indenyl derivatives as ligands, which are said to provide propylene polymers having high isotacticity, narrow molecular weight distribution and very high molecular weight.",
        "Likewise, U.S. Pat. No. 5,936,053, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes certain metallocene compounds said to be useful for producing high molecular weight propylene polymers. These metallocenes have a specific hydrocarbon substituent at the 2 position and an unsubstituted aryl substituent at the 4 position on each indenyl group of the metallocene compound.",
        "WO 98/40419 and WO 99/42497 both describe certain supported catalyst systems for producing propylene polymers having high melting point. Metallocene compositions and their activators are often combined with a support material in order to obtain a catalyst system that is less likely to cause reactor fouling. However, it is known that supported metallocene catalyst systems tend to result in a polymer having lower melting point than would otherwise be obtained if the metallocene were not supported.",
        "Much of the current research in this area has been directed toward using metallocene catalyst systems under commercially relevant process conditions, to obtain propylene polymers having melting points higher than known metallocene catalyst systems and close to, or as high as, propylene polymers obtained using conventional, Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems. The present inventors have discovered metallocene compounds that not only have this capability, but retain it upon supportation.",
        "Additionally, it would be desirable to have available metallocenes which not only afford propylene homopolymers having high melting points of (i.e., high stereotacticity), but also elastomeric copolymers having the high molecular weights required for the production of, e.g., impact copolymers, thereby making possible the production of satisfactory in situ blends of, e.g., propylene homopolymer and ethylene-propylene rubbers (EPR's) with a single catalyst composition in a single reactor or in a series of two or more reactors. The present inventors have found metallocene compounds which in combination with a cocatalyst (activator) make both propylene homopolymers having high melting points and elastomeric copolymers that are suitable for the production of impact copolymers in combination with these propylene homopolymers.",
        "The present invention relates to novel metallocene compounds capable of providing propylene homo- and copolymers having high melting point and high molecular weight. The present invention further relates to metallocene catalyst compositions comprising one or more of these compounds and one or more activators or cocatalysts, and optionally, support material, and to the use of such catalyst compositions in polymerization, in particular propylene polymerization.",

They can form different stereoisomers and are preferably employed as chiral racemates. However, it is also possible to use the individual enantiomers in the (+) or (\u2212) form. The individual stereoisomers allow an optically active polymer to be prepared. In some cases it may be desirable to remove the meso form of the metallocenes, since the polymerization-active center (the metal atom) in these compounds is no longer chiral due to the mirror symmetry at the central metal atom and it is, therefore, not possible to produce a highly isotactic polymer. If the meso form is not removed, atactic polymer is formed in addition to isotactic polymer. For certain applications (e.g., if a random copolymer of propylene and ethylene and/or any other monoolefin and/or diene is to be made) this may be entirely desirable. Accordingly, racemic metallocenes contaminated with not more than about 5%, preferably not more than about 2%, and even more preferred not more than about 1%, of the meso form represent a particularly preferred embodiment of the metallocenes of the present invention. In another preferred embodiment, the meso form of a metallocene of the present invention is contaminated with not more than about 5%, preferably not more than about 2%, and even more preferred not more than about 1%, of the racemic form.",

        "Alkylalumoxanes such as methylalumoxane (MAO) are commonly used as metallocene activators. The alumoxanes which may be employed according to the present invention are not particularly limited. They include oligomeric linear and/or cyclic alkylalumoxanes of the general formula R\u2014(Al(R)\u2014O)n\u2014AlR2 for oligomeric, linear alumoxanes and (\u2014Al(R)\u2014O\u2014)m for oligomeric cyclic alumoxanes wherein n usually is 1-40, preferably 10-20, m usually is 3-40, preferably 3-20, and R usually is a C1-C8 alkyl group (e.g., methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl and isobutyl), and preferably methyl to provide methylalumoxane (MAO). MAO is a mixture of oligomers with a very wide distribution of molecular weights and usually with an average molecular weight of about 1200. MAO is typically kept in solution in toluene. It is also possible to use, for the present purpose, alumoxanes of the type just described wherein the alkyl groups in the above general formulae are different. A preferred example thereof is modified methylalumoxane (MMAO) wherein in comparison to MAO a part of the methyl groups is replaced by other alkyl groups. Alumoxane solutions, particularly methylalumoxane solutions, may be obtained from commercial vendors as solutions having various concentrations. There are a variety of methods for preparing alumoxane, non-limiting examples of which are described in U.S. Pat.

On the other hand said ratio is generally not higher than about 1,000:1, particularly not higher than about 500:1, with a ratio of not higher than about 300:1 being particularly preferred.",
        "Ionizing activators may also be used to activate metallocenes. These activators are neutral or ionic, or are compounds such as tri(n-butyl)ammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, which ionize the neutral metallocene compound. Unlike alumoxane cocatalysts, these ionizing activators can usually be employed in a molar ratio with respect to the metallocene which is much closer to 1:1 (e.g., less than 5:1, less than 2:1, and preferably about 1:1). Such ionizing compounds may contain an active proton, or some other cation associated with, but not coordinated or only loosely coordinated to, the remaining ion of the ionizing compound. Combinations of activators may also be used, for example, alumoxane and ionizing activator combination, see for example, WO 94/07928 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).",

These teach desirable methods of preparation wherein metallocenes are protonated by an anion precursor such that an alkyl/hydride group is abstracted from a transition metal to make it both cationic and charge-balanced by the non-coordinating anion. Suitable ionic salts include tetrakis-substituted borate or aluminum salts having fluorinated aryl-constituents such as phenyl, biphenyl and naphthyl.",
        "The term \u201cnoncoordinating anion\u201d (NCA) means an anion which either does not coordinate to said cation or which is only weakly coordinated to said cation thereby remaining sufficiently labile to be displaced by a neutral Lewis base. \u201cCompatible\u201d non-coordinating anions are those which are not degraded to neutrality when the initially formed complex decomposes. Further, the anion will not transfer an anionic substituent or fragment to the cation so as to cause it to form a neutral four coordinate metallocene compound and a neutral by-product from the anion. Non-coordinating anions useful in accordance with this invention are those which are compatible, stabilize the metallocene cation in the sense of balancing its ionic charge at +1, yet retain sufficient lability to permit displacement by an ethylenically or acetylenically unsaturated monomer during polymerization.",
        "The use of ionizing ionic compounds not containing an active proton but capable of producing both the active metallocene cation and a non-coordinating anion is also known. See, for example, EP-A-0 426 637 and EP-A-0 573 403 (each fully incorporated herein by reference). An additional method of making the ionic catalysts uses ionizing anion precursors which are initially neutral Lewis acids but form the cation and anion upon ionizing reaction with the metallocene compounds, for example the use of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane. See EP-A-0 520732 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Ionic catalysts for addition polymerization can also be prepared by oxidation of the metal centers of transition metal compounds by anion precursors containing metallic oxidizing groups along with the anion groups, see EP-A-0 495 375 (fully incorporated herein by reference).",

Alternatively, the metallocenes may be preactivated separately and then combined with the support material either separately or together. If the metallocenes are separately supported, then preferably, they are dried and then combined as a powder before use in polymerization.",

Preferably, the polymerization or copolymerization is carried out using olefins of the formula Ra\u2014CH\u2550CH\u2014Rb. In this formula, Ra and Rb are identical or different and are a hydrogen atom or an alkyl or alkenyl radical having 1 to 14 carbon atoms.

Examples of such olefins are ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene, vinylcyclohexane, norbornene and norbornadiene. In particular, propylene and ethylene are polymerized. The metallocenes and metallocenes catalyst systems of this invention are most suitable for the polymerization of propylene based polymers.",

This compound is added to the polymerization system in a concentration of from 100 to 0.01 mmol of Al per kg of reactor contents. Preference is given to triisobutylaluminum and triethylaluminum in a concentration of from 10 to 0.1 mmol of Al per kg of reactor contents.

Sci.: Part A Polymer Chemistry, Vol. 36, 1527-1542 (1998), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Hexane extractions are performed by weighing the polymer sample in a dried soxhlet thimble. Hexane is heated to reflux through the thimble in the soxhlet apparatus. When the extraction is complete the solvent is evaporated, and the sample dried under the appropriate vacuum. The amount of extractables is determined by weight. The thimble containing the insoluble polymer is dried in a vacuum oven and the weight of the recovered polymer is determined.",
