        "The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 11/030,213 entitled Fine Pitch Electrical Interconnect Assembly, filed Jan. 4, 2005 now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of PCT/US2004/022886 entitled Electrical Interconnect Assembly with Interlocking Contact System, filed Jul. 15, 2004, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent application Ser. No. 60/487,630, entitled Snap-in Retention Contact System, filed Jul. 16, 2003, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "The present invention is directed to an electrical interconnect assembly for electrically connecting a first circuit members to one or more second circuit members, and in particular, an electrical connector adapted to surface mount on a printed circuit board having elongated contact members with two or more beams adapted to electrically couple with integrated circuits and a pitch of about 1.1 millimeters or less.",
        "The current trend in connector design for those connectors utilized in the computer field is to provide both high density and high reliability connectors between various circuit devices. High reliability for such connections is essential due to potential system failure caused by improper connections of devices. Further, to assure effective repair, upgrade, testing and/or replacement of various components, such as connectors, cards, chips, boards, and modules, it is highly desirable that such connections be separable and reconnectable in the final product.",
        "Pin-type connectors soldered into plated through holes or vias are among the most commonly used in the industry today. Pins on the connector body are inserted through plated holes or vias on a printed circuit board and soldered in place using a conventional mechanism. Another connector or a packaged semiconductor device is then inserted and retained by the connector body by mechanical interference or friction. The tin lead alloy solder and associated chemicals used throughout the process of soldering these connectors to the printed circuit board have come under increased scrutiny due to their environmental impact. The plastic housings of these connectors undergo a significant amount of thermal activity during the soldering process, which stresses the component and threatens reliability.",
        "The soldered contacts on the connector body are typically the mechanical support for the device being interfaced by the connector and are subject to fatigue, stress deformation, solder bridging, and co-planarity errors, potentially causing premature failure or loss of continuity. In particular, as the mating connector or semiconductor device is inserted and removed from the connector attached to the printed circuit board, the elastic limit on the contacts soldered to the circuit board may be exceeded causing a loss of continuity. These connectors are typically not reliable for more than a few insertions and removals of devices. These devices also have a relatively long electrical length that can degrade system performance, especially for high frequency or low power components. The pitch or separation between adjacent device leads that can be produced using these connectors is also limited due to the risk of shorting.",
        "Another electrical interconnection method is known as wire bonding, which involves the mechanical or thermal compression of a soft metal wire, such as gold, from one circuit to another. Such bonding, however, does not lend itself readily to high-density connections because of possible wire breakage and accompanying mechanical difficulties in wire handling.",
        "An alternate electrical interconnection technique involves placement of solder balls or the like between respective circuit elements. The solder is reflowed to form the electrical interconnection. While this technique has proven successful in providing high-density interconnections for various structures, this technique does not allow facile separation and subsequent reconnection of the circuit members.",
        "An elastomer having a plurality of conductive paths has also been used as an interconnection device. The conductive elements embedded in the elastomeric sheet provide an electrical connection between two opposing terminals brought into contact with the elastomeric sheet. The elastomeric material that supports the conductive elements compresses during usage to allow some movement of the conductive elements. Such elastomeric connectors require a relatively high force per contact to achieve adequate electrical connection, exacerbating non-planarity between mating surfaces. Location of the conductive elements is generally not controllable. Elastomeric connectors may also exhibit a relatively high electrical resistance through the interconnection between the associated circuit elements. The interconnection with the circuit elements can be sensitive to dust, debris, oxidation, temperature fluctuations, vibration, and other environmental elements that may adversely affect the connection.",
        "The present invention is directed to an electrical interconnect assembly for electrically interconnecting terminals on a first circuit member with terminals on a second circuit member. The electrical interconnect assembly includes a housing with a plurality of through openings that extend between a first surface and a second surface of the housing. A plurality of contact members are positioned in a plurality of the through openings. The contact members include a base portion and one or more beams. At least one tab is attached to the base portion. The tab includes at least one engagement feature mechanically coupled to a solder member.",
        "In one embodiment, the one or more beams comprise a first beam having a proximal end attached to the base portion and a distal end extending away from the base portion in a first direction, and a second beam having a proximal end attached to the base portion and a distal end extending away from the base portion generally in the first direction. The first and second beams are configured to form at least one loop.",
        "The contact members preferably form one of a press-fit, an interlocking or a snap-fit relationship with the housing. In one embodiment, the housing includes a plurality of layers forming a plurality of substantially non-moldable through openings that extend between a first surface and a second surface. At least one contact member form an interlocking relationship with one of the substantially non-moldable through opening. The through openings are preferably arranged in a two-dimensional array. In one embodiment, at least one layer in the housing comprises a circuit layer.",
        "A sealing layer preferably substantially seals the through openings between the contact members and the housing along at least one of the first surface and the second surface. The sealing layer preferably comprises a curable polymeric material. In one embodiment, a polymeric layer is overmolded to secure the contact members to the housing.",

        "In one embodiment, the first and second beams comprise a serpentine shape forming two loops. The first beam is preferably attached to the base portion at a discrete location from the second beam. In one embodiment, the first and second beams overlap at a location between the respective proximal ends and distal ends to form a first loop. The distal ends of the first and second beams comprise a second loop. In one embodiment, the distal ends of the first and second beams form a loop when engaged with one of the first or second circuit members.",
        "The distal ends of the first and second beams optionally have overlapping tips. In one embodiment, the pair of overlapping tips prevents the distal ends from separating.",
        "In one embodiment, the at least one tab comprises a pair of opposing tabs. The solder member can optionally be compressively retained between a pair of opposing tabs. In another embodiment, the solder member is compressively engaged between the tab and the base portion. The engagement features can be a hole, a recess, a protrusion, a barb mechanically, or a variety of other structures that mechanically coupled to the solder member. The tabs and/or the engagement features can plastically and/or elastically deform into engagement with the solder member. The solder member can be spherical, cubic, hexagonal, or a variety of other shapes.",
        "The present invention is also directed to an electrical interconnect assembly for electrically interconnecting terminals on a first circuit member with terminals on a second circuit member in which the contact members have one or more beams each with a proximal end attached to the base portion and a distal end extending away from the base portion in a first direction. One or more tabs are attached to the base portion. The second circuit member includes a plurality of contact pads configured to engage with a plurality of the tabs on the contact members. A solder member is located on a plurality of the contact pads. When the solder member is melted, it forms a bond with the tabs on the contact members.

In the illustrated embodiment, the interconnect assembly 20 is electrically coupled to circuit member 40. As used",
        "The present invention is directed to a technique for creating an insulator housing in low, medium, or high volume by laminating layers of precisely patterned materials. The patterned layers can be constructed from the same or multiple material types. The layers are optionally selectively laminated to relieve stress caused by thermal expansion differentials.",
        "The present construction method permits internal features that would normally be impossible to mold or machine. For large pin count devices, the laminating process produces an inherently flat part without requiring molds. Stiffening layers made of materials such as BeCu, Cu, ceramic, or polymer filled ceramic can be added to provide additional strength and to provide thermal stability during solder reflow.",
        "The multi-layered housing can also include circuitry layers. Power, grounding and/or decoupling capacitance can be added between layers or between pins, and unique features such as embedded IC devices or RF antennae can optionally be incorporated.

The present interconnect assembly accommodates pin counts of 1000-2500 I/O range at 1.0 mm pitch, and more preferably a pitch of about 0.8 millimeter, and most preferably a pitch of about 0.5 millimeter. Such fine pitch interconnect assemblies are especially useful for communications, wireless, and memory devices. herein, the term \u201ccircuit members\u201d refers to, for example, a packaged integrated circuit device, an unpackaged integrated circuit device, a printed circuit board, a flexible circuit, a bare-die device, an organic or inorganic substrate, a rigid circuit, or any other device capable of carrying electrical current.",
        "The housing 24 may be constructed of a dielectric material, such as plastic. Suitable plastics include phenolics, polyesters, and Ryton\u00ae available from Phillips Petroleum Company. Alternatively, the housing 24 may be constructed from metal, such as aluminum, with a non-conductive surface, such as an anodized surface. For some applications, the metal housing may provide additional shielding of the contact members. In an alternate embodiment, the housing is grounded to the electrical system, thus providing a controlled impedance environment. Some of the contact members can be grounded by permitting them to contact an uncoated surface of the metal housing. As used herein, an \u201celectrically insulative connector housing\u201d or a \u201cmodule housing\u201d refers to a housing that is either non-conductive or substantially coated with a non-conductive material to prevent unwanted conductivity between the contact members and the housing, as discussed above.",

Multiple layers of differing contact members can be implemented to interact with each other, while being permanently engaged or separable. The layers can be structured in such a way as to rigidly retain the contact members or to allow the contacts to float or move along the X, Y, and/or Z axes of the contact members. The layers can be constructed in such a way that the base of the contact members are either in a sealed condition as a result of the insertion process to prevent solder or flux wicking during reflow, or the interface can be sealed post assembly.",

The top surface 60 is adapted to be biased toward the first circuit member 34 and the bottom surface 62 is adapted to be biased toward the second circuit member 40 (see e.g., FIG. 2). The first interface portion 30 of the contact member 28 is biased by elastomeric member 64 to protrude above the top surface 60 (position A) when the first circuit member 34 is not secured to the housing 24. The first interface portion 30 is displaced toward the top surface 62 (position B) when the first circuit member 34 is biased toward the housing 24. The location of the second interface portion 36 is biased against the second circuit member 40 when both the first and second circuit members 34, 40 are biased toward the housing 24.",
        "In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, the biasing of the first interface portion 30 is provided, at least in part, by a elastomeric member 64 located under the first interface portion 30. The elastomeric member 64 can be in any form suitable to provide the necessary biasing force, including spherical, cylindrical and rectangular. It can be secured in a variety of ways, including being glued to the housing 24 and/or the contact member 28, press-fitted into a cavity defined on either the housing of the contact member, or simply trapped in a space defined between the housing and the contact member. As the first circuit member 34 is biased toward the housing 24, the elastomeric member 64 is compressed, and the moment arm created by the forces at the tip portion 66 by the elastomeric member 64 and at the first interface portion 30 results in a force biasing the second interface portion 36 toward the second circuit member 40 secured to the bottom surface 62 of the housing 24.",
        "It should be noted that the designations of \u201ctop\u201d and \u201cbottom\u201d in this context is purely for the convenience of distinguishing different parts of the contact system and the environment in which it is used. These and other directional designations are not intended to restrict the scope of the invention to require the housing to be oriented in any particular direction.",
        "The present contact system 22 can also include features that provide stress relief to the contact member. For example, in one embodiment, best shown in FIG. 4, the second interface portion 36 has an arcuate bottom surface to allow the contact member 28 to roll when the first contact portion is pushed down by the first circuit member 34. The contact member 28 and the housing 24 can also be sufficiently compliant to provide stress relief.",

The contact members are preferably plated with a corrosion resistant metallic material such as nickel, gold, silver, palladium, or multiple layers thereof. In some embodiments the contact members are encapsulated except the interface portions. The encapsulating material is typically silicone based with a Shore A durometer of about 20 to about 40. Examples of suitable encapsulating materials include Sylgard\u00ae available from Dow Corning Silicone of Midland, Mich. and Master Sil 713 available from Master Bond Silicone of Hackensack, N.J.",
