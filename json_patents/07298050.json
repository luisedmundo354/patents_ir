        "The present application is based on Japanese Priority Patent Applications No. 2005-036514, filed on Feb. 14, 2005, and No. 2005-237777, filed on Aug. 18, 2005, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates generally to semiconductor devices, methods of manufacturing the same, capacitor structures, and methods of manufacturing the same, and more particularly to a semiconductor device having a semiconductor chip and an interposer including a capacitor and a through via, a method of manufacturing the same, a capacitor structure, and a method of manufacturing the same.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Electronic apparatuses are now becoming more sophisticated with more functions in the fields of personal computers, cellular phones, and other mobile equipment.",
        "In order to prevent malfunction due to switching noise in a large-scale integrated circuit (LSI) that operates at high frequencies, a method of reducing source impedance by connecting a decoupling capacitor absorbing noise in parallel with a power supply is employed.",
        "Source impedance Z is expressed by:\n\nZ(P)\u221dV/(nif),\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere V is supply voltage, n is the number of elements per LSI, i is the switching current of an element, and f is a driving frequency.",
        "Because of lower LSI voltage, high element integrity, and higher frequencies, there has been a sharp reduction in required impedance. The impedance Z(C) of a decoupling capacitor is given by:\n\nZ(C)=[R2+{2\u03c0fL\u2212(1/2\u03c0fC)}2]1/2,\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere R is resistance, L is inductance, and C is capacitance. In order to reduce the impedance of a decoupling capacitor, it is desired to increase capacitance C and reduce inductance L.",
        "Normally, a multilayer ceramic capacitor is disposed around an LSI as a decoupling capacitor. The multilayer ceramic capacitor has electrode layers and ceramic dielectric layers stacked alternately on each other, and has a pair of surface electrodes formed on corresponding side surfaces thereof so that each surface electrode is connected to every other corresponding electrode layer. A large capacitance can be provided, but it is not easy to reduce inductance because the electrode layers are connected to the surface electrodes on the side surfaces.",
        "As the operating frequencies of LSIs become higher, the decoupling capacitor is required to have lower inductance. However, it is difficult to meet this requirement with multilayer ceramic capacitors.",
        "Accordingly, in order to reduce the line length between the LSI and the decoupling capacitor, a method of providing decoupling capacitors 505 formed of thin film capacitors on the surface of an interposer 502 in which through vias 508 are formed in a Si substrate 503 as illustrated in FIG. 1 is proposed (for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2004-193614).",
        "This method is effective in high-performance LSIs. This is because the interposer 502 employs the Si substrate 503 formed of the same material as the LSI, so that there is no occurrence of problems resulting from stress due to a difference in thermal expansion. This is also because this method responds to an increase in LSI size, finer pitches, and a decrease in strength due to a low-k LSI interconnection insulating film.",
        "FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a conventional semiconductor device 500. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the semiconductor device 500 includes a semiconductor chip 501 that is operated at high frequencies and the interposer 502 to which the semiconductor chip 501 is connected.",
        "The interposer 502 includes the Si substrate 503, the decoupling capacitors 505, an insulating film 507, the through vias 508, and external connection terminals 509. The decoupling capacitors 505, each formed of a lower electrode, a dielectric film, and an upper electrode, are formed on the Si substrate 503. The decoupling capacitors 505 are connected to some of the through vias 508 connected to the power supply electrode pads of the semiconductor chip 501 and the other through vias 508 connected to the ground electrode pads of the semiconductor chip 501. The decoupling capacitors 505 cancel noise generated by the semiconductor chip 501 operating at high frequencies.",
        "Through holes 504 for forming the through vias 508 are formed in the Si substrate 503. The insulating film 507 is formed on the through holes 504. The insulating film 507 isolates the through vias 508 from the Si substrate 503. In general, a thermal oxide film is used for the insulating film 507.",
        "The through vias 508 are formed in the through holes 504. The external connection terminals 509 for connection to a circuit board are formed at the lower end part of the through vias 508 (for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2004-193614).",
        "In the case of manufacturing this semiconductor device 500, the decoupling capacitors 505 are formed on the Si substrate 503 after forming the through holes 504 and the through vias 508 in the Si substrate 503.",
        "For related art, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Nos. 2000-323845, 2004-71589, 2004-95638, 2003-197463, and 2004-273825 may also be referred to.",
        "However, the thickness of the Si substrate 503 of the conventional interposer 502 is greater than or equal to 0.5 mm. Accordingly, the aspect ratio of the through holes 504, that is, the thickness of the Si substrate 503/the diameter of the through holes 504, is high. In order to form these through holes 504, it is necessary to use ICP (Induction Coupling Plasma), which causes the problem of an increasing manufacturing cost of the semiconductor device 500. If the pitch of the external connection terminals 509 of the semiconductor chip 501 becomes narrower in the future, it becomes more difficult to form the through vias 504.",
        "Further, conventionally, the decoupling capacitors 505 formed of thin film capacitors are formed on the Si substrate 503 after forming the through holes 504. This causes a problem in that the decoupling capacitors 505 are likely to be poorly isolated, thus resulting in a reduced yield.",
        "Further, since there is a limit to the capacitance of a thin film capacitor with a single layer structure, it is desirable to increase capacitance by providing a thin film capacitor with a multilayer structure. However, this results in the problem of higher costs because electrodes and a dielectric film are formed and patterned for each layer. Further, since the thin film capacitor is formed on a patterned uneven underlayer, there is a problem in that a poor yield rate due to unevenness of the film thickness of a dielectric film and to dust causes an increase in costs.",
        "Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device in which the above-described disadvantages are eliminated.",
        "A more specific object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device operable at high frequencies and manufacturable at reduced cost.",
        "Another more specific object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device.",
        "Another more specific object of the present invention is to provide a capacitor structure employed in the semiconductor device, and a method of manufacturing the capacitor structure.",
        "One or more of the above objects of the present invention are achieved by a semiconductor device including: an interposer, the interposer including: a Si substrate; multiple through vias provided through an insulating material in corresponding through holes passing through the Si substrate; a thin film capacitor provided on a first main surface of the Si substrate so as to be electrically connected to the through vias; and a plurality of external connection terminals provided on a second main surface of the Si substrate so as to be electrically connected to the through vias, the second main surface facing away from the first main surface; and a semiconductor chip provided on one of the first main surface and the second main surface so as to be electrically connected to the through vias, wherein the Si substrate has a thickness less than a diameter of the through holes.",
        "According to one aspect of the present invention, the thickness of the Si substrate of an interposer is less than or equal to the diameter of a through hole. Accordingly, a semiconductor device that has a through hole of good accuracy and can support a further increase in density can be realized. Further, since a thin film capacitor is provided close to a semiconductor chip, a semiconductor device having equivalent series inductance reduced so as to enable the semiconductor chip to operate at high frequencies can be realized. Furthermore, since it is easy to form the through hole, an inexpensive semiconductor device manufacturable at reduced cost can be realized.",

        "According to one aspect of the present invention, by performing the step of thinning down a Si substrate, the aspect ratio of a through hole (Si substrate thickness/through hole diameter) can be reduced, so that the through hole can be formed easily in the Si substrate. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the cost of manufacturing a semiconductor device. Further, since the step of forming a thin film capacitor is performed before the step of forming the through hole, it is possible to form the dielectric film of the thin film capacitor at high temperature. Accordingly, it is possible to form a thin film capacitor having a high dielectric constant, large capacitance, and high reliability.",

        "According to one aspect of the present invention, the thickness of the Si substrate of a capacitor structure is less than or equal to the diameter of through holes. Accordingly, it is possible to realize a semiconductor device that has the capacitor structure including the through holes of good accuracy and can support a further increase in the density of a circuit board. Further, since a thin film capacitor is provided close to a semiconductor chip, it is possible to realize a semiconductor device having reduced equivalent series inductance so as to enable the semiconductor chip to operate at high frequencies.",

        "According to one aspect of the present invention, by performing the process of thinning down a Si substrate, it is possible to reduce the aspect ratio (Si substrate thickness/through hole diameter) of through holes, thus making it easy to form the through holes in the Si substrate. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the manufacturing costs of a semiconductor device. Further, a thin film capacitor is formed before formation of the through holes. Accordingly, it is possible to form a dielectric film of the thin film capacitor at high temperature, so that the thin film capacitor having a high dielectric constant, large capacitance, and high reliability can be realized.",
        "One or more of the above objects of the present invention are also achieved by a capacitor structure including: a substrate; a thin film capacitor including at least three electrode layers and a dielectric film provided between each adjacent two of the at least three electrode layers, the at least three electrode layers and the dielectric films being stacked on the substrate; and a pair of first and second pad electrodes spaced apart from each other at a predetermined interval, the first and second pad electrodes serving as external connection terminals of the thin film capacitor, wherein the first pad electrode is electrically connected to odd-numbered ones of the at least three electrode layers from a side of the substrate; the second pad electrode is electrically connected to one or more even-numbered ones of the at least three electrode layers from the side of the substrate; and stacked capacitors having substantially a same capacitance are connected in parallel between the first pad electrode and the second pad electrode.",

        "FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of an electronic device 10 according to a first embodiment of the present invention.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2, the electronic device according to this embodiment includes a semiconductor device 11 and a circuit board 12 on which the semiconductor device 11 is mounted. Multiple external connection terminals 44 of the semiconductor device 11 are electrically connected to corresponding connection pads 13 provided on the circuit board 12.",
        "The semiconductor device 11 includes a semiconductor chip 20 and an interposer 30. The semiconductor chip 20 includes at least one connection pad 32A and at least one connection pad 32B. The connection pad 32A, which is an electrode pad for power supply (a power supply electrode pad), is connected to a corresponding internal connection terminal 56A provided on the first main surface side of the interposer 30. The connection pad 32B, which is an electrode pad for ground (a ground electrode pad), is connected to a corresponding internal connection terminal 56B provided on the first main surface side of the interposer 30. For example, a semiconductor chip that is driven at high frequencies may be used as the semiconductor chip 20 employed in this embodiment. This semiconductor chip 20 has semiconductor circuits such as a CPU, a ROM, and a RAM formed on a Si substrate.",

        "The Si substrate 36 is a thinned plate. Through holes 38 of a diameter R1 are formed in the Si substrate 36 at positions corresponding to the positions of formation of the through vias 43A and 43B. The through holes 38 are formed so that their diameter R1 is greater than the diameter of the through vias 43A and 43B.",
        "Thus, forming the through holes 38 so that their diameter R1 is greater than the diameter of the through vias 43A and 43B makes it possible to form a layer of the insulating material 39 easily between the Si substrate 36 and the through vias 43A and 43B.",
        "Further, the thickness M1 of the thin Si substrate 36 is less than the diameter R1 of the through holes 38. Thus, forming the through holes 38 having the diameter R1 greater than that of the through vias 43A and 43B in the thin Si substrate 36 makes it possible to form good through holes 38 with a reduced aspect ratio.",
        "The diameter R1 of the through holes 38 may be, for example, 100 \u03bcm. The pitch in forming the through holes 38 may be, for example, 150 \u03bcm to 250 \u03bcm. The diameter R1 and the pitch of the through holes 38 are not limited to the above-described numerical values.",
        "Further, preferably, the thickness M1 of the Si substrate 36 is within the range of 30 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm. The Si substrate 36 has insufficient strength with the thickness M1 being less than 30 \u03bcm. If the thickness M1 is greater than 100 \u03bcm, the aspect ratio (M1/R1) of the through holes 38 becomes high, so that it is difficult to form the through holes 38.",

Through holes 40A and 40B are formed in the insulating material 39 at positions corresponding to the through holes 38. The through hole 40A passes through the insulating material 39 and the insulating film 45.

The metal film 41 is electrically connected to the metal film 55 formed on the first main surface side of the interposer 30. In forming the through vias 43A and 43B and the external connection terminals 44 by electroplating, the metal film 41 serves as a power supply layer. A multilayer film formed by stacking, for example, a Ti film, a Cu film, and a Ni film in this order may be employed as the metal film 41.",

The upper electrode 49 is electrically connected to the internal connection terminal 56A. The lower electrode 47 is electrically connected to the internal connection terminal 56B.

        "In the case of using a metal oxide material having a perovskite crystal structure as the dielectric film 48, it is preferable to employ Pt as the material of the lower electrode 47. Employment of Pt enables the dielectric film 48 to grow epitaxially, so that the dielectric constant of the dielectric film 48 increases.",
        "As the material of the upper electrode 49, Au, Al, Pt, Ag, Pd, Cu, and their alloys are employable, for example. The above-described metals or their alloys may be stacked on IrOx. The upper electrode 49 may be, for example, 100 nm in thickness.",

Employment of such a material makes it possible to prevent degradation of the dielectric film 48 having a perovskite crystal structure.",
        "The insulating film 52, which is, for example, 2 \u03bcm in thickness, is provided so as to cover the protection film 51. An opening part (hole) 53A exposing the insulating film 45, an opening part (hole) 53B exposing the lower electrode 47, and opening parts (holes) 54 positioned close to the opening part 53A and exposing the upper electrode 49 are formed in the insulating film 52.

A multilayer film formed by stacking, for example, a Ti film, a Cu film, and a Ni film in this order may be employed as the metal film 55.",
        "The internal connection terminal 56A is formed on the metal film 55 so as to fill the opening parts 53A and 54 and project from the insulating film 52.

        "According to this embodiment, the thickness M1 of the Si substrate 36 of the interposer 30 may be less than or equal to the diameter R1 of the through holes 38. Accordingly, the semiconductor device 11, having the through holes 38 of good accuracy and the interposer 30 that can support a further increase in density, is realized.",
        "Further, since the thin film capacitor 46 is provided close to the semiconductor chip 20, equivalent series inductance is reduced. As a result, the semiconductor device 11, in which the semiconductor chip 20 is operable at high frequencies, is realized.",

Alternatively, a multilayer thin film capacitor having at least two dielectric films 48 between the lower electrode 47 and the upper electrode 49 and an intermediate electrode sandwiched between the adjacent dielectric electrodes 48 may be provided in place of the single-layer thin film capacitor 46.

A description is given below, with reference to the drawings, of a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device 11 according to this embodiment.",
        "First, in the process of FIG. 3A, by sputtering, the insulating film 45 serving as an adhesion film is formed, and further, a lower electrode film 47A, a dielectric film 48A, and an upper electrode film 49A are successively formed on a surface of the Si substrate 36 having a thermal oxide film (a SiO2 film) formed on the surface.",
        "Specifically, for example, using a multi-target DC-RF magnetron sputtering device, an amorphous alumina film (50 nm in thickness) is formed as the insulating film 45 on the Si substrate 36 on which a thermal oxide film (a SiO2 film) is formed with the substrate temperature being 200\u00b0 C. Next, with the substrate temperature being 200\u00b0 C., a Pt film (100 nm in thickness) is formed as the lower electrode film 47A. Next, with the substrate temperature being 600\u00b0 C., a BST film (100 nm in thickness) is formed as the dielectric film 48A. Next, with the substrate temperature being 25\u00b0 C., an IrOx film and a Au film (100 nm in thickness) are successively formed as the upper electrode film 49A. These multilayer films 45, 47A, 48A, and 49A may be formed by a method other than sputtering, such as vapor deposition or CVD.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 3B, the stacked upper electrode film 49A, dielectric film 48A, and lower electrode film 47A are patterned by ion milling, so that the thin film capacitor 46 is formed. Next, the thin film capacitor 46 is subjected to heat treatment in an oxygen atmosphere so as to remove thermal distortion and supply oxygen atoms to oxygen deficient parts in the dielectric film 48 and the IrOx film. The lower electrode 47, the dielectric film 48, and the upper electrode 49 of the thin film capacitor 46 are formed by patterning the lower electrode film 47A, the dielectric film 48A, and the upper electrode film 49A, respectively.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 3C, the protection film 51 covering the thin film capacitor 46 and the insulating film 45 is formed. Next, an opening part (hole) 51A exposing the upper electrode 49 is formed in the protection film 51 by ion milling. Next, the protection film 51 is subjected to post-annealing in an oxygen atmosphere. Specifically, for example, an amorphous alumina film (0.1 \u03bcm in thickness) is formed as the protection film 51 by sputtering using an RF magnetron sputtering device. The protection film 51 may be formed by a method other than sputtering, such as vapor deposition or CVD.",
        "Thus, forming the thin film capacitor 46 before a through hole formation process makes it possible to form the dielectric film 48 at high temperature, so that the thin film capacitor 46 having large capacitance, high reliability, and a high dielectric constant can be formed. Further, the thin film capacitor 46 is formed by stacking the lower electrode film 47A, the dielectric film 48A, and the upper electrode film 49A successively on the even planar insulating film 45, and patterning the lower electrode film 47A, the dielectric film 48A, and the upper electrode film 49A. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the yield of the thin film capacitor 46. Further, foreign materials generated in forming the through holes 38, 40A, and 40B and the through vias 43A and 43B are prevented from adhering to the area of formation of the thin film capacitor 46. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the yield of the thin film capacitor 46.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 3D, the insulating film 52 is formed so as to cover the structure illustrated in FIG. 3C. Next, the opening part 53A exposing the insulating film 45, the opening part 53B exposing the lower electrode 47, and the opening parts 54 exposing the upper electrode 49 are formed. Specifically, for example, a photosensitive polyimide resin (2 \u03bcm in thickness) is formed as the insulating film 52 by spin coating. The opening parts 53A, 53B, and 54 are formed by exposing the photosensitive polyimide resin to light and developing the photosensitive polyimide resin. The insulating film 52 may also be formed by a method other than spin coating, such as spraying or dipping.",
        "Next in the process of FIG. 3E, the metal film 55 serving as a plating seed layer is formed on the structure illustrated in FIG. 3D. Specifically, for example, a Ti film, a Cu film, and a Ni film are successively formed by sputtering so as to serve as the metal film 55. The metal film 55 may be formed by a method-other than sputtering, such as vapor deposition or CVD.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 3F, a resist layer 66 exposing part of the metal film 55 corresponding to the area of formation of the internal connection terminals 56A and 56B is formed on the metal film 55. Next, the opening parts 53A, 53B, and 54 are filled with a conductive material 68. The conductive material 68 is later reflowed so as to serve as the internal connection terminals 56A and 56B. Specifically, the conductive material 68 is formed by causing Sn\u2014Ag solder to be deposited by electroplating with the metal film 55 serving as a power supply layer.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 3G, an unnecessary part of the metal film 55 not covered with the conductive material 68 is removed. Thereafter, the conductive material 68 is reflowed by heating, so that the internal connection terminals 56A and 56B of Sn\u2014Ag solder bumps are formed.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 3H, a holding substrate 70 is adhered through an adhesive tape 69 to the structure illustrated in FIG. 3G on its first main surface side (the side on which the internal connection terminals 56A and 56B are formed), and the Si substrate 36 is thinned from the second main surface side. Specifically, for example, the Si substrate 36 is thinned down to 50 \u03bcm in thickness with a grinder. After thinning down the Si substrate 36, the adhesive tape 69 is removed. For example, a UV tape, whose adhesiveness is reduced by ultraviolet ray irradiation, may be employed as the adhesive tape 69. For example, grinding or etching may be employed to thin down the Si substrate 36. As grinding methods, polishing such as buffing and CMP and cutting are employable, for example. As etching methods, wet etching and plasma etching are employable, for example.",
        "Thus, thinning down the Si substrate 36 before forming the through holes 38 makes it possible to reduce the aspect ratio of the through holes 38 and form the through holes 38 using plasma etching or wet etching lower in cost than ICP (Induction Coupling Plasma). Accordingly, it is possible to manufacture the semiconductor device 11 at lower cost.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 3I, the through holes 38 of the diameter R1 are formed in the Si substrate 36 from its second main surface side. Specifically, for example, the through holes 38 may be formed by wet etching using a liquid mixture of hydrogen fluoride and a nitric acid as etching liquid. Wet etching using other etching liquids or plasma etching may also be employed. The diameter R1 of the through holes 38 may be, for example, 100 \u03bcm.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 3J, the insulating material 39 is applied to fill in the through holes 38 and to cover the lower surface 36B of the Si substrate 36, and next, the insulating material 39 is hardened. Specifically, for example, an epoxy resin, which is a heat-resistant resin, is applied as the insulating material 39 by spin coating, and thereafter, the epoxy resin is thermoset at a temperature of 200\u00b0 C. The insulating material 39 may also be applied by a method other than spin coating, such as spraying or dipping.",
        "Thus, forming the insulating material 39 so that the insulating material 39 simultaneously covers the lower surface 36B of the Si substrate 36 and fills in the through holes 38 makes it possible to simplify the manufacturing process of the semiconductor device 11 compared with the case of forming an insulating material provided on the lower surface 36B of the Si substrate 36 and an insulating material filling in the through holes 38 separately.",
        "Employment of a resin material such as a low-k resin, a heat-resistant resin, or a photosensitive resin as the insulating material 39 filling in the through holes 38 makes it possible to form the through holes 40A and 40B for forming the through vias 43A and 43B with ease, so that it is possible to manufacture the semiconductor device 11 at reduced cost. An insulating material on the lower surface 36B of the Si substrate 36 and an insulating material filling in the through holes 38 may be provided separately. In this case, the insulating material provided on the lower surface 36B of the Si substrate 36 may be different from the insulating material filling in the through holes 38.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 3K, the through holes 40A and 40B of 70 \u03bcm in diameter exposing the metal film 55 are formed in the insulating material 39 filling in the through holes 38. Specifically, the through holes 40A and 40B are formed by ArF excimer laser processing using a heat-resistant resin or a low-k resin as the insulating material 39. The through holes 40A and 40B may also be formed using a laser processing method other than ArF excimer laser processing, or plasma etching. In the case of using a photosensitive resin as the insulating material 39, the through holes 40A and 40B may be formed by exposing and developing part of the insulating material 39 corresponding to the through holes 40A and 40B.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 3L, the metal film 41, the through vias 43A and 43B, and the external connection terminals 44 are formed by the same method as illustrated in the processes of FIGS. 3E through 3G. At this point, the through vias 43A and 43B and the external connection terminals 44 are formed simultaneously.",
        "Thus, forming the through vias 43A and 43B and the external connection terminals 44 simultaneously makes it possible to simplify the manufacturing process of the semiconductor device 11 and reduce its manufacturing cost. Further, forming the through vias 43A and 43B after thinning down the Si substrate 36 reduces the length of the through vias 43A and 43B connecting the semiconductor chip 20 and the circuit board 12. This makes it possible to transmit a high-frequency signal at high speed between the semiconductor chip 20 and the circuit board 12 (FIG. 2) connected to the external connection terminals 44. Further, the through holes 40A and 40B are formed in the thinned Si substrate 36. This reduces time for processing the through vias 43A and 43B, so that it is possible to reduce manufacturing costs.",
        "Next, the Si substrate 36 is cut using, for example, a dicer, so that the interposer 30 is formed. Thereafter, the connection pads 32A and 32B of the semiconductor chip 20 are connected to the internal connection terminals 56A and 56B, respectively, of the interposer 30, so that the semiconductor device 11 is manufactured.",
        "According to the manufacturing method according to this embodiment, since the Si substrate 36 is thinned down, the amount of processing in the direction of thickness is reduced in forming the through holes 38. Accordingly, the through holes 38 can be formed with ease, and the processing time can be reduced. Further, it is possible to form the through holes 38 by wet etching or plasma etching. Accordingly, it is possible to form the through holes 38 at far lower cost than by conventional ICP. Further, the through holes 40A and 40B for the through vias 43A and 43B are formed by laser via processing with the through holes 38 being filled with an insulating material such as a low-k resin, a heat-resistant resin, or a photosensitive resin, thus resulting in low processing cost.

These multilayer films 45, 47A, 48A, and 49A may be formed by a method other than sputtering, such as vapor deposition or CVD.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 11B, the stacked upper electrode film 49A, dielectric film 48A, and lower electrode film 47A are patterned together by ion milling, so that the thin film capacitors 46 each of the lower electrode 47, the dielectric film 48, and the upper electrode 49 are formed. Next, the thin film capacitors 46 are subjected to heat treatment in an oxygen atmosphere so as to remove thermal distortion and supply oxygen atoms to oxygen deficient parts in the dielectric film 48 and the IrOx film. The lower electrode 47, the dielectric film 48, and the upper electrode 49 of each thin film capacitor 46 are formed by patterning the lower electrode film 47A, the dielectric film 48A, and the upper electrode film 49A, respectively.",
        "Thus, forming the thin film capacitors 46 before forming the through holes 124 in the Si substrate 36 makes it possible to form the dielectric film 48 at temperatures as high as 300\u00b0 C to 1000\u00b0 C., so that the thin film capacitors 46 having a high dielectric constant, large capacitance, and high reliability can be formed.",
        "Further, each thin film capacitor 46 is formed by stacking the lower electrode film 47A, the dielectric film 48A, and the upper electrode film 49A successively on the even planar insulating film 45, and thereafter, patterning the lower electrode film 47A, the dielectric film 48A, and the upper electrode film 49A. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the yield of the thin film capacitors 46.",
        "Further, dust and foreign materials generated in forming opening parts (holes) 145 (FIG. 11E), the through holes 124 and 143, and the through vias 133A through 133C are prevented from adhering to part of the insulating film 45 corresponding to the area of formation of the thin film capacitors 46. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the yield of the thin film capacitors 46.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 11C, the protection film 125 is formed so as to cover the thin film capacitors 46 and the insulating film 45. At this point, opening parts (holes) 125A exposing the corresponding lower electrodes 47, opening parts (holes) 125B exposing the corresponding upper electrodes 49, and opening parts (holes) 125C exposing the insulating film 45 are formed in the protection film 125. Specifically, for example, a photosensitive polyimide resin (2 \u03bcm in thickness) is applied as the protection film 125 by spin coating. The opening parts 125A through 125C are formed by exposing the photosensitive polyimide resin to light and developing the photosensitive polyimide resin. The insulating film 125 may also be formed by a method other than spin coating, such as spraying or dipping.",
        "A Si3N4 film, a SiO2 film, or an alumina film may be used as the protection film 125. In this case, for example, the protection film 125 is formed using an RF magnetron sputtering device, and then, the opening parts 125A through 125C are formed by ion milling. Then, the protection film 125 is subjected to post-annealing in an oxygen atmosphere. In this case, the protection film 125 may be formed by a method other than sputtering, such as vapor deposition or CVD.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 11D, the vertical interconnection lines 126 in the corresponding opening parts 125A, the vertical interconnection lines 127 in the corresponding opening parts 125B, and the pad electrodes 128 and 129 are simultaneously formed. Specifically, for example, a Ti film and a Cu film are successively formed on the structure shown in FIG. 11C as a plating seed layer by sputtering. Thereafter, a resist layer is formed on the plating seed layer so as to have opening parts (holes) exposing an area in which the pad electrodes 128 and 129 are formed, and a plating film is deposited on the plating seed layer by electroplating. After the formation of the vertical interconnection lines 126 and 127 and the pad electrodes 128 and 129, the resist layer is removed. Next, an unnecessary part of the plating seed layer on which the plating film is not formed is removed. For example, a Cu plating film may be employed as the plating film. The plating seed layer may be formed by a method other than sputtering, such as vapor deposition or CVD.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 11E, part of the insulating film 45 exposed from the opening parts 125C and part of the Si substrate 36 corresponding to the opening parts 125C are etched from the first main surface side of the Si substrate 36 so that the opening parts 145 of the diameter R2 are formed in the Si substrate 36. The opening parts 145 have substantially the same depth (vertical dimension) as the through holes 124, and become the through holes 124 when the thickness of the Si substrate 36 is reduced. For example, wet etching and plasma etching may be employed as etching methods. A liquid mixture of hydrogen fluoride and nitric acid may be employed as etching liquid used for wet etching.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 11F, the holding substrate 70 is adhered through the adhesive tape 69 to the structure illustrated in FIG. 11E on its first main surface side, and the Si substrate 36 is thinned from the second main surface side. As a result, the opening parts 145 are exposed on the second main surface of the Si substrate 36 so that the through holes 124 are formed. Thereby, the capacitor structure 123 having the thin film capacitors 46 on the Si substrate 36 is manufactured.",
        "Specifically, for example, the Si substrate 36 is thinned down to 50 \u03bcm in thickness with a grinder. After thinning down the Si substrate 36, the adhesive tape 69 is removed. For example, a UV tape, whose adhesiveness is reduced by ultraviolet ray irradiation, may be employed as the adhesive tape 69. For example, grinding or etching may be employed to thin down the Si substrate 36. As grinding methods, polishing such as buffing and CMP and cutting are employable, for example. As etching methods, wet etching and plasma etching are employable, for example.",
        "Thus, by forming the through holes 124 by thinning down the Si substrate 36 until the opening parts 145 are exposed after forming the opening parts 145 having substantially the same depth as the through holes 124 from the first main surface side of the Si substrate 36, the aspect ration (M1/R2) can be reduced. This makes it possible to form the through holes 124 in the Si substrate 36 with ease, thus making it possible to reduce the manufacturing costs of the semiconductor device 120.",
        "Further, by forming the opening parts 145 by plasma etching or wet etching at a lower cost than ICP, it is possible to reduce the manufacturing costs of the semiconductor device 120.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 11G, the capacitor structure 123 is adhered to the multilayer interconnection structure 122 so that the through holes 124 expose the pads 142. The capacitor structure 123 is adhered to the multilayer interconnection structure 122 with, for example, an epoxy-based adhesive agent.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 11H, the insulating film 132 is formed so as to cover the capacitor structure 123 and to fill in the through holes 124. Then, the insulating film 132 is hardened. Specifically, for example, an epoxy resin, which is a heat-resistant resin, is applied as the insulating film 132 by spin coating, and thereafter, the epoxy resin is thermoset at a temperature of 200\u00b0 C. The insulating film 132 may also be applied by a method other than spin coating, such as spraying or dipping. Further, a film-like resin layer may also be used as the insulating film 132. The same material as that of the insulating material 39 described in the first embodiment may be employed as the material of the insulating film 132.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 11I, an opening part (hole) 132A exposing the pad electrode 128, an opening part (hole) 132B exposing the pad electrode 129, and the through holes 143 exposing the pads 142 are formed in the insulating film 132. Specifically, the opening parts 132A and 132B and the through holes 143 are formed by ArF excimer laser processing using a heat-resistant resin or a low-k resin as the insulating film 132. The opening parts 132A and 132B and the through holes 143 may also be formed using a laser processing method other than ArF excimer laser processing, or plasma etching. In the case of using a photosensitive resin as the insulating film 132, the opening parts 132A and 132B and the through holes 143 may be formed by exposing and developing part of the insulating film 132 corresponding to the opening parts 132A and 132B and the through holes 143.",
        "Thus, the manufacturing costs are reduced by filling the through holes 124 with an insulating material such as a low-k resin, a heat-resistant resin, or a photosensitive resin, and forming the through holes 143 for the through vias 133A through 133C by laser via processing.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 11J, by the same method as in the above-described process of FIG. 11D, the through vias 133A through 133C and the internal connection terminals 136A through 136C are simultaneously formed. As a result, the circuit board 121 having the capacitor structure 123 is manufactured.",
        "Thus, by forming the through vias 133A through 133C and the internal connection terminals 136A through 136C simultaneously, it is possible to simplify the manufacturing process and reduce the manufacturing costs of the semiconductor device 120. Further, forming the through vias 133A through 133C after thinning down the Si substrate 36 reduces the depth (vertical dimension) of the through vias 133A through 133C. Therefore, it is possible to transmit a high-frequency signal at high speed between the semiconductor chip 20 connected to the internal connection terminals 136A through 136C and another circuit board (not graphically illustrated) connected to the external connection terminals 144.",
        "Further, by reducing the aspect ratio (M1/R2) of the through holes 124, it is possible to reduce time for formation of the through vias 133A through 133C and thus improve productivity.",
        "Thereafter, the internal connection terminals 136A through 136C of the circuit board 121 are connected to the connection pads 32A through 32C, respectively, of the semiconductor chip 20. Thereby, the semiconductor device 120 is manufactured.",
        "According to the semiconductor device manufacturing method of this embodiment, the opening parts 145 having substantially the same depth as the through holes 124 are formed in the Si substrate 36 on the side on which the thin film capacitors 46 are formed, and thereafter, the through holes 124 are formed by reducing the thickness of the Si substrate 36 until the opening parts 145 (FIG. 11E) are exposed. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the aspect ratio of the through holes 124. This makes it possible to form the through holes 124 in the Si substrate 36 with ease, thus making it possible to reduce the manufacturing costs of the semiconductor device 120.",
        "Further, since the thin film capacitors 46 are formed before forming opening parts, it is possible to form the dielectric film 48 of each thin film capacitor 46 at high temperature, thus making it possible to form the thin film capacitors 46 having a high dielectric constant, large capacitance, and high reliability.",
        "Further, dust and foreign materials generated in forming the through holes 124 are prevented from adhering to the thin film capacitors 46. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the yield of the thin film capacitors 46.",
        "FIGS. 12A and 12B are diagrams showing another method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the fourth embodiment.",
        "In the above-described semiconductor device manufacturing method according to this embodiment, the opening parts 145 are formed in the Si substrate 36 before the Si substrate 36 is thinned down, and thereafter, the Si substrate 36 is thinned down until the opening parts 145 are exposed, thereby forming the through holes 124. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 12A, the holding substrate 70 may be adhered through the adhesive tape 69 to the Si substrate 36 of the structure shown in FIG. 11D on the upper surface 36A side of the Si substrate 36, and the Si substrate 36 may be thinned down from its lower surface 36B side (a substrate thinning process). Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 12B, the through holes 124 may be formed in the Si substrate 36 (a through hole formation process). The through holes 124 may be formed from either the upper surface 36A side or the lower surface 36B side of the Si substrate 36.",
        "The electric characteristics and the reliability of a circuit board including a capacitor structure made by the above-described manufacturing process of FIGS. 11A through 11J were evaluated. The circuit board was made using the conditions specified in the manufacturing process of FIGS. 11A through 11J. With respect to the electric characteristics, the results were a capacitance density of 4 \u03bcF/cm2, an ESR (equivalent series resistance) of 0.01 \u03a9, an ESL (equivalent series inductance) of 10 pH, and a withstand voltage of 20 V or over. These results confirmed that it is possible to form a circuit board having a capacitor structure with large capacitance and reduced ESL.",
        "A high temperature and humidity load test was conducted as a reliability evaluation under the conditions of a temperature of 121\u00b0 C., a relative humidity of 85%, an applied voltage of 3 V, and a test time of 48 hours. The insulation resistance after the test was higher than or equal to 10 M\u03a9, which confirmed that the circuit board having the capacitor structure also has sufficient reliability at high temperature and high humidity.",

        "First, in the process of FIG. 32A, by sputtering, the insulating film 45 is formed on the Si substrate 241 having a thermal oxide film formed on a surface thereof, and then the lower electrode film 47A, the dielectric film 48-1A, an intermediate electrode film 167-1A, the dielectric film 48-2A, an intermediate electrode film 167-2A, a dielectric film 48-3A, and the upper electrode film 49A are successively stacked so as to form a thin film capacitor multilayer body.",
        "Specifically, for example, using a multi-target DC-RF magnetron sputtering device, a SiO2 film (100 nm in thickness) is formed as the insulating film 45 on the Si substrate 241 having a thermal oxide film formed on a surface thereof with the substrate temperature being 200\u00b0 C. Next, with the substrate temperature being 600\u00b0 C., a Pt film (100 nm in thickness) is formed as the lower electrode film 47A in an Ar atmosphere. Next, with the substrate temperature being 600\u00b0 C., a BST film (100 nm in thickness) is formed as the first dielectric film 48-1A in an Ar/O2 atmosphere. Next, with the substrate temperature being 300\u00b0 C., a Pt film (100 nm in thickness) is formed as the intermediate electrode film 167-1A in an Ar atmosphere. Next, a BST film (100 nm in thickness) is formed as the second dielectric film 48-2A. Next, a Pt film (100 nm in thickness) is formed as the intermediate electrode film 167-2A. Next, a BST film (100 nm in thickness) is formed as the third dielectric film 48-3A. Next, a Pt film (100 nm in thickness) is formed as the upper electrode film 49A. In forming the intermediate electrode film 167-2A and the upper electrode film 49A, the same film formation conditions as for the intermediate electrode film 167-1A are employed. In forming the second and third dielectric films 48-2A and 48-3A, the same film formation conditions as for the first dielectric film 48-1A are employed. These multilayer films 45, 47A, 48-1A, 167-1A, 48-2A, 167-2A, 48-3A, and 49A may be formed by a method other than sputtering, such as vapor deposition or CVD.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 32B, the stacked films 47A, 48-1A, 167-1A, 48-2A, 167-2A, 48-3A, and 49A are patterned together by ion milling, so that the thin film capacitors 248 each including the lower electrode 47, the three layers of the dielectric films 48-1 through 48-3, the intermediate electrodes 167-1 and 167-2, and the upper electrode 49 are formed. Specifically, a resist film having openings corresponding to the positions of formation of the opening parts 261A through 261C is formed, and the opening parts 261A through 261C are formed by ion milling by inputting ions at an angle with the Si substrate 241.",
        "Next, the thin film capacitors 248 are subjected to heat treatment in an oxygen atmosphere so as to remove thermal distortion from the dielectric films 48-1 through 48-3 and supply oxygen atoms to oxygen deficient parts in the dielectric films 48-1 through 48-3. The lower electrode 47, the intermediate electrodes 167-1 and 167-2, and the upper electrode 49 of each thin film capacitor 248 are formed by patterning the lower electrode film 47A, the intermediate electrode films 167-1A and 167-2A, and the upper electrode film 49A, respectively.",
        "By thus forming the thin film capacitors 248 before forming the through holes 242, it is possible to form the dielectric films 48-1 through 48-3 at high temperature, so that the thin film capacitors 248 having a high dielectric constant, large capacitance, and high reliability can be formed. Further, by stacking the lower electrode film 47A, the dielectric film 48-1A, the intermediate film 167-1A, the dielectric film 48-2A, the intermediate film 167-2A, the dielectric film 48-3A, and the upper electrode film 49A in sequence in a vacuum, it is possible to prevent dust or foreign materials from adhering to the stacked films 47A, 48-1A, 167-1A, 48-2A, 167-2A, 48-3A, and 49A, and to prevent the surface of each of the films 47A, 48-1A, 167-1A, 48-2A, 167-2A, 48-3A, and 49A from being contaminated. As a result, it is possible to increase the yield of the thin film capacitors 248.",

        "Next, in the process of FIG. 32C, the protection film 249 is formed so as to cover the thin film capacitors 248. Next, openings 249A through 249E are formed in the protection film 249 by ion milling. The openings 249A correspond to the positions of formation of the vias 251A through 251C, and expose the insulating film 45. The openings 249B correspond to the positions of formation of the vertical interconnection lines 252, and expose the lower electrode 47.

The openings 249E correspond to the positions of formation of the vertical interconnection lines 255, and expose the upper electrode 49.",
        "Next, the protection film 249 is subjected to post-annealing in an oxygen atmosphere. Specifically, for example, an amorphous alumina film (50 nm in thickness) is formed as the protection film 249 by sputtering using an RF magnetron sputtering device. The protection film 249 may be formed by a method other than sputtering, such as vapor deposition or CVD.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 32D, the insulating film 250 is formed so as to cover the upper surface of the structure shown in FIG. 32C. Next, the opening parts 250A through 250E are formed in the insulating film 250. Specifically, for example, a photosensitive polyimide resin (2 \u03bcm in thickness) is applied as the insulating film 250 by spin coating. The opening parts 250A through 250E are formed by exposing the photosensitive polyimide resin to light and developing the photosensitive polyimide resin. The insulating film 250 may also be formed by a method other than spin coating, such as spraying or dipping.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 32E, a metal film 307 serving as a plating seed layer is formed on the structure shown in FIG. 32D. Specifically, for example, a Ti film, a Cu film, and a Ni film are successively formed by sputtering so as to serve as the metal film 307. The metal film 307 may be formed by a method other than sputtering, such as vapor deposition or CVD. Next, a resist layer 308 having opening parts (holes) 308A is formed on the metal film 307. The opening parts 308A correspond to the positions of formation of the pad electrodes 256 through 258.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 32F, the vias 251A through 251C are formed in the corresponding opening parts 250A, and the vertical interconnection lines 252 through 255 are formed in the opening parts 250B through 250E, respectively. Next, the pad electrodes 256 through 258 are formed. Specifically, a Cu film is deposited on part of the metal film 307 corresponding to the opening parts 250A through 250E by electroplating, thereby forming the vias 251A through 251C and the vertical interconnection lines 252 through 255 simultaneously. Thereafter, a Ni film to serve as the pad electrodes 256 through 258 is formed by electroplating.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 32G, a conductive material 309 of Sn\u2014Ag solder is formed on the pad electrodes 256 through 258. The resist layer 308 is removed after the formation of the conductive material 309. The conductive material 309 is later reflowed so as to serve as the external connection terminals 301 through 303.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 32H, an unnecessary part of the metal film 307 not covered with the pad electrodes 256 through 258 is removed. Next, the conductive material 309 is reflowed by heating, so that the external connection terminals 301 through 303 are formed.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 32I, the holding substrate 70 is adhered through the adhesive tape 69 to the structure shown in FIG. 32H on its first main surface side (the side on which the external connection terminals 301 through 303 are formed), and the Si substrate 241 is thinned from the second main surface side. Specifically, for example, the Si substrate 241 is thinned down with a grinder so that its thickness M2 is reduced to 50 \u03bcm. After thinning down the Si substrate 241, the adhesive tape 69 is removed. For example, grinding or etching may be employed to thin down the Si substrate 241. As grinding methods, polishing such as buffing and CMP and cutting are employable, for example. As etching methods, wet etching and plasma etching are employable, for example.",
        "Thus, thinning down the Si substrate 241 before forming the through holes 242 makes it possible to reduce the aspect ratio of the through holes 242 and form the through holes 242 using plasma etching or wet etching lower in cost than ICP (Induction Coupling Plasma). Accordingly, it is possible to manufacture the semiconductor device 240 at lower cost.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 32J, the through holes 242 of the diameter R3 are formed in the Si substrate 241 from its lower surface 241B. Specifically, for example, the through holes 242 of the diameter R3 may be formed with a disposition pitch of 250 \u03bcm by wet etching using a liquid mixture of hydrogen fluoride and a nitric acid as etching liquid. Plasma etching or wet etching using other etching liquids may also be employed.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 32K, the insulating material 243 is applied so as to fill in the through holes 242 and to cover the lower surface 241B of the Si substrate 241, and thereafter, the insulating material 243 is hardened. Specifically, for example, an epoxy resin, which is a heat-resistant resin, is applied as the insulating material 243 by spin coating, and thereafter, the epoxy resin is thermoset at a temperature of 200\u00b0 C. The insulating material 243 may also be applied by a method other than spin coating, such as spraying or dipping.",
        "By thus forming the insulating material 243 so that the insulating material 243 simultaneously covers the lower surface 241B of the Si substrate 241 and fills in the through holes 242, it is possible to simplify the manufacturing process of the semiconductor device 240 compared with the case of providing an insulating material on the lower surface 241B of the Si substrate 241 and an insulating material filling in the through holes 242 separately.",
        "Employment of a resin material such as a low-k resin, a heat-resistant resin, or a photosensitive resin as the insulating material 243 filling in the through holes 242 makes it possible to form the through holes 313A through 313C for forming the through vias 244A through 244C with ease, so that it is possible to manufacture the semiconductor device 240 at reduced cost.",
        "An insulating material on the lower surface 241B of the Si substrate 241 and an insulating material filling in the through holes 242 may be provided separately. In this case, the insulating material provided on the lower surface 241B of the Si substrate 241 may be different from the insulating material filling in the through holes 242.",

Specifically, the through holes 313A through 313C are formed by processing the insulating material 243 by ArF excimer laser processing using a heat-resistant resin or a low-k resin as the insulating material 243. The through holes 313A through 313C may also be formed using a laser processing method other than ArF excimer laser processing, or plasma etching. In the case of using a photosensitive resin as the insulating material 243, the through holes 313A through 313C may be formed by exposing and developing part of the insulating material 243 corresponding to the through holes 313A through 313C.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 32M, a metal film 315 to serve as a plating seed layer is formed so as to cover the lower surface side of the structure shown in FIG. 32L. Next, a resist layer 316 having opening parts (holes) 316 is formed on the metal film 315. The opening parts 316A correspond to the positions of formation of the pad electrodes 246A through 246C, and expose the metal film 315.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 32N, the through vias 244A through 244C are formed in the through holes 313A through 313C. Next, the pad electrodes 246A through 246C are formed on part of the metal film 315 and the through vias 244A through 244C exposed in the resist layer 316. Specifically, a Cu film is deposited by electroplating on the through holes 313A through 313C, thereby forming the through vias 244A through 244C.

        "Next, in the process of FIG. 320, a conductive material is provided on the pad electrodes 246A through 246C. Specifically, the conductive material formed of Sn\u2014Ag solder is provided on the pad electrodes 246A through 246C. The conductive material 318 is later reflowed so as to serve as the external connection terminals 247.",
        "Next, in the process of FIG. 32P, an unnecessary part of the metal film 315 not covered with the pad electrodes 246A through 246C is removed. Next, the conductive material 318 is reflowed by heating, so that the external connection terminals 247 are formed. Thereafter, the Si substrate 214 is cut by dicing, so that the semiconductor device 240 is manufactured.",
        "According to the semiconductor device manufacturing method of this embodiment, since the Si substrate 241 is thinned down, the amount of processing the Si substrate 241 in the direction of thickness is reduced in forming the through holes 242. Accordingly, the through holes 242 can be formed with ease. Further, the reduction in the amount of processing the Si substrate 241 in the direction of thickness makes it possible to form the through holes 242 by wet etching or plasma etching. Accordingly, it is possible to form the through holes 242 at far lower cost than by conventional ICP. Further, the through holes 242 are filled with the insulating material 243 of a low-k resin, a heat-resistant resin, or a photosensitive resin, and the through holes 313A through 313C are formed in the insulating material 243 by laser via processing. Accordingly, it is possible to form the through holes 313A through 313C with ease. For these reasons, it is possible to manufacture the semiconductor device 240 at lower cost than conventionally.",
        "Further, the thin film capacitors 248 are formed before forming the through holes 242. This facilitates processing for the thin film capacitors 248, and prevents dust and foreign materials generated in forming the through holes 242 from adhering to the thin film capacitors 248, thereby making it possible to increase the yield of the thin film capacitors 248.",
        "The electric characteristics of a semiconductor device formed by the above-described manufacturing process of FIGS. 32A through 32P were evaluated. The semiconductor device was made using the conditions specified in each process of the manufacturing. With respect to the electric characteristics, the results were a capacitance density of 12 \u03bcF/cm2, an ESR (equivalent series resistance) of 0.02 \u03a9, an ESL (equivalent series inductance) of 10 pH, and a withstand voltage of 30 V or over.

        "According to one aspect of the present invention, the thickness of the Si substrate of an interposer is less than or equal to the diameter of a through hole. Accordingly, a semiconductor device that has a through hole of good accuracy and can support a further increase in density can be realized. Further, since a capacitor is provided close to a semiconductor chip, it is possible to realize a semiconductor device having reduced equivalent series inductance so as to enable the semiconductor chip to operate at high frequencies. Furthermore, since it is easy to form the through hole, an inexpensive semiconductor device manufacturable at reduced cost can be realized.",

Accordingly, it is possible to reduce manufacturing cost. Further, thinning down the Si substrate makes it possible to reduce time for processing the through hole. Moreover, since the step of forming a capacitor is performed before the step of forming the through hole, it is possible to form the dielectric film of the capacitor at high temperature. Accordingly, it is possible to form a capacitor having a high dielectric constant, large capacitance, and high reliability.",
