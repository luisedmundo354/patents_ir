The latch unit is configured by two sets of serially coupled PMOS and NMOS transistors, whose gates and drains are cross-coupled. The amplifying unit is coupled between the latch unit and a complementary power supply for controlling the latch unit in response to a bit line signal and a complementary bit line signal. The circuit module is designed to charge or discharge the data storage node and the complementary data storage node of the latch unit in response to the bit line signal and the complementary bit line signal, without using a current path across the NMOS transistors therein, such that the data storage node and the complementary data storage node are charged or discharged in a manner insensitive to a mismatch between the two NMOS transistors.",

        "Sense amplifier (SA) is a basic component that is used for both programming and reading operations for memory devices. During the operation, a typical sense amplifier is turned on in response to the signals on a bit line and its complement. The operation of sense amplifier can be divided into a pre-charge/discharge phase and an evaluation phase. For a conventional voltage-mode sense amplifier, the evaluation speed is proportional to the evaluation chain conductivity and is inversely proportional to its capacitance. The pre-charge speed of the conventional voltage-mode sense amplifier is proportional to the pre-charge transistor conductivity and is inversely proportional to its capacitance. The capacitance of the conventional voltage-mode sense amplifier is a function of the load capacitance, evaluation chain capacitance and pre-charge transistor capacitance.",

The sense amplifier charges the latch to store a value at its data storage node in response to the bit line signal. The stored value can be reversed when the bit line signal and its complement are switched.",

The latch typically is configured by two sets of serially coupled PMOS and NMOS transistors where the PMOS transistors are coupled to a power supply and the NMOS transistors are coupled to the sense amplifier. During the operation, the bit line signal and its complement activate the sense amplifier to selectively charge or discharge the storage nodes through the NMOS transistors. Due to reasons, such as fabrication process variation, the two NMOS transistors can have mismatched electric characteristics, such as different threshold voltages. This can significantly delay the time for the sense amplifier to access the storage nodes of the latch. Moreover, as the semiconductor devices continue to shrink in size, the NMOS transistors within the latch becomes increasingly susceptible to process variation, thereby resulting in a higher chance of mismatch.",
        "Thus, it is desirable to have a latch type sense amplifier that is insensitive to the device mismatch issues.",
        "The present invention discloses a latch type sense amplifier. In one embodiment of the invention, the latch type sense amplifier includes a latch unit, an amplifying unit and a circuit module for charging or discharging the latch unit. The latch unit includes a first PMOS transistor and a second PMOS transistor coupled to a power supply in parallel, and a first NMOS transistor and a second NMOS transistor serially coupled to the first and second PMOS transistors, respectively. The drains of the first PMOS and NMOS transistors are coupled to gates of the second PMOS and NMOS transistors at a data storage node for storing a value. The drains of the second PMOS and NMOS transistors are coupled to gates of the first PMOS and NMOS transistors at a complementary data storage node for storing a complementary value. The amplifying unit is coupled between the latch unit and a complementary power supply for controlling the latch unit in response to a bit line signal and a complementary bit line signal. The circuit module is designed to charge or discharge the data storage node and the complementary data storage node in response to the bit line signal and the complementary bit line signal, without using a current path across the first or second NMOS transistor, such that the data storage node and the complementary data storage node are charged or discharged in a manner insensitive to a mismatch of electrical characteristics between the first and second NMOS transistors.",

        "FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional latch type sense amplifier 100 that is sensitive to mismatch issues. The latch type sense amplifier 100 includes a basic sense amplifier 102, a latch 104, two pre-charge PMOS transistors 106 and 108, and two PMOS pass-gate transistors 110 and 112. The basic sense amplifier 102 includes three NMOS transistors 114, 116, and 118, while the conventional latch 104 includes three PMOS transistors 120, 122, and 124, as well as two NMOS transistors 126 and 128.",
        "For the latch 104, the gates of the PMOS transistor 120 and the NMOS transistor 126 are tied together at a node 130 while the drains of both transistors 120 and 126 are also connected at a node 132. The gates of the PMOS transistor 122 and the NMOS transistor 128 are coupled together at the node 132 while the drains of the two transistors 122 and 128 are also connected at the node 130. The PMOS transistor 124 is implemented between the nodes 130 and 132 for biasing purposes. The sources of both PMOS transistors 120 and 122 are tied to a power supply while the sources of both NMOS transistors 126 and 128 are coupled to the basic sense amplifier 102 through nodes 134 and 136. The PMOS transistors 106 and 108 are implemented for pre-charge purposes for the amplifier 100 where the drain of the PMOS transistor 106 is coupled to the node 130 and the drain of the PMOS transistor 108 is coupled to the node 132. Both gates of the PMOS transistors 106 and 108 are coupled to their corresponding pre-charge signals that control the on and off states of the transistors to allow the power supply to pre-charge the amplifier 100.",
        "For the basic sense amplifier 102, the NMOS transistor 118 is designed to control the operation state of the amplifier 100 in response to a sense amplifier enable signal provided at its gate. The gates of NMOS transistors 114 and 116 are tied to a bit lines signal BL and a complementary bit line signal BLB, respectively. Only one of the two NMOS transistors 114 and 116 is designed to be turned on at one time by a high signal provided from its corresponding bit line signal or complementary bit line signal. The sources of the NMOS transistors 114 and 116 are coupled together at a node 138, while the drain of the NMOS transistor 114 is coupled to the node 134, and the drain of the NMOS transistor 116 is coupled to the node 136. The PMOS pass-gate transistors 110 and 112, with their gates connected to a pass-gate control signal, are implemented for selection of the entire latch type sense amplifier 100. The PMOS pass-gate transistors 110 and 112 must be turned on in order for the amplifier 100 to operate.",
        "During a write operation, the NMOS transistor 118 and the PMOS pass-gate transistors 110 and 112 are all turned on. In an exemplary scenario, when the bit line signal BL is high and the complementary bit line signal BLB is low, the NMOS transistor 114 will be turned on and the NMOS transistor 116 will be turned off. This results in the node 134 being pulled low while the node 136 is pulled high by the bit line signal BL. Assuming that the node 130 is at a low state and the node 132 is at a high state before the PMOS pass-gate transistors 110 and 112 are selected, the NMOS transistor 126 stays off and the NMOS transistor 128 stays on. After the PMOS pass-gate transistors 110 and 112 are selected, the node 130 is charged to high by the bit line signal BL. As a result, the NMOS transistor 126 will be turned on, the PMOS transistor 120 will be turned off, and the value at the node 132 will be flipped from high to low.",
        "This conventional latch type sense amplifier 100 is susceptible to mismatch issues between the NMOS transistors 126 and 128. For example, the threshold voltages of the transistors may differ substantially, due to reasons such as fabrication process variation. Since the nodes 130 and 132 are charged or discharged through current paths across the NMOS transistors 126 and 128, the mismatch issue may cause the timings for changing the nodes 130 and 132 to be imbalanced. In a serious case, this may cause the amplifier 100 to fail. As semiconductor devices continue to shrink in size as the processing technology advances, the mismatch issue becomes a critical reliability and performance concern in IC designs.",
