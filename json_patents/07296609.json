        "In the present invention, as shown in FIG. 1, openings are provided each having a slit provided therein. In accordance with the invention, the slit can be of any shape or size desired, whether straight, curved, or so forth. Likewise it can be of any width desired, whether a uniform width, or a width which changes over the length of the slit, e.g. in an hourglass shape, as with slit 390 of FIG. 33.",
        "In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, each opening is reinforced with a fastener such as a ring 10. Ring 10 can be made of homo polypropylene, ABS, or other suitable materials. These materials are strong enough to support the various fabrics commonly used for curtains, drapes, and so forth. In addition, they also have excellent memory so that, after being flexed to fit over the rod, the ring automatically springs back to its original position.",
        "As disclosed in the '232 patent, pairs of rings can be provided having a horizontal slit connecting each pair. In a further embodiment of the invention, the hanging product includes at least one external slit therein. By external slit, the present application refers to a slit which passes through the material of the hanging product (and through a ring as well if one is provided) to ultimately exit outside the suspended material 20. Examples of external slits are horizontal external slit 12 and vertical external slit 17. Various other examples of external slits are provided herein.",
        "The external slit can be in any orientation and, when used in conjunction with a ring, can extend through any position on the ring, whether the \u201c12 o'clock\u201d position, or to 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, or so forth. Rings with external slits can be provided to the hanging product in addition to the horizontally slit rings of the '232 patent, as shown, for example, in FIG. 1. Alternatively, the hanging product can be provided with externally slit rings only.",
        "In the embodiment shown in the FIG. 1, the ring 10 is located within the suspended material 20 and external slit 17 extends from the ring and through the suspended material 20, exiting at the suspended material 20's edge. In other words, a space of suspended material 20 exists between the ring 10 and the outside of the suspended material 20, and the external slit extends through that space. Ring 10, as with the other rings or fasteners of the present invention can be attached to the hanging product via any desired secure means. For example, the rings can be attached by staking, by sealing, by sewing, by welding, or by using any of the methods of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/150,876, filed Aug. 26, 1999, whose contents are fully incorporated herein by reference.",
        "In one embodiment of the invention, as shown in FIG. 1, a closed ring 10 is provided. The term closed ring refers to the fact that the external slit is normally \u201cclosed\u201d\u2014i.e. the two radial edges which form the slit 17 are pressed together. In this embodiment, the ring has some degree of flexibility, and must be flexed for the slit to open, i.e. for the edges of the slit to move some distance apart. Flexing the ring increases the width of the gap to insert the ring over the rod. The slit extends through the ring until the edge of the hanging product (whether that edge of the hanging product is beyond the edge of the ring or coincides with it as shown in various embodiments below).",
        "In an alternate or additional embodiment of the invention, as shown in FIG. 2, an open ring 30 is provided in the material 32 for attachment of the hanging product to the rod or bar 34. In accordance with this embodiment, ring 30 is an open ring which is provided with rounded edges 36. A space is provided between the edges of the open ring, forming a mouth or gap 38 which acts as the external slit. Preferably, the gap is approximately 1/16\u2033 to \u215b\u2033 in diameter, although larger or smaller gaps can be used, depending on the application, rod size, and shape. Further preferably, the upper edge of ring 30 is tangent to the upper edge 39 of suspended material 32.",
        "In this embodiment, rounded edges 36 and mouth 38 form an external slit design which is easier for a person to attach to rod 34. The embodiment of FIG. 2 is to be contrasted with the embodiment shown in FIG. 1. As shown in FIG. 1, a closed ring is provided having a radial slit therethrough. The ring is closed in that the slit 17 consists of a right radial edge and a left radial edge of the ring, those right and left radial edges being pressed against each other. In contrast, the embodiment of FIG. 2 provides an open ring structure in which a gap exists between the left radial edge 36a of the ring and the right radial edge 36b of the ring, radial edges 36a and 36b being the edges extending from the outer circumference or outer edge 26 to the inner circumference or inner edge 28 of the fastener or ring.",
        "Furthermore, it is preferred that the radial edges of the open ring be rounded as shown in FIG. 2. Open mouth 38 and rounded edges 36 facilitate the attachment of the ring to the rod from below, and further facilitate the attachment of the ring with one hand. These features are of general advantage to all users, and are of particular advantage to those who may be shorter such as children and the handicapped, or who have trouble opening the ring due to problems such as arthritis.",
        "FIG. 3 illustrates the embodiment of FIG. 2 as attached to rod 34. In addition to providing ease of attachment, the embodiment of FIG. 2 also provides ease of detachment. Furthermore, as a safety function, if the suspended material is pulled strongly enough from the bottom, the ring and suspended material will easily detach from the rod before pulling the rod out of the wall due to the presence of the wide mouth.",
        "In an alternate embodiment of the invention, ring 50 is elongated in shape, as shown in FIG. 4a. In the preferred embodiment, the elongated shape is an oval. The elongated shape of the ring facilitates attachment of the ring to a square or rectangular rod. As a result, the embodiment can be utilized with drapes, window treatments, blinds, and so forth. Ring 50 can include an open mouth 58, as in the embodiment of FIG. 2, or, alternatively, it can have a closed mouth, such as shown in FIG. 1 and, for example, FIGS. 22-27. The ring can also have the upper edge of ring 50 tangent to upper edge 59 of the suspended material. As an alternative to the use of an oval, which is preferred, the elongated ring can be any non-circular shape, including, for example, a rectangle or quadrilateral. One such shape is provided in FIG. 4(b). Moreover, the external and/or internal edges of the ring need not be rounded although they are preferably so.",
        "The ring 50 can be elongated vertically, as shown in FIG. 4(a), or can be elongated horizontally, as shown in FIG. 4(b). Use of the horizontally elongated ring 70 of FIG. 4(b) allows the curtain 72 to spread more in a lateral direction (i.e. from left to right) along the curtain rod. The same curtain will spread out or widen more along a rod 74 using the horizontally elongated ring of FIG. 4(b) than it would using a rounded ring such as the ring 30 of FIG. 2. Thus, using the embodiment of FIGS. 4(b) and 4(c), less curtain material is needed to cover the width of a given window, or to extend along the width of a given shower, or so forth. The width of curtain material necessary is less than with the hooks of the prior art and is also less than with the external slit embodiment shown in FIG. 2. This embodiment is also useful in conjunction with pleated curtains (including shower curtains), blinds, portierres, room dividers, window treatments, drapery, curtains sharper folds, and the like, as in FIG. 4(c).",
        "An illustration of a comparison of the unmodified invention of the '232 patent to the external slit inventions of the present application is shown in FIGS. 5 through 8. FIG. 5 is a front view of the invention of the '232 patent, with FIG. 7 being a top view thereof. FIG. 6 is a front view of the external slit inventions herein, with FIG. 7 being a top view thereof.",
        "As shown in the figures, in some instances the external slit devices may be used to provide certain patterns of flow of a curtain (e.g. the way it folds, hangs, etc). Depending on the desired results, they may be used in conjunction with the rings of the '232 device or by themselves. As shown in FIG. 5 and in the top view of FIG. 7, using the devices of the '232 patent, the left (and right) edge of the curtain 82 will normally point outward (away from a shower or window) when placed on a rod 84. If the end of the '232 curtain were placed on rod 84 to point inward (toward a shower or window, as shown, for example, in FIG. 8 with respect to the external slit embodiment) the horizontal slit between the rings would be forced out toward the viewer. This is unusable, however, since it would make the horizontal slit visible which is aesthetically undesirable. In the normal design of the '232 patent, the horizontal slit is only placed between every second pair of rings rather than between every pair, causing the horizontal slits to all face toward the wall and not toward the viewer. Yet, a consequence of this is that the leftmost and rightmost ends of the curtain are both concave toward the wall, as shown in FIG. 7.",
        "In many applications (such as with window curtains, for example) it is normally preferable to have the curtain concave toward the viewer, i.e. the edge pointed away from the viewer as shown in FIG. 8. This effect is produced by the external slit embodiments, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 8. When the curtain is concave in this fashion, a more aesthetic appearance is produced for the curtain. Indeed, this is the industry standard for curtains. In addition, light is more effectively blocked from the window behind the curtain since the curtain cups against the wall, and likewise water is contained more effectively in the shower, as shown in FIG. 8.",
        "The external slit inventions of the present application can also be used to facilitate the placement of multiple layers of curtains on a rod. In many applications, such hotels, motels, or so forth, a fabric curtain 100 is placed on a rod 104 with a second curtain or liner 120 placed behind it. A decorative fabric shower curtain, for example, is often provided with a plastic liner behind it, the plastic liner protecting the fabric from the water of the shower. In accordance with the external slit inventions of the present application, each layer of curtain can be removed independently from the rod 104 without the need to remove any other layer, as shown in FIGS. 9 and 10.",
        "If the liner is designed according to the inventions of the '232 patent, for example, to replace the plastic liner, the fabric curtain must first be removed from the rod, then the old liner must be removed from the rod, then the new liner is placed on the rod, and then the fabric curtain is replaced on the rod. With a liner made according to the external slit inventions herein, however, the old liner can be directly removed from the rod and a replacement liner easily placed onto the rod, without the need to remove the fabric curtain, even if the fabric curtain is made according to the '232 patent.",
        "The present inventions also eliminate the problem of possible drooping shown in FIG. 11. In some instances, e.g. with a heavy or a sheer fabric 110, or when there is a large spacing between the rings or fasteners the horizontal slit of the '232 inventions may droop, causing an aesthetically unpleasing effect. With the external slit embodiments disclosed herein, however, such droop is obviated.",
        "In addition, the present inventions allow the width and the spacing of the flow of the curtain to be adjusted more readily. Using an approach purely like the '232 patent requires an even number of rings. The use of one or more external slits (in conjunction with the '232 patent design or using only external slits), on the other hand, allows an odd number of rings which is sometimes necessary due to spacing considerations between the rings (e.g. for flow of the curtain) and due to considerations governing the necessary width of the curtain or other hanging product.",
        "In one embodiment of the present inventions, ring 130 is fully within the suspended material 132. As shown in FIG. 12, in this embodiment ring 130 is below or touching hem 137 of suspended material 132.",
        "In an alternate embodiment, ring 140 overlaps with hem 147 of the curtain or suspended material 142. Preferably, the top of ring 140 is also tangent to top edge 149 of the curtain. The cutting of a series of external slits 133 across the length of the hem 137 of the curtain can often result in a hem which will droop or hang downward. Accordingly, in the embodiment of FIG. 13, the ring 140 acts to reinforce the hem, suspending the hem upward and preventing drooping. Preferably, the ring is an open ring with rounded edges, as discussed above with respect to FIG. 2. Likewise, an open ring with rounded edges (or one of the other embodiments of the present invention), or a ring with a locking device (e.g. as shown in FIGS. 22-27) can also be substituted for the closed ring shown in the other figures of the present application. Eventhough a simple slit in a closed ring is often provided for simplicity of illustration, the present inventions are not limited to such a closed ring.",
        "In a further alternate embodiment, as shown in FIG. 16, ring 180 overlaps with the edge of the curtain 182, such that ring extends beyond hem 187. This embodiment can be used, for example, to lengthen the curtain. The embodiment can be used with a externally slit ring 180 as shown in FIG. 16, or with a horizontally slit ring 190, as shown in FIG. 17. In yet a further embodiment, a tab 175 can be placed at the bottom of a ring 170 (either horizontally slit as shown, or a externally slit ring). Tab 175 is used to attach the ring to a curtain 172, e.g. at the hem 177.",
        "Any desired fabric material can be used in accordance with the present invention. For example, the fabric material can be vinyl, cotton, polyester, polyester/cotton or any other natural or synthetic fabric, including woven or non-woven fabrics, and can be rigid, semi-rigid, paper, plastic, wood, metal, or the like. In one embodiment of the invention, two half rings are placed together to encapsulate the fabric material therein. In an alternate embodiment, a single ring is integrated into the fabric material.",
        "In a further embodiment, the ring-like shape is cut directly into the material, without attaching a ring or fastener as an intermediate attachment to the hanging material. Two such embodiments are shown in FIG. 14 (left and right radial edges of slit separate) and FIG. 33 (left and right radial edges of slit touching), although any of the slit designs of the present application can be used. Other examples of preferred embodiments are shown in FIGS. 31-32. The hanging product 160 is preferably made of a relatively rigid or semi-rigid material such as a thick vinyl, either throughout the product, or at least in the area of the ring. For example, the design can be used as part of a set of blinds or so forth. The external slit 153 can be a simple closed slit, if desired, as in FIG. 1. Alternatively, it can be a more rounded design such as shown in FIGS. 2 and 14. An open slit (i.e. one with a gap between the left and right radial edges) with rounded edges is preferred. However, closed slits with rounded radial edges can be provided in this embodiment or any other embodiment of the application, as shown in FIGS. 30-33. Such closed slits with rounded radial edges are ones in which the left and right radial edges are rounded, but are also touching when the slit is not being flexed. Such closed slits with rounded radial edges provided in rings attached to the hanging product as shown, for example, in FIG. 30.",
        "A projection, extension or finger can also be provided to the ring as shown in FIGS. 18, 19 and 20. As illustrated in the figures, in further embodiments of the invention, a ring 200, 210 or 220 is provided with a projecting edge, flange, extension, or finger 206, 216 or 226. Extensions 206, 216 or 226 are projections off of the ring (preferably off of the ring's outer circumference), which extend beyond the ring away from the hanging product (e.g. toward the ceiling). The extensions are each located adjacent to and to the side of the slit 204. Preferably two extensions are provided, one on each side of the slit. In the preferred embodiment, the slit preferably exits at the top of the product (i.e. at the 12:00 position), and as a result, the extensions are likewise preferably provided on top of the product, on both sides of the ring. Alternatively, however, the slit in any of the embodiments of the present invention can exit at any side or edge of the product (at any location on the \u201cclock face\u201d), with one or two extensions being preferably provided on the side or sides of the slit, whichever side or edge of the product is chosen.",
        "These extensions serve numerous functions. For example, they make it easier to open up the ring when flexing the ring. Extension 206 or 216 of FIGS. 18 and 19, for example, are provided to overlap hems 207 and 217, respectively, supporting the hems and preventing the drooping of the hem discussed above. Fingers 206 and 216 also cover the slit vertical edge of the hem, preventing it from fraying. Finger 226, on the other hand, is provided above the hem 227, with the ring 220 overlapping the hem to support it. In this embodiment, a portion of the ring\u2014the finger only\u2014projects above the upper edge of the curtain, similar in some ways to FIG. 16.",
        "In a further additional design, the fingers can be spread and opposed as shown in FIGS. 18 and 20. As shown in FIG. 20, for example, fingers 226 can be provided as opposed \u201cthumbs\u201d. In other words, inner edges 224a and 224b are at an angle to each other greater than 0 (zero) degrees but less than 180 degrees. This is in contrast to the inner edges 214a and 214b of the fingers of FIG. 19, which are parallel to each other. These spread fingers facilitate attachment of the rings 200 and 220 to a rod. They make it easier to slide the ring into the rod until the ring is pushed over the rod. They also make it easier to spread the ring open by hand to insert it over the rod, and to spread the ring open to remove it from the rod. They facilitate attachment whether a simple external slit through the ring is used (as shown in FIGS. 18-20), or alternatively in conjunction with open rings with rounded edges (as shown in FIG. 2).",
        "As an alternative to a straight external slit, a curved external slit 232 can be provided. Further preferably, the slit can be curved and offset, as shown, for example, in FIG. 20. In one embodiment, curved slit 232 has an upper vertical component 232a, an approximately horizontal component 232b, and a radial component 232c. Radial component 232c of slit 232 exits the inner circumference of the ring at a location which is offset to the side, rather than exiting the ring at the top of the inner circumference of ring 220 (i.e. rather than exiting directly below vertical component 232a). In this embodiment, fingers 224a and 224b are pulled to the left and right, respectively to open up the ring 220 and insert the ring over a rod. Curved slit 232, which intersects the inner circumference of the ring at an offset position rather than at the top of the ring, provides an advantage to the user in that the slit 232 will not sit directly on top of the rod while the curtain is in use. This eliminates the problem of the slit riding on the rod when the curtain is pulled open or closed. Instead, a smooth surface of the ring rides on the rod, easing movement of the curtain.",
        "It will be likewise understood, that some or all of the features of FIG. 20 can be provided to any given product. For example, the curved slit can be provided with or without offset features, whether offset intersection points, or a bottom offset from the 12:00 position. Likewise, the various features of the embodiment of FIG. 20, whether a curved slit and/or an offset and/or the fingers, can also be provided directly to the hanging product (without using a ring) as shown in FIG. 32.",
        "For example, the curved slit can be provided to exit the edge of the product at any exit point other than the top of the ring, with an offset between the intersection point of the curved slit with the inner circumference/edge of the product and the exit point of the product. In other words, by offset intersection points, the slit's endpoints are spaced from each other at their intersection points such that the two intersection points are not at the same location were they placed on a standard clock. For example, if the intersection of the curved slit with the exit point from the product were at the 12:00 position (as shown in FIG. 20), the intersection of the curved slit at the inner edge would be at a point other than the 12:00 position (approximately 1:00 in FIG. 20). Or, likewise, if the intersection of the curved slit with the exit point from the product were at the 2:60 position instead, the intersection of the curved slit at the inner edge would be at a point other than the 2:00 position.",
        "In a further embodiment, the ring 230 can be provided with a flat upper edge 235, as shown in FIG. 21. Upper edge 235 overlaps with hem 237. Upper edge 235, therefore, provides yet further support for the hem over an extended length of fabric. Using the embodiment of FIG. 21, upper edge 235 provides support over a length equal to approximately the outer diameter of the ring 230 for each ring. This upper edge can be the entire upper edge of the ring. Or, it can be used a portion of the upper edge, e.g. in conjunction with an extension off the ring, as shown, for example in FIGS. 18-20.",
        "Instead of a vertical external slit 233a, a further offset slit 233b can be provided to any of the embodiments of the invention, as shown, for example, by the dotted line in FIG. 21. Offset slit 233b is a slit which intersects the inner circle 231 in a secant-like or tangent-like fashion. Offset slit 233b is off center, such that the line it makes (if extended) would not intersect the center of inner circle 231. Or, viewing the circumference of the inner circle, the intersection point of the slit with the inner circumference or edge of the product is offset from the 12:00 position on that inner circle. This offset slit allows the ring to glide more smoothly along the rod since the slit does not sit directly on the rod's top. In this further preferred embodiment, regardless of what position is chosen for the exit of the slit from the ring or product, the intersection of the slit at the inner edge is preferably at a point offset from the 12:00 position when the product is hanging, so that the slit does not ride on the rod as previously discussed.",
        "In further embodiments of the invention, a ring is provided which can be selectively opened or sealed, i.e. \u201clocked\u201d as shown in FIGS. 22-25. FIG. 22 is a front view of ring 240, and FIG. 23 is a rear view of ring 240. As shown therein, the cut 243 in the top ring shown in FIG. 22 is spaced from the corresponding cut 244 in the bottom ring shown in FIG. 23. In other words, in a preferred embodiment, the cut does not extend through both rings in the same position\u2014as a result, the top and bottom rings have an overlap in the area between the cut in the top and bottom ring as shown in FIGS. 24 and 25. This overlap configuration can be used with any of the embodiments of the present invention. In the embodiments of FIGS. 22-25, it is used with a locking pin to secure the two rings. As shown in the figures, ring 240 includes a pin 246 which is located in this overlap area extends through a opening or channel 242. In the open position, shown in FIG. 24, the pin 246 is separated from channel 242 forming a gap for placing the ring on a rod. In the closed position, shown in FIG. 24, pin 246 inserts snugly into channel 242 to seal the ring.",
        "In further embodiments of the invention, a ring 250 is provided, as shown in FIG. 26. Ring 250 includes an internal sliding member 254 which can be pushed or pulled using knob 256. Sliding member 254 slides into and out of internal channel 258 to close and open gap 252. In an alternative embodiment, shown in FIG. 27, a pivoting member 264 is provided, having a pin 265 which inserts into an opening 266. Pivoting member 264 can be rotated to open or close gap 262. In general, the embodiments of FIG. 22-27 are useful for providing a very secure ring which cannot accidentally be pulled off of a rod. They also increases the smoothness of the sliding of the rings along the rod.",
        "In a further embodiment of the invention, a tape or strip may be provided as shown in FIG. 28. Strip 306 can be used to convert an existing curtain or other hanging product 302 into one of the present invention, or can be used to provide a hanging product in which the specific types of fasteners or provided on top can be interchanged. Strip 306 includes attachment devices 308 which attach to the top of the hanging product 302. The attachment device can be reversibly detachable, e.g. via snaps, a button and hole type design, a zipper, or a hook, or can be more permanent, e.g. via sewing, welding, adhesive, or so forth. Any other attachment methods for attaching the strip to the hanging product can be used as well. In one embodiment, an existing hanging product with holes 310 can easily be converted to one of the present invention by attaching the strip 306 to the hanging product using the holes 310. As with the other hanging products of the present invention, the hanging product 302 can be woven, non-woven, rigid, semi-rigid, or so forth.",
        "Further in accordance with the invention, any of the embodiments of the present application can be placed in sequence from right to left, as shown in FIG. 29. This allows a person to cover a long window, shower or so forth, by using two or more curtains when the item to be covered is longer than the width of a single curtain. In addition, overlaps can be used, as shown in FIG. 29. When the curtains are overlapped, the edge of one curtain 320 extends beyond the edge of the other curtain 330, minimizing or eliminating the appearance of any gap between the curtains.",
        "As shown in FIG. 30, the slit 344 can include a segment or slit 344a which extends through the hanging product 350, and a segment or slit 344b which extends through the ring 340. As previously discussed with respect to FIG. 20, the slit 344 need not be in a straight line. As shown in FIG. 30, slit 344a is at an angle to slit 344b, the angle being other than 180 degrees. If desired, the slits 344a and 344b can combine to form a curved slit, or can be two straight segments at any angle to each other, the latter being shown in FIG. 30.",
        "As shown in FIG. 31(a), in a further preferred embodiment the hanging product includes an inner cut-out area 380, also shown as 151 in FIG. 14. The hanging product includes a slit 370 which extends from the edge of the hanging product to the inner cut-out area 380. Slit 370 includes a left radial edge 375a and a right radial edge 375b. Preferably, the slit is an offset slit. Further preferably, the radius of the left radial edge 375a is different than the radius of the right radial edge 375b. FIG. 31(a) can therefore be contrasted with FIG. 33 which shows an embodiment in which the left and right radial edges 388a and 388b are of equal radii, and wherein the slit is not offset but central, along the radius of the circle. It is also preferred that the left radial edge and right radial edge contact each other, as shown in both FIGS. 31(a) and 33, although a gap can alternately be provided.",
        "A hanging product can also have a ring designed in this fashion, as shown in FIG. 31(b). Ring 400 is provided as part of hanging product 401. Ring 400 includes a slit 412. Slit 412 (and likewise ring 400) has a left radial edge 402a and a right radial edge 402b, wherein left radial edge 402a and right radial edge 402b have different radii. The ring 400 includes an edge 404 which is flat along at least a portion of the upper edge of the ring and preferably overlaps hem 406. Extension 408 off of the ring 400 further serves to ease the opening of the ring and its attachment onto a rod, and also serves to support the hem 406.",
        "Although the present inventions have been described in some embodiments using curtains as an illustration, it is to be understood that they may be used with any of the products of the related applications listed above, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "Having described this invention with regard to specific embodiments, it is to be understood that the description is not meant as a limitation since further modifications and variations may be apparent or may suggest themselves.
