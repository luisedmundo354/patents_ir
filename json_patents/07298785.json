        "This is a patent application based on Japanese patent application Nos. 2001-204131, 2001-298078, and 2001-299050, which were filed on Jul. 4, 2001, Sep. 27, 2001, and Sep. 28, 2001, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a demodulation method and apparatus for a multicarrier transmission scheme in which a plurality of subcarriers are modulated individually and the thus-obtained plurality of modulated signals are transmitted over a single symbol duration T. The present invention is particularly effective for a demodulation apparatus which receives a signal modulated in accordance with, for example, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).",
        "The present invention relates further to a multicarrier demodulation method and apparatus. The present invention is particularly effective for reception of OFDM signals at locations where delayed waves exert considerable influence.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "For example, in an OFDM scheme in which the frequency interval of N carriers is set to \u0394f (=1/T), where T is the length of a single symbol excepting a guard interval, on the modulation side, N complex digital modulated signals obtained through sampling at sampling intervals of 1/(N\u0394f) are generated by means of inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT). On the demodulation side, OFDM demodulation is performed through discrete Fourier transform (DFT) by use of N complex digital signals, which are obtained by sampling, at sampling intervals of 1/(N\u0394f), a signal from which the guard interval has been removed and which has the single symbol length T. Recently, a technique for reducing the number of sampling points of the received signal used in the above calculation; i.e., halving the single symbol length, has been reported (23rd Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications, Oct. 2000, pp. 101-104).",
        "Incidentally, on the modulation side, many nullcarriers, which are always zero, are generally contained in inputs (signals to be superposed on subcarriers) of the N-point IDFT (N-point inverse discrete Fourier transform).",
        "For example, in the OFDM modulation scheme, a waveform called a guard interval is added before each effective symbol in order to prevent deterioration of orthogonality that would otherwise occur as a result of superposition of a delayed wave. For example, the last quarter of the effective symbol is added before the effective symbol so as to make a single symbol 5/4 times its original duration. This guard interval prevents the symbol from being influenced by the delayed wave during demodulation if the delay is less than the guard interval duration. At this time, the guard interval is removed by use of a \u201cwindow\u201d corresponding to the effective symbol duration, and the waveform within the effective symbol duration is used for the demodulation.",
        "However, when a delayed wave having an excess delay longer than the guard interval arrives under the influence of multipaths, the error rate increases greatly. In such a case, the guard interval duration must be increased; however, the increased guard interval duration increases redundancy of communications, thereby lowering communication efficiency.",
        "In view of the foregoing and in view that use of an N-point DFT is not necessarily required on the demodulation side, the present invention enables a received signal to be decomposed into effective carriers other than nullcarriers without use of all digital complex signals at N sampling points of the received signal within a single symbol duration excepting a guard interval. Moreover, on the transmission side, modulation is performed in such a manner that the single symbol duration (when a guard interval is added to the symbol duration, the guard interval is excluded) is shortened to a degree such that only demodulation of effective carriers other than nullcarriers is possible. On the reception side, demodulation corresponding to the modulation is performed.",
        "In OFDM, even when a band for N carrier is used, the band includes nullcarriers such as guard bands in many cases. In view of this and in view that, in communications using multiple carriers including nullcarriers, a received signal having a shorter symbol duration can be decomposed into effective carriers, another object of the present invention is to provide a demodulation method and apparatus which decompose or demodulate a received signal into effective carriers without using a signal part having a waveform distortion stemming from delayed waves, to thereby prevent the error ratio from increasing greatly even under a multipath environment in which a delayed wave having an excess delay greater than the guard interval arrives at the demodulation side.",
        "A first feature of the present invention is a multicarrier demodulation method for a multicarrier transmission scheme adapted to receive and demodulate a signal consisting of N subcarriers which contain at least N-M (M<N) nullcarriers as subcarriers, comprising: sampling at N sampling points a received signal from which all the N subcarriers can be demodulated, to thereby obtain digital signals; extracting digital signals corresponding to M preset sampling points from the digital signals corresponding to the N sampling points; providing a matrix for demodulating, from the digital signals corresponding to M preset sampling points, to desired L subcarriers (L\u2266M) among M subcarriers other than the N-M nullcarriers, on the basis of positions on a frequency axis of the M subcarriers other than the N-M nullcarriers and positions on a time axis of the extracted sampling points; and demodulating to the desired L subcarriers among the M subcarriers other than the N-M nullcarriers from a product of the provided matrix and a vector which includes as components the digital signals corresponding to the M sampling points.",
        "The term \u201cnullcarriers\u201d used in the phrase \u201cat least N-M (M<N) nullcarriers as subcarriers\u201d refers to subcarriers which contain no information, such as guard bands and carrier holes. The \u201cN subcarriers\u201d may be subjected to complex modulation or may be modulated in such a manner that only amplitude or phase is modulated. When the N subcarriers are subjected to complex modulation, needless to say, the digital signals corresponding to the N sampling points must be complex signals. In either case, synchronization must be established by use of some means; however, the present invention is not affected by the means for synchronization.",
        "Notably, throughout the specification, the phrase \u201cdemodulating subcarriers\u201d may be used to mean \u201cextracting subcarriers\u201d or \u201cseparating to subcarriers.\u201d",
        "A second feature of the present invention is a multicarrier demodulation method for receiving and demodulating a signal consisting of N subcarriers which contain at least N-M (M<N) nullcarriers as subcarriers, comprising demodulating to desired L subcarriers (L\u2266M) among M subcarriers other than the N-M nullcarriers, by use of complex digital signals corresponding to M sampling points which are selected from complex digital signals corresponding to N sampling points quadrature-detected at sampling intervals 1/(N\u0394f), where \u0394f is a frequency interval between two adjacent subcarriers of the N subcarriers.",
        "The order of quadrature detection and sampling may be determined freely; i.e., analog-digital conversion may be performed after analog quadrature detection; or digital quadrature detection may be performed after analog-digital conversion, both cases being covered by the present invention. The number of points of inverse discrete Fourier transform is not limited to N. Moreover, the M complex digital signals may be those corresponding to the first M points in a single symbol.",
        "A modification in relation to the second feature of the present invention is a multicarrier demodulation method for receiving and demodulating a signal which has been modulated by use of inverse discrete Fourier transform and which consists of N subcarriers containing at least N-M (M<N) nullcarriers as subcarriers, comprising: sampling a signal obtained through analog quadrature detection at M sampling points having a time interval \u03b4/(N\u0394f) (0<\u03b4<1) in order to obtain complex digital signals corresponding to the M sampling points, where \u0394f is a frequency interval between two adjacent subcarriers of the N subcarriers; and demodulating to desired L subcarriers (L\u2266M) among M subcarriers other than the N-M nullcarriers, by use of the complex digital signals corresponding to the M sampling points.",
        "Another modification in relation to the second feature of the present invention is a multicarrier demodulation method for receiving and demodulating a signal which has been modulated by use of inverse discrete Fourier transform and which consists of N subcarriers containing at least N-M (M<N) nullcarriers as subcarriers, comprising: quadrature detection and sampling a received signal at time intervals 1/(\u03bdN\u0394f) (\u03bd is an integer not less than 2) in order to obtain M complex digital signals, where \u0394f is a frequency interval between two adjacent subcarriers of the N subcarriers; and demodulating to desired L subcarriers (L\u2266M) among M subcarriers other than the N-M nullcarriers, by use of the M complex digital signals. In this case, the order of quadrature detection and sampling may be determined freely; i.e., analog-digital conversion may be performed after analog quadrature detection; and digital quadrature detection may be performed after analog-digital conversion, which are both covered by this modification of the invention. Notably, the above-described complex digital signals are generally base band signals.",
        "Third and fourth features of the present invention are multicarrier demodulation apparatuses which employ the multicarrier demodulation methods according to the first and second features of the present invention. The descriptions of the terms used in claims similarly apply. The present invention also provides multicarrier demodulation apparatuses according to modifications of the fourth feature which respectively employ the multicarrier demodulation methods according to the above-described two modifications of the second feature.",
        "A fifth feature of the present invention is a multicarrier modulation method for transmitting, by use of inverse discrete Fourier transform, a signal consisting of N subcarriers which contain at least N-M (M<N) nullcarriers as subcarriers, comprising partially removing a part of each symbol which does not contain a corresponding guard interval, in order to shorten the length of the symbol from 1/\u0394f to M/(N\u0394f), where \u0394f is a frequency interval between two adjacent subcarriers of the N subcarriers. In the present invention, since a part of each symbol which does not contain a corresponding guard interval is removed partially, a signal having a length M/(N\u0394f) is naturally a part of a signal having a length 1/\u0394f, so that entire data are not transmitted within a shortened period of time. The number of points of the inverse discrete Fourier transform at the transmission side is not limited to N, which is the number of sampling points at the reception side.",
        "In the fifth feature, the desired L subcarriers (L\u2266M) among M subcarriers other than the N-M nullcarriers may be demodulated from complex digital signals corresponding to M sampling points quadrature-detected at sampling intervals 1/(N\u0394f), where \u0394f is a frequency interval between two adjacent subcarriers of the N subcarriers. In the present invention as well, the order of quadrature detection and sampling may be determined freely; i.e., analog-digital conversion may be performed after analog quadrature detection; and digital quadrature detection may be performed after analog-digital conversion, which are both covered by the present invention.",
        "A modification in relation to the fifth feature of the present invention is characterized by comprising sampling a signal obtained through analog quadrature detection at M sampling points having a time interval \u03b4/(N\u0394f) (0<\u03b4<1) in order to obtain complex digital signals corresponding to the M sampling points, where \u0394f is a frequency interval between two adjacent subcarriers of the N subcarriers; and demodulating to desired L subcarriers (L\u2266M) among M subcarriers other than the N-M nullcarriers, by use of the complex digital signals corresponding to the M sampling points. Notably, the above-described complex digital signals are generally base band signals.",
        "Another modification in relation to the fifth feature of the present invention is characterized by comprising: quadrature detection and sampling a received signal at time intervals 1/(\u03bdN\u0394f) (\u03bd is an integer not less than 2) in order to obtain M complex digital signals, where \u0394f is a frequency interval between two adjacent subcarriers of the N subcarriers; and demodulating to desired L subcarriers (L\u2266M) among M subcarriers other than the N-M nullcarriers, by use of the M complex digital signals. In this case as well, the order of quadrature detection and sampling may be determined freely; i.e., analog-digital conversion may be performed after analog quadrature detection; or digital quadrature detection may be performed after analog-digital conversion, both cases being covered by this modification of the invention.",
        "A sixth feature of the present invention resides in a multicarrier modulation apparatus which employs the multicarrier modulation method according to the fifth feature of the present invention as well as a multicarrier demodulation apparatus which employs the multicarrier demodulation method according to the fifth feature of the present invention. The descriptions of the terms used in claims similarly apply. The present invention also provides multicarrier demodulation apparatuses which respectively employ the multicarrier demodulation methods according to the two above-described modifications of the fifth feature.",

In this case as well, the above-described complex digital signals are generally base band signals. In the following features as well, demodulated digital signals are generally base band signals.",

        "The multicarrier demodulation method and apparatus according to the first through fourth features are based on the finding that although data of N subcarriers including nullcarriers are conventionally demodulated by use of a complex signal corresponding to N sampling points, when at least N-M (M<N) subcarriers are nullcarriers (e.g., guard bands and carrier holes which do not contain any information), the remaining M subcarriers can be demodulated by use of a complex signal corresponding to M sampling points (M<N) under a certain restriction. Naturally, desired L (L<M) subcarriers among the M subcarriers can be demodulated by use of a complex signal corresponding to M sampling points (M<N) under a certain restriction. Moreover, even when M-L carriers among the M subcarriers are nullcarriers, the desired L (L<M) subcarriers can be demodulated by use of a complex signal corresponding to M sampling points (M<N) under a certain restriction. Measures and restrictions which enable the above demodulation will be described later. Thus, each of the M subcarriers containing all effective carriers can be demodulated without use of the first N-M samples of the signal among the signal corresponding to N sampling points, but by use of the signal corresponding to the remaining M sampling points. In other words, demodulation can be performed at higher speed as compared with demodulation from the signal corresponding to the N sampling points.",
        "In particular, the multicarrier demodulation method and apparatus according to the first through fourth features are effective when used to receive a signal modulated by use of inverse discrete Fourier transform, such as OFDM-type signals. This is because signals modulated by use of inverse discrete Fourier transform, such as OFDM-type modulated signals, are typical in terms of design method. That is, it is possible to easily obtain a matrix (linear computation) for demodulation from M samples of a complex signal on the basis of the carrier numbers; i.e., positions on the frequency axis, of subcarriers which are not nullcarriers and the sampling numbers; i.e., positions on the time axis, of M points used for computation (the second and fourth features). When the M points selected from the N points of a single symbol are the first M points of a single symbol, demodulation can be performed at the highest speed (a modification of the second and fourth features).",
        "Moreover, when digital sampling is performed after obtainment of a base band signal by means of analog quadrature detection, the sampling intervals can be made more narrow than 1/(N\u0394f), where \u0394f is the frequency intervals of the subcarriers, whereby the demodulation speed is increased further. When the sampling intervals is set to a value obtained by dividing 1/(N\u0394f) by an integer, the order of quadrature detection and sampling can be determined freely.",
        "The modulation method and apparatus according to the fifth and sixth features premise that the demodulation side does not require a single symbol length. That is, the number of samples of a complex signal which constitute a part having a single symbol length (when a guard band is added, the guard band is excluded) is reduced from N to M, the single symbol length (when a guard band is added, the guard band is excluded) can be shortened from 1/\u0394f to M/(N\u0394f), whereby high speed, high density communications can be realized.",
        "The modifications of the fifth and sixth features are directed to a demodulation method and a demodulation apparatus which demodulate carriers modulated by the modulation method and apparatus according to the fifth and sixth features and which correspond to the demodulation method and apparatus according to the fifth and sixth features. In addition to the effects of the modulation method and apparatus according to the fifth and sixth features, the effects of the second and fourth features can be attained.",
        "Next, the seventh to eighteenth features of the present invention will be described.",
        "L effective carriers among N subcarriers having undergone OFDM modulation (L<N) can be demodulated if a pseudo inverse matrix to be described later exists. At this time, at least L sampling points are required. Therefore, N sampling points are not necessarily required. Thus, even when a delayed wave having an excess delay greater than the guard interval has arrived, L effective carriers (L<N) can be demodulated by use of, for example, M sampling points (L\u2266M\u2266N) counted from the end of the effective symbol, if waveform distortion on account of the excess delay does not affect the M sampling points. That is, influences of the waveform distortion caused by the delayed wave can be removed before the effective carriers are separated and demodulated. However, this is an ideal case, because in practice the subcarriers are affected by noise. Thus, there can be realized a demodulation method and apparatus whose error rate does not increase greatly even when a delayed wave having an excess delay greater than the guard interval arrives (the seventh, eighth, eleventh, and twelfth features). Moreover, when only delayed waves each having an excess delay less than the guard interval arrive, influences of noise can be suppressed through employment of sampling points which are greater in number than the N sampling points of the effective symbol (the eighth and twelfth features).",
        "Moreover, influences of interference caused by delayed waves can be suppressed more effectively through applying one or plurality of interference-component removal steps, as follows. After influences of waveform distortion caused by a delayed wave are removed in the same manner as described above, M samples for separating effective carriers are extracted. In this case, L and M are not necessarily required to satisfy L\u2266M, and the interference-component removal step(s) can be performed even when M<L. Subsequently, L subcarriers are separated by means of matched filters in such a manner that influences of noise are minimized. Subsequently, inter-carrier interference components of the signals of the L subcarriers separated by means of the matched filters are removed gradually, as follows. First, L symbols are tentatively decided from the L subcarriers separated by means of the matched filters. At this time, characteristics of the propagation channel are considered. Next, from the L tentative symbol decisions, the inter-carrier interference components contained in the L subcarrier signals are calculated in consideration of the characteristics of the propagation channel and the M-point symbol part to be used. When the inter-carrier interference components are subtracted from the signals of the L subcarriers separated by means of the matched filters, more accurate signals of the L subcarriers can be obtained.",
        "The second and subsequent interference-component removal steps are performed as follows. In consideration of the characteristics of the propagation channel, L symbols are tentatively decided from the signals of the L subcarriers obtained in the preceding stage and having higher accuracy. Next, from the L tentative symbol decisions, the inter-carrier interference components contained in the L subcarrier signals are calculated in consideration of the characteristics of the propagation channel and the M-point symbol part to be used. When the inter-carrier interference components are subtracted from the signals of the L subcarriers separated by means of the matched filters, more accurate signals of the L subcarriers can be obtained (the ninth, tenth, thirteenth, and fourteenth features).",
        "The fifteenth feature is a generalization of the above-described feature. Specifically, the fifteenth feature enables demodulation by use of a matrix in the case in which the number of subcarriers and arrangement of the subcarriers on the frequency axis are determined arbitrarily, and the number of sampling points and arrangement of the sampling point on the time axis are determined arbitrarily. The sixteenth feature enables demodulation of a received signal by use of a matrix in the case in which subcarriers and sampling points are arranged at equal intervals.",

Expression (2) shows that a vector consisting of M complex numbers x(nq) is the product of a matrix whose element in the qth row and the pth column is exp(2\u03c0jkpnq/N) and a vector consisting of M complex numbers X(kp). Therefore, the question of whether the vector consisting of M complex numbers X(kp) can be obtained from the vector consisting of M complex numbers x(nq) is equivalent to the question of whether the matrix whose element in the qth row and the pth column is exp(2\u03c0jkpnq/N) has an inverse matrix.",

The inverse matrix is an N-by-N matrix whose element in the (k+1)th row and the (n+1)th column is WNkn, where WN=exp(\u22122\u03c0j/N); 0\u2266k\u2266N\u22121; 0\u2266n\u2266N\u22121; the relation corresponding to that between IDFT (N-point inverse discrete Fourier transform) and DFT (N-point discrete Fourier transform). Meanwhile, a considerably wide range of methods can be used to select sets {kp} and {nq} each consisting of M mutually different integers not less than 0 but not greater than N\u22121, so as to meet the condition that the matrix whose element in the qth row and the pth column is exp(2\u03c0jkpnq/N) has an inverse matrix. However, in the following manner, one can judge whether or not sets {kp} and {nq} render the matrix whose element in the qth row and the pth column is exp(2\u03c0jkpnq/N) not to have an inverse matrix; i.e., one can make the sets {kp} and {nq} satisfy the requirement that the matrix whose element in the qth row and the pth column is exp(2\u03c0jkpnq/N) has an inverse matrix.",

Specifically, focusing on the q\u2032th row and the p\u2032th column, all elements are divided by exp(2\u03c0jkp\u2032nq\u2032/N), the pth column (p\u2260p\u2032) is divided by exp(2\u03c0j(kp\u2212kp\u2032)nq\u2032/N), and the qth column (q\u2260q\u2032) is divided by exp(2\u03c0jkp\u2032(nq\u2212nq\u2032)/N). Through these division operations, all the elements in the q\u2032th row and the p\u2032th column can be made 1. Here, for rows, a divisor b of N (N=ab) is obtained, and a residue system (the number of element is represented by B) of {nq} which has the largest number of elements, among b-based residue systems, is selected. For columns, all components of the first column are set to 1.

        "The work up to this point is realized through processing of obtaining residue systems of the set {nq} of integers by use of a divisor b of N; exchanging rows corresponding to a residue system which has the largest number of elements (the number is represented by B) with the first through Bth rows; dividing all elements by exp(2\u03c0jk1n1/N); dividing the pth column (p\u22601) by exp(2\u03c0j(kp\u2212k1)n1/N), and dividing the qth column (q\u22601) by exp(2\u03c0jk1(nq\u2212n1)/N). These are so-called elementary transformations of matrices, and such transformations have no effect on the question of whether the determinant of a matrix is zero.",
        "When the number of types of a-based residue systems of the column {kp} is represented by A, the number of possible arrangements of the components in each of the first through Bth rows is A. In actuality, in the matrix of Expression (3), the number of types of residue systems of {kp}={0, 1, 4, 5, 8} obtained for a=4 is 2 (i.e., A=2); i.e., {0, 4, 8} and {1, 5}. In Expression 4 transformed from Expression 3 (the transformation does not relate to whether the determinant is zero), the number of types of patterns of components in the first to third rows is only two; i.e., the first, third, and fifth columns have one type of pattern, and the second and fourth columns have another type of pattern.",
        "The above consideration clearly shows the following.",
        "[1] In the case where A<B, when a matrix corresponding to the determinant after transformation is converted to a lower triangular matrix, the diagonal components become zero in a range from the component in the (A+1)th row and the (A+1)th column to the component in the Bth row and the Bth column, thereby indicating that the original determinant is zero. For example, when the matrix of Expression 4 (wherein A=2 and B=3) is converted to a lower triangular matrix, the component in the 3rd row and the 3rd column becomes zero.",
        "[2] When A\u2267B is satisfied for all pairs of divisors a and b of N (excepting 1 and N) (the rows are exchanged with the columns, and the number of types of residue systems of the row {nq} and a residue system which has the largest number of elements among the residue systems of the column {kp} are also considered), a matrix corresponding to the determinant after transformation can be converted to a lower triangular matrix without fail, thereby indicating that the original determinant is not zero.",
        "Therefore, when N is a prime number, the above-described matrix has an inverse matrix. When N is not a prime number, sets {kp} and {nq} each consisting of M integers are considered for residue systems obtained for all pairs of divisors a and b (excepting 1 and N) of N (N=ab). When there exists a pair of divisors a and b of N such that the number A of types of a-based residue systems of {kp} is smaller than the maximum value B of the number of elements of residue systems of {nq}, the determinant is zero. When such a pair of divisors a and b of N does not exist at all (the rows are exchanged with the columns, and the number of types of residue systems of the row {nq} and a residue system which has the largest number of elements among the residue systems of the column {kp} are also considered), the determinant is not zero.",
        "Further, it is also apparent that the question of whether the M-by-M matrix whose element in the qth row and the pth column is exp(2\u03c0jkpnq/N) (sets {kp} and {nq} each consisting of M integers satisfy the conditions 1\u2266p, q\u2266M; 0\u2266kp, nq\u2266N\u22121; kp<kp+1; nq<nq+1) has an inverse matrix (whether the determinant is not zero) is equivalent to the question of whether an (N-M)-by-(N-M) matrix whose element in the q\u2032th row and the p\u2032th column is exp(2\u03c0jkp\u2032nq\u2032/N) (1\u2266p\u2032, q\u2032\u2266N\u2212M; 0\u2266kp\u2032, nq\u2032\u2266N\u22121; kp\u2032<kp\u2032+1; nq\u2032<nq\u2032+1; kp\u2032\u2260kp; nq\u2032\u2260nq) has an inverse matrix (i.e. the question of whether the determinant is not zero). This is because the above two matrices correspond to different M-by-M and (N-M)-by-(N-M) matrices extracted from the matrix of the N-point IDFT (an inverse matrix is the matrix of the DFT). This scheme is particularly effective for the case where M is greater than N/2, because fewer residue systems of sets can be considered.",
        "Even when any set {nq} consisting of M mutually different integers is selected to be used together with a set {kp} consisting of M mutually consecutive integers, the M-by-M matrix whose element in the qth row and the pth column is exp(2\u03c0jkpnq/N) has an inverse matrix. Similarly, even when any set {kp} consisting of M mutually different integers is selected to be used together with a set {nq} consisting of M consecutive integers, the M-by-M matrix whose element in the qth row and the pth column is exp(2\u03c0jkpnq/N) has an inverse matrix. These statements are equivalent to each other.",
        "Among these statements, the latter can be proved as follows. Specifically, the maximum value B of the number of elements of residue systems of the set {nq} consisting of M consecutive integers obtained by use of the above-described b (N=ab) is \u2212[\u2212M/b]. [R] is a Gauss symbol and represents the largest integer which is not greater than the real number R. The minimum value of the number A of types of residue systems of the set {kp} consisting of M different integers obtained by use of the above-described a becomes \u2212[\u2212M/b], because the largest number of elements of the a-based residue systems obtained is b (=N/a). In other words, the maximum value B of the number of elements of b-based residue systems of the set {nq} consisting of M consecutive integers is equal to the minimum value of the number A of types of a-based residue systems of the set {kp} consisting of M different integers. At this time, B does not exceed A.",
        "Moreover, if N=cm (c is a prime number, and m is an integer not less than 2), for the set {kp} consisting of M integers whose cm\u2032-based residue systems (m\u2032=[logcM], [R] is a Gauss symbol and represents the largest integer which is not greater than the real number R) completely matches (in terms of types of residues systems and number of elements of each system) the set {kp} consisting of M consecutive integers, the M-by-M matrix whose element in the qth row and the pth column is exp(2\u03c0jkpnq/N) has an inverse matrix, whenever any set {nq} consisting of M different integers is selected. This is also true even when {nq} is exchanged with {kp}. cm\u2032 (m\u2032=[logcM]) is a factorial of the sole largest prime factor of N which is equal to or less than M. A set whose cm\u2032-based residue systems completely matches {kp} means a set of M different integers of not less than 0 but not greater than N\u22121 in which arbitrary kp of M consecutive integers has been replaced with one of kp\u00b1cmm\u2032, kp\u00b12cm\u2032, kp\u00b13cm\u2032, . . . , kp\u00b1(cm\u2212c) (however, those falling outside the range of 0 to N\u22121 are excluded).",
        "[Summary Regarding Inverse Matrix]",
        "1. When N is a prime number, a relevant matrix has an inverse matrix.\n    2. When at least one of {nq} and {kp} is a set consisting of M consecutive integers, the M-by-M matrix whose element in the qth row and the pth column is exp(2\u03c0jkpnq/N) has an inverse matrix.\n    3. When N=cm (c is a prime number, and m is an integer not less than 2), a relevant matrix has an inverse matrix even when none of {nq} and {kp} is a set consisting of M consecutive integers, as described above, provided that at least one of {nq} and {kp} is a set whose cm\u2032-based residue systems (m\u2032=[logcM]) completely match, in terms of types of residues systems and number of elements of each system, the set consisting of M consecutive integers.\n    4. Even when {nq} and {kp} are not sets other than those described above, a relevant matrix has an inverse matrix, provided that the result of a study on residue systems of the sets for all pairs of divisors a and b of N (excepting 1 and N) shows that no pair of divisors a and b of N exists such that the number A of types of a-based residue systems of {kp} is smaller than the maximum value B of the number of elements of b-based residue systems of {nq}, and that no pair of divisors a and b of N exists such that the number A of types of a-based residue systems of {nq} is smaller than the maximum value B of the number of elements of b-based residue systems of {kp}.",
        "Incidentally, it is apparent that when L desired rows are extracted from the above-described inverse matrix, which is an M-by-M matrix, so as to obtain an L-by-M matrix (L\u2266M), this matrix can be used to obtain L arbitrary carriers from M subcarriers by use of M sampling points. That is, matrices used to implement the demodulation method and the demodulation apparatus of the present invention are not limited to square matrices.",
        "Moreover, it is clear that the discussions thus far can be applied to the case in which M subcarriers contain nullcarriers. Therefore, when (M-L) nullcarriers (L<M) are assumed to be contained in M subcarriers, it is apparent that the remaining L carriers can be obtained from M sampling points by use of a matrix which is obtained by extracting L rows, which are necessary for demodulation of the L carriers, from an M-by-M matrix which is an inverse matrix of the above-described M-by-M matrix whose element in the qth row and the pth column is exp(2\u03c0jkpnq/N). Specifically, such a matrix can be obtained through a procedure of forming an M-by-M matrix by not only using integers kp corresponding to L carriers but also provisionally using (M-L) arbitrary integers kp (excepting integers kp corresponding to the L carriers), obtaining an inverse matrix of the matrix, and extracting an L-by-M matrix (L<M) corresponding to the L carriers. Through simple consideration, an indefinite number of such L-by-M matrices can be formed.",

Specifically, these digital signal trains are the real parts and imaginary parts of N+(NTGI/T) samples of a complex digital signal quadrature-detected at sampling intervals T/N, where T is the length of the effective symbol, and TGI is the length of the guard interval added before the effective symbol. Among these outputs, the preamble (pilot signal) is detected by means of the preamble extraction section 21. Thus, on the basis of data within the symbol duration having the preamble (pilot signal), the synchronization section 22 establishes synchronized operation of the entire demodulation apparatus. Moreover, the excess delay estimation section 23 detects an excess delay with respect to the latest delayed wave. The subcarrier phase/amplitude estimation section 24 detects the phases and amplitudes of the subcarriers and outputs data for equalization.",
        "On the basis of the synchronization signal from the synchronization section 22 and the data output from the excess delay estimation section 23 that represents the excess delay with respect to the latest delayed wave, the to-be-used symbol extraction section 31 extracts a to-be-used symbol from the digital signal trains of the in-phase and quadrature components I and Q as follows. From the real parts and imaginary parts of N+(NTGI/T) samples of the complex digital signal, the to-be-used symbol extraction section 31 extracts M\u2032 samples (L\u2266M\u2032<N+(NTGI/T)) are extracted, starting from the end of the effective symbol.

The matrix computation and linear operation section 32 calculates the pseudo inverse matrix (L\u00d7M\u2032) of the M\u2032-by-L matrix A (L\u2266M\u2032) whose element in the qth row and the pth column is exp(2\u03c0jkpnq/N) from a set {kP} consisting of the numbers of L subcarriers and a set {nq} consisting of the numbers of M\u2032 sampling points.

In this manner, the L effective carriers can be demodulated from the section which is not affected by the latest delayed wave. The complex signals X(kp) of the L subcarriers are supplied to the propagation channel characteristic equalization section 25. The propagation channel characteristic equalization section 25 performs equalization processing on the basis of data output from the subcarrier phase/amplitude estimation section 24 and representing the phases and amplitudes of the respective subcarriers.

When a delayed wave which is delayed from an earliest arrival wave by a time less than the length of the guard interval has arrived at the multicarrier demodulation apparatus 100 as shown in FIG. 9B, the S/N ratio can be improved by means of a to-be-used symbol longer than the effective symbol.",

The matched filter section 33 calculates L complex signals by use of matched filters corresponding to the subcarriers and matched to the length of the extracted to-be-used symbol. Here, influence of noise is minimized through separation of the L complex signals, which are the outputs of the matched filter section 33 of the multicarrier demodulation apparatus 200, by use of matched filters matched to the subcarriers. However, since the complex signals contain interference components stemming from interference with other subcarriers, the complex signals are processed by means of the inter-carrier interference removal section 40.",
        "The signals of the subcarriers separated by means of the matched filter section 33 are subjected to equalization processing which the propagation channel characteristic equalization section 411 performs on the basis of data output from the subcarrier phase/amplitude estimation section 24 and representing the phases and amplitudes of the respective subcarriers. Subsequently, the signals are fed to the subcarrier symbol decision section 412 and subjected to tentative symbol decision. Next, the signals are fed to the propagation channel characteristic reproduction section 413 in order to reproduce influences of the characteristics of the propagation channel on the basis of data output from the subcarrier phase/amplitude estimation section 24 and representing the phases and amplitudes of the respective subcarriers. Subsequently, the signals are fed to the inter-carrier interference component computation section 414. The inter-carrier interference component computation section 414 calculates inter-carrier interference on the basis of the length of the to-be-used symbol obtained from the data output from the excess delay estimation section 23 and representing the excess delay with respect to the delayed wave. The subtractor 42 subtracts the thus-obtained inter-carrier interference from the signals of the subcarriers separated by means of the matched filter section 33. Thus, more accurate subcarrier signals can be obtained.",
        "The subcarrier signals having increased accuracy may be successively processed by means of the propagation channel characteristic equalization section 25 and the symbol decision section 26. The accuracy of the subcarrier signals can be improved through employment of a plurality of inter-carrier interference removal sections 40 connected in a plurality of stages. FIG. 13 shows a configuration of n inter-carrier interference removal sections 40-1 to 40-n constructed at n stages. The inter-carrier interference removal sections 40-1 to 40-n comprise the inter-carrier interference estimation section 41-1 to 41-n and the subtractor 42-1 to 42-n. Respectively, as same as in FIG. 11. The inter-carrier interference removal section 40-1 at the first stage operates as described above. The inter-carrier interference removal section 40-i (2\u2266i\u2266n) at the second stage or subsequent stages decides each symbol tentatively on the basis of the corresponding subcarrier signals output from the inter-carrier interference removal section 40-(i-1) at the previous stage and having improved accuracy, calculates inter-carrier interference, and subtracts the thus-obtained inter-carrier interference from the signals of the subcarriers separated by means of the matched filters, which are output signals of the matched filter section 33. The resultant signals are fed to the inter-carrier interference removal section 40-(i+1) at the next stage or the propagation channel characteristic equalization section 25. In this manner, as the subcarrier signals pass through the inter-carrier interference removal section 40-i at each stage, inter-carrier interference is removed from the signals more precisely, thereby improving the accuracy of the subcarrier signals.",
        "The above-described processing will be described by use of expressions. In the following description, a column vector consisting of M\u2032 complex number x(nq) and a column vector consisting of L complex number X(kp) will be simply referred to as x and X, respectively. The meanings of the matrices A and A* are the same as described above. The waveform inputted to the matched filter section 33 is expressed by x=AX, and the waveform of each subcarrier carrying L complex numbers X(kp) is represented by exp(2\u03c0jkpnq)/N). The operation of the matched filter section 33 is to calculate between the waveforms of the subcarriers and the inputted waveform, and therefore, L complex numbers represented by A*x=A*AX are output. That is because the component in the pth row and the qth column of the L-by-M\u2032 matrix A* is exp(\u22122\u03c0jkpnq)/N). The output column vector is put as X0. Here, it is to be noted that all the diagonal components of the L-by-L matrix A*A are M\u2032.",
        "For the column vector X.sub.0, output from the matched filter section 33, as shown in FIG. 12, the propagation channel characteristic equalization section 411 and the subcarrier symbol decision section 412 at the first stage perform equalizing processing and tentative symbol decision, respectively. The propagation channel characteristic equalization section divides the signal of each subcarrier by a propagation channel characteristic coefficient corresponding to the subcarrier. Subsequently, the subcarrier symbol decision section performs tentative symbol decision. Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 12, the propagation channel characteristic reproduction section 413 multiplies the result of tentative symbol decision for each subcarrier by the propagation channel characteristic coefficient corresponding to the subcarrier. The column vector obtained as a result of the multiplication is represented by X.sub.1. Next, the inter-carrier interference component computation section 414 calculates inter-carrier interference. The calculation is to obtain A*AX.sub.1-MX.sub.1=(A*A-M\u2032E)X.sub.1. Notably, E is an unit matrix of L by L; and L is the same integer as in the cases described previously. The subtractor 42 subtracts the thus-obtained inter-carrier interference from the signals X.sub.0of the subcarriers separated by means of the matched filter section 33 in order to obtain subcarrier signals (A*A-M\u2032E) (X-X.sub.1)+M\u2032X, which have higher accuracy as compared with the signals X.sub.0. When a multi-stage configuration is employed, the inter-carrier interference removal section operates as follows. As shown in FIG. 13, inter-carrier interference removal section 40 at the second stage performs equalization processing, tentative symbol decisions and reproduction process to the output (A*A-M\u2032E) (X-X.sub.1)+M\u2032X of the inter-carrier interference removal section 40 at the first stage so as to obtain a column vector X.sub.2 and outputs (A*A-M\u2032E) (X-X.sub.2)+M\u2032X after inter-carrier interference component computation. The same processing is performed in the subsequent stages, and the inter-carrier interference removal section 40-n at the nth stage outputs (A*A-M\u2032E) (X-X.sub.n)+M\u2032X. As compared to the column vector X.sub.0, the column vectors X.sub. 1, X.sub.2, . . . , X.sub.n become closer to the column vector consisting of L complex numbers X(k.sub.p), and the degree of closeness increases progressively. From the output (A*A-M\u2032E) (X-X.sub.n)+M\u2032X of the inter-carrier interference removal section 40 at the final stage, the propagation channel characteristic equalization section 25 and the symbol decision section 26 obtain more accurate L complex numbers.",

However, these embodiments may be modified in such a manner that a matrix (A*A)\u22121A* or A* obtained on the basis of a previously assumed excess delay is stored in memory and is retrieved. When a plurality of matrices (A*A)\u22121A* or A are prepared, the demodulation apparatus can cope with various excess delays, thereby reducing the quantity of calculation during actual operation.",
