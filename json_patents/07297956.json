        "Imaging devices, such as gamma cameras and computed tomography (CT) imaging systems, are used in the medical field to detect radioactive emission events emanating from an object, and to detect transmission x-rays or transmission gamma rays attenuated by the object, respectively. An output, typically in the form of an image that graphically illustrates the distribution of the emissions within the object and/or the distribution of attenuation of the object is formed from these detections. An imaging device may have one or more detectors that detect the number of emissions, for example, gamma rays in the range of about seventy keV to about six hundred keV, and may have one or more detectors to detect x-rays and/or gamma rays that have passed through the object.",
        "Some known imaging systems include a closed ring gantry. To image a patient using a closed ring gantry, the patient ingresses and egresses the viewing area using a long travel bed that moves the patient longitudinally along an examination axis. However, such an ingress/egress configuration requires additional examining room floor space. This additional floor space is not usable during an imaging scan, but must be available during a scan to allow egress of the patient at the completion of the scan. A closed-ring gantry is also known to be less comfortable for the patient due to the claustrophobically close clearances of the gantry to the patient.",

The detector collects both emission gammas and transmission x-ray photons and/or transmission gamma rays, identifies the different photon energy levels and generates transmission data simultaneously. The two detector arrangement allows performing a scan of about one hundred eighty degrees about examination axis 114 while moving detectors 140 and 142 only through about ninety degrees of rotation about examination axis 114.

        "FIG. 3 is a side elevation view of imaging system 100 in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In a third position 300, detector transport member 122 may be positioned such that detector 142 is located in a position opposite that of detector 140 in FIG. 1. In an alternative embodiment, because, in the position shown, detector 142 provides information similar to that provided by detector 140 in FIG. 1, the final position of detectors 140 and 142 is counter-clockwise to the position shown in FIG. 1.",
        "In operation, detector transport member 122 begins a scan in a first position 170. Detector transport drive 129 may be controlled to rotate in a direction that causes detector transport member 122 to move along arcuate path 152 from position 170 to position 300 or any intermediate position therebetween. If a tomographic image (such as a SPECT image) is desired, the detector optionally pauses at increments along the path and acquires emission data from a patient. Alternatively, imaging may start at any other position and progress in any direction. A scan may include motion in one or more portions along path 152 in any direction.",
        "The emission data may be acquired at only a single position. This is especially useful when the detectors 140 and 142 are oriented at 90\u00b0 to each other, for viewing the heart from two directions. The imaging system is also configured to be used for planar imaging or biplane imaging of the heart or other portions of the body.",
        "The acquired data is passed to an imaging computer (not shown) for generation of images from the emission data and their display on a display (not shown) as is well known in the art.",
        "The above-described embodiments of an imaging system provide a cost-effective and reliable means for examining a patient. More specifically, the imaging system includes a relatively small floor space requirement by using an open gantry that allows patient ingress to and egress from an imaging system 100 viewing area through a gap in the gantry. A detector transport member 122 of the imaging system 100 is moved away from a patient's ingress path by retracting the detector support member 122 in telescoping fashion adjacent to an imaging system base 102.",
        "Exemplary embodiments of imaging system methods and apparatus are described above in detail. The imaging system components illustrated are not limited to the specific embodiments described herein, but rather, components of each imaging system may be utilized independently and separately from other components described herein. For example, the imaging system components described above may also be used in combination with different imaging systems. A technical effect of the various embodiments of the systems and methods described herein include at least one of facilitating reducing imaging system sitting requirements by reducing a floor space requirement of the imaging system.",
        "While the invention has been described in terms of various specific embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the claims."
