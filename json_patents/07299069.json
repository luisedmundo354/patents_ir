    "title": "Adapting a communications network of wireless access nodes to a changing environment",
    "abstract": "The present invention provides a method and an apparatus for adapting a communications network of a plurality of wireless access nodes, such as base stations to a changing environment. The method comprises determining a current location of at least a first user in the communications network, identifying a need for change in at least one parameter associated with a position of a first base station of the plurality of base stations based on the current location of the first user, and implementing a first response in the communications network in response to the need for change for the first base station. In this way, a self-deploying wireless access network may autonomously reposition base stations in a changing environment of user distributions across a coverage area and/or user demand by users of wireless communication devices, such as mobile units. Using indirect communication between the base stations capable of operating with different standards or protocols, a distributed algorithm may adapt the network to the changing environment. Such adaptation of the network in a distributed manner may control overall network costs of providing wireless services to mobile users.",

        "This invention relates generally to telecommunications, and more particularly, to wireless communications.",
        "Wireless access networks are generally deployed by network operators or service providers to provide a variety of media services including data and voice wireless services to users of wireless communication devices. Examples of wireless communication devices include mobile units or terminals that use a wireless access network. Examples of wireless access networks include a global system for mobile communications system (GSM), a universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), a code division multiple access (CDMA) cellular communications system, a wide local area network (WLAN), and the like, which provide transport for data, voice, video or other services.",
        "To provide media services to wireless or mobile users, a communications system typically comprises one or more wireless access nodes, such as base stations (sometimes referred to as node-Bs). A user of a mobile unit may exchange voice and/or data information with a wireless access node, e.g., a base station over an air interface. To transmit the voice and/or data information, the base station or mobile unit encodes the information according to one or more wireless telecommunication protocols such as a UMTS, GSM, CDMA protocol, and the like. The encoded information is then modulated as an electromagnetic wave to generate a radio frequency (RF) signal that is transmitted across the air interface.",
        "As desire for new feature-rich wireless services and traffic demands goes up, complexity in the management, deployment, and configuration of wireless access networks often increases. With changes in services and traffic, adaptation of a network becomes inevitable to a constantly changing environment. However, due to centralization of control, hierarchical nature of architecture and isolation from other systems, most wireless access networks may be too inflexible as far as adapting to new wireless services and traffic demands goes. As the communication systems become richer in features and capability, the isolation between systems will have to decrease since the need for rapidly deployable communications systems in areas of high-traffic density will increase.",
        "Accordingly, one issue that service providers or network operators of many communications systems may inevitably face is the increase in cost for deployment and operation of wireless access networks. For example, to increase the capacity of wireless access networks, a trend to smaller cell sizes (with a commensurate increase in the total number of cells) is clearly emerging. In combination with the additional requirement of interoperability of heterogeneous systems, the deployment and configuration of wireless access networks represents an increasing cost factor.",
        "To control these costs, a deployment process based on self-configuration of wireless access nodes is used to adapt a network to its changing environment involving changes in number, position and configuration of its wireless access nodes, user demand and location of users. Such a self-deploying network may optimize the use of the wireless access nodes. In contrast to traditional ad-hoc networks, where the configuration is optimised for the current locations of the nodes, a self-deploying network has the freedom to choose the locations of its nodes autonomously. Therefore, a self-deploying network with mobile base stations is able to adapt to changes in user distributions across the coverage area and user demand, resulting in an improved performance compared to conventional networks",
        "For cellular networks, a planning process is usually performed in a quasi-manual manner, using a mixture of centralised planning tools, expensive drive testing and economic rules-of-thumb. For other wireless networks, such as wireless local area networks (WLAN), no planning is performed at all, resulting in low performance and efficiency. Likewise, statically deployed networks with centralised control are unable to recover reliably from failing nodes. In this way, some significant drawbacks of network adaptation solutions are expense, time consumption and complicated cellular planning process.",
        "Use of a host of techniques, such as simulated annealing, evolutionary algorithms, integer linear programming, and greedy algorithms has been proposed to position wireless access nodes, e.g., base stations for network planning. Other approaches have explored the trade-offs between coverage, cell count and capacity. It has been shown that, the identification of the globally optimum base station locations in a network of multiple base stations is a NP-hard problem, far too complex to solve computationally. Further difficulties are that most of the system parameters required to find an optimal solution are unknown, and the optimal positions change constantly due to the changes in user demand, user positions, and base station positions.",
        "More specifically, the manual adaptation of the base station positions based on the optimal positions identified by the network relies on manual decision making and optimization. Such manual decision making and optimization may become exorbitantly expensive, essentially dominating the total network costs, particularly as the capital expenses continue to reduce over time through improvements in hardware and software. Even worse, a large-scale increase in the sheer complexity of a wireless access network deployment and configuration process may exceed the capabilities of manual planning and configuration entirely.",
        "The present invention is directed to overcoming, or at least reducing, the effects of, one or more of the problems set forth above.",
        "The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an exhaustive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is discussed later.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for adapting a communications network of a plurality of base stations to a changing environment. The method comprises determining the current locations of a plurality of users in the communications network connected to a first base station, identifying a need for change in at least one parameter associated with a position of the first base station of the plurality of base stations based on the current locations of the connected users, and implementing a first response in the communications network in response to the need for change for the first base station.",
        "In another embodiment, a wireless access node associated with a communications network comprises a controller capable of adapting the communications network to a changing environment and a storage coupled to the controller. The storage stores instructions to determine a current location of a plurality of users in the communications network, identify a need for change in at least one parameter associated with a position of the wireless access node based on the current location of the users, and implement a first response in the communications network in response to the need for change for the wireless access node.",

It should be understood, however, that the description herein of specific embodiments is not intended to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.",
        "Illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions may be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but may nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.",
        "Generally, a communications system and a method is provided for adapting a network of a plurality of wireless access nodes to a changing environment. For example, a wireless access network, i.e., self-deploying network uses self-configuration of one or more wireless access nodes, e.g., base stations to control overall network costs of providing a service to a user of a wireless communication device, such as a mobile unit. Specifically, one or more wireless access nodes may modify positions thereof without a human interaction to enable a wireless access network to adapt autonomously to changes in user locations and/or user demand. For wireless access node or base-station positioning in a wireless access network, an algorithm provides autonomous self-deployment and self-configuration, based on a changing environment of user locations and user demand (current values or statistics), in a distributed manner. A distributed algorithm provides distributed processing resulting in a self-organising manner to achieve a desired level of robustness and scalability. Indirect communication between the wireless access nodes, e.g., base stations performing self-deployment, enables a technology independent adaptation of the wireless access network. Accordingly, the wireless access network may comprise base stations capable of operating with different standards or protocols, such as UMTS or 802.11, complementing each other.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1, a communications system 100 is illustrated to include a plurality of wireless access nodes, e.g., base stations (BS) 105 (1-N) according to one illustrative embodiment of the present invention. For example, a first wireless access node or a first base station 105(1) may have at least one neighboring, e.g., a second wireless access node or a second base station 105(2). The first wireless access node or the first BS 105(1) may store a distributed algorithm 110 to adapt a wireless access communication network 115 to a changing environment for at least a first user associated with a first wireless communication device, e.g., a first mobile unit 120(1). The first wireless communication device or first mobile unit 120(1) may be capable of communicating with the plurality of wireless access nodes or the BSs 105 (1-N).",
        "One example of the wireless access communication network 115 is a self-deploying radio access network. Such a self-deploying radio access network may learn from a current performance, i.e., in terms of coverage and capacity and in terms of the network profitability. Accordingly, the wireless access communication network 115 may determine desired changes in positions, additions, and removals of one or more wireless access nodes or the BSs 105 (1-N) based on user demands, user locations and/or distribution of users in an environment that may change over time.",
        "Consistent with one embodiment, the distributed algorithm 110 may adapt the wireless access communication network 115 to the changing environment based on position data 122(1) and location data 122(2) and/or statistics 122(3) associated with the changing environment. By optimizing the first wireless access node or the first BS 105(1) based on position data 122(1) and location data 122(2) and/or statistics 122(3) associated with the changing environment, the distributed algorithm 110 may adapt the wireless access communication network 115 to the changing environment. That is, in one embodiment, each wireless access node or the BS 105 may use a corresponding distributed algorithm 110 to adapt the wireless access communication network 115 by all the wireless access nodes or the BSs 105 (1-N) in a distributed manner.",
        "In one embodiment, a changing environment behavior of the wireless access communication network 115 may be collected as the position data 122(1) associated with positioning and re-positioning of the wireless access nodes or the BSs 105 (1-N) and the location data 122(2) associated with current locations of users of the plurality wireless communication device, e.g., mobile units 120(1-m). Additionally, the statistics 122(3) may be collected as one or more user statistics at each wireless access node or base station 105 during operation thereof.",
        "For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, the position data 122(1) may comprise coordinates data for a particular position of at least a first wireless access node or the BS 105 (1) within a coverage area of the wireless access communication network 115. Likewise, the location data 122(2) may comprise current location data of the first user associated with the first wireless communication device or the first mobile unit 120(1). The statistics 122(3) may comprise, for example, demand for use from users for the wireless access communication network 115 over a period of time, such as requests for particular data rates.",
        "The wireless access communication network 115 may comprise a conventional radio access network 126, e.g., a Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) and a conventional core network (CN) 128. The wireless access communication network 115 may further comprise a first and a second radio network controller (RNC) 130(1), 130(k) to manage communications with the plurality of wireless communication devices or the mobile units 120(1-m) according to one illustrative embodiment of the present invention.",
        "Each of the first and second RNCs 130(1), 130(k) may be associated with one or more wireless access nodes or the BSs 105(1-N), such as Node-Bs within the wireless access communication network 115. Specifically, the first RNC 130 (1) may be coupled to a first plurality of wireless access nodes or base stations, i.e., Node-Bs including the first wireless access node or the first BS 105(1) and a second wireless access node or a second BS 105(2). Likewise, the second RNC 130(k) may be coupled to a second plurality of wireless access nodes or base stations, i.e., Node-Bs 105(3-N).",
        "The first wireless access node or the first BS 105(1) may comprise a controller 135 capable of adapting the wireless access communication network 115 to the changing environment, in one embodiment. The first wireless access node or the first BS 105(1) may further comprise a storage 140 coupled to the controller 135. The storage 140 may store instructions, i.e., the distributed algorithm 110 to determine a current location of a plurality of users in the wireless access communication network 115. The distributed algorithm 110 may identify a need for change in at least one parameter associated with a position of the first wireless access node or the first BS 105(1) based on the current location of the users. In response to the need for change for first wireless access node or the first BS 105(1), the distributed algorithm 110 may implement a first response in the wireless access communication network 115.",
        "Using the distributed algorithm 110 at each wireless access node or the BS 105(1-N), the wireless access communication network 115 may autonomously identify a need for change in at least one parameter associated with at least one of a number, position and configuration of a wireless access node or base station 105, based on user demand and user locations, adapting the wireless access communication network 115 to the changing environment. By using the distributed algorithm 110, the wireless access communication network 115 may obtain a near-optimum solution for self-deployment and self-configuration, based only on limited locally available system knowledge. While the self-deployment may refer to adapting to changes in a wireless or mobile communication environment involving the users of the plurality wireless communication device or mobile units 120(1-m) and the wireless access nodes or base stations 105(1-N) within the wireless access communication network 115 over a relatively long term, such as weeks to years, the self-configuration may refer to the adaptation for a relatively short-term activity over tens of minutes to days, as examples.",
        "In one embodiment, a short term self-deployment is possible, for example, in a military environment, where the wireless access nodes or base stations 105(1-N) may be mobile (e.g., flying drones, or autonomous vehicles). For this case, the current mobile unit 120 locations may be taken into account instead of collected statistics 122(3) by the distributed algorithms 110.",
        "Instead of optimizing the wireless access node or base station 105 positions according to cell coverage or cell capacity, the distributed algorithm 110 may optimize the wireless access node or base station 105 positions based on the changing environment, such as the current, and constantly changing, wireless communication device or mobile unit connections 145(1-m), user demand, and user locations and/or wireless access node or base station 105 positions. In the communications system 100, the wireless access node or base station 105 positions may be visible and/or dependent on wireless communication device or mobile unit 120 locations. When the current mobile unit 120 locations and/or requests of data rates from users change, one or more of the wireless access nodes or base stations 105(1-N) may move to a new position. In this manner, the distributed algorithm 110 may optimize the wireless access node or base station 105 positions without utilizing knowledge of noise and interference.",
        "One example of the wireless access communication network 115 includes a digital cellular network, such as defined at least in part by the UMTS, GSM, WCDMA or CDMA standards. More specifically, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specifications may define interactions between the plurality of wireless communication devices, e.g., mobile units 120(1-m) and the first and second plurality of the wireless access nodes or base stations, i.e., Node-Bs 105(1-N) within the communications system 100, such as a based on a CDMA technique. The wireless communication device or the mobile unit 120 may refer to a host of wireless communication devices including, but not limited to, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and global positioning systems (GPS) that employ the communications system 100 to operate in the wireless access communication network 115, such as a third or fourth generation digital cellular CDMA or WCDMA network.",
        "In one embodiment, the distributed algorithm 110 may be used with the changing environment based on user distribution and demand maps. For example, a network operator may obtain the user distribution and demand maps from a service broker agent. In another embodiment, such optimization may be used to determine an optimum radiation pattern for each wireless access node or base station 105 instead of, or complementary with the wireless access node or base station 105 positioning. Since a radiation pattern of a wireless access node or base station 105 influences a desired transmit power in a manner similar to the wireless access node or base station 105 position, the radiation pattern may be optimized. In this case, for each wireless access node or base station 105 a globally or locally optimal or near optimal radiation pattern may be identified in the wireless access communication network 115.",
        "Turning now to FIG. 2, self-deployment of the wireless access communication network 115 illustrated in FIG. 1 is schematically depicted based on self-organization using indirect communication between the plurality of wireless access nodes or base stations 105(1-N) and local optimization of each wireless access node or base station 105 in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the instant invention. An example of a self-organisation process, resulting from such indirect communication between wireless access nodes or base stations 105 and local optimization of each wireless access node or base station 105 location is illustrated in FIG. 2. The first and second wireless access nodes or base stations BS1, BS2 are shown as solid squares 105(1-2) and the wireless communication devices or mobile units 120 are shown as ellipses with a line to the connected wireless access node or base station 105. The optimal base station positions are shown as dotted squares 105a(1) and 105a(2).",
        "By using the indirect communication, each wireless access nodes or base stations 105 may modify its surrounding environment as a first response to the need for change determined by the distributed algorithm 110, and these changes then influence the behaviour of neighbouring wireless access nodes or base stations 105 as a second response. In the wireless access communication network 115, for example, interactions known as stigmergy may be used to coordinate activities of the wireless access nodes or base stations 105(1-N) by means of self-organization.",
        "In a wireless communication, the environment in the wireless access communication network 115 may relate to the link connections 145(1-m) to the wireless communication devices or mobile units 120(1-m). When one or more of the wireless communication devices or mobile units 120(1-m) connect to a particular wireless access node or base station 105 with a strongest received pilot power, the link connections 145(1-m) may provide information on the coverage of neighbouring cells associated with neighbouring wireless access nodes or base stations 105.",
        "To adapt to a change in the network environment, the distributed algorithm 110 may perform local optimization of the wireless access node or base station 105 positions. Other optimization possibilities include, for example, modifications of the pilot powers to achieve load balancing (e.g., either equal transmit power, or equal capacity) in each cell. The indirect communication through modification of the network environment may allow interoperability of heterogeneous systems (i.e., systems with different access technologies) since the first wireless access node or base station 105(1) may not directly exchange data with the second wireless access node or base station 105(2) in the wireless access communication network 115.",
        "In a start condition, as step 1, the wireless communication devices or mobile units 120 are connected to either the first wireless access node or base station 105(1) or the second wireless access node or base station 105(2) based on a connection rule (e.g., strongest received pilot power). This scenario defines the current network environment in one embodiment. In each step, the distributed algorithm 110 calculates the optimal positions for wireless access nodes or base stations 105 based on the current network environment. At step 2, the first and second wireless access nodes or base stations 105(1-2) may move to the predicted optimum positions, as shown by the dotted squares 105a(1) and 105a(2). The new base station positions 105a(1) and 105a(2) may trigger a change in the link connection 145(1-m) to the wireless communication devices or mobile units 120(1-m). This modification of the network environment provides an indirect way of communication between the wireless access nodes or base stations 105, e.g., providing information on coverage, positions, and the like.",
        "Referring to FIG. 3, re-positioning of the first and second wireless access nodes or base stations 105(1-2) shown in FIG. 2 is schematically depicted consistent with one embodiment of the present invention. That is, a further example showing the self-deployment process triggered by load balancing via modification of the pilot powers is shown in FIG. 3. A set of contour plots 310(1) illustrate the received pilot power.",
        "Besides the optimization of the resource efficiency, the optimal positions 105a(1) and 105a(2) of the first and second wireless access nodes or base stations 105(1-2), respectfully, may depend on a variety of factors or constrains, such as suitable locations, costs, or legislations may play a role for the positioning. For example, the optimal positions 105a(1) and 105a(2) may depend upon use of resources (i.e. transmit power and available frequency spectrum), within constrains such as maximum transmit power levels of single base stations or possible locations.",
        "Accordingly, consistent with one embodiment, rules for optimal positioning of individual wireless access nodes or base stations, and wireless access nodes or base stations 105 in the wireless access communication network 115 may be stated as follows: (1). a local optimization of individual wireless access nodes or base stations may provide an optimal position for an individual wireless access node or base station that enables sustaining all requested connections with a given minimum possible transmit power criteria and (2). a global optimization of wireless access nodes or base stations 115 in the wireless access communication network 115 may provide the optimal positions of all the wireless access communication network 115 in a network, enabling the network to sustain all requested connections with a given minimum possible transmit power criteria. In addition, both rules may be subject to desired constraints. Of course, a locally optimum position of a single base station of Rule 1 may not necessarily be equivalent to a position of the same base station in a globally optimized network based on Rule 2.",
        "As shown, FIG. 4 illustrates a stylized representation of a flow chart implementing a method for adapting the wireless access communication network 115, illustrated in FIG. 1, of the plurality of wireless access nodes or base stations 105(1-N) shown in FIG. 2 to a changing environment consistent with one embodiment of the present invention. At block 400, the distributed algorithm 110 stored in the storage 140 may be executed by the controller 135 at the wireless access node or base stations 105(1) to determine a current location of at least one first user in a communications network, i.e., the wireless access communication network 115 of the plurality of wireless access nodes or base stations 105(1-N).",
        "The distributed algorithm 110 may identify a need for change in at least one parameter associated with a position of the first wireless access node or the first BS 105(1) based on the current location of the users, as indicated in block 405. A decision block 410 may ascertain whether a need for change in the current position of the first wireless access node or the first BS 105(1) exists. If so, at block 415, the distributed algorithm 110 may implement a first response in the wireless access communication network 115 by moving or re-positioning the first wireless access node or the first BS 105(1) to a new position, such as an optimal position. In this way, the distributed algorithm 110 may adapt the wireless access communication network 115 to a changing environment, as shown in block 420, according to some embodiments of the instant invention.",
        "Consistent with one embodiment of the present invention, in FIG. 5, an optimization process for the first and second BSs 105(1-2) shown in FIG. 2 is illustrated based on the position data 122(1) and the location data 122(2) and/or statistics 122(3) associated with the changing environment to adapt the wireless access communication network 115 illustrated in FIG. 1. Using the distributed algorithm 110, at the first and second BSs 105(1-2), the wireless access communication network 115 may determine base station coordinates for the current positions thereof, at block 500. Likewise, coordinates for the wireless communication devices or mobile units 120 of interest that may depend upon a particular application or service, for example, may be determined at block 505 to obtain the current locations of the associated users.",

        "When the plurality of wireless access nodes or base stations 105(1-N) are self-deploying, the distributed algorithm 110 may improve the deployment convergence speed by using the knowledge that for certain changes in a position of a wireless access node or base station, other wireless access nodes or base stations will react to those changes and take over users connected at an old position. Such self-deploying may result in a further movement of a desired wireless access node or base station in a next deployment step. This further movement may be taken into account in the current deployment step by moving further in the same direction, than the current optimum position indicates. Given that p={x, y} is a vector comprising the coordinates of the current position, and popt, the vector of the calculated optimum position, the new position pnew for improved convergence may be calculated as\n\npnew=popt+\u03b1(popt\u2212p), \u2003\u2003(8)\n\nwhere the path extension factor \u03b1 is bounded in the interval 0\u2266\u03b1\u22661 to achieve stability.

In a scenario where a path loss dominates the total channel loss, optimising a base station 105 position for the currently connected mobile units 120 may result in efficient self-deployment characteristics, since connection changes happen only at the edges of a cell. For scenarios where shadow fading dominates the channel loss for a single base station, the connections to the mobile units 120 may change dramatically when the base station 105 position changes. Therefore, optimizing the position for the currently connected mobiles may not be efficient in channels dominated by shadow fading.",

These mobile units 120 may form a new network environment for each base station 105, on which the self-deploying distributed algorithms 110 base associated positioning calculation. The mobile units 120 with the highest connection probability may be determined by a cell selection method (e.g., a mobile unit 120 connects to a base station with the strongest calculated received pilot power), while ignoring the shadow fading contribution in the calculation.

It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.",
        "It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise, or as is apparent from the discussion, terms such as \u201cprocessing\u201d or \u201ccomputing\u201d or \u201ccalculating\u201d or \u201cdetermining\u201d or \u201cdisplaying\u201d or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical, electronic quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.",
        "Note also that the software implemented aspects of the invention are typically encoded on some form of program storage medium or implemented over some type of transmission medium. The program storage medium may be magnetic (e.g., a floppy disk or a hard drive) or optical (e.g., a compact disk read only memory, or \u201cCD ROM\u201d), and may be read only or random access. Similarly, the transmission medium may be twisted wire pairs, coaxial cable, optical fiber, or some other suitable transmission medium known to the art. The invention is not limited by these aspects of any given implementation.",
