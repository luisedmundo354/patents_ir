        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device; more specifically, a method of forming patterns in semiconductor device.",
        "2. Description of Related Art",
        "Generally, semiconductor memory devices comprise a volatile memory device and a non-volatile memory device. The volatile memory devices comprise a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device and a static random access memory device (SRAM). The non-volatile memory devices comprise an erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM) and an electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM).",
        "The volatile memory device usually has one transistor and one capacitor. Thus, for example, a 16M-DRAM device has about 16,000,000 transistors and about 16,000,000 capacitors per unit chip. A capacitor of the DRAM device includes a storage node, a cell plate, and a dielectric layer.",
        "The non-volatile memory device has a vertically stacked (multi-layered) gate structure including a floating gate formed on a semiconductor substrate. The vertically stacked gate structure of the non-volatile memory device typically comprises at least one tunnel oxide film or at least one interlayer dielectrics (ILD), and a control gate formed over the floating gate or near the floating gate.",
        "Recently, widths of wirings and distances between the wirings have been greatly reduced, and minute and more intricate patterns are warranted as the volatile and non-volatile memory devices became more highly integrated. To form the minute patterns, minute photoresist patterns needed to be formed using an anti-reflective layer (ARL) because the ARL minimizes interference that may be caused by underlying films. Generally, conductive patterns of the memory device have been formed using minute photoresist patterns.",
        "Methods for forming patterns of a volatile memory device or a non-volatile memory device using an anti-reflective layer are disclosed in Korean Patent Laid Open Publication No. 2002-34772, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,174,816 and 6,380,611 (issued to Zhiping Yin et. al.), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,948,703 (issued to Lewis Shen et. al.).",
        "FIGS. 1A to 1C are cross-sectional views illustrating a conventional method of forming patterns of a semiconductor device.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 1C, after an insulation film 15 mainly including oxide is formed on a semiconductor substrate 10, a conductive film 20 including polysilicon, metal or metal compound is formed on the insulation film 15.",
        "An anti-reflective layer (ARL) 25 is formed on the conductive film 20. The ARL 25 includes silicon oxide, silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride.",
        "After a photoresist film (not shown) is formed on the ARL 25, the photoresist film is patterned to form photoresist patterns 30 for the formation of conductive patterns 35 using a photo process.",
        "The ARL 25 is etched using the photoresist pattern 30 as an etching mask to form an ARL pattern 40. The conductive film 20 is successively etched to form the conductive patterns 35 on the insulation film 15.",
        "The photoresist patterns 30 and the ARL pattern 40 are removed from the conductive patterns 35, thereby completing the conductive pattern 35. The conductive patterns 35 serve as a bit line or a word line of a semiconductor device.",
        "However, in the above-described method of forming the pattern, oxide residues are generated from a purge gas containing nitrogen oxide that is used during a purge process for forming the ARL. Because the oxide residues may not be completely removed from the ARL through a pre-treating process of forming the photoresist pattern, the photoresist patterns may be lifted from the ARL or the photoresist patterns may cling to each other. Thus, the conductive patterns may be lifted or connected to each other in accordance with the lifted or clung photoresist patterns. The conductive patterns lifted or connected cause failures in the semiconductor device. This problem will be more apparent by viewing FIGS. 2A, 2B and 3.",
        "FIGS. 2A and 2B are cross-sectional views of a conventional method for forming patterns in semiconductor device. FIG. 3 is an electron microscopic picture showing conductive patterns formed according to the conventional method.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2A, a purge gas generally including nitrogen oxide is introduced to purge the ARL 25 during a formation of the ARL 25. Then, oxide residues 45 are generated on the ARL 25 due to the purge gas. When the photoresist patterns 30 are formed on the ARL 25 on which the oxide residues 45 exist, an adhesion strength between the photoresist pattern 30 and the ARL 25 may be reduced. As a result, the photoresist patterns 30 may be lifted from the ARL 30 or adjacent photoresist patterns 30 may cling to each other.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 2B and 3, the conductive patterns 35 are formed by etching the conductive film 20 using the lifted or clung photoresist patterns 30 as an etching mask. The conductive patterns 35 may not have desired shapes and dimensions because the conductive patterns 35 may not be formed or adjacent conductive patterns 35 may cling to each other. These conductive patterns 35 cause the failure of the semiconductor device, and manufacturing yield is reduced.",
        "A need therefore exists to provide a method of forming patterns in semiconductor device that prevents the lifting and clinging of conductive patterns.",
        "According to one embodiment of the invention, a method of forming patterns in a semiconductor device comprises: forming a conductive film on a substrate; forming an anti-reflective layer on the conductive film; cleaning oxide residues on the anti-reflective layer using a first cleaning solution; cleaning the oxide residues on the anti-reflective layer using a second cleaning solution; forming a photoresist pattern on the anti-reflective layer; and patterning the conductive film using the photoresist pattern.",
        "Preferably, cleaning oxide residues on the anti-reflective layer using a first cleaning solution including sulfuric acid is performed at a temperature of about 70\u00b0 C. for about 3 to about 10 minutes. Cleaning the oxide residues on the anti-reflective layer using a second cleaning solution including SC 1 is performed at a temperature of about 30 to about 70\u00b0 C. for about 5 to about 15 minutes.",
        "According to another embodiment of the invention, a method of forming patterns in a semiconductor device comprises: forming an insulation film on a substrate; forming a conductive film on the insulation film; forming a hard mask layer on the conductive film; cleaning oxide residues on the hard mask layer using a first cleaning solution; cleaning the oxide residues on the hard mask layer using a second cleaning solution; forming a photoresist pattern on the hard mask layer; forming a hard mask by patterning the hard mask layer using the photoresist pattern; and patterning the conductive film using the hard mask.",

The insulation film 105 includes an interlayer dielectric (ILD) (not shown) that is interposed between metal wirings of a semiconductor device. Additionally, the insulation film 105 includes an oxide film of a transistor (not shown) formed on the semiconductor substrate 100.",
        "After a conductive film 110 is formed on the insulation film 105, an anti-reflective layer (ARL) 115 is formed on the conductive film 110. The conductive film 110 will be patterned to form wiring patterns, electrode patterns or pad patterns in a semiconductor device. The conductive film 110 includes polysilicon, doped polysilicon, metal or metal silicide. The metal includes tungsten (W), aluminum (Al) or cobalt (Co). The metal silicide includes tungsten silicide (WSix) or cobalt silicide (CoSix). The ARL 115 includes silicon nitride, silicon oxide or silicon oxynitride.",
        "To form a photoresist film (not shown) on the ARL 115, the semiconductor oxide residues from the hard mask layer using the second cleaning solution including SC substrate 100 having the ARL 115 formed thereon is purged in-situ using a purge gas containing nitrogen oxide such as nitrous oxide (N2O). As a result, oxide residues 120 are generated from the purge gas including nitrogen oxide, and the oxide residues 120 are formed on the ARL 115.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4B, the oxide residues 120 (shown in FIG. 4A) are removed from the ARL 115 using a first cleaning process and a second cleaning process. After the oxide residues 120 are removed from the ARL 115, a photoresist film (not shown) is formed on the ARL 115. The photoresist film is patterned to form photoresist patterns 125. The photoresist patterns 125 are stably formed on the ARL 115 because there are no oxide residues on the ARL 115.",
        "In the first cleaning process, the oxide residues 120 are cleaned using a first cleaning solution at a low temperature of about 30 to about 70\u00b0 C. for about 3 to about 10 minutes. Preferably, the first cleaning process is performed at a low temperature of about 50\u00b0 C. for about 5 minutes.",
        "The first cleaning solution preferably includes sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Then, the oxide residues 120 are removed from the ARL 115 using a second cleaning process. In the second cleaning process, the oxide residues 120 are completely removed from the ARL 115 using a second cleaning solution at a low temperature of about 30 to about 70\u00b0 C. for about 5 to about 15 minutes. Preferably, the second cleaning process is performed at a low temperature of about 50\u00b0 C. for about 10 minutes. The second cleaning solution includes standard cleaning solution 1 (referred to as SC 1) that includes ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and deionized water (H2O) by a volume ratio of about 1:1:5. The first and second cleaning processes are performed in-situ. Compositions of the first and second cleaning solutions can be varied in accordance with a composition of the ARL 115 or the purge gas. Alternatively, the first cleaning solution may have an identical or similar composition to the second cleaning solution.",
        "In the conventional method of forming a pattern of a semiconductor device, oxide residues formed on an anti-reflective layer may not be removed because a pre-treating process for forming a photoresist pattern is merely performed for about 5 minutes. The remaining oxide residues may reduce a structural stability of the photoresist patterns formed thereon, thereby causing a lifting of the photoresist patterns or a clinging of the photoresist patterns. In the present invention, primary and secondary cleaning processes are performed in-situ to completely remove the oxide residues 120 on the ARL 115. Thus, photoresist patterns can be stably formed on the ARL 115. Therefore, conductive patterns having desired dimensions can be formed by the photoresist patterns that have improved structural stabilities because the lifting or the clinging of the photoresist patterns can be effectively prevented.",
