    "abstract": "A mechanism for ensuring the physical location of data processing devices as a security check is provided. With this mechanism, security data is transmitted to data processing devices via an electrical network and is used to perform a security check to determine if the data processing device may operate. The data processing devices may be limited such that they may only power-up, boot-up, or remain operational when they are coupled to the electrical network. Thus, they must be physically located such that they may gain access to the electrical network. In addition, a security check may be used to control which data processing devices may communicate data packets with one another over the data network. When a data packet is received by a data processing device, security data in the data packet is compared against a local history of security data received by the recipient of the data packet via the electrical network. If matching security data is found in the history for the same time represented by an associated timestamp, then the sending data processing device and the receiving data processing device are determined to be present on the same electrical network and may communicate with one another.",

        "1. Technical Field",
        "The present invention is directed to an improved authentication mechanism for data processing devices. More specifically, the present invention is directed to an apparatus and method for location specific authentication of data processing devices using powerline networking.",
        "2. Description of Related Art",
        "Physical location is one of the harder aspects of computer security to ensure and verify. It is often quite desirable to restrict access to a data network to computing devices that are physically situated within the confines of a particular company, government agency, or other entity's physical location. For example, a company, government agency, or the like may wish to allow users to access a data network only when they are using a computer that is present within the building in which the company, government agency, or the like operates. This may ensure that the users of such computing devices are authorized employees of the company, agency or the like through the use of other security measures present in the building, e.g., ID cards, security guards, passcodes, and the like.",
        "There currently is no adequate security mechanism for ensuring and verifying the physical location of computing devices. The known security mechanism for controlling access to data networks, or even access to computing devices themselves, are based on password, user identifiers, digital certificates, digital signatures, and the like. These mechanisms cannot by themselves be used to verify the physical location of computing devices.",
        "Recently, the ability to transmit data over powerlines has been developed as a possible networking alternative. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,554,968 to Lee, entitled \u201cData Communication Using Power Lines,\u201d issued Sep. 10, 1996, describes a mechanism in which message signals may be superimposed on an AC power signal. The message signals include a header that identifies the sending device and the intended recipient device. In this way, only the intended receiving network is able to trap the message signal.",
        "In addition, a Canadian company by the name of Cogency has developed a system in which powerline integrated circuits make use of existing in-home AC electrical wires for transmitting digital data at high speeds. The Cogency approach to providing data communication over AC electrical wires is described, for example, in the white papers \u201cData Communications over Power Lines\u201d and \u201cHome Networking Over Power Lines,\u201d available from www.cogency.com.",
        "Even though data transmissions over electrical power lines is generally known, there are no current mechanisms for using these data transmissions over electrical wires as a means for ensuring the physical location of computing devices. In other words, there are no known mechanisms for controlling access to data networks and computing devices based on the data that is transmitted over electrical power lines.",
        "Thus, it would be beneficial to have an apparatus and method for using the site specific nature of an electrical network as a means for ensuring physical location of data processing devices. Moreover, it would be beneficial to have an apparatus and method that uses security data transmitted over electrical powerlines as a means for determining whether data processing devices may operate or continue to operate as part of a data network.",
        "The present invention provides a mechanism for ensuring the physical location of data processing devices as a security check. With the mechanism of the present invention, security data is transmitted to data processing devices via an electrical network. The security information is provided to the data processing devices via a data network such that the data processing devices may utilized this security information in authenticating the data processing devices using the security data received via the electrical network. The data processing devices may be limited such that they may only power-up, boot-up, or remain operational when they are coupled to the electrical network. Thus, they must be physically located such that they may gain access to the electrical network. For example, they must be present within the building in which the electrical network is situated.",
        "In addition, the security check of the present invention may be used to control which data processing devices may communicate data packets with one another of the data network. For example, a data packet may include security data and a timestamp, the security data being data obtained via an electrical network. When the data packet is received by another data processing device, the security data is compared against a local history of security data received by the recipient of the data packet via the electrical network. If matching security data is found in the history for the same time represented by the timestamp, then the sending data processing device and the receiving data processing device are determined to be present on the same electrical network and may communicate with one another.",
        "Thus, with the present invention, theft of equipment from a site or location is deterred since the equipment will not be allowed to operate when not in the presence of the data signal that is transmitted over the electrical network of the site or location. In addition, the present invention deters outside data processing devices from sending data packets to data processing devices associated with a site or location since those data packets will not be processed because the sending data processing device does not have access to the data signal being sent over the electrical network of the site or location.",
        "These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be described in, or will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of, the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.",
        "The novel features believed characteristic of the invention are set forth in the appended claims. The invention itself, however, as well as a preferred mode of use, further objectives and advantages thereof, will best be understood by reference to the following detailed description of an illustrative embodiment when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:",
        "FIG. 1 is an exemplary diagram of a network of data processing devices coupled to an electrical network in which the present invention may be implemented;",

        "FIG. 10 is a flowchart outlining an exemplary operation of one exemplary embodiment of the present invention with regard to determining whether data packets received from another device are to be processed or not.",
        "With reference now to the figures, FIG. 1 is an exemplary diagram of a network of data processing devices coupled to an electrical network in which the present invention may be implemented. The system of the present invention, as illustrated in FIG. 1, is a combination of a site-specific data network and electrical network (the combination of the data network and the electrical network is referred collectively herein as a \u201csite-specific network\u201d). The site-specific data network may be coupled to other networks, such as other wide area networks, local area networks, the Internet, or the like, via known server mechanisms. The site-specific electrical network is coupled to an external power network, such as a power grid, via known electrical connections.",
        "The present invention provides an improvement to the supply of power over the site-specific power network, and an improvement to the authentication of data processing devices on the data network, by providing for data transmission over the site-specific power network as a mechanism for ensuring network access to site-located data processing devices. In order to explain the operation of the present invention, it is first necessary to provide a brief explanation of the data network of the present invention followed by an explanation of how the data network and the electrical network work together to achieve the objectives of the present invention.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 1, the present invention includes a network of data processing devices/systems. Network data processing system 100 is a network of computers in which the present invention may be implemented. Network data processing system 100 contains a network 102, which is the medium used to provide communications links between various devices and computers connected together within network data processing system 100. Network 102 may include connections, such as wire, wireless communication links, or fiber optic cables.",
        "In the depicted example, server 104 is connected to network 102 along with storage unit 106. In addition, clients 108, 110, and 112 are connected to network 102. These clients 108, 110, and 112 may be, for example, personal computers or network computers. In the depicted example, server 104 provides data, such as boot files, operating system images, and applications to clients 108-112. Clients 108, 110, and 112 are clients to server 104. Network data processing system 100 may include additional servers, clients, and other data processing devices not shown.",
        "In the depicted example, network data processing system 100 is a local area network with network 102 being a site-specific collection of networks and gateways that use a suite of protocols to communicate with one another. Of course, network data processing system 100 also may be implemented as a number of different types of networks, such as for example, the Internet, an intranet, a wide area network (WAN), or the like. FIG. 1 is intended as an example, and not as an architectural limitation for the present invention.",
        "By \u201csite-specific,\u201d what is meant is that the collection of data processing devices, networks, and gateways, are all associated with the same location. This location may be, for example, a geographical location, a place of business, a particular physical building or man-made structure, a hierarchical division of an organization, such as a department within a company or government agency, or the like.",
        "Thus, for example, a single company or government agency, may have a plurality of departments all located within the same physical building. The data processing devices of all of the departments, their network connections, and the like, as a whole may be considered a single site-specific network. Alternatively, each individual department may have their own subgroup of data processing devices, network connections, and the like, that define their own individual site-specific network.",
        "The \u201csite-specific\u201d nature of the group of data processing devices, network connections, and the like, is defined by the electrical connections between these devices. That is, data processing devices coupled to the same electrical network may be defined to be part of the same \u201csite-specific\u201d network even though they may communicate with other data processing devices on the same electrical network over a distributed data network that is not limited in location.",
        "Additionally the \u201csite-specific\u201d network can also span multiple physical locations if the individual locations have a means of injecting the same data signal into the AC electrical signal received from an outside source. For example, if the electrical networks of two distinct locations are constructed to provide identical security information over the electrical connections, then the two physical sites constitute one single \u201csite-specific\u201d network within the meaning of the term as it is used in the present description.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 1, the server 104, storage device 106, clients 108-112, and the like, are all coupled to an electrical network 120 via electrical power connections 130. For example, the data processing devices 104, 106, and 108-112 may be coupled to the electrical network by way of electrical plugs and wall mounted outlets in a physical building or man-made structure. The electrical network 120 receives power from an external power network 150, e.g., a power grid, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and power conditioning equipment 160.",
        "The power supplied by the external network 150 is an alternating current (AC) power signal that is received by the UPS and power conditioning equipment 160. The UPS and power conditioning equipment 160 performs functions in accordance with the present invention to use the AC electrical power signal as a carrier wave for data communication over the electrical network 120. In order to modulate data onto the AC electrical power signal, the UPS and power conditioning equipment 160 may make use of the Homeplug\u2122 powerline technology available from Cogency. The Homeplug\u2122 powerline technology is described, for example, in \u201cData Communications over Power Lines\u201d and \u201cHome Networking over Power Lines,\u201d both white papers available from Cogency at www.cogency.com, and hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "The data modulated onto the AC electrical power signal carrier wave is a site-specific data signal that is introduced into the AC electrical power signal after it is received from the external power network 150 but prior to the AC power signal being provided to the wall mounted outlets to which the data processing devices are plugged in. Thus, only the data processing devices that are coupled to the electrical network 120 are capable of receiving the modified AC power signal having the data signal modulated thereon.",
        "The particular data signal that is generated and added to the AC power signal may be generated based on security information received from, for example, a server 104 of the site-specific network. Alternativley, the UPS and power conditioning equipment 160 may be provided with the necessary hardware/software to determine the appropriate security information upon which the data signal is generated. In either case, the security information must be available to both the UPS and power conditioning equipment 160 and the data processing devices 104, 106, 108, 110 and 112 of the site-specific network.",
        "This security information may include, for example, a digital signature, a digital certificate, public key/private key encryption information, a randomly generated string of alphanumeric characters, or other security mechanism generally known in the art. The server 104 or UPS and power conditioning equipment 160 may generate this security information on a periodic or continual basis. This security information is provided to both the UPS and power conditioning equipment 160 and the data processing devices of the site-specific network.",
        "The data processing devices may operate in a number of security modes based on the data received via the electrical network 120. In a first mode, the data processing devices perform a security check against the data received via the electrical network 120 to determine if the data processing device is permitted to power-up or boot. In this mode of operation, data processing devices are not permitted to power-up or boot if they are not in the presence of the appropriate AC power signal having the correct security information data. In this way, theft of equipment from a site or location may be deterred since the equipment will not power-up or boot unless the equipment is physically located such that it may receive power from the electrical network 120.",
        "This check may further be performed on a periodic basis in order to allow continued use of the equipment. In this way, a user may not power-up or boot the data processing device and then transport it to another location to continue use of the data processing device.",
        "In a second mode, the data processing devices perform a security check based on the data received over the electrical network 120 to determine if data packets received from a computing device are from another device on the same electrical network 120, i.e. at the same site or same location. In such a mode of operation, the security information data that is present in the electrical power signals on the electrical network 120 may be continuously modified based on a non-predictable stream of data, such as a rolling random number, a keyed hash function, or the like. The data processing devices may maintain a history over a predetermined period of time of the security information that has been received over the electrical network.",
        "When a first data processing device wishes to send data to a second data processing device, the first data processing device may add an encrypted version of the security information data and a time stamp for when this security information data was received that was last received to the data packets being sent (encryption of this security information data is preferred, but is optional and is not necessary to the operation of the present invention). The second data processing device may decrypt this security information data and compare it to its own history to determine if there is a matching entry for the indicated time stamp. If there is a matching entry, then the two data processing devices must be on the same electrical network 120 and thus, must be present at the same site or location. As a result, the second data processing device may then be permitted to process data packets sent from the first data processing device.",
        "The histories maintained by the data processing devices may be limited in length such that only a short amount of time may be represented in the histories. For example, the history length may be limited to an average period of time in which it takes for a first data processing device to transmit a data packet to another data processing device. In this way, a person may not remove the data processing device from the electrical network 120 and later use old security information data and timestamps to communicate with data processing devices still attached to the electrical network 120.",
        "In a third mode of operation, the data processing devices operate in a combination approach using both the first and section modes of operation. That is, first security information data may be added to the AC electrical signal being sent over the electrical network 120 for use in determining whether a data processing device is able to continue a power-up or boot process. Second security information data, such as a continuously changing security information data stream, may be added to the AC electrical signal for use in determining if two or more data processing devices may transmit and process data packets to and from each other.",
        "Thus, the present invention provides security mechanisms for ensuring and verifying the physical location of data processing devices by way of electrical networks. With the present invention, theft of equipment and the use of equipment from an outside location to attempt to infiltrate a site-specific network is deterred and reduced.",
        "As mentioned above, the security information that is used to generate the data or data stream that is modulated onto the electrical signal sent over the electrical network 120 may be provided by a server, such as server 104. The server 104 may include a security module, such as security software, for implementing security procedures, generating and managing security information, and the like. Such security software is generally known in the art but has not been applied to a mechanism for ensuring and verifying the physical location of data processing devices in the manner of the present invention. FIG. 2 is an exemplary diagram of a server computing device in which such security mechanisms may be implemented.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2, a block diagram of a data processing system that may be implemented as a server, such as server 104 in FIG. 1, is depicted in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Data processing system 200 may be a symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) system including a plurality of processors 202 and 204 connected to system bus 206. Alternatively, a single processor system may be employed. Also connected to system bus 206 is memory controller/cache 208, which provides an interface to local memory 209. I/O bus bridge 210 is connected to system bus 206 and provides an interface to I/O bus 212. Memory controller/cache 208 and I/O bus bridge 210 may be integrated as depicted.",
        "Peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus bridge 214 connected to I/O bus 212 provides an interface to PCI local bus 216. A number of modems may be connected to PCI local bus 216. Typical PCI bus implementations will support four PCI expansion slots or add-in connectors. Communications links to clients 108-112 in FIG. 1 may be provided through modem 218 and network adapter 220 connected to PCI local bus 216 through add-in boards.",
        "Additional PCI bus bridges 222 and 224 provide interfaces for additional PCI local buses 226 and 228, from which additional modems or network adapters may be supported. In this manner, data processing system 200 allows connections to multiple network computers. A memory-mapped graphics adapter 230 and hard disk 232 may also be connected to I/O bus 212 as depicted, either directly or indirectly.",
        "Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the hardware depicted in FIG. 2 may vary. For example, other peripheral devices, such as optical disk drives and the like, may also be used in addition to or in place of the hardware depicted. The depicted example is not meant to imply architectural limitations with respect to the present invention. The data processing system depicted in FIG. 2 may be, for example, an IBM eServer pSeries system, a product of International Business Machines Corporation in Armonk, N.Y., running the Advanced Interactive Executive (AIX) operating system or LINUX operating system.",
        "The server apparatus illustrated in FIG. 2 may be provided with security software used to generate security information that is used as a basis for generating data or a data stream that is added to an electrical signal on the electrical network 120. This security information may further be provided to the data processing devices via the data network 102 so that they may use it for verification and authentication purposes.",
        "Since the data processing devices receive data from the server 104, they are clients of the server 104. These client devices may take many forms including workstations, personal computers, peripheral devices such as printers, scanners, and the like, portable computing devices, etc. An example of a client device that may be a personal computer or workstation is provided in FIG. 3.",
        "With reference now to FIG. 3, a block diagram illustrating a data processing system is depicted in which the present invention may be implemented. Data processing system 300 is an example of a client computer. Data processing system 300 employs a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) local bus architecture. Although the depicted example employs a PCI bus, other bus architectures such as Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) and Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) may be used. Processor 302 and main memory 304 are connected to PCI local bus 306 through PCI bridge 308. PCI bridge 308 also may include an integrated memory controller and cache memory for processor 302. Additional connections to PCI local bus 306 may be made through direct component interconnection or through add-in boards. In the depicted example, local area network (LAN) adapter 310, SCSI host bus adapter 312, and expansion bus interface 314 are connected to PCI local bus 306 by direct component connection. In contrast, audio adapter 316, graphics adapter 318, and audio/video adapter 319 are connected to PCI local bus 306 by add-in boards inserted into expansion slots. Expansion bus interface 314 provides a connection for a keyboard and mouse adapter 320, modem 322, and additional memory 324. Small computer system interface (SCSI) host bus adapter 312 provides a connection for hard disk drive 326, tape drive 328, and CD-ROM drive 330.

        "The client device illustrated in FIG. 3 may be equipped with hardware/software for performing verification and authentication functions based on data received over the electrical network 120 in accordance with the present invention. For example, many motherboards have a basic-input-output-system (BIOS) which provides for multiple levels of password access. The present invention may provide a modified BIOS in which the digital signature, certificate, or the like, generated by the security mechanisms of the server 104, or UPS and power conditioning equipment 160, may be configured into the BIOS such that the client device cannot boot without being in the presence of the electrical signal from the electrical network 120.",

This software/hardware may serve to extract the security information from the security information data received via the electrical network 120, compare it against security information received from the server 104, or security information maintained in a history as discussed previously, and authorize or deny the operation of the client device based on the comparison.",
        "As mentioned previously, the UPS and power conditioning equipment of a site receives or generates security information data that is added to an electrical signal received from an external power network or grid. This modified electrical signal is transmitted through an electrical network of a particular site and is received by data processing devices coupled to the electrical network, e.g., via wall mounted electrical outlets.

As shown in FIG. 4, the AC power modification mechanism 410 receives as inputs an AC electrical signal 420 and a data signal 430. The data signal 430 may be generated based on security information obtained from a server or generated by the UPS and power conditioning equipment, for example. Moreover, the data signal 430 may be a constant signal, such as a non-changing data value, a periodically changing signal, such as a data value that changes after the elapse of a predetermined time period, or may be a continuously changing data signal, such as in the case of a data stream.",
        "The AC power modification mechanism 410 acts as an encoder in that it encodes the AC electrical signal 420 received from an external electrical network, such as a power grid, with the data signal 430. The result is a modified AC electrical signal 450 that is a combination of the AC electrical signal 420 and the data signal 430. The modified AC electrical signal 450 is output to an electrical network that is part of a site-specific network.",

This authentication may take the form of the authentication mentioned above with regard to the three modes of operation.",
        "For example, in one embodiment, the authentication mechanism 750 may be invoked in response to a boot-up or power-up condition of the data processing device. The BIOS or boot code may be modified to perform a check of the security information data being received over the electrical connection of the data processing device. This check may involve receiving the data signal over the electrical connection, decrypting the data signal, and the performing a comparison of the decrypted data with the security information stored by the authentication mechanism 750. This security information may include, for example, a private key, digital certificate, digital signature, password, or the like.",
        "If the comparison results in a match, then the data processing device is determined to be coupled to an electrical network at the site where the data processing device is intended to be and the data processing device is allowed to continue the power-up or boot-up process. If the comparison results in a mismatch, then the data processing device is determined to be either not at the required site or to not be an authorized data processing device for the site at which it is located, and the power-up or boot-up process is not permitted to continue. In this case, the data processing device may be powered-down and/or an error condition may be indicated to a user of the data processing device.",

In such an embodiment, each data packet has security information and a timestamp encrypted and inserted thereon that corresponds to the security information received by a sending data processing device via the electrical network at a particular time. Each data processing device on the electrical network maintains a history of security information received over the electrical network for a predetermined period of time. When a data packet is received, the encrypted security information and timestamp are extracted and decrypted and compared to the recipient data processing device's history.",
        "If matching security information is present in the history at the time indicated by the timestamp, then the data packet may be processed by the recipient data processing device. In addition, the address of the sending data processing device may be added to an authorized data processing device list that indicates the data processing devices that have been identified as being present on the site-specific network. This list may be consulted prior to performing a check of the security information and the timestamp of the data packets in order to bypass this check for data processing devices that have already been authenticated.

The sending data processing device may be informed of the fact that the recipient data processing device is refusing to process the data packets and an administrator of the data network may be alerted to the possibility of an interloper being present on the data network.",

That is, the address of the sending data processing device may be added to a blocked data processing device list and this list may be checked prior to performing the security information and timestamp check discussed above. If the address of a sending data processing device is present in this list, the data packet that it sent may be automatically dropped without having to perform the check of the security information and timestamp. As with the authorized data processing device list, this list may be periodically cleared such that data packets from sending data processing devices are again checked based on the security information and timestamp.",
        "The data signal that is added to the AC electrical signal, in this embodiment, may be a periodically changing data signal or a constantly changing data signal, such as a data stream.

That is, both the power-up or boot-up security check and the data packet processing checks may be performed in this alternative embodiment. In such an embodiment, it may be necessary to have two data signals added to the AC electrical signal. A first data signal representing the security information data used to perform the power-up or boot-up security check and a second data signal representing the security information data used to perform the data packet processing security check.

A data signal is generated based on the received security information (step 830).

As shown in FIG. 9, the operation starts by receiving a power-on or boot-up command (step 910). An AC electrical signal is received from an electrical network (step 920). The AC electrical signal is processed to generate DC current and a \u201cnoise\u201d signal that is interpreted to be a data signal (step 930). An authentication operation is performed based on the data signal (step 940). This may include decrypting data stored in the data signal and comparing the decrypted data to stored security information, for example.",
        "A determination is made as to whether the data processing device is authenticated (step 950). If so, the power-up or boot-up procedure is allowed to continue (step 960). Otherwise, if the data processing device is not authenticated, then the boot-up or power-up operation is discontinued (step 970). The operation then terminates.",

As shown in FIG. 10, the operation starts by receiving a data packet from another data processing device (step 1010). The data value for the security information and the time stamp that are encrypted in the data packet are extracted (step 1020) and decrypted (step 1030). A comparison of the data value to a local history based on the time stamp is then performed (step 1040).",
        "A determination is made as to whether there is a matching entry in the local history for the indicated time stamp (step 1050). If there is a match, the processing of the data packet is permitted (step 1060). If there is not a match, an \u201cunauthorized communication\u201d message may be returned to the other data processing device (step 1070) and the data packet is not processed.

With such an embodiment, a check of these lists may be performed prior to step 1020 in order to avoid having to perform steps 1020-1050. In such an embodiment, if the address of the sending data processing device is present in the authorized data processing device list, the operation may proceed to step 1060 without performing steps 1020-1050. If the address of the sending data processing device is present in the unauthorized data processing device list, the operation may proceed to step 1070 without performing steps 1020-1050.

Rather, the functions associated with performing authentication may be performed in a server or other computing device associated with the data network. For example, the data of a data signal received by a data processing device may be reported to the server and the server may perform the necessary functions to determine whether the data processing device may power-up or boot-up. The server may then send a signal to the data processing device indicating whether continued boot-up or power-up is permitted.",

This history may then be used by the server in a similar manner as discussed previously with regard to determining whether a data packet may be processed by a data processing device. If it is determined that the data packet is not to be processed by the data processing device, the server may simply drop the data packet and not forward it to the data processing device. If the data packet is to be processed, then the data packet may be forwarded by the server to the data processing device.",
