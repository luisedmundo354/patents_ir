        "This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/618,387, filed Oct. 13, 2004, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
        "This invention relates to novel sulfamoyl benzamide compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds, and the use thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel sulfamoyl benzamide compounds that may affect the cannabinoid receptor system and thus may be useful, inter alia, as agonists or antagonists of cannabinoid receptors.",
        "Cannabis sativa preparations have long been known as therapeutic agents to treat various diseases (Mechoulam, R., \u201cCannabinoids as Therapeutic Agents\u201d CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. 1-19, 1986). The native active constituent, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC), is prescribed today, under the generic name dronabinol, as an anti-emetic and for enhancement of appetite, mainly in AIDS patients. However, separation between the clinically undesirable psychotropic effects and the therapeutically desirable effects on the peripheral nervous systems, the cardiovascular system, the immune and endocrine system is problematic. The discovery of two cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, has helped to elucidate the diverse cannabinoid effects.",
        "The CB1 receptor has been cloned from rat, mouse, and human tissues and exhibits 97-99% amino acid sequence identity across species. The CB2 receptor exhibits 48% homology with the CB1 receptor (A. C. Howlett et al. Pharmacological Reviews 2002, 54, 161-202). The structures of both receptors are consistent with seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors. In addition, both receptors exert their effect by negative regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity through pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding proteins. They were also shown to activate the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) in certain cell types (Parolaro, D., Life Sci. 1999, 65, 637-44).",
        "The CB1 receptor is expressed mainly in the CNS and to a lesser extent in other tissues including, for example, gastrointestinal tissues, immune cells, reproductive organs, heart, lung, urinary bladder and adrenal gland. The CB2 receptor is expressed mostly in peripheral tissue associated with immune functions including, for example, macrophages, B, T cells and mast cells, as well as in peripheral nerve terminals (Pertwee, R. G., Prog. Neurobiol. 2001, 63, 569-611). The central distribution pattern of CB1 receptors accounts for several unwanted pharmacological properties of cannabinoids, such as impaired cognition and memory, altered control of motor function, and psychotropic and other neurobehavioral effects. CB1 receptors are also found on pain pathways in brain, spinal cord and at the peripheral terminals of primary sensory neurons (A. S. Rice, Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs 2001 2(3), 399-414).",
        "CB1 knockout mice have been shown to be unresponsive to cannabinoids in behavioral assays providing molecular evidence that the psychotropic effects, including sedation, hallucinations and antinociception are manifested through the activation of the CB1 receptor, present primarily in the CNS. Analysis of the CB2 knockout mouse has corroborated the evidence for the function of CB2 receptors in modulating the immune system. The CB2 receptor does not affect immune cell development and differentiation as determined by FACS analysis of cells from the spleen, lymph node and thymus from CB2 knockout mice. Further studies in these mice have shown that the immunosuppressive effects of \u03949-THC are mediated by the CB2 receptor.",
        "Cannabinoid receptor agonists, such as CP55,940 and WIN 55,212-2, produce potent antinociception with equivalent efficacy to morphine in animal models of acute pain, persistent inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain. They also induce a number of unwanted CNS side effects. Furthermore, the known cannabinoid receptor agonists are in general highly lipophilic and insoluble in water. There is thus a need for cannabinoid receptor agonists with improved properties for the use as therapeutic agents.",
        "Known CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonists produce a characteristic profile of in vivo effects in mice, including suppression of spontaneous activity, antinociception, hypothermia, and catalepsy. Measurement of these four properties, commonly referred to as the tetrad test, has played a key role in establishing the structure-activity relation of cannabinoids and cannabimemetics acting at CB1 receptors. Catalepsy in mice is indicative of CB1 activation and predictive of cannabinoid psychoactivity. Pertwee showed a correlation between catalepsy in the ring test in mice and the previously validated dog static ataxia model (R. G. Pertwee, Br. J. Pharmacology 1972, 46, 753-763). Therefore, catalepsy in mice is viewed as excellent predictor of CNS effects in humans (D. R. Compton, Marijuana: An International Research Report 7, 213-218, 1987; E. W. Gill and G. Jones, Biochem. Pharmacol. 21, 2237-2248, 1972; E. W. Gill et al. Nature 228, 134-136, 1970).",
        "Efforts have been made to separate therapeutic effects from undesirable CNS side effects by increasing the selectivity for the CB2 receptor, thereby leading to efforts to design compounds with selectivity for the CB2 receptor over the CB1 receptor. These compounds would be predicted to lack side effects even if they penetrate the CNS because they would not activate the CB1 receptors in the CNS (Malan, T. Philip, Jr. et al. \u201cCB2 cannabinoid receptor agonists: pain relief without psychoactive effects?\u201d Curr Op. Pharm. 2003, 3(1), 62-67; WO2004/017920).",
        "Recent studies have identified CB2 selective inverse agonists with antiedema effects in vivo (Iwamura et al., J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 2001, 420-425; Lavey et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005, 783-786), suggesting an involvement of CB2 selective inverse agonists in inflammatory processes and the pharmacological efficacy of CB2 inverse agonists by themselves.",
        "Lunn, et al. (ICRS 15th Annual Symposium of the Cannabinoids, Clearwater Beach, Fla., Jun. 24-27, 2005) have reported that CB2 receptor-selective inverse agonists are capable of altering cellular chemotaxis mediated by either cannabinoids or chemokines, both in vivo and in vitro. They have reported that administration of these compounds can decrease allergic eosinophilia in animal models for asthma.",
        "Other research has shown that pharmacological antagonists of CB1 and CB2 receptors prevented ovariectomy-induced bone loss in vivo and caused osteoclast inhibition in vitro by promoting osteoclast apoptosis and inhibiting production of several osteoclast survival factors. These studies show that the CB1 receptor has a role in the regulation of bone mass and ovariectomy-induced bone loss and that CB1- and CB2-selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists are a new class of osteoclast inhibitors that may be of value in the treatment of osteoporosis and other bone diseases (A. I Idris, et al., Nature Medicine, 2005,11(7), 774-79).",
        "There is considerable interest in developing new cannabimimetic compounds possessing preferentially high affinity for the CB2 receptor. Such compounds that preferentially stimulate the CB2 receptor, directly or indirectly, may provide clinically useful effects without unwanted effects on the subject's central nervous system and can offer a rational therapeutic approach to a variety of disease states. The present invention is directed to these and other important ends.",
        "Accordingly, the present invention is directed, in part, to novel sulfamoyl benzamide compounds which may be modulators, agonists, inverse agonists, and/or antagonists of cannabinoid receptors and which thus may be useful, inter alia, for the treatment of diseases or disorders which are associated with the cannabinoid receptor system.",

        "Accordingly, the present invention is directed, in part, to a new class of cannabinoid receptor modulator compounds, preferably phenyl compounds, which are highly useful in connection with the binding of cannabinoid receptors. Compounds binding cannabinoid receptors may act as agonists, inverse agonists, and/or antagonists toward the cannabinoid receptors. In situations where a cannabimimetic compound or ligand agonizes one or more cannabinoid receptors, the resultant binding is believed to trigger an event or series of events in the cell that results in a change in the cell's activity, its gene regulation, or the signals that it sends to neighboring cells, similar to that of a cannabinoid. Thus, in some embodiments, compounds of the invention may serve as preventatives or treatments of diseases or disorders in which cannabinoid receptors are implicated. In situations where a cannabimimetic compound or ligand antagonizes one or more cannabinoid receptors, the resultant binding typically occurs comparatively to a greater extent relative to that of the endogenous cannabinoid, but does not trigger one or more of the events of signal transduction. Compounds acting as inverse agonists are believed to bind more strongly to the inactive form of the receptor, thereby inhibiting the normal regulatory functions of the receptor and its endogenous regulatory ligands. Compounds with either inverse agonist or antagonist properties are highly useful, for example, in connection with the study of functions of cannabinoid receptors, which may result, for example, in the development of new cannabimimetic agonist compounds, such as those, for example, reported in Rinaldi-Carmona, M. et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 1998, 284(2), 644-650, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety.",

Preferably, the daily dosage may be about 0.01 to about 10 milligrams of the compound of the invention, preferably a compound as described herein per kilogram of patient body weight. Even more preferably, the daily dosage may be about 0.1 milligrams of the compound of the invention, preferably a compound as described herein per kilogram of patient body weight. With regard to a typical dosage form of this type, such as a tablet, the compounds of the invention, preferably a compound as described herein, generally may be present in an amount of about 0.1 to about 4 milligrams.",
        "The combination products of this invention, such as pharmaceutical compositions comprising cannabinoids and/or opioids in combination with the compounds described herein may be in any dosage form, such as those described herein, and can also be administered in various ways, as described herein. In a preferred embodiment, the combination products of the invention are formulated together, in a single dosage form (that is, combined together in one capsule, tablet, powder, or liquid, etc.). When the combination products are not formulated together in a single dosage form, the cannabinoid and/or opioid compounds and the compounds described herein may be administered at the same time (that is, together), or in any order. When not administered at the same time, preferably the administration of a cannabinoid and/or opioid and the compounds as described herein occurs less than about one hour apart, more preferably less than about 30 minutes apart, even more preferably less than about 15 minutes apart, and still more preferably less than about 5 minutes apart. Preferably, administration of the combination products of the invention is oral, although other routes of administration, as described above, are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention. Although it is preferable that the cannabinoids and/or opioids and the compounds as described herein are both administered in the same fashion (that is, for example, both orally), if desired, they may each be administered in different fashions (that is, for example, one component of the combination product may be administered orally, and another component may be administered intravenously). The dosage of the combination products of the invention may vary depending upon various factors such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration, the age, health and weight of the recipient, the nature and extent of the symptoms, the kind of concurrent treatment, the frequency of treatment, and the effect desired.",
        "Although the proper dosage of the combination products of this invention will be readily ascertainable by one skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure, by way of general guidance, where a cannabinoid and/or opioid compound is combined with the compounds as described herein, for example, typically a daily dosage may range from about 0.01 to about 100 milligrams of the cannabinoid and/or opioid (and all combinations and subcombinations of ranges therein) and about 0.001 to about 100 milligrams of the compounds as described herein (and all combinations and subcombinations of ranges therein), per kilogram of patient body weight. Preferably, the a daily dosage may be about 0.1 to about 10 milligrams of the cannabinoid and/or opioid and about 0.01 to about 10 milligrams of the compounds as described herein per kilogram of patient body weight. Even more preferably, the daily dosage may be about 1.0 milligrams of the cannabinoid and/or opioid and about 0.1 milligrams of the compounds as described herein per kilogram of patient body weight. With regard to a typical dosage form of this type of combination product, such as a tablet, the cannabinoid compounds (e.g. \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabidiol) and/or the opioid compounds (e.g., morphine) and generally may be present in an amount of about 15 to about 200 milligrams, and the compounds as described herein in an amount of about 0.1 to about 4 milligrams.",
        "Particularly when provided as a single dosage form, the potential exists for a chemical interaction between the combined active ingredients (for example, a cannabinoid and the compounds as described herein). For this reason, the preferred dosage forms of the combination products of this invention are formulated such that although the active ingredients are combined in a single dosage form, the physical contact between the active ingredients is minimized (that is, reduced).",
        "In order to minimize contact, one embodiment of this invention where the product is orally administered provides for a combination product wherein one active ingredient is enteric coated. By enteric coating one or more of the active ingredients, it is possible not only to minimize the contact between the combined active ingredients, but also, it is possible to control the release of one of these components in the gastrointestinal tract such that one of these components is not released in the stomach but rather is released in the intestines. Another embodiment of this invention where oral administration is desired provides for a combination product wherein one of the active ingredients is coated with a sustained-release material that effects a sustained-release throughout the gastrointestinal tract and also serves to minimize physical contact between the combined active ingredients. Furthermore, the sustained-released component can be additionally enteric coated such that the release of this component occurs only in the intestine. Still another approach would involve the formulation of a combination product in which the one component is coated with a sustained and/or enteric release polymer, and the other component is also coated with a polymer such as a low-viscosity grade of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or other appropriate materials as known in the art, in order to further separate the active components. The polymer coating serves to form an additional barrier to interaction with the other component.",
        "Dosage forms of the combination products of the present invention wherein one active ingredient is enteric coated can be in the form of tablets such that the enteric coated component and the other active ingredient are blended together and then compressed into a tablet or such that the enteric coated component is compressed into one tablet layer and the other active ingredient is compressed into an additional layer. Optionally, in order to further separate the two layers, one or more placebo layers may be present such that the placebo layer is between the layers of active ingredients. In addition, dosage forms of the present invention can be in the form of capsules wherein one active ingredient is compressed into a tablet or in the form of a plurality of microtablets, particles, granules or non-perils, which are then enteric coated. These enteric coated microtablets, particles, granules or non-perils are then placed into a capsule or compressed into a capsule along with a granulation of the other active ingredient.",
        "These as well as other ways of minimizing contact between the components of combination products of the present invention, whether administered in a single dosage form or administered in separate forms but at the same time by the same manner, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure.",
        "It will be further appreciated that the amount of the compound, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician.",
        "The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye.",
        "The dose may also be provided by controlled release of the compound, by techniques well known to those in the art.",
        "Pharmaceutical kits useful in, for example, the treatment of pain, which comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a cannabinoid and/or opioid along with a therapeutically effective amount of a sulfamoyl benzamide compound of the invention, in one or more sterile containers, are also within the ambit of the present invention. Sterilization of the container may be carried out using conventional sterilization methodology well known to those skilled in the art. The sterile containers of materials may comprise separate containers, or one or more multi-part containers, as exemplified by the UNIVIAL\u2122 two-part container (available from Abbott Labs, Chicago, Ill.), as desired. The opioid or cannabinoid compound and the compound as described herein may be separate, or combined into a single dosage form as described above. Such kits may further include, if desired, one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such as for example, one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional vials for mixing the components, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Instructions, either as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to be administered, guidelines for administration, and/or guidelines for mixing the components, may also be included in the kit.",
        "The compounds of the present invention may be used in methods to bind cannabinoid receptors, more preferably CB1 or CB2 cannabinoid receptors, still more preferably CB2 receptors. Such binding may be accomplished by contacting the receptor with an effective amount of the compound of the invention. The cannabinoid receptors may be located in the central nervous system or located peripherally to the central nervous system or in both locations. Preferably, the contacting step conducted in an aqueous medium, preferably at physiologically relevant ionic strength, pH, and the like.",

        "Preparation of Animals.",
        "Male Sprague-Dawley rats (120-250 g, Harlan Laboratories, Columbus, Ohio) were housed in pairs and allowed free access to food and water throughout the study. Room temperature and humidity were maintained at 21\u00b0 C. and 70%, respectively. Nerve injury was produced with tight ligation of the left L5 spinal nerve (Kim, S. H., and J. M. Chung, Pain, 50, 355-363 (1992); LaBuda, C. J. and Fuchs, P. N., Exp Neurol., 163, 490-494(2000); LaBuda, C. J. and Fuchs, P. N., Neurosci Letters, 290, 137-140(2000); LaBuda, C. J., Donahue, R., Fuchs, P. N., Pain, 94, 59-63, (2001)). Briefly, animals were placed in the prone position to access the left L4-L6 spinal nerves. Under magnification, approximately one third of the L6 transverse process was removed. The L5 spinal nerve was identified and carefully dissected free from the adjacent L4 spinal nerve and then tightly ligated using 6-0 silk suture. The wound was treated with an antiseptic solution, the muscle layer was sutured, and the wound was closed with wound clips. Sham-operated surgical controls were prepared in the same manner, but the L5 spinal nerve was not exposed. All housing conditions and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the IASP and the Adolor Corporation Animal Care and Use Committee.",
        "Behavioral Testing.",
        "Seven to ten animals per group were used for all behavioral assays. After a 7-10 day post-surgical recovery, animals were tested for baseline sensitivity to tactile stimulation of both hindpaws. Allodynic animals were defined as animals having a threshold of less than 7.5 grams of pressure applied to the injured hindpaw. Tactile sensitivity was evaluated using von Frey monofilaments before and after treatment. Animals received a coded injection of physiological saline or test compound (0, 10 or 30 mg/kg, i.p.). Thirty minutes after treatment, tactile sensitivity was evaluated. Five to seven days later, animals were tested using a different compound. Each animal was tested three times with different compounds. All behavioral testing was performed between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM in a well-illuminated room with white background noise.",
        "Tactile Sensitivity.",
        "Animals were placed in a Plexiglas chamber (20 cm\u00d710.5 cm\u00d740.5 cm) and habituated for 15 minutes. The chamber was positioned on top of a mesh screen so that von Frey monofilaments could be presented to the plantar surfaces of both hindpaws. Measurements of tactile sensitivity for each hindpaw were obtained using the up/down method (Dixon, W. J., Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol 20, 441-462, 1980) with seven von Frey monofilaments (0.04, 0.07, 0.16, 0.4, 1, 6, and 15 grams). Each trial started with a von Frey force of 0.4 g delivered to the right hindpaw and then the left hindpaw for approximately 1-2 sec each. If there was no withdrawal response, the next higher force was delivered. If there was a response, the next lower force was delivered. This procedure was performed until no response was made at the highest force (15 grams) or until four stimuli were administered following the initial response. The 50% paw withdrawal threshold for each paw was calculated using the following formula: [Xth]log=[vFr]log+ky where [vFr] is the force of the last von Frey filament used, k=0.2249 which is the average interval (in log units) between the von Frey monofilaments, and y is a value that depends upon the pattern of withdrawal responses (Dixon, Id.). If an animal did not respond to the highest von Frey hair (15 g), then the paw was assigned a value of 18.23 g. Testing for tactile sensitivity was performed twice and the mean 50% withdrawal value assigned as the tactile sensitivity for the right and left paws for each animal.",
        "Statistical Analysis.",
        "Tactile sensitivity for both hindpaws before and after treatments were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc comparisons (protected t-test) for group differences. An alpha level of 0.05 was used for all analyses.",
