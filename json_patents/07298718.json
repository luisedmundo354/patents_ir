        "1. Field",
        "The present invention relates generally to communications systems, and more specifically, to systems and techniques to optimize channel allocations in a communications systems.",
        "2. Background",
        "Modern communications systems are designed to allow multiple users to access a common communications medium. Numerous multiple-access techniques are known in the art, such as time division multiple-access (TDMA), frequency division multiple-access (FDMA), space division multiple-access, polarization division multiple-access, code division multiple-access (CDMA), and other similar multi-access techniques. The multiple-access concept is a channel allocation methodology which allows multiple user access to a common communications medium. The channel allocations can take on various forms depending on the specific multi-access technique. By way of example, in FDMA systems, the total frequency spectrum is divided into a number of smaller sub-bands and each user is given its own sub-band to access the communications medium. Alternatively, in TDMA systems, each user is given the entire frequency spectrum during periodically recurring time slots. In CDMA systems, each user is given the entire frequency spectrum for all of the time but distinguishes its transmission through the use of a unique code.",
        "CDMA is a modulation and multiple access technique based on spread-spectrum communications. In a CDMA communications system, a large number of signals share the same frequency spectrum. This is achieved by transmitting each signal with a different code that modulates a carrier, and thereby, spreads the spectrum of the signal waveform. The transmitted signals are separated in the receiver by a correlator that uses a corresponding code to despread the desired signal's spectrum. The undesired signals, whose codes do not match, are not despread in bandwidth and contribute only to noise.",
        "The use of CDMA techniques for multiple access communications generally provides increased user capacity over traditional TDMA and FDMA techniques. As a result, more users can access a network, or communicate with one another, through one or more base stations. In CDMA communications systems, the channel allocations are based on orthogonal sequences known as Walsh codes. Theoretically, maximum capacity of the CDMA communications system can be achieved when each available Walsh code is used to spread the traffic channels between multiple users. However, as a practical matter, numerous Walsh code channels may be required to support various control channels such as the pilot channel and other commonly used control channels. These control channels can generally be thought of as overhead which tends to consume bandwidth and decrease user capacity by reducing the number of Walsh channels available for traffic. With the tremendous increase in wireless applications over the past years, there is a need for a more efficient and robust data format which reduces overhead and increases throughput. This need is not limited to CDMA communications, but applies to various other communications systems.",
        "In one aspect of the present invention, a method of communications includes calculating a value from data, transmitting the value and data over at least one time slot, receiving the transmission, recalculating the value from the received data, and determining the number of time slots of the transmission from the calculated and recalculated values.",
        "In another aspect of the present invention, a communications system includes a base station having a channel element configured to calculate a value from data, and a transmitter configured to transmit the value and data over at least one time slot, and a subscriber station having a receiver configured to receive the transmission, and a processor configured to recalculate the value from the received data, and determine the number of time slots of the transmission from the calculated and recalculated values.",
        "In yet another aspect of the present invention, a receiving device includes a receiver configured to receive a transmission over at least one time slot, the transmission comprising data and a value calculated from the data, and a processor configured to recalculate the value from the received data, and determine the number of time slots of the transmission from the calculated and recalculated values.",
        "In a further aspect of the present invention, a computer-readable media embodying a program of instructions executable by a computer program performs a method of communications, the method includes receiving a transmission over at least one time slot, the transmission comprising data and a value calculated from the data, recalculating the value from the received data, and determining the number of time slots of the transmission from the calculated and recalculated values.",
        "In yet a further aspect of the present invention, a communications system includes a base station having means for calculating a value from data, and transmission means for transmitting the value and data over at least one time slot, and a subscriber station having means for receiving the transmission, recalculation means for recalculating the value from the received data, and determination means for determining the number of time slots of the transmission from the calculated and recalculated values.",
        "In yet another aspect of the present invention, a receiving device includes means for receiving a transmission over at least one time slot, the transmission comprising data and a value calculated from the data, recalculation means for recalculating the value from the received data, and determination means for determining the number of time slots of the transmission from the calculated and recalculated values.",
        "It is understood that other aspects of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein is shown and described only exemplary embodiments of the invention, simply by way of illustration. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details are capable of modifications in various respects, all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.",

        "In an exemplary embodiment of a communications system, data can be transmitted between two communications devices over one or more time slots.

At the receiving end, the value can be recalculated from the data, and the number of time slots of the transmission can be determined from the recalculated value and the value embedded in the transmission. This approach tends to reduce overhead by eliminating a secondary channel often used in communications systems to identify the number of time slots occupied by the transmission.",
        "Various aspects of the present invention will be described in the context of a CDMA communications system supporting circuit-switch voice and high speed packet data applications. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that these inventive aspects are likewise suitable for use in various other communications environments. Accordingly, any reference to a CDMA communications system is intended only to illustrate the inventive aspects of the present invention, with the understanding that such inventive aspects have a wide range of applications.",
        "FIG. 1 is a simplified functional block diagram of an exemplary CDMA communications system supporting circuit-switched voice and high speed packet data applications. A base station controller 102 can be used to provide an interface between a network 104 and all base stations dispersed throughout a geographic region. The geographic region may be divided into subregions known as cells or sectors. A base station is generally assigned to serve all subscriber stations in a subregion. For ease of explanation, only one base station 106 is shown. A subscriber station 108 may access the network 104, or communicate with other subscriber stations (not shown), through one or base stations under control of the base station controller 102.",
        "FIG. 2 is an exemplary functional block diagram illustrating the basic subsystems of the exemplary CDMA communications system of FIG. 1. The base station controller 102 contains many selector elements, although only one selector element 204 is shown for simplicity. One selector element is used to control the transmissions between one or more base stations in communication with a single subscriber station 108. When a call is initiated, a call control processor 202 can be used to establish the connection between the selector element 204 and the base station 106. The base station 106 can then assign a MAC (Media Access Controller) ID to identify communications intended for the subscriber station 108 over that connection. The assigned MAC ID can be transmitted from the base station 106 to the subscriber station 108 with the exchange of signaling messages during call set up.",
        "The selector element 204 can be configured to receive circuit-switched voice and data from the network 104. The selector element 204 sends the circuit-switched voice and data to each base station in communication with the intended subscriber station 108. The base station 106 generates a forward link transmission that includes a forward packet data channel for high speed delivery of the data from the base station 106 to one or more subscriber stations. The forward link refers to the transmission from the base station 106 to the subscriber station 108. The forward packet data channel can be composed of any number of Walsh code subchannels depending on the demands of the circuit-switched voice and data users The forward packet data channel generally serves one subscriber station at a time in a time-division multiplexed fashion.",
        "The base station 106 may include a data queue 206 which buffers the data from the selector element 204 before transmission to the subscriber station 108. The data from the data queue 206 can be provided to a channel element 208. The channel element 208 partitions the data into multiple data packets. Depending on the number of data packets needed to support the communications from the selector element 204, any number of Walsh code subcbannels may be used. The channel element 208 then encodes the data packets using a coding process such as Turbo coding, scrambles the encoded symbols using a long pseudo-random noise (PN) sequence, and interleaves the scrambled symbols. Some or all of the interleaved symbols can then be selected to fonn data subpackets for the initial forward link transmission or retransmission. The data subpacker symbols can then be modulated by the channel element 208 using QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), 8-PSK, 16-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), or any other modulation scheme known in the art, demultiplexed into in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components and covered with distinct Walsh codes. The modulated symbols for each Walsh code subchannel can then be combined by the channel element 208 and quadrature spread using short PN code& The short PN codes are a second layer of coding that is used to isolate one subregion from another. This approach allows the re-use of Walsh codes in every subregion. The quadrature spread channel can then provided to a transmitter 210 for filtering, upconvertion, and amplification before transmission over the forward link from the base station 106 to the subscriber station 108 via an antenna 212.",
        "The control and scheduling functions can be provided by a channel scheduler 214. The channel scheduler 214 receives the queue size from the data queue 206 and an indication of the channel quality from the subscriber station 108. With this information, the channel scheduler schedules the data subpacket size and data rate for the forward link transmission to maximize throughput and minimize transmission delay. The data packet or subpacket size is defined by the number of bits contained therein. Depending on the data packet size and the scheduled data rate, the data subpackets can be transmitted over one or more time slots. In one exemplary embodiment of a CDMA communications system, the data subpackets can be transmitted over one, two, four or eight 1.25 millisecond (ms) time slots.",
        "The channel scheduler 214 may also schedule the modulation format of the data subpacket based on the quality of the communications channel between the base station 106 and the subscriber station 108. By way of example, in a relatively distortion free environment with little or no interference, the channel scheduler 214 may schedule a high data rate to transmit each data subpacket over one time slot with a 16-QAM modulation format. Conversely, for subscriber stations with poor channel conditions, the channel scheduler 214 may schedule a low data rate to transmit each data subpacket over eight time slots with a QPSK modulation format. The optimal combination of data rate and modulation format to maximize the throughput of the system can be readily determined by those skilled in the art.",
        "The forward link transmission generated by the base station 106 may also include one or more forward packet data control channels associated with the forward packet data channel. Conventional high speed packet data systems with multiple time slot arrangements often utilize two forward packet data control channels: a forward primary packet data control channel and a forward secondary packet data control channel. The forward secondary packet data control channel carries information subpackets which can be used by the subscriber station to receive or decode corresponding data subpackets on the forward packet data channel. Specifically, the information subpacket includes a 6-bit MAC ID which identifies the intended subscriber station for the corresponding data subpacket, a 2-bit subpacket ID which identifies the corresponding data subpacket, a 2-bit ARQ channel ID which identifies the data packet from which the corresponding data subpacket was derived, and a 2-bit length field which indicates the corresponding data subpacket size. In a manner similar to the forward packet data channel, the information subpackets carried by the forward secondary packet data control channel can be transmitted over one or more slots to optimize communications with various subscriber stations having different channel conditions. In one exemplary embodiment of a CDMA communications system, the information subpacket can be transmitted over the forward secondary packet data control channel in one, two or four 1.25 ms time slots depending on the number of time slots occupied by the corresponding data subpacket. By way of example, the information subpacket on the forward secondary packet data control channel can be transmitted over one time slot for a one time slot data subpacket, two time slots for a two time slot data subpacket, or four time slots for a four or eight time slot data subpacket. The forward primary packet data control channel carries a subpacket which includes information that indicates the number of time slots occupied by the corresponding information subpacket carried on the forward secondary packet data control channel.",
        "In at least one embodiment of a CDMA communications system employing multiple slot transmissions, the primary and secondary packet data control channels can be consolidated into one forward packet data control channel. In this embodiment, the number of time slots occupied by the information subpacket carried on the forward packet data control channel can be determined from subpacket itself. This can be achieved in a variety of fashions. By way of example, a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value can be included in the information subpacket carried on the forward packet data control channel. The CRC can be calculated by performing a known algorithm on the bit sequence forming the information subpacket. At the subscriber station, a CRC check function can be performed on information subpackets addressed to the subscriber station via the MAC ID. Specifically, the CRC can be recalculated over various time slot arrangements, and the recalculated CRC values can be compared to the CRC value included in the information subpacket. The length of the information subpacket, i.e., the number of time slots occupied by the information subpacket, can then be determined from the recalculated CRC value that matches the CRC value from the information subpacket. If none of the CRC values recalculated by the subscriber station match the CRC value from the information subpacket, then the subscriber station assumes that the corresponding data subpacket was intended for another subscriber station.",
        "Once the number of times slots occupied by the information subpacket is determined, it can be used to decode the corresponding data packet. If the subscriber station can successfully decode the data packet, which includes the current data subpacket and any previously received data subpackets for the data packet, then the subscriber station sends an acknowledgement (ACK) response to the base station. If the data packet cannot be successfully decoded, the subscriber station then sends a negative acknowledgement (NACK) response requesting additional data subpackets. The data packet may be deemed successfully decoded if the data packet CRC checks.",
        "The CRC protected subpacket may also provide additional benefits. By way of example, increased system throughput may be realized by decreasing the false-alarm probability of the forward packet data control channel. The false-alarm probability is the probability that a subscriber station will attempt to erroneously decode a data subpacket intended for another subscriber station.",
        "Further increases in user capacity and throughput may be achieved by expanding the length of the MAC ID from 6-bits to 8-bits to increase the number of users that can access the CDMA communications system. The exact number of bits used for the MAC ID is a matter of design and may vary depending on the overall design criteria of the communications system and the performance requirements. Regardless of the number of bits ultimately selected by the skilled artisan, an expanded MAC ID can reduce the delay and signaling overhead associated with frequent changes in active users. The expanded MAC ID length may also minimize the false-alarm probability by requiring more bits to be matched with the subscriber station MAC ID before the information subpacket is declared valid. By minimizing the false-alarm probability, the throughput of the CDMA communications system may be increased. Those skilled in the art will readily be able to assess performance tradeoffs of the system to ascertain the optimal bit length for the MAC ID to maximize user capacity and throughput.",
        "In at least one exemplary embodiment of a CDMA communications system, a data compression algorithm can be used to minimize the overhead required to transmit the information needed for decoding the forward packet data channel. This can be achieved by establishing various forward link transmission formats and assigning a binary code to each transmission format. By way of illustration, the channel element 208 can partition the data into data packets having one of two possible sizes. Depending on the data rate scheduled by the channel scheduler 214, the data packets can be transmitted over a fixed number of Walsh subchannels with a one, two, four or eight slot format. Assuming four possible data rates that can be scheduled, one for each multiple time slot format, eight binary codes would be needed to indicate the data packet size, the data rate, and the number of time slots for the data subpacket transmission. Eight binary codes can be represented by three bits. The number of forward link transmission formats and the overhead to support it can be varied depending on the overall design parameters, and those skilled in the art will be readily be able to assess system tradeoffs to optimize performance. By way of example, the channel element 208 may be configured to support more data subpacket sizes. This approach may improve system throughput by providing an increase in the data subpacket size for higher data rates that can be supported by the subscriber station 108.",
        "Table 1 illustrates one possible approach for transmitting the data subpackets over the forward link using twenty-eight 32-chip Walsh subchannels. In this embodiment, there are twenty-four possible forward link transmission formats with six different data packet sizes, fifteen different data rates, and three different modulation formats for transmission over one, two, four or eight time slots.",

        "TABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\nValue\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00HEX to 17HEX\nInitial Subpacket (Subpacket ID = 0)\n\n\n\nwith a Format of 0 to 23\n\n\n18HEX to 3CHEX\nReserved\n\n\n3DHEX to 3FHEX\nNoninitial Subpacket with a Subpacket ID of 1 to 3",
        "The exemplary compression algorithm described in connection with Table 2 may also reduce the false-alarm probability, and thereby, increase system throughput. Since more than one-half of the binary codes for the data subpacket format and ID are not used, the probability that this 6-bit sequence, if corrupted by the communications channel, will match a valid sequence is less than one-half. Those skilled in the art will be readily able to ascertain system tradeoffs to determine the optimal compression algorithm to enhance system performance. By way of example, the bit sequence can be expanded to increase the number of transmission formats available and/or the throughput of the system at the cost of additional overhead. Alternatively, the compression algorithm can be fixed at 6-bits with additional transmission formats being assigned to the unused values at the risk of a higher false-alarm rate. Conversely, the number of transmission formats can be reduced resulting in more unused values which tends to decrease the false-alarm probability.",
        "The compression algorithm for specifying the data subpacket format and ID of Table 1 can be reduced twofold by using the slot duration of the information subpacket to specify the slot duration of the corresponding data subpacket. By way of example, the information subpacket on the forward packet data control channel can be transmitted over one time slot for a one time slot data subpacket, two time slots for a two time slot data subpacket, or four time slots for a four or eight time slot data subpacket. This approach reduces the number of possible subpacket formats from twenty-four to twelve. As a result, only the first twelve values, i.e., 00HEX to 0CHEX, are required for the initial data subpacket transmission leaving the next forty-eight values, i.e., 0DHEX to 3CHEX, unused. With more unused values in the compression algorithm, the false-alarm probability tends to decrease. Alternatively, the bit length of the compression algorithm can be reduced to save overhead.",
        "The channel element 208 can be used to generate the information for the forward packet data control channel. Based on the number of Walsh subchannels available for the forward packet data channel, the channel element 208 generates a 6-bit subpacket format and ID for the initial information subpacket transmission as a function of the data subpacket size, the scheduled data rate, and the scheduled modulation format. This information can be obtained from the channel scheduler 214. The channel element 208 also generates the 6-bit subpacket format and ID for the information subpackets that follow the initial transmission. The channel element 208 generates an information subpacket payload by packaging the 6-bit subpacket format and ID with a 2-bit ARQ ID identifying the data packet from which the corresponding data subpacket was derived, and an 8-bit MAC ID identifying the intended subscriber station of the information subpacket.",
        "The channel element 208 can be implemented in electronic hardware, in computer software, or in a combination of the two. The channel element 208 may be implemented with a general or special purpose processor, a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or other programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination thereof designed to perform one or more of the functions described herein. In one exemplary embodiment of the channel element 208, the channel element functions can be performed with a general purpose processor such as a microprocessor, or a special purpose processor such as a programmable DSP having an embedded communications software layer to implement the channel element functions. In this embodiment, the communications software layer can be used to invoke various encoders, modulators and supporting functions to accommodate various multiple slot transmissions.",
        "FIG. 3 is a functional block diagram of a channel element configuration for generating an exemplary forward packet data control channel for a one slot transmission. In this configuration, the 16-bit payload is provided to a CRC generator 302. The CRC generator 302 can be used to calculate the CRC value over the entire payload or any portion thereof. By calculating the CRC value over only a portion of the payload, a reduction in computational complexity may be achieved. The CRC value can be any number of bits depending on the design parameters. In the described exemplary embodiment, the CRC generator 302 appends 8-bits to the payload.",
        "The 24-bit CRC protected payload can be provided to an encoder tail generator 304. The encoder tail generator 304 generates a sequence of bits that is appended to the end of the payload. The bit sequence that makes up the tail is used to ensure that decoder at the subscriber station is provided with a sequence that ends at a known state, thus facilitating accurate decoding. An 8-bit tail can be generated by the tail generator, however, as those skilled in the art will readily recognize, the tail can be any length.",
        "The 32-bit CRC protected payload with the encoder tail can be provided to a convolutional encoder 306. The convolutional encoder 306 provides forward error correction capability at the subscriber station and can be implemented with any code rate and constraint length depending on the particular design parameters and the overall system constraints. In the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 3, the convolutional coding is performed at a \u2153 rate with a constraint length of 9. As a result, the 32-bit sequence input to the convolutional encoder 306 is encoded into a 96-symbol sequence. Convolutional encoding is well known, and those skilled in the art will readily be ascertained performance tradeoffs to determine the appropriate rate and constraint length to optimize performance.",
        "The 96-symbol sequence generated by the convolutional encoder 306 can be coupled to a demultiplexer 308 which demultiplexes the symbols into two 48-symbol sequences. The 48-symbol sequence results in a 38.4 ksps (kilo-symbols per second) rate for a one slot transmission having a duration of 1.25 ms.",
        "Various processing techniques can be applied to the two 48-symbol sequences to minimize the affect of burst errors on the ability of the decoder at the subscriber station to decode the symbol sequence. By way of example, the two 48-symbol sequences from the demultiplexer 308 can be provided to respective block interleavers 310a and 310b which alters the sequence of the symbols. The two interleaved 48-symbol sequences can then be shifted in time with respect to one another by a half-slot. This can be achieved with a cyclic shifter 312 that shifts the 48-symbol sequence from one of the block interleavers 310b in time by 24 symbols.",
        "The symbol sequence from the block interleaver 310a and the symbol sequence from the cyclic shifter 312 can be provided to respective modulators which may support various modulation schemes such as QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM, or any other modulation scheme known in the art. In the described exemplary embodiment, two QPSK modulators 314a and 314b, one for each 48-symbol sequence, are used. The modulated symbols from each of the modulators 314a and 314b can then be separated into their respective I and Q components and covered with a distinct Walsh code by multipliers 316a and 316b before being combined with the forward packet data channel and other Walsh subchannels. The combined Walsh subchannels can then be quadrature spread using the short PN codes and coupled to the transmitter 210 for filtering, upconvertion, and amplification before transmission over the forward link from the base station 106 to the subscriber station 108 (see FIG. 2).",
        "Alternatively, the forward packet data control channel can be transmitted over a single Walsh subchannel to conserve resources during periods of high demand among the packet data users. With this approach, the demultiplexer 308 can be configured to puncture 48 symbols from the 96-symbol sequence generated by the convolution encoder 306. The nonpunctured or remaining 48 symbols can be interleaved, modulated, separating into their respective I and Q components, and spread with a distinct Walsh code as shown in the upper demultiplexed symbol sequence of FIG. 3. With this approach, the block interleaver 310b, the cyclic shifter 312, the modulator 314b, and the multiplier 316b are not used.",
        "FIG. 4 is a functional block diagram of a channel element configuration for generating an exemplary forward packet data control channel for a two slot transmission. In a manner similar to the one slot transmission format, the 16-bit payload can be appended with an 8-bit CRC value produced by the CRC generator 302 and an 8-bit encoder tail produced by the encoder tail generator 304. The resultant 32-bit sequence can be encoded with the convolutional encoder 306 at a \u2153 rate with a constraint length of 9 to produce a 96-symbol sequence.",
        "The main difference between the one and two slot transmission formats is the addition of a sequence repeater 402 following the convolutional encoder 306 to produce the two slot transmission format. In the described exemplary embodiment, the sequence repeater 402 is positioned at the output of the convolutional encoder 306, however, the sequence repeater 402 could alternatively be positioned downstream. The sequence repeater 402 can be configured to repeat the symbol sequence as many times as desired depending on the system requirements. By way of example, the 96-symbol sequence from the convolutional encoder 306 can be repeated twice to produce a 192-symbol sequence for a two slot transmission. Alternatively, the 96-symbol sequence from the convolutional encoder 306 could be repeated four times to produce a 384-symbol sequence for a four slot transmission. The repetition number can be preset by the designer, or alternatively programmed either manually or on the fly in an automated fashion. In the described exemplary embodiment of FIG. 4, the repetition number is set at two resulting in a 192-symbol sequence.",

        "Further reductions in computational complexity for a single Walsh subchannel transmission can be achieved by simply eliminating the sequence repeater 402. With this approach, the 96-symbol sequence from the convolutional encoder 306 can be provided directly to the block interleaver 310a. As a consequence, more encoder functions can be eliminated than with the previous approach discussed earlier including the sequence repeater 402, the block interleaver 310b, the cyclic shifter 312, the modulator 314b, and the multiplier 216b.",

        "Returning to FIG. 2, the forward link transmission from the base station 106 is received by an antenna 215 at the subscriber station 108. The received signal may be routed from the antenna 215 to a receiver 216. The receiver filters and amplifies the signal, down converts the signal to baseband, and quadrature demodulates the baseband signal. The baseband signal can then be sampled and stored in memory 218. The memory 218 should be sufficiently sized to store enough samples, or chips, to cover the maximum allowable number of time slots for a forward link subpacket transmission.",

These functions may be implemented directly in hardware, in software executed by the processor, or in a combination of the two. The processor may be implemented with a general or special purpose processor, a DSP, an ASIC, a FPGA or other programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination thereof designed to perform one or more of the aforesaid functions.

The CRC generator 226 generates a CRC value and compares the locally generated CRC value with the decoded CRC value embedded in the forward link transmission with the comparator 228. The results of the comparison are used to determine whether the information subpacket carried on the forward packet data control channel is one time slot. If the locally generated CRC value matches the decoded CRC value embedded in the forward link transmission, the information subpacket is determined to be one time slot in length and the payload can be used by the processor 220 to decode the corresponding data subpacket. Conversely, if the locally generated CRC value does not match the decoded CRC value embedded in the forward link transmission, then the processor 220 releases two time slots worth of chips from the memory 218 for demodulation, decoding and CRC check functions. This process continues until the processor 220 finds a set of chips spanning over one, two, or four time slots in which the locally generated CRC value matches the decoded CRC value embedded in the forward link transmission.
