        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an electronic device whose electrodes and wiring are constructed by aluminum or a material containing aluminum as the principal component. It also relates to a method for manufacturing the same.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Recently, active-matrix liquid crystal devices equipped with large-area image planes are attracting much attention. Such active-matrix liquid crystal devices not only require image planes having larger area, but also demand for finer patterning.",
        "The use of a material having low electric resistance for the wiring material is necessary to fulfill the demand above, because the delay of signal propagating on wiring becomes a problem in a device with a size of 10\u00d710 inch2 or larger.",
        "Concerning a wiring material having low electric resistance, aluminum is the most desirable one. However, aluminum brings about the problem of heat resistance on its use in the manufacturing method (refer to a review paper in Display and Imaging, 4 (1996), pp. 199-206; published by Science Communications International).",
        "More specifically, in the steps such as the formation of various types of thin films by deposition and the annealing of the resulting films, or in the irradiation of laser light and the implantation of impurity ions, aluminum undergoes problematic abnormal growth so as to form protrusions called hillock or whisker. These hillock and whisker are believed to be attributable to the poor heat resistance of aluminum.",
        "Those protrusions known as hillock or whisker sometimes grow as long as 1 \u03bcm or even longer. This phenomenon leads to the occurrence of short circuit between wirings.",
        "The problem above can be prevented from occurring by forming an anodic oxide film on the surface of the aluminum wiring (see the reference above).",
        "According to the study of the present inventors, it is found that the anodic oxide film (assumably containing Al2O3 as the principal component) is robust and is effective for preventing hillock or whisker from generating. On the other hand, however, such a robust material makes it difficult to form contact holes on the aluminum wiring.",
        "In the light of the aforementioned circumstances, an object of the present invention is to overcome the problem of heat resistance of an aluminum wiring, and to provide a technique which solves the difficulty in forming contact holes on the aluminum wiring having an anodic oxide film formed thereon.",
        "According to one constitution of the present invention, there is provided an electronic device characterized in that it comprises a film pattern made of aluminum or a material containing aluminum as the principal component thereof, wherein the film made of aluminum or a material containing aluminum as the principal component contains oxygen atoms at a concentration of 8\u00d71018 atoms\u00b7cm\u22123 or less, carbon atoms at a concentration of 5\u00d71018 atoms\u00b7cm\u22123 or less, and nitrogen atoms at a concentration of 7\u00d71017 atoms\u00b7cm\u22123 or less.",
        "By employing the constitution above, the maximum height of the generated protrusions such as hillock and whisker can be suppressed to 500 \u212b or less.",
        "According to another constitution of the present invention, there is provided a method for manufacturing an electronic device comprising a film pattern made of aluminum or a material containing aluminum as the principal component thereof, wherein the film made of aluminum or a material containing aluminum as the principal component contains oxygen atoms at a concentration of 8\u00d71018 atoms\u00b7cm\u22123 or less, carbon atoms at a concentration of 5\u00d71018 atoms\u00b7cm\u22123 or less, and nitrogen atoms at a concentration of 7\u00d71017 atoms\u00b7cm\u22123 or less; and the film pattern is subjected to a process whose process temperature is 400\u00b0 C. or lower.",
        "By controlling the process temperature to 400\u00b0 C. or lower, it is possible to make the best of the effect of controlling the concentration of oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen atoms to a desired low level.",

        "FIGS. 9A to 9E schematically show devices utilizing liquid crystal panels.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1B, an embodiment of the present invention comprises forming a silicon nitride film 107 on the upper plane of a patterned aluminum film 106 containing 8\u00d71018 atoms\u00b7cm\u22123 or less of oxygen atoms, 5\u00d71018 atoms\u00b7cm\u22123 or less of carbon atoms, and 7\u00d71017 atoms\u00b7cm\u22123 or less of nitrogen atoms, and also forming anodic oxide films (oxide films) 108 and 109 on the side planes of the patterned aluminum film 106.",
        "By utilizing the constitution above, the formation of protrusions such as hillock and whisker can be suppressed, and contacts can be formed more easily.",
        "The present invention is described in detail referring to the preferred embodiments according to the present invention. It should be understood, however, that the present invention is not to be construed as being limited to the examples below.",
        "FIGS. 1A to 1C schematically show the fabrication process (cross section) of the present example. The present example refers to a fabrication process of a thin film transistor provided to the pixel matrix portion of an active matrix-type liquid crystal display (generally known as \u201cpixel transistor\u201d).",
        "Referring to FIG. 1A, a base film (not shown) is formed on the surface of a glass substrate 101. As the base film (not shown) for use in the present example, a 3,000-\u212b-thick silicon oxide film is formed by sputtering.",
        "The base film functions to relax the influence of the impurities diffused from the glass substrate and of the minute irregularities on the surface of the glass substrate. Although a glass substrate is used in this example, a quartz substrate can be used in the place thereof.",
        "After forming the base film on the glass substrate 1, a 500-\u212b-thick amorphous silicon film (not shown), which is the starting film for a semiconductor film that constitutes the active layer 102 of the thin film transistor, is formed by means of plasma CVD.",
        "The resulting amorphous silicon film is subjected to laser irradiation to obtain a crystalline silicon film (not shown). The crystalline silicon film is patterned to form an active layer pattern 102.",
        "Then, a 1,000-\u212b-thick silicon oxide film 103 which functions as a gate insulating film is formed by means of plasma CVD.",
        "Once the silicon oxide film 103 is obtained, an aluminum film 104 is formed at a thickness of 4,000 \u212b A by sputtering. A silicon nitride film 105 is on the aluminum film 104. Thus is obtained a state as is shown in FIG. 1A.",
        "In the present example, scandium is added into the aluminum film at a concentration of 0.18% by weight.",
        "The addition of scandium suppresses the generation of hillock and whisker in the later steps. Scandium is effective for the preventing hillock and whisker from generating, because it suppresses abnormal growth of aluminum.",
        "Then, a patterned aluminum denoted by a reference numeral 106 is obtained by patterning a layered film of aluminum film 104 and silicon nitride film 105. A silicon nitride film denoted by a reference numeral 107 remains on the gate electrode 106. That is, the patterned aluminum 106 becomes the gate electrode. A gate line is extended from the gate electrode 106.",
        "In the pixel matrix portion, the gate lines extended from the gate electrodes 106 are arranged in a lattice together with source lines to form a matrix.",
        "Anodic oxidation using the gate electrode 106 as the anode is performed thereafter to form anodic oxide films 108 and 109 on the thus exposed side planes of the aluminum film. The anodic oxide film are each provided at a thickness of 5 \u212b.",
        "In the anodic oxide step above, an ethylene glycol solution containing 3% of tartaric acid, which is neutralized by ammonia water, is used as the electrolytic solution. Thus, an anodic oxide film can be formed by applying electric current to platinum as a cathode and the aluminum film as an anode placed in the electrolytic solution.",
        "The anodic oxide film 108, 109 thus obtained is dense and robust. The film thickness of the film obtained in the anodic oxidation step can be controlled by adjusting the applied voltage.",
        "In the step above, an anodic oxide film is not formed on the upper plane of the gate electrode 106, because the electrolytic solution is brought into contact with only the side planes of the gate electrode 106. Thus is obtained a structure as is shown in FIG. 1B.",
        "A source region 110, a channel region 111, and a drain region 112 are formed thereafter by introducing phosphorus (P) by doping. Plasma doping is used in the present examples as a means of doping. A structure shown in FIG. 1C is thus obtained.",
        "Doping of P is performed in this case to fabricate an N-channel type thin film transistor. However, doping of boron (B) must be carried out to fabricate a P-channel type thin film transistor.",
        "The doping step produces such a condition as heating of the sample or inevitable heating of the sample. However, from the viewpoint of the heat resistance of aluminum, it is important to maintain the sample at a temperature of 400\u00b0 C. or lower. Care should be taken if the heating temperature exceeds 400\u00b0 C., because the generation of hillock (or whisker; these are not clearly distinguished from each other) becomes apparent.",
        "Upon completion of the doping step, laser light is irradiated to the resulting structure to activate the dopant and the doped region simultaneously.",
        "A 2,000-\u212b-thick silicon nitride film 113 is formed thereafter by means of plasma CVD to provide a first interlayer insulating film (FIG. 2A).",
        "A polyimide film 114 is formed thereafter by means of spin coating to provide a second interlayer insulating film. A planar surface can be obtained by using polyimide for the interlayer insulating film.",
        "Contact holes 115 and 116 for the source and drain regions are formed thereafter. Thus is obtained a structure as is shown in FIG. 2A.",
        "Then, a layered film consisting of titanium film, aluminum film, and titanium film in this order is formed by sputtering, and is patterned to obtain a source electrode 117 and a drain electrode 118. Thus is obtained a structure as is shown in FIG. 2B.",
        "A third interlayer insulating film 119 is formed by using polyimide. After forming a contact hole to the drain electrode 118 thereafter, an ITO pixel electrode 120 is formed. The resulting structure is shown in FIG. 2C.",
        "Thus, a complete thin film transistor is implemented by performing heat treatment under gaseous hydrogen to compensate for the defects that are present inside the active layer.",
        "The present example refers to a process to be carried out simultaneously with the fabrication process described in Example 1; more specifically, it relates to a process for manufacturing a thin film transistor to be equipped in a peripheral drive circuit that is formed in the periphery of the pixel matrix portion. The present example again describes a process for manufacturing an N-channel type thin film transistor.",
        "The steps in manufacturing the thin film transistor according to the present example are the same as those described in Example 1 with reference to FIGS. 1A to 1C (as a matter of course, there are some differences concerning the wiring pattern and the size of the active layer pattern).",
        "First, a structure with reference to FIG. 1C is obtained by following the steps described in Example 1. Then, referring to FIG. 3A, a silicon nitride film 113 is formed as a first interlayer insulating film.",
        "A polyimide layer 114 is formed as a second interlayer insulating film. Contact holes 301, 302, and 303 are formed thereafter.",
        "Because there is not anodic oxide film but a silicon nitride film formed on the upper plane of the gate electrode 106, the contact hole 302 can be formed easily thereon.",
        "In the constitution according to the present example, contact holes 301, 302, and 303 are formed at the same time by using dry etching. Thus is obtained a structure as is shown in FIG. 3A.",
        "A three-layered film consisting of titanium film, aluminum film, and titanium film is formed by sputtering. A source electrode 304, a gate lead electrode 305, and a drain electrode 306 are formed by patterning the resulting three-layered film. The structure shown in FIG. 3B is obtained in this manner.",
        "Then, a hydrogenation step similar to that described in Example 1 is performed to complete a thin film transistor.",
        "Steps for manufacturing an N-channel type thin film transistor are described in the description above. In general, an N-channel type thin film transistor and a P-channel type thin film transistor disposed in a complementary arrangement are used for a peripheral drive circuit.",
        "The present example refers to a process for manufacturing a thin film transistor comprising a low concentration impurity region interposed between a channel region and a drain region.",
        "FIGS. 4A to 4C and FIGS. 5A to 5C show the steps for manufacturing a thin film transistor according to the present example. First, a base film (not shown) is formed on the surface of a glass substrate 401. Then, an amorphous silicon film is formed, and is crystallized by irradiating a laser radiation. Thus is obtained a crystalline silicon film. The resulting crystalline silicon film is patterned to form an active layer 402 for the thin film transistor.",
        "Then, a silicon oxide film 403 which functions as a gate insulating film is formed, and an aluminum film 404 is formed thereafter.",
        "A silicon nitride film 405 is formed on the aluminum film. Thus is obtained a structure shown in FIG. 4A.",
        "An aluminum pattern 406 is obtained by applying patterning to the structure with reference to FIG. 4A. The resulting aluminum pattern is the base pattern of the gate electrode that is to be formed later. A remaining silicon nitride pattern is also shown by a reference numeral 407. Thus is obtained a structure as is shown in FIG. 4B.",
        "Anodic oxidation is performed thereafter to form anodic oxide films 409 and 410 by using the aluminum pattern 406 as the anode.",
        "In the present example, an aqueous 3% oxalic acid solution is used as the electrolytic solution. The anodic oxide film formed in this step is porous, and can be grown to a growth length of several micrometers. The growth length can be controlled by adjusting the duration of anodic oxidation. Thus is obtained a structure as is shown in FIG. 4C, in which the pattern 408 becomes the gate electrode.",
        "Then, anodic oxidation is performed again. In this case, anodic oxidation is performed under the same conditions as those employed in forming dense anodic oxide films in Example 1. Thus are obtained dense anodic oxide films 411 and 412 as shown in FIG. 5A.",
        "The dense anodic oxide films 411 and 412 are formed at a thickness of 500 \u212b. The dense anodic oxide films are formed selectively on the side planes of the gate electrode 408, because a silicon nitride film 407 is formed previously on the upper plane of the gate electrode 408. Furthermore, because the electrolytic solution permeates the porous anodic oxide films 409 and 410, dense anodic oxide films 411 and 412 are formed as shown in FIG. 5A.",
        "Phosphorus (P) atoms are implanted thereafter by employing plasma doping in the present example. Thus are formed a source region 413, an I-type region 414, and a drain region 415 in a self-aligned manner as is shown in FIG. 5B.",
        "Then, the porous anodic oxide films 409 and 410 are removed selectively. Referring to FIG. 5C, a part of the silicon nitride film 407 on the upper portion of the anodic oxide films 409 and 410 is removed together with the anodic oxide films.",
        "Subsequently, doping of P atoms is performed again. In the present step, the doping is carried out at a dose lower than that employed in the previous doping step. In the present step, low concentration impurity regions 416 and 418 are formed in a self-aligned manner, and a channel forming region 417 is also formed in a self-aligned manner.",
        "The low concentration impurity regions 416 and 418 contain phosphorus (P) at a concentration lower than that for the source region 413 or the drain region 415.",
        "In general, the low concentration impurity region 418 on the drain region side is called as \u201cLDD (lightly doped drain) region\u201d.",
        "Once a structure as shown in FIG. 5C is obtained, laser light is irradiated to thereby anneal the region subjected to doping.",
        "In the constitution described in the present example, the upper plane of the gate electrode (and the gate line extending therefrom) is covered by a silicon nitride film, and the side plane thereof is covered by a dense anodic oxide film. By employing such a constitution, the generation of hillock or whisker on the surface of the gate electrode can be suppressed during the steps of doping impurity and irradiating laser radiation. Moreover, in such a structure, contacts to gate electrodes (or gate lines) can be formed more easily.",
        "The present example refers to a thin film transistor of a so-called bottom-gate type constitution, in which the gate electrode is provided between the active layer and the substrate.",
        "FIGS. 6A to 6D and FIGS. 7A and 7B show the steps for manufacturing a thin film transistor according to the present example. First, a 3,000-\u212b-thick aluminum film 602 is formed on the surface of a glass substrate 601 by means of sputtering. The resulting aluminum film constitutes the gate electrode in the later steps.",
        "Once the aluminum film 602 is formed, a 500-\u212b-thick silicon nitride film 603 is formed thereon by plasma CVD. Thus is obtained a structure shown in FIG. 6A.",
        "A gate electrode 604 is formed thereafter by patterning. Silicon nitride film 605 remains on the gate electrode 604. The structure shown in FIG. 6B is obtained in this manner.",
        "Dense anodic oxide films 606 and 607 are each formed at a thickness of 500 \u212b by effecting anodic oxidation using the gate electrode 604 as the anode.",
        "Because silicon nitride film 605 still remains in this step, anodic oxide films are formed on only the side planes of the gate electrode 604. Thus is obtained a structure as shown in FIG. 6C.",
        "A 1,000-\u212b-thick silicon oxide film 608 which functions as a gate insulating film is formed thereafter by means of plasma CVD. In order to form an active layer, a 500-\u212b-thick amorphous silicon film (not shown) is formed by plasma CVD. A crystalline silicon film (not shown) is obtained thereafter by irradiating a laser light to the amorphous silicon film.",
        "Once the crystalline silicon film (not shown) is obtained, patterning is performed to form an active layer pattern comprising regions 609, 610, and 611.",
        "Then, a resist mask 612 is formed by performing exposure from the back side of the substrate 601 while using the gate electrode 604 as a mask (see FIG. 6D).",
        "In this state, plasma doping is performed to dope P atoms. Thus, a source region 609, a drain region 611, and a channel region 610 are formed in a self-aligned manner in the present doping step. Thus is obtained a structure shown in FIG. 6D.",
        "Upon completion of the doping step above, laser light is irradiated to the structure to activate the doped atoms and to anneal the doped regions.",
        "Then, a 2000-\u212b-thick silicon nitride film is formed by plasma CVD to provide a first interlayer insulating film 616, and a polyimide film is formed thereafter to obtain a second interlayer insulating film 613. The structure thus obtained is shown in FIG. 7A.",
        "After perforating contact holes, a source electrode 614 and a drain electrode 615 are formed. Hydrogenation is performed finally to complete the transistor.",
        "Although not shown, another contact to the gate electrode 604 is formed by perforating a contact hole on the upper portion of wiring extended from the gate electrode 604 in a separate portion. Thus is obtained a structure shown in FIG. 7B.",
        "Also in the constitution of the present example, hillock and whisker are prevented from generating as a whole because an anodic oxide film is formed on the side planes of the gate electrode 604 and because a silicon nitride film is formed on the upper plane of the gate electrode 604. Moreover, because a silicon nitride film is formed on the upper plane of the gate electrode, the formation of contact holes is facilitated.",
        "The relation between the concentration of impurities in an aluminum film containing 0.18% by weight of scandium and the generation of hillock is shown in this example. A 3,000-\u212b-thick aluminum film was formed by sputtering, and was subjected to heat treatment at 350\u00b0 C. for a duration of 1 hour under gaseous hydrogen atmosphere. Table 1 shows the relation between the observed height of the hillock and the concentration of impurities in the thus obtained film.",

        "Referring to Table 1, the concentration of impurities differs from a sample to another. The difference arises due to factors such as the varied duration of evacuation during sputtering, whether or not cleaning of chamber of the sputtering apparatus was performed, and how maintenance was carried out on the evacuation pump.",
        "The height of the hillock was determined by observation under cross section SEM (scanning electron microscope) and AFM (atomic force microscope). The concentration of impurity elements is given by the maximum value measured by using SIMS (secondary ion mass spectroscopy).",
        "It is apparent from Table 1 that the generation of hillock can be suppressed by decreasing the concentration of oxygen (O), carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) contained in the film.",
        "By taking into consideration the film thickness of the interlayer insulating film and the like, hillock not greater than 500 \u212b in height are allowable in view of practical use. Conclusively, Table 1 reads that the allowable concentration of the impurities is 7\u00d71018 atoms\u00b7cm\u22123 or lower for oxygen, 5\u00d71018 atoms\u00b7cm\u22123 or lower for carbon, and 7\u00d71017 atoms\u00b7cm\u22123 or lower for nitrogen.",
        "Care should be taken in using SIMS for the measurement of the impurity concentration, because a false value is sometimes measured in the vicinity of the interface of the film.",
        "The apparatus for use in an embodiment of the present invention is described below. FIG. 8 schematically shows the apparatus. Referring to FIG. 8, the apparatus is of a multi-chamber type in which a plurality of processes are performed continuously without exposing the sample to the atmosphere. Each of the chambers is equipped with the necessary evacuation system, and maintains the airtight environment.",
        "Referring to FIG. 8, the apparatus comprises a substrate feeding chamber 804 and a substrate discharging chamber 805. A plurality of substrates (samples) set in a cassette 815 are wholly fed into the substrate feeding chamber 804 from the outside. The substrates subjected to the process are set again in a cassette 816, and once process for a predetermined number of substrates are finished, the cassette 816 with such substrates is wholly drawn again from the chamber.",
        "A substrate transportation chamber 801 transports a substrate 800 to a desired chamber by using a robot arm 814.",
        "A chamber 803 is provided to form aluminum films by means of sputtering. The chamber 803 is equipped with a cryo pump to control the concentration of impurities in the aluminum film to a predetermined level or lower.",
        "A sputtering apparatus 802 is used to form a germanium (or silver) film to realize favorable electric contact in forming contacts. The chamber 802 is also equipped with a cryo pump to prevent the incorporation of impurities as much as possible.",
        "A chamber 807 is provided to perform heat treatment. In this chamber, heating is effected by irradiating a light emitted from a lamp.",
        "A chamber 806 is further provided to form a silicon nitride film by using plasma CVD.",
        "Gate valves, which are gate-type sections or partitions 810, 809, 808, 813, 812, and 811, are provided between the substrate transportation chamber 801 and each of the peripheral chambers for performing various types of processes.",
        "An example of operating the apparatus with reference to FIG. 8 is described below. The present operation comprises sequential processes of forming an aluminum film by film deposition, forming a germanium film, heat treatment, and forming a silicon nitride film.",
        "In the processes, the gate valves are all closed except for the one through which the sample is passed. First, a plurality of substrates (samples) for forming thereon an aluminum film are set inside a cassette 815, and are transported into the substrate feeding chamber 804. A substrate is then transported into the chamber 803 by using the robot arm 814.",
        "Upon completion of the formation of the aluminum film inside the chamber 803, the substrate is transferred to the chamber 806 to form thereon a silicon nitride film. Then, the substrate is placed inside the cassette 816 of the substrate discharging chamber 805 to complete the entire process.",
        "In case of forming an aluminum film for use as the contact after the formation of contact holes, a germanium film is formed inside the chamber 802 after forming the aluminum film in the chamber 803, and thereafter heat treatment is carried out in the heating chamber 807 to perform reflow treatment, i.e., the annealing for forming the contact.",
        "Reflow treatment provides a favorable electric contact between aluminum and the electrode to be brought into contact therewith (i.e., the electrode exposed at the bottom portion of the contact hole), because the melting point drops at the contact portion between aluminum and germanium, and germanium thereby diffuses into the aluminum film by the heat treatment.",
        "The present example relates to a case of employing, in the place of anodic oxidation, plasma oxidation for the formation of a metallic oxide film on the surface of aluminum. Plasma oxidation can be performed by effecting high frequency discharge under a reduced-pressure oxidizing atmosphere.",
        "The present invention disclosed in the present specification is applicable to an active matrix electro-optical device. Electro-optical devices include, for instance, a liquid crystal display device, an EL (electro-luminescent) display device, and an EC (electro-chromic) display device.",
        "Application examples of the commercially available products include TV cameras, personal computers, car navigation systems, TV projection systems, video cameras, etc. Those products are briefly described below with reference to FIGS. 9A to 9E.",

        "Referring to FIG. 9C, a car navigation system comprises a main body 2301, a display device 2302, operation switches 2303, and an antenna 2304. The display device 2302 is used as a monitor, but the main usage thereof is to display a map. Thus, the allowance in resolution is relatively large.",
        "Referring to FIG. 9D, a TV projection system comprises a main body 2401, a light source 2402, a display device 2403, mirrors 2404 and 2405, and a screen 2406. Because the image displayed in the display device 2403 is projected to the screen 2406, the display device 2403 must have high resolution.",
        "Referring to FIG. 9E, a video camera comprises a main body 2501, a display device 2502, an eye piece 2503, operation switches 2504, and a tape holder 2505. Since the real-time view of the photographed image can be seen through the eye piece 2503, a user may take pictures while viewing the image.",
        "As described above, by using the present invention, not only the problem concerning the heat resistance of an aluminum wiring is overcome, but also the problematic formation of contacts is facilitated in case an anodic oxidation film is formed.",
        "Although aluminum is used for the gate electrode and the gate line in the foregoing embodiments, the present invention is applicable to anodic oxidizable metals such as tantalum in place of aluminum.",
        "While the invention has been described in detail, it should be understood that the present invention is not to be construed as being limited thereto, and that any modifications can be made without departing from the scope of claims."
