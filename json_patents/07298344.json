No. 6,765,535 the teachings of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference and from which priority is hereby claimed.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to antennas. More specifically, the present invention relates to millimeter wave reflect array antennas and arrays thereof.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "As noted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE): \u201cThe millimeter-wave region of the electromagnetic spectrum is usually considered to be the range of wavelengths from 10 millimeters (0.4 inches) to 1 millimeter (0.04 inches). This means they are larger than infrared waves or x-rays, for example, but smaller than radio waves or microwaves. The millimeter-wave region of the electromagnetic spectrum corresponds to radio band frequencies of 30 GHz to 300 GHz and is sometimes called the Extremely High Frequency (EHF) range. The high frequency of millimeters waves as well as their propagation characteristics (that is, the ways they change or interact with the atmosphere as they travel) make them useful for a variety of applications including transmitting large amounts of computer data, cellular communications, and radar.\u201d See http://www.ieee-virtual-museum.org/collection/tech.php?id=2345917&lid=1.",
        "For current more demanding applications, such as \u2018active denial\u2019, higher power millimeter waves, i.e. waves in the range of tens to thousands of watts, are required. Prior attempts to produce high power millimeter wave energy with solid-state devices have included waveguide and microstrip power combining. At millimeter wave frequencies, this method of combining typically produces unsatisfactory results due to heavy losses in the waveguide and/or microstrip medium.",
        "Another approach involves the use of a spatial array. This approach has shown some promise. However, spatial arrays have not yet produced the power density levels that are required for the more demanding applications mentioned above.",
        "One current approach involves the use of a reflect array amplifier. The reflect array has unit cells, each containing its own input antenna, power amplifier, and output antenna. These unit cells are then configured into an array of arbitrary size. Reflect arrays overcome feed losses by feeding each element via a nearly lossless free-space transmission path.",
        "As disclosed and claimed in U.S. patent application entitled REFLECTIVE AND TRANSMISSIVE MODE MONOLITHIC MILLIMETER WAVE ARRAY SYSTEM AND IN-LINE AMPLIFIER USING SAME, filed Dec. 12, 2003 by K. Brown et al. (10/734445), the teachings of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference, reflect arrays differ from conventional arrays in that the input signal is delivered to the face of the array via free space, generally from a small horn antenna.",
        "An active reflect array consists of a large number of unit cells arranged in a periodic pattern. Each reflect array element is equipped with two orthogonally-polarized antennas, one for reception and one for transmission, and an amplifier therebetween. That is, reflect arrays typically receive one linear polarization and radiate the orthogonal polarization, i.e., the receive antenna receives only vertically-polarized radiation and the transmit antenna transmits only horizontally-polarized radiation.",
        "When integrated with the power-generating electronics on a thin semiconductor substrate, such antennas tend to have narrow bandwidths and high losses due to large surface currents. The size of each unit cell is constrained by the need to avoid grating lobes. For a fixed array with a main beam in the broadside direction, each unit cell may be no more than approximately 0.8 wavelengths on a side typically.",
        "Higher power levels are attained by combining the outputs of multiple transistors. The drawback of this approach is that the power combiners themselves take up valuable area on the semiconductor wafer that could otherwise be occupied by power-generating circuitry.",
        "Consequently, there was a need in the art for an improved system or method for generating a high power millimeter wave beam. Specifically, there was a need for a reflect array antenna capable of generating high power millimeter wave energy without significant loss.",
        "The need was addressed by copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/508,086 entitled AMPLIFIED PATCH ANTENNA REFLECT ARRAY, filed 22 Aug. 2006 by K. W. Brown the teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. Although this design addresses the need in the art, the array requires high current levels due to the parallel orientation of the amplifier columns in the array with respect to the direct current feed thereof. With multiple parallel columns in the array and potentially multiple chips, thousands of amps of DC current may be required. This requires high current cabling and tends to be lossy. This translates to higher power requirements, higher costs and more bulky arrays.",
        "Hence, a need remains in the art for further improvements systems and methods for generating high power millimeter wave beams. Specifically, a need remains for a reflect array antenna capable of generating high power millimeter wave energy with minimal DC current requirements.",
        "The need in the art is addressed by the reflect array antenna of the present invention. In the illustrative embodiment, the array includes a plurality of unit cells. Each cell includes a first dipole antenna having a first orientation and a first polarization; a second dipole antenna having a second orientation and a second polarization; and an amplifier input coupled inline to said first dipole antenna and output coupled inline to said second dipole antenna.",
        "In the illustrative array implementation, the array includes N first dipole antennas having a first orientation and a first polarization; M second dipole antennas having a second orientation and a second polarization; and a plurality of unit cells, each cell including an amplifier input coupled inline to a first dipole antenna and output coupled inline to a second dipole antenna. The second orientation and the second polarization are orthogonal to the first orientation and the first polarization.",
        "Each amplifier includes a transistor with an input terminal and first and second output terminals. Each input terminal is connected to the first dipole antenna and the output terminals are coupled to the second dipole antenna. The first and second terminals are adapted to be coupled to second and first terminals respectively of a neighboring cell in the array.",
        "In the illustrative implementation, each transistor is a HEMT (High Electron Mobility Transistor). A coupling capacitor is connected to one of the output terminals on a first end thereof. A feed forward path is connected between the input terminal and a second end of the coupling capacitor. In the best mode, a resistor and an inductor are connected in series in the feed forward path.",
        "In accordance with the invention, a direct current bias for the array is applied via the second dipole antenna. Input bias for the transistors is applied via the first dipole antenna. A unique gate bias voltage for each transistor in the array is provided on a row-by-row basis via a voltage divider network. The voltage divider network includes (N\u22121) first resistors Rb connected in series to a first source of supply potential, where N is the number of rows in the array. Each of the resistors is connected to provide an input voltage to one of the transistors in the array.

        "The array is fabricated by via a metallization pattern which is disposed on a first substrate to provide a chip. The chip is secured to a second substrate with a bonding agent. In the best mode, the bonding agent is an anisotropic electrically conductive bonding film that allows current to flow along a path orthogonal to a surface of the array while blocking current flow parallel to the surface of the array. The bonding agent is thermally conductive such that heat is transferred from the first substrate (containing the transistors) to the second substrate.",
        "In the best mode, the array is implemented using an Indium Phosphide (InP) metamorphic high-electron mobility transistor (MHEMT) process.",

        "FIG. 2 is a magnified view a portion of the array 10 of FIG. 1. In the illustrative array implementation, the array includes N input dipole antennas 201, 202, 203, . . . 20N, where N is the number of rows and M output dipole antennas 301, 302, 303, . . . 30M, where M is the number of columns. In the illustrative array of FIG. 1, the input dipole antennas are disposed in a horizontal (row) orientation and are therefor adapted to receive energy from a low power source (not shown) of a horizontal polarization. In the illustrative embodiment, the output dipole antennas are disposed in a vertical (column) orientation and are therefor adapted to output energy of a vertical polarization. In addition to the dipole antennas, the array 10 includes a plurality of unit cells 100.",
        "FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of a unit cell of the array 10 of FIG. 1. Here, a horizontally polarized input dipole feeds a transistor amplifier that, in turn, feeds a vertically polarized output dipole. Each cell includes an amplifier 110 input coupled inline to an input dipole antenna 20 and output coupled inline to an output dipole antenna 30. Each dipole antenna includes multiple elements. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the input dipole antennas 20i include left and right elements 22i and 24i, respectively, where \u2018i\u2019 is the row number. Likewise, the output dipole antennas 30j include top and bottom elements 32j and 34j, where \u2018j\u2019 is the column number.",
        "The transistor amplifier is in a common source configuration with the bottom output dipole leg DC isolated (with a capacitor) from the right input dipole leg as shown. Each amplifier 110 includes a transistor 120 with an input terminal 122 and first and second output terminals 124 and 126. In the illustrative implementation, each transistor is a field-effect transistor with gate, drain and source terminals 122, 124 and 126, respectively. The gate terminal 122 of each transistor 120 is connected to the left element 22 of the input dipole antenna 20, the drain terminal 124 is connected to the top element 32 of the output antenna 30 and source the terminal 126 is coupled to the bottom element 34 of the output dipole antenna 30.",
        "A gate bias resistor 128 is series connected to an inductor 130 in a feed forward path between the gate terminal 122 and the right element 24 of the input dipole antenna 20 at an amplifier output node 132. The gate resistor 128 should be large enough in order to appear as an RF open-circuit when connected to the transistor. The inductor 130 should be large enough to pass DC and block RF signals from the input terminal of the first cell to the input terminal of the next cell.",
        "A coupling capacitor 134 is connected between the source terminal of the transistor 120 and the amplifier output node 132. The coupling capacitor provides proper biasing for the transistor 120.",
        "Hence, each amplifier 110 is coupled to the input and output dipole antennas in an inline configuration. That is, each cell 100 is connected between the left, right, top and bottom halves of the input and output antenna elements. In the array, the right half of the input antenna for each cell in a row is the left half of the input antenna for the next adjacent cell to the right in the row. Likewise, the bottom half of the output dipole antenna for each cell in a column is the top half of the output dipole antenna for the next cell down in the column.",
        "Note that because of the unit cell topology, the drain voltage of each transistor amplifier is supplied by the output dipole legs, which are now interconnected along a particular column of the reflect array. Note also that because of this interconnection topology, each transistor amplifier of a particular column is connected in series (DC-wise) with all transistors in that column. This means that a much higher voltage can be utilized (than the standard 2-to-3 volts for MHEMT) on this chip, thus reducing the required current on the chip (which will lower the I-squared-R losses on the chip).",
        "Note also from the topology of FIG. 3, that since the input dipole antenna elements are all interconnected along a row of the array, the gates of each transistor amplifier are connected in parallel with respect to direct current (DC). This is made possible by the gate resistor 128 that interconnects the left and right input dipole elements and by the coupling capacitor 134, which isolates the gate bias from the drain bias. This allows the gate bias to be applied through the input dipole element chain. An illustrative biasing arrangement in accordance with the present teachings is set forth more fully below with reference to FIG. 1.",
        "FIG. 4 is a circuit layout of the unit cell of FIG. 3 implemented in MHEMT technology. As mentioned above, an MHEMT transistor is a metamorphic high-electron mobility transistor. In the best mode, the transistor is implemented in Indium Phosphide (InP) and fabricated on top of a Gallium Arsenide Wafer.",
        "FIG. 5 shows how the cell of FIG. 4 can be combined with other cells to provide an array of arbitrary size.",
        "Returning to FIG. 1, in accordance with the invention, a direct current bias for the array 10 is applied via the output dipole antennas 30. Gate bias for each of the transistors is applied via the input dipole antennas 20. A unique gate bias voltage for each transistor in the array is provided on a row-by-row basis via a voltage divider network 140. The voltage divider network 140 includes (N\u22121) first resistors Rb connected in series to a first source of supply potential, where N is the number of rows in the array 10. Each of the resistors is connected to provide an input voltage to one of the transistors in the array. The resistive network further includes M second resistors RL connected to a respective one of the second dipoles antennas, where M is the number of columns in the array.",
        "Each column is DC-interconnected along the top of the array with an applied a DC voltage. The bottom of each column of the array is also DC interconnected through load resistors RL and DC-grounded. The DC voltage applied at the top of the columns is set to NVd+Vg, where N is the number of rows in the array, Vd is the required drain-source voltage that needs to be applied across each transistor amplifier, and \u2212Vg is the required gate-source voltage that needs to be applied to each transistor amplifier. Note that the value of the load resistor RL at the bottom of each column is selected such to provide a voltage drop of Vg across the resistor.",
        "The gates of each transistor amplifier in the array are fed from the left side of the array as shown in FIG. 1. A voltage of (N\u22121)Vg is applied at the top row. Each row is separated by a small value of resistance much smaller than the gate bias interconnect resistor on each unit cell. This chain of resistors functions as a voltage divider. With this topology, the gate of each transistor amplifier is fed with a voltage of Vg below its source voltage (a requirement for HEMT technology). Note that the gate voltage of (N\u22121)Vg can be obtained from the drain voltage supply with a simple resistive network without departing from the scope of the present teachings.",
        "FIG. 6 shows an MHEMT implementation of an array using the cell of FIG. 4. Note that for this implementation, the chip should be mounted above a ground plane, separated by a substrate material.",
        "FIG. 7 is a side view of an illustrative embodiment of a chip for mounting a reflect antenna array in accordance with the present teachings. The array 10\u2032 is fabricated by via a metallization pattern 150 which is disposed on a first substrate 160 to provide a chip construction. The chip is secured to a second substrate 180 with a bonding agent 170. The second substrate 180 has the following potentially conflicting, requirements: 1) it should conduct heat well, 2) be somewhat transparent to radio frequency (RF) energy, and 3) provide the means to provide a DC path to the chip. For the thermal requirement, the chip must be mounted very flat against the substrate.",
        "Returning to FIG. 7, the second substrate 170 is an electrically insulative, thermally conductive dielectric substrate. The purpose of the substrate 170 is three fold. First, the substrate \u201cstands-off\u201d the ground plane from the dipole and allows the dipole to radiate efficiently. In fact, the dielectric constant of the substrate and its thickness can be used to \u201ctune\u201d the dipoles to the input and output impedance targets for the transistor amplifiers. Second, the substrate conducts heat from the transistors down to the ground plane and into a conventional heat sink 190 (e.g. made with copper or aluminum or liquid) mounted below (or as shown in FIG. 7, integral with) the ground plane. Third, the substrate provides via lines that feed the array chip with DC current. In this connection, note the chip vias 192 and 194, ground via 196 and bias via 198.",
        "The adhesive 170 should be thermally conductive but not interfere with RF energy. The adhesive should also be electrically conductive where the DC connections are (presumably at the edge of the chip away from the dipoles). If two separate adhesives are used (one non-conductive and one conductive), then they should be matched in thickness as much as possible.",
        "In the best mode, the bonding agent 170 is an anisotropic electrically conductive bonding film that allows current to flow along a path orthogonal to a surface of the array while blocking current flow parallel to the surface of the array.",
        "FIG. 8 is a cross-section of a bonding agent used in an illustrative embodiment of the invention. This type of adhesive film is manufactured by several companies including B-Tech Corp. This film has vertical conductive \u201cwires\u201d 200 that run through the thickness of the adhesive but do not touch each other. Since there is only conductivity in one direction (through the thickness), the adhesive should have little effect on the RF patterns of the dipole antennas. Since the \u201cwires\u201d in the adhesive pass directly from the chip to the substrate, the thermal properties of the adhesive film should be acceptable. Finally, the \u201cwires\u201d will also interconnect the DC pads of the chip down to the DC pads of the substrate. Since the direct current only flows in one direction, the drain, gate and ground voltages will all be isolated one from another. Hence, a sheet of this adhesive can be utilized to attach the chip to the substrate and still allow the substrate to perform all three of its functions outlined above.",
        "Consequently, the bonding agent should provide thermal conductivity and RF isolation. In the illustrative embodiment, the bonding agent had a thickness of 2 mils with standard thermal and electrical conductivity in the \u2018z\u2019 direction and standard electrical resistivity in the \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019 directions.
