        "This invention is directed to a display mitt for magnetic playing pieces for use as a teaching, method, and the like.",
        "It is well known within the educational community that interactive teaching is far better instructional method than the traditional lecturing and note taking method of teaching. Teachers strive to make their interactive teaching as effective and enjoyable as possible for their students. A wide variety of games have been developed specifically for the purpose of assisting teachers in teaching their students a variety of subjects. These games are used on a daily basis by teachers from the pre-kindergarten level to the senior executive MBA programs in this country. Several of these interactive teaching methods involve the use of playing pieces.",
        "Multiple types of playing pieces have been developed to assist in learning. Some of the types of playing pieces include stand-alone playing pieces, playing pieces with snap fasteners to attach to other objects, and magnetic playing pieces. Stand-alone pieces can be used in playing games and can include blocks, showing letters, colors, animals, etc. The playing pieces with snap fasteners and the magnetic playing pieces provide an additional advantage of allowing a user of the playing pieces to attach them to a second object to increase their learning experience. Magnetic playing pieces are far preferable for use with children due to the ease of use with magnetic playing pieces. Unlike snap fasteners, the magnetic playing pieces are attracted to forms of metal and attach to these other devices without much effort on the part of the student.",

In addition to the teaching advantages associated with wearing a mitt on the hand, the hand also may provide support to the first panel 10a so as to better support magnetic playing pieces including magnetic playing piece 16a. Display mitt 10 does not contain any magnets and does not attract metal pieces generally, rather, it contains a metallic layer for receiving magnetic playing pieces.",
        "The metallic layer located in both the first and second panels of the mitt may attract the magnetic playing pieces as a normal object containing metal would. Thus, when the magnetic playing piece is placed on to the mitt, it is attracted to the mitt due to the metallic sheet. The magnetic playing piece will thus remain in the same position on the mitt. Further, the magnetic playing piece may be removed with ease because of the relative weakness of magnetic attraction.",
        "Returning to the example described above, the teacher is trying to teach the student the alphabet. At this point in the lesson the teacher has placed magnetic playing piece 16a, which represents the letter O on the display mitt. She has asked student 14 to determine the next letter in the alphabet. Student 14 has chosen not to select magnetic playing piece 16b, which is the letter A which would be the incorrect choice. Student 14 has chosen the correct answer by picking up playing piece 16c, which is the letter P.",

        "Referring now to FIG. 6, a bottom view of the mitt is shown sectionally. Hand receiving space 70 is formed by attaching said first panel 72 to second panel 74. The hand receiving space may allow a user to wear the mitt to enhance the teaching or game playing associated with the mitt. Further, the hand of a wearer of the mitt may provide additional support for the metallic layers to receive magnetic playing pieces associated with teaching or playing a game. First panel 72 may have a flexible metallic layer 76 that may be covered by exterior layers 78 and 80. Second panel 74 may have a flexible metallic layer 82 that may be covered by exterior layers 84 and 86.",
        "The mitt may be used as a teaching aid or as an aid to playing a game. In order to use this mitt in such a manner, it should be either worn by a teacher or provided to a student for wearing. Once provided to a student for wearing, the student should place their hand in the mitt so that their hand is disposed between the panels to provide support for receiving magnetic playing pieces. The student should then be provided with a plurality of magnetic playing pieces. These magnetic playing pieces may include letters of the alphabet, colors, shapes, animals, words, maps, household items, and all other types of magnetic playing pieces associated with playing games or teaching. In response to a request by the teacher, the student should select a magnetic playing piece and place it on the mitt. If the student places the incorrect playing piece on the mitt, the teacher should correct the student and have them place the proper magnetic playing piece on the mitt. In response to a further command, the student should place further magnetic playing pieces on the mitt. Later, the student may be asked to remove the playing pieces from the mitt in response to a request. The student should remove the piece in response to this request and leave the remaining magnetic pieces on the mitt.",
        "The games that can be played and teaching that can be done using the mitt include matching games. In matching games, set of magnetic playing pieces are provided to the student. Within the set of magnetic pieces there are multiple pairs of matching magnetic playing pieces. The magnetic playing pieces may take on the form of colors, animals, shapes, etc. Once one of the pieces is placed on the mitt, the student must search through the remaining playing pieces to find the playing piece that matches the prior selected piece. Once the student places the second playing piece on the mitt, the teacher should determine if the proper pieces have been placed. The teacher determines whether or not the proper piece has been placed by looking to see if the two pieces match. If the two pieces match, the teacher should congratulate the student and provide positive reinforcement for completing the task properly. Should the pieces not match, the teacher should correct the student and ask the student to try to match the piece again properly. Social skills games may be played using the mitt using magnetic playing pieces that represent feelings. The magnetic playing pieces provided in this game represent feelings and emotions. For example, the playing pieces may be faces that are frowning to represent disappointment or anger, smiling to represent happiness, crying to represent sadness, etc. The students can be read a story, or simply told a sentence that involves or evokes emotion. Upon reading the story or the sentence, the student should be prompted to select a playing piece and place it on the display mitt representing either their emotion, or the emotions of a character in the story or sentence. If the story clearly shows that the character is sad, and the student selects a smiley face playing piece, the teacher should discuss this selection with the student. The student should be taught that in a situation where an individual is sad, they usually do not smile, rather they are more apt to cry. Upon teaching the student this, the student should be able to correctly select the playing piece representing the crying character to represent this feeling.",
        "A song may be taught to a student by placing a magnetic picture on the mitt to identify the chorus of a song. When the chorus should occur, the teacher should raise their hand while wearing the mitt to cue the students to sing.",
        "The mitt can be used in a story continuation format where the students would place magnetic pieces on the mitt to create a story. The magnetic pieces could be characters, emotions, objects that the characters encounter, etc.",
        "By placing multiple playing pieces on the mitt, a story is created based on characters, the objects they encounter, and the emotions they feel. For example, a magnetic piece representing a student can be placed on the mitt representing the fact that a student is the character in the story. Then a playing pieces representing a puppy can be placed on the mitt representing the fact that the student encounters the puppy. Finally, a smiling face playing piece may be placed on the mitt representing the emotion felt by the student upon finding the dog. Thus, the student has created a sentence or story saying that a student met a puppy and was happy. For example, the magnetic playing pieces could represent articles of clothing. Multiple hats, including baseball hats, cowboy hats and ski hats may be placed on the mitt. Further, a piece that doesn't belong with the hat category such as shoes, can also be placed on the mitt. The teacher would instruct the student to remove the piece that does not long belong with the other magnetic pieces. The mitt may be used for teaching classifying through playing a classifying game. Multiple magnetic pieces representing various objects can be placed on the mitt. The student would then choose the piece that does not belong with the other magnetic pieces. The student would then remove that piece from the mitt. If the student selects the shoes, they have obviously selected the piece that does not belong with the headgear pieces shown. The teacher should provide positive reinforcement to the student for making the correct choice. If the student selects the wrong piece, one of the headgear rather than the shoes, the teacher should discuss this choice with the student, and teach them that the shoes do not belong with the other items because the other items are all items worn on the head of a person.",
        "The examples above, including the alphabet examples, are a few examples of the many open-ended uses for the mitt. Any type of game or learning activity involving magnetic playing pieces that would fit on the mitt could be played using the mitt.",
