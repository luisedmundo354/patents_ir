        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a broadband wireless access (BWA) communication system, and more particularly to a system and a method for performing a soft handover.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "In the 4th generation (4G) communication system, which is the next generation communication system, extensive research is being conducted to provide users with services having various Qualities-of-Service (QoSs) at high speeds. In the current 4G communication system, extensive research is being conducted to develop a new type of communication system ensuring the mobility of a mobile station (MS) and a QoS in a BWA communication system such as a wireless Local Area Network (LAN) system and a wireless Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) system capable of supporting relatively high transmission speeds. Representatives of such communication systems are the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16a communication system and the IEEE 802.16e communication system.",
        "The IEEE 802.16a/d-based communication system and the IEEE 802.16e-based communication system use an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)/orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) scheme for a physical channel of the WMAN system in order to support a broadband transmission network. The IEEE 812.16a communication system is a single structure system that does not reflect the mobility of a Subscriber Station (SS) at all, in which the SS is in a stationary state. In contrast, the IEEE 812.16e-based communication system is a system realized by supplementing the IEEE 812.16a-based communication system with the ability to handle the mobility of an SS. Hereinafter, a mobile SS will be referred to as a MS. Accordingly, in the IEEE 812.16e-based communication system, the study of handover according to the mobility of the MS is being activated.",
        "Handover refers to an operation enabling smooth provision of services to an MS which is moving between base stations (BSs). Such handover may have two schemes (a hard handover scheme and a soft handover scheme). The hard handover scheme and the soft handover scheme will be described.",
        "The hard handover scheme denotes a scheme through which, when an MS moves between base stations, the MS releases a channel setup with an anchor base station (a serving base station currently providing a service to the MS) and sets up a channel with an active non-anchor base station (a target base station) in the shortest period of time, so that the service may be continuously provided. The serving base and the target base station will be referred to as an anchor base station and an active non-anchor base station, respectively, for the purpose of description. The hard handover causes a ping-pong phenomenon of continuously alternating channel release and setup when channel states are continuously inferior, for example, when the MS moves across a cell boundary region.",
        "The soft handover scheme denotes a scheme through which, when an MS moves between base stations, the MS has channels set up with both an anchor base station and an active non-anchor base station, is relocated in the non-anchor base station while simultaneously receiving signals from both the anchor base station and the non-anchor base station through the setup channel, and then releases the channel from the anchor base station, so that the service is continuously provided. Accordingly, when the MS performs a handover operation through the soft handover scheme, the MS receives downlink signals from a plurality of base stations (i.e. the anchor base station and the non-anchor base station) and improves quality of the received downlink signals by combining the downlink signals received from the base stations.",
        "The signal combining scheme may be classified into a soft combining scheme and a selection diversity scheme.",
        "The soft combining scheme is a scheme of demodulating each of the signals received from a plurality of base stations and combining the signals in a front end of a channel decoder. The selection diversity scheme is a scheme of de-modulating and channel-decoding each of the signals received from a plurality of base stations and then selecting a signal with the best quality from among the channel-decoded signals.",
        "The MS performing a handover operation through the soft handover scheme may obtain a soft combining gain by simultaneously receiving signals through channels set up with both the anchor base station and the non-anchor base station. In order to obtain the combining gain, the MS must receive information regarding channels (channel allocation information) set up with both the anchor base station and the non-anchor base station and receive signals from the anchor base station and the non-anchor base station using the channel allocation information.",
        "However, in the typical broadband wireless access system (e.g., the IEEE 812.16e-based communication system), it is difficult for the MS to receive channel allocation information of an active non-anchor base station because an anchor base station reports only information regarding a channel allocated by the anchor base station.",

        "The MS detects a preamble sequence from the active non-anchor base station so as to obtain synchronization with the active non-anchor base station in step 1211. The MS determines if a soft handover operation is currently performed in step 1213. If the soft handover operation is being performed, the MS demodulates and decodes MAP messages so as to detect the HO CID Translation MAP IE, the DL-MAP IE, the UL-MAP IE, the HO Anchor Active DL MAP IE, and the HO Anchor Active UL MAP IE in step 1215. In step 1217, the MS detects \u2018Anchor Preamble\u2019 and \u2018Anchor CID\u2019 included in the HO Anchor Active DL MAP IE and the HO Anchor Active UL MAP IE. It is necessary to detect the Anchor preamble and the Anchor CID so that the MS may distinguish data burst transmitted/received from/to the anchor base station as described above. However, if the active non-anchor base station uses a CID identical to the Anchor CID used in the anchor base station, it is impossible for the MS to transmit/receive data burst from/to the anchor base station because CIDs are intrinsically assigned according to base stations.",
        "Accordingly, in step 1219, the MS detects the Non-Anchor CID based on the detected HO CID Translation MAP IE. As a result, the MS detects the Non-Anchor CID from the anchor base station, so that the MS can transmit/receive data burst having Anchor CID corresponding to the Non-Anchor CID. In step 1221, the MS transmits/receives data burst from/to both the anchor base station and the active non-anchor base station correspondingly to the detected HO CID Translation MAP IE, the DL-MAP IE, the UL-MAP IE, the HO Anchor Active DL MAP IE, and the HO Anchor Active UL MAP IE, and then terminates the operation of performing soft handover.",
        "As described above, according to the present invention, new MAP IEs are embodied in the IEEE 812.16e-based communication system, thereby enabling soft handover of the MS. As a result, the soft handover of the MS improves signal receiving quality of the MS and removes the ping-pong phenomenon caused in had handover, thereby improving the performance of an entire system.",
        "While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Consequently, the scope of the invention should not be limited to the embodiments, but should be defined by the appended claims and equivalents thereof."
