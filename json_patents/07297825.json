        "This invention relates to a catalyst for producing a liquefied petroleum gas containing propane or butane as a main component by reacting carbon monoxide with hydrogen.",
        "This invention also relates to a process for producing a liquefied petroleum gas containing propane or butane as a main component from a synthesis gas using the catalyst. This invention also relates to a process for producing a liquefied petroleum gas containing propane or butane as a main component from a carbon-containing starting material such as a natural gas using the catalyst.",
        "Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is a liquefied petroleum-based or natural gas-based hydrocarbon which is gaseous at ambient temperature under atmospheric pressure by compression while optionally cooling, the main component being propane or butane. LPG is advantageously stored or transported in liquid form. Thus, in contrast with a natural gas that requires a pipeline for supply, it can be filled in a container to be supplied to any place. For this reason, LPG comprising propane as a main component, i.e., propane gas has been widely used as a fuel for household and business use. At present, propane gas is supplied to about 25 million households (more than 50% of the total households) in Japan. In addition to household and business use, LPG is used as a fuel for a portable product such as a portable gas burner and a disposable lighter (mainly, butane gas), an industrial fuel and an automobile fuel.",
        "Conventionally, LPG has been produced by 1) collection from a wet natural gas, 2) collection from a stabilization (vapor-pressure regulating) process of crude petroleum, 3) separation and extraction of a product in, for example, a petroleum refining process, or the like.",
        "LPG, in particular propane gas used as a household/business fuel, can be expected to be in great demand in the future. Thus, it may be very useful to establish an industrially practicable and new process for producing LPG.",
        "As a process for producing LPG, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 61-23688 discloses that a synthesis gas consisting of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is reacted in the presence of a mixed catalyst obtained by physically mixing a methanol synthesis catalyst such as a Cu\u2014Zn-based catalyst, a Cr\u2014Zn-based catalyst and a Pd-based catalyst, specifically a CuO\u2014ZnO\u2014Al2O3 catalyst or a Pd/SiO2 catalyst with a methanol conversion catalyst composed of a zeolite having an average pore size of about 10 \u212b (1 nm) or more, specifically a Y-type zeolite, to give a liquefied petroleum gas or a mixture of hydrocarbons similar in composition to LPG.",
        "In terms of the zeolite catalyst, the above-mentioned Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 61-23688 describes that the distribution of hydrocarbons produced significantly depends on the pore size of the zeolite, and that when a zeolite having a larger pore size (Y-type zeolite) is used, lower paraffins of C1 to C6, particularly C2 to C4, are produced with a high selectivity while controlling production of aromatic hydrocarbons. In terms of the zeolite catalyst, the above-mentioned Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 61-23688 also describes that although it has a restriction for a pore size, any type of zeolite catalyst meeting the condition can be applied, irrespective of variation in a molecular structure or micropore structure or a variety of preparation treatments. Meanwhile, in terms of a methanol synthesis catalyst, the above-mentioned Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 61-23688 describes that a variety of simple substances and composites of a metal or a metal-oxide can be used if they have the ability to hydrogenate.",
        "Furthermore, the above-mentioned Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 61-23688 also describes that acidity of a zeolite can be increased by dealumination, and thereby the yield of hydrocarbons (lower paraffins) can be improved, from the comparison between the reaction results using a mixed catalyst comprising a dealuminated Y-type zeolite with SiO2/Al2O3=7.6 as a methanol conversion catalyst and the reaction results using a mixed catalyst comprising a non-dealuminated Y-type zeolite with SiO2/Al2O3=5.1.",
        "The catalyst described in the above-mentioned Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 61-23688, however, does not necessarily show sufficient performance.",
        "For example, a catalyst consisting of Pd/SiO2 and a Y-type zeolite is less active and gives a lower yield of a hydrocarbon, in which a ratio of propane (C3) and butane (C4) is lower. A catalyst consisting of Pd/SiO2 and a dealuminated Y-type zeolite with SiO2/Al2O3=7.6 treated with steam at 450\u00b0 C. for 2 hours has a higher activity and gives a higher yield of a hydrocarbon, in which a ratio of propane (C3) and butane (C4) is higher, but it may not have sufficient performance particularly in terms of activity and yield of a hydrocarbon. Moreover, in general, a catalyst consisting of Pd/SiO2 and a Y-type zeolite may be significantly deteriorated with time, and thus, it may not have a sufficiently long catalyst life.",
        "On the other hand, as a general trend, a catalyst consisting of a Cu\u2014Zn-based catalyst (a copper-zinc-alumina mixed oxide and a commercially available catalyst for methanol synthesis at a low pressure) and a Y-type zeolite has a higher activity and gives a higher yield of a hydrocarbon, in which a ratio of propane (C3) and butane (C4) is higher, in comparison with a catalyst consisting of Pd/SiO2 and a Y-type zeolite. Among them, a catalyst consisting of a Cu\u2014Zn-based catalyst and a dealuminated Y-type zeolite with SiO2/Al2O3=7.6 treated with steam at 450\u00b0 C. for 2 hours has a high activity and gives a high yield of a hydrocarbon, in which a ratio of propane (C3) and butane (C4) is high. However, a catalyst consisting of a Cu\u2014Zn-based catalyst and a Y-type zeolite may be significantly deteriorated with time, and thus, it may not have a sufficiently long catalyst life in general. It is, therefore, difficult to stably produce LPG in a high yield for a long period using the catalyst.",
        "Thus, it has been needed further improvement of a catalyst for producing a liquefied petroleum gas in order to practically use a process for producing LPG from a synthesis gas and a process for producing LPG from a carbon-containing starting material such as a natural gas.",
        "As a process for producing LPG, \u201cSelective Synthesis of LPG from Synthesis Gas\u201d, Kaoru Fujimoto et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 58, p. 3059-3060 (1985) discloses that a hybrid catalyst consisting of a methanol synthesis catalyst such as a 4 wt % Pd/SiO2, a Cu\u2014Zn\u2014Al mixed oxide {Cu:Zn:Al=40:23:37 (atomic ratio)} or a Cu-based low-pressure methanol synthesis catalyst (Trade name: BASF S3-85) and a high-silica Y-type zeolite with SiO2/Al2O3=7.6 treated with steam at 450\u00b0 C. for 1 hour can be used to produce C2 to C4 paraffins in a selectivity of 69 to 85% via methanol and dimethyl ether from a synthesis gas. However, as is for the catalyst described in the above-mentioned Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 61-23688, the catalyst described in the reference may not show sufficient performance.",
        "In addition, \u201cSynthesis of LPG from Synthesis Gas with Hybrid Catalyst\u201d, Qianwen Zhang et al., Dai 33 Kai Sekiyu Sekiyu Kagaku Toronkai Koen Yoshi (the summaries of the 33th Petroleum and Petrochemistry Discussion), p. 179-180, Nov. 17, 2003 discloses that a hybrid catalyst consisting of Pd\u2014SiO2 or Pd, Ca\u2014SiO2 and a zeolite can be used to produce LPG from a synthesis gas.",
        "An objective of this invention is to provide a less deteriorative catalyst for producing a liquefied petroleum gas with a longer catalyst life, which can produce a hydrocarbon containing propane or butane as a main component, i.e., a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), by reacting carbon monoxide and hydrogen, with high activity, high selectivity and high yield.",
        "Another objective of this invention is to provide a process for stably producing LPG with a high concentration of propane and/or butane from a synthesis gas in a high yield for a long period, using the catalyst. A further objective of this invention is to provide a process for stably producing LPG with a high concentration of propane and/or butane from a carbon-containing starting material such as a natural gas in a high yield for a long period.",
        "The present invention provides a catalyst for producing a liquefied petroleum gas, which is used for producing a liquefied petroleum gas containing propane or butane as a main component by reacting carbon monoxide and hydrogen, comprising",

        "Herein, \u201csynthesis gas\u201d means a mixed gas comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and is not limited to a mixed gas consisting of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. A synthesis gas may be, for example, a mixed gas comprising carbon dioxide, water, methane, ethane, ethylene and so on. A synthesis gas produced by reforming a natural gas generally contains, in addition to hydrogen and carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water vapor. A synthesis gas may be a coal gas produced by coal gasification or a water gas produced from a coal coke.",
        "A catalyst for producing a liquefied petroleum gas according to this invention comprises a Pd-based methanol synthesis catalyst as a methanol synthesis catalyst component and \u03b2-zeolite as a zeolite catalyst component. The catalyst for producing a liquefied petroleum gas according to this invention can produce a hydrocarbon containing propane or butane as a main component, i.e., a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) with high activity, high selectivity and a high yield, by reacting carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and has a longer catalyst life with less deterioration.",
        "By reacting carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of the catalyst according to this invention, the reaction represented by the following formula (1) may proceed to give LPG containing propane or butane as a main component.",
        "",
        "First, on the methanol synthesis catalyst component, methanol is formed from carbon monoxide and hydrogen, while dimethyl ether is also formed by dehydro-dimerization of methanol. Then, methanol thus formed is converted to a lower-olefin hydrocarbon comprising propylene or butene as a main component at an active site in a pore in the zeolite catalyst component. In the reaction, methanol would be dehydrated to give a carbene (H2C:), which is subjected to polymerization to give a lower olefin. The lower olefin thus generated is released from the pore in the zeolite catalyst component and is rapidly hydrogenated on the methanol synthesis catalyst to give a paraffin comprising propane or butane as a main component, i.e., LPG.",
        "Herein, a \u201cmethanol synthesis catalyst component\u201d means a compound which can act as a catalyst in the reaction of CO+2H2\u2192CH3OH. And a \u201czeolite catalyst component\u201d means a zeolite which can act as a catalyst in a condensation reaction of methanol into a hydrocarbon and/or a condensation reaction of dimethyl ether into a hydrocarbon.",
        "As a methanol synthesis catalyst, a Cu\u2014Zn-based catalyst (a composite oxide containing Cu and Zn) and a Zn\u2014Cr-based catalyst (a composite oxide containing Zn and Cr) are widely used. However, sufficient catalyst performance cannot be always achieved when using, in place of a Pd-based methanol synthesis catalyst, a Cu\u2014Zn-based methanol synthesis catalyst or a Zn\u2014Cr-based methanol synthesis catalyst as a methanol synthesis catalyst component in a catalyst for producing a liquefied petroleum gas in production of LPG by reacting carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Furthermore, sufficient catalyst performance cannot be always achieved when using a zeolite other than \u03b2-zeolite (for example, a Y-type zeolite) as a zeolite catalyst component in case a Pd-based methanol synthesis catalyst is used as a methanol synthesis catalyst component in a catalyst for producing a liquefied petroleum gas.",
        "The reaction of carbon monoxide and hydrogen for producing LPG depends on a variety of factors. Therefore, the reason why the catalyst for producing a liquefied petroleum gas of this invention exhibits excellent performance is not clear, but the followings might be assumed.",
        "A reaction of carbon monoxide and hydrogen for forming methanol (CO+2H2\u2192CH3OH) is an equilibrium reaction. And, the equation: CO+2H2=CH3OH+100 kJ indicates that the equilibrium of methanol formation is more advantageous as a temperature is lower. However, when reacting carbon monoxide and hydrogen to produce LPG, methanol formed on a methanol synthesis catalyst component is rapidly converted to a lower-olefin hydrocarbon at an active site in a pore in the zeolite catalyst component. There are, therefore, substantially no restrictions to the equilibrium of methanol formation. Thus, it is not necessarily required to conduct the reaction at a lower temperature for achieving a sufficiently high yield. On the other hand, it is advantageous to conduct the reaction at a higher temperature in terms of a reaction rate. In the light of activity of the zeolite catalyst component, it is desirable that the methanol synthesis catalyst component has great heat-resistance to some degree. Specifically, the methanol synthesis catalyst can be used preferably at 270\u00b0 C. or higher, more preferably 300\u00b0 C. or higher, further preferably 320\u00b0 C. or higher.",
        "Among methanol synthesis catalysts, a Cu\u2014Zn-based catalyst is generally used at a relatively lower temperature (about 230 to 300\u00b0 C.) and its heat resistance is not so higher than other methanol synthesis catalysts. When producing LPG by reacting carbon monoxide and hydrogen at an elevated temperature for achieving higher activity and higher yield, it is not necessarily preferable to use a conventional Cu\u2014Zn-based catalyst as a methanol synthesis catalyst component.",
        "On the other hand, among methanol synthesis catalysts, a Zn\u2014Cr-based catalyst is generally used at a relatively higher temperature (about 250 to 400\u00b0 C.). There does not appear to be a particular problem in using a Zn\u2014Cr-based catalyst as a methanol synthesis catalyst component when making a reaction temperature higher.",
        "However, when producing LPG by reacting carbon monoxide and hydrogen, a methanol synthesis catalyst component is required to act as a catalyst in a hydrogenation reaction of an olefin into a paraffin. A conventional Zn\u2014Cr-based catalyst does not, however, have sufficient hydrogenating ability. Thus, when producing LPG by reacting carbon monoxide and hydrogen, it is not necessarily preferable to use a conventional Zn\u2014Cr-based catalyst as a methanol synthesis catalyst component.",
        "A Pd-based methanol synthesis catalyst, which is used as a methanol synthesis catalyst component in this invention, is known to act as a catalyst in the methanol synthesis reaction (CO+2H2\u2192CH3OH), but it is not widely used as a methanol synthesis catalyst. However, in the light of its high thermal stability and hydrogenating ability, it is suitable as a methanol synthesis catalyst component in a catalyst used in producing a liquefied petroleum gas by reacting carbon monoxide and hydrogen, particularly at an elevated reaction temperature.",
        "As a methanol synthesis catalyst component, it is particularly preferable to use a catalyst in which 0.1 to 10 wt % Pd is supported on a silica support having a specific surface area of 420 m2/g or more.",
        "Examples of a zeolite catalyst component used in combination with a Pd-based methanol synthesis catalyst include various zeolites such as Y-type, ZSM-5, mordenite, SAPO-34 and MCM-22 zeolites, but all of the zeolites cannot give a catalyst with excellent performance. Although the reason is not clear, a catalyst for producing a liquefied petroleum gas exhibiting prominently excellent performance can be obtained in case that a methanol synthesis catalyst component is a Pd-based methanol synthesis catalyst and a zeolite catalyst component is \u03b2-zeolite. A Y-type zeolite is preferably a zeolite catalyst component in combination with a Cu\u2014Zn-based catalyst, but is less preferable than \u03b2-zeolite as a zeolite catalyst component used in combination with a Pd-based methanol synthesis catalyst.",
        "As a zeolite catalyst component, a middle-pore zeolite (a zeolite with a pore size of 0.44 to 0.65 nm formed mainly by a 10-membered ring) or large-pore zeolite (a zeolite with a pore size of 0.66 to 0.76 nm formed mainly by a 12-membered ring) where pores into which reactant molecules can diffuse three-dimensionally extend; in other words, where reactant molecules three-dimensionally diffuse in pores, for example, ZSM-5, MCM-22, \u03b2- and Y-type zeolites may be preferable. As a zeolite catalyst component, a so-called high-silica zeolite may be preferable; specifically, a zeolite with a SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of 10 to 150. When a high silica zeolite having active sites in a lower density in which diffusion of reactant molecules is limited is used as a zeolite catalyst component, a polymerization reaction completes with a lower polymerization degree, giving a lower olefin comprising propylene or butene as a main component. The lower olefin thus produced can be easily released from a pore in the zeolite catalyst component, which is relatively larger and three-dimensionally extends, allowing a reactant molecule to diffuse. Then, the olefin is rapidly hydrogenated on the methanol synthesis catalyst component to become inactivated in further polymerization and thus to be stabilized. Use of the above component as a zeolite catalyst component makes it possible to produce propylene and/or butene and to produce propane and/or butane with a higher selectivity.",
        "However, an important factor for a zeolite catalyst component may not be limited to a pore size and a SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio. Other factors such as an acid strength, a pore structure and a crystal size may be also important for a zeolite catalyst component. Performance of a catalyst for producing a liquefied petroleum gas, particularly its activity and LPG selectivity, strongly depends on the balance among three parameters, the ability of a methanol synthesis catalyst component to form methanol, the ability of a methanol synthesis catalyst component to hydrogenate an olefin into a paraffin, and the ability of a zeolite catalyst component to form a hydrocarbon from methanol, and they are thought to be influenced by a variety of factors.",
        "As a zeolite catalyst component, it is particularly preferable to use a proton type \u03b2-zeolite with a SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of 10 to 150.",
        "Furthermore, a catalyst for producing a liquefied petroleum gas according to the present invention has a longer catalyst life and is less deteriorated with time. The catalyst for producing a liquefied petroleum gas according to this invention can produce propane and/or butane, i.e., LPG with high activity and high yield for a longer period, in comparison with, for example, a catalyst comprising a Cu\u2014Zn-based methanol synthesis catalyst and Y-type zeolite or a catalyst comprising a Pd-based methanol synthesis catalyst and a Y-type zeolite. A catalyst for producing a liquefied petroleum gas comprising a Cu\u2014Zn-based methanol synthesis catalyst as a methanol synthesis catalyst component is relatively unstable in a reaction atmosphere having higher concentrations of CO2 and H2O at high-temperature. On the other hand, a Y-type zeolite is thermally less stable than \u03b2-zeolite. Improving stability and extending life of a catalyst are very important for practical application of a process for producing LPG from a synthesis gas and a process for producing LPG from a carbon-containing starting material such as a natural gas.",
        "A nickel catalyst, for example, is widely used as a catalyst in a hydrogenation reaction of an olefin into a paraffin. But if a substance cannot act as a catalyst in a methanol synthesis reaction (CO+2H2\u2192CH3OH), it is, of course, unpreferable as a methanol synthesis catalyst component used in this invention.",
        "The reaction conditions are also important for stably producing LPG for a long period with a high conversion, a high selectivity and a high yield by reacting carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst for producing a liquefied petroleum gas of this invention. This invention may be particularly effective when carbon monoxide and hydrogen are reacted at a reaction temperature of 300\u00b0 C. to 420\u00b0 C.
