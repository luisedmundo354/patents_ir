        "This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/JP03/05564, filed May 1, 2003.",
        "The present invention relates to a signal processing apparatus, a signal processing method, a program and a recording medium used when frame rate conversion is performed.",
        "Methods of performing frame rate conversion by performing, on a film image, 2:3 pulldown to NTSC or conversion from NTSC to PAL and methods of performing such frame rate conversion with efficiency have been proposed to a large extent.",
        "These methods are characterized in that the image length before conversion and the image length after conversion are the same because frame insertion or thinning-out is performed so that the number of frames is changed before and after conversion.",
        "On the other hand, a method is known where the image length is different between before and after conversion because frame insertion or thinning-out is not performed and the number of frames is not changed between before and after conversion (frame rate conversion method where an image after conversion is either slow motion or fast-forward of an image before conversion).",
        "For example, a system has been proposed that realizes a smooth 1/2.5 slow-motion playback by converting an image shot at a frame rate of 60 frames per second into an image of 24 frames per second.",
        "Moreover, a variable-speed frame rate shooting camera has been proposed where the user can freely change the frame rate at the time of shooting.",
        "Images shot by such a variable-speed frame rate shooting camera are recorded, for example, such that a scene is recorded at 60 frames per second and another scene, at 12 frames per second.",
        "Moreover, a frame rate conversion system for a variable-speed frame rate shooting camera has been proposed.",
        "For example, when the above-mentioned image is converted into an image of 24 frames per second, a scene recorded at 60 frames per second is converted into an image in a slow motion of 1/2.5 and a scene of 12 frames per second is converted into an image at double speed.",
        "In such a frame rate conversion system, the way time codes are attached to the image after conversion is important.",
        "Specifically, since frame rate conversion changes the number of frames that are displayed in one second, time code conversion is essential.",
        "In the frame rate conversion such that the image length is different between before and after conversion, there is a possibility that not only the time codes of the lowest two digits (the frame number at the corresponding hour, minute, and second) but also the time codes of the other digits (hour, minute, and second) are changed.",
        "For example, when conversion to an image of 24 frames per second is performed by a conversion method where an image length is the same between before and after conversion, a frame assigned a time code 01:15:24:30 in an image of 60 frames per second is assigned a time code 01:15:24:12 (three of every five frames are removed in the thinning-out).",
        "Needless to say, when conversion is performed by a conversion method where an image length is different between before and after conversion, a time code such as 01:15:24:XX is not always assigned to the frame.",
        "It takes much time to manually assign time codes so that overlapping is avoided while establishing correspondence with time codes before conversion.",
        "Therefore, the inventor considers that it is desirable to automatically re-assign time codes at the time of frame rate conversion processing without manually assigning the time codes.",
        "However, a standard method of calculating time codes in such a case where image length is different between before and after frame rate conversion has not been established yet.",
        "It is considered that when an image shot at a variable-speed frame rate is frame-rate-converted and the output image is used for editing as an image material, it is desirable to convert only the necessary section. This is because it is unnecessary to search for obvious N.G. images at the time of editing and consequently, editing can be performed with efficiency.",
        "In view of the above-mentioned conventional problem, an object of the present invention is to provide a signal processing apparatus, a signal processing method, a program and a recording medium capable of automatically assigning time codes after conversion to a frame-rate-converted image.",

        "Next, the operation of the frame rate converting apparatus of the present embodiment will be described with reference mainly to FIG. 5 which is an explanatory view of the time code conversion of the first embodiment of the present invention. An embodiment of the signal processing method of the present invention will also be described while the operation of the frame rate converting apparatus of the present embodiment is described (this applied to other embodiments).",
        "A case where an image shot at 30 frames per second is converted into an image of 24 frames per second will be described in the following (in the following embodiment, neither frame insertion nor thinning-out is performed and the number of frames is not changed between before and after conversion).",
        "Specifically, a case where the following sections of the input image are converted will be described: a section {circle around (1)} from 00:04:00:00 to 00:08:00:00; and a section {circle around (2)} from 00:16:00:00 to 00:22:00:00.",
        "For simplicity, a case where nondrop frame time codes are calculated will be described.",
        "In FIG. 5, the time codes at the starting points of the sections {circle around (1)} and {circle around (2)} of the input image coincide with those at the starting points of the sections {circle around (1)} and {circle around (2)} of the output image.",
        "The playback time of an image of 24 frames per second is 1.25 times longer than that of an image of 30 frames per second.",
        "Consequently, the length of the section {circle around (1)} of the output image is 00:05:00:00 which is 1.25 times 00:04:00:00.",
        "Moreover, the length of the section {circle around (2)} of the output image is 00:07:30:00 which is 1.25 times 00:06:00:00.",
        "Therefore, the time codes in the section {circle around (1)} of the output image are 00:04:00:00 to 00:09:00:00.",
        "Moreover, the time codes in the section {circle around (2)} of the output image are 00:16:00:00 to 00.:23:30:00.",
        "In the above-described time code conversion, although the time codes in the output image are dependent on the conversion section, an advantage is obtained such that the time codes in the input image can be easily inferred from the time codes in the output image and this is sensuously easy for the user to understand.",
        "(A) When the time code at the starting point of the section {circle around (1)} of the input image is 00:03:59:29 which is one frame earlier, the time code 00:03:59:29 which is absent in an image of a frame rate of 24 frames per second cannot be adopted as a time code in the output image.",

        "From this, the time code at the starting point of the section {circle around (2)} of the input image is nothing but the time code where the number of frames from the starting point of the section, of the input image, where the frame rate is 12 frames per second, is 2880 (=24480\u221221600).",
        "The number of frames 2880 corresponds to 00:04:00:00 when converted with respect to 12 frames per second.",
        "From the above, the time code at the starting point of the section {circle around (2)} of the input image is calculated to be 00:16:00:00 by considering the frame rate change point data (12 frames per second, 00:12:00:00).",
        "Likewise, the time code at the end point of the section {circle around (2)} of the output image is calculated to be 00:21:59:29.",
        "In the present embodiment, the number of frames from the sync point is calculated by obtaining the cumulative sum of the number of frames. Consequently, even when the input image is a variable-speed frame rate image, the uniqueness of the output time codes is ensured, so that the input time codes can be uniquely identified from the output time codes.",
        "Moreover, in the present embodiment, since the input time codes can be uniquely identified from the output time codes, it is not difficult to extend the section of use of the output image. For example, it is unnecessary to count the number of frames while rewinding the input image, and it can be easily performed to go back by a desired number of frames to re-convert the frame rate.",
        "In the above, the first to eighth embodiments are described in detail.",
        "As described above, when an image is converted into a predetermined frame rate, time codes can be efficiently assigned at high speed without any manual intervention. Needless to say, such an effect is produced even when the numerical values such as frame rates are other than those in the above-described embodiments.",
        "The program of the present invention is a program of causing a computer to execute the operations of all or some of the steps (or processes, operations, workings or the like) of the above-described signal processing method of the present invention, said program operating in concert with the computer.",
