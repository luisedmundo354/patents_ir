Additionally, in the various embodiments, each component in the multicomponent oxide material is different. For example, where a multicomponent oxide includes three metal cations, i.e., a three-component oxide, the same two cations will not be included in the three-component oxide, thus, if zinc is included in the three-component oxide, it will not be included as a second or third component of the three-component oxide. In another example, if zinc is a component of a four-component oxide, the other three components of the four-component oxide will not include zinc.

For example, the thickness can have a range of about 1 nanometer to about 1,000 nanometers. In an alternative embodiment, the thickness can have a range of about 10 nanometers to about 200 nanometers.",
        "In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the multicomponent oxide can include compounds of at least one metal cation from group 12, and at least one metal cation from group 13, wherein the group 12 cation includes Zn and Cd cations, and the group 13 cation includes Ga and In cations to form at least one of a three-component oxide, a four-component oxide, and a two-component oxide that includes zinc-gallium oxide, cadmium-gallium oxide, cadmium-indium oxide. The precursor compounds for group 12 and group 13 metal cations are typically mononuclear (i.e., monomers in that they contain one metal per molecule), although weakly bound dimers (i.e., dimers containing two monomers weakly bonded together through hydrogen or dative bonds) are also possible. In additional embodiments of the present disclosure, the precursor compounds used for forming the multicomponent oxide can include organometallic compounds suitable for vapor deposition. Example of such organometallic compounds include, but are not limited to, zinc acethylacetonate [Zn(C5H7O2)2] and indium acethylacetonate [In(C5H7O2)3].",
        "As discussed herein, the precursor compounds used for forming the multicomponent oxide in a sputtering process in the embodiments of the present disclosure can include two, three, and four-component oxides. For example, a two-component oxide can be used as a target to form the channel. The two-component oxide can be deposited in a thin-film by sputtering by use of the above-mentioned target and a single-phase crystalline state for the channel can be obtained. For illustration, a single-phase crystalline state can include compounds from group 12, and compounds from group 13, wherein group 12 includes an oxide of the metal cation Zn, such as ZnO, and group 13 includes an oxide of the metal cation Ga, such as Ga2O3, of the formula:\n\nZn2Ga2yOx+3y \n\nIn this embodiment, the values of x and y can be found in given ranges. For example, x and y can each independently be found in a range of about 1 to about 15, a range of about 2 to about 10, integer values greater than 1, and integer values less than 15. Specific examples of the value of x and y include 2 and 1, respectively, where the single-phase crystalline state of the zinc-gallium oxide includes Zn2Ga2O5.",
        "Alternatively, embodiments of the zinc-gallium oxide can exhibit a mixed-phase crystalline state resulting from sputtering by use of the above-mentioned target. For example, the mixed-phase crystalline state can include, but is not limited to, two or more phases that can include, for example, ZnO, Zn2Ga2O5, and Ga2O3 with a range of phase-to-phase ratio A:B:C (e.g., ZnO:Zn2Ga2O5: Ga2O3), where A, B, and C, are each in the range of about 0.01 to about 0.99.",
        "Additionally, the compounds of the group 12 and group 13 cations can exhibit excellent electron transport in the amorphous state. As such, a desireable level of performance can be achieved without crystallization of the multicomponent oxide. Thus, in various embodiments, the zinc-gallium oxide can have a substantially amorphous form. For example, the zinc-gallium oxide can include an atomic composition of zinc(x):gallium (1-x), where x is in the range of about 0.01 to about 0.99. This atomic composition does not take into consideration the optional presence of oxygen and other elements. It is merely a representation of the relative ratio of zinc and gallium. In an additional embodiment, x can be in the range of about 0.1 to about 0.9, and in the range of about 0.05 to about 0.95.",
        "As one of ordinary skill will appreciate, in embodiments where three and four-component oxides are used for channel formation by sputtering and other deposition techniques, the atomic compositions for each precursor compound can include a range of about 0.01 to about 0.99. Additionally, other ranges can include a range of about 0.1 to about 0.9, and a range of about 0.05 to about 0.095.",
        "Additionally, since each of these multicomponent oxide materials is based on combination of groups 12 and 13 cations, a substantial degree of qualitative similarity is expected in structural and electrical properties, and in processing considerations. Furthermore, zinc-indium oxide, a constituent of the two-component oxides disclosed herein has been shown to exhibit excellent electron transport and thus, qualitatively similar performance from the remaining two-component oxide combinations including the three, and four-component oxides can be expected. An example of the electron transport characteristics of the zinc-indium oxide can be found in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/799,961 entitled \u201cSEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE\u201d filed on Mar. 12, 2004.",
        "Sputtering or chemical vapor deposition processes can be carried out in an atmosphere of inert gas and/or a reaction gas to form a relatively pure multicomponent oxide channel. The inert gas is typically selected from the group including nitrogen, helium, argon, and mixtures thereof. In the context of the present disclosure, the inert gas is one that is generally unreactive with the precursor compounds described herein and does not interfere with the formation of a multicomponent oxide channel.",
        "The reaction gas can be selected from a wide variety of gases reactive with the precursor compounds described herein, at least at a surface under the conditions of deposition. Examples of reaction gases include hydrogen and oxidizing gases such as O2. Various combinations of carrier gases and/or reaction gases can be used in the embodiments of the present disclosure to form the multicomponent oxide channel.",
        "For example, in a sputtering process for the multicomponent oxide channel, the process may be performed by using a mixture of argon and oxygen as the sputtering gas at a particular flow rate, with the application of an RF power for achieving the desired deposition in a sputter deposition chamber. However, it should be readily apparent that any manner of forming the multicomponent oxide channel is contemplated in accordance with the present disclosure and is in no manner limited to any particular process, e.g., sputtering, for formation thereof.",
        "In block 330, both a gate electrode and a gate dielectric positioned between the gate electrode and the channel can be provided in forming an embodiment of the thin-film transistor of the present disclosure.",
        "The embodiments described herein may be used for fabricating chips, integrated circuits, monolithic devices, semiconductor devices, and microelectronic devices, such as display devices. For example, FIG. 4 illustrates an embodiment of a display device such as an active-matrix liquid-crystal display (AMLCD) 480. In FIG. 4, the AMLCD 480 can include pixel devices (i.e., liquid crystal elements) 440 in a matrix of a display area 460. The pixel devices 440 in the matrix can be coupled to thin-film transistors 400 also located in the display area 460. The thin-film transistor 400 can include embodiments of the thin-film transistors as disclosed herein. Additionally, the AMLCD 480 can include orthogonal control lines 462 and 464 for supplying an addressable signal voltage to the thin-film transistors 400 to influence the thin-film transistors to turn on and off and control the pixel devices 440, e.g., to provide an image on the AMLCD 480.",
