        "The invention relates to predicting or determining ink concentration and/or ink thickness on an on-line printing process.",
        "Online inspection of printed materials is realized in the prior art through the use of either a densitometer attached to the printing press that reads small area of ink along the edge of the substrate, known as test targets or through the use of an electronic color video or color digital camera that reads either the test targets or specified areas within the printed image. Disclosures of such prior art are found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,289,405; 5,163,012; and 5,774,225.",
        "In those methods that utilize a color video camera, the camera is used as a light sensor with three wide-band light detectors, commonly referred to as Red, Green or Blue (RGB) with spectral sensitivities that peak in the \u201cblue\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cred\u201d regions of the visible spectrum as shown in FIG. 1. The light sensor integrates or sums all of the light rays with wavelengths within its passband. The camera sensors are then used to approximate the responses of a Standard ISO Status Density, as defined in ISO 5/3 and illustrated in FIG. 2. It is important to note that the spectral response of the three camera sensors only approximate the ISO Status Density spectral curves.",
        "The densitometer or the camera measures \u201csubstrate relative\u201d density. That is, the camera is first pointed to the unprinted substrate and the light projected onto the substrate. The projected light that is reflected from the substrate is collected by camera in each of its three sensors. Typical RGB camera signals are binary coded values with a range of 0 to 255 (8 bits). The camera is adjusted so that a perfect white object will read RGB values (255, 255, 255). The values are normalized so that the perfect white will have relative values of (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) as is disclosed in patents U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,724,259 and 5,767,980. The normalized values of the sensors are converted into density by computing the negative of the logarithm of the sensor value. Next, a printed area is move into the field of view of the camera and the light projected onto that area. The camera captures the light reflected from the printed area, comprised of the ink and the substrate. The camera readings are again converted to density. The previously computed substrate density is then subtracted from the ink-on-substrate density to leave only the density of the ink. The density of the ink is assumed to be proportional to the thickness of the ink layer.",
        "Because of the differences between the camera sensors and an ISO Status Densitometer, it is not possible to simultaneously obtain colorant concentration and ink film thickness. On a commercial offset press the only parameter that is available to the pressman to control is the weight of ink applied to the substrate which modulates the ink film thickness. Accordingly, there is a need in the printing industry to have a press inspection system that measures and tacks the color and the concentration of the inks as they are being printed.",

        "Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description and appended claims.",
        "FIG. 1 shows plots of spectral extinction for a series of batches of ink with varying amounts of pigment in the ink.",
        "A method has been discovered to measuring the reflectance of an ink film as printed on a printing press, and during the operation of that press with the intent of monitoring the ink concentration and the ink film thickness.",
        "Accordingly, the camera sensor in the present invention is used as an absolute reflectometer. The camera is not standardized to the substrate but to an absolute white standard, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,821,993 and 6,151,064. The measurements of the substrate, the ink on the substrate are all made on the same basis as readings made off-line on a spectrophotometer or spectrocolorimeter. Knowing the spectral response of the camera will allow the offline instrument to approximate the camera measurements on the off-line spectral instrument and provide absolute data to the camera about the color, film thickness and concentration dependence of the ink.",
        "When the press is operating, the camera may be used to capture the color of the press sheets during startup and compare them to the standard values computed off-line. This greatly reduces the print \u201cmake-ready\u201d time for the printer. Getting acceptable prints sooner results in lower waste amounts and in better utilization of the printing machinery.",
        "Additionally the camera may be used to monitor the color of the printing through out the run by comparing the current printed image to the laboratory colors or to the colors in the first acceptable image. If the color begins to drift, the data supplied by the camera may be used to adjust either the ink film thickness (also known as the film weight) or the concentration of base color in the ink well using the process described below.",
        "In offset lithography, the inks are very thick pastes, loaded with as much pigment as modern chemical engineering can allow. The paste is mixed with water, either from a press fountain or at the ink factory in the form of pre-emulsified ink. The only operational controls on the press, known as \u201ckeys\u201d control the amount of ink transferred from the roller train to the plate and from the plate to the blanket and from the blanket to the substrate. Since the ink does not evaporate, the weight of film on the substrate can be determined indirectly by weighing the rollers before and after printing. The difference in weight represents the amount of ink transferred. The film weight or thickness is historically controlled, offline by status densitometry.",
        "In direct gravure printing or flexographic printing, the inks are thin liquids and the amount of ink transferred is controlled by the size and shape of the impressions in the gravure cylinder or anilox cylinder. The film thickness is quite difficult or nearly impossible to assess, even offline. Because the inks are thin liquids, held in simple wells, it is possible to adjust the amount of base ink relative to the printing solvent and thus adjust the concentration of the pigment in the ink transferred to the substrate.",
        "One lesser known method for computing the optical properties of a thin, transparent, pigmented coating in the laboratory uses the model of turbid media developed by Hoffman in the 1960s and simplified by Schmelzer in the 1970s (Hoffman, K., \u201cZusammenhang zwischen Extinktion bzw. Transmission und Remission micht streuender Farbauflagen aug weissem Untergrund\u201d, Farbe and Lack, 76, (7), 665-672, (1970); Schmelzer, H., \u201cN\u00e4herungsl\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr die Theorie tranparenter Schichten auf streuendem Untergrund\u201d, Farbe and Lack, 87, (1), 15-18, (1981)). In this model the coating is assumed to be transparent and absorbing of light and the substrate is assumed to be opaque and scattering of light. In the simplified formalism, the extinction (E) of light by the ink film can be derived from the reflectance (\u03c1) of the transparent coatings over the opaque substrate as shown in equation 1. Here, the parameters B, b, and B0 are constants for which Schmelzer has made suggested values of 1.000 for B, 4.271 for b and 0.606 for B0.",

        "This derivation assumed that the light was taken in small increments of energy or wavelength bands, such as found in monochromatic light. In fact, it has been reported that narrow bands of wavelength are not needed for color control (Strocka, D., \u201cAre intervals of 20 nm sufficient for industrial color measurement?\u201d, COL-OUR 73, Adam Hilger, London, 453-456, (1973); and Billmeyer, F. W., Beasley, J. K., Sheldon, J. A., \u201cFormulation of transparent colors with a digital computer\u201d, Journal of the Optical Society of America, 50, 70-72, (1960)). In the application of this model to color formulation in the laboratory, it has been assumed that the ratio of absorption to scattering (K/S) is modulated by both the concentration (c) of the absorbing species and the thickness (t) of the coating such that the total E is proportional to \u03b5, the relative (relative to the scattering of the substrate) unit extinction coefficient, a predetermined measurement of the pre-printed ink per unit concentration per unit thickness, as shown in equation 2.\n\nE=\u03b5\u00d7c\u00d7t\u2003\u2003(2)",
        "Using this formalism it is possible to substitute a camera response (R, G, or B) or a CIE calorimetric response (X, Y, or Z), obtained by linear transformation from RGB for the value of \u03c1 in equation 1 thus yielding an equation that can be used to control either the film thickness (t) or the concentration (c) using readings captured by the camera on-line over a printing press. Good results were reported by applying general approximations to the coefficients shown in equation (1)(Schmelzer, H., \u201cN\u00e4herungsl\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr die Theorie tranparenter Schichten auf streuendem Untergrund\u201d, Farbe and Lack, 87, (1), 15-18, (1981)).

The relative film weight is computed as the ratio of the Extinction (E) values for the various labs to those of the first lab.
