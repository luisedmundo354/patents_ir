    "abstract": "A method for depositing a low dielectric constant film is provided by positioning a substrate within a processing chamber having a powered electrode, and flowing into the processing chamber an initiation gas mixture of a flow rate of one or more organosilicon compounds and a flow rate of one or more oxidizing gases to deposit an initiation layer by applying an RF power to the electrode. The organosilicon compound flow rate is then ramped-up to a final flow rate to deposit a first transition layer, upon which one or more porogen compounds is introduced and the flow rate porogen compound is ramped up to a final deposition rate while depositing a second transition layer. A porogen doped silicon oxide layer is then deposited by flowing the final porogen and organosilicon flow rates until the RF power is turned off.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to the fabrication of integrated circuits. More particularly, the embodiments relates to methods for depositing dielectric layers on a substrate and structures that include the dielectric layer.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Semiconductor device geometries have dramatically decreased in size since such devices were first introduced several decades ago. Since then, integrated circuits have generally followed the two year/half-size rule (often called Moore's Law), which means that the number of devices that will fit on a chip doubles every two years. Today's fabrication plants are routinely producing devices having 0.13 \u03bcm and even 0.1 \u03bcm feature sizes, and tomorrow's plants soon will be producing devices having even smaller geometries.",
        "In order to further reduce the size of devices on integrated circuits, it has become necessary to use conductive materials having low resistivity and to use insulators having low dielectric constants (k) to reduce the capacitive coupling between adjacent metal lines. One such low k material is spin-on glass, such as un-doped silicon glass (USG) or fluorine-doped silicon glass (FSG), which can be deposited as a gap fill layer in a semiconductor manufacturing process. Other examples of low k materials include carbon doped silicon oxides and polytetrafluoroethylene. However, the continued reduction in device geometries has generated a demand for films having even lower k values.",
        "Recent developments in low dielectric constants have focused on incorporating silicon, carbon, and oxygen atoms into the deposited film. One of the approaches to obtain an ultra low dielectric constant is to fabricate hybrid films of an organic porogen and a silicon matrix. During the post-treatment, the porogens are removed, resulting in porous low k materials. These porous films are known to have less adhesion to underlying barrier layers than silicon oxides. Improvement of adhesion may be obtained by depositing an initiation layer of oxide, which can enhance adhesion at the interface. To further improve adhesion, it has been suggested to use a gradient layer with increasing carbon content gradually between initiation and main deposition step. However, this method can cause undesirable gas phase reaction causing unwanted particles to form in the films, resulting in defect issues. Therefore, there is a need for a process for making low dielectric constant materials with improved adhesion and without particle defect issues.",
        "Embodiments of the present invention generally provide a method for depositing a low dielectric constant film.

The PRODUCER\u00ae CVD chamber (200 mm or 300 mm) has two isolated processing regions that may be used to deposit carbon-doped silicon oxides and other materials. A chamber having two isolated processing regions is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,855,681, which is incorporated by reference herein.",

Each processing region 318, 320 has a pedestal 328 for supporting a substrate (not seen) within the chamber 300. The pedestal 328 typically includes a heating element (not shown). Preferably, the pedestal 328 is movably disposed in each processing region 318, 320 by a stem 326 which extends through the bottom of the chamber body 302 where it is connected to a drive system 303. Internally movable lift pins (not shown) are preferably provided in the pedestal 328 to engage a lower surface of the substrate.

The showerhead 342 includes a plurality of nozzles (not shown) through which gaseous mixtures are injected during processing. An RF (radio frequency) supply 325 provides a bias potential to the showerhead 342 to facilitate generation of a plasma between the showerhead and the pedestal 328. During a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition process, the pedestal 328 may serve as a cathode for generating the RF bias within the chamber body 302. The cathode is electrically coupled to an electrode power supply to generate a capacitive electric field in the deposition chamber 300. Typically an RF voltage is applied to the cathode while the chamber body 302 is electrically grounded. Power applied to the pedestal 328 creates a substrate bias in the form of a negative voltage on the upper surface of the substrate. This negative voltage is used to attract ions from the plasma formed in the chamber 300 to the upper surface of the substrate. The capacitive electric field forms a bias which accelerates inductively formed plasma species toward the substrate to provide a more vertically oriented anisotropic filming of the substrate during deposition, and etching of the substrate during cleaning.",

During deposition the chamber pressure was maintained at a pressure of about 4.5 Torr and the substrate was maintained at a temperature of about 350\u00b0 C. The substrate was positioned 300 mils from the gas distribution showerhead.",
        "The substrate was positioned on a substrate support disposed within a process chamber. The process gas mixture having an initial gas composition of 1000 sccm helium and 700 sccm oxygen for the interface layer was introduced into the chamber and flow rates stabilized before initiation of the RF power. Subsequently, RF power of about 500 W was applied to the showerhead to form a plasma of the interface process gas mixture composition including a OMCTS flow rate of about 300 mg/min. to deposit a silicon oxide initiation layer. After initiation of the RF power for about 2 seconds, the flow rate of OMCTS was increased at a ramp-up rate of about 1500 mg/min./sec. for about 2 seconds. In addition, the flow of O2 was decreased at a ramp-down rate of about 500 sccm/sec.",
        "Upon reaching and keeping a final OMCTS flow rate of about 2000 mg/min, a flow of cyclohexadiene was introduced into the chamber at a ramp-up rate of about 375 mg/min./sec. over about 4 seconds to reach a porogen deposition flow rate of about 1500 mg/min./sec. The final gas mixture composition also includes 900 sccm helium and 160 sccm oxygen. Upon reaching the desired thickness of the porogen-containing organosilicate dielectric layer after about 58 seconds, the RF power (RF and LFRF) is terminated to stop further deposition. After RF power termination, the chamber throttle valve is opened to allow the process gas mixture to be pumped out of the chamber. Analysis of the organosilicate dielectric layer indicates about 7 particle adders above 0.16 \u03bcm.",
        "A comparison organosilicate dielectric layer was synthesized using the same process parameters as described, but with the OMCTS and the cyclohexadiene having simultaneous, as opposed to separate, ramp-ups of 750 mg/min./sec. and 375 mg/min./sec., respectively. Analysis of the comparison organosilicate dielectric layer indicates about 74000 particle adders above 0.16 \u03bcm.",
        "Many variations of the above example may be practiced. For example, other organosilane precursors, porogen precursors, oxidizing gases, and inert gases may be used. In addition, different flow rates and/or ramp rates may be employed. In one example TMCTS may be used as the organosilane precursor instead of OMCTS. In another example, the organosilane precursor may include a flow of trimethylsilane combined with a flow of OMCTS. In another example bicycloheptadiene may be used as the porogen precursor instead of cyclohexadiene.",
        "Examples of varying porogen transition flow rates and porogen ramp-up rates and their effect on the total number of particle adders are presented in the table below. Increase in porogen transition flow rate and porogen ramp-up rates result in organosilicate dielectric layers with higher levels of particle adders above 0.16 \u03bcm.",
