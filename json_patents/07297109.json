        "Diet and lifestyle are key factors in chronic medical conditions such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and many other conditions. As a result, there are hundreds of diets\u2014fad diets, celebrity promoted diets, and medically based diets. Yet as a whole, Americans still eat a high fat, high calorie, junk food diet. Also, diet programs are notorious for the poor adherence by the dieters.",
        "A problem with existing diets, weight loss programs, and healthy regimens is that the diets are very difficult to faithfully follow, or adhere to. The task of keeping track of what is healthy or required by the diet is so tedious that, as a result, many diet program participants return to fatty foods simply for convenience and lack of sufficient interest to overcome the tedium. Another problem is that the present systems do not provide enough measurement and feedback to let one know how they are progressing. Even with diet programs that require the dieter to visit a center to weigh in, the dieters are nevertheless on their own most of the time. Finally, food labeled as healthy food is usually more expensive than fatticr foods.",
        "The following patents are examples of the prior art discussed above.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 5,890,128 to Diaz et al. discloses hand held individually customized interactive integrated circuit device for nutrition and exercise management. The device of Diaz et al. includes built in storage of extensive food lists with associated caloric and fat contents. Diaz et al. incorporates storage of exercises with associated activity caloric values or rates. Diaz et al. utilizes the individual's personal characteristics such as sex, age, weight, height, frame size, life style and goals with programmed calculations to derive optimum suggested weight, metabolic rate, daily caloric/fat intake targets, exercise targets and exercise/daily calorie burning rates. Diaz et al. tracks daily and historical individual caloric input/output, fat input, and weight which can be viewed in the form of charts and graphs. Optional medical programs take into consideration special dieting, medication and exercise requirements of patients with diabetes, high cholesterol, heart ailments, hypoglycemia and other diseases. Diaz et al. is good at tracking historical data but fails to provide a system that will automatically generate a food order for home delivery based on the derived information.",

Visual and audio prompts tell users when to eat and exercise, and provide suggestions for what to eat. Abrams et al. teaches assisting the user in setting safe goals for desired weight loss and the time required to achieve the loss. The user follows menu and exercise programs suggested by the system. The system records and analyzes the user's food consumption, exercise and weight loss programs. Finally, the computer displays feedback information regarding the user's progress towards achieving the desired weight. If the users have planned which meals they will select from a set of future recommendations, then the planned meals can be presented in such a way as to make selection and recording of the meals simple and quick. Also, meal planning allows the Behavior Planning routine to build a shopping list for the users to ensure they will have the necessary food on hand to prepare planned meals.",

The user devices 20 can be of varying types as will be described in more detail below.",
        "The user device 20 is a computer device that includes a processor 32 and a display 34, an input device 35 and memory 36 coupled to the processor 32. The processor 32 couples to the public or private communication network 26 via network accessibility software pre-stored in the memory 36.",
        "The user devices 20 use the display 34 to inform the users that input information is desired. The user is a patient, a caregiver for the patient, or some other person requiring program information, such as diet program information. Preferably, the display 34 includes an alphanumeric display capable of displaying questions corresponding to the user or patient. The user device 20 receives from the user using the input device 35 answers to the displayed questions. For example, if the displayed question asks what is the user's/patient's weight that day, the user enters the patient's weight into the user device 20 using the input device 35.",
        "The input device 35 includes a keypad or keyboard, such as a television remote control, or is a keypad with a restricted set of keys by which the user increments, decrements, or accepts a value to be entered for the patient, such as the patient's weight for that day. In an alternate embodiment, the input device 35 is a monitoring device that generates a monitored signal and automatically sends the monitored signal to the processor 32. The type of monitoring device used by each user is dependent upon the user's diet. For example, for a weight loss patient, the monitoring device is a weight scale. For a diabetes patient, the monitoring device is a blood glucose meter for measuring the patient's blood glucose concentrations. For an asthma patient, the monitoring device is a peak flow meter for measuring the patient's peak flow rates. Such monitoring devices for recording and transmitting measurements are well known in the art.",

        "The program server 22 also generates a program adherence value. The program adherence value is a value that indicates how well the patient is adhering to the program. The program adherence value is calculated according the patient's determined diet or meal plan, predefined goals, the patient's food intake and other input information.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates the process performed by the components illustrated in FIG. 1. First, at block 100, the program server 22 sends a query to the patients. Then, at block 104, the patients or users replies to the query by answering the query and sending the answers to the program server 22. At block 108, the program server 22 determines a meal or diet plan for each patient according to the patient's reply to the query and previous food order information. Next, at block 112, the program server 22 generates a food list according to the determined meal or diet plan and sends the food list to the delivery system 24. Finally, at block 116, the delivery system 24 prepares a food order according to the food list, delivers the food order to the patient and sends information regarding the food order to the program server 22. After block 116, the process returns to block 100.",
        "The program server 22 generates or prepares food lists based on specific goal achievement, such as reducing fat intake to 20%, lowering cholesterol to 100, losing 10 pounds, etc. As such, the program server 22 must calculate food intake and then determine a list of foods that fits into the meal plan based on the calculated food intake.",
        "The queries sent by the program server 22 provides questions that allow the program server 22 to determine each patient's goals and preferences, monitor each patient's weight, diet choices, satisfaction with the food items in the food order and food choices available on the meal plan, allow patients to make food substitutions and present to the patient special offers and financial incentives to make food choices, as determined by the program server 22 from information received from the delivery system 24, prestored pricing information or some other pricing source. The queries also include, depending upon when the query occurs, a hierarchy of user interface windows, such as those in the HTTP format. These windows include links to patient information, program adherence, food choices, etc. The links when activated by the patient send the patient to other pages or window generated by the program server.",
        "In another embodiment, the program server 22 also tracks various types of data for market research that will enable researchers to learn more about the interaction between disease and diet.",
        "In still another embodiment, the program server 22 keeps track of the progress of a group of participants and feeds back combined progress information to an individual participant. This makes small individual changes seem more important and helps motivate the patient. For example: a diet patient receives the following message from the program server 22: \u201cthe weight club of Northern California lost 900 pounds today! Keep up the good work!\u201d The user device 20 can alternately be a remotely programmable appliance, such as a Health Buddy made by Health Hero Network, that is updated, monitored, and reprogrammed according to protocols assigned to the patient at the program server 22. The remotely programmable appliance is remotely manipulatable by the operator administering the diet through the program server 22.",
        "The following is an example of a diet program interaction using the process illustrated in FIG. 2. The first query from the program server includes the following questions:\n\n    \n    \n        How much do you weigh?\n        How tall are you?\n        How old are you?\n        How much do you exercise?\n        What is your weight goal? After the program server receives the participant's reply to the query, the program server assesses the participant's profile information determines a diet plan according to the participant's profile information. The program server sends the participant the following response that includes another query:\n        Your ideal weight is 170.\n        You can lose 10 pounds in less than 3 months if you stick to a 1500 calorie 20% fat diet.\n        Would you like help assembling a grocery list for this diet?\n        Here are the selections for breakfast ...\n        Here are the selections for lunch ...\n        Here are the selections for dinner ...\n        Press OK to confirm or CANCEL to delete a selection.\n        Would you like to review your 1500 calorie meal plan?\n        Shall we shop for groceries now?\n        We have assembled the following food basket for you:\n        \n            Steak\n            Peas\n            Lettuce\n        \n        \n        Press OK to order, REVIEW to edit selections\n        When would you like this order delivered?\n        Available delivery times this week are:\n        \n            Wednesday AM\n            Thursday PM\n        \n        \n        What is your weight today?\n        Have you been sticking to your meal plan?\n        Would you like some new diet ideas?\n        We have a great prepared chef special of lean turkey casserole with a side order of beans. Shall we add the recipe and food items to your next delivery?\n        How do you like the Total Raisin Bran cereal?\n        \n            GOOD BAD TRY ANOTHER\n        \n        \n        9 out of 10 people on your diet have really enjoyed Healthy Start cereal.\n        Would you like to add it to your shopping list?\n        \n            YES NO\n        \n        \n        The program server sends the following after a reply by the patient that they want the Thursday PM delivery time.\n        Your next delivery is scheduled for 7:00 PM Thursday.\n        \n            REVIEW ORDER",
        "The patient, or dieter in the example above, can also select food items from a food list presented on a web site, or the user can express some preferences based on food choices presented on the web site. The user's selections or expressed preferences are then used by the program application to generate a diet regimen. The user's food selections or preferences could also be mailed in, and entered at the program server 22 and used accordingly.",
