        "The operation in the conventional example shown in FIG. 1 will now be briefly described. When started, the control unit 1 performs initialization of the device 50 as it is necessary, and reads out and executes the program stored in the storage unit 3.",
        "The control unit 1 controls the input/output unit 2 according to the program that is being executed. When executing the program, the control unit 1 also prepares a temporary file or the like and properly stores it into the storage unit 4, if necessary, and thus operates the device 50.",
        "However, in the device 50 as shown in FIG. 1, the program is incorporated in the device. Therefore, in the case of correcting trouble of the program or adding a function, the program stored in the storage unit 3 must be modified or another program must be added.",

If it is judged that a request for processing of the additional function is not received, the control unit 7 waits.",
        "If it is judged at \u201cS501\u201d in FIG. 9 that a request for processing of the additional function is received, the control unit 7 at \u201cS502\u201d in FIG. 9 reads out the program to realize the additional function, stored in the storage unit 8, and inputs the information such as a parameter received from the device 51, if necessary, to execute the program.",
        "At \u201cS503\u201d in FIG. 9, the control unit 7 controls the web server unit 9 to send the result of processing, which is the result of execution of the program to realize the additional function, to the device 51 via the network 102.",
        "Thus, in the case of using an additional function, by accessing the web server unit 9 of the arithmetic processing device 53 in which the program to execute the additional function is installed, via the network 102, then making a request for processing of the additional function and receiving the result of processing, the device 51, which is an incorporated device, can add the function irrespective of the resources of the device (device 51).",
        "In this case, since the control unit 1 causes the display unit to display the web page sent from the web server unit 9 by using the web browser, the control unit 1 need not perform reconstruction of the user interface or the like such as additional display of a button to execute the additional function on the display screen or change of the hierarchical structure of menu corresponding to the additional function.",
        "While the two storage units 3 and 4 are described in order to simplify the explanation in the embodiments shown in FIGS. 3 and 6, a single storage unit may be used to realize the functions of the storage unit 3 and the storage unit 4.",
        "In the description of the embodiment shown in FIG. 3, if it is judged that the additional function is available, the control unit 1 performs reconstruction of the user interface such as additional display of a button to execute the additional function or change of the hierarchical structure of menu corresponding to the additional function. However, the user interface itself may be downloaded via the network or may be read from a storage medium such as flexible disk or CD-ROM.",
        "In the description of the embodiment shown in FIG. 3, if it is judged that the additional function is available, the control unit 1 performs reconstruction of the user interface such as additional display of a button to execute the additional function or change of the hierarchical structure of menu corresponding to the additional function. However, the user interface may be preset instead of dynamically reconstructing the user interface as described above.",
        "Specifically, a button to execute the additional function can be displayed in advance, or the hierarchical structure of menu corresponding to the additional function can be displayed in advance.",
        "In such cases, since the user interface is not reconstructed frequently, the load on the control unit 1 of the device 51, which is an incorporated device, is reduced.",
        "In the description of the embodiment shown in FIG. 3, if it is judged that the additional function is available, the control unit 1 performs reconstruction of the user interface such as additional display of a button to execute the additional function or change of the hierarchical structure of menu corresponding to the additional function. However, the user interface may be reconstructed when a designated operation is performed, instead of dynamically reconstructing the user interface as described above.",
        "Specifically, the user interface is reconstructed only when the power is turned on while a specific button is being pressed or when plural specific buttons are simultaneously pressed, or the like.",
        "In such cases, since the user interface is not reconstructed frequently, the load on the control unit 1 of the device 51, which is an incorporated device, is reduced.",
        "Moreover, when certain trouble disables use of the additional function of the arithmetic processing device 52 or 53 during processing, use of the corresponding user interface may be disabled.",
        "Specifically, an additionally displayed button or menu is deleted, or operation (press, selection or the like) of the button or menu is disabled while the button or menu is still displayed.",
        "In such cases, a request for processing of the additional function that is disabled during processing can be prevented. In the latter case, since the user interface is not reconstructed frequently, the load on the control unit 1 of the device 51, which is an incorporated device, is reduced.",
        "It is described in the embodiment shown in FIG. 3 and the other drawings that the arithmetic processing device 52 (or 53) is simply connected to the network 102. A specific example of the arithmetic processing device may be a server prepared by a manufacturer or a personal computer installed at home.",
        "In the former case, the device 51 (for example, home electronic device), which is an incorporated device, accesses the server prepared by the manufacturer via the Internet and causes the additional function to be processed on the server. In this case, the manufacturer can charge the user in accordance with the time for which the user uses the server.",
        "In the latter case, the device 51 (for example, home electronic device), which is an incorporated device, causes the additional function to be processed by using the remaining resources of the personal computer that is connected to a LAN at home and in which a program to execute the additional function has been installed in advance.",
        "Specific examples of the device 51, which is an incorporated device, include a hard disk recorder, measuring device, copy machine, air-conditioning equipment such as air conditioner, and so on. They can be applied to expansion of a timer function or expansion of a setting function of general home electronic devices.",
        "For example, in the case of a hard disk recorder, an image is encoded according to the MPEG (Moving Picture Coding Experts Group/Moving Picture Experts Group) system or the like and recorded onto a hard disk. When eliminating noise from the recorded image or adding an effect to the recorded image or performing other works such as editing, the arithmetic processing unit is caused to perform the work. Thus, various editing works can be arbitrarily added irrespective of the processing capability and resources of the hard disk recorder.",
        "For example, in the case of a measuring device, measurement data acquired by the measuring device is sent to the arithmetic processing device and the arithmetic processing device is caused to perform necessary processing. Thus, processing of various contents can be arbitrarily added irrespective of the processing capability and resources of the measuring device.",
        "For example, in the case of a copy machine, special processing of a copied image, an advanced OCR (optical character recognition/optical character reader) function or the like can be easily added by using an input/output unit such as touch panel.",
        "For example, in the case of air-conditioning equipment such as air conditioner, a preset temperature and an operating time of a day are set in the arithmetic processing device, and the air-conditioning equipment is controlled by a trigger such as turning on/off of operation from the arithmetic processing device or changing the preset temperature. Thus, finer control can be performed.",
        "Such expansion of the timer function can be applied to general home electronic devices such as washing machine, television, electric rice cooker and refrigerator. As information set in each of the home electronic devices (for example, user settings such as setting of a washing process of the washing machine or a cooking process of the rice cooker, and setting of channel of the television) is externally stored into the arithmetic processing device, it is easy to take over the information (user settings) when purchasing new home electronic devices to replace the existing ones.",
        "This invention has the following advantages. According to the inventions of claims 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, in the case of using an additional function, by accessing an arithmetic processing device in which a program to execute an additional function is installed, via a network, then making a request for processing of the additional function, and receiving the result of processing, a device which is an incorporated device can add the function irrespective of the resources of the device.",
        "According to the inventions of claims 3 and 4, in the case of using an additional function, by accessing a web server unit of the arithmetic processing device in which a program to execute the additional function is installed, via the network, then making a request for processing of the additional function and receiving the result of processing, the device, which is an incorporated device, can add the function irrespective of the resources of the device. Moreover, since a control unit causes a web page sent from the web server unit to be displayed on a display screen by using a web browser, the control unit need not perform reconstruction of a user interface or the like such as additional display of a button to execute the additional function on the display screen or change of the hierarchical structure of menu corresponding to the additional function.",
        "According to the inventions of claims 8, 9 and 10, reconstruction of the user interface is performed when a designated operation is performed by an input/output unit, such as downloading the user interface itself via the network or reading the user interface from a storage medium or causing the input/output unit to display a preset user interface. Thus, the user interface is not reconstructed frequently and the load on the control unit of the device, which is an incorporated device, is reduced.",
        "According to the invention of claim 11, when certain trouble disables use of an additional function of the arithmetic processing unit during processing, the corresponding user interface is deleted or operation (press, selection or the like) of the user interface is disabled. Thus, a request for processing of the additional function that is disabled during processing can be prevented. Moreover, in the latter case, since the user interface is not reconstructed frequently, the load on the control unit of the device, which is an incorporated device, is reduced."
