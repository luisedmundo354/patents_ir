    "title": "Blockage mitigation techniques for information transmission",
    "abstract": "Transmission channel monitoring, detection, classification, and adaptation provide solutions to severe information blockage problems during transmission. Channel monitoring is achieved through two types of detection and re-transmission strategies. Channel detection is accomplished by means of counting the number of negative acknowledgements, which classifies the channel degradation level and determines which alternatives to be adapted in order to combat specific blockage phenomenon. Blockage level is first translated into and related to transmission link parameters in terms of total carrier power to noise ratios, from which the methods of bit rate reduction, modem density increasing, and higher encoding rate are brought forth. A blockage identifier and the optimal smearing technique are used. Frequency-diversity and space-diversity, a method for combating complete blockage and an adaptive programmable channel equalization technique independent of channel characteristics are described. A cascading technique is taught to improve significantly false- and miss-detection probabilities. Performance measures are established in terms of system efficiency and error probability for blockage mitigation with unequal terminal capabilities.",

        "The field of this invention is in the area of providing solutions on information blockage problems due to transmission channel degradation.",
        "The significance of the blockage mitigation problems in information transmission has been addressed and identified by many for example: The U.S. Department of Defense components advocate mobile satellite communications. In 2004 the Air Force issued a request for proposal for 40 Gbps laser satellite communications with severe transmission degradation. The Army established the Future Combat System/Objective Force (FCS/OF) including satellites in 2003. The Navy requested innovative technologies in 2002 to support reliable and time critical multimedia information transmission for ships on the sea and submarines under the sea, where transmission channel characteristics are different. All components-addressed in satellite controlled UAVs (unmanned air vehicles), where operational hostile environment is unpredictable.",
        "Particular difficulty includes a satellite communication-on-the-move that encompasses acknowledgement-based protocols to recognize severe disruption in service and to employ appropriate correction techniques. Protocol analysis needs to ensure signal quality is maintained in the presence of errors during transmission, as well as maintaining quality of service (QoS) if the signal is blocked. An optimal solution is always sought to maintain QoS within the network. Demands for optimal solutions have not been met due to the difficulty of the problem. Existing techniques are neither adequate nor optimal.",
        "All transmission-blocking phenomena are time dependent and probabilistic. Previous studies have documented actual measurement by NASA/JPL of the Advanced Communications Technology Satellites (ACTS) Ka-band under heavy shadowed environments and have concluded that the 1% fade factor for Ka-band is well in excess of 30 dB, and may be as high as 45 dB. When a channel is multipath, space-time coding with multiple antennas can be useful. Among the well-known solutions is BLAST (Bell Laboratories Layered Space Time), which has multiple antennas. The idea of BLAST is to demodulate the desired signal and remove the rest, but, error propagation exists and ordering in detection is necessary.",
        "Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) has been advocated, but for a simple 6 bits per vector with 4 transmit antennas, the state complexity is 218. For Turbo decoding, impressive performances can only be obtained for code length of 10,000 bits with multiple (typical 8 to 10) iterations, and with a posteriori probabilistic or maximum likelihood decoding, which complicates both timing and equipment. Most significantly, what happens if the high-frequency transmission channel is not multipath, Gaussian, Rayleigh, or Ricean fading, and has no meteor insight? What happens if the transmission is completely blocked due to mountain tunneling or concrete jungles?",
        "The above examples illustrate the fact that needs existed and solutions sought. Prior arts limited to Ad Hoc fix leaking bucket approaches. Non-optimal solutions applied only to separate systems of wired or wireless, applicable only to specific degraded transmission channel conditions, or particular frequency range. This invention breaks through such limitations of related art with fundamental results independent of transmission media and operating frequencies with enhanced capabilities in blockage mitigation systems.",
        "For ARQ system evaluation, Peterson and Weldon (Error Correcting Codes, MIT Press, 1972) addressed the issue of the probability of an undetected error for block codes used in error detection. By the weights of code words in Hamming codes, the undetected error probability in a binary symmetric channel can be established through the corresponding weight-enumerating polynomial. In practice, it is very difficult to obtain the weight enumerators even with the help of MacWilliam's and Pless's power moment identities (The Theory of Error-Correcting Codes, North-Holland, 1977). This invention constructs system efficiency and error probability formulations for all ARQ/FEC based systems evaluations without weight enumeration for unequal terminal capabilities in the transmission network.",
        "This invention relates to transmission link parameter tradeoffs, multiple applications of error coding techniques, multiple uses of modulation/de-modulation, adaptive channel equalization, and diversity improvement methods. Transmission channel monitoring, detection, classification, and adaptation provide solutions to severe information blockage problems during transmission. Channel monitoring is achieved through two types of detection and re-transmission strategies. Channel detection is accomplished by means of counting the number of negative acknowledgements, which classifies the channel degradation level and determines which alternatives to be adapted in order to combat specific blockage phenomenon. Blockage level is first translated into and related to transmission link parameters in terms of total carrier power to noise ratios, from which the methods of bit rate reduction, modem density increasing, and higher encoding rate are brought forth. A blockage identifier and the optimal smearing technique are used. Frequency-diversity and space-diversity, a method for combating complete blockage and an adaptive programmable channel equalization technique independent of channel characteristics are described. A cascading technique is taught to improve significantly false- and miss-detection probabilities. Performance measure criteria are established for comparison and evaluation utilization in terms of efficiency and blocking mitigation error probability.",
        "This invention provides solutions to the most severe and demanding environments encountered in information transmission: whether with wires or wireless, or whether it is with local area networks, satellites, or deep space communications. The solutions apply to transmission channels including additive white Gaussian, multipath, Rayleigh, and Ricean fading. For satellite orbits, the solutions are applicable to Geo-synchronous earth orbit (GEO), Medium earth orbit (MEO), and Low earth orbit (LEO).",
        "This invention is based on two types of detection and re-transmission schemes. The first scheme determines the blockage severity and classifies it into categories. The second scheme is used to combat complete transmission blockage. Each category consists of a number of blockage mitigation alternatives. Specific implementation designs are included for both types.",
        "Blockage levels are first translated into transmission link parameters, from which the methods of bit rate reduction, increasing modem density, or system bandwidth, or higher encoding rate are derived. Among the alternatives, the methods of improvements in frequency-diversity, space-diversity, and adaptive programmable channel equalization are brought forth.",
        "For blockage due to low signal-to-noise ratio, a method of cascading bits, symbols, and frames enhances significantly the performances of acquisition and synchronization in the beginning of information transmission.",
        "Depending on the degree and duration of blockage, the following factors contributing to transmission blockage need to be characterized: (a) Message traffic congestion, transmission channel capacity, satellite transponder and earth terminal limitations in terms of power and bandwidth; (b) Transmission media such as fading, reflection, shadowing, multi-path, channel symmetry, intentional interferences (jamming), unintentional interferences as adjacent channel, co-channel, inter-symbol, and other short-term and long-term propagation phenomena; and (c) Complete blockage.",

        "The solution methods of this invention are independent of, and applicable to all the transmission systems, wired or wireless, optical cables or satellites with different transmission carrier frequencies.",
        "The solution methods of this invention are applicable to transmitters and receivers of unequal capabilities in the network.",
        "This invention converts transmission blockage problems into error producing problems. It also introduces system concepts and implementation methods, and advances the unique new applications of Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) and Forward Error Correction (FEC).",
        "An adaptive system design utilizing the present invention can be automatically realized with switchable short-term, mid-term, long term, and complete blockage categories. The solutions can be easily and cost effectively implemented as demonstrated. System optimization can be achieved by means of dynamic-probabilistic programming at each term category separately.",
        "Signal Acquisition Under Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio: Information detection begins with acquisition. There are three levels of acquisition: bit, carrier, and frame. This part of the invention applies to all three and in particular to frame or sequence acquisition. The performance of acquisition/synchronization is characterized by detection probabilities. FIGS. 1 and 2 are the calculated values of the detection probabilities with respect to the sequence length n, channel bit error rate p, number of tolerable error tE. set in the detector, and the number of frame cascading times \u03b1. The actual scheme is expected to perform better than the average calculated values.",
        "Channel Detection, Monitoring, and Adaptation: The key characteristic begins with the strategies of transmission channel monitored through the ARQ scheme such as with BCH (31,21,5) code. Transmission is classified in terms of short-term, long-term, and complete blockages. For each blockage classification except complete blockage a number of specific techniques are illustrated. Once a channel classification is determined, adaptation takes place by switching to the corresponding method of mitigation.",
        "Combating Transmission Media Short-term Blockage: When no error is detected, positive acknowledgement (ACK) is transmitted from a receiving terminal; otherwise, negative acknowledgement (NCK) is sent. For blockage less than \u03a9 number of NCKs, three alternatives are: transmission rate reduction, increasing in modem density and/or increasing the encoding rate.",
        "Combating Transmission Media Mid-term Blockage: At any transmission speed, if the data is missing more than \u03a9 but less than \u03a6 number of NCKs, the following provides a solution: Using two modems and an adaptive cancellator, channel blockages can be identified, time smearing techniques can be optimized through unique sequence generation and implemented with specified characteristics.",
        "Combating Transmission Media Long-term Blockage: If the response or no response is greater than \u03a6 but less than X number of NCKs, techniques are provided to minimize antenna sidelobes for compacting space diversity by means of precise relative phase array antenna locations. Frequency diversity and beam polarization can be improved by minimizing the effect of aliasing (distortion due to spectral overlap), which degrades transmission quality when signals are closely packed for bandwidth conservation. A simple procedure demonstrates the elimination of aliasing without guesswork and then the approach of adaptive programmable channel equalization is introduced.",
        "Combating Complete Blockage: Regardless the type of transmission channel, level of blockage, or for any other reason, when the number of NCK counts reaches X, transmission is considered ceased or is completely blocked for an extensive time due to an unpredictable environment. Under this condition, a simple and effective method is introduced without additional equipment.",

By counting the number of NCKs 17, a transmission channel may be monitored into three blockage states: short-term 19, mid-term 18, long-term 21, and complete blockages 23. The numbers of NCK's to determine the states can be changed to fit a particular transmission channel condition. Except for the case of complete blockage 23, each state consists of alternative methods 1 to 8 to combat information blocking. Not all alternatives need to be implemented. After the channel is identified, an alternative method is selected, and the method is then adapted 26. Variations of ARQ operations are based on: Stop-and-Wait, Selective Repeat, Go-back-n, and Continuous. The first one is used for complete blockage 23. The last one is selected for channel monitoring 15. Thus the channel is monitored constantly. These functions are diagrammed in FIG. 3.",
        "Adaptation and Transmission Control: The functions of adaptation are to identify, select, and switch the appropriate mitigation scheme matching with channel condition at that particular time. Known channel statistics and specific satellite parameters, including rate of transmission, will determine how many times the NCK test signals are needed. Adaptation state of short-term is less than \u03a9 NCKs between two ACKs; long-term is greater than \u03a6 NCKs; mid-term is between short- and long-term. After X numbers of NCKs between two ACKs, a complete blockage is declared. Once the blocking state is determined by counting the number of NCKs, adaptation strategies will be performed automatically by switching to the methods as described in FIG. 3.

In encoding, the message 37 is transmitted and stored in the Buffer 39 for retransmission. From the message the Encoder 31 generates the corresponding parity digits. The Control Gate 41 provides timing for the segments of message and parity checks. At the Detector 33 as shown in FIG. 5, the message is received through S1 43 feeding into the Encoder Replica 35, where the parity checks are regenerated based on the received messages. As soon as the received message block is completed, the received parity checks are switched to S2 45 from S1 43. The switches can be easily implemented with timed AND and NAND gates. The Modulo-2 addition can be done either bit by bit, or by using a bank of 10-bit Mod-2 comparator.",

As an example for illustration, the non-standardized (n=31, k=21, d=5) code needs to be used for compatibility reason, which will be clarified in the Section: Combat Channel Errors by Embedment of FEC in ARQ. FIG. 6 shows the Encoder 31. The encoder configuration is determined by the code generator polynomial g(x), which is derived from the product of two minimum polynomials m1(x)=1+x2+x5 and m3(x)=+x2+X3+X4+X5. g(x)=m1(x)m3(x)=+x3+x5+x6+x8+x9+x10.

(C/N) is the combined transmitting and receiving carrier-to-noise ratios, which are determined by the antenna gains of both transmission and receiving antennas. Eb/N0 is required to maintain a desired quality communication. Most modulators and de-modulators are specified in terms of Eb/N0 and bit error rate.

        "Time Smearing 4: Time Smearing is recognized by NASA, JPL, and Motorola and suggested by CES of New Zealand. The purpose of this section is to provide an optimal algorithm, derived from its combinatorial set roots. The expected optimal results are the quick generation of large number of sequences for smearing, simple implementation, thus low cost. From its mathematical roots, the algorithm has been proved to be optimum for multi-user and multi-functional (multiple access, user identification, encryption/decryption, spectrum spreading, and time smearing) communication network designs. Steps 1-5 are for the generation of a special set [D} of n elements d's. Two finite fields F0=GF(n=pm) with n elements and F1=GF(n2=p2m) with n2 elements can be constructed. Next, get a set of primitive polynomials f(x) over GF(p). Identify the non-zero elements of the corresponding finite field F1 in terms of the primitive element a satisfying a primitive polynomial f0(\u03c3) of degree 2m. Form two sets of integers z=1, 2, . . . , n; and k=0, 1, . . . , n\u22122. Each value of z provides a {D}. Choose a value of z and run through the k values in: d(z, k)=z+k(n+1). The elements of {D} are the set of exponents dk+1, i.e. exponents of \u03c3. The exponents can be obtained from d(z, k) through the element \u03c3. For n=3, {D}={0,3,1}.",

All the rows of [U]i,j are the desirable sequences with prescribed properties for non-binary implementation such as using frequency synthesizers, frequency dividers, and delay units. As an example, number of symbols=n3, number of Steps 6-9 generate three matrices Let [W]0, [W]1, and [M] with the d's from Step 5.

To reduce these types of blockages, two techniques, frequency spacing and non-linear mathematical programming, are used. When blockage occurs similar to intentional interferences such as jamming, two different de-modulators can be designed to eliminate or minimize such blockages.",
        "Let d(t), i(t), n(t) be the data, interference, and noise sequences. The design of the BIer 81 may proceed, as shown in FIG. 7(a,b,c). Let the modulating signal, in general, be denoted as a function of the carrier, the data sequence, and the blockage as: m(t)=F[\u03c90t, d(t), b(t)]. After the channel noise n(t), the received signal is: m\u2032(t)=m(t)+n(t)=F[(\u03c90t, d(t), b(t), an(t), fn(t), Qn(t)], where an(t), fn(t) and Qn(t) are the amplitude, frequency, and phase noises due to n(t). In demodulation the noises are assumed less significant than blockage, which needs to be identified first and then removed.",
        "The BIer 81 consists of two not identical demodulators 83, 84 as shown in FIG. 7-a, an Adaptive Cancellator 82, which in turn consists of MSF (multiplication, sampling, and filtering) Correlators 85, a Transversal Equalizer 86, as shown in FIG. 7-b, which consists an equal interval tapped delay line with weighting function W, and a summing circuit for all the weights. The delay is inversely proportional to the bandwidth of the input signal, which is the output from DEMOD I 83. The weighting elements control the amplitude and polarity of the delayed signal and the summing circuit combines the set of delayed signals. The adaptive Cancellator 82 also consists of a Differential Adaptor 87, which in turn consists of a low pass filter (LPF) 88, a threshold level detector 89, and a comparator 90 as shown in FIG. 7-c.",
        "Then blockage b\u2032(t) can be identified as: DEMOD I 83 is a conventional carrier remover, and removes only the carrier frequency \u03c90t. Thus at the output of Demod I 83, both the estimated sequences d\u2032(t) and b\u2032(t) remain. If DEMOD II 84 is designed to reject (not yet identified) b(t), only the estimated d\u2033(t) should appear at the output of DEMOD II 84. The Adaptive Cancellator 82 then takes the outputs from the two demodulators as it inputs. The objective of the Identifier is to cancel the two demodulated input data sequence d\u2032(t) and d\u2033(t). If d\u2032(t)=d\u2033(t), then the data sequence is expected to be completely canceled. What remains at the output of the Adaptive Cancellator is just the error sequence e(t), which turns into blockage b\u2032(t) after proper detection. The function of the Adaptive Cancellator equalizes the mismatches between the two demodulated data sequences so that the cancellation can be effective. If the cancellation is not perfect, than a threshold level detector 89 can be provided to tolerate a pre-determined amount of impairments.",

        "Diversity schemes may be used effectively to ease blockage. For satellite communications as an example, frequency allocations, spatial separations, time divisions, polarization, and angle, mode, and/or phase variations can achieve diversity. The problem of diversity application depends on the multiple satellite/earth station antennas, locations of the antennas, system parameters, and transmission channel characteristics, including rain and propagation phenomena, blockage level, and duration.",
        "Space Diversity 6: Multiple antennas to achieve space diversity are well known. But closely packed mobile antennas are often desirable in information transmission. When the distances of the antennas are too close, transmission quality degrades due to antenna sidelobes. When the military is on the move, multiple on-the-move terminals are available. If relative distances among the terminals can be maintained at about the same speed of motion, antennas arrays can be formed to minimize (and in principle eliminate) sidelobes, thus it can be used to combat long-term channel degradation.",
        "Without the advantage of smart antennas, this method to minimize sidelobe effect is originated by David Leeper in his doctorate dissertation. A difference-set [D} with parameters n, k, \u03bb can be obtained with k elements. Each of the elements determines the location of a mobile antenna. For example, {D}={0,1,3} with n=7, k=3, and \u03bb=1 as parameters, the corresponding 3 terminal T locations in the 7 spaces are: T, T, 0, T, 0, 0, 0. The expected sidelobe amplitude is 2/(7d), where d is a spacing distance, the main lobe is 9/(7d), and the aperture is 6d. In general, the sidelobe is (k\u2212\u03bb)/nd, the main lobe is [k+(n\u22121) \u03bb]/nd. The ratio of sidelobe to main lobe is (n\u2212k)/k(n\u22121).",

Superceded by the earlier works of Babcock, Edwards, Durkin, Fang, Green, Hirata, Sandrin and Welti, this invention advances the following: Minimization of the third order inter-modulation products for optimal frequency spacing is possible if and only if there exist a simple difference set {D}={d0, d1, . . . dk\u22121} with parameters n, k, \u03bb=1. The total frequency needed is n, the number of frequencies can be assigned is k, and the frequency assignment is precisely according to the elements of {D}.

        "Adaptive Programmable Channel Equalization 8: Equalization techniques are not new. But the programmable method used in conjunction with blockage mitigation is. All equalizers can adapt to limited channel equalization for performance improvement. By using multiple such limited capabilities to match the channel conditions with automatic programming, the fundamental idea of equalization is elevated to a different level with unique useful application. Using delay D-transform, the sampled impulse response of the baseband transmission channel is X(D). The new approach is sample X(D) during the long-term (L) blockage. Break L into i sub-intervals. Each sampled xi(D) is adapted with a corresponding zi(D), such that zi(D) is the inverse of xi(D), or xi(D)*zi(D)=1 for all i times in the L-interval. zi(D) can be either software or hardware designed to adaptively match xi(D) for each i. Let i=2 as an example, if x2(D)=1+x(D), the inverse is 1/[1+x(D)]=1+xD+x2D2+ . . . is a convergent series for xD<1. Then the second stage equalizer z2(D) can be designed with x=\u00bd as: 1\u2212D/2+D2/4\u2212D3/8+D4/16\u2212D5/32. The coefficients of the D's are the tap gains of the equalizer for i=2.

        "For combating complete blockage, the method of Stop-and-wait ARQ is used. The transmitter periodically transmits packetized protocols, and the intended receiver periodically sends ACK. Regardless of the presence types of channel errors or interferences, when the transmitter does not receive any acknowledgement from a receiver for a specified long time and a pre-determined number of NCKs X, the transmitter instantly stops transmitting. Depending on the round trip time delays, the amount of message is stored in the transmitter. Regardless of how long the complete blockage may be, the transmitter will not transmit until the channel is restored through an ACK from the receiver. What happens if errors exist after the transmission is restored, or if a few channel errors cause misidentity of the blockage states? The solution is provided in the following:",

        "Blockage Mitigation System Error Probability:",
        "This invention is based on the examples of FIG. 3 and generalization of FIG. 9. To evaluate the performance of such system, the following formulations are constructed: As shown in FIG. 3 there are 4 levels of Continues ARQs, a single Stop-and-Wait ARQ, and a single stage of ARQ/FEC embedding. Assuming all counting mechanism does not produce any error, the potential errors can only be occurred at each stage of the ARQs. There exist false and undetected (or missed) detection error events in any error detection arrangement including the sequence detection method described in the beginning of this preferred embodiment for acquisition and synchronization (A/S). Since all ARQ schemes are realized by (n, k, d) codes with parity check matrices H, it is well known that error detection is through the formation and recognition of the syndrome sequence s, with information sequence I, and the corresponding error sequence e. The false detection error probability Pfd occurs when e is zero but s is not. That is, Pfd=p (s\u22600, e=0)=p (s\u22600/e=0) p(e=0). It is not possible to have s\u22600 when e=0. Because s=(I+e) HT, and IHT=0 from the structure of the codes. HT is the transpose of H. Thus p(s\u22600/e=0)=0 and Pfd=0, which is no longer to be considered.\n\nThe undetected errors occur as no detection of errors is made when one or more of errors occurred. This joint error probability is p(s=0, e>0). In terms of code minimum distances d, e>0 consists of two parts: (d\u22121)\u2267e\u22670 and e>d. Therefore, the probability of undetected error is:",
