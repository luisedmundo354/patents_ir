    "title": "Electron source and an image display device including the electron source",
    "abstract": "A precursor to an electron source, having a capability for extending the life of an image display device by substantially preventing 1) a degradation in a degree of vacuum provided in an image display apparatus, 2) short-circuiting between adjacent wire electrodes via a getter, and 3) a degradation in performance characteristics of the electron source, even when used for a long time period. The electron source is for coupling to an image display member to form an image display apparatus, and the image display member is for displaying an image in response to being irradiated by electrons. The precursor preferably comprises a substrate, and an antistatic film provided on a surface of the substrate at a region where electron emitting devices are to be disposed on the precursor to form the electron source, but not on a region of that surface to be coupled to the image display member.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a substrate for forming an electron source, an electron source using the substrate, and an image display device using the electron source.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Two types of electron emitting devices, i.e., thermionic-cathode devices and cold-cathode devices, have been known. For example, surface-conduction-type devices, field-emission-type devices, metal/insulating layer/metal-type devices have been known as the cold-cathode devices.",
        "The surface-conduction-type devices utilize the phenomenon that electron emission occurs by causing a current to flow in a direction parallel to the surface of a small-area thin film formed on a substrate. In the surface-conduction-type devices, electron emitting portions are formed by performing current-supply processing, called current-supply forming, on a conductive film before performing electron emission. That is, the current-supply forming processes supply current by applying a constant DC voltage or a DC voltage that increases at a very slow rate between both ends of a conductive film, to locally destruct or alter the conductive film in order to form electron emitting portions that have a high electric resistance. Cracks are generated at locally destructed, deformed or altered portions of the conductive film. When an appropriate voltage is applied to the conductive film after the current-supply forming, electron emission occurs at portions near the cracks.",
        "An electron-source device includes the above-described electron emitting devices formed on a substrate wherein the electron emitting devices are wired in the form of a simple matrix by a plurality of row-direction wire electrodes and a plurality of column-direction wire electrodes. Particularly, an insulating layer is formed between electrodes at each of portions where the row-direction wire electrodes and the column-direction wire electrodes cross, in order to maintain electrical insulation. The above-described conductive film is formed in order to form electron emitting portions. By supplying current by applying a constant DC voltage or a DC voltage increasing at a very slow rate between both ends of the conductive film, the conductive film is locally destructed or altered in order to form electron emitting portions having a high electric resistance.",
        "A phosphor film including phosphors is formed on a surface of a faceplate (a light-emitting display plate), connected so as to face the electron-source device, opposite to the electron-source device, and phosphors of three primary colors, i.e., red, green and blue, are appropriately coated. A black substance is provided between phosphors constituting the phosphor film, and a metal back made of Al or the like is formed on the phosphor film. The inside of an envelope obtained by connecting the faceplate and the electron-source device using a supporting frame is maintained to a vacuum of about 10\u22126 Torr. In order to provide the substrate with a strength sufficient enough to resist against the atmospheric pressure, a structural supporting member comprising a relatively thin glass plate is provided.",
        "In an image display device in which phosphors are caused to emit light by projecting an electron beam emitted from an electron source onto an appropriate one of phosphors, serving as image display members, it is necessary to maintain the inside of an envelope including the electron source and the image display members of the faceplate in a high vacuum. This is because if a gas is generated within the envelope to increase the pressure within the envelope, the gas adversely influences the electron source to reduce the amount of electron emission although the degree of the influence depends on the type of the gas, and it becomes impossible to display a bright image. In some cases, the generated gas is ionized by the electron beam and damages the electron source due to the collision of the ionized gas with the electron source by being accelerated by an electron field for accelerating electrons. Alternatively, discharge may occur within the envelope, to sometimes destruct the device.",
        "Usually, the envelope of the image display device is assembled by using a glass supporting frame and bonding connection portions by frit glass or the like, and the inside of the envelope is evacuated to a vacuum of about 10\u22127 Torr by connecting the inside of the envelope to a vacuum pump via an exhaust tube. Then, the exhaust tube is sealed. The vacuum after the sealing is maintained using a getter provided within the envelope. That is, a getter film is formed at a predetermined position within the envelope. The getter film is formed by heating and evaporating a getter material having, for example, Ba as a main component according to high-frequency heating. The inside of the envelope is maintained at a vacuum of about 10\u22126 Torr according to the adsorption function of the getter film.",
        "In the above-described image display device, if a voltage is applied to electron emitting devices via external terminals, provided outside of the envelope, via the plurality of row-direction wire electrodes and the plurality of column-direction wire electrodes formed on the substrate for forming an electron source, an electron beam is emitted from each of the electron emitting devices. At the same time, by applying a high voltage of several tens of kV to the metal back formed on the phosphor film of the faceplate via a terminal provided outside of the envelope, the emitted electron beam is accelerated to impinge onto the phosphor film of the faceplate. The phosphors of the respective colors constituting the phosphor film are thereby excited to emit light, so that an image is displayed.",
        "In some cases, in order to block diffusion of Na, a layer having SiO2 as a main component is formed on a substrate containing Na, and an antistatic layer is formed on the substrate in order to prevent charging on the surface of the substrate.",
        "However, the above-described image display device has the following problems.",
        "First, the above-described coated layer formed on the substrate for forming an electron source may cause difficulty in maintaining the high-vacuum state within the envelope formed by connecting the substrate and the faceplate via the supporting frame, depending on the state of formation of the coated layer. It is estimated that this is because the inside of the coated layer may have gas permeability.",
        "Second, the getter provided on the coated layer within the envelope in order to maintain a vacuum within the envelope may cause a short circuit between adjacent wire electrodes, even if the coated layer is made of an insulator. It is estimated that this is because a large number of bubbles are sometimes formed in the coated layer depending on the state of formation of the coated layer, and the bubbles are burst during heating at a high temperature to provide a state in which the wire electrodes are exposed. This short circuit may greatly degrade the quality of the formed image. Hence, in the worst case, the production yield of the image display device is degraded by manufacturing failed products.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide precursor to an electron source which has a capability for extending the life of an image display device by preventing (or at least substantially minimizing) 1) a degradation in a degree of vacuum provided in an image display apparatus, 2) a short circuit between adjacent wire electrodes via a getter, and 3) a degradation in the performance characteristics of the electron source, even when used for a long period of time, and also to provide an electron source and an image display device using the precursor.",
        "According to an aspect of the invention, a precursor to an electron source, which achieves the above-described object, is provided. The electron source is for being coupled to an image display member to form an image display apparatus, and the image display member is for displaying an image in response to being irradiated by electrons. According to one embodiment of the invention, the precursor comprises a substrate, and an antistatic film is provided on a surface of the substrate at a region where the electron emitting devices are to be disposed on the precursor to form the electron source, but not on a region of that surface which is to be coupled to the image display member.",
        "According to another aspect of the invention, the above-described object is achieved by a precursor to an electron source, according to another embodiment of the invention, wherein the electron source is for being coupled to an image display member to form an image display apparatus, and the image display member is for displaying an image in response to being irradiated by electrons. The precursor according to this embodiment comprises a substrate, and a sodium blocking film provided on a surface of the substrate at a region where electron emitting devices are to be disposed on the precursor to form the electron source, but not on a region of that surface which is to be coupled to the image display member.",

The peak value of a triangular wave (the peak voltage during current supply forming) is appropriately selected in accordance with the configuration of the electron emitting device. A voltage is applied, for example, for several seconds to several tens of minutes under the above-described conditions. The pulse waveform is not limited to a triangular wave, but any other desired waveform, such as a rectangular wave or the like, may also be adopted. T1 and T2 shown in FIG. 6B may be the same ones as those shown in FIG. 6A. The peak value (the peak voltage during current-supply forming) of the triangular wave may be increased, for example, by a step of 0.1 V. The current-supply forming is terminated when, for example, a resistance corresponding to about 0.1 V is obtained during the pulse interval T2.",
        "It is preferable to perform processing called activation processing for the device subjected to the forming. In the activation processing, the device current If and the emission current Ie greatly change. The activation processing may, for example, be performed by repeating application of a pulse voltage as in the current-supply forming in an atmosphere containing an organic gas. Such an atmosphere can be obtained by introducing an appropriate organic gas into a vacuum obtained by sufficiently evacuating the inside of the envelope 88 by an ion pump or the like. A preferable pressure of the organic gas at that time is appropriately set, because it depends on the type of application, the shape of the envelope 88, the type of the organic substance, and the like. The appropriate organic substance may be selected from aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as alkene and alkyne, aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, amines, phenol, organic acids, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid, and the like. More specifically, a saturated hydrocarbon represented by a composition formula of CnH2n+2, such as methane, ethane, propane or the like, an unsaturated hydrocarbon represented by a composition formula of CnH2n, such as ethylene, propylene or the like, benzene, toluene, methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methylamine, eithylamine, phenol, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, or a mixture of some of these substances preferably may be used.",
        "According to this processing, carbon films 19 (as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B) are deposited from the organic substance present in the atmosphere on the portions of the conductive films 19, and the device current If and the emission current Ie greatly change. The termination of the activation processing is appropriately determined while measuring the device current If and the emission current Ie. The pulse width, the pulse interval, the peak value of the pulse, and the like are appropriately set. The carbon film comprises, for example, graphite (containing so-called HOPG, PG and GC, where HOPG indicates a state of graphite having a substantially perfect crystal structure, PG indicates a state of graphite having a slightly disturbed crystal structure with a crystal grain of about 20 nm, and GC indicates a state of graphite having a further disturbed crystal structure with a crystal grain of about 2 nm), or non-crystalline carbon (indicating amorphous carbon, and a mixture of amorphous carbon and graphite crystallites), and preferably has a thickness equal to or less than 50 nm, and more preferably has a thickness equal to or less than 30 nm.",
        "After sufficiently evacuating the inside of the envelope 88, the organic substance is introduced into the envelope 88 from the gas introducing line 138. Alternatively, an organic substance remaining in a vacuum atmosphere after evacuating the inside of the envelope 88 using an oil diffusion pump or a rotary pump may be introduced from line 138. In some embodiments, a substance other than the organic substance is introduced whenever necessary. By applying a voltage to each electron emitting device in the atmosphere containing the organic substance obtained in the above-described manner, carbon, a carbon compound, or a mixture of carbon and a carbon compound is deposited on the portions of the conductive films 19 (as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B), and the amount of electron emission drastically increases. In the voltage application, voltage pulses may be simultaneously applied to devices connected to wires of one direction connected in the same manner as in the case of the forming.",
        "It is preferable to perform stabilization processing after completing the activation processing. In this processing, the organic substance within the envelope 88 is exhausted. The partial pressure of the organic substance within the envelope 88 in this processing is set to a value with which the above-described carbon and carbon compound are substantially not newly deposited, and preferably is equal to or less than 1.3 \u00d710\u22126 Pa, and more preferably is equal to or less than 3\u00d710\u22128 Pa. When evacuating the inside of the envelope 88, it is preferable to heat the entire envelope 88 in order to ease the exhaust of molecules of the organic substance adsorbed on the inner wall of the envelope 88, and the electron emitting devices. The heating preferably is performed at a temperature within a range of 80-250\u00b0 C., preferably at least 150\u00b0 C., for as long a time period as possible. However, the heating conditions are not limited to these temperatures, and any other appropriate suitable conditions may also be adopted, depending on the size and the shape of the envelope 88, the configuration of the electron emitting devices, and the like. The pressure within the envelope 88 must be as low as possible, preferably equal to or less than 1\u00d710\u22125 Pa, and even more preferably, equal to or less than 1.3\u00d710\u22126 Pa.",
        "It is preferable to maintain the atmosphere when terminating the stabilization processing as the atmosphere during driving. However, the atmosphere is not limited to this atmosphere. If the organic substance is sufficiently removed, sufficiently stable characteristics can be maintained even if the degree of vacuum is more or less degraded. By adopting such a vacuum atmosphere, it is possible to suppress new deposition of carbon or a carbon compound, remove H2O, O2 and the like absorbed on the envelope 88, the substrate and the like, and, as a result, to stabilize the device current If and the emission current Ie.",
        "After providing the desired pressure, the exhaust tube 132 is sealed by being heated and melted by a burner. Gettering processing may be performed in order to maintain the pressure within the envelope 88 after the sealing (coupling of 86, 82 and 81). In this processing, a vacuum deposited film is formed by heating a getter (not shown) disposed at a predetermined position within the envelope 88 according to resistance heating, high-frequency heating or the like, immediately before or after the sealing of the envelope 88. Usually, the getter contains Ba as a main component, and maintains the atmosphere within the envelope 88 according to an absorption function of the vacuum deposited film.",
        "When disposing the getter, it is preferable to provide the first layer 7 and the second layer 6 on the substrate 1 (as shown in FIG. 1), except for a region 100 of the substrate 1 where the getter is disposed.",
        "As described above, in the precursor to an electron source according to the present invention, since the first layer 7 and the second layer 6 are formed, it is possible to prevent degradation of characteristics of the electron source caused by diffusion of Na from the substrate into the electron emitting devices 76.",
        "Furthermore, since the second layer 6 and the first layer 7 are formed on the substrate 1, except for a region of the substrate 1 which is sealed to a supporting member 82 and/or a region where the getter film is disposed, the supporting frame 82 is directly connected to the glass surface of the substrate 1, using frit at the sealing region. Hence, air is not leaked from the second layer 6 containing voids into the envelope 88. As a result, the degree of vacuum within the envelope 88 does not decrease with time, so that the life of the electron source can be prolonged.",
        "By providing the first layer 7 and the second layer 6 on the surface of the substrate 1 where the electron emitting devices 76 are to be disposed, but not on a region 100 of the substrate 1 where the getter film is disposed, bubbles are not generated within the insulating layer even if heating processing as high as 300\u00b0 C. is performed at post-processing, and short-circuiting between adjacent wire electrodes 73 via the getter due to formation of the getter film caused by exposure to the wire electrodes 73 from insulating layer 101 cannot occur.",
        "While the present invention has been described with respect to what are presently considered to be the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the scope of the invention is not limited to only the disclosed embodiments. To the contrary, the present invention is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest reasonable interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions."
