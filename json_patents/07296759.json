        "One fairly common characteristic of such spray guns is a threaded ring at the front of the spray gun for retaining on the front end of the spray gun an air cap, nozzle, or the like, necessary for the proper operation of the spray gun. A problem associated with such threaded rings is that they can be overtightened. Overtightening may make it difficult to remove the threaded ring if it should be necessary or desirable to remove the air cap, nozzle, or the like which the threaded ring is holding on the spray gun, for example, to clean it, repair it or replace it. Additionally, overtightening the air cap, nozzle, or the like can distort the shape of the air cap, nozzle, or the like. Such distortion can change the physical, spatial relationships of the various orifices provided by such an air cap, nozzle, or the like. Changing the spatial relationships of such orifices can adversely impact the quality of atomization of the coating material being dispensed from such a spray gun. This, in turn, can adversely impact the coating provided by the dispensed coating material.",

Rearwardly from second lip 110, housing 64 includes a somewhat larger diameter right circular cylindrical region 120 bounded by a surface 122, then a somewhat larger diameter right circular cylindrical region 124 bounded by a surface 126. The rearwardmost portion of region 124 is internally threaded as indicated at 130.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 15-17, retaining nut 66 includes a forward, generally right circular cylindrical portion 132, externally threaded to engage the threads 130 of housing 64 in the assembled retaining ring 30. Rearwardly from portion 132, retaining nut 66 includes a flange 134, the outside dimension of which is generally the same as the outside dimension of housing 64, thereby providing a reasonably smooth outside surface to the assembled retaining ring 30. The inside dimension of flange 134 is small enough to rotatably capture ratcheting ring or clutch ring 60 in the assembled retaining ring 30. The back side of flange 134 is provided with a pair of diametrically spaced notches 136 for inserting prongs of a wrench to tighten retaining nut 66 into housing 64 during assembly of the retaining ring 30.",
        "In assembly, first ratcheting plate or clutch plate 62 is inserted into housing 64 and tabs 92 into engagement in notches 118 and pawls 98 pointing rearwardly. This fixes ratcheting plate or clutch plate 62 against rotation relative to housing 64. Then ratcheting ring or clutch ring 60 is inserted into housing 64 with pawls 74 pointing forwardly, and pawls 74 are brought into engagement with selected pawls 98 on ratcheting plate or clutch plate 62. The fingers 72 flex at the desired torque to permit relative movement between the camming faces 78 and 102, respectively, of pawls 74 and 98, respectively, to provide the torque limiting tightening feature of retaining ring 30 which reduces the likelihood of overtightening of retaining ring 30 and the consequent distortion of the spatial relationships of the various orifices in the nozzle 24 and air cap 28, or other damage to the front end of spray gun 18. Finally, threads 130 and 132 are engaged and threaded tight to complete the assembly of retaining ring 30. The driving faces 76 and 100 of pawls 74 and 98, respectively, engage when the housing 64 is turned in a direction to disengage retaining ring 30 from threads 82 on spray gun 18.",
        "The retaining ring 30 that limits the amount of torque that may be applied to ratcheting ring or clutch ring 60. This, in turn, limits the force that may be applied to the air cap 28 and/or nozzle 24 by the retaining ring 30. This reduces the likelihood of deformation of the air cap 28 and/or nozzle 24, such as would alter the spatial relationships of the various orifices 26, 32, 34, 38 and the like of the air cap 28 and/or nozzle 24 that might otherwise adversely impact the quality of atomization of the coating material being dispensed from such a spray gun 18. The ratcheting ring or clutch ring 60 and ratcheting plate or clutch plate 62 implement a torque override device that permits the ratcheting ring or clutch ring 60 to slip once the override torque of the ratcheting ring or clutch ring 60 and ratcheting plate or clutch plate 62 is reached when the housing 64/ratcheting plate or clutch plate 62 assembly is turned in a direction to tighten the retaining ring 30 on the front of spray gun 18. The ratcheting ring or clutch ring 60 does not slip when turned in a direction to loosen the retaining ring 30 on the front of spray gun 18."
