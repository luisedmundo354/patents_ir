        "The present invention relates to a golf club head, more particularly to a joint structure of a metal part made of a metal material and a FRP part made of a fiber reinforced resin.",
        "In recent years, golf club heads made of a metal material and fiber reinforced resin have been proposed.",
        "The laid-open Japanese utility model application JP-U5-51374 discloses a club head made of a metal material or a fiber reinforced resin, wherein the crown portion is cut out to form a window which can be either left opened or closed by a cover made of a lower specific gravity material.",
        "The laid-open Japanese patent application JP-P2003-62130A discloses a club head formed by integrating a face component made of a metal material and having a turnback along the edge thereof, and an aft-body made of a plurality of plies of prepreg. As shown in FIG. 21, the turnback (a1) of the face component (a) and the front edge portion (b1) of the aft-body (b) are spliced.",
        "In a golf club head having such a spliced structure, the spliced portion is subjected to a large sharing force as the face portion receives a large impact force, and the bonded surface is very liable to come unstuck. This is especially true in case of a large-sized hollow golf club head such as wood-type golf club heads because the wall thickness is thin and thus deformation at impact is relatively large.",
        "It is therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a golf club head, in which the joint portion is increased in the strength, and thereby the durability of the club head is improved.",
        "According to one aspect of the present invention, a hollow golf club head is composed of a metal part made of at least one kind of metal material and a FRP part made of a fiber reinforced resin, the metal part having a first lap joint part, and the FRP part having a second lap joint part being lap-jointed with the first lap joint part, wherein one of the first lap joint part and second lap joint part is provided with at least one securing hole, and the other is provided with at least one protrusion engaging with the at least one securing hole.",
        "Therefore, the strength of the lap joint is greatly increased by the mechanical engaging force between the securing hole and protrusion in addition to the bonding force which will be generated between the surface of the metal part and the surface of the FRP part by means of an adhesive agent, welding (melting) of the matrix resin or the like. Thus, the durability of the club head can be improved, and a further decrease in the material thickness becomes possible which will lead to not only a weight reduction but also a possibility of a large elastic deformation at impact to improve the rebound performance.",

        "FIG. 19 is an exploded perspective view showing another example of the metal part whose face portion is formed by a separate face plate.",
        "FIG. 20 is a diagrammatic cross sectional view of a head for explaining the depth of the center of gravity and the sweet spot height of a club head.",
        "FIG. 21 is a cross sectional view showing a conventional joint between a metal part and a FRP part.",
        "Embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",
        "In the drawings, club head 1 according to the present invention is a wood-type club head such as #1 driver and fairway wood. The club head 1 comprises: a face portion 3 whose front face defines a club face 2 for striking a ball; a crown portion 4 intersecting the club face 2 at the upper edge 2a thereof; a sole portion 5 intersecting the club face 2 at the lower edge 2b thereof; a side portion 6 between the crown portion 4 and sole portion 5 which extends from a toe-side edge 2t to a heel-side edge 2e of the club face 2 through the back face of the club head; and a neck portion 7 to be attached to an end of a club shaft (not shown).",
        "The volume of the club head 1 is set in a range of not less than 300 cc, preferably not less than 350 cc, more preferably 350 to 600 cc, still more preferably 370 to 550 cc. The head 1 has a cavity (i) immediately behind the face portion 3, and in the following embodiments, the cavity (i) is left void although it is also possible to fill it with a light-weight material such as foamed plastic, foamed rubber or the like. The combination of such a large head volume and hollow structure can improve the ball hitting sound because it can enhance high-frequency components of the ball hitting sound, and prolong the reverberation time of such enhanced sound.",
        "For example, when the head volume of more than 300 cc, the depth GL of the center of gravity is preferably set in the range of not less than 35 mm, preferably not less than 37 mm, more preferably not less than 38 mm, but not more than 43 mm. The height GH of the center of gravity G is preferably set in the range of not less than 25 mm, but not more than 35 mm, preferably not more than 32 mm, more preferably not more than 30 mm. In case of a club head all made of metal material(s), it is very difficult to make a club head having such specifications, while achieving practical durability. However, according to the present invention, it is easy to make such a golf club head. By setting the depth GL of the center of gravity more than 35 mm, the sweet spot area of the head is remarkably increased, and the directionality may be improved. Further, as the height GH of the center of gravity is low, it becomes easer to decrease the backspin and to increase the launching angle of the ball and thereby to obtain an ideal ballistic course.",
        "Here, as shown in FIG. 20, the depth GL of the center of gravity G is the horizontal distance between the center of gravity G and the leading edge LE of the head 1 measured in the standard state. The standard state is such that the club head is set on a horizontal plane HP satisfying its lie angle and loft angle. The height GH of the center of gravity G (or sweet spot height) is a vertical height GH measured from the horizontal plane HP to the sweet spot SS in the standard state. The sweet spot SS is defined as a point at which a straight line drawn normally to the club face 2 from the center of gravity G intersects the club face 2.",
        "The club head 1 is composed of a metal part M1 and a FRP part M2 attached to the metal part M1.",
        "The metal part M1 comprises a face wall 9, a sole wall 10 and a side wall 11 forming at least part of the face portion 3, sole portion 5 and side portion 6, respectively, and the neck portion 7, whereby its top is opened and the metal part M1 has an opening O1.",
        "The metal part M1 is made of at least one kind of metal material having a large specific tensile strength. For example, titanium alloys such as alpha+beta titanium alloys and beta titanium alloys are preferred. Specifically, Ti-6Al-4V, Ti-4.5Al-3V-2Fe-2Mo, Ti-2Mo-1.6V-0.5Fe-4.5Al-0.3Si-0.03C, Ti-15V-3Cr-3Al-3Sn, Ti-15Mo-5Zr-3Al, Ti-15Mo-5Zr-4Al-4V, Ti-15V-6Cr-4Al, Ti-20V-4Al-1Sn and the like can be preferably used. However, aside from titanium alloys, various metal materials, e.g. aluminum alloy, pure titanium, stainless steel and the like can be used. The metal part M1 shown in FIGS. 5 and 8 is formed as a casting of a metal material, e.g. Ti-6Al-4V, utilizing a lost-wax precision casting method.",
        "The face wall 9 is to form at least 60% of the club face 2 in area, also forming the entire thickness from the club face 2 to the back face 2B. In this example, in view of the durability and high-pitched hitting sound, the face wall 9 forms substantially 100% of the club face 2.",
        "The thickness of the face wall 9 or face portion 3 can be a substantially constant value. But, in this embodiment, to achieve a balance between durability and rebound performance, the thickness is increased in a central region 9a in comparison with the surrounding peripheral zone 9b.",
        "The thickness Tc in the central region 9a is set in a range of not less than 2.5 mm, preferably more than 2.7 mm, but not more than 3.0 mm, preferably less than 2.9 mm.",
        "The thickness Tp in the peripheral zone 9b is set in a range of not less than 2.0 mm, preferably more than 2.3 mm, but not more than 2.5 mm.",
        "It is preferable that the peripheral zone 9b has such a width that the area of the peripheral zone 9b is in a range of about 20% to about 50% of the area of the central region 9a.",
        "The sole wall 10 extends backwards from the lower edge of the face wall 9 to form at least a major front part of the sole portion 5.

Thus, on the toe-side and heel-side of the head, the lap joint 14, 15 bridges between the crown portion 4 and side portion 6. Such a bridging part can increase the joint strength and the strength of the FRP part.",

        "The second lap joint part F2 is provided with protrusions 8b. In order that the protrusions 8b can fit to the above-mentioned securing holes 8a provided on the first lap joint part F1, the positions and shapes thereof are so determined.",
        "In order to make the FRP part M2, a molding method using prepregs can be employed, for example as shown in FIGS. 13(a) and 13(b). Firstly, as shown in FIG. 13(a), prepregs P are applied to the outer surface of an inflatable bladder B made of for example rubber or alternatively to the inner surface of the mold Md. The bladder is set in a mold Md, and inflated to press the prepregs onto the inside of the mold. The mold Md is heated to harden the resin. After hardened, the prepregs are demolded, and unnecessary part is trimmed, and according to need, protrusions 8b and/or holes 8a are formed in the second lap joint part F2 by bonding the protrusions with hot-melt adhesive for example, drilling the holes 8a and the like. In view of variation of the thickness or an intended change (design change) in the thickness, the use of the bladder B is preferred because of its higher compatibility.",
        "The prepreg P is as well known in the art a combination of continuous reinforcing fibers that are preimpregnated with a thermoset or thermoplastic organic resin matrix. In this example, epoxy resin is used as a matrix resin. The fibers in a prepreg P may be oriented toward one direction or orthogonal directions. The prepreg is cut into a specific shape. By laying predetermined number of prepreg sheets one on top of another to have a required thickness, the prepregs are shaped into a specific shape, and the matrix resin is hardened. In case of unidirectional orientation, prepregs P are arranged such that the fibers in a prepreg cross those in the adjacent prepreg. Preferably, the resin content is set in a range of about 20 to 25%.",
        "Here, the resin content is a percentage of the weight of the resin component to the overall weight of the object. The resin content can be obtained as follows. To separate the fibers, the resin matrix is removed from the measuring object by chemically dissolving the resin matrix only. If the measuring object is uncured prepreg, as the chemical, for example methyl ethyl ketone may be used. If the measuring object is a cured FRP material, for example hot nitric acid may be used. Then by subtracting the weight of the fibers from the total weight of the measuring object, the weight of the resin matrix can be obtained.",
        "In addition to the methods using prepregs, an injection molding method using a fluid compound material of short fibers, a resin matrix and additives can be employed to eliminate the need to form the protrusion 8b in separate operation.",
        "After the FRP part M2 and the metal part M1 are made as discrete parts, they are assembled by lap jointing the first and second lap joint parts F1 and F2 with applying an adhesive agent to therebetween and inserting the protrusions 8b into the securing holes 8a.",
        "If the holes 8a and protrusion 8b are too small, it is difficult to improve the shearing strength of the lap joint. If too large, the bonding area of the lap joint becomes decreased and it is difficult to obtain necessary strength and durability. Therefore, the maximum diameter D of the hole 8a and protrusion 8b is preferably set in the range of not less than 2.0 mm, more preferably not less than 3.0 mm, but not more than 8.0 mm, more preferably not more than 5.0 mm.",
        "In addition to a circle, the holes 8a and protrusions 8b can be formed in a shape of an ellipse, elongated circle, polygon and the like. Thus, in case of not round shape, it is preferable to limit the hole in terms of the volume, instead of the diameter D. The volume of a hole 8a is set in a range of not less than 1.5 cu.mm, preferably not less than 5.6 cu.mm, but not more than 102.0 cu.mm, preferably not more than 30.0 cu.mm. Also it is preferable that the percentage of the total area S1 of all the holes 8a to the overall area S of the lap joint part F1 or F2 including the total area S1 is set in the range of not less than 20%, preferably not less than 30%, but not more than 70%, preferably not more than 60%. As a result, a balance between the adhesion force by the adhesive agent and the mechanical engaging force by the protrusion 8b and holes 8a can be achieved, and the strength of the joint can be remarkably increased.",
        "Reversely to the above examples, as shown in FIG. 12, it is possible to form the holes 8a on the second lap joint part F2, and the protrusions 8b on the first lap joint part F1.",
        "Further, it is possible to form both of the holes 8a and protrusions 8b on each of the first and second lap joint parts F1 and F2.",
        "Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 9 in imaginary line, a retainer 8c larger than the hole 8a may be formed at the end of the protrusion 8b in order to increase the resistance to pulling-out.",
        "FIG. 14 shows a modification of the above-mentioned second lap joint part F2 which may be adopted in every type of FRP part M2, but preferably combined with the first lap joint part F1 with the through-hole type securing holes 8a.",
        "In this example, the second lap joint part F2 is two-forked in the cross section, namely, this part F2 is provided with an inner lip F2i which is positioned on the inside of the first lap joint part F1, and thus the first lap joint part F1 is held between the inner lip F2i and the outside part F2o on the outside of the first lap joint part F1.",
        "When this two-forked type second lap joint part F2 is formed on the above-mentioned discrete-type FRP part M2, it is preferable that the outside part F2o is provided with downwardly or inwardly protruding outer protrusions 8bo, and the inner lip F2i is provided with upwardly or outwardly protruding inner protrusions 8bi. In the respective securing holes 8a, the outer protrusions 8bo confront with the respective inner protrusions 8bi, and they are bonded each other.",
        "In the above description, the FRP part M2 is first formed separately from the metal part M1, and they are integrated by bonding the lap joint parts F1 and F2.",
        "It is however, also possible to do the formation of the FRP part M2 and its integration with the metal part M1 concurrently within a mold as follows.",
        "Firstly, the metal part M1 is made, wherein a through hole O3 which is utilized to insert a bladder B into the hollow (i) of the metal part M1 is provided in an appropriate position, for example, in the side wall 11 on the toe side as shown in FIG. 15 in full line and FIG. 8 in imaginary line.",
        "Then, an inside prepreg Pi is applied to the inner surface of the first lap joint part F1 as shown in FIG. 15. In this example, the inside prepreg Pi is a sheet having such a size and shape being capable of completely covering the opening O1. The peripheral part of the inside prepreg Pi is temporarily fixed to the inside of the first lap joint part F1, using the adhesive agent 16. To apply and locate the inside prepreg Pi accurately, a rod, lever or the like inserted in the through hole O3 can be used. Instead, an inflatable bladder inserted into the hollow (i) can be used to press the inside prepreg Pi onto the first lap joint part F1.",
        "On the outside of the inside prepreg Pi, an outside prepreg Po is applied to the outer surface of the first lap joint part F1 so as to completely cover the opening O1. The outside prepreg Po is a single sheet having a size and shape being capable of completely covering the opening O1. Between the peripheral part of the outside prepreg Pi and the outer surface of the first lap joint part F1, an adhesive agent 17 is again used to temporarily fix each other.",
        "In this example, between the inside prepreg Pi and outside prepreg Po, an adhesive agent is not used. But, if need be, it is possible to use an adhesive agent.",
        "For the adhesive agents 16, 17, those having superior adhesiveness between the metal material of the metal part M1 and the matrix resin in the inside and outside prepreg Pi and Po, for example, heat-hardening adhesive agents such as epoxy resin adhesives are preferably used.",
        "As shown in FIG. 16, the metal part M1 and prepreg Pi and Po are set in a split mold 18 which comprises for example a upper piece 18a and a lower piece 18b. In the mold 18, the prepregs Po and Pi are heated up to a temperature enough to make plastic deformation, a highly expandable bladder B which is as shown in FIG. 16 put in the hollow (i) through the through hole O3 is inflated by a high-pressure high-temperature gas or steam as shown in FIG. 17. Thus, the expanded bladder B compress the inside prepreg Pi and outside prepreg Po between the surface of the bladder B and the molding face 19 or inner surface of the mold 18a. AS the matrix resin in the prepregs Pi, Po is in a plasticized state, the resin flows to fit to the first lap joint part F1 of the metal part M1, and the resin flows into the securing holes 8b and is hardened to form the protrusions 8b. The matrix resins of the directly contacting inside and outside prepreg Pi and Po are merged and hardened. Thus, they are strongly adhered with each other or integrated.",
        "For that purpose, the content of the resin in each prepreg, namely, that in the FRP part M2 is set in the range of not less than 15%, preferably not less than 20%, but not more than 35%, preferably not more than 30%, more preferably not more than 25% when the matrix resins is fully hardened, the bladder B is deflated and pulled out from the hollow (i). The club head 1 is demolded. The through hole O3 is patched to close.",
        "By the method of molding and integrating a FRP part, the bonding strength between the metal part M1 and FRP part M2 and the durability can be greatly improved.",
        "This method can be employed to make the FRP part M2 without the inner lip F2i as shown in FIG. 9 to 12. In such a case, the inside prepreg Pi is omitted.",
        "FIG. 18 shows another example of the inside prepreg Pi, which is a plurality of relatively short tapes which are applied along the edge of the opening O1 so that for example, its half width protrudes into the opening O1. Thus, the opening O1 is not closed completely. Accordingly, using the remaining opening part O1r, the inside prepreg Pi can be easily applied to the inside of the first lap joint part F1. Aside from the tapes having two ends, the inside prepreg Pi in a form of endless ring may be also used.",
        "In the above examples, the metal part M1 is made of one kind of a metal material, and formed as an integral part. But, it is possible to use two or more kinds of metal materials, and the metal part M1 can be formed by assembling two or more parts which are formed by suitable methods, e.g. casting, forging, pressing, rolling, cutting and the like. As a modification of the above-described metal part M1, it can be made of two or more metal materials having different specific gravity. For example, the sole wall 10 may be formed of a different metal material having a larger specific gravity than the other portion.",
        "FIG. 19 shows such a modification of the metal part M1 similar to the FIG. 8 example, wherein, in stead of the above-mentioned integrated face wall 9, a separate face plate (not shown) is used to form the face portion 3, and thus a front opening O4 which is closed by the attached face plate is formed. Therefore, this front opening O4 can be used to apply the inside prepreg Pi and to insert the bladder B, and thus there is no need to make the above-mentioned opening O3. In this example, the metal part M1 is formed as a casting of a metal material similarly to the former examples shown in FIGS. 5 and 8. But, the face plate is formed by forging a titanium alloy.",
        "In the above embodiments, as described above, as the specific gravity of the FRP part M2 is smaller than the metal part, the weight of the club head can be reduced to redistribute the reduced weight to the sole portion 5 and/or side portion 6 for example. Accordingly, the design freedom is greatly increased which makes it possible to lower and deepen the center of gravity and to increase the moment of inertia of a relatively large-sized hollow club head.",
