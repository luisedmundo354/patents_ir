        "GSK-3 is a serine/threonine protein kinase composed of two isoforms (\u03b1 and \u03b2) which are encoded by distinct genes. GSK-3 is one of several protein kinases which phosphorylates glycogen synthase (GS) (Embi et al Eur. J. Biochem. (107) 519-527 (1980)). The \u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms have a monomeric structure and are both found in mammalian cells. Both isoforms phosphorylate muscle glycogen synthase (Cross et al Biochemical Journal (303) 21-26 (1994)) and these two isoforms show good homology between species (e.g. human and rabbit GSK-3\u03b1 are 96% identical).",
        "Type II diabetes (or Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus, NIDDM) is a multifactorial disease. Hyperglycaemia is due to insulin resistance in the liver, muscle and other tissues coupled with inadequate or defective secretion of insulin from pancreatic islets. Skeletal muscle is the major site for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and in this tissue, glucose removed from the circulation is either metabolised through glycolysis and the TCA cycle, or stored as glycogen. Muscle glycogen deposition plays the more important role in glucose homeostasis and Type II diabetic subjects have defective muscle glycogen storage.",
        "The stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin in skeletal muscle results from the dephosphorylation and activation of glycogen synthase (Villar-Palasi C. and Lamer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta (39) 171-173 (1960), Parker P J et al., Eur. J. Biochem. (130) 227-234 (1983), and Cohen P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. (21) 555-567 (1993)). The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of GS are mediated by specific kinases and phosphatases. GSK-3 is responsible for phosphorylation and deactivation of GS, while glycogen bound protein phosphatase 1 (PP1G) dephosphorylates and activates GS. Insulin both inactivates GSK-3 and activates PP1G (Srivastava A K and Pandey S K Mol. and Cellular Biochem. (182) 135-141 (1998)).",
        "Chen et al Diabetes (43) 1234-1241 (1994) found that there was no difference in the mRNA abundance of PP1G between patients with Type II diabetes and control patients, suggesting that an increase in GSK-3 activity might be important in Type II diabetes. It has also recently been demonstrated that GSK-3 is overexpressed in Type II diabetic muscle and that an inverse correlation exists between skeletal muscle GSK-3\u03b1 activity and insulin action (Nikoulina et al Diabetes 2000, 49 263-271). Overexpression of GSK-3\u03b2 and constitutively active GSK-3\u03b2 (S9A, S9E) mutants in HEK-293 cells resulted in suppression of glycogen synthase activity (Eldar-Finkelman et al., PNAS (93) 10228-10233 (1996)) and overexpression of GSK-3\u03b2 in CHO cells, expressing both insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), resulted in an impairment of insulin action (Eldar-Finkelman and Krebs PNAS (94) 9660-9664 (1997)). Recent evidence for the involvement of elevated GSK-3 activity and the development of insulin resistance and type II diabetes in adipose tissue has emerged from studies undertaken in diabetes and obesity prone C57BL/6J mice (Eldar-Finkelman et al., Diabetes (48) 1662-1666 (1999)).",
        "GSK-3 has been shown to phosphorylate other proteins in vitro including the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-2B at Serine540 (Welsh et al., FEBS Letts (421) 125-130 (1998)). This phosphorylation results in an inhibition of eIF-2B activity and leads to a reduction in this key regulatory step of translation. In disease states, such as diabetes, where there is elevated GSK-3 activity this could result in a reduction of translation and potentially contribute to the pathology of the disease.",
        "Several aspects of GSK-3 functions and regulation in addition to modulation of glycogen synthase activity indicate that inhibitors of this enzyme may be effective in treatment of disorders of the central nervous system. GSK-3 activity is subject to inhibitory phosphorylation by PI 3 kinase-mediated or Wnt-1 class-mediated signals that can be mimicked by treatment with lithium, a low mM inhibitor of GSK-3 (Stambolic V., Ruel L. and Woodgett J. R. Curr. Biol. 1996 6(12): 1664-8).",
        "GSK-3 inhibitors may be of value as neuroprotectants in treatment of acute stroke and other neurotraumatic injuries. Roles for PI 3-kinase signalling through PKB/akt to promote neuronal cell survival are well established, and GSK-3 is one of a number of PKB/akt substrates to be identified that can contribute to the inhibition of apoptosis via this pathway (Pap & Cooper, (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273: 19929-19932). Evidence suggests that astrocytic glycogen can provide an alternative energy source to facilitate neuronal survival under conditions of glucose deprivation (for example see Ransom, B. R. and Fern, R. (1997) Glia 21: 134-141 and references therein). Lithium is known to protect cerebellar granule neurons from death (D'Mello et al., (1994) Exp. Cell Res. 211: 332-338 and Volonte et al (1994) Neurosci. Letts. 172: 6-10) and chronic lithium treatment has demonstrable efficacy in the middle cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke in rodents (Nonaka and Chuang, (1998) Neuroreport 9(9): 2081-2084). Wnt-induced axonal spreading and branching in neuronal culture models has been shown to correlate with GSK-3 inhibition (Lucas & Salinas, (1997) Dev. Biol. 192: 31-44) suggesting additional value of GSK-3 inhibitors in promoting neuronal regeneration following neurotraumatic insult.",
        "Tau and \u03b2-catenin, two known in vivo substrates of GSK-3, are of direct relevance in consideration of further aspects of the value of GSK-3 inhibitors in relation to treatment of chronic neurodegenerative conditions. Tau hyperphosphorylation is an early event in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and is postulated to promote microtubule disassembly. Lithium has been reported to reduce the phosphorylation of tau, enhance the binding of tau to microtubules, and promote microtubule assembly through direct and reversible inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Hong M., Chen D. C., Klein P. S. and Lee V. M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997 272(40) 25326-32). \u03b2-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK-3 as part of a tripartite complex with axin, resulting in \u03b2-catenin being targetted for degradation (Ikeda et al., (1998) EMBO J. 17: 1371-1384). Inhibition of GSK-3 activity is a key mechanism by which cytosolic levels of catenin are stabilised and hence promote \u03b2-catenin-LEF-1/TCF transcriptional activity (Eastman, Grosschedl (1999) Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 11: 233). Rapid onset AD mutations in presenilin-1 (PS-1) have been shown to decrease the cytosolic \u03b2-catenin pool in transgenic mice. Further evidence suggests that such a reduction in available \u03b2-catenin may increase neuronal sensitivity to amyloid mediated death through inhibition of \u03b2-catenin-LEF-1/TCF transcriptional regulation of neuroprotective genes (Zhang et al., (1998) Nature 395: 698-702). A likely mechanism is suggested by the finding that mutant PS-1 protein confers decreased inactivation of GSK-3 compared with normal PS-1 (Weihl, C. C., Ghadge, G. D., Kennedy, S. G., Hay, N., Miller, R. J. and Roos, R. P. (1999) J. Neurosci. 19: 5360-5369).",
        "International Patent Application Publication Number WO 97/41854 (University of Pennsylvania) discloses that an effective drug for the treatment of manic depression is lithium, but that there are serious drawbacks associated with this treatment. Whilst the precise mechanism of action of this drug for treatment of bipolar disorder remains to be fully defined, current models suggest that inhibition of GSK-3 is a relevant target that contributes to the modulation of AP-1 DNA binding activity observed with this compound (see Manji et al., (1999) J. Clin. Psychiatry 60 (suppl 2): 27-39 for review).",
        "GSK-3 inhibitors may also be of value in treatment of schizophrenia. Reduced levels of \u03b2-catenin have been reported in schizophrenic patients (Cotter D, Kerwin R, al-Sarraji S, Brion J P, Chadwich A, Lovestone S, Anderton B, and Everall I. 1998 Neuroreport 9:1379-1383) and defects in pre-pulse inhibition to startle response have been observed in schizophrenic patients (Swerdlow et al (1994) Arch. Gen. Psychiat. 51: 139-154). Mice lacking the adaptor protein dishevelled-1, an essential mediator of Wnt-induced inhibition of GSK-3, exhibit both a behavioural disorder and defects in pre-pulse inhibition to startle response (Lijam N, Paylor R, McDonald M P, Crawley J N, Deng C X, Herrup K, Stevens K E, Maccaferri G, McBain C J, Sussman D J, and Wynshaw-Boris A. (1997) Cell 90: 895-905). Together, these findings implicate deregulation of GSK-3 activity as contributing to schizophrenia. Hence, small molecule inhibitors of GSK-3 catalytic activity may be effective in treatment of this mood disorder.",
        "The finding that transient \u03b2-catenin stabilisation may play a role in hair development (Gat et al Cell (95) 605-614(1998)) suggests that GSK-3 inhibitors could be used in the treatment of baldness.",
        "Studies on fibroblasts from the GSK-3\u03b2 knockout mouse (Hoeflich K P et al., Nature 2000, 406, 86-90) support a role for this kinase in positively regulating the activity of NFkB. This transcription factor mediates cellular responses to a number of inflammatory stimuli. Therefore, pharmacologic inhibition of GSK-3 may be of use in treating inflammatory disorders through the negative regulation of NFkB activity.",
        "We have now discovered that a series of pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines and pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridazines are particularly potent and selective inhibitors of GSK-3. These compounds are indicated to be useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of conditions associated with a need for inhibition of GSK-3, such as diabetes, conditions associated with diabetes, chronic neurodegenerative conditions including dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, subacute sclerosing panencephalitic parkinsonism, postencephalitic parkinsonism, pugilistic encephalitis, guam parkinsonism-dementia complex, Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, Huntingdon's disease, AIDS associated dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and neurotraumatic diseases such as acute stroke, mood disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, promotion of functional recovery post stroke, cerebral bleeding (for example, due to solitary cerebral amyloid angiopathy), hair loss, obesity, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, hypertension, polycystic ovary syndrome, syndrome X, ischaemia, traumatic brain injury, cancer, leukopenia, Down's syndrome, Lewy body disease, inflammation, and immunodeficiency.",

        "3-Amino-5-phenyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridazine (Description 8; 0.15 g, 0.709 mmol was added to the hydrochloride salt of 3-(6-methylpyridin-3-yl)propionyl chloride (0.624 g, 2.84 mmol) in dry pyridine (10 mL) and the mixture heated at reflux overnight. After evaporation to dryness under reduced pressure and further drying under high vacuum the residue was chromatographed on silica gel initially with a gradient elution of 0-10% v/v methanol in dichloromethane, then with a gradient of 5-10% v/v 1N ammonia-methanol in dichloromethane. Fractions containing product were further purified by preparative HPLC on a C18 column, using a gradient elution with 10-90% v/v acetonitrile (containing 0.01% v/v trifluoroacetic acid) and water (containing 0.1% v/v trifluoracetic acid) to give product as the trifluoroacetate salt. A solution of this salt in methanol was passed through an SCX column and washed with methanol (20 mL). The free base of the title compound was obtained after elution with 66% v/v 2N methanolic ammonia in methanol and evaporation to dryness. A solution of the free base in dichloromethane (10 mL) was then treated with a slight excess of 1N hydrochloric acid in diethyl ether to give the product as a solid after evaporation of solvents.",
