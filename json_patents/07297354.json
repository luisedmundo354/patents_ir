        "The present invention generally relates to a method of reducing the antigenicity of vegetable proteins, while also improving the solubility characteristics of the vegetable proteins. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of enzymatically hydrolyzing vegetable proteins, such as raw, natural soy proteins and denatured soy proteins, to reduce the antigenicity of the vegetable proteins while also improving the solubility characteristics of the vegetable proteins.",
        "Over the years, researchers have found that soybeans may be processed to recover or extract a number of valuable components, such as soy protein and soybean oil, from the soy beans. Also, soybeans may be processed to form soy flours high in nutritionally beneficial substances, such as fiber and protein. Such processing of soybeans often include heat treatment for a variety of purposes, such as inactivating destructive enzymes or inactivating compounds responsible for off-flavors that are unpalatable to humans and/or animals.",
        "Soybean processing techniques that employ heat frequently cause denaturation of proteins present in resulting soy component and products. The degree of protein denaturation depends upon the duration of heat and the temperature profile during the heating, among other factors. Additionally, some proteins in soybeans are more susceptible to denaturation at particular heating conditions than are other soybean proteins. Nonetheless, denaturation of soy proteins is problematic since denatured proteins typically exhibit greatly diminished solubility in water and aqueous solutions.",
        "Many soy products, such as soy flour, soy flakes, and soy meal, are available and are commonly used for production of animal feeds and food products for human consumption. However, any such soy products that have been heat processed to a substantial degree have also undergone substantial soy protein denaturation and, consequently, frequently have a Protein Dispersability Index (subsequently referred to as \u201cPDI\u201d) on the order of about 20 or even less. The PDI is a measure of protein solubility (and consequently a measure of protein dispersability) in water. The PDI decreases as the level of protein denaturation in a soy component or product increases, absent further processing of the denatured protein to enhance the solubility of the denatured protein. Though there are vegetable protein products with relative high PDIs of 90 or more, and thus high levels of soluble proteins, these products are typically very expensive and/or often contain high levels of antigenic proteins.",
        "Heat treating of soybeans and soybean components, although beneficial for deactivating destructive enzymes and compounds that contribute to unpalatable tastes, nevertheless do little, if anything, to reduce the antigenicity of the heat-processed soybean products. The antigenicity of a particular substance is directly correlated to the concentration of antigens present in the substance. Glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin, which are commonly referred to as antigenic proteins, are two proteins in soybean products that cause the majority of the antigenicity typically observed in soybean products. Consequently, glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin, by their presence or absence, predominantly control the level of antigenicity of a particular soybean product.",
        "Heat-treating and heat-processing typically do not sufficiently reduce the concentration of antigenic proteins, such as glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin, in a particular proteinaceous material. Other soybean processing techniques exist that may or may not incorporate heat treatment steps. For example, some commercial processing plants employ organic solvents, such as hexane, to extract oil from soy beans or soy products, such as soy flakes. The heat that is applied during the oil extraction process causes some denaturation of protein in the soy products. The heat is typically employed during the oil extraction process for purposes of evaporating the organic solvent. This heating for solvent evaporation purposes may cause some reduction of the antigenic protein concentration, though any such reduction is only an insignificant reduction. The organic solvent, such as hexane, that is employed in these processes for oil extraction purposes typically does not cause the destruction or removal of antigenic proteins, such as glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin. There are other organic solvents that may be employed in these processes for purposes other than oil extraction. Some of these other organic solvents may even bring about significant reductions of the concentration of antigenic proteins, such as glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin, in a particular proteinaceous material.",
        "The destruction of antigenic protein that provides a reduced level of antigenicity in soybean products is important, since antigens, such as antigenic proteins, when introduced into a human being or into an animal, frequently cause production of antibodies that lead to development of allergic reactions that in turn reduce the digestibility of soybean products or cause other nutritional disturbances. Thus, to reduce the opportunity for allergic reactions, it is beneficial to reduce the antigenicity of soybean products by reducing the concentration of antigenic proteins, such as glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin, in the soybean products.",
        "However, soybean processing techniques that rely on organic solvents, even though beneficial for destruction of antigenic proteins, are not an optimum solution to the antigenicity issue. First, reducing the antigenicity of soybean products using such solvent-based processing techniques nevertheless typically leaves the soybean products with high levels of denatured proteins. These high levels of denatured proteins contribute to poor protein solubility characteristics in soybean products produced by solvent-based processing techniques. Furthermore, complete removal of the organic solvent from soybean products produced by solvent-based processing techniques is challenging and often incomplete, since trace levels of the organic solvent typically remain in the soybean product. Consumers are increasingly aware of research studies that raise questions about the effects of trace levels of organic solvents on human health. Therefore, to raise public perception of food quality, it is useful to minimize or even eliminate use of organic solvents in food processing techniques.",
        "However, other than solvent-based processing techniques, heat-based processing techniques that denature proteins while leaving antigenic proteins intact or substantially intact are the most common soybean processing techniques. Furthermore, other processing techniques, such as grinding or milling, though not relying upon heating that denatures proteins, nevertheless, typically leave high and substantial levels of antigenic protein in the processed soybean components.",
        "Thus, there is a need in the food and animal feed manufacturing industries for a technique of processing vegetable protein sources, such as soybeans and soybean components, that reduces the antigenicity in soybean products to reduce the potential for allergic reactions in humans and animals that consume the soybean products. Furthermore, there is a need for a food and animal feed processing technique that improves the solubility, and thus the dispersability, of denatured proteins in vegetable sources of protein, such as soybean products. Enhanced solubility and dispersability of denatured proteins is necessary to allow production of beverages, such as milk substitutes, milk replacers, and infant formulas, that contain proteins derived from vegetable sources, such as soybeans, and to support production of food products and animal feeds that incorporate dispersed or emulsified proteins derived from vegetable sources, such as soybeans. The process of the present invention provides an optimum solution to these needs by providing a product with proteins exhibiting high levels of solubility where the product also contains minimal, if any, levels of antigenic proteins.",
        "The present invention includes a method of treating a proteinaceous material having a first concentration of \u03b2-conglycinin. The method includes combining the proteinaceous material with an enzyme to form a reaction mixture, the reaction mixture initially having a pH of at least about 7.0 standard pH units, allowing the enzyme to hydrolyze \u03b2-conglycinin present in the reaction mixture to form a proteinaceous intermediate, and inactivating the enzyme present in the reaction mixture after a reaction period to form a proteinaceous product. The proteinaceous product produced by the method has a second concentration of \u03b2-conglycinin that is at least 99 percent less than the first concentration of \u03b2-conglycinin. The present invention also includes a method of treating a proteinaceous material, a method of treating a proteinaceous material having a first concentration of glycinin, and a method of treating a proteinaceous material having a first Protein Dispersability Index.",

        "Briefly, the process of the present invention entails the formation of an aqueous slurry of one or more vegetable protein materials to form a slurried vegetable protein feed.

The pH of the slurried vegetable protein feed and the temperature of the slurried vegetable protein feed that are selected such that action of the protease on proteins present in the slurried vegetable protein feed is effective (1) to enhance the level of protein solubility in the slurried vegetable protein product, as compared to the level of protein solubility in the slurried vegetable protein feed, and (2) to reduce the level of antigenicity in the slurried vegetable protein product, as compared to the level of antigenicity in the slurried vegetable protein feed. Preferably, the slurried vegetable protein feed, at an alkaline pH, is subjected to the action of an alkaline proteolytic enzyme at a temperature of about 60\u00b0 C. or less, to produce the slurried vegetable protein product. The slurried vegetable protein product, after preparation, is then heated to inactivate the proteolytic enzyme and is thereafter dried to form a powdered vegetable protein product of the present invention.",
        "The process of the present invention may be beneficially employed to hydrolyze proteins from any source, such as vegetable protein materials, animal protein materials, marine protein materials, and any combination of any of these. Some examples of vegetable protein materials are protein materials derived from soybeans, such as soy protein isolate, toasted or untoasted soy flour, soy grits, soy flakes, soy meal, soy protein concentrates, and any combination of any of these. The vegetable protein material, such as any of the soybean protein sources listed above, maybe defatted, reduced fat, or full fat vegetable protein materials. Some examples of animal protein materials include egg albumin isolate; powdered egg whites; dairy protein materials, such as whey protein isolate, whey protein concentrate, and powdered whey; and any combination of any of these. As with the vegetable protein materials, any animal protein material(s) may be defatted, reduced fat, or full fat in nature. Some examples of marine protein materials include protein-containing materials derived from marine creatures, such as fish. As with the vegetable protein materials and the animal protein materials, any marine protein material(s) may be defatted, reduced fat, or full fat in nature.",

Likewise, it is to be understood that any combination of any protein material, such as any combination of vegetable protein material, animal protein materials, and/or marine protein materials, may be processed in accordance with the present invention, while still realizing benefits of the present invention.",
        "The slurried vegetable protein feed may be prepared by combining the vegetable protein material with water. While the total solids concentration in the slurried vegetable protein feed is not critical to the present invention, the total solids concentration in the slurried vegetable protein feed preferably ranges between about 10 weight percent and about 35 weight percent, based upon the total weight of the slurried vegetable protein feed. Total solids concentrations higher than about 35 weight percent are less desirable because such higher concentrations increase the viscosity of the slurried vegetable protein feed and consequently may cause difficulties in preparing, mixing and/or handling the slurried vegetable protein feed. Total solids concentrations lower than about 10 weight percent in the slurried vegetable protein feed are less preferred, because such lower total solids concentrations would increase the size of equipment needed to accomplish the process of the present invention and would ultimately require removal of greater amounts of moisture to produce the powdered vegetable protein product of the present invention.",

Alternatively, the slurried vegetable protein feed may be circulated from the batch reactor, through a heat exchanger, and back into the batch reactor to heat the slurried vegetable protein feed. As another alternative, the water that is blended with the vegetable protein material to form the slurried vegetable protein feed maybe heated prior to combination of the vegetable protein material and the water. The batch reactor containing the slurried vegetable protein feed should be equipped with an agitator that is capable of maintaining the homogeneity of the slurried vegetable protein feed during preparation, pH adjustment, and enzymatic hydrolysis.",

More preferably, the pH of the slurried vegetable protein feed is adjusted to a pH of about 8.5 standard pH units, or more, such as to a pH of above about 8.5 standard pH units to a pH of about 9.5 standard pH units, since the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction has been observed to enhance protein solubility and/or minimize antigenicity levels when the pH of the slurried vegetable protein feed is adjusted to this more preferred range. Still more preferably, the pH of the slurried vegetable protein feed is adjusted to a pH ranging from about 9.0 standard pH units to about 9.5 standard pH units, such as at a pH of about 9 standard pH units, since the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction has been observed to enhance protein solubility and/or minimize antigenicity levels when the pH of the slurried vegetable protein feed is adjusted to this level.",

        "The acidic agent is preferably an edible, food grade acidic agent. Some examples of suitable edible, food grade, acidic agents include hydrochloric acid and acetic acid.

Furthermore, such pH adjustment or control does not significantly affect the rates at which the beneficial protein solubility enhancement or the beneficial antigenicity reduction are achieved by the process of the present invention minimization. However, despite not needing to control pH during the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction, the temperature of the slurried vegetable protein feed within the batch reactor is maintained at the desired reaction temperature, such as the preferred reaction temperature of about 60\u00b0 C., or less, and agitation is maintained to maintain homogeneity of the contents of the batch reactor during the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction.",

Though those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that this period of time may vary, depending upon the particular proteolytic enzyme(s) employed, the activity of the proteolytic enzyme(s), the temperature of the slurried vegetable protein feed at the onset of, and during, the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction, and other factors, this period of time will, nevertheless, typically range from about 5 minutes to 120 minutes.",
        "Enzymes that are capable of hydrolyzing proteins are commonly referred to as carbonyl hydrolases. In addition to hydrolyzing peptide bonds of proteins, carbonyl hydrolases, depending upon the conditions, are often capable of hydrolyzing peptide bonds of peptides, ester bonds of fatty acids, and ester bonds of triglycerides. As used herein, a protein generally consists of at least about ten individual amino acids, whereas a peptide, which is a protein fragment, generally consists of about two to about nine individual amino acids. There are both naturally-occurring forms of carbonyl hydrolases and recombinant forms of carbonyl hydrolases. Some of the more important types of naturally-occurring carbonyl hydrolases include, for example, lipases, proteases, such as subtilisins and metalloproteases, and peptide hydrolases. Some non-exhaustive examples of peptide hydrolases include alpha-amino acylpeptide hydrolase, peptidyl-amino acid hydrolase, acylamino hydrolase, serine carboxypeptidase, metallocarboxypeptidase, thiol proteinase, carboxyl proteinase and metalloproteinase. Some non-exhaustive exemplary classes of proteases may further include thiol, acid, endo, and exo proteases.",
        "A recombinant carbonyl hydrolase is a carbonyl hydrolase that is not naturally-occurring. A naturally-occurring carbonyl hydrolase is encoded with a naturally-occurring DNA sequence. In a recombinant carbonyl hydrolase, the DNA sequence that would ordinarily encode the carbonyl hydrolase has been modified into a mutant, or non-naturally-occurring, DNA sequence. The mutant DNA sequence encodes a substitution, insertion, and/or deletion of one or more amino acids in the amino acid sequence that would ordinarily be present in the naturally-occurring carbonyl hydrolase. Thus, the presence of the mutant DNA sequence, namely an amino acid sequence not found in nature, causes the carbonyl hydrolase that includes the DNA sequence to be a non-naturally-occurring, or recombinant, carbonyl hydrolase. The precursor carbonyl hydrolase of any particular recombinant carbonyl hydrolase may itself be either a naturally-occurring carbonyl hydrolase or a recombinant carbonyl hydrolase. Suitable methods for modifying the amino acid sequence to yield a recombinant carbonyl hydrolase are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,185,258; 5,204,015; 5,700,676; 5,763,257; 5,801,038; and 5,955,350 and in PCT Publication Nos. WO 95/10615 and WO 99/20771.",

In the chymotrypsins, the relative order of the catalytic triad of amino acids (aspartate, histidine, and serine), reading from the amino to carboxy terminus of the triad, is, however, histidine-aspartate-serine.

        "A series of naturally-occurring bacillus subtilisins is known to be produced and secreted by various microbial species, such as B. amyloliquefaciens, B. licheniformis, B. subtilis, and B. pumilus, for example.

Also, conditions for satisfactory activity levels vary somewhat between some members of this series. Furthermore, it is believed that some members of this series exhibit strong peptide hydrolase activity, whereas other members of this series exhibit little if any peptide hydrolase activity. The exemplary bacillus subtilisins provided above may be divided into two groups: (1) the subtilisins secreted by B. licheniformis (subtilisin Carlsberg) and B. pumilus, which are generally less stable below a pH of about 9.0 and (2) the subtilisins secreted by B. amyloliquefaciens (subtilisin Novo; subtilisin BPN) and by B. subtilis.

Positively hybridizing clones are then mapped and sequenced.",
        "The identified protease gene is then ligated into a high copy number plasmid. The high copy number plasmid with the ligated protease gene is then used to transform a host cell and express the protease of interest. This plasmid replicates in hosts in the sense that the plasmid contains the well-known elements necessary for plasmid replication: (1) a promoter operably linked to the gene of interest (which may be supplied as the gene's own homologous promoter if the promoter is recognized, i.e., transcribed by the host), (2) a transcription termination and polyadenylation region (necessary for stability of the mRNA transcribed by the host from the protease gene in certain eucaryotic host cells) that is exogenous or is supplied by the endogenous terminator region of the protease gene, and, desirably, (3) a selection gene, such as an antibiotic resistance gene, that enables continuous cultural maintenance of plasmid-infected host cells by growth in antibiotic-containing media. High copy number plasmids also contain an origin of replication for the host that thereby enables large numbers of plasmids to be generated in the cytoplasm without chromosomal limitations. However, it is within the scope of the present invention to integrate multiple copies of the protease gene into a host genome. This is facilitated by procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms that are particularly susceptible to homologous recombination.",
        "The following cassette mutagenesis method may also be used to facilitate construction of subtilisin variants (recombinant forms of subtilisin) that may be employed in the process of the present invention, although other methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art may also be used. First, the naturally-occurring gene encoding the subtilisin is obtained and sequenced in whole or in part. Then, the sequence is scanned for a point at which mutation (deletion, insertion, and/or substitution) of one or more amino acids in the encoded enzyme is desired. The amino acid sequences flanking this desired mutation point are evaluated for the presence of restriction sites that support replacement of a short segment of the gene with an oligonucleotide pool that, when expressed, will encode various mutants. Such restriction sites are preferably unique sites within the protease gene to facilitate replacement of the gene segment. However, any convenient restriction site that is not overly redundant in the protease gene may be used, provided the gene fragments generated by restriction digestion may be reassembled in proper sequence. If restriction sites are not present at locations within a convenient distance from the desired mutation point (from 10 to 15 nucleotides), suitable restriction sites are generated by substituting nucleotides in the gene without causing a change in either the reading frame or the amino acids that are encoded in the final construction.",
        "Mutation of the gene to change the sequence of the gene and conform to the desired sequence is accomplished by M13 primer extension in accordance with generally known methods. The task of locating suitable flanking regions and evaluating the needed changes to arrive at two convenient restriction site sequences is made routine by the redundancy of the genetic code, a restriction enzyme map of the gene, and the large number of different restriction enzymes. Note that if a convenient flanking restriction site is available, the above method need be used only in connection with the flanking region that does not contain a site.",

        "The present invention is more particularly described in the following examples which are intended as illustrations only since numerous modifications and variations within the scope of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art.",
        "This example demonstrates the effectiveness of the process of the present invention for substantially enhancing the Protein Dispersability Index (PDI) of soy flakes and for substantially decreasing the content of antigenic proteins, such as glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin, in soy flakes that are treated in accordance with the process of the present invention. In Example 1, 110 gallons (416.4 liters) {968 pounds (439.1 kilograms)} of warm water were added to a 240 gallon (908 liter) tank (subsequently referred to as a \u201cbatch reactor\u201d). The batch reactor was equipped with an agitator. The batch reactor was also equipped with a jacket for accommodating steam or hot water circulation to maintain or change the temperature of the contents of the batch reactor. With the water at a temperature of about 50\u00b0 C., 300 pounds (136.1 kilograms) of soy flakes were added to the warm water in the batch reactor under slow agitation to form a homogenous slurry of the soy flakes and water. The soy flakes were obtained from Harvest States Oilseed Processing & Refining of Mankato, Minn. After addition of the soy flakes was completed, hot water was circulated through the jacket of the batch reactor to raise the temperature of the slurry to about 53\u00b0 C.",
        "After formation of the slurry of soy flakes and water, the initial pH of the slurry was about 6.35 standard pH units. About 12 liters of a solution of 10 weight percent NaOH, based upon the total weight of the sodium hydroxide solution, was added to the slurry to adjust the pH of the slurry to about 9.00 standard pH units. The amount of sodium hydroxide solution that was added boosted the pH of the slurry higher than desired. Therefore, with the slurry still under agitation, about four liters of an aqueous acid solution containing about 10 weight percent hydrochloric acid, based upon the total weight of the aqueous acid solution, was gradually added to the agitated slurry until the pH of the slurry was reduced to about 8.48 standard pH units.",
        "About 3 pounds (1360 grams) {about 1500 milliliters} of MULTIFECT\u00ae P-3000 enzyme composition were then added to the slurry in the batch reactor while agitating the slurry. Thus, the MULTIFECT\u00ae P-3000 enzyme composition was added to the slurry at a ratio of about one pound (454 grams) of MULTIFECT\u00ae P-3000 enzyme composition per one hundred pounds (45.35 kilograms) of soy flakes. The MULTIFECT\u00ae P-3000 enzyme composition, which is a dark amber colored liquid, was obtained from Genencor International, Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif. The addition of the MULTIFECT\u00ae P-3000 enzyme composition initiated an enzymatic hydrolysis reaction that was allowed to continue in the batch reactor for a period of about two hours while maintaining the slurry at a temperature ranging from about 53\u00b0 C. to about 55\u00b0 C. and while maintaining mild agitation of the slurry.",
        "No caustic or acid was added to the slurry during the enzymatic hydrolysis, and the pH of the slurry was observed to drop to about 7.07 standard pH units after the two-hour period of enzymatic hydrolysis. At the end of the two hour enzymatic hydrolysis period, steam was passed through the jacket of the batch reactor and the slurry was heated to about 85\u00b0 C. to inactivate the alkaline proteolytic enzyme. Temperature and pH details during the two hour period of enzymatic hydrolysis and temperature details during the heating to inactivate the enzymes are provided below in Table 1:",

        "After enzyme inactivation was completed, the slurry was then pumped from the batch reactor to a pair of 120 gallon (454 liter) storage tanks equipped with agitators. Cold water was circulated through the jacket of the batch reactor during the transfer of the slurry to the storage tanks. Also, en route to the storage tanks, the slurry was passed through a COMITROL\u00ae Model No. 1700 processor to ensure that any fibrous material in the slurry was broken apart prior to drying. After transfer of the slurry through the COMITROL\u00ae processor and to the storage tanks was completed, 10 gallons (37.8 liters) of hot tap water was added to the slurry in one of the storage tanks and 15 gallons (56.8 liters) of hot tap water was added to the slurry in the other of the storage tank to facilitate subsequent spray drying. After hot water addition was completed, the diluted slurry in each of the storage tanks was introduced into a vertical spray dryer, supplied by C. E. Rogers Co. of Northville, Mich., to produce spray dried soy powder. The recovery rate for the processing described above in this example was about 90.7%, since 300 pounds (136.1 kilograms) of soy flakes were introduced into the batch reactor, and 272 pounds (123.4 kilograms) of spray dried soy powder were recovered from the spray dryer.",

        "The results shown in Table 2 demonstrate that, even though the soy flakes used as feed in this example contained little, if any, denatured protein, enzymatic hydrolysis in accordance with the present invention was nonetheless effective to increase the concentration of soluble protein by about 28 percent in the spray dried soy powder, as compared to the concentration of soluble protein in the soybean flakes used as feed. Also, the enzymatic hydrolysis procedure decreased the glycinin concentration by about 51.5 percent in the spray dried soy powder, as compared to the glycinin concentration in the soy flakes used as feed. Additionally, the enzymatic hydrolysis reduced the concentration of \u03b2-conglycinin by about 99.9 percent in the spray dried soy powder, as compared to the concentration of \u03b2-conglycinin in the soy flakes used as feed. Consequently, the enzymatic hydrolysis was effective to reduce the concentrations of the principal antigenic proteins (glycinin plus \u03b2-conglycinin) by about 70.5 percent in the spray dried soy powder, as compared to the concentrations of the principal antigenic proteins (glycinin plus \u03b2-conglycinin) in the soy flakes used as feed.",

Thus, in the graph of FIG. 2, as compared to the graph of FIG. 1, there was a shift to larger peak areas at higher retention time as compared to peak areas at similar retention times in the graph of FIG. 1. This demonstrates that the spray dried soy powder, as represented in the graph of FIG. 2, contained protein fragments with a smaller molecular weight average and profile as compared to the soy flakes depicted in the graph of FIG. 1. This correlates well with the substantially enhanced soluble protein concentration in the spray dried soy powder, as compared to the soluble protein concentration in the soy flakes.",

The glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin concentrations in the 20 PDI soy flour and in the spray dried soy flour were determined in accordance with the Glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin Determinations technique that is described above in the Property Determination & Characterization Techniques section.",
        "The results shown in Table 7 demonstrate that the enzymatic hydrolysis procedures that were carried out in Examples 2 and 3 were each effective to dramatically improve the PDI of the blended 20 PDI soy flour from a PDI of about 20 all the way up to a PDI on the order of about 80 for the spray dried soy flour, specifically, a PDI of 78.4 for Example 2 and a PDI of 81.5 for Example 3. Thus, the enzymatic hydrolysis of Example 2 improved the PDI in the spray dried soy flour by about 277 percent, as compared to the 20 PDI soy flour, whereas the enzymatic hydrolysis of Example 3 improved the PDI in the spray dried soy flour by about 292 percent, as compared to the 20 PDI soy flour. These dramatic increases in the PDI values for soy flours treated in accordance with the present invention graphically illustrate the ability of the present invention to improve solubilities of vegetable protein matter, such as those containing denatured soy proteins.",
        "Also, the enzymatic hydrolysis procedures of Examples 2 and 3 effected dramatic decreases in the concentration of one antigenic protein, glycinin. In Example 2, the glycinin concentration in the spray dried soy flour was about 89 percent less than the glycinin level in the 20 PDI soy flour, whereas in Example 3 the decrease in glycinin concentration for the spray dried soy flour was a more modest 70 percent, as compared to the glycinin concentration in the 20 PDI soy flour. The inventive enzymatic hydrolysis process was even more dramatic in its effectiveness at treating another antigenic protein, namely \u03b2-conglycinin. More specifically, in Examples 2 and 3, the enzymatic hydrolysis procedure was able to completely eliminate any \u03b2-conglycinin content in the spray dried soy flour produced in Examples 2 and 3, even though the 20 PDI soy flour used as feed in these examples had a \u03b2-conglycinin concentration of 32 milligrams per gram of crude protein. Consequently, in Example 2, the enzymatic hydrolysis was effective to reduce the overall concentration of the principal antigenic proteins (glycinin plus \u03b2-conglycinin) by nearly 90 percent in the spray dried soy powder, as compared to the concentration of the principal antigenic proteins in the 20 PDI soy flour. Likewise, the enzymatic hydrolysis was effective to reduce the concentration of the principal antigenic proteins (glycinin plus \u03b2-conglycinin) by about 80 percent in the spray dried soy flour of Example 3, as compared to the concentration of the principal antigenic proteins in the 20 PDI soy flour.",
        "Samples of a blend of the 20 PDI soy flour used in Examples 2 and 3 as the feed material and samples of a blend of the spray dried soy flour produced in Examples 2 and 3 were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to detect any shift in the spray dried soy flour toward protein fragments with smaller molecular weights versus the 20 PDI soy flour. The high pressure liquid chromatography analysis was conducted in accordance with the procedure set forth above in the Property Determination & Characterization Techniques section. The HPLC results for the blend of 20 PDI soy flour used as feed in Examples 2 and 3 are provided in the graph of FIG. 4, and the HPLC results for blend of spray dried soy flour from Examples 2 and 3 are provided in the graph of FIG. 5.",
        "The graphs of FIGS. 4 and 5 may be readily interpreted when it is recognized that protein fragments with larger molecular weights show up earlier during the HPLC scan in peaks with shorter retention times and protein fragments with smaller molecular weights show up later during the HPLC scan in peaks with longer retention times. Thus, in the graph of FIG. 5, as compared to the graph of FIG. 4, there was a shift to larger peak areas at higher retention times as compared to peak areas at similar retention times in the graph of FIG. 4. This demonstrates that the blend of spray dried soy flours produced in Examples 2 and 3, as represented in the graph of FIG. 5, contained protein fragments with a smaller molecular weight average and profile, as compared to the sample of blended 20 PDI soy flour feed material from Examples 2 and 3, as depicted in the graph of FIG. 4. This correlates well with the substantially enhanced soluble protein concentration (increased PDI) in the spray dried soy flour samples of Examples 2 and 3, as compared to the soluble protein concentration in the 20 PDI soy flours used as feed in Examples 2 and 3.",
        "The graphs of FIGS. 4 and 5, when subject to a regression analysis, further demonstrate the beneficial protein molecular weight reduction achieved by the process of the present invention. Specifically, this regression analysis revealed that the sample of blended 20 PDI soy flour feed material from Examples 2 and 3, as depicted in the graph of FIG. 4, includes mostly protein fragments with a molecular weight size ranging from about 123 kilodaltons to about 394 kilodaltons. On the other hand, regression analysis revealed that the blend of spray dried soy flours produced in Examples 2 and 3, as represented in the graph of FIG. 5, includes mostly protein fragments with a molecular weight size below about 2400 Daltons, with the actual range extending from about 200 Daltons to about 2400 Daltons for the vast majority of the protein fragments.",
        "Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."
