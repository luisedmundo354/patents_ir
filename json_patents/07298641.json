        "The present invention relates to reconfigurable semiconductor storage devices.",
        "Traditionally, integrated circuit (IC) devices such as custom, semi-custom, or application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) devices have been used in electronic products to reduce cost, enhance performance or meet space constraints. However, the design and fabrication of custom or semi-custom ICs can be time consuming and expensive. The customization involves a lengthy design cycle during the product definition phase and high Non Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs during manufacturing phase. In the event of finding a logic error in the custom or semi-custom IC during final test phase, the design and fabrication cycle has to be repeated. Such lengthy correction cycles further aggravate the time to market and engineering cost. As a result, ASICs serve only specific applications and are custom built for high volume and low cost applications.",
        "Another type of semi custom device called a Gate Array customizes modular blocks at a reduced NRE cost by synthesizing the design using a software model similar to the ASIC. The missing silicon level design verification results in multiple spins and lengthy design iterations.",
        "In recent years there has been a move away from custom or semi-custom ICs towards field programmable components whose function is determined not when the integrated circuit is fabricated, but by an end user \u201cin the field\u201d prior to use. Off the shelf, generic Programmable Logic Device (PLD) or Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) products greatly simplify the design cycle. These products offer user-friendly software to fit custom logic into the device through programmability, and the capability to tweak and optimize designs to optimize silicon performance. The flexibility of this programmability is expensive in terms of silicon real estate, but reduces design cycle and upfront NRE cost to the designer.",
        "FPGAs offer the advantages of low non-recurring engineering costs, fast turnaround (designs can be placed and routed on an FPGA in typically a few minutes), and low risk since designs can be easily amended late in the product design cycle. It is only for high volume production runs that there is a cost benefit in using the more traditional approaches. Compared to PLD and FPGA, an ASIC has hard-wired logic connections, identified during the chip design phase. ASIC has no multiple logic choices and no configuration memory to customize logic. This is a large chip area and cost saving for the ASIC. Smaller ASIC die sizes lead to better performance. A full custom ASIC also has customized logic functions which take less gate counts compared to PLD and FPGA configurations of the same functions. Thus, an ASIC is significantly smaller, faster, cheaper and more reliable than an equivalent gate-count PLD or FPGA. The trade-off is between time-to-market (PLD and FPGA advantage) versus low cost and better reliability (ASIC advantage). The cost of Silicon real estate for programmability provided by the PLD and FPGA compared to ASIC determines the extra cost the user has to bear for customer re-configurability of logic functions.",
        "Multi-input and multi-output digital logic systems are classified into combinational and sequential logic. Combinational logic has no memory and the outputs reflect a function solely of present inputs. Sequential logic is implemented by inserting memory into the logic path. This allows present input states as well as past input and past output states to determine the present output. In sequential logic the logic output and logic inputs can be stored and re-used as inputs at a later time point. Many such logic systems include clocks, preset and clear signals and are classified into synchronous and asynchronous systems. A storage element is used to store information about the previous condition of the sequential logic system. The most common bistable circuit in use is a multivibrator, or commonly called flip-flop. In a sequential circuit, these flip-flops can be by passed to facilitate combinational logic. Flip-flops contain two inverting gates cross-coupled in a positive feed back to assume one of two stable output states. There are many types of flip-flops available for use: SR, JK, Clocked JK, T, D with and without Preset and Clear options. They provide a pair of complementary outputs and contain one or more inputs that can cause the output state to change. FIG. 1 shows a schematic diagram of three basic flip-plops: SR in FIG. 1A, JK in FIG. 1B and D in FIG. 1C. The complementary outputs are customarily labeled Q and Q\u2032 (not Q). The inputs are labeled S, R, J, K or D in each of the respective flip-flops. The user application determines the best option for the flip-flop in the logic design.",
        "A flip-flop has a present state and a next state. The present state means the state of Q output in FIG. 1 at the time input signals are applied or changed. The next state means the state of Q output after the flip-flop has reacted to the inputs signals. The transient time taken for the flip-flop to stabilize is carefully avoided in the logic design. Each flip-flop has a well defined sequence for its output behavior in response to input signals. This next state sequence differs from one flip-flop to another and can be characterized by a Characteristic Equation, State Graph, Truth Table, and Karnaugh Map. Examples of characteristic equations and truth tables for some of the flip-flops in FIG. 1 are shown in FIG. 2. As shown in FIG. 2, the undesired states in SR flip-flop are removed in the JK flip-flop, while the D flip-flop has only a single input and an output reflecting that input.",
        "A master-slave flip-flop is a structure where input and output terminals are kept disjoint. A common arrangement is to cascade two flip-flops and clock data in complementary signals. The master flip-flop captures data from inputs on one phase of the clock, while the slave flip-flop captures data from the master flip-flop in the opposite phase of the clock.",
        "Existing PLD and FPGA architectures utilizing flip-flops are discussed in Hartmann U.S. Pat. No. 4,609,986, Carter U.S. Pat. No. 4,706,216, Turner et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,761,768, Norman et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,864,161, Freemann U.S. Pat. No. 4,870,302, ElGamal et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,459, Freemann et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,488,316 & 5,343,406, Trimberger et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,844,422, Cliff et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,134,173, Couts-Martin et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,097,211, Mendel U.S. Pat. No. 6,275,065 and Young et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,448,808. These have flip-flops embedded in basic the logic elements of an FPGA fabric or the macro-cells of a PLD fabric. FPGA's and PLD's are constructed with a repetitive pattern consisting of these basic building blocks. A routing block is programmed to define inputs and outputs to the logic blocks, while the logic block performs a specific logic function. Such a logic block described in Ref-1 is shown in FIG. 3, which has a built in fixed D-flip-flop. In FIG. 3, elements 301, 302 and 303 are 2:1 MUX's controlled by one input signal. Element 304 is an OR gate while 305 is a D-Flip-Flop. Eight inputs feed the logic block. All two-input, most 3-input and some 4-input variable functions are realized in the logic block and latched to the D-Flip-Flop. The Flip-Flop in itself offers no configurable capability. Most FPGA's and PLD's referenced earlier have a similar built-in D Flip-Flop inside the logic block. An AND, NOR gate realization of a clocked D-Flip-Flop with Preset and Clear functions is shown in FIG. 4. In FIG. 4, element 401 is an inverter, 402 and 403 are 2-input AND gates and 404 and 405 are 3-input NOR gates. This can be customized by the user only with the logic content available in that and neighboring logic elements. Overall logic capacity is thus reduced from configuring flip-flops outside of what is provided by the manufacturer and the available logic density for the application is drastically reduced.",
        "Kaplinsky U.S. Pat. No. 5,164,612, Orgill et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,684,744, Kelem U.S. Pat. No. 6,061,417 and Fifield et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,420,925 have discussed programmability with respect to latches, registers and flip-flops. These implementations are either very high in Silicon area, or provide little flexibility for user change. A useful measure of a programmable circuit is the gate comparison to an equivalent specific application circuit. In most programmable devices, after the user has finalized the logic design, it is rarely or never changed. For these designs, a conversion from programmable to application specific is highly desirable. The referenced usages do not lend to an easy economical conversion. An inexpensive, single configurable storage device that will allow the user the flexibility in picking the most desired flip-flop type from a variety of choices is highly desirable for programmable logic applications.

        "A point to point connection can be made utilizing pass-gate logic. FIG. 5 shows exemplary programmable pass-gate logic realization. A transistor 510 connects one input I1 to one output O1. Multiple inputs can be connected to multiple outputs with a plurality of pass-gate logic elements. The transistor 510 can be a PMOS or an NOMS transistor, but NMOS is preferred due to its higher conduction. The gate voltage S0 on NMOS transistor 510 gate electrode determines an ON or OFF connection. That logic level is generated by a configuration circuit 520 coupled to the gate of NMOS transistor 510. The pass-gate logic connection requires the configuration circuitry to generate signal S0 with sufficient voltage levels to ensure off and on conditions. For an NMOS pass-gate, S0 having a logic level one completes the point to point connection, while a logic level zero keeps them disconnected. In addition to using only an NMOS gate, a PMOS gate could also be used in parallel to make the connection. The configuration circuit 520 needs to then provide complementary outputs (S0 and S0\u2032) to drive NMOS and PMOS gates making the connection. Configuration circuit 520 contains a memory element. This memory element can be configured by the user to select the polarity of S0, thereby selecting the status of the connection. The memory element can be volatile or non-volatile.

An inverter can be used to restore S0 signal level to achieve full rail to rail voltage levels.",
        "The memory element in the configuration circuit can be one of any number of possibilities. A few of these possibilities will be discussed next to illustrate the concept of this invention. A volatile six transistor SRAM based configuration circuit is shown in FIG. 6A. The SRAM memory bit can be any one of 6-transistor, full CMOS, R-load or TFT PMOS load to name a few. Two inverters 601 and 602 connected back to back forms the memory element. This memory element is latch. Power and ground terminals for the inverters are not shown in FIG. 6A. Access NMOS transistors 603 and 604, and access wires GA, GB, BL and BS provide the means to configure the memory element. Applying zero and one on BL and BS respectively, and raising GA and GB high enables writing zero into device 603 and one into device 604. The output S0 delivers a logic one. Applying one and zero on BL and BS respectively, and raising GA and GB high enables writing one into device 603 and zero into device 604. The output S0 delivers a logic zero. The SRAM construction may allow applying only a zero signal at BL or BS to write data into the latch. The SRAM latch will hold the data state as long as power is on. When the power is turned off, the SRAM bit needs to be restored to the previous state from an outside permanent memory. In the literature for programmable logic, this second non-volatile memory is also called configuration memory. The SRAM configuration circuit controlling logic pass-gate is illustrated in FIG. 6B. The S0 output directly driven by the memory element in FIG. 6A drives the pass-gate gate electrode. In addition to S0 output and the latch, power, ground, data in and write enable signals in 620 constitutes the SRAM configuration circuit. Write enable circuitry includes GA, GB, BL, BS signals shown in FIG. 6A.",
        "An anti-fuse based configuration circuit is shown next in FIG. 7. Configuration circuit 620 in FIG. 6B can be replaced with the anti-fuse circuit shown in FIG. 7. In FIG. 7, output level S0 is generated from node X which is coupled to signals VA and VB via two anti-fuses 750 and 760 respectively. Node X is connected to a programming access transistor 770 controlled by gate signal GA and drain signal BL. A very high programming voltage is needed to blow the anti-fuse capacitor. This programming voltage level is determined by the anti-fuse properties, including the dielectric thickness. Asserting signal VA very high, VB low (typically ground), BL low and GA high (Vcc to pass the ground signal) provides a current path from VA to BL through the on transistor 770. A high voltage is applied across anti-fuse 750 to pop the oxide and short the terminals. Similarly anti-fuse 760 can be programmed by selecting VA low, VB very high, BL low and GA high. Only one of the two anti-fuses is blown to form a short. When the programming is done, BL and GA are returned to zero, isolating node X from the programming path. VA=Vss (ground) and VB=Vcc (power) is applied to the two signal lines. Depending on the blown fuse, signal S0 will generate a logic low or a logic high signal. This is a one time programmable memory device. Node X will be always connected to VA or VB by the blown fuse regardless of the device power status. Signals GA and BL are constructed orthogonally to facilitate row and column based decoding to construct these memory elements in an array.",
        "FIG. 8 shows an EEPROM non-volatile configuration circuit. Configuration circuit 620 in FIG. 6B can be replaced with the EEPROM circuit shown in FIG. 8. In FIG. 8, node 840 is a floating gate. This is usually a poly-silicon film isolated by an oxide all around. It is coupled to the source end of programming transistor 820 via a tunneling diode 830. The tunneling diode is a thin dielectric capacitor between floating poly and substrate silicon with high doping on either side. When a large programming (or erase) voltage Vpp is applied across the thin dielectric, a Fowler-Nordheim current flows through the oxide. The tunneling electrons move from electrical negative to electrical positive voltage. Choosing the polarity of the applied voltage across the tunneling dielectric, the direction of electron flow can be reversed. Multiple programming and erase cycles are possible for these memory elements. As the tunneling currents are small, the high programming voltage (Vpp) can be generated on chip, and the programming and erase can be done while the chip is in a system. It is hence called in system programmable. An oxide or dielectric capacitor 810 couples the floating gate (FG) to a control gate (CG). The control gate CG can be a heavily doped silicon substrate plate or a second poly-silicon plate above the floating poly. The dielectric can be oxide, nitride, ONO or any other insulating material. A voltage applied to CG will be capacitively coupled to FG node 840. The coupling ratio is designed such that 60-80 percent of CG voltage will be coupled to FG node 840. To program this memory element, a negative charge must be trapped on the FG 840. This is done by applying Vpp voltage on CG, ground voltage on PL and a sufficient high (Vcc) on RL. CG couples a high positive voltage onto FG 840 creating a high voltage drop across diode 830. Electrons move to the FG 840 to reduce this field. When the memory device is returned to normal voltages, a net negative voltage remains trapped on the FG 840. To erase the memory element, the electrons must be removed from the floating gate. This can be done by UV light, but an electrical method is more easily adapted. The CG is grounded, a vey high voltage (Vpp+more to prevent a threshold voltage drop across 820) is applied to RL, and a very high voltage (Vpp) is applied to PL. Now a low voltage is coupled to FG with a very high positive voltage on the source side of device 820. Diode 830 tunneling removes electrons of FG. This removal continues beyond a charge neutral state for the isolated FG. When the memory device is returned to normal voltages, a net positive voltage remains trapped on the FG 840. Under normal operation RL is grounded to isolate the memory element from the programming path, and PL is grounded. A positive intermediate voltage Vcg is applied to CG terminal. FG voltage is denoted S0. Under CG bias, S0 signal levels are designed to activate pass-gate logic correctly. The circuit block in FIG. 8 can be utilized in configuration circuit 620 in FIG. 6B, and in place of configuration block 520 in FIG. 5 to perform the same function.",
        "These configuration circuits can be used to realize many programmable logic functions. FIG. 9 shows an EEPROM non-volatile memory element in the implementation of a P-Term in NAND-NOR logic. FIG. 9 shows two mirrored outputs P1 and P2. For output P1, an AND gate 932 comprised of a pull-up device receives signals from pass transistors 922, 924, 928 and 930 for the pull-down function.

This voltage output level applied to the gate of device 922 is designed to turn the device off or on.",
        "Another logic function realized by these configuration circuits is a programmable MUX. FIG. 10A shows a programmable 2:1 MUX, while FIG. 10B shows two 2:1 programmable MUX's. In the MUX in FIG. 10A, two pass-gates 1001 and 1002 allow two inputs I1 and I2 to be connected to output O. A configuration circuit 1020 having two complementary control signal outputs S0 and S0\u2032 provides the programmability. When S0=1, S0\u2032=0, I1 is coupled to O. When S0=0, S0\u2032=1, I2 is coupled to O. With one memory element inside 1020, one input is always coupled to the output. If two bits were provided inside 1020, two mutually exclusive outputs S0 and S1 could be generated by 1020. That would allow neither I1 nor I2 to be coupled to O, if such a requirement exists in the logic design. The two MUX's in FIG. 10B operate with a single memory element in configuration circuit 1040. Similar to FIG. 10A, one of I0 and I1 is connected to O1 while one of I2 and I3 is connected to O2. In one memory state I0 and I2 are selected, while in the opposite state I1 and I3 are selected. Both configuration circuits 1020 and 1040 can be any one of circuits shown in FIG. 6A, FIG. 7 or FIG. 8.

        "SRAM memory technology has the advantage of not requiring a high voltage to configure memory. The SRAM based switch shown in FIG. 6B containing the SRAM memory circuit shown in FIG. 6A utilizes 6 extra configuration transistors, discounting the pass-gate 610, to provide the programmability. That is a significant overhead compared to application specific circuits where the point to point connection can be directly made with metal. Similarly other programmable memory elements capable of configuring pass-gate logic also carry a high silicon foot print. A cheaper method of constructing a vertically integrated SRAM cell is described in application Ser. No. 10/413,810 entitled \u201cSemiconductor Latches and SRAM Devices\u201d, filed on Apr. 14, 2003 and list as inventor Mr. R. U. Madurawe, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, the configuration circuit is built on thin-film semiconductor layers located vertically above the logic circuits. The SRAM memory element, a thin-film transistor (TFT) CMOS latch, comprises two lower performance back to back inverters formed on two semiconductor thin film layers, substantially different from a first semiconductor single crystal substrate layer and a gate poly layer used for logic transistor construction. This latch is stacked above the logic circuits for slow memory applications with no penalty on Silicon area and cost. This latch is adapted to receive power and ground voltages in addition to configuration signals. The two programming access transistors for the TFT latch are also formed on thin-film layers. Thus in FIG. 6B, all six configuration transistors shown in 620 are constructed in TFT layers, vertically above the pass transistor 610. Transistor 610 is in the conducting path of the connection and needs to be a high performance single crystal Silicon transistor. This vertical integration makes it economically feasible to add an SRAM based configuration circuit at a very small cost overhead to create a programmable solution. Such vertical integration can be extended to all other memory elements that can be vertically integrated above logic circuits.",
        "A new kind of a programmable logic device utilizing thin-film transistor configurable circuits is disclosed in application Ser. No. 10/267,484 entitled \u201cMethods for Fabricating Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits\u201d, application Ser. No. 10/267,483 entitled \u201cThree Dimensional Integrated Circuits\u201d, and application Ser. No. 10/267,511 entitled \u201cField Programmable Gate Array With Convertibility to Application Specific Integrated Circuit\u201d, all of which were filed on Oct. 8, 2002 and list as inventor Mr. R. U. Madurawe, the contents of which are incorporated-by-reference. The disclosures describe a programmable logic device and an application specific device fabrication from the same base Silicon die. The PLD is fabricated with a programmable memory module, while the ASIC is fabricated with a conductive pattern in lieu of the memory. Both memory module and conductive pattern provide identical control of logic circuits. For each set of memory bit patterns, there is a unique conductive pattern to achieve the same logic functionality. The vertical integration of the configuration circuit leads to a significant cost reduction for the PLD, and the elimination of TFT memory for the ASIC allows an additional cost reduction for the user. FIG. 11 shows an implementation of vertically integrated circuits, where the configuration memory element is SRAM. First, silicon transistors 1150 are deposited on a substrate. A module layer of removable SRAM memory cells 1152 are positioned above the silicon transistors 1150, and a module layer of interconnect wiring or routing circuit 1154 is formed above the removable memory cells 1152. To allow this replacement, the design adheres to a hierarchical layout structure. As shown in FIG. 11, the SRAM cell module is sandwiched between the single crystal device layers below and the metal layers above electrically connecting to both. It also provides through connections \u201cA\u201d for the lower device layers to upper metal layers. The SRAM module contains no switching electrical signal routing inside the module. All such routing is in the layers above and below. Most of the programmable element configuration signals run inside the module. Upper layer connections to SRAM module \u201cC\u201d are minimized to Power, Ground and high drive data wires. Connections \u201cB\u201d between SRAM module and single crystal module only contain logic level signals and replaced later by Vcc and Vss wires. Most of the replaceable programmable elements and its configuration wiring is in the \u201creplaceable module\u201d while all the devices and wiring for the end ASIC is outside the \u201creplaceable module\u201d. In other embodiments, the replaceable module could exist between two metal layers or as the top most layer satisfying the same device and routing constraints. This description is equally applicable to any other configuration memory element, and not limited to SRAM cells.",
        "Fabrication of the IC also follows a modularized device formation. Formation of transistors 1150 and routing 1154 is by utilizing a standard logic process flow used in the ASIC fabrication. Extra processing steps used for memory element 1152 formation are inserted into the logic flow after circuit layer 1150 is constructed. A full disclosure of the vertical integration of the TFT module using extra masks and extra processing is in the incorporated by reference applications discussed above.",
        "During the customization, the base die and the data in those remaining mask layers do not change making the logistics associated with chip manufacture simple. Removal of the SRAM module provides a low cost standard logic process for the final ASIC construction with the added benefit of a smaller die size. The design timing is unaffected by this migration as lateral metal routing and silicon transistors are untouched. Software verification and the original FPGA design methodology provide a guaranteed final ASIC solution to the user. A full disclosure of the ASIC migration from the original FPGA is in the incorporated by reference applications discussed above.",
        "The ASIC migration of the point to point connection in FIG. 6B and the 2:1 MUX in FIG. 10A are illustrated in FIG. 12A and FIG. 12B respectively. In FIG. 12A, the gate input signal to pass-gate 1210 has two possible conductive pattern connections: connection 1230 to Vss and connection 1240 to Vcc. The connections are made in metal or contacts between metal in the data base. Based on the S0 output state being 0 or 1 of a memory pattern to map into a conductive pattern, either Vss or the Vcc connection is chosen. For each memory bit state, only one conductive pattern connection is made. Similarly in FIG. 12B, pass-gate 1201 has conductive pattern options to Vss and Vcc at nodes 1231 and 1241 respectively. Pass-gate 1202 has conductive pattern options to Vss and Vcc at nodes 1232 and 1242 respectively. One of I0 or I1 can be connected to O from this option. Comparing FIG. 6A with FIG. 12A and FIG. 10A with FIG. 12A, the point to point connection is identical between the two configuration options: memory element and conductive pattern. The signal delay through these pass-gate connections also remains identical, independent of the control option.",
        "In a second embodiment for the conductive pattern, the pass-gate 1210 drain is shorted to source in FIG. 12A by a metal wire when S0=1. Wire resistance is reduced by eliminating pass-gate 1210 ON resistance from the signal path. When S0=0, the pass-gate is left connected to Vss. The signal delay will be altered between the conducting pattern and memory options. That change can be emulated in the FPGA by raising only memory Vcc, raising S0 voltage to reduce 1210 ON resistance. This may be desirable to users who need higher performance in the ASIC and ensure no other timing violations.",
        "In FIG. 11, the third module layer is formed substantially above the first and second module layers, wherein interconnect and routing signals are formed to connect the circuit blocks within the first and second module layers. Alternatively, the third module layer can be formed substantially below the first and second module layer with interconnect and routing signals formed to connect the circuit blocks within the first and second module layers. Alternatively, the third and fourth module layers positioned above and below the second module layer respectively, wherein the third and fourth module layers provide interconnect and routing signals to connect the circuit blocks within the first and second module layers.",

        "As the discussions demonstrate, memory controlled pass transistor logic elements provide a powerful tool to make switches.

In FIG. 13, the configuration circuit can be any one of the previously shown options as in FIG. 6A, FIG. 7 and FIG. 8. Any other memory element adapted to providing the functionality described under those sections can also be used in this flip-flop design. The control signal levels (denoted S0 for the circuit in FIG. 6A) from said five bits in FIG. 13 are also denoted S0, S1, S2, S3 and S4 in this discussion. Table-1 describes the programmable means of altering the flip-flop type by configuring the memory bits. The bubbles in FIG. 9 represent any number of possible configuration circuits. Such possible options include circuits discussed in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8. A preferred option is the 6T-SRAM cell based configuration circuit as shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B. Elements 1301, 1302, 1303 and 1304 are 2:1 MUXs as shown in FIG. 10A. These MUXs are grouped in pairs 1301, 1302 and pair 1303, 1304 and constructed as shown in FIG. 10B to function with only one memory element for both MUX's. As marked in FIG. 13, one input in the 2:1 MUX is at logic 1 or at voltage Vcc. Element 1308 is a CMOS inverter capable of inverting the J-input shown. Elements 1309 and 1310 are 3-input AND gates. Elements 1311 and 1312 are 3-input NOR gates. They are all assumed to be full-CMOS for this discussion. The two NOR gates are cross-coupled to provided a positive feed-back. Elements 1305, 1306 and 1307 are NMOS pass-gate logic transistors. There are 6 more NMOS pass-gate logic transistors embedded in the four 2:1 MUXs 1301, 1302, 1303 and 1304. Storage device has two complementary outputs Q and Q\u2032. The feed-back in the NOR gates ensure data stability. The inputs have multiple options and are labeled J (=S), K (=R), D, T, CLK, Preset and Clear. Preset and Clear signals are active low. They need to be asserted to logic zero to activate logic. One of Preset=0 or Clear=0 signals sets flip-flop Q=1 or Q=0 respectively for all flip-flop types. The clock (CLK) is active high. Configuration circuit outputs S0, S1, S2, S3 and S4 at logic \u201c1\u201d or logic \u201c0\u201d govern the conditions of the pass-gates. The NMOS pass gate is \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d when the logic output is \u201c1\u201d or \u201c0\u201d respectively. There are 11 NMOS pass-gat controlled by 5 memory elements in the configuration circuit to configure this generic flip-flop.",
        "In FIG. 13, the S0 bit controls the T input, or Clock input signal. When S0=1, the T input goes through to AND gates 1309 and 1310 to enable clocking. When S0=0 the T or Clock input is disabled. This input is selected by the user for a T flip flop or as the Clock input for clocked flip flops. Row-3 in Tab-1 shows other bit configuration to activate a T flip-flop. J and K inputs to AND gates are disabled by setting S2=0 and selecting logic 1. The inverter is disabled by S4 bit. Q and Q\u2032 feedbacks are provided to AND gates 1309 and 1310 respectively with S3 bit. When the T-input is low, AND gates 1309 and 1310 are forced to output logic-0, which provide don't care input states for the NOR gates. Clear and Preset also inputs logic-0 to the NOR gates when not asserted. When T-input goes high, Q will flip from its original state creating a toggle response to the T-input.",
        "In FIG. 13, the S1 bit allows K input to get to input AND gate 1309. When S1=1 the K input is selected to AND gate 1309. When S1=0 the K input is disconnected. The S2 bit selects either J and K inputs or logic-1 inputs. When S2=1, the input MUX's 1301 and 1302 select J and K as inputs, while when S1=0, the input MUX's 1301 and 1302 select logic-1 as the inputs. Similarly S3 bit controls the Q and Q\u2032 (not Q) feed-backs in MUX's 1304 and 1303 respectively. The feed-back is disabled by setting S3=0. The MUX 1303 and 1304 outputs feed into to AND gates 1310 and 1309 respectively. S3=0 selects logic-1 that act as don't care inputs to AND gates. S3=1 allows the Q and Q\u2032 feed backs to AND gate inputs. The bit S4 allows conversion to D flip-flop. When S4=1, J (now equal to D) is fed to AND gate 1310, while K-input is disabled by S1, and inverted J input is fed to AND gate 1309.",
        "As shown in Tab-1, all flip-flop types can be realized by configuring the 5 memory bits. The user does not have to use extra logic from adjacent logic blocks to configure the flip-flop, allowing a wide degree of user flexibility in logic design. The D-flip flop shown in FIG. 4 has 22 transistors. Discounting SRAM configuration circuit transistors, the multi-purpose flip-flop in FIG. 13 has 37 transistors. All 37 transistors belong to the storage circuit. Additional 15 transistors are 2 extra PMOS transistors (in 3-input AND gates), and 13 extra NMOS transistors (8 in the 2:1 MUX's, 3 in NMOS pass-gates and 2 in the 3-input AND gates). The layout area can be kept under 1.5\u00d7 of the area of D-flip flop in FIG. 4 due to compact NMOS layout rules in spite of 1.7\u00d7 increase in transistor count. In addition to the 37 gates, FIG. 13 also has 5 extra 6T-SRAM elements taking up 30 extra transistors for configuration circuit. This programmable multi-purpose flip-flop would have taken 67 extra transistors on a non stackable SRAM process technology, making the 3\u00d7 Si cost prohibitive for any practical application. Under the new techniques disclosed in this invention, those 30 extra configuration transistors in a 3D integration occupy the same area as the 37 storage transistors of the multi-purpose flip-flop, causing no additional area and cost penalty.",
        "NMOS pass-gate logic realization has two disadvantages. Passing Vcc (logic 1) is degraded due to threshold voltage drop across the NMOS. As a result, the input AND gates do not receive full Vcc signal level which may cause slightly higher power consumption. This can be overcome with CMOS pass-gates or by running the TFT SRAM Vcc level in FIG. 6B higher than the logic Vcc level by an amount equal to the body-effect adjusted threshold voltage of logic NMOS transistor. This allows logic NMOS gate in FIG. 13 to pass full Vcc, improving both performance and power consumption.",
        "FIG. 14 illustrates a second embodiment of a multi purpose generic flip-flop. In FIG. 14, elements 1409, 1410, 1411 and 1412 are all 3-input NAND gates. Preset and Clear are active low asynchronous signals to set and reset the flip-flop independent of the clock signal. Clock (T or CLK) is an active high signal. All popular flip-flops can be derived from this generic flip-flop by programming the bit-pattern as shown in Table-1. The configuration circuits and memory elements to realize this flip-flop can be any one of the possible circuits described in the body of this discussion.",
        "Both flip-flops shown in FIG. 13 and FIG. 14 has a unique bit pattern for the chosen flip-flop type. That bit pattern identifies output levels S0, S1, S2, S3 and S4 needed for configuration. Those levels can be mapped to a conductive pattern as shown in FIGS. 12A and 12B. Once the user identifies the flip-flop of choice in the programmable logic application, the same flip-flop can be mapped to the application specific application using this conductive pattern.",

In other embodiments the insertion point may be after M1 and the ILD is deposition, prior to V1 mask, or between two metal definition steps.",
        "After gate poly of regular transistors are patterned and etched, the poly is salicided using Nickel & RTA sequences. Then the ILD is deposited, and polished by CMP techniques to a desired thickness. In the shown embodiment, the contact mask is split into two levels. The first C1 mask contains all contacts that connect latch outputs to substrate transistor gates and active nodes. Then the C1 mask is used to open and etch contacts in the ILD film. Ti/TiN glue layer followed by W-Six plugs, W plugs or Si plugs may be used to fill the plugs, then CMP polished to leave the fill material only in the contact holes. The choice of fill material is based on the thermal requirements of the TFT module.",
        "Then, a first P1 poly layer, amorphous or crystalline, is deposited by LPCVD to a desired thickness as shown in FIG. 15.1. The P1 thickness is between 50 A and 1000 A, and preferably 250 A. This poly layer P1 is used for the channel, source, and drain regions for both NMOS and PMOS TFT's. It is patterned and etched to form the transistor body regions. In other embodiments, P1 is used for contact pedestals. NMOS transistors are blanket implanted with P\u2212 doping, while the PMOS transistor regions are mask selected and implanted with N\u2212 doping. This is shown in FIG. 15.2. The implant doses and P1 thickness are optimized to get the required threshold voltages for PMOS & NMOS devices under fully depleted transistor operation, and maximize on/off device current ratio. The pedestals implant type is irrelevant at this point. In another embodiment, the VT implantation is done with a mask P\u2212 implant followed by masked N\u2212 implant. First doping can also be done in-situ during poly deposition or by blanket implant after poly is deposited.",
        "Patterned and implanted P1 may be subjected to dopant activation and crystallization. In one embodiment, RTA cycle is used to activate & crystallize the poly after it is patterned to near single crystal form. In a second embodiment, the gate dielectric is deposited, and buried contact mask is used to etch areas where P1 contacts P2 layer. Then, Ni is deposited and salicided with RTA cycle. All of the P1 in contact with Ni is salicided, while the rest poly is crystallized to near single crystal form. Then the unreacted Ni is etched away. In a third embodiment, amorphous poly is crystallized prior to P1 patterning with an oxide cap, metal seed mask, Ni deposition and MILC (Metal-Induced-Lateral-Crystallization).",
        "Then the TFT gate dielectric layer is deposited followed by P2 layer deposition. The dielectric is deposited by PECVD techniques to a desired thickness in the 30-200 A range, desirably 70 A thick. The gate may be grown thermally by using RTA. This gate material could be an oxide, nitride, oxynitride, ONO structure, or any other dielectric material combination used as gate dielectric. The dielectric thickness is determined by the voltage level of the process. At this point an optional buried contact mask (BC) may be used to open selected P1 contact regions, etch the dielectric and expose P1 layer. BC could be used on P1 pedestals to form P1/P2 stacks over C1. In the P1 salicided embodiment using Ni, the dielectric deposition and buried contact etch occur before the crystallization. In the preferred embodiment, no BC is used.",
        "Then second poly P2 layer, 300 A to 2000 A thick, preferably 500 A is deposited as amorphous or crystalline poly-silicon by LPCVD as shown in FIG. 15.3. P2 layer is defined into NMOS & PMOS gate regions intersecting the P1 layer body regions, C1 pedestals if needed, and local interconnect lines and then etched. The P2 layer etching is continued until the dielectric oxide is exposed over P1 areas uncovered by P2 (source, drain, P1 resistors). The source & drain P1 regions orthogonal to P2 gate regions are now self aligned to P2 gate edges. The S/D P2 regions may contact P1 via buried contacts. NMOS devices are blanket implanted with LDN N\u2212 dopant. Then PMOS devices are mask selected and implanted with LDP P\u2212 dopant as shown in FIG. 15.4. The implant energy ensures full dopant penetration through the residual oxide into the S/D regions adjacent to P2 layers.",
        "A spacer oxide is deposited over the LDD implanted P2 using LTO or PECVD techniques. The oxide is etched to form spacers. The spacer etch leaves a residual oxide over P1 in a first embodiment, and completely removes oxide over exposed P1 in a second embodiment. The latter allows for P1 salicidation at a subsequent step. Then NMOS devices & N+ poly interconnects are blanket implanted with N+. The implant energy ensures full or partial dopant penetration into the 100 A residual oxide in the S/D regions adjacent to P2 layers. This doping gets to gate, drain & source of all NMOS devices and N+ interconnects. The P+ mask is used to select PMOS devices and P+ interconnect, and implanted with P+ dopant as shown in FIG. 15.5. PMOS gate, drain & source regions receive the P+ dopant. This N+/P+ implants can be done with N+ mask followed by P+ mask. The VT implanted P1 regions are now completely covered by P2 layer and spacer regions, and form channel regions of NMOS & PMOS transistors.",
        "After the P+/N+ implants, Nickel is deposited over P2 and salicided to form a low resistive refractory metal on exposed poly by RTA. Un-reacted Ni is etched as shown in FIG. 15.6. This 100 A-500 A thick Co-salicide connects the opposite doped poly-2 regions together providing low resistive poly wires for data. In one embodiment, the residual gate dielectric left after the spacer prevents P1 layer salicidation. In a second embodiment, as the residual oxide is removed over exposed P1 after spacer etch, P1 is salicided. The thickness of Ni deposition may be used to control full or partial salicidation of P1 regions. Fully salicided S/D regions up to spacer edge facilitate high drive current due to lower source and drain resistances.",
        "An LTO film is deposited over P2 layer, and polished flat with CMP. A second contact mask C2 is used to open contacts into the TFT P2 and P1 regions in addition to all other contacts to substrate transistors. In the shown embodiment, C1 contacts connecting latch outputs to substrate transistor gates require no C2 contacts. Contact plugs are filled with tungsten, CMP polished, and connected by metal as done in standard contact metallization of IC's as shown in FIG. 15.7.",
