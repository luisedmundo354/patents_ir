        "1. Field of the Disclosure",
        "The present disclosure relates to electronic devices and processes, and more particularly to an electronic device comprising a gate electrode including a metal-containing layer having one or more impurities and processes for forming the same.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "State-of-the-art semiconductor devices currently include transistors having a gate dielectric layer with one or more high dielectric constant (\u201chigh-k\u201d) materials. These materials typically have a dielectric constant higher than the silicon nitride, which is approximately seven. Conventional transistors include N+ or P+ doped silicon gate electrodes. One or more problems can occur when a silicon layer contacts a high-k gate dielectric layer. A high-k gate dielectric layer can include a metal oxide, such as ZrO2. When ZrO2 contacts silicon at an elevated temperature, such as during a source/drain anneal, silicon (e.g., from the substrate or a subsequently-formed polysilicon gate electrode) can react with at least some of the zirconium to form ZrSi2, which is conductive. In addition, some of the dopant from the N+ or P+ silicon can migrate from the silicon into the gate dielectric layer or other parts of the transistor. The dopant concentration at the silicon-gate dielectric interface becomes depleted, thereby forming a more resistive portion, which electronically, reduces the electrically measured capacitance of the gate dielectric layer within the transistor, which is undesired.",
        "High-k dielectric materials, including HfO2, ZrO2, etc., when used as a gate dielectric layer typically have metal gate electrodes, due to the potential problems when high-k dielectric materials contact silicon and potential dopant migration into the gate dielectric layer. Exemplary materials for metal gate electrodes include TiN, TaC, TaSiN, and the like.",
        "When a metal gate electrode is used, the portion of metal gate electrode closest to the gate dielectric layer establishes the work function for the gate electrode. An NMOS transistor may have TaSiN as the portion of its metal-containing gate electrode closest to the high-k gate dielectric layer, and a PMOS transistor may have TiN as the portion of its metal-containing gate electrode closest to the high-k gate dielectric layer. The work function for TaSiN is 4.3 eV, and the work function for TiN is 4.6 eV. As a basis for comparison, the work function for N+ silicon and the energy level for the conduction band (\u201cEc\u201d) for silicon is 4.1 eV, and the work function for P+ silicon and the energy level for the valence band (\u201cEv\u201d) for silicon is 5.2 eV. Therefore, the difference between Ec and the work function for TaSiN is 0.2 eV, and the difference between Ev and the work function for TiN is 0.6 eV. These differences can cause longer times to switch states (i.e., \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d) for the transistors, and therefore, result in a slower operating electronic device.",

In one embodiment, the thinner layer includes amorphous silicon to reduce the effects of implant channeling. After the ion implantation and optional anneal, a relatively thicker layer that is part of the third layer 54 is then formed over the thinner layer. The thickness of the thicker layer is in a range of approximately 10 to 100 nm.",

Many options are available for metal-containing gate electrode materials. For example, in one embodiment, the metal-containing gate electrode, without any impurity, may have a work function closer to Ec and the impurity can be added to the metal-containing gate electrode to get the work function closer to Ev, or vice versa. In another embodiment, a mid-band gap material may be used for the metal-containing gate electrode. One impurity can be used to get the work function closer to Ev, and another impurity can be used to get the work function closer to Ec. In this manner, the same material for the metal gate electrode can be deposited, and different impurities used to get the work function tailored more closely to Ev for PMOS transistors and Ec for NMOS transistors. A wider variety of materials can be used for gate electrodes with impurities used to more closely achieve desired work function(s) for the transistors within the electronic device.",

The EOT is an electrical measurement of a thickness of an insulator, as opposed to a physical measurement of the thickness. The work functions of the gate electrodes of the PMOS transistors are determined from the flat band voltages and EOTs. Table 1 includes the calculated work functions. The data indicate that the boron-containing species within the TiN layer increase the work function, and the higher energy implants produce work functions closer to Ev. The work function improves by 0.2 to 0.3 electron volts when implanting at relatively lower energies as compared to performing no implant. The work function improves by 0.5 to 0.6 electron volts when implanting at relatively higher energies as compared to performing no implant. The use of the impurity incorporation can change the work function more than just by merely switching metal-containing materials for the layer(s) that determine the work function for a gate electrode.
