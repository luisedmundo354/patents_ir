        "This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/615,885, filed Jul. 8, 2003 and entitled \u201cHIERARCHICAL DETERMINATION OF FEATURE RELEVANCY\u201d.",
        "This application relates to pattern recognition and data mining. In particular, the application relates to determining feature relevancy in multivariate data analysis of a mixed-type data set.",
        "Feature selection is of theoretical interest and practical importance in the practice of pattern recognition and data mining. Objects or data entities may be described in terms of many features. However, some features may be redundant or irrelevant for specific tasks, serving primarily as a source of confusion. In addition, for any one specific task, different subsets of features might be relevant in different regions of input data space. Accordingly feature selection is a matter of considerable interest and importance in multivariate data analysis.",
        "For example, in modeling a specific behavior of a given system, it is desirable to include only the parameters that contribute to that specific system behavior and not the ones that contribute to other behaviors of the system but are not much relevant to that specific behavior.",
        "Most of feature selection algorithms are either filter methods or wrapper methods. Filter methods use the feature selection as a preprocessing step and filter out irrelevant features before learning a model. Thus, the filter methods are independent of the learning algorithm. Wrapper methods embed the learning algorithm within the feature selection process and use the learning algorithm to evaluate the performance of the feature selection. Each approach has both advantages and disadvantages. A filter approach is usually more efficient and can be combined with any learning algorithm, while a wrapper approach can usually provide a better performance for the learning algorithm.",
        "In any event, conventional feature selection algorithms are typically adapted for processing of numerical features, but are not proficient for handling a data set of mixed data types. Improved methodologies for determining feature relevancy for mixed data types are needed.",
        "Methods for feature selection based on hierarchical local-region analysis of feature characteristics in a data set of mixed data type are described herein. A method for feature selection based on hierarchical local-region analysis of feature characteristics in a data set of mixed data type, according to one exemplary embodiment, comprises partitioning a data space associated with a mixed-type data set into a hierarchy of pluralities of local regions, using a relationship metric to evaluate for each local region a relationship measure between input features and a target, and identifying one or more relevant features, by using the relationship measure for each local region. The relationship metric preferably is or includes a similarity correlation metric (discussed below).",
        "A similarity correlation metric can be used in methods for analyzing feature characteristics in a data set of mixed data type. According to an exemplary embodiment, a method for analyzing feature characteristics in a data set of mixed data type comprises mapping a data space associated with a mixed-type data set to a distance space, and determining a relationship measure between each input feature and the target by using a distance-based relationship measure. When a similarity correlation metric is used, the relationship measure is determined by using distance correlation.",
        "The similarity correlation metric is provided to handle features of different data types, and facilitates analysis of feature relevancy by computing the correlations between input features and a target.",
        "The features of the present application can be more readily understood from the following detailed description with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein:",
        "FIG. 1A shows a flow chart of a method for feature selection based on hierarchical local-region analysis of feature characteristics in a data set of mixed data type, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present application;",
        "FIG. 1B shows a flow chart of a method for analyzing feature characteristics in a data set of mixed data type, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present application;",

        "This application provides tools for determining feature relevancy of mixed data types in multivariate data analysis. The tools of this disclosure may be a computer program stored on a computer readable medium and/or transmitted via a computer network or other transmission medium.",
        "A similarity correlation metric is discussed exemplarily below, as a new relevancy evaluation metric for an enhancement of the Hierarchical Determination of Feature Relevancy (HDFR) methodology which is discussed in U.S. application Ser. No. 10/615,885, filed Jul. 8, 2003 and entitled \u201cHIERARCHICAL DETERMINATION OF FEATURE RELEVANCY\u201d, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The enhanced HDFR methodology can be used to process features with mixed data types.",
        "The Hierarchical Determination of Feature Relevancy (HDFR) methodology can be employed for feature selection based on hierarchical local-region analysis of feature characteristics. Hierarchical k-means clustering can be applied to partition the entire data space into local regions, which may or may not be overlapping, and then for each local region evaluates each feature individually based on its correlation with the target. In each local region there might be a particular, corresponding subset of features that is relevant according to the target for the local region. The subsets do not need to be the same for different regions of input data space. In other words, a feature or subset of features might not show strong relevancy to a particular task over the entire range of data but might show strong relevancy over different delineated regions. Such a feature is still considered relevant and can be identified for use in the appropriate regions.",
        "A typical implementation of the HDFR methodology utilizes a linear correlation metric to evaluate the relevancy of a feature. The linear correlation metric computes the R-squared correlation between the feature and the target. However, the R-squared correlation computation is applied to numerical values. In order to use the linear correlation metric, non-numerical features (such as symbolic ones) are converted to numerical form by using conversion techniques such as, for example, cross tabulation. Cross tabulation converts a symbolic feature into many numerical features corresponding to the distinctive symbolic values. Such conversion often results in very large number of cross tabulated features with mostly 0 entries, which increases not only the computational cost but also the risks of discovering accidental relationships.",
        "On the other hand, some advances have been made in handling non-numerical features in machine learning techniques. For example, as disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 10/418,659, filed Apr. 18, 2003 and entitled \u201cPROCESSING MIXED NUMERIC AND NON-NUMERIC DATA\u201d, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, some similarity metrics such as set distance metric are designed to compute the distance of non-numerical values. Such similarity metrics can be used in learning methodologies such as hierarchical k-means clustering which can be utilized in the HDFR methodology. Therefore, the HDFR methodology can be adapted to have the capability of partitioning data space with non-numerical features. However, in order to evaluate relevancy of non-numerical features, a new relevancy evaluation metric other than the typical linear metric is desirable. A similarity correlation metric is discussed below as a new relevancy evaluation metric which adapts existing similarity metrics to compute the similarities of features and a target, and then computes the correlations between the similarities of input features and the similarities of the target.",
        "A method for feature selection based on hierarchical local-region analysis of feature characteristics in a data set of mixed data type is described below with reference to FIG. 1A. A data space associated with a mixed-type data set is partitioned into a hierarchy of plural local regions (step S11). A relationship metric (for example, a similarity correlation metric) is used to evaluate for each local region a relationship measure between input features and a target (step S13). One or more relevant features is identified, by using the relationship measure for each local region (step S15). The relationship metric preferably includes a similarity correlation metric.",
        "According to another embodiment, a method for analyzing feature characteristics in a data set of mixed data type (FIG. 1B) can be adapted to use the similarity correlation metric. A data space associated with a mixed-type data set is mapped to a distance space (step S17). A relationship measure between each input feature and the target is determined by using a distance-based relationship measure (step S19). When a similarity correlation metric is used, the relationship measure is determined by using distance correlation.",
        "In typical implementations of HDFR (heretofore), the linear correlation metric was used to evaluate the feature relevancy. The linear correlation metric computes the R-squared correlation between a feature and the target. Assume a numerical input feature is x and the numerical target is y. The R-squared value between x and y represents the proportion of the variance in y attributable to the variance in x. Given observed pairs, (xi, yi), i=1\u02dcn, the mathematical formulation of R-square value is:",

        "Consider the simple nonlinear case y=x2, where x is from \u2212\u221e to +\u221e. A R-squared correlation score of 0 is obtained by using the linear correlation metric which results from the cancellation of negative correlation of x and y when x is negative, and the positive correlation of x and y when x is positive. The similarity correlation metric uses two steps to evaluate correlation between x and y. First it maps the original space to the distance space. Assume the mean of x is 0. The mapping results in function dist.y=(dist.x)2. The similarity correlation metric then computes the linear correlation between dist.x and dist.y. But due to the space mapping there is no more negative correlation between dist.x and dist.y. Therefore, a high similarity correlation score of 0.969 is obtained.",
        "The effect of space mapping is similar to space partitioning under the HDFR methodology. The HDFR methodology can partition (x, y) space along axis x=0 and then compute the correlation between x and y in two partitioned spaces. The space mapping is to fold the original space along axis x=0 and y=0 and compute the correlation in the folded space. Both techniques can be targeted to identify the nonlinear relations.",

The mixed-type data space is partitioned initially into two regions (step S21). For each of the regions in the present level of the hierarchy, a similarity correlation metric is utilized to evaluate feature relevancies based on samples in the region (step S22). The feature relevancies in the level are used to identify relevant features which have significantly larger relevancies than the others (step S23). If no new relevant features can be identified for a certain number of levels (step S24, \u201cNO\u201d) or a specified maximum number of levels is reached (step S25, \u201cYES\u201d), the feature relevancies can be summarized at all of the levels and a list of relevant features and their relevancies provided (step S27). The local regions in the current level are split further for the next level (step S26), until no new relevant features can be identified for a specified or predetermined number of iterations or a specified maximum number of levels is reached.",
        "The performance of the enhanced HDFR methodology is discussed exemplarily through two examples below. One example is the extended parity-2 problem and the other is the three Monk's problems. The extended parity-2 problem is from the well-known parity-2 problem, but extended to use inputs and output of continuous values. Some random noise inputs are also added to see if the enhanced HDFR methodology can still work on numerical features. The three Monk's problems have been used as a standard for comparing many different learning methodologies. The problems have discrete input features and the first and the third problems can be used as feature selection tasks.",
        "The parity-2 problem is a well-known problem. In this problem, the output is the mod-2 sum of two binary input features. It is extended by using continuous inputs and output. A nonlinear equation is used to simulate the problem:\n\ny=x1+x2\u22122*x1*x2 \n\nwhere x1, x2 and y \u03b5 [0, 1]",
        "A 3-D plot of the above equation is shown in FIG. 3.",
        "For testing purposes, 8 random input features, x3 to x10, are added as noise and 500 samples are randomly generated. The task is to identify the relevant features, x1 and x2, from the noise features, x3 to x10.",
        "Estimated feature relevancies obtained by applying the enhanced HDFR methodology to the data of the extended parity-2 problem are shown tabularly in FIG. 4. The results show that the relevant features, x1 and x2, have significantly larger relevancy values than other noise features. This demonstrates that the enhanced HDFR methodology using a similarity correlation metric can still identify the relevant numerical features.",
        "The Monk's problems have been used as a standard for comparing many different learning methodologies. There are six input features, x1, x2, . . . , x6, and one binary target y. Among the six input features, both feature x3 and x6 have only two discrete values and they are treated as binary numerical features. All of the other features have multiple discrete values and are treated as non-numerical features. The target y is binary and treated as numerical. The following is the definition of Monk's problems:\n\n    \n    \n        Monk-1: y=1 if (x1=x2) or (x5=1), otherwise y=0.",
        "Monk-2: y=1 if exactly two of {x1=1, x2=1, x3=1, x4=1, x5=1, x6=1}, otherwise y=0.",
        "Monk-3: y=1 if (x5=3 and x4=1) or (x5\u22604 and x2\u22603), otherwise y=0 (5% class noise added to the training set).",
        "From the definition one can check what features are relevant to the problems. For the first problem, one can see that only three features, x1, x2 and x5, are relevant to the problem. For the second problem, all six features are relevant to the problem. For the third problem, three features, x2, x4 and x5, are relevant to the problem. Therefore, the first and the third problem can be used as feature selection tasks. Exemplary feature relevancy values obtained by applying the enhanced HDFR methodology to the three Monk's problems is set forth in FIG. 5.",
        "As can be seen from the estimated feature relevancies shown tabularly in FIG. 5, the ranks of feature x1, x2 and x5 in the first problem are 2, 4 and 1 respectively. The ranks of feature x2, x4 and x5 in the third problem are 1, 5 and 2 respectively. Feature x4 in the third problem does not rank higher as might expect it to be. However, this is not surprising because the relevancy of feature x4 is actually very small from the problem definition. Without feature x4, only 12 out of 228 positive examples cannot be defined. Furthermore, the 5% class noise added to the dataset also diminishes the chance of methodologies to identify feature x4 as a relevant feature.",
        "This disclosure describes a new feature relevancy evaluation metric, the similarity correlation metric, which enhances the HDFR methodology, for handling features with mixed data types. Experiment results show that the enhanced HDFR methodology works well for features of both numerical and non-numerical data types.",
        "The enhanced HDFR methodology can be adapted for any of various applications. For example, it can be integrated in a context-sensitive search engine. As another example, it can be adapted to be applied in intelligent software for monitoring electronic communications (such as e-mails, instant messages, other Internet communications, etc.). In addition, the enhanced HDFR methodology can be integrated in a system for cataloging textual information (such as news stories, books, scientific papers, etc.). It can be used by on-line book vendors to automatically suggest alternative titles when a book sought by a customer is not available (or even if it is available). Numerous other applications of the enhanced HDFR methodology are possible.",
