        "Botanical designation: Euphorbia pulcherrima.",
        "Cultivar denomination: \u2018PER8603\u2019.",
        "The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Poinsettia plant, botanically known as Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd., and hereinafter referred to by the name \u2018PER8603\u2019.",
        "The new Poinsettia a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the Inventor in Encinitas, Calif. The objective of the breeding program is to create new Poinsettia cultivars having flower bracts with desirable colors, uniform plant habit and excellent post-production longevity.",
        "The new Poinsettia is a naturally-occurring branch mutation of a proprietary selection of Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd. identified as 5-01, not patented. The cultivar \u2018PER8603\u2019 was discovered and selected by the Inventor from within a population of plants of the parent selection a controlled environment in Encinitas, Calif. in December, 2002.",
        "Asexual reproduction of the new Poinsettia by terminal vegetative cuttings in a controlled environment in Encinitas, Calif. since February, 2003, has shown that the unique features of this new Poinsettia are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations of asexual reproduction.",
        "The cultivar \u2018PER8603\u2019 has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature, daylength and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype.",
        "The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of \u2018PER8603\u2019. These characteristics in combination distinguish \u2018PER8603\u2019 as a new and distinct cultivar of Poinsettia:\n\n    \n    \n        1. Uniform, upright, outwardly spreading and mounded plant habit.\n        2. Freely branching habit.\n        3. Dark green-colored leaves.\n        4. Late season flowering response; under natural season conditions, plants flower in about 9 weeks in Encinitas, Calif.\n        5. Inflorescences with pink and creamy white bi-colored flower bracts.\n        6. Excellent post-production longevity.",
        "In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Encinitas, Calif., plants of the new Poinsettia differed from plants of the parent selection, primarily in flower bract color as plants of the parent selection had pink-colored flower bracts.",
        "Plants of the new Poinsettia can be compared to plants of the Poinsettia cultivar Peterstar Pink, disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No. 9,879. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Encinitas, Calif., plants of the new Poinsettia differed from plants of the cultivar Peterstar Pink in the following characteristics:\n\n    \n    \n        1. Plants of the new Poinsettia had darker green-colored leaves than plants of the cultivar Peterstar Pink.\n        2. Plants of the new Poinsettia flowered about a week later than plants of the cultivar Peterstar Pink grown under natural season conditions.\n        3. Plants of the new Poinsettia and the cultivar Peterstar Pink differed in flower bract coloration as plants of the cultivar Peterstar Pink had pink-colored flower bracts.",
        "The accompanying photographs illustrate the overall appearance of the new Poinsettia. These photographs show the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photographs may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description which accurately describe the colors of the new Poinsettia.",
        "The photograph at the bottom of sheet comprises a side perspective view of a typical flowering plant of \u2018PER8603\u2019 grown in a container.",
        "The photograph at the top of the sheet is a close-up view of a typical inflorescence of \u2018PER8603\u2019.",
        "In the following description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, 1995 Edition, except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used. The following observations and measurements describe plants grown in Encinitas, Calif. during the winter in a polyethylene-covered greenhouse and under conditions and practices which approximate those generally used in commercial Poinsettia production. During the production of the plants, day temperatures averaged 24\u00b0 C., night averaged 19\u00b0 C. and light levels were about 4,000 foot-candles.
