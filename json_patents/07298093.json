        "The invention relates to a cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) circuit and, more particularly, to devices for rapidly lighting a CCFL.",
        "CCFL is a widely used light source in electronic devices such as scanners, LCD panels, notebook PCs and LCD televisions. Illumination of a conventional CCFL, however, may take up to 3 minutes to achieve stability after power up. FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a conventional electronic device 10 comprising a CCFL circuit. Electronic device 10 comprises a power supply 11 and a CCFL circuit 12 comprising at least one CCFL 121. Power supply 11 provides a voltage DC1 to the CCFL circuit 12. CCFL circuit 12 generates a high voltage AC supply according to the voltage DC1 to light CCFL 121.",
        "A method to drive a CCFL is provided by Johnson, et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,907,742, \u201cLamp control scheme for rapid warm-up of fluorescent lamp in office equipment\u201d). The lamp is over-driven with high current for up to a predetermined time limit to accelerate mercury vaporization. The drive current is then reduced to a normal level. Between each use, the lower lamp current is 40% of the normal level to keep the lamp warm while extending the life of the product.",
        "Using Johnson's Method, a certain amount of power is required when the CCFL is not working to maintain the temperature of the CCFL. The power consumed at the lower lamp current state is significant and additional logic circuits are required for controlling current in different states. Furthermore, if a longer length CCFL is utilized in electronic device 10, to raise the current when lighting the CCFLs, the CCFL circuit 12 receives higher voltage DC1 and generates higher voltage AC power. Consequently, transformers used in CCFL circuit 12 may not be capable of sustaining such a high voltage and may need to be upgraded, which leads to additional manufacturing cost.",
        "A driving device for a CCFL circuit comprising at least one CCFL is provided. The driving device comprises: at least one heating device controlling the temperature of the CCFL; a power supply outputting a first voltage; a switching device having a first input terminal receiving the first voltage and a first and second output terminal outputting a second and third voltage respectively. The first output terminal is coupled to the CCFL circuit to output the second voltage when the first voltage is higher than a first level. The second output terminal is coupled to the heating device to output the third voltage when the first voltage is lower than the first level. The driving device further comprises a controller controlling the power supply to output the first voltage higher than the first level to light the CCFL, and lower than the first level to control the temperature of the CCFL.",

The second output terminal is coupled to the heating device 214 outputting the third voltage DC3 when the first voltage DC1 is lower than the first level V1. In this embodiment, the controller 211 controls the power supply 212 to output the first DC voltage DC1 higher than the first level V1 to light the CCFL 221. The voltage switching device 213 provides the second DC voltage DC2 to the CCFL circuit 22 for lighting the CCFL 221. Simultaneously, the third DC voltage DC3 is cut off.

The voltage switching device 213 cuts off the second DC voltage DC2 and the power supply 212 snuffs out the CCFL 221. Simultaneously, the third DC voltage DC3 is output. The heating device 214 heats the CCFL 221 such that the CCFL 221 is rapidly lit when required next time.",

Switching unit 2132 is OFF when the first voltage is higher than the first level V1, and is ON when the first voltage is lower than the first level V1.",
        "In this embodiment, a simply two-state DC voltage control method is utilized to control a boot mode and a sleep mode of the CCFL. In the sleep mode, the CCFL is idle and stops receiving current. In the sleep mode, the temperature of the CCFL is maintained such that the power consumption caused by the CCFL is solved.",
        "A second level V2 higher than the first level V1 is provided for an extra function of this embodiment. The function of the first output terminal of switching device 23 remains the same. The second output terminal of switching device 23 outputs the third voltage DC3 when the first voltage DC1 is lower than the first level V1 or higher than the second level V2. In this embodiment, when the first voltage is higher than the second level V2, the CCFL is lit and the heating device 214 heats the CCFL 221. The temperature of the CCFL 221 may be increased rapidly and illumination of the CCFL 221 may rapidly reach the working illumination.",
        "FIG. 2C is a block diagram of another embodiment of the switching device 23 of FIG. 2A. Switching device 23 comprises switching units 2131 and 2132.

The voltage switching device 213 cuts off the second DC voltage DC2 such that the CCFL circuit 22 snuffs out the CCFL 221. Simultaneously, the third DC voltage DC3 is output such that the heating device 214 heats the CCFL 221. Thus, the CCFL 221 is lit rapidly when required next time.",

The voltage switching device 213 provides the second DC voltage DC2 to the CCFL circuit 22 for lighting the CCFL 221. Simultaneously, the third DC voltage DC3 is output such that the heating device 214 heats the CCFL 221. Thus, the temperature of the CCFL 221 rapidly arrives an operation temperature.",
        "In this embodiment, a simply three-state DC voltage control method is utilized to control a rapid light mode, a boot mode, and a sleep mode of the CCFL. In the rapid light mode, since the CCFL is heated, the CCFL is not required to receiving a higher current and the CCFL is rapidly lit. In the sleep mode, the CCFL is idle and the CCFL is not required to receive current. In the sleep mode. the temperature of the CCFL is maintained such that the power consumption caused by the CCFL is solved.",
