        "This application cross-references two co-pending non-provisional U.S. patent applications filed on herewith on Sep. 12, 2003; namely, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/661,920 entitled, \u201cLithium-Limited Anode Subassembly with Solid Anode Current Collector and Spacer\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/661,666 entitled, \u201cSpacer Separator Subassembly\u201d the contents of both are hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "The present invention relates to the field of electrochemical cells, and, more particularly, the present invention relates to an anode subassembly for use in implantable electrochemical cells.",
        "Implantable cardiac stimulation devices, such as defibrillators and pacemakers, are used to treat patients suffering from cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac dysfunction. In operation, such devices may continuously monitor the electrical activity of the heart and deliver appropriate stimulation therapies to normalize electrical or mechanical dysfunction. Cardiac stimulation devices must possess low self-discharge in order to have a useful life of many months, and must be highly reliable to provide a needed therapy whenever necessary. In implantable defibrillators, the power source must have a high rate capability to provide the necessary charge to the capacitors for delivering high-energy shocks. In addition, since cardiac stimulation devices are implanted, the battery must be able to supply energy from a minimum packaged volume.",
        "Batteries or electrochemical cells are volumetrically constrained systems. The size or volume of components that go into a battery (cathode, anode, separator, current collectors, electrolyte, etc.) cannot exceed the available volume of the battery case. In addition, the appropriate amount of some components depends on the amount of other components that are used. These components must be \u201cbalanced\u201d to provide discharge to the extent desired.",
        "In a conventional cathode-limited battery such as a lithium-silver vanadium oxide (LiSVO) battery commonly used in cardiac stimulation devices, the capacity (Q+) of the cathode must not exceed the capacity (Q\u2212) of the anode. Cathode limited cells have been used in battery powered implantable medical devices such as heart pacemakers because of the proven reliability of their discharge over the long periods during which they are implanted. The volume occupied by the other battery components also depends on the cathode capacity (Q+) as reflected by the amount of cathode material in the battery. The amount of electrolyte depends on the amount of cathode material and the amount of it to be discharged since the cathode material can swell as the battery is discharged and requires more electrolyte to fill the additional cathode volume. The volume of the separator and current collector depends on the area of the electrodes. The area of the electrodes depends on the area required for consistent pulse output as the battery is discharged. All of these components must be adjusted for a given battery volume.",
        "One method for constructing a lithium anode cell is to wind cathode and anode elements together to form a cylindrical or oblong coil. In a coiled design, anode material is available on either side of the cathode windings and will deplete into the cathode as the battery is discharged. Reliable performance is assured by having an excess of anode capacity beyond the usable capacity desired of the cathode. This excess lithium is distributed through the length of the anode. The lithium winding forming the outermost winding of the coil has cathode material adjacent to its inner circumference but not on the outer circumference. Therefore the outermost winding of the anode need only be half the thickness of the inner windings. If an anode is constructed from a single piece of foil that is of uniform thickness, there is an additional excess of lithium on the outermost winding of the coil.",
        "One disadvantage of a cathode-limited cell is that the excess lithium in the cell may reduce other materials after the cathode is fully discharged, which can lead to cell swelling. In order to prevent damage to circuitry within the implantable device surrounding the cell due to cell swelling, a reinforcing stainless steel plate may be provided against the cell. This stainless steel plate occupies valuable space in an implantable device and adds weight to the overall device. In regard to implantable medical devices, a reduced size and weight is desirable to ease the implant procedure and avoid patient discomfort at the implant site. Eliminating the excess lithium or the need for the stainless steel plate would allow the cell size, and therefore the overall size of the medical device, to be reduced. Alternatively, the volume occupied by excess lithium and the steel plate could otherwise be taken up by cathode material to increase the battery capacity.",
        "Another disadvantage of a cathode-limited cell is that its resistance increases as a function of time after the cell is discharged to the second voltage plateau on its discharge curve. By limiting the amount of lithium and electrolyte material in the cell, the cell may be designed to utilize only the first voltage plateau. Superior long-term cell performance can be achieved since the same useful capacity can be provided as in a conventionally balanced cell but at a higher voltage toward the end of the discharge cycle. A lithium-limited balanced cell having these advantages is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,997 to Crespi et al, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
        "In a coiled, anode-limited cell it is desirable to reduce the excess anode material present in the outermost winding that does not interface cathode material on both sides. One method for manufacturing an anode-limited cell that eliminates the excess anode material involves layering two lithium foil pieces. One lithium foil is provided long enough to form all of the windings in a coil, and the other lithium foil is provided long enough to form only the inner windings. When the two foils are overlaid and coiled with a cathode, the inner coil windings are formed by a double layer of lithium foil and the outermost winding by a single layer of lithium foil.",
        "Another method for reducing excess lithium in an anode-limited cell is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/123,495 filed 15 Apr. 2002 and entitled, \u201cBalanced Anode Electrode\u201d (Atty. Dkt. P-10327.00) invented by Aamodt et al., the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "The disclosed method utilizes a short, thin lithium foil joined to a long, thick lithium foil such that the shorter, thinner foil will form the outermost coil winding and the longer thicker foil will form all of the inner windings. This method advantageously provides a narrow tolerance of the anode material for fully gaining the benefits of an anode-limited cell.",
        "The anode current collector is commonly provided as a perforated conductive material such as a perforated nickel or titanium (e.g., a grid or screen). During assembly, the anode current collector is pressed against the anode material such that the anode material becomes enmeshed with the openings in the anode current collector. In this way, the openings in the anode current collector grid act to strengthen the mechanical joint between the current collector and the anode material and prevent separation of these components. The anode current collector further acts to provide reinforcement to the thin lithium layer in the outermost winding of a lithium-limited cell.",
        "A limitation exists, however, in coiled anode-limited cells of this type relating to the potential for a short to occur between the cathode material and the anode current collector. When the thin layer of lithium has substantially depleted into the cathode in the outermost winding, the cathode may press into the anode current collector potentially causing a short. The anode current collector may extend the length of the coil windings but is typically positioned only on the outermost coil winding. The inventors of the present invention have discovered that, when the anode material becomes depleted toward the end of cell discharge, the cathode material may exert a force sufficient to press against the anode current collector. Cracks that naturally and commonly occur in coiled cathode material create exposed edges of the cathode material that when forced against the edges of the perforations or holes in the anode current collector grid, particularly in the final turn of the outermost winding of a coiled electrode assembly, can also contribute to the problem. Even if a robust separator material layer is present between the cathode and anode subassemblies, the separator material may tear when pressed between a cathode crack edge and an anode current collector edge. The possibility exists, therefore, for an electrical short to occur between the cathode material and anode current collector.",
        "Though this mechanism is likely highly infrequent, it could result in potentially serious consequences for an implanted or difficult to retrieve electronic device. Thus, an improved anode subassembly design is warranted which overcomes the potential failure mechanism described above, particularly in anode-limited cells but potentially in any cell in which cathode cracking may precipitate a short between the cathode and anode.",
        "The present invention addresses the limitations described above by providing an anode subassembly that includes an anode current collector designed to eliminate perforation or grid edges in the last turn of the outermost coil winding. The anode subassembly includes the anode current collector mechanically pressed against an alkali metal anode to thereby promote secure attachment between the anode current collector and anode material. The anode subassembly has a leading edge and a trailing edge. The anode subassembly may be enveloped within a separator and wound with a cathode subassembly to form a coiled electrode assembly, beginning with the leading edge of the anode subassembly at the center of the coil and ending with the trailing edge on the outermost coil winding. The outermost coil winding includes: a first turn; a first generally straight segment; a second turn, which is the last or final turn of the coil; and a second generally straight segment.",
        "One aspect of the present invention is the elimination of anode current collector perforation edges from the second turn of the outermost winding, where a short is most likely to occur as described above. In one embodiment, an anode current collector grid of reduced size is provided such that the anode current collector grid is positioned only on the second straight segment of the outermost coil.",
        "In another embodiment, the anode current collector is provided as a discontinuous grid formed in two sections. The first current collector section is positioned along the first turn and first generally straight segment of the outermost winding and the second current collector section is positioned along the second generally straight segment of the outermost winding.",
        "In yet another embodiment, the anode current collector is formed from alternating perforated or grid areas and solid areas. A first solid area may be provided at the leading edge of the anode current collector, which will reinforce an area of overlap between relatively thick and thin pieces of alkali metal foil used for forming the alkali metal anode. Next, a first perforated area will correspond to the area of the first generally straight segment of the outermost winding. Next, a second solid area is provided for positioning along the second turn of the outermost winding, and lastly a second perforated area is provided for positioning along the second generally straight segment of the outermost winding.",
        "Another aspect of the present invention is to provide reinforcement of the thin anode material forming the outermost coil winding to improve the handling properties of the anode subassembly and/or reinforcing a seam, also referred to herein as the \u201carea of overlap\u201d, between two pieces of alkali metal used to fabricate the alkali metal anode.",
        "In some embodiments, reinforcement is achieved by providing a reduced-size anode current collector with one or more extension members for extending across an area of overlap between thin and thick pieces of alkali metal anode material. The anode current collector extension member(s) provide reinforcement of the area of overlap. The extension member(s) additionally provide support to the thin alkali metal piece forming the outermost coil winding.",
        "Additionally or alternatively, reinforcement is achieved by including a spacer in the anode subassembly for reinforcing the thin alkali metal anode in areas not supported by a reduced-size or discontinuous anode current collector. The spacer may be pressed onto the alkali metal anode on the side opposite the anode current collector. In one embodiment, the spacer is formed from a film of microporous, non-conductive material such as polyethylene or polypropylene. In another embodiment, the spacer is formed from a perforated sheet of a fluoropolymer, such as a perforated sheet of ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE).",
        "A reinforcing spacer may be positioned along the area of overlap between a thin and thick piece of alkali metal material used to form the alkali metal anode. The spacer may extend along the inner surface of the anode on the first turn of the outermost winding, the first generally straight segment of the outermost winding and/or the second turn of the outermost winding when a reduced-size anode current collector is positioned along the second generally straight segment of the outermost winding. The spacer may be positioned between the first and second sections of a discontinuous anode current collector, on the opposite side of the alkali metal anode from the anode current collector, to reinforce the thin alkali metal anode between the anode current collector sections.",
        "In yet other embodiments, reinforcement is achieved by pressing strips of alkali metal onto the anode to add reinforcement along the top and bottom edges of at least a portion of the outermost winding and/or along the seam between thin and thick pieces of alkali metal used to form the alkali metal anode.",
        "In still another embodiment, an anode current collector subassembly is provided including two anode current collector sections and an intervening spacer. The anode current collector subassembly is pressed onto an alkali metal anode to form the anode subassembly. The anode current collector subassembly is positioned on the anode such that a first current collector section will be positioned along the first turn and the first straight segment of the outermost winding, the spacer will be positioned along the second turn of the outermost winding and provide reinforcement of the anode thereto, and a second current collector section will be positioned along the second straight segment of the outermost winding.",

However, it is expected that the benefits of the present invention may also be realized in cathode-limited cells wherein cracks in the cathode material, in particular in cells having relatively thick cathode material, may lead to shorting between the cathode and anode.",
        "While a variety of battery configurations and constructions are possible for anode-or cathode-limited cells, the methods included in the present invention are particularly suited for batteries having folded, coiled or wrapped electrode configurations, such as the batteries disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,486,215 issued to Kelm et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 6,051,038 issued to Howard et al, both patents incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The inventors of the present invention have recognized that a shorting failure can potentially occur in a coiled, lithium-limited cell between the cathode material and the anode current collector on the outermost winding as the thin lithium layer depletes into the cathode during cell discharge. The inventors have further recognized that this potential failure mechanism, though expectedly rare, is most likely to occur in the last turn of the coil, in the outermost winding, if it occurs at all.",
        "FIG. 1A is a top plan view of an anode subassembly 1 to be included in an electrochemical cell according to one embodiment of the present invention. The anode subassembly 1 includes an anode current collector grid 5 attached to an alkali metal anode 3 formed from two pieces of anode material, 10 and 15. The anode current collector 5 is a flat, thin conductive metal grid or perforated conductive metal that is corrosion-resistant when associated with the alkali metal pieces 10 and 15. The anode current collector 5 is preferably fabricated from titanium, nickel, copper or an alloy of nickel or copper.

The alkali metal pieces 10 and 15 are preferably foils formed of lithium metal or an alloy of lithium. The two foil pieces 10 and 15 are partially overlapped to provide an interfacing area for forming a cohesive bond between the two pieces 10 and 15. The area of overlap 8 is preferably kept as narrow as possible to avoid excess lithium but still provide a stable cohesive bond. The cohesive bond is formed at the area of overlap 8 using high pressure.",

The thin lithium foil 15, supported by anode current collector grid 5 in a limited area, may be vulnerable to creasing or tearing during assembly procedures. By reinforcing the thin lithium foil 15 and area of overlap 8 with spacer 30, anode subassembly 1 handling properties are improved.",

A spacer or a reinforcement element may be provided over the area of overlap 8, as described previously, if added support of the area of overlap 8 between thick and thin alkali metal pieces 10 and 15 is desired.",
        "Assembly of the electrode assembly 120 into an exemplary battery is shown in FIGS. 16 through 18. In FIG. 16, a coil insulator 200 is placed onto the electrode assembly 120. The coil insulator includes a notch 202 to accommodate anode connector tab 20 and slit 206 to accommodate cathode connector tab 70. The electrode assembly 120 is also inserted into an insulating case liner 210. The case liner 210 preferably extends at its top edge above the edge of the electrode assembly 120 in order to provide an overlap with other insulating elements. If so, it may include a notch 211 on one side in order to allow the connection of the anode connector tab 20 to the case 220, for a case negative battery. The coil insulator 200 and case liner 210 are preferably made from a polyolefin polymer or a fluoropolymer such as PTFE or PCTFE. The electrode assembly 120 and case liner 210 are then inserted into a battery case 220, preferably made of stainless steel or titanium. The battery case 220 is shown as a prismatic, deep-drawn case in FIG. 16, however, the electrode assembly 120 may be placed in battery cases that are non-prismatic, e.g., having arcuate geometries, and/or shallow rather than deep as generally disclosed in commonly-assigned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/260,629 filed 30 Sep. 2002, entitled, \u201cContoured Battery for Implantable Medical Devices and Method of Manufacture,\u201d and invented by Aamodt et al.",
        "In FIG. 17 a case cover 230 and a pin insulator 240 are shown along with the electrode assembly 120 and case 220. The case cover 230 has a glassed-in feedthrough 232 and feedthrough pin 233 extending through an aperture in the case cover 230 that has a bend 234 which is intended to place the feedthrough 232 in alignment with the cathode connector tab 70. The case cover 230 also has a fill port 236. Later in the battery assembly process, an appropriate electrolyte solution is introduced through the fill port 236, and the fill port 236 is sealed. The electrolyte solution can be an alkali metal salt in an organic solvent such as a lithium salt (i.e., 1.0M LiClO4 or LiAsF6) in a 50/50 mixture of propylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane. The sealing process may include, for example, making a first seal by pressing a plug into the aperture of the fill port 236 and making a second seal by welding a cap or disc over the fill port 236. Material utilized for leak checking hermetic seals may be included between the first and second seals.",
        "The case cover 230 is made from stainless steel, and the feedthrough pin 233 is preferably niobium or molybdenum. The pin insulator 240 has an aperture 242 leading into a raised portion 244 which receives the feedthrough pin 233 and insulates the feedthrough pin 233 from contact with the case cover 230. In combination with one side of the coil insulator 200, which is immediately below the pin insulator 240, the raised portion forms a chamber, which isolates the cathode connection. Additional insulation in the form of tubing or a coating may also be included on the feedthrough pin 233 and feedthrough 232 at locations that will not be welded to further insulate the feedthrough pin 233 and feedthrough 232. An optional cover insulator could be applied to the underside of the case cover 230 to provide additional insulation for the case cover 230.",
        "The feedthrough pin 233 is welded to the cathode connector tab 70 as shown in FIG. 18. The anode connector tab 20 is welded to the side of the case 220 thereby making the metal case 220 one terminal or contact for the battery (i.e. a case negative design). The feedthrough pin 233 is then inserted through a split in the pin insulator 240 until it projects through the aperture 242 of the pin insulator 240. The electrode assembly 120 may be out of the case 220 during some of the welding and bending operations. The case cover 230 is then welded to the case 220 to seal the electrode assembly 120 in the case. The cathode connection is thoroughly isolated from the portions of the battery at anode potential, and the feedthrough connection is thoroughly isolated from stray particles of material from the cathode and from anode particles that may form during discharge of the battery.",
        "Thus, an electrochemical cell has been disclosed having an anode subassembly designed to reduce the risk of a short occurring between the cathode and the anode. Furthermore, the cell volume occupied by the anode current collector may advantageously be reduced, and the anode subassembly is reinforced for improved handling properties. While the embodiments described herein have been directed toward a lithium-limited cell having a coiled electrode configuration, it is recognized that aspects of the present invention may be beneficially implemented in other types of cells, either anode-or cathode-limited cells, having a variety electrode configurations. The disclosed embodiments are therefore intended to be exemplary, rather than limiting, with regard to the following claims."
