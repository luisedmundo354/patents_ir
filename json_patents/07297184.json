        "More preferably, the separating layer has a chemical affinity for the at least one first gas. A group II metal oxide, preferably magnesium oxide, may be added, optionally in place of the silica and molecular sieve, to increase the chemical affinity of the at least one first gas towards the membrane.",
        "According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus to separate at least one first gas from a mixture comprising the at least one first gas and at least one second gas, the apparatus comprising a first tube and a second tube, the first tube comprising a membrane adapted to permit passage of the at least one first gas therethrough whilst substantially preventing passage of the at least one second gas therethrough, the first tube being mounted substantially within the second tube and being sealed therein by a graphite seal.",

The procedure is repeated a number of times until the layer is of the required thickness, normally between 1-12 \u03bcm, preferably 6 \u03bcm. FIG. 4 shows the membrane thickness in relation to deposition time and No. of dips.",
        "When a CO2 molecule collides with the separation layer 3 of the inorganic membrane 1, it may be adsorbed into the separation layer 3 and proceed through the pores 5 in the support 2. The CO2 molecule continues through the support 2 and is recovered along with other CO2 molecules by any suitable means.",
        "In contrast, when a CH4 molecule collides with the separation layer 3 of the inorganic membrane 1, it is unlikely to be adsorbed into the separation layer 3 and will instead continue through the bore of the tube of the inorganic membrane 1 where it may be collected along with other CH4 molecules. Generally, CH4 molecules form bonds with the separation layer 3 less readily than CO2 molecules.",
        "Carbon dioxide is currently injected downhole to increase the rate of recovery of production fluids from reservoirs. The present invention therefore provides a means to obtain carbon dioxide proximate to where it may be used. A continuous loop is thus formed in which carbon dioxide is recovered from the natural gas and may be utilised to recover further production fluids. Indeed the CO2 may never need to be transported to the surface as it may be transported from the membrane 1 to the reinjection point which saves on further time and cost.",
        "The inorganic membrane may be formed as a flat sheet or preferably, in thin tubes having an inner diameter of, for example 3-11 mm and an outer diameter of for example 5-12 mm. The gaseous mixture 4 is directed through the inner bore of this tube membrane 1. Such tubes may be coiled or corrugated to increase the number of collisions between the molecules in the gaseous mixture 4 and the inner surface of the inorganic membrane 1.",
        "An example of the tube arrangement suitable for use in accordance with the present invention is shown in FIG. 7.",
        "A tubular stainless steel vessel 9 comprises an inner tube 11, inlet ports 13, 17 and a seal 12. The inner tube 11 is made from the inorganic membrane 1 and the outer tube 10 can be made from any suitable material, such as stainless steel. Normally approximately 10 tubes are used in any one vessel 9, although only one end 15 of one tube is shown in FIG. 7. Certain embodiments of the invention with high flow rates may use more than 10 tubes. The seal 12 is preferably made from graphite as this is compressible, inert, high-temperature resistant to enable permeability studies at elevated temperatures, and cost effective. The second end 16 of the vessel 9 is not shown in FIG. 7, but typically mirrors the configuration of the first end 15.",
        "The gaseous mixture 4 is injected through the inlet port 13 into the annulus 14 between the inner 11 and outer 10 tubes. In this example CO2 molecules are separated from CH4 molecules, but other mixtures may be separated. The mixture 4 flows through the annulus 14, the CO2 molecules selectively adsorbing in the inorganic membrane 1 which forms the tube 11. The second end 16 of the inner tube 11 of the vessel 9 corresponds to a first outlet (not shown), and the second end 16 of the annulus 14 of the vessel 9 corresponds to a second outlet (not shown). The relatively pure CH4 and CO2 are recovered separately through their respective outlets. A sweep gas 18 may optionally be injected through the inlet 17 of the inner tube 11, to increase the flow rate of the CO2 therein.",
        "A simplified embodiment of the tube 11 is shown in FIG. 2 with like parts labelled correspondingly.",
        "The efficiency of the membrane 1 in separating CO2 from natural gas is dependent on both the geometry in terms of surface area and flow rate and the membrane 1 characteristics. The tests conducted to date have only considered the factors relating to the membrane and not optimised the geometry. Hence a standard test set up can be used for all testing.",
        "Thus the measures of selectivity and efficiency relate to a staged separation factor. The tests are conducted in two stages using the equipment as per FIG. 2 or FIG. 7.",
        "In a first test, a feed gas was introduced in known CO2 and CH4 composition and mass flow rates and the permeate gas is fed through a flow meter and the concentration of the permeate is analysed ignoring the sweep gas. This gives a measure of the staged separation factor. The retentate gas is free to exhaust.",
        "To calculate the Staged Separation Factor (SSF), the following formula is used:\n\nSSF =(Conc. Of CH4/Conc. Of CO2 in permeate)/(Conc. Of CH4/Conc. of CO2 in feed)\u00d7100",
        "Therefore the lower the SSF the better is the separation efficiency of the separating means (in this case membranes).",
        "In the second test, a feed gas is introduced in known CO2 and CH4 composition and mass flow rates and the retentate gas is fed through a flow meter and the concentration of the retentate is analysed ignoring the sweep gas. This gives a measure of the Staged Recovery Factor. The permeate gas is free to exhaust.",
        "The SRF is calculated using the following formula\u2014\n\nSRF=(Conc. Of CH4/Conc. Of CO2 in retentate)/(Conc. Of CH4/Conc. of CO2 in feed)\u00d7100",
        "Therefore the higher the SRF, the better is the efficiency of the separating means (in this case membranes.) Parameters affecting separation efficiency are discussed in Industrial Gas Separations, pp 132-134 (Schell & Houston) and Gas Purification, Membrane Permeation Processes ppl 242-1245.",
        "SSF and SRF measurements on the present example of an inorganic membrane is shown in FIG. 3.",
        "The measurements were taken under conditions of 1 atmosphere and for a relatively small tube. It is expected that the selectivity of separating CO2 from CH4 will increase when the pressure is increased. Moreover, use of longer tubes or two-three smaller tubes in series will also increase selectivity.",
        "An inorganic membrane 1 according to the invention comprises a porous ceramic support 2 and a separation layer 3, as shown in FIGS. 1a and 1b.",
        "Example 2 differs from Example 1 only in the composition of separation layer 3 provided. Common features between Example 1 and Example 2 are not described here for example 2.",
        "The separation layer 3 of the Example 2 comprises a gamma-alumina layer (not shown) mounted on the support 2, a silica layer (not shown) and a carbon molecular sieve (not shown).",
        "To form the membrane 1 of the Example 2, the support 2 is exposed to a boemite sol maintained at 0.6 mol/L (as the gamma alumina source) using the dip-coating technique as described for example 1. The support 2 is immersed into the boemite sol for approximately two minutes. The membrane is then air dried overnight and heated to between 700 and 800\u00b0 C. at a rate of 1\u00b0 C./minute. The process is normally repeated three times or more to achieve the required thickness of gamma alumina on the support 2, normally between 1-12 \u03bcm, preferably 6 \u03bcm.",
        "Once the required gamma-alumina layer thickness has been added to the support 2, a silica or carbon molecular sieve layer is then applied to form the final separating layer 3. The silica-layer is deposited over the gamma alumina by the method described above in relation to Example 1.",
        "To deposit the carbon molecular sieve layer, the alumina/silica coated support 2 is dipped in a polyetherimide solution of between 1 and 5 moll\u22121, preferably 3 moll\u22121. The support 2 is then dried in air.",
        "Carbonisation is performed in an argon atmosphere using a predefined temperature profile. In this example, the support was heated from 20-80\u00b0 C. for 2 hours and then from 80-120\u00b0 C. for 4 hours although a variety of temperature profiles may be suitably employed. Such a process may be repeated as necessary to achieve the required CO2/CH4 selectivity and CO2 permeability.",
        "An inorganic membrane 1 according to the invention comprises a porous ceramic support 2 and a separation layer 3, as shown in FIGS. 1a and 1b.",
        "Example 3 differs from Example 1 only in the composition of separation layer 3 provided. Common features between Example 1 and Example 3 are not described here for Example 3.",
        "The separation layer of Example 3 does not comprise a silica layer in contrast to the previous Examples 1 and 2. A layer of gamma-alumina is added directly onto the support 2 as detailed for Example 2.",
        "The support 2 is then chemically modified by impregnating its surface using magnesium nitrate, Mg(NO3)2. Mg(NO3)2 reduces to form magnesium oxide MgO which is thus located in the pores of the separating layer so that the surface concentration is 4 mmols Mg per square metre.",
        "The chemical affinity between the magnesium oxide and the carbon dioxide increases the selectivity of the membrane 1.",
        "The ceramic nature of the inorganic membrane 1 may be used at high temperatures and pressures and in extreme conditions, for example downhole. Moreover, the ceramic materials are resistant to acidic degradation; acids such as carbonic acids being commonly formed thereabouts by the combination of CO2 and H2O. Therefore, embodiments of the invention can be used to separate mixtures of \u2018wet\u2019 gases which would degrade other separating means.",
        "Ceramic materials also have a high mechanical strength.",
        "Embodiments of the invention used downhole have the advantage that acidic gases are removed before transfer by pipeline thereby reducing the corrosion of the pipeline caused by such acidic gases.",
        "The passage of CO2 through the membrane 1 enables continuous production of a relatively pure methane at high pressure making the process extremely cost effective.",
        "Most territories impose restrictions on releasing the environmentally damaging CO2 to the atmosphere and so certain embodiments of the present invention provide a means to remove this gas from natural gas before flaring.",
        "The apparatus according to the present invention may also be used in exhaust stacks to remove, for example, CO2 from exhaust fumes. For example, the impure methane produced from landfill sites may be purified on site and then used as a fuel.",
        "The hybrid structures may be characterised by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen absorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, BET surface analysis and EDAX surface elemental analysis. SEM photographs are shown in FIGS. 6a and 6b at 2500 and 1000 times magnification respectively.",
        "Embodiments of the invention may be used to separate other gaseous or fluid mixtures, e.g. N2 or H2S may be separated from raw natural gas at mildly high temperatures of \u02dc50-100\u00b0 C. This is permitted by the relative molecular dimensions of CH4, N2, CO2, H2O and H2S which are summarised in the table below",
        "Molecule\nSize \u212b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCH4\n3.8\n\n\n\nCO2\n3.3\n\n\n\nN2\n3.6\n\n\n\nH2O\n2.7\n\n\n\nH2S\n3.6\n\n\n\n(Membrane)\n3.6-3.7 A",
        "Thus, even though CH4 is lighter than the other molecules and so would be expected to penetrate the membrane more readily than the heavier molecules, it has been found that membranes according to the invention allow passage of the heavier molecules while restricting passage of the lighter methane molecules.",
        "Preferably, the selectivity of CO2/CH4 is 150 at 350\u00b0 C.; that is 150 CO2 molecules will travel through the membrane for each CH4 molecule that travels through the membrane. Preferably, the selectivity of CO2/N2 is 120 at 350\u00b0 C. Preferably, the permeability of CO2 through the membrane 1 is >4\u00d710\u22127 mol/m2sPa at 350\u00b0 C. Preferably, the durability of the inorganic membrane 1 is greater than 500 hours at 350\u00b0 C. in corrosive environments.",
        "An advantage of using ceramic membranes to purify natural gas is their durability. Absorbent performance of known separating means generally decrease with their age whereas the absorbent performance of ceramic materials do not decrease with age. Embodiments including a silica layer are particularly durable.",
        "Further advantages of the use of ceramics in such applications may include enhanced plant performance and a reduction in energy consumption. Ceramic materials may also be used for mixtures with high CO2 concentrations for example, ranging from 3% to 72% CO2.",
        "Improvements and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention."
