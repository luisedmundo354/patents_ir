    "abstract": "A remote controller apparatus has a controller body, which is provided with annularly disposed display devices displaying as images operating buttons for the purpose of executing functions of a remotely controlled apparatus, and which is further provided with a display device at the center of the annularly disposed display devices. Operating switches are provided below each of the display devices, a transparent shuttle ring is disposed over the annularly disposed display devices, and a transparent center button is provided over the display device at the center. The shuttle ring is caused to rotate, and if necessary operating buttons displayed by each of the display devices are switched to other operating buttons. By doing this, it is possible to assign images of various operating buttons for executing functions of a remotely controlled apparatus to the display devices of the remote controller apparatus, which display this operating buttons, and also possible for a user to operate operating buttons without being aware of which operating buttons correspond to which operations. Additionally, the need to assign more than one operation to one button is eliminated, and it is possible to avoid an excessive increase in the number of operating buttons.",

        "This application is related to Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-370262 filed on Dec. 4, 2001, based on which this application claims priority under the Paris Convention and the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a controller apparatus, an electrical apparatus, a remote control system, an image display method, and a computer readable recording medium onto which an image display program to be executed by a computer is recorded, for remotely controlling a piece of equipment such as a DVD player, a video recorder, or a TV tuner or the like.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "A remote controller apparatus for remotely controlling apparatuses such as a television receiver and a video recorder, or a game controller for operating a video game machine is designed as a one-way communication apparatus having a variety of operating buttons suited to these apparatuses or a game controller.",
        "These operating buttons are usually uniquely linked to specific operations of the apparatus being controlled. For example, in the case of a playback button, only a playback function would be assigned to the button. There are other cases in which a plurality of functions (operations) is assigned to one operating button. For example, depending upon the application program for a game or the like, there are cases in which key assignments can be freely changed, thereby enabling one operating button to have a number of operations.",
        "However, if characters or symbols for only one operation are marked on an operating button, it is necessary for a user to constantly be aware of what operation is assigned to each operating button, thereby leading to considerable confusion on the part of the user.",
        "Another approach is that of reducing the number of operations assigned to one operating button and increasing the number of operating buttons. The resulting increase in the number of operating buttons, however, makes operation not easier, but actually more difficult.",
        "Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a controller apparatus, an electrical apparatus, a remote control system, an image display method, and a computer readable recording medium onto which an image display program to be executed by a computer is recorded, capable of bi-directional communication, and which cause the display of operating buttons in accordance with the apparatus being operated or an application program, thereby enabling the user to easily operate various operating buttons, while limiting the increase in the number of operating buttons, and enabling operating with a small number of operating buttons.",
        "A controller apparatus according to the present invention has one or more display units each of which displays an image relating to a function executable on at least one of the controller apparatus and the electronic apparatus, a manipulatable unit that outputs a signal corresponding to the image in accordance with a manipulation operation, and a communication unit that transmits the signal to the electronic apparatus and receives from the electronic apparatus a function setting data for enabling execution of a function of at least one of the controller apparatus and the electronic apparatus.",
        "The image data defined in the present invention can be an icon or other mark or illustration, and can further be characters such as a numeral or a letter.",
        "The above and other features of the present invention will be better understood from the exemplary embodiments described below, taken together with the drawings, of which:",

        "As shown in FIG. 5, display numbers are assigned to the display devices 5a to 5q, these corresponding to the positions thereof. The center display device 5a has the display number 00 assigned thereto, and the display devices 5b to 5q have the numbers 01, 02, 03, . . . , and 16 assigned to them, starting from the uppermost position (the \u201c12 o'clock\u201d position) of the drawing.",
        "On the display device 5a disposed at the center, a graphic or characters for selection of the type of the apparatus 2 or selection of the apparatus 2 is displayed. Examples are display of the characters DVD, BS TV, and VIDEO, respectively, for a DVD player, a BS TV tuner, and a video tape recorder, and the display of an image of a mobile phone for the case of a mobile phone terminal apparatus that is connectable to the Internet. Characters such as \u201cSOURCE SELECT\u201d are displayed to indicate selection of the apparatus 2. It will be understood that these are merely examples, and that in addition to graphics and characters indicating the type of the apparatus 2 or the selection of the apparatus 2, it is possible to display graphics or characters indicating the operating mode of the apparatus 2.",
        "Graphics or characters indicating the operating mode, for example, of the apparatus 2 are displayed at the annularly disposed display devices 5b to 5q. One example is that in which, for the case of a BS TV tuner, the display devices 5b to 5q display numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . , and 12 to indicate channels. Another example is one in which, for a DVD player, the display devices 5b to 5q display graphics indicating such operations as fast-forward, rewind, stop, and pause or the like. The display devices 5b to 5q can also display graphics or characters to indicate the type of the apparatus 2.",
        "The operating switches 6a to 6q, as shown in FIG. 4, are respectively disposed below the display devices 5a to 5q. These operating switches 6a to 6q are switched on and off when the shuttle ring 7 or the center button 8, to be described below, is pressed.",
        "The shuttle ring 7, as shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, is a transparent ring disposed above the annularly disposed display devices 5b to 5q. The shuttle ring 7, as shown by the arrow I in FIG. 3, can be rotated freely relative to the controller body 4. Because the shuttle ring 7 is transparent, it is possible to view therethrough graphics and characters or the like displayed by the display devices 5b to 5q disposed therebelow. If the shuttle ring 7 is rotated to the left or to the right, switching is made, for example, to a mode that selects an apparatus 2 such as a video tape recorder, a CD player, or a DVD player or the like, whereupon graphics or characters corresponding to that mode are displayed by the display devices 5a to 5q.",
        "In this manner, by disposing the display devices 5b to 5q below the transparent shuttle ring 7, even in the case, for example, in which the shuttle ring 7 is rotated to the right, as shown by the arrow II in FIG. 8A, there is no change in the positions of the operating buttons (graphic displays serving as operating buttons) displayed by the display devices 5b to 5q disposed therebelow. If the display devices 5b to 5q are located on the surface of the shuttle ring 7, however, as shown in FIG. 9A and FIG. 9B, rotation of the shuttle ring 7 causes a change in the orientation of the operating buttons, making operating difficult. Although in the example shown in FIG. 8A and FIG. 8B, the operating buttons displayed by the display devices 5b to 5q are always displayed by the same display devices 5b to 5q, as shown in FIG. 10A and FIG. 10B, it is alternatively possible to cause the display positions of the operating button to rotate in accordance with rotation of the shuttle ring 7, in which case because the orientation of the operating buttons remains the same, there is no hindrance to operation.",
        "The shuttle ring 7 is configured so as to stop at positions in accordance with intervals between the positions at which the display devices 5a to 5q are disposed, and provide a tactile detent click at these positions. It will be understood that the shuttle ring 7 can alternatively be configured so as to rotate smoothly with no such detents.",

When the rotational movement amount detector 66 detects rotation of the shuttle ring 7, part of the content displayed by the annularly disposed display devices 5b to 5q is switched so as to be displayed by the center display device 5a, responsive to the rotation of the shuttle ring 7.",
        "Although the shuttle ring 7 can be made of a hard, transparent plastic material, it can also be formed as a soft, resilient, transparent resin member, in which case it is particularly easy to press the operating switches 6a to 6q, to be described below.",
        "The center button 8, as shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, is a transparent disc-shaped button, disposed above the display device 5a, which is disposed at the center. The center button 8 is provided facing a center hole 13 of the shuttle ring 7 and, in contrast to the shuttle ring 7, is mounted to the controller body 4 so as to not be rotatable. This center button 8, similar to the shuttle ring 7, is formed as a hard, transparent plastic or resilient, transparent resin member. If the center button 8 is formed as a soft resin member, it is easy to press the center button 8.",
        "The transmitting/receiving section 10 can perform uni-directional or bi-directional communication so as exchange signals between the remote controller apparatus 1 and the apparatus 2. For example, in the case in which uni-directional communication is done from the controller body 4 to the apparatus 2, remote control signals output by pressing the operating buttons displayed by the display devices 5a to 5q are sent to the apparatus 2 from the transmitting/receiving section 10 of the remote controller apparatus 1.
