        "The emulsions are generally stabilized by incorporation of emulsifying surfactants of the oil-in-water (O/W) or water-in-oil (W/O) type which by virtue of their amphiphilic structure are located at the oil/water interface and so stabilize the dispersed droplets. It is generally necessary to add these surfactants in a considerable amount\u2014up to 10% by weight with regard to the overall weight of the emulsion\u2014in order to obtain an appropriate stability.",
        "These amphiphilic surfactants used in large quantity, however, may trigger an irritant effect toward the skin, eyes and/or scalp of the user. Furthermore, their use at high concentrations may lead to cosmetically unwanted effects, such as a rough, sticky and/or viscous sensation, and may give rise to a compact, heavy substance. Furthermore, the surfactants have to be selected as a function of the polarity of the oils and are therefore compatible only with a limited number of oils, thereby acryloyidimethyltaurate-based thickener systems display outstanding properties in pH ranges below pH 6.0, i.e., within a pH range in which it is no longer possible to operate with conventional poly(meth)acrylate thickeners.",
        "A disadvantage of these acryloyldimethyltaurate-based thickener systems, however, is that stable emulsions are generally only achievable in the presence of additional surfactant coemulsifiers.",

        "Essential to the invention is that the described acryloyldimethyltaurate copolymers can be used even in the absence of an additional nonsurfactant coemulsifier (e.g., polymeric emulsifiers) and/or in the absence of an additional bodying agent. The presence of nonsurfactant coemulsifiers and/or bodying agents is therefore not mandatory, though is possible. Combination with other known nonsurfactant coemulsifiers and/or bodying agents may be desirable in order to set specific cosmetic profiles and to exploit synergistic effects.",
        "The qualities achieved are extremely innovative: the emulsions are creamy and ointmentlike and above all do not have the gellike or even gelatinelike appearance of certain prior art emulsions in which the external aqueous phase is thickened. The cosmetic feel on the skin is also very good. Upon application the emulsion imparts a sensation of freshness and of comfort, and at the same time has a rich and nourishing effect; it is soft and luxurious and in no way sticky. Emulsions of the invention can be prepared in a conventional manner, by hot, hot-hot/cold, or PIT emulsification, for example.",
        "The examples which follow are intended to illustrate the invention, though without restricting it thereto (the percentages are by weight). The copolymers used in the examples are representatives of the particularly preferred copolymers 1 to 67 already listed in the description. They were prepared by the therein-indicated processes 1, 2, 3 or 4 using the preferred initiators and solvents.",
