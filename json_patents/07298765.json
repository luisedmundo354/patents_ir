    "abstract": "A system and a method are provided for multiplexing digital and analog signals to and from a device using a single electrical connector. The system includes a connector with at least four lines and analog and digital interfaces attached to the connector. The interfaces share: first and second analog-to-digital converters (ADCs); and first, second, and third switches. The analog interface includes an audio sub-system with a third ADC and first, second, and third digital-to-analog converters (DACs). The digital interface includes a digital sub-system. The switches have first terminals attached to the connector, second terminals connected to the third ADC and the DACs. The switches open in response to a digital mode signal, enabling a digital signal path from the digital interface terminals to the connector. The switches close in response to an analog mode signal, enabling an analog signal path from the connector to the audio sub-system.",

        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Connectors are used to interface devices for the purpose of communicating signals or power. These signals can include digital data signals and analog signals. The following discussion is directed to audio analog signals. However, the discussion applies to other types of analog signals as well. Typically, connectors are configured to accept one particular type of connector interface, for example, a jack. As is well known, there are a large variety of cable types and associated connector interfaces. Typically, each particular type of connector interface is configured to handle only one specific type of signal. For example, wireless communications devices may use a connector accepting a four-line jack for a headset. The lines from the jack supply an audio input signal from a microphone in the headset, accept an audio output signal for a mono speaker in the headset or audio output signals for stereo speakers in the headset, and ground the headset to the device. The connector for the headset jack does not accept other types of cable connectors. For example, a separate connector, incompatible with the headset jack, is used to send and receive digital signals through an alternate port. In addition, separate sub-systems are typically used in a wireless communications device to supply and accept different types of signals to and from a connector in the device. The sub-systems may have different operating parameters and sensitivities and are typically not designed to handle other types of signals. For example, voltages associated with an audio signal could damage digital data signal circuits. Therefore, using separate, incompatible connectors in a wireless device serves the purpose of protecting circuitry in the device from the inadvertent application of potentially damaging signals to the circuitry. For example, as noted above, a user cannot inadvertently insert the headset jack into a digital data connector.",
        "Therefore, it is known to use separate connectors to accept and supply digital and analog signals. However, there are disadvantages associated with the use of separate connectors for different signal types. A wireless communications device is used as an example to illustrate these disadvantages. However, it should be appreciated that these disadvantages apply to other portable devices and non-portable devices as well. Advances in technology and manufacturing techniques permit wireless communications devices to be made increasingly smaller, which in turn, creates a need to reduce the space required for components in the devices by reducing the number and/or size of the components.",
        "Unfortunately, providing separate connectors increases the component parts count in a wireless device. The subsequent increase in space usage can limit the size to which a wireless device can be reduced, or can limit space available in the wireless device for other components. Increasing the parts count for a wireless device also adds to the cost of producing the wireless device. Since general reliability decreases as parts count in a wireless device increases, increasing the parts count by using separate connectors also decreases the reliability of the wireless device.",
        "It would be advantageous if the number of connectors used in a device to accept and supply digital and analog communication signals could be reduced.",
        "The present invention addresses connectors in a device used to accept and supply communication signals. The invention recognizes that space and costs for components are concerns in the manufacture of most devices, particularly portable devices, such as wireless communications devices. The invention also recognizes that reduced reliability associated with increased component parts count in a device is a concern. The invention addresses these problems by using a single connector to supply and accept digital and analog signals, thereby reducing component parts count and associated space, cost, and reliability concerns.",
        "Accordingly, a system is presented for multiplexing digital and analog signals to and from a device using a single electrical connector. The system includes a connector with at least four lines and analog and digital interfaces attached to the connector. The interfaces supply communication signals to, and accept communication signals from the connector. The interfaces share: first and second analog-to-digital converters (ADCs); first, second, and third switches; and a controller to supply mode signals. The analog interface includes an audio sub-system with a third ADC and first, second, and third digital-to-analog converters (DACs). The digital interface includes a digital sub-system. The switches have first terminals attached to the connector, second terminals connected to the third ADC and the DACs, and inputs to accept the mode signals. The switches open in response to a digital mode signal, enabling a digital signal path from the digital interface terminals to the connector. The switches close in response to an analog mode signal, enabling an audio signal path from the connector to the third ADC and the DACs.",

The system 100 in FIG. 1 is configured for a USB digital mode. However, it should be appreciated that the present invention is applicable to other digital communication modes, particularly Recommended Standard\u2212232 (RS-232), as described below. The system 100 is applicable to a device 102 and includes a connector with at least four lines. In FIG. 1, a four-line connector 104 is used as an example. Connector 104 accepts a four-wire jack (not shown).

As noted in the above Background Section, device connectors typically accept and supply one particular type of communication signal. In the system 100, however, the connector 104 accepts both digital and analog communication signals. That is, the system 100 can operate in a digital mode or an analog mode. A wireless communications device is used as an example to discuss the operation of the system 100. However, it should be appreciated that the discussion of system 100 also is applicable to other portable devices and non-portable devices as well.",
        "At least two factors contribute to the system 100 capability of operating in both digital and analog modes in a wireless communications device. First, it is relatively uncommon for a wireless device to simultaneously operate in both digital and analog modes. Therefore, it is possible, in most cases, for a single connector to accommodate both digital and analog signals. Second, with care, the states required for USB and RS-232 digital signals to provide the information needed by devices receiving the digital signals can be chosen to match the requirements of the analog portion of a wireless device, allowing the same lines to be used for digital and analog signals. To accomplish both analog and digital communication, the system 100 includes an analog interface 106 and a digital interface 108. The analog interface 106 and the digital interface 108 share lines 110, 112, 114, and 116 to the connector 104 and these lines are used for supplying and accepting analog and digital communication signals to and from the connector 104, as further described below.

That is, the detection sub-systems 118 and 121 detect and identify the communication signals without input or instructions from the device 102 user or reconfiguration of the system 100. The detection sub-system information is used by the system 100 to automatically switch operations between digital and analog modes as described below. The detection sub-system 118 includes a first analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 123 connected to the detection sub-system 118 input on line 110. The detection sub-system 121 includes a second ADC 124 connected to the detection sub-system 121 input on line 116.

However, the pull-up resistor on line 112 may not be desirable for high-speed data transfer operations. These resistors can add functionality in some specific circumstances.

The following are examples of detecting analog voltage. In the stereo audio mode, a speaker attached to line 116 via the connector 104 typically has low resistance, which the ADC 124 detects as a near ground voltage. In response, the ADC 124 supplies a stereo audio identification signal on line 122. When line 116 is grounded, as described above for the mono audio mode, the ADC 124 detects ground voltage. In response, the ADC 124 supplies a mono audio identification signal on line 122.",

Other devices attached to line 116 could result in the ADC 124 detecting voltages between the near ground and the applied power voltage levels. In these cases, the ADC 124 could be calibrated to supply identification signals corresponding to the other devices. If the bias circuit 150 is not included in the detection circuit 121, the varying resistances to ground with respect to line 116, associated with devices attached to line 116, could be used to identify these devices.
