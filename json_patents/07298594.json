        "The present invention relates to laminated magnetoresistance devices containing a ferromagnetic layer, nonmagnetic layer, ferromagnetic layer and to electronic devices using these magnetoresistance devices.",
        "The magnetoresistance effect is generally a physical phenomenon wherein a magnetic field is applied to a magnetic material to vary the electrical resistance. The GMR device that utilizes the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect discovered in metallic multilayer film structures comprised of laminations of ferromagnetic metal layers/nonmagnetic metal layers/ferromagnetic metal layers is already utilized in magnetic read-out heads. In recent years, the application of magnetic random access memory (MRAM) devices as nonvolatile memories is under study. However, due to the tremendous advances made in magnetic recording density, utilizing magnetoresistance devices in next generation magnetic heads and large capacity MRAM requires making the magnetoresistance ratio (MR ratio) even larger, and making further increases in the sensitivity response to external magnetic fields.",
        "In recent years, magnetoresistance devices (tunneling magneto-resistance devices: TMR devices) that utilize the tunnel current flowing between both ferromagnetic layers have been discovered. In other words, these TMR devices use the tunnel current that flows when a tunnel junction with an insulating layer is inserted between two ferromagnetic layers namely, a ferromagnetic tunnel junction. The magnetoresistance ratio in these ferromagnetic tunnel junction devices exceeds 20 percent (Non-patent Document 1) so there is increasing potential for applications in magnetic heads and magnetoresistance effect memories. The magnetoresistance ratio at room temperature is approximately 40 percent; however an even larger magnetoresistance ratio is needed in order to obtain the output voltage needed for magnetic read-out heads of high density magnetic recording medium.",
        "In MRAM applications using TMR devices, an external magnetic field (an electromagnetic field) is applied to ferromagnetic layer without a fixed magnetic direction (freely magnetized layer) by making an electrical current flow in the external wiring to reverse the magnetic direction of the free layer of magnetization. However, the constantly shrinking size of the memory cell brings about an increase in the magnetic field (magnetic switching field) required for magnetic reversal of the freely magnetized layer that causes an unavoidable increase in the wiring current for writing. Therefore, increasing the capacity of the MRAM causes an unavoidable increase in electrical power consumption. The increased electrical current in the wiring brings the potential problem of the wiring melting. One method for resolving this problem is to cause a magnetic reversal by injecting a spin-polarized spin current (Non-patent Document 2). However, this method for inducing a magnetic reversal by injecting a spin current, increases the electrical current density flowing in the TMR device. This increase in electrical current density might possibly cause the wiring to deteriorate or induce a ferroelectric breakdown in the tunnel insulation (dielectric) due to electro-migration.",
        "In recent years, on the other hand, much attention has been focused on new magnetic material capable of being utilized in magnetoresistive devices. These are diluted magnetic semiconductors such as type III-IV semiconductors typically of GaAs, InAs or type IV semiconductors of germanium, substituted in part with the magnetic atom manganese. In particular, structures of field effect transistors (FET) fabricated using a magnetic semiconductor as the substrate are capable of inducing a magnetic phase transition from a non-magnetic phase to a ferromagnetic phase by applying an external voltage from the gate electrode to the internal portion of the magnetic semiconductor substrate (Non-patent Document 3).",
        "This electric field-induced magnetic phase transition is caused by the fact that the ferromagnetic transition temperature of the magnetic semiconductor is strongly dependent on the carrier (hole) concentration. The above FET device is an innovative device that utilizes this physical effect to cause shifts in the bulk magnetic state (ferromagnetic state/non-magnetic state) even under fixed temperature conditions, by effectively injecting (doping) carriers the semiconductor internally by applying an electrical field externally. Besides diluted magnetic semiconductors, another material known to be capable of this type of electric field-induced magnetic phase transition is manganese oxides having a perovskite crystalline structure. However, the internal magnetic semiconductor substrate of this FET is not comprised of a ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic/ferromagnetic junction structure, and so no improvement in the MR ratio can be expected even in the vicinity of the magnetic phase transition. This FET structure is therefore not suited for use as a magnetoresistive device.",
        "The diluted magnetic semiconductors are predicted to be a half metal (spin polarization of the fermi surface equals 100%) by an elaborate calculation of electronic states. Based on this prediction, the laminated magnetoresistive device with a nonmagnetic semiconductor layer inserted between the magnetic semiconductor layers is expected to have an MR ratio in excess of 100%. Even though, trial fabrication of ferromagnetic junction type magnetoresistive devices using magnetic semiconductor has also begun very recently, a magnetoresistive device having an MR ratio in excess of 40 percent at room temperature has not been achieved.",

        "The magnetoresistive device of the related art typically contains a three-layer laminated heterogeneous junction structure comprised of a ferromagnetic layer, nonmagnetic layer, and ferromagnetic layer. However fabricating a satisfactory heterogeneous interface/junction and a uniformly thin intermediate layer is extremely difficult. Microscopic irregularities at the crystal boundaries of the heterogeneous junction and the effects of microscopic pin holes formed unintentionally in the nonmagnetic intermediate layer create the problem that the MR ratio of the magnetoresistance device drastically deteriorates from the theoretically expected value. Further, the MR ratio in the magnetoresistive device, varies according to the film thickness of the nonmagnetic intermediate layer so that obtaining a large improvement in the MR ratio and optimizing with the peripheral circuits could only be achieved by experimentally fabricating large numbers of devices with nonmagnetic layers of different film thickness.",
        "In order to resolve the above problems with the related art, a first object of the present invention is to provide an optimized, electrically-controlled magnetoresistance device, further having an improved MR ratio only by using the field effect in FET structures using magnetic materials (for example, diluted magnetic semiconductor) capable of electric-field type of carrier-doping of the substrate, and further provide magnetic sensors of different types or high sensitivity magnetic heads for high density magnetic recording medium utilizing these magnetoresistive devices. A second object of the present invention is to provide an MRAM device having low power consumption and an adequate output signal by utilizing a field effect magnetoresistive device as the means for writing the MRAM memory cells.",
        "The magnetoresistance device utilizing the field effect of the present invention is a device containing a substrate capable of being doped with carriers (holes) in an electric field, wherein a patterned dielectric (insulating) layer is laminated in a flat shape on this substrate and by forming an FET structure with gate electrodes on that dielectric layer, a non-uniform spatially modulated electrical field is applied to the substrate. This field effect is essentially characterized by inducing a strongly electric-doped domain (first ferromagnetic domain), a weakly doped domain (nonmagnetic domain), and a strongly doped electrical field domain (second ferromagnetic domain).",

        "The field effect spin-controlled device of the present invention is characterized essentially in actively controlling the direction of magnetization of the first through the second ferromagnetic domains in magnetoresistive devices with the above described structure by utilizing the electric field effect. Here, the magnetic exchange interaction between both ferromagnetic domains inducing positive and negative oscillations as a function of the particular voltage, is utilized based on the RKKY (Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida) mechanism or quantum well mechanism functioning via the intermediate nonmagnetic domain in both the ferromagnetic domains. The present invention therefore provides a technology for magnetic reversals by electric field carrier doping.",
        "The above described device utilizes the same material in the substrate and therefore has the advantages of no crystal irregularities or defects in the magnetic junction boundary effective in inducing the field effect. In the device structure of the present invention, the MR ratio can be controlled and optimized just by applying a voltage from the gate electrode. Another advantage is that the power consumption required for device operation can be significantly lowered by utilizing the electrical field effect. Further, utilizing a magnetic semiconductor in the substrate will provide good compatibility with conventional semiconductor manufacturing process technology and make integration with peripheral semiconductor circuits simpler.",

A first metallic electrode (gate electrode) 13 is formed on the insulating (film) layer 12. When an external section applies a positive voltage of Vg>0 to the gate electrode 13 from the power supply 17, a strong electrical field is applied locally to the substrate directly below the region where the insulating film layer is thin and that part of the substrate can be doped with a high concentration of hole carriers (doped region with high concentration of carriers is formed). On the other hand, when a weak electrical field is applied to the region on the substrate directly below region where the insulating film is thick, then that part of the substrate can be doped with a low concentration of hole carriers (doped region with a low concentration of carriers is formed).",

Setting the voltage Vg as needed in this structure, allows a transition in the nonmagnetic substrate 11 to a highly concentrated doped region in ferromagnetic domain 111 and 113, and into the low concentrated doped region of nonmagnetic domain 112. The electrical field has no actual effect here on both ends 110 so this is a nonmagnetic domain which is the original nonmagnetic substrate 11.",
        "When the intermediate nonmagnetic domain 112 within the junction structure comprised of the ferromagnetic domain 111/nonmagnetic domain 112/ferromagnetic domain 113 and patterned in a flat shape, conducts like a metal, then it effectively functions as a GMR (giant magnetoresistance) device. When the intermediate nonmagnetic domain 112 conducts like a dielectric or a semiconductor, then it effectively functions as a TMR (tunneling magnetoresistance) device. The electromagnetic resistance R(H) of the field effect magnetoresistance device of the present invention can by obtained by measuring the electrical resistance as a function of the external magnetic field H, when a power supply 16 is connected across a second metal electrode (source electrode) 14 and a third electrode (drain electrode) 15 formed on the upper part of both ends of substrate 11 and an electrical current made to flow.",
        "An overview of the process for fabricating the three-terminal FET structure of the first embodiment is described next. The three-terminal FET structure of the first embodiment was fabricated by a process identical to that in semiconductor processing technology used for manufacturing MOS-FET devices.",
        "A support substrate for forming the three-terminal FET structure is first of all prepared. This support substrate is for example a silicon substrate of a specified thickness. A magnetic semiconductor piece MnxGe1\u2212x (X=0.04) capable of being doped with electric field carriers is used as the substrate 11. The substrate 11 is formed on this support substrate. An insulating alumina layer (Al2O3) is then deposited by sputtering or molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to a uniform film thickness of 5 nanometers on the upper surface of the substrate 11 to form an electrical insulating film 12. The alumina layer here is formed by the natural oxidation method or plasma oxidization method after first forming an aluminum-atom layer by evaporation deposition. Further, a convex structure (convex portion width of 20 nm) is then formed by removing a film thickness of 3 nanometers from both sides of the insulating film 12 by a chemical etching method. Next a gate electrode (Au) 13, a source electrode (Au) 14 and a drain electrode (Au) 15 are evaporation deposited. An insulating layer is then formed as a protective layer and connections made to each electrode after forming the required wiring.",

Diluted magnetic semiconductor may for example be type III-V semiconductors such as GaAs, InAs atoms, or type IV semiconductors such as silicon or germanium with a portion of their atoms substituted by magnetic atoms such as manganese. Magnetic semiconductors doped with manganese atoms may be utilized in wide gap semiconductors such as GaN and ZnO. Besides magnetic semiconductors, perovskite crystal structures made up of manganese oxides or GaAs/MnSb granular structures may also be used. The insulating material need not only be alumina, and any material may be used as the insulating material if it has a high ferroelectric constant and does not cause destruction of the insulation when a gate voltage Vg is applied during device operation. Such insulating materials include Si3N4, SiO, and MgO.",
        "The process described here may also be applied in the same way to the second embodiment and the third embodiment.",
        "The FET structure of the field effect magnetoresistance device of the first embodiment can also be achieved with a ferromagnetic substrate capable of being electric carrier doped rather than by a non-magnetic substrate capable of being doped with electrical field carriers.

Comparing FIG. 2A with FIG. 1A clearly shows that an electric field carrier dopable ferromagnetic substrate 21 is utilized instead of the electric field carrier dopable nonmagnetic substrate 11. This comparison also shows that a concave shape has been substituted for the convex shape of the electrical insulating film 12 pattern formed on the field carrier dopable ferromagnetic substrate 21. Further, a reverse bias voltage (negative voltage) Vg<0, has been applied to the gate electrode 13 instead of the positive voltage Vg>0.",

The present field effect magnetoresistance device operates by sensing the magnetoresistance across the source and drain electrodes of the FET structure, the same as with a typical magnetic head and magnetic sensor. The most significant feature of the device of the present invention is that the MR ratio and the write sensitivity are optimized by setting an optimal gate voltage Vg value. Also clearly apparent is that the power consumption accompanying the field effect does not occur as the leak current from the gate electrode can be ignored. Also, even if an electrical field leakage occurs from the FET structure, the present device has the benefit that the electrical field leakage itself will not alter the magnetism of the section used for magnetic sensing.",
        "The basic structure and the operating principle of the field effect spin-controlled device of the fourth embodiment is described next while referring to FIG. 5.",
        "FIG. 5 is a cross sectional view of the field effect spin-controlled device of the fourth embodiment. Here, the structure of the substrate 11, insulating layer 12, gate electrode 13 and the gate electrode 14 for applying a gate voltage Vg is the same structure as the field effect magnetoresistance device of the first embodiment. In the fourth embodiment, the antiferromagnetic layer 34 is formed on the surface opposite the surface formed by the gate electrode 13 of substrate 11 at a position matching the left half of the gate electrode 13. The presence of the antiferromagnetic layer 34 fixes (pins) the magnetic orientation (spin) of the first ferromagnetic domain (left side of substrate 11 in drawing) induced when the gate voltage Vg is applied to the gate electrode 13. The first ferromagnetic domain therefore becomes a fixed magnetized layer. This fixed magnetized layer is indicated in FIG. 5 by the thick black arrow on the left side of the substrate 11. However, the magnetism (spin) of the second ferromagnetic domain (right side of substrate 11 in drawing) is not fixed, and the second ferromagnetic domain layer becomes a freely magnetized layer. This freely magnetized layer is indicated in FIG. 5 by the thick arrows with the solid line and or broken lines on the right side of the substrate 11.",
        "The effective width of the nonmagnetic domain narrows as the gate voltage Vg increases so the magnetic exchange interaction J between the first ferromagnetic domain and the second ferromagnetic domain as a function of the gate voltage Vg is expressed by the positive and negative swings (oscillation) with a shape such as shown in FIG. 6. In the conventional GMR device comprised of laminations of a ferromagnetic metal layer/nonmagnetic layer/ferromagnetic metal layers, the magnetic exchange interaction J that acts across both ferromagnetic layers is known to have positive/negative swings (oscillations) that are a function of the increasing film thickness of the nonmagnetic layer. This same effect of this phenomenon can be achieved in the field effect spin-controlled device of the fourth embodiment by controlling the gate voltage Vg. This phenomenon is physically explained by the interaction effect of the RKKY mechanism or the quantum well mechanism.",
        "From the above description, with a gate voltage Vg value (3 volts in the example in FIG. 6) for the magnetic exchange interaction J>0, the freely magnetized layer has a spin position parallel to the magnetic direction of the fixed magnetic layer (solid line arrow in FIG. 5). On the other hand, with a gate voltage Vg for the magnetic exchange interaction J<0, (5 volts in the example in FIG. 6) the freely magnetized layer has a spin position that is antiparallel to the magnetization (arrow with broken line in FIG. 5) of the fixed magnetized layer. Therefore the magnetization of the second ferromagnetic domain can be set as needed by controlling the gate voltage Vg.",
        "This magnetic reversal phenomenon of the fourth embodiment can be easily confirmed by an observation means such as spin SEM (spin-polarized scanning electron microscopy) and MFM (magnetic force microscopy).",
        "An overview of the process for fabricating the field effect spin-controlled device of the fourth embodiment is described next. The spin-controlled device is fabricated by a process identical to that in the first embodiment in semiconductor processing technology used for manufacturing MOS-FET devices.",
        "A support substrate for forming the three-terminal FET structure is first of all prepared. This support substrate is for example a silicon substrate of a specified thickness. The substrate 11 uses a magnetic semiconductor piece MnxGe1\u2212x (X=0.04) capable of being doped with electric field carriers. In the fourth embodiment, both surfaces of the substrate 11 must be processed. To perform this processing, a gate electrode (Au) 13 is first of all formed on this support substrate. A concave structure (recessed section width is 20 nanometers) is formed by stripping away three nanometers in the center structure. An insulating alumina layer (Al2O3) is then deposited by sputtering or molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to a uniform film thickness of 5 nanometers on the upper surface of the substrate 11 to form an electrical insulating film 12. The alumina layer here is formed by first depositing aluminum atoms and then using the natural oxidation method or plasma oxidization method. An electrode (gold) 14 is then formed on one side of the insulating film 12. Then, after forming the substrate 11, an antiferromagnetic layer 34 for example of MnIr alloy is formed on the upper surface of the substrate 11 at a position corresponding to the left half of the gate electrode 13. An insulating layer is then formed as a protective layer, and the required wiring formed and connections made to each electrode",
        "The substrate 11 the same as in the first embodiment, may be comprised not only by MnxGe1\u2212x, but by any materials capable of switching the magnetic\u2014nonmagnetic states by typical carrier doping.",
        "The basic structure and operating principle of the electrically-driven MRAM using the field effect spin-controlled device as described for the fourth embodiment is described next while referring to FIG. 7. Sections in FIG. 7 identical to FIG. 5 are assigned the same reference numerals. After forming the structure shown in FIG. 5, a nonvolatile memory unit 500 is formed on the side opposite the side of substrate 11 where the gate electrode 13 is formed. The nonvolatile memory unit 500 position corresponds to the position of the right half of the gate electrode 13 matching the region formed by the freely magnetized layer of substrate 11. This nonvolatile memory unit 500 is a CPP-GMR memory cell utilizing laminated films comprised from the substrate 11 side, of a nonmagnetic layer 51, a ferromagnetic metal layer 52 (freely magnetized layer)/nonmagnetic metal layer 53/ferromagnetic metal layer 54 (fixed magnetized layer). This nonvolatile memory unit 500 may also be a TMR memory cell utilizing laminated films comprised of a nonmagnetic layer 51, a ferromagnetic metal layer 52 (freely magnetized layer)/nonmagnetic metal layer 53/ferromagnetic metal layer 54 (fixed magnetized layer). The ferromagnetic metal layer 54 has a sufficient thickness versus the ferromagnetic metal layer 52 and so the ferromagnetic metal layer 54 functions as a fixed magnetized layer. The external electrodes 15 and 55 are formed to detect the storage information of the nonvolatile memory unit 500. Even when the gate voltage is off (Vg=0), the nonvolatile memory unit 500 retains the magnetic recording information formed on the freely magnetized layer of the substrate 11.",
        "The write operation (program mode) on the field effect MRAM cell of the fifth embodiment, applies a gate voltage Vg corresponding to the magnetic exchange interaction J>0 to the gate electrode 13, or applies a gate voltage Vg to the gate electrode 13 corresponding to the magnetic exchange interaction J<0 as the data for storage. The magnetization direction (position where nonvolatile memory unit 500 is installed) of the second ferromagnetic region of the substrate 11 is consequently parallel or antiparallel to the magnetization direction at the position where the antiferromagnetic layer 34 is formed within the substrate 11. The magnetization direction of the second ferromagnetic region of the substrate 11 is transferred by way of the magnetic coupling force of the nonmagnetic layer 51 to the ferromagnetic metal layer 52 which is a freely magnetized layer of the nonvolatile memory unit 500. Writing on the GMR or the TMR memory cell is performed in this way.",
        "In the read-out operation (read mode), the gate voltage Vg applied to the gate electrode 13 is off. The substrate 11 is therefore in a nonmagnetic state at this time; however the magnetic recording information (magnetized direction) formed on the substrate by the gate voltage Vg, is still retained in the nonvolatile memory unit 500. Here, sensing current flowing across the electrode 15 and electrode 55, allows performing read-out by detecting the 0 and 1 record (write) bits from changes in the resistance across the electrodes 15-55 the same as in a typical MRAM device.",
        "An overview of the process for fabricating the electrically driven MRAM cell of the fifth embodiment is described next. Here also, the electrically driven MRAM cell is fabricated by a process identical to that in the first embodiment for manufacturing MOS-FET devices.",
        "The structure shown in FIG. 5 is fabricated using the process for manufacturing the field effect spin-controlled device of the fourth embodiment. In this case, the external electrode 15 is formed along with the forming of the electrode 14. Next, the nonmagnetic layer 51 (Cu: copper) is formed to a thickness of two nanometers at a position on the substrate 11 where there is no antiferromagnetic layer 34. A laminated structure made up of the freely magnetized layer 52 (CoFe: 661 alloy of cobalt and iron) in a thickness of five nanometers, a nonmagnetic metal layer 53 (Al2O3) in a thickness of two nanometers, a fixed magnetic layer 54 (CoFe) in a thickness of 10 nanometers and further an electrode 55 (gold) are formed as the TMR device memory cell of the related art. An insulating layer is then formed as a protective layer, and the required wiring formed and connections made to each electrode.",
        "Writing is performed by setting the gate voltage to on and changing the Vg from 3 volts to a Vg of 5 volts and inverting the magnetic direction of the freely magnetized layer 506 that is the magnetic recording (write) unit. Read is performed by setting the gate voltage to off (Vg=0 volts) and fixing the magnetic direction of the write bit 0 (equivalent to a low resistance value) and 1 bit (equivalent to high resistance value) by detecting the resistance value across the electrode 505 through 509. The resistance value can also be detected by utilizing a CMOS transistor to select the memory cell position the same as with the MRAM of the related art.",
        "The size of the TMR device memory cell can be made to approximately 100 by 100 nanometers, attaining a highly integrated memory device. A GMR memory cell of the related art may be utilized instead of this TMR memory cell.",
        "FIG. 8 is a diagram showing the circuit configuration of the fixed memory when the electrically-driven MRAM cells shown in FIG. 7 are arrayed in a 2-row vertical and 2-row horizontal X-Y matrix. To write data on the electrically-driven MRAM cells, two types of voltages must be selected according to the data and then applied across the gate electrode 13 and electrode 14. To read data, a voltage applied across the electrode 15 and the electrode 55 must be applied and the current flow then detected. Since the write power supply and the read power supply should be separate, two word lines 8211, 8212 and 8221, 8222 are provided for each cell as clearly shown by referring to FIG. 7. These word line pairs are selected are each simultaneously selected by the word decoder 88. The word decoder 88 is connected by the switches 8111, 8112 and 8121, 8122 to the separate wires 861, 862. Two bit lines are connected to each electrically-driven MRAM cell. In other words, the MRAM cells are connected to the bit lines 8011, 8012 and 8021, 8022. Besides the switches 8311 and 8321 connecting to the bit lines 8011 and 8021, bit lines also respectively connect to the parallel circuit formed by the switches 8411 and 8412 as well as the parallel circuit formed by the switches 8412 and 8422. The power supply lines 851, 852 respectively connect to other end of the switches 8411 and 8421, and the other end of the switches 8412 and 8422. The voltages of the power supply lines 851, 852, are 3 volts, 5 volts on the line 862 according to the characteristics of FIG. 6. Along with the switches 8312 and 8322 connected to the bit lines 8012, 8022, the data line 853 connects to the other end of the switches 8312 and 8322. This data line 853 is set to a readout voltage by the line 861. The bit lines are respectively selected by the write bit decoder 871 and the read-out bit decoder 872. However when the switches 8311 and 8321 are turned on by the write bit decoder 871, either the switches 8411 and 8412, and either or the switches 8412 and 8421 simultaneously turns on according to the write data.",
        "The electrically-driven MRAM cell is positioned at the cross point of the word line and bit line as shown in FIG. 7. To avoid complexity, reference numerals are only assigned to the electrodes 13, 14, 15 and 55 for one cell, and the others are omitted. The electrodes 14 and 15 are shown in a shape protruding from the other layers to make the wiring easy to view. The electrode 55 of the electrically-driven MRAM cell is connected to the first word lines 8211 and 8212. The gate electrode 14 of the electrically-driven MRAM cell is connected to second word lines 8212 and 8222. The gate electrode 13 of the electrically-driven MRAM cell is connected to the first bit lines 8011 and 8021.

Patterning in a direction parallel to the paper surface is then performed for the second word line 210 (word line shown in FIG. 8 by reference numerals 8212 and 8222) according to the specified density of the memory device array. The electrically-driven MRAM cells shown in FIG. 8 are next sequentially laminated and a detailed description is omitted. In this process, the first bit line 207 connecting to the gate electrode 13 (bit line shown by reference numeral 8011 in FIG. 8) is patterned in a direction perpendicular to the paper surface.

The first word line 209 connecting to the electrode 55 is patterned in a direction perpendicular to the paper surface (word line shown in FIG. 8 by reference numerals 8211 and 8221). Each line and each element are covered by an insulating film 215 between layers.",
        "The MRAM of the related art has the unavoidable problem of large power consumption as the memory cells become more miniaturized, caused by the electrical current flowing along the wiring layer to write on the miniaturized memory cells. However, the electrically-driven MRAM cell of the present invention performs writing by selecting a gate voltage Vg so an electrically-driven MRAM cell with low power consumption can be fabricated. There is also no increase in power consumption as the cells become more miniaturized so the present invention is also ideal for large capacity MRAM.",
        "FIG. 10 is across sectional view showing another FET structure of the gate electrode 13 in the field effect magnetoresistance device of the first embodiment shown in FIG. 1A. An electrical insulating layer 12 whose structure is patterned in a convex shape is formed on the upper part of the nonmagnetic substrate 11 capable of being doped with electric field carriers. A first metallic electrode (gate electrode) 13 is formed on the insulating (film) layer 12. The other embodiments are the same as the first embodiment with the exception that the gate electrode 13 is divided into 131 and 132. An external section applies a positive voltage of Vg>0 to the gate electrode 13 from the power supply 17. A strong electrical field is applied locally to the substrate directly below the region below the gate electrodes 131 and 132. This region can be doped with a high concentration of hole carriers (forms a doped region with high carrier concentration). On the other hand, the substrate directly below the substrate 11 in sections where there are no gate electrodes 131 and 132 is indirectly affected only by a weak electrical field and that portion of the substrate can be doped with a low concentration of hole carriers (forms a doped region with a low carrier concentration).",
        "The nonmagnetic substrate 11 shown for the field effect magnetoresistance device of the first embodiment can therefore be formed with the junction structure of the ferromagnetic domain/nonmagnetic domain/ferromagnetic domain patterned in a flat shape shown in FIG. 1B. This magnetoresistance device possesses substantially the same characteristics of the field effect magnetoresistance device of the first embodiment.",
        "The field effect magnetoresistance device of the present invention outputs a sufficiently strong output signal with an MR ratio larger than the TMR device of the related art and so can therefore be used with different types of magnetic sensors and read/write heads of high density magnetic recording media. A field effect spin-controlled device is also provided that performs magnetic reversal with low electrical power consumption. By utilizing this electrically-driven magnetic reversal technology, the present invention can provide an electrically-driven MRAM with a large storage capacity and low power consumption."
