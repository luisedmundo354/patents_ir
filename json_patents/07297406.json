        "The present application is a national phase application of International Application No. PCT/JP2004/002681 filed on Mar. 3, 2004, and claims priority from such International application pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 365. In addition, the present application claims priority from Japanese Application No. 2003-059027 filed on Mar. 5, 2003. The entire disclosures of the above-identified International and Japanese applications are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "The present invention relates to a cationic electrodeposition coating composition substantially free of lead compounds, which is excellent in curability and can be finish-coated with a splendid appearance, and an article coated with the composition.",
        "Cationic electrodeposition coating compositions have been used for undercoating bodies and parts of automobiles, and required to form coating films with high corrosion resistance. The coating films need to be sufficiently cured at a predetermined baking temperature to achieve the high corrosion resistance. Dibutyltin compounds are generally used as a curing catalyst for lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating compositions. For example, dibutyltin oxide, which is usable as a catalyst for cross-linking reaction of a cationic electrodeposition coating composition, is described in JP-A-5-65438. Further, a cationic electrodeposition coating composition containing an organotin compound is disclosed in JP-A-7-258586, and a cationic electrodeposition coating composition containing a dialkyltin aromatic carboxylic acid salt as a curing catalyst is disclosed in JP-A-2001-55538.",
        "However, in general, the dibutyltin compounds are disadvantageously volatile. For example, surface temperature of electrodeposition coating films is raised to 150 to 180\u00b0 C. in a process of baking the films, coating the film with an upper film of a chipping primer, an intermediate coating, etc., or baking the upper film. The dibutyltin compounds are volatilized from the surface of the electrodeposition coating films at such a high temperature, transferred into the adjacent upper film of the chipping primer or the intermediate coating, and thereby negatively affects the film performances or appearance of the finish coating film in some cases.",
        "An object of the present invention is to provide a lead-free electrodeposition coating composition excellent in curability and a coated article, the composition being capable of forming a coating film, which emits less tin compounds to have no influence on appearance of a finish coating film and film performances.",
        "A lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention comprises a binder resin and one or more organotin compounds as a curing catalyst, wherein the binder resin comprises a cationic base resin and a crosslinking agent, the mass ratio of the organotin compounds to the solid contents of the binder resin is 0.1 to 10% by mass, and the organotin compounds comprise more than 50% by mass of a monoalkyltin compound based on the total mass of the organotin compounds.",
        "The lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention preferably comprises 100 to 2,000 ppm of zinc ions. And the cationic base resin is preferably an amino-epoxy resin. The monoalkyltin compound may be monobutyltin oxide.",
        "A coated article of the present invention comprises a substrate and an electrodeposition coating film formed thereon, which comprises the lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition. The coated article has at least a film of a chipping primer on the electrodeposition coating film in many cases. In the present invention, the excellent film performances can be achieved even in the case where the chipping primer is such that the adhesion or the appearance is negatively affected easily by transfer of tin atoms from the electrodeposition coating film.",
        "The present invention is described in detail below. In the lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention, the term \u201clead-free\u201d means that the composition substantially contains no lead (including lead in lead compounds). The detection limit of lead has been lowered year after year by advancement of analytical instruments, and in the present invention, the term \u201clead-free\u201d specifically means that the lead content of the composition is 10 ppm or less.",
        "The lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention comprises one or more organotin compounds as a curing catalyst (or a dissociation catalyst for a blocked polyisocyanate compound). The organotin compounds comprise the monoalkyltin compound. The monoalkyltin compound is particularly preferably monobutyltin oxide though there are no particular restrictions thereon. Examples of the monoalkyltin compounds include monobutyltin trioctanoate, monobutyltin triacetate, monobutyltin tribenzoate, monobutyltin trioctylate, monobutyltin trilaurate, monobutyltin trimyristate, monomethyltin triformate, monomethyltin triacetate, monomethyltin trioctylate, monooctyltin triacetate, monooctyltin trioctylate, monooctyltin trilaurate, monolauryltin triacetate, monolauryltin trioctylate, and monolauryltin trilaurate. These alkyltin compounds may be used singly or in combination of 2 or more compounds.",
        "The monoalkyltin compound may be used with other organotin compounds. Examples of the other organotin compounds include dialkyltin compounds such as dibutyltin oxide, dioctyltin oxide, dibutyltin dilaurate, and dibutyltin diacetate. In the present invention, the mass ratio of the monoalkyltin compound to the total of the organotin compounds needs to be more than 50% by mass. When the mass ratio is 50% by mass or less, the excess other organotin compounds are transferred into a film adjacent to the electrodeposition coating film to worsen the film performances and the appearance of the finish coating film. The mass ratio of the monoalkyltin compound to the total of the organotin compounds is preferably 60 to 100% by mass, more preferably 75 to 100% by mass.",
        "When the mass ratio of the organotin compounds to the solid contents of the binder resin comprising the cationic base resin and the crosslinking agent is less than 0.1% by mass, the catalytic activity is insufficient. On the other hand, when the mass ratio of the organotin compounds is increased to more than 10% by mass, the catalytic activity cannot be correspondingly improved, and further, there is a case where the electrodeposition coating film is decomposed by over baking. The mass ratio of the monoalkyltin compound to the solid contents of the binder resin comprising the cationic base resin and the crosslinking agent is preferably 0.5 to 7.0% by mass.",
        "A method for introducing the organotin compounds into the lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition is not particularly restricted. In the case where the organotin compounds are solid, the organotin compounds is preferably dispersed using a dispersing resin as well as pigments. Further, in the case where the organotin compounds are liquid, they may be dissolved in or mixed with the binder resin and introduced as a part of the binder component.",
        "The lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention may contain zinc ions. An inorganic zinc compound such as zinc oxide and zinc hydroxide or an organic zinc compound may be used to maintain the zinc ion content of the composition at the predetermined degree. The zinc compounds may be used alone or in combination of 2 or more compounds.",
        "Examples of the organic zinc compounds include zinc salts of organic mono- or di-acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, caproic acid, octylic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, behenic acid, neodecanoic acid, acrylic acid, crotonic acid, isocrotonic acid, undecylenic acid, oleic acid, erucic acid, sorbic acid, linolic acid, linolenic acid, bisphenylacetic acid, bisphenylbutyric acid, bisphenylpropionic acid, biscyclopentane carboxylic acid, bisacetoacetic acid, benzoic acid, methylbenzoic acid, bismethoxybenzoic acid, bis(tert-butyl)benzoic acid, bishydroxybenzoic acid, phthalic anhydride, terephthalic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, and fumaric acid.",
        "The zinc ion content of the lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition is preferably 100 to 2,000 ppm, more preferably 300 to 1,000 ppm. When the zinc ion content is less than 100 ppm, there is a case where the dissociation catalyst to be hereinafter described cannot show sufficient activity, resulting in insufficient curing of the electrodeposition coating film. On the other hand, when the zinc ion content is more than 2,000 ppm, appearance of the film and the electrodeposition coating workability are deteriorated in some cases.",
        "The cationic base resin used in the present invention is preferably such that the electrodeposition coating film has higher corrosion resistance. Examples of such cationic base resins include amino-epoxy resins, amino group-containing acrylic resins, amino group-containing polyester resins, etc. Among them, preferred are amino-epoxy resins. The amino-epoxy resins can be obtained that epoxy rings of an epoxy resin is opened by an amine compound such as an acid salt of a primary, secondary or tertiary amine, and cationized.",
        "The amino-epoxy resin used as a starting material for the cationic base resin may be a polyphenol-polyglycidyl ether-type epoxy resin, which is a product of a reaction between epichlorohydrin and a polycyclic phenol compound such as bisphenol A, bisphenol F, bisphenol S, phenol novolac, and cresol novolak, or a modified epoxy resin having an oxazolidone ring. The epoxy resin is preferably the modified epoxy resin having an oxazolidone ring. The modified epoxy resin can be obtained by a dealcoholization reaction of an epoxy resin with a bisurethane compound prepared by a reaction between a diisocyanate compound and one active hydrogen compound or with a heterourethane compound prepared by a reaction between a diisocyanate compound and 2 or more active hydrogen compounds. In the case of using the modified epoxy resin having an oxazolidone ring as the base resin, the electrodeposition coating film is excellent in the corrosion resistance and physical properties.",
        "The amine value of the cationic base resin is preferably 30 to 130, more preferably 40 to 80, and the number average molecular weight is preferably 1,000 to 20,000. When the amine value is less than 30, it is difficult to emulsify the cationic base resin. When the amine value is more than 130, there is a fear that the electric conductivity of the resin is increased, thereby reducing the gas pin property, reducing the Coulomb efficiency, or being disadvantageous in the electrodeposition coating workability including re-dissolubility, etc.",
        "Examples of acids for neutralizing the cationic base resin include water-soluble organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, and acrylic acid; and inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, and sulfamic acid. Among them, preferred are acetic acid, lactic acid, propionic acid, formic acid, and sulfamic acid.",
        "Blocked polyisocyanate compounds and etherified melamine resins are preferably usable as the crosslinking agent contained in the lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention. The blocked polyisocyanate compounds are such that isocyanate groups of a polyisocyanate compound are completely or partly blocked by a blocking agent. The blocking agent in the blocked polyisocyanate compound is dissociated by heating in the baking process after the electrodeposition, and the re-generated isocyanate groups are reacted with active hydrogen groups of the cationic base resin, thereby hardening the resin. The etherified melamine resins are obtained by etherifying melamine with an alcohol such as methanol and butanol. The etherified melamine resin is subjected to a transetherification with the cationic base resin to promote the crosslinking reaction in the baking process after the electrodeposition coating as the blocked polyisocyanate compound.",
        "Examples of the polyisocyanate compounds used as a material for the blocked polyisocyanate compound include aliphatic diisocyanate compounds such as trimethylene diisocyanate, tetramethylene diisocyanate, pentamethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, 1,2-propylene diisocyanate, 1,2-butylene diisocyanate, 2,3-butylene diisocyanate, 1,3-butylene diisocyanate, ethylidene diisocyanate, and butylidene diisocyanate; aliphatic, cyclic diisocyanate compounds such as 1,3-cyclopentane diisocyanate, 1,4-cyclohexane diisocyanate, 1,2-cyclohexane diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, and norbornane diisocyanate; aliphatic-aromatic isocyanate compounds such as m-phenylene diisocyanate, p-phenylene diisocyanate, 4,4\u2032-biphenyl diisocyanate, 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate, 1,4-naphthalene diisocyanate, 4,4\u2032-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 2,4- or 2,6-toluene diisocyanate or mixtures thereof, 4,4\u2032-toluidine diisocyanate, and 1,4-xylene diisocyanate; aromatic diisocyanate compounds such as dianisidine diisocyanate, 4,4\u2032-diphenyl ether diisocyanate, and chlorodiphenyl diisocyanate; triisocyanate compounds such as triphenylmethane-4,4\u2032,4\u2033-triisocyanate, 1,3,5-triisocyanate benzene, and 2,4,6-triisocyanate toluene; tetraisocyanate compounds such as 4,4\u2032-diphenyl-dimethylmethane-2,2\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetraisocyanate; and polymerized polyisocyanate compounds such as toluene diisocyanate dimer and toluene diisocyanate trimer. Among them, preferred polyisocyanate compounds are isophorone diisocyanate, norbornane diisocyanate, and 4,4\u2032-diphenylmethane diisocyanate.",
        "Examples of the blocking agents for blocking the isocyanate groups include halogenated hydrocarbons such as 1-chloro-2-propanol and ethylene chlorohydrin; aliphatic or heterocyclic alcohols such as n-propanol, furfuryl alcohol, and alkyl-substituted furfuryl alcohols; phenol compounds such as phenol, m-creosol, p-nitrophenol, p-chlorophenol, and nonylphenol; oxime compounds such as methyl ethyl ketoxime, methyl isobutyl ketone oxime, acetone oxime, and cyclohexanone oxime; active methylene compounds such as acetylacetone, ethyl acetoacetate, and diethyl malonate; aliphatic alcohols such as \u03b5-caprolactam, methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol; aromatic alcohols such as benzyl alcohol; glycol ethers such as ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, and diethylene glycol monomethyl ether; etc. Among them, preferred are methyl ethyl ketoxime and \u03b5-caprolactam.",
        "In the lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention, the solid content ratio of the cationic base resin/the crosslinking agent is preferably 50/50 to 90/10 by mass, more preferably 60/40 to 80/20 by mass. When the ratio is not within the range of 50/50 to 90/10, the curing efficiency is often insufficient.",

The amount of the organic solvent is preferably 0.1 to 10 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the solid contents of the cationic base resin and the crosslinking agent.",
        "In the present invention, though the organotin compounds containing more than 50% by mass of the monoalkyltin compound are used as the dissociation catalyst for dissociating the blocking agent, other dissociation catalysts may be used as long as they do not reduce the advantageous effects of the present invention. Examples of the other dissociation catalysts include amine compounds such as N-methylmorpholine; and salts of metals such as strontium, cobalt, and copper. The amount of the other dissociation catalyst may be 200 parts by mass or less per 100 parts by mass of the organotin compounds of the main catalyst.",
        "In addition, crosslinking resin particles, pigments, and various additives may be added to the lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention if necessary. Efficiency of maintaining the thickness of the edge portion of the coated article can be improved by adding the crosslinking resin particles. The crosslinking resin particles may be generated from an acrylic resin, an epoxy resin, a phenol resin, a melamine resin, etc. The crosslinking resin particles are particularly preferably such as using an acrylic resin from the viewpoint of production easiness.

        "The conductive substrate may comprise any material that can be electrodeposition-coated, such as iron materials, steel materials, and aluminium materials. It is preferred that the lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention is diluted with deionized water to have the solid concentration of 5 to 40% by mass, preferably 15 to 25% by mass, and the pH value of the composition is adjusted to 5.5 to 8.5, and then the composition is introduced into an electrodeposition bath, to form the electrodeposition coating film. The electrodeposition coating is preferably carried out under conditions of an electrodeposition bath temperature of 20 to 35\u00b0 C., a coating voltage of 100 to 450 V, and a coating time of 1 to 5 minutes. In the process of baking the electrodeposition coating film after the electrodeposition, the substrate temperature is 100 to 250\u00b0 C., preferably 140 to 220\u00b0 C., and the curing time is 5 to 60 minutes, preferably 10 to 30 minutes. These baking conditions may be applied also in the case where the electrodeposition coating film is coated wet-on-wet with a chipping primer film or an intermediate coating film before curing the electrodeposition coating film and the films are simultaneously baked. The dry thickness of the electrodeposition coating film is suitably 5 to 40 \u03bcm, more preferably 10 to 30 \u03bcm. The above electrodeposition coating conditions may be controlled to obtain the dry thickness.",
        "The chipping primer film and the intermediate coating film may be formed on thus-formed electrodeposition coating film in this order or in the reversed order, and then, an overcoating film such as a lustering agent-containing film and a clear film may be formed thereon, if necessary. The intermediate coating film and the overcoating film may be formed by using known compositions under known conditions for coating outer plates of automobiles, etc.",
        "The chipping primer film is formed on metal articles such as automobile bodies, guardrails, and traffic signs to prevent the coating films of the metal articles from being cracked or peeled off by stones splashed from road surfaces, etc. The chipping primer may be selected from the viewpoints of the strength and the impact resistance of the film, and for example, may have composition comprising a combination of an acid-grafted polyolefin and a butylated melamine resin. Examples of such polyolefins include ethylene-propylene copolymers containing 50 mol % or more of propylene, and the acid component of the acid-grafted polyolefin may be maleic acid, maleic anhydride, etc. Such maleated polyolefin resins are described in JP-A-9-208882, JP-A-4-363371, etc., and T-5H manufactured by Kansai Paint Co., Ltd., BOR-904 manufactured by Sakai Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd., etc. are commercially available maleated polyolefin resins. In the coated article of the present invention, a large amount of the monoalkyltin compound is used as the catalyst for curing the electrodeposition coating film as described above, whereby the amount of the dialkyltin compounds is relatively small. Thus, only a small amount of the dialkyltin compounds are volatilized in the process of baking each films, etc., whereby the coated article excellent in film performances and appearance can be obtained even in the case where the chipping primer is such that the adhesion or the appearance is negatively affected easily by transfer of tin atoms from the electrodeposition coating film.",

On the other hand, the composition of Comparative Example 1 using a small amount of dibutyltin oxide showed insufficient film curability, and the compositions of Comparative Examples 2 and 3 using a large amount of dibutyltin oxide emitted more tin compounds, thereby resulting in reduction of adhesion between the coating films.",
        "The lead-free cationic electrodeposition coating composition of the present invention contains a particular amount of the monoalkyltin compound to show excellent film curability. Further, the monoalkyltin compound has low volatility, and thereby, is hardly transferred to the chipping primer film or the intermediate coating film in the processes of forming the electrodeposition coating film. Thus, the composition can form the electrodeposition coating film with excellent film performances. Furthermore, the amino-epoxy resin can be used as the cationic base resin to increase the corrosion resistance. Therefore, the coated article of the present invention can be used for products requiring high quality and splendid appearance, such as automobile bodies and home electric appliances."
