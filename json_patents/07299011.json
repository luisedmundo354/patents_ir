        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The invention concerns a link adaptation process.",
        "2. Discussion of the Related Art",
        "In known wireless communication systems, information are transmitted via the air interface between two entities of the systems via the physical layer following the ISO-OSI model.",
        "Depending on the current radio link conditions, several physical layer modes can be selected. A physical layer mode specifies a coding rate and modulation conditions. A link adaptation process is implemented for selecting the physical layer modes (PHY modes).",
        "For example, such a link adaptation process is necessary in a High PErformance Radio Local Area Network type 2 (HIPERLAN/2) standard. In the following, the HIPERLAN/2 standard will be used often as an example of framework to describe the context of the invention. However, the field of application of this invention goes beyond the boundaries of the HIPERLAN/2 standard and can be considered for any wireless communication system implenting a link adaptation process.",
        "The Hiperlan/2 standard defines PHYsical (PHY) and Data Link Control (DLC) layers. The link adaptation process is part of the DLC layer.",
        "The air interface is based on dynamic Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA) with Time-Division Duplex (TDD). Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been selected as modulation scheme for H/2 due to its good performance on frequency-selective fading channels. BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying), QPSK (Quaternary Phase Shift Keying), 16QAM (16 points Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) and 64QAM (64 points Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) (optional) are the supported sub-carrier modulation schemes.",
        "The link adaptation process selects the PHY modes by implementing a criteria dependent on the radio link conditions.",
        "In the known link adaptation processes, the criteria implemented for switching between the PHY modes considers the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) or Signal to Noise and Interference Ratio (SINR) as an input.",
        "The PHY modes are selected to obtain an acceptable Bit Error Rate (BER) or Packet Error Rate (PER) which is necessary for the communication depending on the type of data which are transmitted.",
        "The criteria is adapted to select a PHY mode which is able to obtain a requested BER performance considering the current measured SNR or SINR.",
        "In fact, the measured SINR is an averaged SINR since the channel is a time-varying channel. Besides, the relation between the SINR and the BER is not straightforward because it is also very dependent on the transmission channel.",
        "A way to implement the SINR criteria approach is to consider the typical \u201cworst-case\u201d scenario for the channel.",
        "Namely, the prediction of the BER according to the SINR measured will lead to the averaged \u201cworst-case\u201d propagation channel to be used as reference. The thresholds used to select the PHY modes are determined accordingly.",
        "However, information on the SINR combined with information on the channel profile would enable to determine more accurately the BER performance. Indeed, the BER and PER performance does not only depend on SINR but also on the characteristics of the frequency selective fading channel.",
        "A solution to this problem is proposed in \u201cMisunderstandings about link adaptation for frequency selective fading channels\u201d, M. Lampe et al., PIMRC conference, September 2002. This document suggests a link adaptation process based on the SINR with statistics on the type of fading channel.",
        "The problem mentioned in this document is how to predict the PER or BER taking into account SINR and channel statistics.",
        "The type of channel statistics mentioned explicitly is the estimate variance of the absolute value of the channel response in the frequency domain:",
        "I\n    \n      v\n      \u2062\n      \n        \n      \n      \u2062\n      ar\n    \n  \n  =\n  \n    \n      1\n      N\n    \n    \u2062\n    \n      \n        \u2211\n        i\n        N\n      \n      \u2062\n      \n        \n      \n      \u2062\n      \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \uf603\n              \n                \u03c1\n                i\n              \n              \uf604\n            \n            -\n            \n              \uf603\n              \n                \u03c1\n                _\n              \n              \uf604\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        2\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c1i is the channel coefficient (fading channel response in the frequency domain) of the ith sub-carrier of the OFDM signal.",
        "However, the results presented in this article on FIG. 10 are only for the particular channel A of Hiperlan/2 standard and therefore it is difficult to understand how this criteria can be effectively used to become independent from knowledge a-priori of the fading channel.",
        "The aim of the invention is to provide a link adaptation process that can be computed easily and which uses the channel profile properties without being dependent on the a-priori knowledge of the fading channel.",
        "Accordingly, the subject matter of the invention is a process according to claim 1.",
        "The association of a specific metric called Error Vector Magnitude or more precisely of its inverse Receive Modulation Accuracy (RMA) representative of fading channel statistics with a system employing a set of different modulations and/or coding rates called PHY modes, which enables to derive a link adaptation technique which does not require any a-priori knowledge or hypothesis on the said channel.",
        "Indeed, by simulation results, we observed that the relationship between the BER (Bit Error Rate, or PER) and the RMA is almost independent of the channel profile (contrary to the relationship between BER and SINR).",
        "As a result, the RMA can be used to select the PHY mode, independently of the knowledge of channel profile.",
        "In particular implementations, the process includes some features of sub-claims.",
        "The invention also concerns a wireless communication system and a receiver as defined in claims 18 and 19.",

Consequently, resource should be requested prior to actual transmission of their Protocol Data Units (PDU) by mobile terminals transmitting via the uplink phase.

        "Indeed, as defined for instance by Hiperlan/2 standard, each data OFDM symbol contain data in data carriers and reference information in pilot carriers. Thus, each payload symbols includes 4 pilots, which are referenced samples. Therefore, it is also possible to use these 4 pilots to refine the computation of the RMA. The pilots values are known and therefore we can compare the observed sequence with the ideal sequence, like in the preamble part.",
        "In order to limit fast variations of the RMA calculation that could result in some \u201cping-pong\u201d effect, it is advisable to average the computation over several bursts or frames.",

Mobile terminal can also take advantage of the Broadcast Channel (BCH) and Frame Channel (FCH) data (called also Long Traffic Channel LCH in Hiperlan2). Hence averaging is performed on the numerous bursts received in one frame and can also be combined by an averaging on a frame by frame basis.",
        "For the uplink channel, it is necessary for the access point to compute the RMA separately for each connection, i.e. for each mobile terminal, since the level and quality of the received bursts depend on each mobile terminal. Averaging shall be performed separately. The value of the RMA associated to each mobile terminal (like the level of AGC and the precise timing) is stored and can be retrieved the next frame for an averaging.",
        "It has to be noted that in principle (like in Hiperlan2), the access point is the master and decides, according to its scheduling mechanism, of the link adaptation result, i.e. of the PHY mode to be employed. As a consequence, all RMA information computed by mobile terminal on the downlink, shall be send back, over the Uplink to the Access Point. This procedure is identical to the one for the SINR parameter measured on the Downlink by Mobile Terminal.",
        "The most simple procedure is to avoid the calculation of the SINR and to only implement a RMA criteria, i.e. a Link Adaptation criteria only dependent on the RMA.",

        "The method according to the invention has the following advantages.",
        "The RMA is very simple to implement.",
        "It is a criteria very representative of the quality of the transmission channel, it combines the properties of both SINR and channel profile. It can be used as a \u201cequivalent-AWGN-SINR\u201d, to predict the BER or PER quality of the transmission.",
        "The gain by using this criteria is straightforward when considering the commonly employed \u201cworst-case\u201d scenario, since the dispersion of the BER performance with respect to the RMA is much reduced as compared to the SINR case. Hence, the global throughput can be improved.",
        "Further improvement rely on the combination of the RMA with the SINR."
