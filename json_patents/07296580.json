Each roller is provided at its ends with projecting collars for receiving and locating the barrel within the roller with a circumferential gap between the perforated portion of the roller and the barrel. The collars have circumferential apertures which cooperate with a retaining clip on the handle for securing the roller in place during use. While the external diameter of each roller is different for making different size curls, the collars of all the rollers have the same internal diameter so that the same curling iron can be used to heat the different diameter rollers.",
        "Hair curling apparatus comprises a curling iron that can be inserted in a curling roller. The curling iron has a shaft for insertion in the roller formed by a number of elongate plate-like members, and the interior surface of the roller is formed with corresponding slots for receiving the edges of the plate-like members. Thus the curling iron may be easily located and secured within the roller. In another embodiment the curling iron is provided with a projection in an end face of the handle, the projection being received within a corresponding aperture formed in an end member of the roller.",
        "A hair styling device comprising a handle having a first curler interlocking element, a heatable curler having a second curler interlocking element, and a clamp attached to the handle and extending therefrom. The clamp is adapted to grasp hair between the clamp and the curler. The curler has a non-conductive upper rim with a cutaway portion. The clamp, the first interlocking element, and the second interlocking element are adapted to cooperatively secure the curler removably to the handle. Various embodiments for the interlocking elements are provided. The hair styling device may be part of a hair styling system further comprising a plurality of curlers and a heater for heating the curlers. There is also provided a method for curling hair with the hair styling system described.",

Means 8 are provided for engaging the supporting surface with the handle so that they rotate together, or disengaging the supporting surface from the handle so that it may rotate independently of the handle. The appliance may be particularly designed for care of the hair, the supporting surface being in the form of a brush. The coupling between the brush and handle facilitates winding the hair on to the brush and the rapid disengagement of the hair from the brush. The means 8 may comprise a ring which is axially slidable relative to the handle and which has slots 10 which cooperate with lugs 9 on the brush.",
        "A hair curling iron with a barrel (2) may be inserted into a curling drum (100), and a retaining clip (3) retains the barrel (2) in this position; the hair curling drum (100) can receive and locate the barrel (2) of a curling iron. Hair may be curled by putting the curling drums (100) in position in the hair, and then heating and reheating them as often as necessary using the hair curling iron. The advantage is a considerable saving in labour.",
        "A notching device inside the hair roller (5) latches releasably and easily between the roller and the hair-drier adapter (2) in a spring design whose first notching element works with a rigid element fitted to the drier adapter. The roller preferably has two pairs of identically spaced opposing elements, notably a latching groove (12) on a spring leg (25) within the roller working with a nose (27) run right round the adapter. A releasable hair clip (20) grips part of the roller casing along its longitudinal axis by a spring clasp (29). The plug-in section (30) on the clip alongside the clasp plugs into the rear endface entry (21) of the drier facing away from this as against the entry (16) in the near endface which is turned towards the drier. A third notching element formed by a nose (31) round the clip plug-in section locks into the groove (32) in the roller to complete four-fold notching.",
