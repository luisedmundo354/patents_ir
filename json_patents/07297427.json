        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a fuel cell system which generates electricity through the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, and process for controlling the fuel cell in the fuel cell system. More particularly, the invention relates to a fuel cell system having improved performance during the transition period, at which the power generation amount is changed, and a process for producing the same.",
        "2. Description of Related Arts",
        "In recent years, an electric powered vehicles each carrying various driving motors instead of the conventional engine has been developed. One example of such types of electric powered vehicles includes a fuel cell carried vehicle having a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell abbreviated as \u201cPEM FC\u201d (hereinafter PEM type fuel cell or simply referred to as fuel cell) as a power source for a driving motor, and such PEM type fuel cell carried vehicles have been sharply developed.",
        "PEM FC comprises a stack structure having a lot of single cells, which are power generation units, laminated on each other. Each cell has a configuration composed of an anode side separator having a hydrogen passage, a cathode side separator having an oxygen passage, and a membrane-electrode assembly (hereinafter abbreviated as \u201cMEA\u201d) intervened between these separators. MEA is composed of a proton exchange membrane abbreviated as PEM, each surface of PEM with a catalyst layer and a gas diffusion layer laminated one after another (one surface having an anode side catalyst layer and a gas diffusion layer and the other having a cathode side catalyst layer and a gas diffusion layer).",
        "In such PEM FC, when hydrogen gas flows through the hydrogen passage from the inlet side to the outlet side of the anode and when air (as an oxidant gas) flows through the oxygen passage from the inlet side to the outlet side of the cathode, the protons permeate through PEM of MEA in a wet state from the anode side of each cell, migrating to the cathode side. This causes each cell to generate electromotive force of approximately 1 V. In PEM FC having such a power generation mechanism, air and hydrogen are continuously supplied to continue the power generation. Consequently, an air intake system, which compresses air, for example, by a compressor is provided at the inlet side of cathode, and an air exhaust system, for example, having a backpressure control valve, is provided on the outlet side of cathode. In addition, a hydrogen gas supply system, which supplies hydrogen by an ejector, is provided on the inlet side of anode.",
        "As described above, in the fuel cell system having the air supply system, the air exhaust system, and the hydrogen supply system provided on the fuel cell, the revolution speed of the compressor is controlled to be increased or decreased by increasing or decreasing an amount of the air flowing to the cathode inlet, whereby a power generation amount (output current or output power) is controlled (increased or decreased). At this time, if the pressure difference between the poles, i.e., the difference between the hydrogen pressure and the air pressure, becomes unduly large, there is a fear of breaking PEM making up MEA. Consequently, the hydrogen gas pressure at the anode inlet side and the air pressure at the cathode inlet side are separately controlled so that the pressure difference between the poles falls within a tolerance range. Specifically, in the conventional fuel cell system, the revolution speed of the compressor is controlled to be a target value where the air-flow amount to the cathode inlet side is controlled to be a target air flow amount, and the opening of the backpressure control valve of the air exhaust system is controlled so that the air pressure becomes a target pressure.",
        "Meanwhile, it takes a very short period that the opening of the backpressure control valve reaches a target value in comparison with the period that the air pressure reaches a target air pressure. However, in the conventional fuel cell system, the opening of the backpressure control valve is sharply controlled so as to be a target value corresponding to the target airflow amount. For example, as shown in FIG. 5, when the airflow amount Q is increased to a given target airflow amount QT, the opening \u03b3 of the backpressure control valve is sharply controlled to be a target value corresponding to the target airflow amount QT as shown in the broken line. For this reason, at the transition period until the airflow amount Q reaches the target airflow amount QT, the backpressure control valve is excessively wide-opened to the target opening corresponding to the target airflow amount QT in advance and, thus, the pressure P of the air to be compressively transferred toward the cathode inlet by a supercharger is escaped toward downstream of the backpressure control valve. As a result, the air pressure P at the cathode inlet side is once decreased and then reaches a target air pressure PT, conducting that the pressure increase is delayed. The behavior at the time where the airflow amount Q is decreased to a given target airflow amount QT is that the air pressure P is once increased, and then reaches the target air pressure PT during the transition period, delaying the decreasing of the pressure.",
        "In the conventional fuel cell system as described above, during the transition period when the airflow amount at the cathode inlet side is increased or decreased to a target airflow amount corresponding to the decreasing or increasing of the power generation amount, the air pressure at the cathode inlet side is once decreased or increased. Accordingly, there poses a problem that pressure difference between the poles in the fuel cell system (pressure difference between the anode side and the cathode side applied to PEM of MEA) is increased. Also, the conventional fuel cell system is disadvantageous in that there is a time lag until the air pressure at the cathode inlet reaches a target air pressure, leading to poor responsibility.",
        "It is, therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a fuel cell system and a process for controlling the same, which can prevent the increasing of the pressure difference between the poles in the fuel cell during the transition period when the airflow amount toward the cathode inlet reaches a target airflow amount, and which can solve a time lag until the air pressure at the cathode inlet side reaches a target air pressure.",
        "According to the present invention, there is provided a process for controlling a fuel cell comprising a fuel cell, which generates power by supplying anode gas and cathode gas into the fuel cell, a compressor which controls the amount of the gas to be supplied into the fuel cell, and a pressure control valve which controls the gas pressure of the fuel cell and which is provided on the downstream of the fuel cell,",
        "said process comprising:",
        "changing an amount of the supply gas by said compressor during the transition period of said fuel cell, and thereafter, changing the opening of said pressure control valve.",
        "Also, there is provided a process for controlling a fuel cell comprising:",
        "a flow amount feedback control step which controls the flow amount of the gas supplied into a fuel cell to be a prescribed value; and",
        "a pressure feedback control step which controls the pressure of the fuel cell to be a prescribed value,",
        "said feedback steps being stopped during the transition period of the fuel cell.",
        "According to the present invention a fuel cell system is also provided, which comprises a fuel cell, which generates power by supplying anode gas and cathode gas into the fuel cell,",
        "a compressor which controls the amount of the gas to be supplied into the fuel cell,",
        "a pressure control valve which controls the gas pressure of the fuel cell and which is provided on the downstream of the fuel cell,",
        "airflow control means, which controls the airflow toward the cathode inlet side to be a target airflow amount corresponding to a target power generation amount of the fuel cell by controlling the revolution number of said compressor, and",
        "air pressure control means, which controls the air pressure at the cathode inlet to be a target air pressure corresponding to the target airflow amount by controlling the opening of said pressure control valve at the stationary state, and which controls the pressure control valve corresponding to the change in the airflow amount detected from said flow sensor to thereby control the air pressure to be the target air pressure during the transition period.",
        "In the fuel cell system according to the present invention, said air pressure control means during the transition period preferably controls the opening of said pressure control valve depending upon the airflow amount detected from the flow sensor and upon the target air pressure.",
        "Also, in the fuel cell system according to the present invention, said air pressure control means during the transition period is preferably kept operating until said airflow amount reaches the target airflow amount.",
        "Furthermore, according to the present invention, there is also provided a process for controlling a fuel cell comprising controlling the power generation amount of the fuel cell by controlling the flow amount and the pressure of the air compressively transferred into the cathode inlet side of the fuel cell, and",
        "controlling said air pressure to be a target airflow amount corresponding the detected airflow amount, which is gradually changed, during the transition period of said fuel cell.",
        "According to the process for controlling the fuel cell of the present invention and the fuel cell system of the present invention, which controls the amount of the supply gas and thereafter controls the opening of the pressure control valve, the increasing of the pressure difference between the poles within the fuel cell can be prevented, ensuring the prevention of the damage of PEM making up MEA of the fuel cell. What is more, the time delay by which the air pressure at the cathode inlet side reached the target air pressure can be solved, improving the response to the increasing or decreasing of the power generation amount of the fuel cell.",

It is also possible to provide an air-intake silencer such as a resonator at the upstream of the air cleaner (A/C) 7A.",
        "The supercharger (S/C) 7B can be driven at a rotation speed ranging from 0 to 12,000 rpm, and can linearly change an airflow amount Q depending upon the rotation speed.

As the pressure sensor 7E, an appropriate type pressure sensor, such as a semiconductor type pressure sensor, can be used.",
        "The air exhaust system 8 of the fuel cell (FC) 8 has a backpressure control valve 8A for controlling air pressure P at the cathode inlet side of the fuel cell (FC) 3.

It is noted that the hydrogen intake system 9 is configured so that the hydrogen gas remaining unused in power generation and exhausted from the anode outlet is recycled into the ejector 9C.",

        "As the software configuration, the control unit 11 is composed of airflow control means (program), which controls the flow amount Q of the air flowing toward the cathode inlet side of the fuel cell (FC) 3 to be a target airflow amount corresponding to a target power generation amount of the fuel cell (FC) 3 by controlling the rotation speed of the supercharger (S/C) 7B, and air pressure control means (program), which controls the air pressure P at the cathode inlet to be a target air pressure corresponding to the target airflow amount through controlling the opening of the backpressure control valve 8A.

Consequently, the increasing of the pressure difference between the poles within the fuel cell (FC) 3 can be prevented, ensuring the prevention of the damage of PEM making up MEA of the fuel cell (FC) 3. What is more, the time delay by which the air pressure P at the cathode inlet side reached the target air pressure PT can be solved, improving the response to the increasing or decreasing of the power generation amount of the fuel cell (FC) 3.",
