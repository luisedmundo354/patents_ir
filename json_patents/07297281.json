Although not illustrated, it should be appreciated that the nanostructured adsorption material 21 may be provided with a plurality of layers as shown in FIG. 2A, while each layer may include pores 23 of various nanoscale size ranges interspersed therein, similar to those in FIG. 2B.",
        "The porous matrix 20 used in connection with the system 10 of the present invention may, in one embodiment, be formed from, for instance, porous char generated from various starting materials, for example, discarded or used automobile tires or other materials that can generate a relatively high fixed carbon content within the porous char. Of course, new automobile tires or similar starting materials may also be used to generated the porous char. In one embodiment, the starting materials may be heated in a reactor, within which the environment may be controlled, initially from room temperature to about 250\u00b0 C. to 300\u00b0 C. During this initial heating period, a mixture of condensable and non-condensable gases may be given off from the starting material within the reactor. This mixture of gases, which can be captured for reintroduction at a later stage, can typically include approximately 25%-35% carbon dioxide, approximately 10%-15% carbon monoxide, approximately 5%-10% methane, approximately 1%-5% volatile acids, with the remaining portion containing a mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, hydrocarbons, i.e., organic materials.",
        "Upon the reaching between 250\u00b0 C. to 300\u00b0 C., an exothermic reaction can occur within the reactor pushing the temperature of the reactor and thus the resulting porous char to temperatures ranging from about 500\u00b0 C. to about 600\u00b0 C. During this period, the previously captured condensable and non-condensable gases may be reintroduced into the reactor for exposure to the porous char. The resulting porous char may contain, at this stage, mostly macro-pores and may only be moderately dense in nature. To subsequently obtain a nanostructured adsorption material, this moderately dense porous char must be transformed to a relatively high-density material with a relatively high fixed carbon content.",
        "To generate a relatively high fixed carbon content in the porous char, impurities present in the starting materials, and in the transformed material, i.e., porous char, may be removed, using known procedures, at various stages during the conversion process to produce a fixed carbon content in the porous char of greater than about 90% to about 95%. It should be noted that, on average, approximately 20 pounds of starting material, e.g., used tires, will yield about 4 pounds of porous char with a fixed carbon content of between 90% to 95%. Once the condensable and non-condensable gases have been reintroduced into the reactor, the temperature within the reactor may be increased so that the porous char may be heated at a relatively high temperature range of from about 1000\u00b0 C. to about 1100\u00b0 C. to enlarge the pores within the porous char. During this stage, a controlled mixture of steam and air may be introduced into the reactor. In one embodiment, for approximately 1 pound of porous char, from about 1.0 pound to about 1.5 pounds of steam and air mixture may be injected into the reactor. The amount of steam and air may vary depending upon how much the pores within the porous char are to be enlarged, and could vary from about 0.5 pounds to over 2.0 pounds per pound of porous char. The introduction of steam and air into the reactor, in one embodiment, can generate a producer gas in the presence of the hot porous char. The content of the producer gas may vary, but can contain about 15%-20% hydrogen, 20%-25% carbon monoxide, with the remainder a mixture of nitrogen, hydrocarbons and other organic materials.",
        "By exposing the porous char to such a temperature range and a mixture of steam and air, the porous char may be transformed into a relatively high density nanostructured material having the desired porosity. Typically, approximately 1 pound of the high density nanostructured material can be generated from the 4 pounds of the porous char. The exposure of the porous char to such high temperature, in addition to enlarging and generating pores of various nanoscale sizes, can provide the resulting nanostructured adsorption material with internal surface areas ranging from at least approximately 1000 m2/g to approximately 3000 m2/g, and higher.",
        "The resulting nanostructured material, similar to nanostructured adsorption material 21 shown in FIGS. 2A-B, may be used in connection with the porous matrix 20 of the present invention. It should be noted that the process of enlarging the pores structure to specific nanoscale ranges, along with the removal of impurities within the porous char can impart special properties to the nanostructured material. In particular, such a process can impart the nanostructured material with adsorption properties necessary for removal of particulates and contaminants.",
        "In addition to the size of the nanoscale pores, the ability of nanostructured material to adsorb particulates and contaminant molecules can also be dependent upon the structure of the nanoscale pores, the total surface area, the carbon particle size, and the void space between carbon particles. Specifically, as the nanostructured adsorption material, such as item 21 in FIGS. 2A and 2B, essentially comprises nanocarbon particles 26, the spaces 27 between these nanocarbon particles must be sufficiently small, i.e., nanoscale in size and smaller than the molecules of the fluid, so as to facilitate the fluid going through the pores 23 within the nanoadsorption material 21 and not through spaces around the pores 23. Likewise, should the carbon particles be larger than nanoscale size, such large carbon particles may block, partially block, and/or create interference with the flow of the fluid into the pores 23, thus allowing fluid to flow away from the pores 23. As a result, particulates and/or contaminants within the fluid flow may escape entrapment within the pores 23.",
        "It should be appreciated that since one surface 25 of the porous matrix 20 is substantially impermeable to fluid, the porous matrix 20 of the present invention does not have flow-through properties similar to commercially available filters. Rather, fluid flowing against or across the contact surface 24 will enter and exit along the contact surface 24. Specifically, fluid flowing against or across the contact surface 24 into the nanostructured adsorption material 21 cannot thereafter exit through surface 25. In the presence of the impermeable surface 25, the fluid directed into one opening of a pore 23 adjacent the impermeable surface 25 may subsequently be allowed to flow out another opening of pore 23 not blocked by the impermeable surface 25, as illustrated by the arrows in FIGS. 2A and 2B, and eventually make its way out through the contact surface 24. Impermeable surface 25, in one embodiment of the present invention, may be generated by applying a layer of a substantially fluid impermeable material to one surface of the porous matrix 20.",
        "The porous matrix 20 may further, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, be impregnated with, for instance, silver or silver compound(s) so as to minimize microbial growth within the porous matrix 20. In particular, the nanostructured adsorption material 21 may be treated with a silver compound in the presence of acid or alkaline materials, depending on the silver compound used, so that the silver compound can be substantially evenly distributed against internal surfaces of pores 23. Since this process can generate undesirable materials during the chemical reactions, such materials can be removed, in one embodiment, by leaching. The process employed herein can enhance the properties of the porous matrix 20. In addition to removal of particulates and contaminants, the presence of the silver compound, as noted, can minimize microbial growth within the porous matrix 20. Furthermore, it should be noted that the silver content provided within the porous matrix 20 using the process described herein may be at a level far below the permissible limits of silver in drinking water. In an embodiment, the silver content may be approximately 1 percent by weight. Additionally, the process employed herein can minimize the leaching of the silver content from within the porous matrix 20. In this manner, the presence of the silver compound within the porous matrix 20 does not act to elevate the level of silver above permissible limits.",
        "With reference now to FIGS. 3A-B, there is illustrated a system 30 for purification of fluid by removing contaminants, such as microorganisms, organic, inorganic and particulate matter from the fluid. The system 30, in one embodiment, may include a receptacle 31, similar to that of system 10 shown in FIG. 1. The receptacle 31 may include a chamber 32 for accommodating a volume of fluid, and an opening 33 through which a volume of fluid may be introduced into the chamber 32. A cover 34 may be provided across the opening 33 to prevent spillage of fluid from within the chamber 32.",
        "The system 30 may also include a porous matrix 35 positioned within the chamber 32 for the removal of contaminants from the fluid. The porous matrix 35, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, may be substantially similar to the porous matrix 20 of FIGS. 2A-B, and may be used to retain or trap particulates and/or contaminants in the fluid. The porous matrix 35, as shown in FIG. 3B, and used in connection with system 30, may be embedded within chamber walls 36, so that contact surface 37 may be exposed to the fluid within the chamber 32, while substantially impermeable surface 38 may be positioned against chamber walls 36. In one embodiment, the porous matrix 35 may be embedded substantially circumferentially about chamber walls 36. Although illustrated as extending partially up walls 36, should it be desired, porous matrix 35 may be permitted to extend substantially along the length of walls 36. To embed the porous matrix 35 within the walls 36, means known in the art may be employed, for instance, co-extrusion of the porous matrix 35 along with the material comprising receptacle 31. In one embodiment of the present invention, porous matrix 35 may be provided with a thickness ranging from about 0.20 mm to about 0.30 mm.",
        "In an alternate embodiment, instead of being embedded within the walls 36 of the chamber 32, the porous matrix 35, made from a nanostructured adsorption material, may be applied directly onto the walls 36. In one embodiment, the porous matrix may be coated onto walls 36 as a thin film or layer. Alternatively, the porous matrix 35 may be designed as a sheet of material that can be adhered to the walls 36 of chamber 32. Regardless of the adherence material used, such material should be one that is non degradable in the presence of fluid. In either embodiment, the thin film or sheet of porous matrix 35 may be designed so that it is sufficiently flexible and pliable for removal or insertion across opening 33.",
        "Looking now to FIGS. 4A and 4B, there is illustrated a system 40 for purification of fluid by removing contaminants, such as microorganisms, organic, inorganic and particulate matter from the fluid, similar to the systems disclosed above. The system 40, in one embodiment, may include a receptacle 41 having a chamber 42 for accommodating a volume of fluid, and an opening 43 through which a volume of fluid may be introduced into the chamber 42. A cover 44 may be provided across the opening 43 to prevent spillage of fluid from within the chamber 42.",
        "The system 40 may also include a porous matrix 45 positioned within the chamber 42 for the removal of contaminants from the fluid. The porous matrix 45, being substantially similarly to the previous porous matrices, acts to retain or trap therein contaminants from the fluid. As illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4B, the porous matrix 45, made from a nanostructured adsorption material, may be designed as a substantially cylindrical tube 47 having a contact surface 471, and an opposing impermeable surface 472. The porous matrix 45, as shown in FIG. 4A, may be positioned away from walls 46 of chamber 42. In one embodiment, as illustrated from the perspective of FIG. 4B, porous matrix 45 may be positioned substantially concentrically to the walls 46, and may be designed to have a diameter that permits its removal from or placement within the chamber 42 through opening 43. In order to maintain porous matrix 45 substantially concentric to the walls 46, a base (not shown) may be provided within which porous matrix 45 may be positioned. Alternatively, porous matrix 45 may be permitted to float freely within the chamber 42.",
        "In FIG. 5, there is illustrated another system 50 for purification of a fluid by removing contaminants, such as microorganisms, organic, inorganic and particulate matter from the fluid, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The system 50, similar to the previously disclosed systems, may include a receptacle 51 having a chamber 52 for accommodating a volume of fluid, and an opening 53 through which a volume of fluid may be introduced into the chamber 52. A cover 54 may be provided across the opening 53 to prevent spillage of fluid from within the chamber 52.",
        "The system 50 may also include a porous matrix 55 positioned within the chamber 52 for retaining, trapping, and thus removal of contaminants from the fluid. The porous matrix 55, made from a nanostructured adsorption material, and in accordance with this particular embodiment of the present invention, may be provided as a loose mass of macro particles 56 that can freely move within the fluid in chamber 52. Each of the particles 56 may include a contact surface 561 and an impermeable core (not shown), so that fluid may be prevented from flowing through the particles 56. The particles 56, in one embodiment, may be uniform in size and shape, or as illustrated, vary in size and shape. It should be appreciated that the particles 56 may be of a size and shape that would facilitate their removal from or placement within the chamber 52 through opening 53 for replacement purposes.",
        "In another embodiment, referring now to FIG. 6, a system 60 is provided for purification of fluid by removing contaminants, such as microorganisms, organic, inorganic and particulate matter from the fluid. The system 60, as with the previously disclosed systems, may include a receptacle 61 having a chamber 62 for accommodating a volume of fluid, and an opening 63 through which a volume of fluid may be introduced into the chamber 62. A cover 64 may be provided across the opening 63 to prevent spillage of fluid from within the chamber 62.",
        "The system 60 may also include a porous matrix 65, made from a nanostructured adsorption material, that is positioned within the chamber 52 for retaining, trapping, and thus removal of contaminants from the fluid. The porous matrix 65, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, may be placed circumferentially about walls 66 at an end 67 of the chamber 62 opposite the opening 63. In addition, porous matrix 65 may be designed to be sufficiently flexible and pliable to permit its removal from and placement within the chamber 62 through opening 63.",
        "In an alternate embodiment, receptacle 61 may be provided with a removable end 67 about which porous matrix 65 may be circumferentially situated. In this manner, should the porous matrix 65 needs to be exchanged, the end 67 may be removed from receptacle 61 and disposed along with matrix 65, and a new end 67 with new porous matrix 65 may be reattached to receptacle 61. To permit removal from the receptacle 61, the end 67 and the receptacle 61 may be provided with threaded engagement. Alternatively, other engagement mechanisms known in the art, for example, snap-fit etc., may be used, so long as such engagement can prevent leakage of fluid from within the chamber 62, while permitting easy removal of end 67 from the receptacle 61.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 7, the system of the present invention may be used to purify fluid by removing particulates and/or contaminants from the fluid, such as water, when the levels of particulates and/or contaminants exceed the prescribed limits for fluid that is intended for human consumption. The limits of contaminants in the drinking fluids may be prescribed by the regulators. In operation, fluid 71 that may include particulates and/or contaminants may be initially be introduced into the chamber of receptacle 72. Once introduced within the receptacle 72, the fluid along with the molecules of contaminants therein, when come into contact with the porous matrix having the nanostructured adsorption material (e.g., flowing against or across the contact surface of the porous matrix), may be directed into the pores of the nanostructured adsorption material, wherein the molecules of contaminants may be trapped. It should be noted that the movement of fluid within the receptacle caused by or due to, for instance, shaking or moving of the receptacle should be sufficient to direct the flow of contaminants into the pores. If the situation is such that there is no movement of fluid within the receptacle, the contaminants may still be removed by slow molecular displacement or diffusion of molecules into the porous matrix within the receptacle.",
        "Since the phenomenon occurs at a molecular level, the particulates and/or contaminants typically cannot be released from the pores within which they are trapped without enormous pressure or the application of heat at elevated levels. As the particulates and/or contaminants enter and become trapped within the pores, the weight of nanostructured adsorption material can increase to a measurable difference. Such an increase can be detected and displayed, for example, by a sensor, to indicate, for instance, the levels of contaminants removed from the fluid.",
        "Accordingly, still referring to FIG. 7, a sensor 73 may be coupled to the receptacle 72, such that the sensor 73 may be in communication with a porous matrix within the receptacle in order to display the levels of contaminants removed from the fluid. Sensor 73 can be any sensor which can detect a pressure, weight or heat differential between a porous matrix at time to and the same porous matrix at time tn, subsequent to exposure of the porous matrix to the fluid. In one embodiment, the sensor 73 may include pressure detector sufficiently thin (e.g., thin layer wired mesh or sheet), so as to be capable of being embedded within the nanostructured adsorption material of the porous matrix, and a display in communication with the detector. The pressure detector can act to transform the pressure differential between to and tn into electrical signals that can subsequently be process and shown on the display as the amount of particulates or contaminants in the porous matrix or the amount of contaminant removed.",
        "The sensor 73 may alternatively employ a weight sensor. It is noted that if at to the weight of the porous matrix is x milligram, then at tn, for instance, 15 seconds, when the nanostructured material of the porous matrix has had a chance to adsorb the particulates and/or contaminants, the weight of nanostructured adsorption material will be x+y, with y being the weight of contaminants that has been removed from the fluid. The weight increase due to the adsorption of the contaminants can be transformed to electrical signals, which can subsequently be displayed as information on a scale in terms of percentage of contaminants removed from the fluid.",
        "The sensor 73 may also employ a heat sensor. If, for instance, at to the temperature of the porous matrix is x degrees, then at tn, for instance, 15 seconds, when the nanostructured material of the porous matrix has had a chance to adsorb the particulates and/or contaminants, the heat generated in the nanostructured adsorption material will be x+y, with y being the temperature increase due to the adsorption of contaminants in the nanostructured material. This temperature increase can be transformed to electrical signals, which can subsequently be displayed as information on a scale in terms of percentage of contaminants removed from the fluid.",
        "Whether using the pressure, weight and/or heat detector, when the nanostructured adsorption material approaches about 90% its capacity level for trapping particulates and/or contaminants, the sensor 73, in one embodiment, can be designed to warn the user, for instance, by audio, visual, or other applicable indicators, that the porous matrix needs replacing or that the receptacle can no longer be used, if the receptacle is designed to be a disposable system.",
        "The system of the present invention, accordingly, may be refilled over and over again with fluid to be treated. The system may be used successively to generate purified fluid meeting standards or limits prescribed for human consumption, until the nanostructured adsorption material of the porous matrix approaches its exhaustive capacity for trapping and retaining particles therein, i.e., having entrapped and retained therein particulates and/or contaminants at about 90% of its capacity.",
        "While the invention has been described in connection with the specific embodiments thereof, it will be understood that it is capable of further modification. Furthermore, this application is intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention, including such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which the invention pertains, and as fall within the scope of the appended claims."
