A communication device 402 is able to communicate with a communication device 404 over a communication channel 406. A transmitter according to embodiments of the present invention may be present in communication device 402 only or in communication device 404 only or in both communication devices 402 and 404. The following description is based on the example of a transmitter according to one or another of the embodiments of the present invention present in communication device 402 only, although the present invention is not limited in this respect.",
        "Although the present invention is not limited in this respect, the communication system shown in FIG. 6 may be part of a cellular communication system, with one of communication devices 402, 404 being a base station and the other a mobile station or with both communication devices 402, 404 being mobile stations, a pager communication system, a personal digital assistant and a server, etc. Communication devices 402 and 404 may include antennas 408 and 410, respectively, which may be, for example, dipole antennas, loop antennas, shot antennas dual antennas, omni-directional antennas or any other suitable antennas.",
        "Communication device 402 may include a transmitter 412 that may include a phase splitter 414, a differential sum/difference block 416 and a power amplifier 418. Phase splitter outphasing 414 may receive a differential signal 420 that may contain information to be transmitted, and may output differential phase shifted signals 422 and 424 having amplitudes substantially similar to the amplitude of signal 420. Differential phase shifted signal 424 may have a phase delay of substantially 90\u00b0 relative to differential phase shifted signal 422.",

Similarly, power amplifier 418 may receive differential difference outphased signal 428 and may amplify it, using for example, a second power amplifying element (not shown). Although the present invention is not limited in this respect, power amplifier 418 may combine these amplified signals by means of, for example, a transmission-line-combiner with reactive shunt terminations, and may output an RF signal 430 that may then be transmitted by antenna 408 over communication channel 406. Alternatively, the transmission-line-combiner may be replaced by a different combiner scheme, such as, for example, Hybrid BALUN or center-tap inductor.",
