        "The invention includes embodiments that may relate to a thermal transport structure. The invention includes embodiments that may relate to a method of making and/or using the thermal transport structure.",
        "2. Discussion of Related Art",
        "Some electronic devices generate heat during operation that may need to be dissipated. As electronic devices become denser and more highly integrated, the heat flux requirement may increase. Because of performance and reliability considerations, the devices may need to operate at lower temperatures. The operating temperature requirement may reduce the temperature difference between the heat-generating device and the ambient temperature, which may decrease the thermodynamic driving force for heat removal. The increased heat flux and reduced thermodynamic driving force may require a thermal management technique to facilitate heat removal during operation.",
        "Thermal management techniques may use some form of heat-dissipating unit (e.g., a heat spreader, heat sink, lid, or heat pipe) to conduct heat away from high temperature areas in an electronic device. A heat-dissipating unit may include a thermally conductive material that is mechanically coupled to a heat-generating unit to aid in heat removal from the heat-generating unit. A dissipating unit may include a metal article in contact with the heat-generating unit, such as a heat radiator fin. Heat from the heat-generating unit may flow through the mechanical interface between the units into the heat-dissipating unit.",
        "In an electronic package, a heat-dissipating unit may be mechanically coupled to the heat producing component during operation by positioning a flat surface of the heat-dissipating unit against a flat surface of the heat producing component and holding the heat-dissipating unit in place using some form of adhesive or fastener. A heat-dissipating unit may be attached to the heat-generating component via a thin-layer of thermal interface material (TIM). This material may be a filled polymer system. The effectiveness of heat removal from the device may depend on the in-situ thermal resistance of the TIM material, which may depend on the bulk thermal conductivities of the TIM material. While, the usage of thermal interface material may provide mechanical stability compared to adhesives, thermal resistance may be exacerbated by the bulk of the thermal interface material.",
        "It may be desirable to obtain a structure and/or method for thermal transport than might not otherwise be available. It may be desirable to obtain a structure and/or method for thermal transport having relatively improved thermal transport performance. It may be desirable to obtain a structure and/or method with a relatively higher thermal conductivity in a pre-determined direction than might otherwise be available.",

Further, the thermal transport structure may also include a resin layer secured to the thermal transport layer second surface, where the resin layer is relatively less thermally conductive than the thermal transport.",
        "In one embodiment, a thermal management system is provided. The system may include a heat-generating unit, a heat-dissipating unit, and a thermal transport structure located between the heat-generating unit and the heat-dissipating unit.

        "As used herein, a term thermal transport structure may refer to an engineered structure for use in an electronic assembly. Thermally conductive may include the ability to conduct heat, and may refer to a physical constant for a quantity of heat that may pass through a predetermined volume in a unit of time, for units involving a difference in temperature across the volume. Tack free may refer to a surface that does not possess pressure sensitive adhesive properties at about room temperature. By one measure, a tack free surface will not adhere or stick to a finger placed lightly in contact therewith at about 25 degrees Celsius. Solid refers to a property such that a material does flow perceptibly under moderate stress, or has a definite capacity for resisting one or more forces (e.g., compression or tension) that may otherwise tend to deform it. In one aspect, under ordinary conditions a solid may retain a definite size and shape. The term \u201cfree\u201d may be used in combination with a term, and may include insubstantial or trace amounts while still being considered free of the modified term. For example, free of solvent or solvent-free, and like terms and phrases, may include a significant portion, some, or all of the solvent having been removed, for example, during B-staging. B-staging a resin layer, and related terms and phrases, may include one or more of heating for a predetermined amount of time, optionally under vacuum; removing some or all of a solvent; at least partially solidifying the material; and/or advancing the cure or cross-linking of a curable resin from an uncured state to a partially, but not completely, cured state.",
        "Approximating language, as used herein throughout the specification and claims, may be applied to modify any quantitative representation that could permissibly vary without resulting in a change in the basic function to which it is related. Accordingly, a value modified by a term or terms, such as \u201cabout\u201d, may not to be limited to the precise value specified. In at least some instances, the approximating language may correspond to the precision of an instrument for measuring the value.",
        "In one embodiment, a thermal transport structure is provided. The thermal transport structure may include a thermal transport layer having a first surface and a second surface. The thermal transport layer may have a thermally conductive material disposed within. The thermally conductive material may be oriented in a predetermined direction in order to facilitate heat conduction relative to the predetermined direction. The thermal transport structure may include a resin layer secured to the thermal transport layer second surface, and the resin layer may be relatively less thermally conductive than the thermal transport layer.",
        "In some embodiments of the invention, the thermally conductive material may have anisotropic thermal conductivity. That is to say, the thermally conductive material of the thermal transport layer may have a relatively higher value of thermal conductivity in a preferred direction. The plane having relatively higher thermal conductivity values may be employed to transfer heat from one object to another while offering lesser thermal resistance as compared to other planes. For example, the thermally conductive material may be oriented in a predetermined direction in order to facilitate heat conduction between the heat sink and the heat spreader in a thermal management system through the plane having higher thermal conductivity.",
        "Suitable thermally conductive material may include one or more of alumina, boron nitride, silica, talc, zinc oxide, and the like. Other suitable thermally conductive material may include a metal particulate. Suitable metals may include one or more of indium, aluminum, gallium, boron, phosphorus, silver or tin. The metal particulate may include an alloy, oxide, nitride or the like of one or more of the foregoing metals. In one embodiment, the thermally conductive material may include one or both of aluminum nitride or boron nitride.",
        "In some embodiments of the invention, the thermally conductive material may be coated. Suitable coatings may affect one or more attributes of the thermally conductive material, or of the resulting thermal transport structure. Such attributes may include one or more of thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, bond-line thickness, cohesion, adhesion, transparency, workability, and the like. Liquid metals, as discrete particles or as a coating on other particles, may be used in embodiments of the invention. In one embodiment, the thermally conductive material may be coated with, for example, a silver coating or a gallium coating.",
        "The thermally conductive material may have an average particle diameter that may be selected to control the spacing of layers adjoining the layer in which the particles are disposed. That is, the particles may function as both a spacer and as a thermally conductive filler. In one embodiment, the thermally conductive material may have an average particle diameter in a range of from about 1 nanometer to about 25 nanometers, from about 25 nanometers to about 50 nanometers, from about 50 nanometers to about 100 nanometers, from about 100 nanometers to about 1 micrometer, from about 1 micrometer to about 10 micrometers, from about 10 micrometer to about 100 micrometers, from about 100 micrometers to about 500 micrometers, or greater than about 500 micrometers. The particle size distribution (PSD) may be selected so that the particles are of uniform size and shape, or may be selected as a multi-modal distribution. For multi-modal distributions, the particles may be selected to achieve a pre-determined packing configuration (with the smaller particles filling the gaps defined by the larger particles). In one embodiment, the particles of one of the modes may differ not only in size, but also in shape and/or composition.",
        "In one embodiment, the thermally conductive material may include thermal pyrolytic graphite (TPG). In one embodiment, the thermally conductive material may consist essentially of TPG. The TPG may be oriented in a predetermined direction relative to a desired thermal flow path. The in-plane thermal conductivity of the TPG material may be higher than the thermal conductivity in the through plane direction. By cladding the desired thermal flow path with relatively less thermally conductive material, the desired thermal flow path may be defined further and the thermal energy transport may be controlled further.",
        "The thermally conductive material may be present in the thermal transport layer in an amount in a range of greater than about 1 weight percent, based on the weight of the thermal transport layer. In one embodiment, thermally conductive material may be present in an amount in a range of from about 1 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, from about 10 weight percent to about 15 weight percent, from about 15 weight percent to about 25 weight percent, from about 25 weight percent to about 50 weight percent, from about 50 weight percent to about 75 weight percent, from about 75 weight percent to about 85 weight percent, from about 85 weight percent to about 95 weight percent, or greater than about 95 weight percent, based on the total weight of the thermal transport layer. In one embodiment, thermally conductive material may be present in an amount of about 100 weight percent, based on the weight of the thermal transport layer. The amount may be adjusted, selected, or determined based on, for example, application specific parameters.",
        "The thermal transport layer may either be a continuous layer, or may include a plurality of individual thermally conductive strips that may be disposed in an alternating array with a plurality of individual non-thermally conductive strips having a relatively low thermal conductivity. Depending on the availability of the material and the thermal requirements of a system alternatively, the thermal transport layer may be employed in the thermal transport structure in various other forms, such as blocks, bars, cylinders, geometric shapes such as hexagons, and the like. For example, more thermal transport will require relatively larger cross section of the thermal transport layer.",
        "In some embodiments of the invention, the thickness of the thermal transport layer may be in a range of from about 250 micrometers to about 500 micrometers, from about 500 micrometers to about 750 micrometers, from about 750 micrometers to about 1000 micrometers, from about 1000 micrometers to about 1500 micrometers, from about 1500 micrometers to about 2000 micrometers, or greater than about 2000 micrometers. In cases where the thermal transport layer is not continuous, the individual portions may have differing thickness. The thickness of these individual portions may differ from each other, and may be in a range of from about 100 micrometers to about 200 micrometers, from about 200 micrometers to about 240 micrometers, from about 240 micrometers to about 260 micrometers, from about 260 micrometers to about 300 micrometers, from about 300 micrometers to about 350 micrometers, from about 350 micrometers to about 500 micrometers, or greater than about 500 micrometers. The thickness of the thermal transport layer may be selected with reference to the system requirements, such as heat generation and operating temperatures.",
        "The thickness of the thermal transport layer may be calculated based upon the required thickness of the thermal transport structure, which in turn may depend on factors, such as the dimensions of the devices, and the types of heat-generating and heat-dissipating devices. Further, the thickness of the thermal transport layer may also be based upon the overall thermal resistance requirement of the thermal transport structure. The thermal resistance of the thermal transport structure may depend upon the thermal resistance of the thermal transport layer as well as the resin layer. In some embodiments, the bulk resistance of the thermal transport layer having a thickness of about 1000 micrometers, or less, may be about 1 mm2-K/w; of about 500 micrometers, or less, may be about 1 mm2-K/w; or of about 1000 micrometers, or less, may be about 5 mm2-K/w.",
        "In some embodiments of the invention, the thermal transport layer may also include a binder. The binder may facilitate one or more of adhesion between a resin layer and the thermal transport layer, cohesion of the thermal transport layers, water resistance, and the like. Suitable binders may include the materials disclosed herein for use as the resin layer. In one embodiment, the binder may include one or more oxirane, such as an epoxy. The binder may be selected based on compatibility (or in some cases its incompatibility) with the resin layer. Where distinct layer boundary definitions may be desirable, incompatible or non-miscible materials may be used as the binder and the resin layer.",
