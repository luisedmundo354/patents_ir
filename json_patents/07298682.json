        "Optical recording media typified by the CD and the DVD have been widely used as recording media for recording digital data. The recording capacity demanded of such optical recording media has increased year by year, and various proposals have been made to achieve this. One of these proposals is a technique that uses a two-layer structure for the information recording layers contained in the optical recording media, which has found practical application in the DVD-Video and DVD-ROM formats which are read-only optical storage media. With such read-only optical recording media, pre-pits formed on the substrate surface become the information recording layer, and such substrates have a laminated structure with an intervening intermediate layer.",
        "In addition, in recent years, proposals have been made for optical recording media with a two-layer structure for the information recording layer to be used also as an optical recording medium in which data can be rewritten (data rewritable type optical recording medium) (See Japanese Patent Application Laid Open NO. 2001-273638). Such a data rewritable type optical recording medium has a structure in which a recording film and dielectric films between which they are sandwiched form an information recording layer, and these information recording layers are laminated.",
        "A phase change material is generally used for forming a recording film of a data rewritable type optical recording medium and data are recorded utilizing the difference in the reflection coefficients between the case where the recording film is in a crystal phase and the case where it is in an amorphous phase. More specifically, in an unrecorded state, substantially the entire surface of the recording film is in a crystal phase and when data are recorded, the phase of a predetermined region of the recording film is changed to the amorphous phase to form a recording pit. The phase of the phase change material in the crystal phase can be changed to the amorphous phase by heating the phase change material to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point thereof and quickly cooling it. On the other hand, the phase change material in the amorphous phase can be crystallized by heating the phase change material to a temperature equal to or higher than the crystallization temperature thereof and gradually cooling it.",
        "Such heating and cooling can be performed by adjusting the power (output) of a laser beam. In other words, it is possible not only to record data in an unrecorded recording film but also to directly overwrite (direct-overwrite) a recording mark already formed in a region of the recording film with a different recording mark by modulating the intensity of the laser beam. Generally, the power of the laser beam is modulated in accordance with a pulse waveform having an amplitude between a recording power (Pw) and a bottom power (Pb) in order to heat the recording film to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point thereof and the power of the laser beam is set to the bottom power (Pb) in order to quickly cool the recording film. Further, in order to heat the recording film to a temperature equal to or higher than the crystallization temperature thereof and gradually cool it, the power of a laser beam is set to an erasing power (Pe). In this case, the erasing power (Pe) is set to a level at which the recording film is heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the crystallization temperature thereof and lower than the melting point thereof, thereby performing so-called solid phase erasing.",
        "Here, in a data rewritable type optical recording medium having two information recording layers, since data are recorded or reproduced by focusing a laser beam onto one of the information recording layers, in the case of recording data in or reproducing data from the information recording layer farther from the light incidence plane (hereinafter referred to as an \u201cL1 layer\u201d), a laser beam is projected thereonto via the information recording layer closer to the light incidence plane (hereinafter referred to as an \u201cL0 layer\u201d). Therefore, since it is necessary for the L0 layer to have a sufficiently high light transmittance, it is general for the L0 layer to include no reflective film or even if the L0 layer includes a reflective film, the thickness of the reflective film is set to be very thin.",
        "Since the L0 layer thus includes no reflective film or even if the L0 layer includes a reflective film, the thickness of the reflective film is set to be very thin in a data rewritable type optical recording medium having two information recording layers, the heat radiation characteristic of the L0 layer is lower than that of the L1 layer including a sufficiently thick reflective film and, therefore, re-crystallization of the phase change material tends to occur. More specifically, since metal is generally used as the material for forming a reflective film, heat generated in the L1 layer by irradiation with a laser beam can be quickly radiated through the reflective film having high thermal conductivity but since the L0 layer includes no reflective film or only a very thin reflective film, heat generated in the L0 layer by irradiation with a laser beam cannot be quickly radiated. A recording mark (an amorphous region) formed in the L0 layer is therefore deformed and a good signal cannot be reproduced.",
        "Particularly, in recent years, attempts have been made to record large quantities of data by setting the quotient (\u03bb/NA) of the wavelength \u03bb of the laser beam used for recording and/or reproducing divided by the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lens used to focus the laser beam to be equal to or shorter than 700 nm, for example, by setting the numerical aperture NA to 0.7 or greater, e.g. roughly 0.85, and also shortening the wavelength \u03bb of the laser beam to about 200 to 450 nm in order to make the focused spot diameter of the laser beam smaller and increase the recording density. In such a system that records and/or reproduces data using a laser beam of short wavelength converged by an objective lens having a high NA, the above mentioned influence of thermal interference becomes great in the L0 layer and the phase change material tends to be re-crystallized.",

Further, a moisture proof film may be provided between the reflective film 34 and the substrate 11 in order to prevent the reflective film 34 from being corroded. Materials usable for forming each of the first dielectric film 21 to the fourth dielectric film 33 can be used for forming the moisture proof film. Further, although the L0 layer 20 includes no reflective film, a thin reflective film having a thickness of about 3 to 15 nm may be provided in the L0 layer 20.

        "First, as shown in FIG. 2, a stamper 40 is used to perform injection molding of a substrate 11 having grooves 11a and lands 11b. Next, as shown in FIG. 5, the sputtering method is used to form, upon nearly the entire surface of the side of the substrate 11 on which the grooves 11a and the lands 11b are formed, a reflective film 34, a fourth dielectric film 33, an L1 recording film 32 and a third dielectric film 34 in this order, thereby forming an L1 layer 30. Here, the phase of the L1 recording film 32 is normally in an amorphous phase immediately after the sputtering is completed.",
        "Next, as shown in FIG. 4, ultraviolet curable acrylic resin is spin-coated onto the L1 layer 30, and by shining an ultraviolet ray through a stamper 41 in the state with its surface covered with the stamper 41, an intermediate layer 12 having grooves 12a and lands 12b is formed. Next, as shown in FIG. 7, the sputtering method is used to form, upon nearly the entire surface of the intermediate layer 12 on which the grooves 11a and the lands 11b are formed, a second dielectric film 23, an L0 recording film 22 and a first dielectric film 21 in this order. Thus, an L0 layer 20 is completed. Here, the phase of the L0 recording film 22 is normally in an amorphous phase immediately after the sputtering is completed.",
        "Moreover, as shown in FIG. 1, ultraviolet curable acrylic resin is spin-coated onto the L0 layer 20, and by shining an ultraviolet ray, a light transmission layer 13 is formed. This completes all film deposition steps. In this specification, the optical recording medium in the state with the film deposition steps complete may also be called the \u201coptical recording medium precursor.\u201d",
        "Next, the optical recording medium precursor is placed upon the rotary table of a laser irradiation apparatus (not shown) and rotated while being continuously irradiated with a rectangular laser beam having a shorter length in the direction along the track and a longer length in the direction perpendicular to the track. By shifting the irradiation position in the direction perpendicular to the track each time the optical recording medium precursor makes one revolution, the rectangular laser beam can be shined over nearly the entire surface of the L0 recording film 22 and the L1 recording film 32. Thereby, the phase change material making up the L0 recording film 22 and the L1 recording film 32 is heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the crystallization temperature thereof and then cooled slowly, so the entire surface of the L0 recording film 22 and the L1 recording film 32 is put into the crystalline state, namely the unrecorded state. This process is called \u201can initializing process\u201d in this specification.",
        "When the initializing process is completed, the optical recording medium 10 is competed.",

        "As shown in FIGS. 6(a) to (d), in this embodiment, when data are to be recorded in the L0 recording film 22 or the L1 recording film 32, the power of a laser beam is modulated between three levels (three values) of a recording power (Pw), an erasing power (Pe) and a bottom power (Pb). The level of the recording power (Pw) is set to such a high level that the L0 recording film 22 or the L1 recording film 32 can be melted by the irradiation with the laser beam and is set to Pw0 when data are to be recorded in the L0 recording film 22 and Pw1 when data are to be recorded in the L1 recording film 32. The level of the erasing power (Pe) is set to such a level that the L0 recording film 22 or the L1 recording film 32 can be heated to a temperature equal to or higher than a crystallization temperature thereof and is set to Pe0 with respect to data recorded in the L0 recording film 22 and Pe1 with respect to data recorded in the L1 recording film 32. The level of the bottom power (Pb) is set to such a low level that the melted L0 recording film 22 or L1 recording film 32 can be cooled even if it is irradiated with the laser beam and is set to Pb0 when data are to be recorded in the L0 recording film 22 and Pb1 when data are to be recorded in the L1 recording film 32.",
        "The details of the recording power (Pw0, Pw1), the erasing power (Pe0, Pe1) and the bottom power (Pb0, Pb1) will be described later. Hereinafter, a reference to simply the recording power (Pw), erasing power (Pe) or bottom power (Pb) means the recording power (Pw0), erasing power (Pe0) or bottom power (Pb0) when data are to be recorded in the L0 recording film 22 and means the recording power (Pw1), erasing power (Pe1) or bottom power (Pb1) when data are to be recorded in the L1 recording film 32.",
        "First, as shown in FIG. 6(a), in the case of recording a 2T signal in the L0 recording film 22 or the L1 recording film 32, the number of pulses is set to 1 and a cooling interval Tcl is inserted thereafter. Here, the number of pulses is defined by the number of times the power of the laser beam is raised to the recording power (Pw). Further, in this specification, a first pulse is defined as a top pulse, a final pulse is defined as a last pulse and any pulse present between the top pulse and the last pulse is defined as a multi-pulse. However, in the case where the number of pulses is set to 1 as shown in FIG. 6(a), the pulse is the top pulse.",
        "At the cooling interval Tcl, the power of a laser beam is set to the bottom power (Pb). In this manner, in this specification, a last interval during which the power of a laser beam is set to the bottom power (Pb) is defined as the cooling interval. Therefore, in the case of recording a 2T signal, the power of the laser beam is set to the erasing power (Pe) before the time t11, set to the recording power (Pw) during the period (Ttop) from the time t11 to the time t12, set to the bottom power (Pb) during the period (Tcl) from the time t12 to the time t13 and set to the erasing power (Pe) after the time t13.",
        "Further, as shown in FIG. 6(b), in the case of recording a 3T signal in the L0 recording film 22 or the L1 recording film 32, the number of pulses is set to 2 and a cooling interval is inserted thereafter. Therefore, in the case of recording a 3T signal, the power of the laser beam is set to the erasing power (Pe) before the time t21, set to the recording power (Pw) during the period (Ttop) from the time t21 to the time t22 and the period (Tlp) from the time t23 to the time t24, set to the bottom power (Pb) during the period (Toff) from the time t22 to the time t23 and the period (Tcl) from the time t24 to the time t25 and set to the erasing power (Pe) after the time t25.",
        "Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 6(c), in the case of recording a 4T signal in the L0 recording film 22 or the L1 recording film 32, the number of pulses is set to 3 and a cooling interval is inserted thereafter. Therefore, in the case of recording a 4T signal, the power of the laser beam is set to the erasing power (Pe) before the time t31, set to the recording power (Pw) during the period (Ttop) from the time t31 to the time t32, the period (Tmp) from the time t33 to the time t34 and the period (Tlp) from the time t35 to the time t36, set to the bottom power (Pb) during the period (Toff) from the time t32 to the time t33, the period (Toff) from the time t34 to the time t35 and the period (Tcl) from the time t36 to the time t37 and set to the erasing power (Pe) after the time t37.",
        "In addition, as shown in FIG. 6(d), in the case of recording any one of a 5T signal to an 8T signal in the L0 recording film 22 or the L1 recording film 32, the number of pulses is correspondingly set to one of 4 to 7 and a cooling interval Tcl is inserted thereafter. Therefore, the number of multi-pulses is set to 2 to 5 correspondingly to a 5T signal to an 8T signal. In this case, the power of the laser beam is set to the recording power (Pw) during the period Ttop from the time t41 to the time t42, the periods Tmp corresponding to those from the time t43 to the time t44, from the time t45 to the time t46 and the like and the period Tlp from the time t47 to the time t48, set to the bottom power (Pb) during the off periods Toff corresponding to those from the time t42 to the time t43, from the time t46 to the time t47 and the like and the cooling interval Tcl from the time t48 to the time t49, and set to the erasing power (Pe) during the other periods.",
        "As a result, at a region where one of recording signals among a 2T signal to a 8T signal is to be recorded, the L0 recording film 22 or the L1 recording film 32 melted by the irradiation with the laser beam of the recording power (Pw1) is quickly cooled during the cooling interval Tcl and the phase thereof is changed to the amorphous phase. On the other hand, at the other regions, the L0 recording film 22 or the L1 recording film 32 is heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the crystallization temperature thereof and gradually cooled as the laser beam moves away, thereby being crystallized.",
        "Here, in the case of recording data in the L0 recording film 22, each of the pulse width Ttop of the top pulse, the pulse width Tmp of each of the multi-pulses, the pulse width Tlp of the last pulse and the cooling interval Tcl is set to be constant when any one of a 2T signal to a 8T signal is to be recorded. Hereinafter, the pulse width of the top pulse, the pulse width of each of the multi-pulses, the pulse width of the last pulse and the cooling interval in the case of recording data in the L0 recording film 22 are referred to as Ttop0, Tmp0, Tlpo and Tcl0. Similarly, in the case of recording data in the L1 recording film 32, each of the pulse width Ttop of the top pulse, the pulse width Tmp of each of the multi-pulses, the pulse width Tlp of the last pulse and the cooling interval Tcl is set to be constant when any one of a 2T signal to a 8T signal is to be recorded and, hereinafter, the pulse width of the top pulse, the pulse width of each of the multi-pulses, the pulse width of the last pulse and the cooling interval in the case of recording data in the L0 recording film 22 are referred to as Ttop1, Tmp1, Tlp1, and Tcl1. However, reference to simply Ttop, Tmp, Tlp or Tcl1 means Ttop0, Tmp0, Tlpo or Tcl0 when data are to be recorded in the L0 recording film 22 and means Ttop1, Tmp1, Tlp1 or Tcl1 when data are to be recorded in the L1 recording film 32.",
        "As described above, the L0 layer 20 is provided with no reflective layer or only a very thin reflective film (3 to 15 nm) even if it includes a reflective film, while the L1 layer 30 is provided with the reflective film 34 having a thickness of 20 to 200 nm. Therefore, the heat radiation characteristic of the L0 layer 20 is lower than that of the L1 layer 30 and the phase change material contained in the L0 layer 20 tends to be re-crystallized.",
        "In view of this, in this embodiment, in order to prevent the phase change material contained in the L0 layer 20 from being re-crystallized, the ratio (Pe0/Pw0) of the recording power (Pw0) and the erasing power (Pe0) when data are to be recorded in the L0 recording film 22 is set to be smaller than the ratio (Pe1/Pw1) of the recording power (Pw1) and the erasing power (Pe1) when data are to be recorded in the L1 recording film 32, thereby reducing thermal interference in the L0 layer 20 in which only a low cooling effect is obtained to suppress the re-crystallization of the phase change material contained in the L0 layer 20. In this case, if the ratio (Pe0/Pw0) is set too low with respect to the ratio (Pe1/Pw1), the erasing efficiency in the L0 layer 20 becomes low. On the other hand, if the ratio (Pe0/Pw0) is set to be too close to the ratio (Pe1/Pw1), thermal interference cannot be reduced in a desired manner and it is difficult to prevent the phase change material contained in the L0 layer 20 from being re-crystallized. Therefore, it is preferable to set the ratio (Pe0/Pw0) to be about 0.38 to 0.66 times the ratio (Pe1/Pw1), is more preferable to set it to be about 0.44 to 0.55 times the ratio (Pe1/Pw1) and is particularly preferable to set it to be about 0.50 times the ratio (Pe1/Pw1). If the relationship between the ratio (Pe0/Pw0) and the ratio (Pe1/Pw1) is set in this manner, the erasing efficiency can be maintained within a suitable range for practical use and thermal interference can be effectively reduced.",
        "However, when data are to be recorded in the L1 recording film 32, since the laser beam is projected onto the L1 recording film 32 via the L0 layer 20, the laser beam has been considerably attenuated when it reaches the L1 recording film 32. Therefore, in order to sufficiently melt the L1 recording film 32, it is necessary to set the recording power (Pw1) to be higher than the recording power (Pw0) used for recording data in the L0 recording film 22, namely, Pw0<Pw1.",
        "Further, in this embodiment, in order to prevent the phase change material contained in the L0 layer 20 from being re-crystallized, the pulse width Ttop0 of the top pulse when data are to be recorded in the L0 layer 20 is set to be shorter than the pulse width Ttop1 of the top pulse when data are to be recorded in the L1 layer 30, thereby further reducing thermal interference in the L0 layer 20 in which only a low cooling effect is obtained to more effectively suppress the re-crystallization of the phase change material contained in the L0 layer 20. In this case, if the pulse width Ttop0 is set too short with respect to the pulse width Ttop1, there is a risk of the L0 recording film 22 not being heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point thereof. On the other hand, if the pulse width Ttop0 is set close to the pulse width Ttop1, thermal interference cannot be reduced in a desired manner and it is difficult to prevent the phase change material contained in the L0 layer 20 from being re-crystallized. Therefore, it is preferable to set the pulse width Ttop0 to be about 0.40 to 0.75 times the pulse width Ttop1, is more preferable to set it to be about 0.49 to 0.55 times the pulse width Ttop1 and is particularly preferable to set it to be about 0.55 times the pulse width Ttop1. If the relationship between the pulse width Ttop0 and the pulse width Ttop1 is set in this manner, it is possible to reliably heat the L0 recording film 22 to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point thereof and thermal interference can be effectively reduced. Here, the pulse widths of Tlp0 and Tlp1 can be set to be equal to the pulse widths Ttop0 and Ttop1.",
        "Furthermore, in this embodiment, in order to prevent the phase change material contained in the L0 layer 20 from being re-crystallized, the pulse width Tmp0 of each of the multi-pulses when data are to be recorded in the L0 layer 20 is set to be shorter than the pulse width Tmp1 of each of the multi-pulses when data are to be recorded in the L1 layer 30, thereby further reducing thermal interference in the L0 layer 20 in which only a low cooling effect is obtained to more effectively suppress the re-crystallization of the phase change material contained in the L0 layer 20. In this case, if the pulse width Tmp0 is set too short with respect to the pulse width Tmp1, there is a risk of the L0 recording film 22 not being heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point thereof. On the other hand, if the pulse width Tmp0 is set close to the pulse width Tmp1, thermal interference cannot be reduced in a desired manner and it is difficult to prevent the phase change material contained in the L0 layer 20 from being re-crystallized. Therefore, it is preferable to set the pulse width Tmp0 to be about 0.48 to 0.58 times the pulse width Tmp1, is more preferable to set it to be about 0.50 to 0.53 times the pulse width Tmp1 and is particularly preferable to set it to be about 0.50 times the pulse width Tmp1. If the relationship between the pulse width Tmp0 and the pulse width Tmp1 is set in this manner, it is possible to reliably heat the L0 recording film 22 to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point thereof and thermal interference can be effectively reduced.",
        "Moreover, in this embodiment, in order to prevent the phase change material contained in the L0 layer 20 from being re-crystallized, the cooling interval Tcl0 when data are to be recorded in the L0 layer 20 is set to be longer than the cooling interval Tcl1 when data are to be recorded in the L1 layer 30, thereby further reducing thermal interference in the L0 layer 20 in which only a low cooling effect is obtained to more effectively suppress the re-crystallization of the phase change material contained in the L0 layer 20. In this case, if the cooling interval Tcl0 is set too long with respect to the cooling interval Tcl1, the erasing efficiency in the L0 recording film 22 becomes low. On the other hand, if the cooling interval Tcl0 is set close to the cooling interval Tcl1, thermal interference cannot be reduced in a desired manner and it is difficult to prevent the phase change material contained in the L0 layer 20 from being re-crystallized. Therefore, it is preferable to set the cooling interval Tcl0 to be about 1.25 to 2.00 times the cooling interval Tcl1, is more preferable to set it to be about 1.25 to 1.50 times the cooling interval Tcl1 and is particularly preferable to set it to be about 1.25 times the cooling interval Tcl1. If the relationship between the cooling interval Tcl0 and the cooling interval Tcl1 is set in this manner, the erasing efficiency can be maintained within a suitable range for practical use and thermal interference can be effectively reduced.",
        "It is preferable to store \u201crecording condition setting information\u201d in the optical recording medium 10 as information for identifying the pulse train patterns for the L0 recording film 22 and the L1 recording film 32. If such recording condition setting information is stored in the optical recording medium 10, the recording condition setting information is read by an information recording apparatus when data are actually recorded in the optical recording medium 10 by the user, and the pulse train patterns can be determined based on the thus read recording condition setting information. Therefore, for example, when the user requests recording of data in the L0 layer 20, the information recording apparatus sets the recording power, the erasing power and the bottom power to Pw0, Pe0 and Pb0, respectively, sets the pulse width of the top pulse, the pulse width of each of the multi-pulses, the pulse width of the last pulse and the cooling interval to Ttop0, Tmp0, Tlp0 and Tcl0, respectively, and records data in the L0 recording film 22. On the other hand, when the user requests recording of data in the L1 layer 30, the information recording apparatus sets the recording power, the erasing power and the bottom power to Pw1, Pe1 and Pb1, respectively, sets the pulse width of the top pulse, the pulse width of each of the multi-pulses, the pulse width of the last pulse and the cooling interval to Ttop1, Tmp1, Tlp1 and Tcl1, respectively, and records data in the L1 recording film 32.",
        "It is more preferable for the recording condition setting information to include not only information required for identifying the pulse train patterns for the L0 recording film 22 and the L1 recording film 32 but also information required for identifying various conditions such as the linear recording velocity required to record data in the optical recording medium 10. The recording condition setting information may be recorded in the optical recording medium 10 as a wobble signal or pre-pits, or it may be recorded as data in the L0 recording film 22 and/or the L1 recording film 32. Further, the recording condition setting information may include not only information directly indicating various conditions required to record data but also information capable of indirectly identifying the pulse train patterns by specifying any of various conditions stored in the information recording apparatus in advance.",

        "Moreover, as shown in FIG. 7, the controller 54 includes a focusing servo circuit 57, a tracking servo circuit 58, and a laser control circuit 59. When the focusing servo circuit 57 is activated, the focus is aligned with the recording surface of the rotating optical recording medium 10, and when the tracking servo circuit 58 is activated, the spot of the laser beam begins to automatically track the eccentric signal track of the optical recording medium 10. The focusing servo circuit 57 and tracking servo circuit 58 are provided with an auto gain control function for automatically adjusting the focusing gain and an auto gain control function for automatically adjusting the tracking gain, respectively. In addition, the laser control circuit 59 is a circuit that generates the laser driving signal supplied by the laser driving circuit 55 and generates a laser driving signal based on recording condition setting information recorded on the optical recording medium 10.",
        "Note that the focusing servo circuit 57, tracking servo circuit 58 and laser control circuit 59 need not be circuits incorporated in the controller 54 but can instead be components separate of the controller 54. Moreover, they need not be physical circuits but can instead be accomplished by software programs executed in the controller 54.",
        "In the case of recording data in the optical recording medium 10 using the thus constituted information recording apparatus 50, as described above, the recording condition setting information recorded in the optical recording medium 10 is read and pulse train patterns are determined based on the thus read recording condition setting information. Therefore, in the case of recording data in the L0 layer 20, the information recording apparatus 50 uses the thus read recording condition setting information to set the recording power, the erasing power and the bottom power to Pw0, Pe0 and Pb0, respectively and set the pulse width of the top pulse, the pulse width of each of the multi-pulses, the pulse width of the last pulse and the cooling interval to Ttop0, Tmp0, Tlp0 and Tcl0, respectively, and then records data in the L0 recording film 22.
