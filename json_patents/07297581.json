        "The escalating demands for high density and performance associated with ultra large scale integration semiconductor devices require design features, such as gate lengths, below 100 nanometers (nm), high reliability, and increased manufacturing throughput. The reduction of design features below 100 nm challenges the limitations of conventional methodology.",
        "Double-gate MOSFETs represent devices that are candidates for succeeding existing planar MOSFETs. In double-gate MOSFETs, the use of two gates to control the channel significantly suppresses short-channel effects. A FinFET is a double-gate structure that includes a channel formed in a vertical fin. Although a double-gate structure, the FinFET is similar to existing planar MOSFETs in layout and fabrication techniques. The FinFET also provides a range of channel lengths, CMOS compatibility, and large packing density compared to other double-gate structures.",

The method may further include performing a first tilt angle implant process to dope a first pair of the multiple fin structures with n-type impurities and performing a second tilt angle implant process to dope a second pair of the multiple fin structures with p-type impurities.",
        "According to a further aspect, a method may include forming a first fin and a second fin substantially parallel to one another, the first fin and the second fin having a first width and being located a first distance from one another. The method may further include forming a third fin and a fourth fin substantially parallel to one another, the third and fourth fin having the first width and being located a second distance from one another, where the second fin and the third fin are formed substantially parallel to one another and located a third distance from one another and where the third distance is greater than the first distance and the second distance. The method may also include forming a cap on each of the first, second, third and fourth fins. The method may additionally include implanting, at a first tilt angle, first vertical surfaces of the first and third fins with n-type impurities and implanting, at a second tilt angle, first vertical surfaces of the second and fourth fins with p-type impurities.",

SOI 100 may include a buried oxide layer on a silicon substrate (collectively shown in FIG. 1 as substrate 110) and a silicon layer 120 formed on the buried oxide layer. In alternative implementations, substrate 110 and layer 120 may include other semiconductor materials, such as germanium, or combinations of semiconductor materials, such as silicon-germanium. The buried oxide layer may include a silicon oxide or other types of dielectric materials.",
        "Silicon layer 120 may be formed on substrate 110 using a conventional deposition technique. The thickness of silicon layer 120 may range from about 50 \u212b to 500 \u212b. In an exemplary implementation, silicon layer 120 may be deposited to a thickness of approximately 50 \u212b. It will be appreciated that silicon layer 120 may be used to form one or more fins.",
        "A thick cap layer 130 (or hard mask) may be formed on top of silicon layer 120 to aid in pattern optimization and protect silicon layer 120 during subsequent processing. Cap layer 130 may, for example, include a silicon nitride material or some other type of material capable of protecting silicon layer 120 during the fabrication process. Cap layer 130 may be deposited, for example, by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to a thickness ranging from approximately 50 \u212b to 200 \u212b. In an exemplary implementation, cap layer 130 may be deposited to a thickness of approximately 50 \u212b.",

Silicon layer 120 may then be etched using well-known etching techniques to form multiple fin structures 210A, 2101B, 220A and 220B, as illustrated in FIG. 2A. FIG. 2B shows a three dimensional view of FIG. 2A.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, fin structure 210A/220A includes a fin 212A/222A and a cap 214A/224A and fin structure 210B/220B includes a fin 212B/222B and a cap 214B/224B. Caps 214A/224A may remain covering fin 212A/222A and caps 214B/224B may remain covering fin 212B/222B. The width of fin structures 210A, 220A, 210B and 220B may range from approximately 50 \u212b to 500 \u212b. In an exemplary implementation, the width of each of fin structures 210A, 220A, 210B and 220B may be approximately 50 \u212b. A distance d1 between side surfaces of fin structure 210A and fin structure 220A and between side surfaces of fin structure 210B and 220B may be approximately twice the width of fin structures 210A and 220A. d1 may, thus, range from approximately 100 \u212b to 1000 \u212b. A distance d2 between side surfaces of fin structure 220A and 210B may be approximately four times the width of fin structures 220A and 210B. d2 may, thus, range from approximately 200 \u212b to 2000 \u212b. In one implementation, for example, the distance d1 may be approximately 100 \u212b and the distance d2 may be approximately 200 \u212b.",
        "A tilt angle implant process may then be performed to dope fins 212A, 212B, 222A and 222B. For example, a conventional implant process of n-type impurities, such as arsenic or phosphorus, may be performed to dope fins 212A and 212B, as illustrated in FIG. 3A. FIG. 3B shows a three dimensional view of FIG. 3A. As shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, n-type impurities may be implanted at an angle ranging from approximately 40 degrees to 50 degrees. In an exemplary implementation, the implant process may be performed at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. The particular angle used may be dependent upon the height of cap 214/224. For example, if the height of cap 214/224 is approximately equal to the height of fin 212/222, then the angle used may be less than or equal to 45 degrees.",
        "The n-type impurities may be implanted at a dosage of about 5\u00d71014 atoms/cm2 to about 1\u00d71015 atoms/cm2 and an implantation energy of about 3-6 KeV for phosphorus or about 5-10 KeV for arsenic, which may depend on the thickness of fin 212. After the implant process is complete, fins 212A and 212B may include silicon doped predominately, or only, with n-type impurities, as illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 3B.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, the implanting of n-type impurities does not dope fins 222A and 222B. There are several factors that aid in preventing the n-type impurities from reaching fins 222A and 222B. For example, the presence, height, and closeness of fin structure 210 shields or shadows fin 222, thereby blocking the n-type impurities from reaching fin 222. The presence of cap 224 also helps block the n-type impurities.",
        "A tilt angle implant process of p-type impurities, such as boron or BF2, may be performed to dope fins 222A and 222B, as illustrated in FIG. 4A. FIG. 4B shows a three dimensional view of FIG. 4A. As shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B, p-type impurities may be implanted at an angle ranging from approximately 40 degrees to 50 degrees. In an exemplary implementation, the implant process may be performed at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. The particular angle used may be dependent upon the height of cap 214/224. For example, if the height of cap 214/224 is approximately equal to the height of fin 212/222, then the angle used may be less than or equal to 45 degrees.",
        "The p-type impurities may be implanted at a dosage of about 5\u00d71014 atoms/cm2 to about 1\u00d71015 atoms/cm2 and an implantation energy of about 2 KeV to about 3 KeV for boron, which may depend on the thickness of fin 222. After the implant process is complete, fins 222A and 222B may include silicon doped predominately, or only, with p-type impurities, as illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4B.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B, the implanting of p-type impurities does not dope fins 212A and 212B. There are several factors that aid in preventing the p-type impurities from reaching fins 212A and 212B. For example, the presence, height, and closeness of fin structure 220 shields or shadows fin 212 blocks the p-type impurities from reaching fin 212. The presence of cap 224 also helps block the p-type impurities.",
        "It may also be desirable to dope fins 212 and 222 from the other side (i.e., the sides of fins 212 and 222 facing each other). This may be desirable in instances where the dopant does not fully dope fins 212 and 222.",
        "In this case, a hardened resist may optionally be formed on non-shadowed sides of fin structures 210 and 220. Another group of tilt angle implant processes may then optionally be performed to dope fins 212A, 212B, 222A and 222B. For example, a hardened resist 510 may be formed on the non-shadowed side surface of fin structure 220, as illustrated in FIG. 5A. FIG. 5B shows a three dimensional view of FIG. 5A. Resist 510 may be formed to a thickness ranging from approximately 100 \u212b to 200 \u212b. In an exemplary implementation, resist 510 may be formed to a thickness of approximately 150 \u212b. While FIG. 5B shows resist 510 covering only a portion of fin structure 220, resist 510 may be formed to cover the entire non-shadowed side of fin structure 220.",
        "A conventional implant process of n-type impurities, such as arsenic or phosphorus, may be performed to dope fins 212A and 212B, as illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 5B. The n-type impurities may be implanted at an angle ranging from approximately 40 degrees to 50 degrees. In an exemplary implementation, the implant process may be performed at an angle of approximately 45 degrees.",
        "The n-type impurities may be implanted at a dosage of about 5\u00d71014 atoms/cm2 to about 1\u00d71015 atoms/cm2 and an implantation energy of about 3-6 KeV for phosphorus or about 5-10 KeV for arsenic, which may depend on the thickness of fin 212. After the implant process is complete, fins 212A and 212B may include silicon doped predominately, or only, with n-type impurities, as illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 5B. The implanting of n-type impurities does not dope fins 222A and 222B. For example, resist 510 and cap 224 block the n-type impurities from reaching fins 222A and 222B.",
        "A hardened resist 610 may optionally be formed on the non-shadowed side surface of fin structures 212A and 212B, as illustrated in FIG. 6A. FIG. 6B shows a three dimensional view of FIG. 6A. Resist 610 may be formed to a thickness ranging from approximately 100 \u212b to 200 \u212b. In an exemplary implementation, resist 610 may be formed to a thickness of approximately 150 \u212b. While FIG. 6B shows resist 610 covering only a portion of fin structures 210A and 210B, resist 610 may be formed to cover the entire non-shadowed side of fin structures 210A and 210B.",
        "A conventional implant process of p-type impurities, such as boron or BF2, may then be optionally performed to dope fins 222A and 222B, as illustrated in FIGS. 6A and 6B. The p-type impurities may be implanted at an angle ranging from approximately 40 degrees to 50 degrees. In an exemplary implementation, the implant process may be performed at an angle of approximately 45 degrees.",
        "The p-type impurities may be implanted at a dosage of about 5\u00d71014 atoms/cm2 to about 1\u00d71015 atoms/cm2 and an implantation energy of about 2 KeV to about 3 KeV for boron, which may depend on the thickness of fins 222A and 222B. After the implant process is complete, fins 222A and 222B may include silicon doped predominately, or only, with p-type impurities, as illustrated in FIGS. 6A and 6B. The implanting of p-type impurities does not dope fins 212A and 212B. For example, resist 610 and cap 214 block the p-type impurities from reaching fin 212.",
        "After doping of fins 212A, 212B, 222A and 222B, conventional FinFET fabrication processing can be used to complete the transistor (e.g., forming the source and drain regions, contacts, interconnects and inter-level dielectrics for the FinFET device). For example, any remaining resist 510 or 610 may be stripped. Also, caps 214 and 224 may be removed.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 7, a selective oxide strip 710 may be grown on fins 212A and 222A. Oxide strip 710 maybe etched and a gate 720 and M1 jumper 730 maybe formed by depositing and patterning polysilicon over fins 212A, 222A, 212B and 222B, as illustrated in FIG. 7. Polysilicon may then be deposited and patterned for forming the contacts and interconnect 810, as illustrated in FIG. 8.",
        "Conventional processing may then be performed to complete the SRAM device. FIG. 9 illustrates a FinFET SRAM device 900 that may be formed from the above-processing. As illustrated, SRAM device 900 includes a group of separate M2 bitline contacts 910, an M1 wordline 920, an M1 jumper 730, a gate 720, and a gate interconnect 810.",
        "Systems and methods consistent with the principles of the invention provide tightly spaced n-channel and p-channel fins for a SRAM cell. In implementations consistent with the present invention, the fins may be doped using shadowed implant techniques.",
        "The foregoing description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practice of the invention.",
        "For example, in the above descriptions, numerous specific details are set forth, such as specific materials, structures, chemicals, processes, etc., in order to provide a thorough understanding of implementations consistent with the present invention.
