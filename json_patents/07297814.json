        "This is a divisional of Ser. No. 10/887,868, filed Jul. 12, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,144,557, which is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/JP03/00160 filed Jan. 10, 2003.",
        "The present invention relates to a multitube reactor applied to a method of producing (meth)acrolein and/or (meth)acrylic acid by oxidizing propylene, propane, isobutylene, isobutanol, or t-butanol with a molecular oxygen-containing gas, a vapor phase catalytic oxidation method using the multitube reactor, and to a start up method applied to the multitube reactor.",
        "A conventional multitube reactor is equipped with a plurality of reaction tubes having a catalyst packed therein and a plurality of baffles inside a shell for feeding and circulating inside the shell a fluid for heat removal (hereinafter, referred to as \u201cheat medium\u201d) introduced into the shell. A raw material gas fed inside the reaction tubes reacts in the presence of the catalyst inside the reaction tubes, to thereby generate heat of reaction. The heat of reaction is removed by a heat medium circulating inside the shell.",
        "When differences of inner volumes among the plurality of reaction tubes equipped inside the shell is large, amounts of the catalyst packed inside the reaction tubes are irregular and a scatter arises. As a result, a flow rate of the raw material gas fed or a retention time differs among the reaction tubes, thereby becoming a factor causing yield reduction of a target product and reduced catalyst life. Further, a localized abnormal high-temperature site (hot spot) may form in the reaction tubes provoking a reaction out of control, thereby causing a problem of inhibiting a continuous operation.",
        "Further, in a multitube reactor provided with the baffles, the heat medium does not flow at all in a portion where the baffles and the reaction tubes are fixed to each other when the baffles and the reaction tubes are fixed through welding, flanges, or the like. A reactor in which outer walls of the reaction tubes and the baffle are not fixed also exists, but the amount of the heat medium flowing through this clearance is limited. The following problems arise in a vapor phase catalytic oxidation method using a fixed bed multitube heat-exchanger type reactor as described above.",
        "There is a state of poor heat removal in the reaction tubes in a portion where flow of the heat medium is insufficient inside the shell. A localized abnormal high-temperature zone (hot spot) may form in the reaction tubes which are in a state of poor heat removal, possibly resulting in a reaction out of control. Further, a reaction may not become out of control, but problems arise including ease of clogging the reaction tubes, yield reduction of the reaction product gas, deterioration of the catalyst life, and inhibition of a stable operation for a long period of time.",
        "Many methods of suppressing hot spot formation have been proposed for the multitube reactor used in a vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction. For example, JP 08-092147 A discloses a method of providing uniform heat medium temperature by: setting a flow direction of a reactant gas guided to a reactor and that of the heat medium inside a shell in a countercurrent; allowing the heat medium to flow further upward in a meandering way using baffles; and adjusting temperature differences of the heat medium from an inlet of the reactor to an outlet thereof within 2 to 10\u00b0 C. or less.",
        "The multitube reactor generally consists of a plurality of tubes (bundle) arranged vertically, and thus a process fluid flow can be upflow or downflow by allowing a process fluid to flow from an upper portion or lower portion of the reactor. The heat medium can also be fed to the shell from the upper portion or lower portion thereof.",
        "Therefore, the multitube reactor is classified into two types similar to a general shell and tube heat exchanger: a concurrent type allowing the process fluid and the heat medium to flow in the same direction; and a countercurrent type allowing the process fluid and the heat medium to flow in opposite directions.",
        "Further, the multitube reactor may be classified into the following types considering the directions of the fluids: 1) a concurrent type of downflow process fluid/downflow heat medium; 2) a concurrent type of upflow process fluid/upflow heat medium; 3) a countercurrent type of upflow process fluid/downflow heat medium; and 4) a countercurrent type of downflow process fluid/upflow heat medium.",
        "Proposed in JP 2000-093784 A is a method of suppressing hot spot formation by: allowing a raw material gas and a heat medium to flow in downward concurrent; and preventing a gas reservoir free of the heat medium. Further, the method allows an exchange of a catalyst in a vicinity of a catalyst layer inlet alone where most easily deteriorates by: feeding the raw material gas from an upper portion of a reactor; and allowing the raw material gas to flow downward inside the catalyst layer of reaction tubes.",
        "However, the heat medium and the process fluid move in a concurrent according to the method, and gas temperature in an outlet portion of the reactor increases. Thus, the method has a fault that high concentration of a product (meth)acrolein easily causes an autooxidation reaction (autolysis reaction).",
        "Further, with respect to the upflow, in a method of allowing the process fluid and the heat medium to flow in a concurrent, that is in the same direction, heat medium temperature increases with heat of reaction. Thus, high temperature at a process outlet causes autooxidation at the reactor outlet easily. The autooxidation reaction results in problems of a combustion reaction of the product, equipment breakdown due to temperature increase, and yield reduction.",
        "Proposed is a method of preventing autooxidation for a purpose of preventing temperature increase, by providing a cooling zone or heat exchanger in a downstream of a reaction portion for decreasing gas temperature. However, in a concurrent, heat medium temperature in the vicinity of the reactor outlet and process gas temperature in an outlet portion are high. Thus, an amount of heat removal becomes large and a cooling portion (cooling zone and heat exchanger) enlarges, thereby becoming disadvantageous in point of cost.",
        "Further, even if a significant autooxidation reaction is not caused, an autooxidation reaction is caused by a part of a product, which arises a problem of yield reduction of a target product as a whole.",
        "Further, in a shell-tube type reactor circulating a heat medium which is solid at normal temperature, there is a necessary to maintain the heat medium at temperature of the solidifying point or above to ensure fluidity thereof for circulating the heat medium inside the reactor.",
        "JP 2001-310123 A discloses a-reactor start up method for a multitube reactor having reaction tubes, an introducing port of a fluid flowing outside reaction tubes, and a discharging port thereof for removing heat generated inside the reaction tubes, the method being characterized by including: heating reaction tubes by introducing a gas having temperature of 100 to 400\u00b0 C. in the reaction tubes; and circulating a heated heat medium through the outside of the reaction tubes. Further, a gas not providing an effect when being mixed with a catalyst packed in the reaction tubes or with a raw material gas (such as air) is selected as the gas introduced to the reaction tubes.",
        "However, a large volume of a high temperature gas is introduced to the reaction tubes according to the above-mentioned method, thereby changing an oxidation state of the catalyst. Therefore, catalytic activity and selectivity may be affected, possibly resulting in yield reduction or reduced catalyst life.",
        "A first object of the present invention is to provide a multitube reactor for improving life of a catalyst packed inside the reaction tubes and for preventing yield reduction of a target product.",
        "Further, a second object of the present invention is to provide a vapor phase catalytic oxidation method comprising: using the above-mentioned multitube reactor; circulating a heat medium through the outside of the reaction tubes; and feeding a reaction raw material gas inside the reaction tubes packed with a catalyst to obtain a reaction product gas, in which hot spot formation can be effectively prevented, the reaction tubes are not clogged, an yield of a reaction product gas is high, a catalyst life is long, and a stable operation can be performed over a long period of time.",
        "Further, a third object of the present invention is to reduce process gas temperature at a product discharging port of the reactor in the vapor phase catalytic oxidation method using the multitube reactor described above.",
        "Further, a fourth object of the present invention is to provide a method which makes a reactor start up effectively without adversely affecting the catalytic activity in a shell-tube type reactor of circulating a heat medium which is solid at normal temperature, the method being applied to a multitube reactor such as the above-mentioned multitube reactor.",

        "An outline of the multitube reactor of the present invention will be described with reference to FIG. 1.",
        "Reference numeral 2 represents a shell of the multitube reactor, and the shell 2 comprises reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c each packed with a catalyst, the reaction tubes being fixed by both a lower tube plate 5b and an upper tube plate 5a.",
        "The reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c each have an inner diameter of about 20 to 40 mm\u03a6, a wall-thickness of 1 to 2 mm, and a length of 3,000 to 6,000 mm. A carbon steel tube or stainless steel tube is used as a material for each of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c.",
        "The total number of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c equipped inside the shell 2 varies depending on the amount of production of a target product but: is typically 1,000 to 30,000. The arrangement of the tubes varies depending on outside diameter sizes of the reaction tubes, but the reaction tubes equipped inside the shell at intervals of 5 to 50 mm to establish a square arrangement or an equilateral triangle arrangement.",
        "The above equilateral triangle arrangement is often used because the arrangement can increase the number of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c equipped inside the reactor per unit area.",
        "The outside diameter tolerance and wall-thickness tolerance of each of the reaction tubes used in the present invention are far more rigorous than the tolerance of JIS or of ASTM, and such tubes that satisfy the rigorous tolerances are used.",
        "That is, each of the reaction tubes is desirably selected from tube products having the same nominal outside diameter and the same nominal wall-thickness, an outside diameter tolerance of \u00b10.62% and a wall-thickness tolerance of +19% to \u22120%, particularly preferably an outside diameter tolerance of \u00b10.56% and a wall-thickness tolerance of +17% to \u22120%. In the multitube reactor of the present invention, all the reaction tubes equipped inside the multitube reactor preferably satisfy the above conditions. However, it is sufficient that at least 95%, more preferably at least 99% of the tubes satisfy the above conditions.",
        "The shell 2 has, at its top and bottom ends, inlet and outlet portions 4a and 4b for a raw material gas Rg for a reaction, and the raw material gas Rg flows through the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c in an upward or downward flow direction via the inlet and outlet portions 4a and 4b for the raw material gas arranged on the top and bottom ends of the reactor. The flow direction of the raw material gas is not particularly limited, but is more preferably a downflow.",
        "In addition, a ring-shaped tube 3a for introducing a heat medium Hm is arranged on the outer periphery of the shell 2. The heat medium Hm pressurized by a circulating pump 7 is introduced into the shell 2 through the ring-shaped tube 3a.",
        "The heat medium Hm introduced into the shell 2 flows upward while changing its flow direction as indicated by arrows due to baffles 6a, 6b, and 6a equipped inside in the shell 2. During this period, the heat medium Hm contacts the outer surfaces of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c to remove heat of reaction, and then returns to the circulating pump 7 via the ring-shaped tube 3a arranged on the outer periphery of the shell 2.",
        "Part of the heat medium Hm absorbing the heat of reaction flows toward a discharge tube 8b arranged on an upper portion of the circulating pump 7 to be cooled by a heat exchanger (not shown). Then, the heat medium is sucked again in the circulating pump 7 through a heat medium feed tube 8a to be introduced into the shell 2.",
        "The temperature of the heat medium Hm introduced into the shell 2 is controlled by adjusting the temperature or quantity of flow of the heat medium flowing from the heat medium feed tube 8a. In addition, the temperature of the heat medium Hm is measured with a thermometer 14 inserted into the side of the inlet of the ring-shaped tube 3a.",
        "An inner body plate of each of the ring-shaped tube 3a and a ring-shaped tube 3b is equipped with a flow-rectifying plate (not shown) in order to minimize the flow rate distribution of the heat medium in a circumferential direction. A porous plate or a plate with slits is used for the flow-rectifying plate. The flow-rectifying plate is arranged in such a manner that the same quantity of flow of the heat medium Hm is introduced into the shell 2 at the same flow rate from the entire circumference by changing an opening area of the porous plate or by changing slit intervals.",
        "In addition, the temperature inside the ring-shaped tube 3a, preferably the temperature inside each of the ring-shaped tubes 3a and 3b, can be monitored with a plurality of thermometers 15 arranged at even interval along the circumference as shown in FIG. 4. 1 to 5 baffles are typically equipped inside the shell 2. In FIG. 1, 3 baffles (6a, 6b, and 6a) are equipped inside the shell 2. The presence of those baffles causes the flow of the heat medium Hm in the shell 2 to center on the central portion from the outer peripheral portion of the shell 2, to flow upward through an opening of the baffle 6a toward the outer peripheral portion while changing its direction, and then to reach the inner wall of the shell 2.",
        "Then, the heat medium Hm changes its direction again to converge to the central portion while flowing upward through a gap between the inner wall of the shell 2 and the outer periphery of the baffle 6b. Finally, the heat medium Hm flows upward through an opening of the baffle 6a toward the outer periphery along the bottom face of the upper tube plate 5a in the shell 2 to be introduced into the ring-shaped tube 3b. After that, the heat medium Hm is sucked in the circulating pump 7 to be circulated in the shell 2 again.",
        "The specific structure of a baffle used in the present invention may be any one of a segment-type noncircular baffle shown in FIG. 2 and a disc-type baffle shown in FIG. 3.",
        "Both types of baffles have the same relationship between the flow direction of a heat medium and the axis of a reaction tube.",
        "The baffle 6a has its outer periphery on the inner wall of the shell 2 and has an opening around its center. In addition, the outer periphery of the baffle 6b is smaller than the circumference of the inner wall of the shell 2 so that a gap is formed between the outer periphery of the baffle 6b and the inner wall of the shell 2.",
        "The heat medium changes its direction at each opening and gap while moving upward, and the flow rate is changed.",
        "Thermometers 11 are equipped inside the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c, which are equipped inside in the shell 2. Signals are transmitted from thermometers to the outside of the shell 2 to measure the temperature distribution of a catalyst layer packed inside a reaction tube in an axial direction of the reaction tube.",
        "A plurality of thermometers 11 are inserted into the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c to measure temperatures at 2 to 20 points in an axial direction.",
        "The reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c equipped inside the shell 2 are divided by the 3 baffles 6a, 6b, and 6c, and are classified into 3 types depending on the relationship with the flow direction of the heat medium Hm.",
        "That is, the reaction tube 1a is connected to the baffle 6b. Therefore, the flow direction of the heat medium Hm is restrained only by the baffle 6b. In addition, the flow direction is not restrained by the other two baffles 6a because the reaction tube 1a penetrates through opening portions of the two baffles 6a.",
        "The direction of the heat medium Hm introduced into the shell 2 through the ring-shaped tube 3a is changed as indicated by an arrow shown in FIG. 1 at the central portion of the shell 2. Furthermore, the reaction tube 1a is located at the position where the direction is changed, and thus the heat medium Hm that flows along the outer periphery of the reaction tube 1a mainly flows in parallel with the axis of the reaction tube 1a.",
        "The reaction tube 1b is connected to the 3 baffles 6a, 6b, and 6a so that the flow direction of the heat medium Hm is restrained by each of the baffles. In addition, the heat medium Hm flowing along the outer periphery of the reaction tube 1b flows at a right angle with the axis of the reaction tube 1b at nearly all positions of the reaction tube 1b. It should be noted that most of the reaction tubes equipped inside the shell 2 are located at the position of the reaction tube 1b.",
        "In addition, the reaction tube 1c is not connected to the baffle 6b and penetrates through a gap between the outer periphery of the baffle 6b and the inner wall of the shell 2. Therefore, the flow of the heat medium Hm is not restrained by the baffle 6b at this position and is parallel with the axis of the reaction tube 1c.",
        "FIG. 4 shows the positional relationship among the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c and the baffles 6a, 6b, and 6a, and the correlation of the flow of the heat medium Hm.",
        "When an opening portion (the most inner circle indicated by broken lines) of the baffle 6a is located at a converging position of the heat medium Hm, that is, the center of the shell 2, the flow of the heat medium Hm is parallel with-the reaction tube 1a. Moreover, nearly no heat medium Hm flows particularly at the center of the opening portion of the baffle 6a, and the flow rate is close to zero. In other words, heat transfer efficiency is extremely poor. Therefore, the reaction tube 1a is not provided at this position in some cases.",
        "FIG. 5 shows another-example of the present invention in which the shell 2 of the reactor is divided by an intermediate tube plate 9.",
        "Different heating media Hm1 and Hm2 are circulated in spaces obtained by dividing the shell 2 and the temperatures of the media are separately controlled.",
        "A raw material gas Rg is introduced through a raw material gas inlet 4a of the shell and is successively reacted to yield a product.",
        "Heat media having different temperatures are present in the shell, and hence how each of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c is packed with a catalyst is as follows. In a case (i), each reaction tube is entirely packed with the same catalyst and the temperature of the catalyst is changed at the inlet and outlet of the shell to allow a reaction. In a case (ii), a catalyst is packed at the inlet portion. For rapidly cooling a reaction product, no catalyst is packed at the outlet portion, that is, the outlet portion serves as a cavity or is packed with an inert substance without reaction activity. In a case (iii), different catalysts are packed at the inlet and outlet portions. For rapidly cooling a reaction product, no catalyst is packed at an intermediate portion or is packed with an inert substance without reaction activity.",
        "For example, when propylene or isobutylene is introduced as a mixed gas with a molecular oxygen-containing gas, propylene or isobutylene is converted into (meth)acrolein at an upper portion and is oxidized to (meth)acrylic acid at a lower portion.",
        "Different catalysts are packed in upper and lower portions in each of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c, and the temperatures of the catalysts are controlled to respective optimum temperatures, to thereby carry out a reaction. An inert substance layer that is not involved in the reaction may be present as a partition between the upper portion and the lower portion. In the case, the inert substance layer is provided in a portion corresponding to the position at which the outer periphery of each of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c is connected to the intermediate tube plate 9.",
        "In FIG. 6, reference numeral 9 represents an intermediate tube plate, and 3 thermal shields 10 are fixed at the bottom face of the intermediate tube plate 9 by spacer rods 13.",
        "As shown in the figure, 2 to 3 thermal shields 10 are provided within 100 mm below or above the intermediate tube plate 9, whereby preferably forming a flowless stagnant space 12 filled with the heat medium Hm1 or Hm2, to provide a heat insulation effect.",
        "Thermal shields 10 are attached to the intermediate tube plate 9 for the following reason. That is, in FIG. 5, when the difference in controlled temperature between the heat medium Hm1 introduced into the lower portion of the shell 2 and the heat medium Hm2 introduced into the upper portion of the shell 2 exceeds 100\u00b0 C., heat transfer from the high-temperature heat medium to the low-temperature heat medium cannot be neglected. Thus, the precision in controlling the reaction temperature of a catalyst may degrade at lower temperatures. In such a case, heat insulation is necessary to prevent heat transfer above and/or below the intermediate tube plate 9.",
        "Here, the types and ratios of raw material gas components and the importance of uniform packing of a catalyst will be described.",
        "Introduced into a multitube reactor for use in vapor phase catalytic oxidation is a mixed gas of propylene or isobutylene and/or (meth)acrolein with a molecular oxygen-containing gas or with water vapor as a raw material gas Rg for a reaction.",
        "The concentration of propylene or isobutylene ranges from 3 to 10 vol %. A molar ratio of oxygen to propylene or to isobutylene ranges from 1.5 to 2.5, and a molar ratio of water vapor to propylene or to isobutylene ranges from 0.8 to 2.0.",
        "The introduced raw material gas Rg is distributed to the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c and then flows through each reaction tube to react by an oxidation catalyst packed inside each reaction tube. However, the distribution of the raw material gas Rg to each reaction tube is affected by the packing weight, packing density, and the like of a catalyst in a reaction tube. The packing weight, packing density, and the like are set at the time of packing a catalyst into a reaction tube. Therefore, it is essential to uniformly pack a catalyst into each reaction tube.",
        "To uniformize the weight of a catalyst packed inside each reaction tube, it is important to set a rigorous tolerance of a reaction tube into which a catalyst is packed.",
        "The raw material gas Rg flowing through each of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c is initially heated to a reaction starting temperature while flowing through the inert substance layer packed at the inlet portion.",
        "The raw material (propylene or isobutylene) is oxidized by the catalyst packed as the successive layer in the reaction tube, and the temperature of the raw material further increases by heat of reaction.",
        "The reaction weight in the inlet portion of the catalyst layer is most. The heat of reaction generated increases the temperature of the raw material gas Rg when the heat of reaction is greater than the quantity of heat removal by the heat medium Hm. In such a case, hot spots may be formed. The hot spots are often formed at a position 300 to 1,000 mm from the inlet of each of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c.",
        "Here, the effect of the heat of reaction generated on a catalyst, the temperature of a heat medium and the allowable maximum temperature of hot spots when producing acrolein through an oxidation reaction of propylene with a molecular oxygen-containing gas, the type of heat medium used, and the effect of a fluid state of the heat medium on the heat removal efficiency of the heat medium will be described.",
        "When the heat of reaction generated exceeds the heat removal capacity of the heat medium Hm on the outer periphery of the corresponding reaction tube, the temperature of the raw material gas Rg further increases, and the heat of reaction also increases. Finally, the reaction becomes out of control. In this case, the temperature of the catalyst exceeds the allowable maximum temperature, so that the catalyst undergoes a qualitative change. This change may be a main cause for the deterionation or breakage of the catalyst.",
        "A description is given by taking as an example a former stage reactor (for instance, the portion of the reactor above the intermediate tube plate 9 in FIG. 5) in which acrolein is produced through an oxidation reaction of propylene with a molecular oxygen-containing gas. In this example, the temperature of the heat medium Hm is in the range of 250 to 350\u00b0 C. and the allowable maximum temperature of the hot spots is in the range of 400 to 500\u00b0 C.",
        "In addition, the temperature of the heat medium Hm in a latter stage reactor (for instance, the portion of the reactor below the intermediate tube plate 9 in FIG. 5) in which acrolein is oxidized by a molecular oxygen-containing gas to yield acrylic acid is in the range of 200 to 300\u00b0 C. and the allowable maximum temperature of the hot spots is in the range of 300 to 400\u00b0 C.",
        "Niter, a mixture of nitrates, is often used as the heat medium Hm that flows inside the shell 2 surrounding the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c. However, a phenyl ether heat medium of an organic liquid system may also be used.",
        "The heat medium Hm flows to remove heat from the outer periphery of each of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c. However, the heat medium Hm introduced into the shell 2 through the ring-shaped tube 3a for heat medium introduction flows toward the central portion from the outer peripheral portion of the shell 2 at a position and reverses its flow direction at another position. Heat removal effects at the positions were found to extremely differ from each other.",
        "A heat transfer coefficient of the heat medium when the flow direction of the heat medium Hm is at a right angle with the axis of a reaction tube is in the range of 1,000 to 2,000 W/m2\u00b0 C. When the flow direction is not at a right angle with the axis of a reaction tube, the heat transfer coefficient varies depending on the flow rate and on whether the flow is an upflow or a downflow. However, the heat transfer coefficient often falls within a narrow range of 100 to 300 W/m2\u00b0 C. when niter is used as the heat medium.",
        "On the other hand, the heat transfer coefficient of a catalyst layer in each of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c naturally dependents on the flow rate of the raw material gas Rg, but is about 100 W/m2\u00b0 C. As a matter of course, the rate determining factor of heat transfer is a gas phase in a tube as usual.",
        "Specifically, heat transfer resistance on the outer periphery of each of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c when the flow of the heat medium Hm is at a right angle with the axis of the tube is 1/10 to 1/20 that of the gas Rg in the tube. Therefore, a change in flow rate of the heat medium Hm hardly affects the overall heat transfer resistance.",
        "However, when niter flows in parallel with the axis of a tube, the heat transfer coefficient in each of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c is comparable to that outside the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c. Therefore, the effect of the fluid state at the outer periphery of the tube on the heat removal efficiency is large. That is, when the heat transfer resistance at the outer periphery of a tube is 100 W/m2\u00b0 C., the overall heat transfer coefficient becomes half. Furthermore, half the change in heat transfer resistance at the outer periphery of the tube affects the overall heat transfer coefficient.",
        "In each of FIGS. 1 and 5, the flow direction of the heat medium Hm in the shell 2 is represented as an upflow by arrows. However, the present invention can also be applied to the opposite flow direction.",
        "In determining the direction of a circulation flow of the heat medium Hm, a phenomenon of engulfing, in the heat medium flow, a gas that may be present at top ends of the shell 2 and the circulating pump 7, in particular an inert gas such as nitrogen, must be prevented.",
        "In the case where the heat medium Hm is an upflow as shown in FIG. 1, a cavitation phenomenon occurs in the circulating pump 7 when a gas is engulfed at an upper portion of the circulating pump 7. In the worst case, the pump may break.",
        "In the case where the heat medium Hm is a downflow, a gas engulfing phenomenon occurs also at an upper portion of the shell 2. In this case, a stagnant portion of a gas phase is formed at an upper portion of the shell 2, and an upper portion of a reaction tube corresponding to the gas stagnant portion is not cooled by the heat medium Hm.",
        "Prevention of gas stagnation must include: providing a degas line; and replacing a gas of the gas phase with the heat medium Hm. To achieve this, the pressure of the heat medium in the heat medium feed tube 8a is increased and the heat medium discharging tube 8b is provided at the highest position as possible to increase the pressure in the shell 2. The heat medium discharging tube 8b is provided at least above the upper tube plate 5a.",
        "The raw material gas Rg can be an upflow or a downflow in the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c. However, the raw material gas Rg preferably in a countercurrent in relation to the heat medium flow.",
        "Examples of a method of adjusting activity of a catalyst layer include: a method of adjusting catalyst compositions to use catalysts having different activities; and a method of adjusting activity by mixing catalyst particles with inert substance particles to dilute the catalyst.",
        "A catalyst layer having a small ratio of the catalyst particles is packed into an inlet portion of each of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c. A catalyst layer having a large ratio of the catalyst particles or catalyst layer not diluted is packed into a portion of the reaction tube, the portion located downstream with respect to the flow direction of the raw material gas. Although the degree of dilution varies by a catalyst, a (catalyst particles/inert substance particles) mixing ratio is preferably in the range of 7/3 to 3/7 in the former stage and in the range of 10/0 to 5/5 in the latter stage. 2 to 3 stages are typically adopted for the activity change or dilution of a catalyst.",
        "Dilution ratios of the catalysts packed inside the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c do not need to be the same with each other. For example, the reaction tube 1a has a high maximum temperature so that there is a high possibility of catalyst deterioration. To prevent the deterioration, it is possible to lower the catalyst particle ratio in the former stage and to increase the catalyst particle ratio in the latter stage.",
        "Differences in reaction conversions among the respective reaction tubes may affect the average conversion and yield of the entire reactor. Therefore, it is preferable that the dilution rate is set so that the same conversion is obtained in the respective reaction tubes even when dilution ratios are changed.",
        "The present invention is suitably applied to a multitube reactor for oxidizing propylene or isobutylene with a molecular oxygen-containing gas or to a multitube reactor in which (meth)acrolein is oxidized with a molecular oxygen-containing gas to yield (meth)acrylic acid. A catalyst used in oxidation of propylene is preferably a multicomponent mixed metal oxide, mainly an Mo\u2014Bi mixed metal oxide. A catalyst used in oxidation of acrolein to yield acrylic acid is preferably an Sb\u2014Mo mixed oxide.",
        "Propylene or isobutylene is typically oxidized in 2 stages and hence different catalysts may be packed inside 2 multitube reactors to carry out a reaction. Alternatively, the present invention can also be applied to the case of yielding (meth)acrylic acid in a single reactor with the shell of the reactor divided into 2 or more chambers by intermediate tube plates as shown in FIG. 5 and with the chambers packed with different catalysts.",
        "In a multitube reactor for oxidizing propylene or isobutylene with a molecular oxygen-containing gas, when the reactor shown in FIG. 1 is adopted and the raw material gas Rg enters from 4a and is discharged from 4b, the concentration of the target product (meth) acrolein is high in the vicinity of the shell outlet 5b. In addition, the temperature of the raw material gas increases because the raw material gas is heated by the heat of reaction. Therefore, in this case, a heat exchanger is additionally provided in the course of the raw material gas Rg following 4b of the shell shown in FIG. 1, to thereby sufficiently cool the reaction gas to prevent (meth)acrolein from causing an autooxidation reaction.",
        "In the case where the reactor shown in FIG. 5 is adopted, when the raw material gas Rg enters from 4a and is discharged from 4b, the concentration of the target product (meth)acrolein is high in the vicinity of the catalyst layer outlet 9 in the former stage. In addition, the temperature of the raw material gas increases because the gas is heated by the heat of reaction.",
        "When a catalyst is packed only into 5a-6a-6b-6a-9, no reaction is carried out in the catalyst layer outlet portion (between 9 and 5b) in the latter stage of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c. The raw material gas is cooled by the heat media Hm1 and Hm2 flowing through flow paths to the shell in order to prevent (meth)acrolein from causing an autooxidation reaction. In this case, the gas outlet portion (between 9 and 5b) of each of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c is packed with no catalyst or with an inert substance without reaction activity. However, the latter is preferably packed for improving heat transfer characteristics.",
        "In addition, in FIG. 5, in the case where the catalyst layer (5a-6a-6b-6a-9) in the former stage on the inlet side of the raw material gas Rg and the catalyst layer (9-6a\u2032-6b\u2032-6a\u2032-5b) in the latter stage on the outlet side of the gas are packed with different catalysts to obtain (meth)acrolein and (meth)acrylic acid from propylene and isobutylene, the temperature of the catalyst layer in the former stage is higher than that of the catalyst layer in the latter stage. Therefore, no reaction is carried out around the catalyst layer outlet (6a-9) in the former stage and the catalyst layer inlet (9-6a\u2032) in the latter stage because a position around them has a high temperature. The raw material gas is cooled by the heat medium flowing through a flow path to the shell side in order to prevent (meth)acrolein from causing an autooxidation reaction.",
        "In this case, a portion into which no catalyst is packed is provided among 6a-9-6a\u2032 of the reaction tubes 1a, 1b, and 1c to serve as a cavity.

The temperature inside the ring-shaped tubes (3a, preferably also 3b) can be monitored by providing the plurality of thermometers 15.",
        "The number of the baffles provided inside the shell is not particularly limited, but three baffles (2 baffles of 6a type and 1 baffle of 6b type) are preferably provided as usual. The baffles prevent an upflow of the heat medium, changes the flow of the heat medium to a lateral direction with respect to an axial direction of the reaction tubes. The heat medium converges from an outer peripheral portion to a central portion of the shell, changes direction in the opening portion of the baffle 6a, flows to the outer peripheral portion of the shell, and reaches the outer cylinder of the shell. The heat medium changes direction again on an outer periphery of the baffle 6b, converges to the central portion, flows upward through the opening portion of the baffle 6a, flows along the upper tube plate 5a toward the outer periphery of the shell, and flows through the ring-shaped tube 3b to circulate to the pump.",
        "Thermometers 11 are inserted to the reaction tubes arranged inside the reactor and signals are transmitted to the outside of the reactor, to thereby record temperature distributions of the catalyst layers in an axial direction of the reactor.

        "The reaction tubes are classified into two types depending on their placements in relation to opening portions of the three baffles, that is, on flow directions of the heat medium.",
        "The reaction tube 1b is restrained by the three baffles 6a, 6b, and 6c, and most of the reaction tubes are arranged in this region. The flow direction of the heat medium in the entire region of the reaction tube 1b is substantially at a right angle with an axial direction of the reaction tubes. The reaction tube 1c is in the vicinity of the outer periphery of the shell, is not restrained by the baffle 6b, and is provided in the outer peripheral portion of the baffle 6b. The central portion of the reaction tube 1c is in a region where a flow direction of the heat medium changes, in this region, that is, in the central portion of the reaction tube 1c, the heat medium flows in parallel with an axial direction of the reaction tubes.",
        "FIG. 4 shows a view of the reactor of FIG. 1 seen from above. Not only the flow of the heat medium becomes parallel with the axial direction of the reaction tubes but also the flow rate of the heat medium becomes extremely small to provide extremely poor heat transfer efficiency in the region where the heat medium converges at the opening portion of the baffle 6a, that is, at the center of the shell.

The heat medium changes direction at the respective opening portions, preventing a by-pass flow of the heat medium and enabling a change in flow rate. Segment-type noncircular baffles shown in FIG. 2 or disc-type baffles shown in FIG. 3 can be applied as long as the baffles are arranged as described. The relationship between the flow direction of the heat medium and the axial direction of the reaction tubes does not change with both types of baffles.",

An opening area in the central portion of the baffle 6a is preferably 5 to 50%, more preferably 10 to 30% of a sectional area of the shell. The opening area between the baffle 6b and the shell body plate 2 is preferably 5 to 50%, more preferably 10 to 30% of a sectional area of the shell. A too small opening ratio of the baffles (6a and 6b) provides a long flow path of the heat medium, increasing a pressure loss between the ring-shaped tubes (3a and 3b) and requiring high power for the heat medium circulating pump 7. A too large opening ratio of the baffles increases the number of the reaction tubes (1c) Most of the baffles are arranged at equal spacings (spacing between baffles 6a and 6b, and spacing between baffle 6a and each of tube plates 5a and 5b), but the baffles need not to be arranged at equal spacings. It is preferable that a required flow rate of the heat medium determined by heat of oxidation reaction generated inside the reaction tubes is ensured and a pressure loss of the heat medium remains low. Hot spot positions in a temperature distribution in the reaction tubes and the baffle positions must not be the same from the ring-shaped tube 3a at the inlet of the heat medium. This is because the flow rate of the heat medium decreases in the vicinity of baffle surface, providing a small heat transfer coefficient. Thus, hot spot temperature further increases when the baffle positions overlap the hot spot positions.",

Note that, in the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method, concentration of propylene, propane, or isobutylene in the raw material gas is preferably 6 to 10 mol %.",
        "The arrangement of the catalyst in layers inside the reaction tubes, which increases the activity from the raw material gas inlet to the cutlet, can suppress hot spot formation and heat storage of the hot spot portions. Thus, the reaction can be carried out safely and efficiently, to thereby attain improvements on productivity without reducing the catalyst life.",
        "Various methods for changing the catalytic activity inside the reaction tubes can be applied to catalyst packing to the reaction tubes of the multitube reactor according to the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method. Examples thereof include: a method of using catalysts having different catalytic activities by adjusting catalyst compositions; and a method of adjusting the activities by mixing catalyst particles with inert substance particles and diluting the catalyst. To be specific, a catalyst having a high ratio of the inert substance particles and a catalyst having a low ratio of the inert substance particles are packed in the raw material gas inlet portion of the reaction tubes and the outlet portion of the reaction tubes, respectively. The ratio of the inert substance particles used differs depending on the catalyst. The ratio of the inert substance particles used in a first stage is often 0.3 to 0.7. The ratio of the inert substance particles used in a second stage is suitably 0.5 to 1.0. Two to five stages are adopted in the change of activity and the dilution of the catalyst generally.",
        "A dilution degree of the catalyst packed in the reaction tubes need not be the same for all the reaction tubes. For example, a portion in the vicinity of the reaction tube center within the reaction tube 1b has high hot spot temperature, and thus has a high possibility of catalyst deterioration. To prevent catalyst deterioration, the reaction tube in such a portion can have a smaller ratio of the inert substance in the first stage compared to those of the reaction tubes in other portions, and on the other hand, can have a larger ratio of the catalyst in the second stage compared to those of the reaction tubes in other portions. Different reaction conversions of the respective reaction tubes affect the average conversion or yield of the entire reactor. Thus, even when the dilution degree is changed, it is preferable to set the respective reaction tubes to obtain the same conversions.",
        "The type and shape of the inert substance used in the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction method are the same as those for the above-mentioned multitube reactor of the present invention.",
        "The raw material gas flowing through the reaction tubes is heated while first flowing through catalyst layers packed in the raw material gas inlet portions of the reaction tubes and having a low catalytic activity, and reaches a reaction starting temperature. The raw material (propylene or isobutylene) is oxidized through an oxidation reaction by a catalyst included in succeeding layers in the reaction tubes, and is heated to higher temperature by the heat of oxidation reaction. The reaction weight is most in the catalyst layers in the vicinity of the raw material gas inlet. The heat of reaction generated increases the temperature of the raw material gas when the heat of reaction is greater than the heat removal by the heat medium generally, thereby forming the hot spots. The hot spots, though depending on catalytic activity adjustment, often form at positions from the raw material gas inlet of the reaction tubes to 10 to 80% of the entire length of the reaction tubes. For example, the hot spot form at positions 0.3 to 3.2 m from the raw material gas inlet of the reaction tubes that are 3 to 4 m long.",
        "The effect of the generated heat of reaction on the catalyst, the heat medium temperature in acrolein production through an oxidation reaction of propylene with a molecular oxygen-containing gas, the allowable maximum temperature of the hot spots, the type of the heat medium used in the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction, and the effect of a fluid state of the heat medium on heat removal efficiency are the same as those of the above-mentioned multitube reactor of the present invention.",
        "Inner diameters of the reaction tubes significantly affecting a gas linear velocity are very important because: inside of the reaction tubes containing an oxidation catalyst inside the oxidation reactor is in a vapor phase; the gas linear velocity is limited by resistance of the catalyst; and the heat transfer coefficient inside the reaction tubes are very small, the heat transfer becoming rate determining.",
        "The inner diameters of the reaction tubes of the multitube reactor according to the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction method depend on the amount of the heat of reaction and a particle size of the catalyst inside the reaction tubes, but the inner diameter is preferably 10 to 50 mm, more preferably 20 to 30 mm. Too small inner diameters-of the reaction tubes decrease the amount of the catalyst packed and increase the number of reaction tubes with respect to the necessary amount of the catalyst, thereby requiring a large reactor. On the other hand, too large inner diameters of the reaction tubes provide a small reaction tube surface area with respect to the necessary amount of the catalyst, thereby reducing a heat transfer area for removal of the heat of reaction.",
        "The second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method is suitably applied to: a vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction for obtaining (meth)acrolein by oxidizing propylene, propane, or isobutylene with a molecular oxygen-containing gas; and a vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction for obtaining (meth)acrylic acid by oxidizing (meth)acrolein with a molecular oxygen-containing gas. A Mo\u2014Bi multi-component mixed metal oxide is used as the catalyst for the oxidation of propylene, propane, and isobutylene, and a Sb\u2014Mo multi-component mixed metal oxide is used as the catalyst for the oxidation of acrolein to produce acrylic acid.",
        "Note that, the Mo\u2014Bi catalyst preferably used in the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method is the same as that represented by the general formula (I) in the above-mentioned multitube reactor of the present invention. Note that, the Mo\u2014Bi catalyst used in the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method is preferably produced through methods disclosed in JP 06-013096 B and the like, for example. Further, the Sb\u2014Mo catalyst is preferably produced through methods disclosed in JP 06-38918 B and the like, for example.",
        "The Mo\u2014Bi catalyst is produced following general production methods except that a mixed carbonate salt of a C component and Bi is prepared in advance as a Bi source compound, for example. The preparation of the mixed carbonate salt of a C component and B in advance involves, for example: mixing predetermined amounts of respective aqueous nitrate solutions of Bi and the C component; adding the nitrate solutions dropwise to an aqueous solution of ammonium carbonate or ammonium bicarbonate while mixing the whole; and washing the obtained precipitate and drying the precipitate if necessary.",
        "The production of the Mo\u2014Bi catalyst generally includes an integration step of performing integration of source compounds of the respective elements in an aqueous system and a heating step. Here, the term \u201cintegration of source compounds of the respective elements in an aqueous system\u201d means temporarily or gradually integrating aqueous solutions or aqueous dispersions of the respective compounds. Here, the term \u201csource compounds of the respective elements\u201d does not mean compounds of the respective elements alone, but includes compounds collectively containing multiple elements (such as ammonium phosphomolybdate for Mo and P). Further, the term \u201cintegration\u201d does not mean integration of the source compounds of the respective elements alone, but also includes integration with support materials such as alumina, silica-alumina, and refractory oxides, which may be used if necessary.",
        "On the other hand, \u201cheating\u201d is carried out for the purposes including: formation of separate oxides and/or mixed oxides of the source compounds of the respective elements; and/or formation of oxides and/or mixed compounds of the mixed oxides obtained through integration; and/or heat treatment of the final mixed oxide products. Further, the heating need not be applied to primarily integration products of the source compounds of the respective elements, and the heating is not necessarily limited to once.",
        "Thus, in the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method, the term \u201cheating\u201d includes heating the source compounds of the respective elements separately and gradually forming the oxides (and may include forming mixed oxides). Further, the term \u201cincluding an integration step and a heating step\u201d means that steps of drying, pulverization, molding, and the like may be included in addition to the two steps.",

The compound is preferably used in a powder form. The compounds as raw materials for catalyst production may consist of particles larger than the powder but preferably consist of small particles, considering the heating step for thermal diffusion. Thus, if the compounds as raw materials do not consist of small particles, the compounds are preferably pulverized before the heating step.",
        "A specific example of the catalyst production method according to the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method is as follows. Aqueous solutions of compounds of iron, cobalt, and nickel, preferably nitrates of the respective elements are added to a suitable aqueous solution of a molybdenum compound, preferably ammonium molybdate. Further, aqueous solutions of compounds of sodium, potassium, rubidium, thallium, boron, phosphorus, arsenic, and/or tungsten, preferably water-soluble salts of the respective elements are added to the mixture. Further, particulate or colloidal silica is added to the mixture if necessary. Next, bismuth subcarbonate powder containing a C component prepared in advance is added to the mixture. Bismuth subcarbonate containing a C component in advance is prepared as described above by: mixing bismuth and aqueous solutions such as Mg, Ca, Zn, Ce, and/or Sm, preferably aqueous solutions of nitrates of the respective elements; adding the aqueous solutions dropwise to an aqueous solution of ammonium carbonate or ammonium bicarbonate while mixing the whole; and washing the obtained slurry with water and the drying the slurry.",
        "Next, the obtained slurry is sufficiently agitated, and then dried. The dried granule or cake product is subjected to heat treatment in air at 250 to 350\u00b0 C. for a short period of time. Here, the obtained heat-treated product already contains salts of iron, cobalt, and nickel with acidic oxides, but contains bismuth subcarbonate mostly remained in a form of the raw material. This fact indicates that bismuth subcarbonate may be added at any time.",

Different heat mediums circulate in the respective divided spaces, and the spaces are controlled to different temperatures. A raw material gas may be introduced from either the port 4a or 4b. In FIG. 5, a flow direction of the heat medium inside the shell is indicated by arrows as an upflow, and thus, reference numeral 4a represents the raw material feed port in which the raw material gas process gas flows in a countercurrent to the heat medium.

First, the mixed gas is converted to (meth)acrolein in a first stage (reaction tubes in area A) for a former stage reaction, and the (meth)acrolein is then oxidized in a second stage (reaction tubes in area B) for a latter stage reaction, to thereby produce (meth)acrylic acid. A first stage portion of the reaction tubes (hereinafter, may also be referred to as \u201cformer stage portion\u201d) and a second stage portion of the reaction tubes (hereinafter, may also be referred to as \u201clatter stage portion\u201d) are packed with different catalysts and are controlled to different temperatures for a reaction under optimum conditions.

However, precision of reaction temperature at lower temperatures tends to degrade when the temperature difference exceeds 100\u00b0 C. because heat transfer from a high-temperature heat medium to a low-temperature heat medium cannot be neglected. In such a case, heat insulation is required above or below the intermediate tube plate for preventing the heat transfer. FIG. 6 shows a case employing a heat insulation board, and two to three thermal shields 10 are provided at positions of about 10 cm below or above the intermediate tube plate to form a flowless stagnant space 12 filled with the heat medium. It is preferable to produce a heat insulation effect thereby. Thermal shields 10 are fixed to the intermediate tube plate 9 by, for example, spacer rods 13.",
        "The flow direction of the heat medium inside the shell is indicated by arrows as an upflow in FIGS. 1 and 5, but the second vapor phase catalytic oxidation method can also be applied to reactors having opposite directions of the heat medium. A direction of circulation flow of the heat medium must be set to prevent a phenomenon of engulfing, in the heat medium, a gas, specifically, an inert gas such as nitrogen existing on upper ends of the shell 2 and the circulating pump 7. The gas may be engulfed in an upflow heat medium in an upper portion inside the circulating pump 7 and a cavitation phenomenon may be caused inside the circulating pump, possibly resulting in a worst case of pump breakdown. The gas may also be engulfed in a downflow heat medium in an upper portion of the shell and a stagnant portion of a gas phase may form in an upper portion of the shell, thereby preventing cooling of the upper portion of the reaction tubes provided in the stagnant portion by the heat medium.",

The heat medium draw line is preferably provided at least above a tube plate 5a.",

Thus, a heat exchanger is preferably provided after the product discharging port 4b of the reactor shown in FIG. 1, to thereby sufficiently cool the process gas and prevent an autooxidation reaction of (meth)acrolein.",

In this case, the reaction tubes 1b and 1c in area B (between 9 and 5b) are not packed with the catalyst, and the reaction tubes are left as cavities or packed with a solid without reaction activity.

In a shell-tube type reactor circulating a heat medium which is solid at normal temperature, and having reaction tubes and an introducing port and a discharging port of a fluid flowing outside the reaction tubes for removing heat generated in the reaction tubes, the start up method is characterized by comprising: introducing a gas at a temperature in the range of 100 to 400\u00b0 C. to the outside of the reaction tube to heat; and circulating the heat medium heated outside the reaction tube.",
        "Hereinafter, the start up method of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. FIG. 13 is a process explanatory diagram showing an example of a preferable mode according to the start up method of the present invention.",
        "The start up method of the present invention is a start up method for a shell-tube type reactor circulating a heat medium which is solid at normal temperature and having reaction tubes and an introducing port and a discharging port of a fluid flowing outside the reaction tubes for removing heat generated in the reaction tubes.",
        "First, the shell-tube type reactor used in the start up method of the present invention is described. Any one of the conventionally known reactors may be employed as the shell-tube type reactor as long as the reactor employed has reaction tubes and an introducing port and a discharging port of a fluid flowing outside the reaction tubes for removing heat generated in the reaction tubes. Above all, a multitube reactor is preferable because the reactor provides a high reaction efficiency per a volume of the reactor.",
        "A multitube reactor that can be used in the start up method of the present invention generally has the following structure. That is, tube plates are arranged on the top and bottom in the shell and a plurality of reaction tubes are equipped inside the shell with both ends of each reaction tube supported and fixed by the tube plates. Furthermore, an introducing port and a discharging port of a fluid flowing outside the reaction tubes of the shell are provided for removing heat generated in the reaction tubes. In the start up method of the present invention, shields may also be equipped for dividing the inside of the shell into multiple chambers.",
        "Next, a description is given of a heat medium used as a fluid flowing outside the reaction tubes in the start up method of the present invention. The solidifying point of the heat medium is typically in the range of 50 to 250\u00b0 C., preferably in the range of 130 to 180\u00b0 C. Representative examples of such a heat medium include niter. Niter is particularly preferable because niter is excellent in thermal stability among the heat media used for controlling temperature in a chemical reaction and, in particular, has the most excellent stability to heat exchange at high temperatures ranging from 350 to 550\u00b0 C.",
        "Niter is the so-called molten salt and may adopt various compositions. Therefore, the solidifying point of niter varies depending on the compositions. However, niter of any composition can be suitably used in the start up method of the present invention as long as the niter has a solidifying point in the above range. Examples of a compound used as such niter include sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, and potassium nitrate. Each of those compounds can be used alone or 2 or more types of them can be mixed before use.",
        "Next, the characteristics of the start up method of the present invention will be described. In the start up method of the present invention, a gas at a temperature in the range of 100 to 400\u00b0 C. is introduced to the outside of the reaction tubes to previously heat the inside of the reactor to a temperature equal to or higher than the solidifying point of the heat medium. That is, in the method described in the above-mentioned unexamined publication, a gas for heating a reactor is introduced into reaction tubes packed with a catalyst whereas, in the start up method of the present invention, the gas is introduced to the outside of the reaction tubes. This is a characteristic of the start up method of the present invention. A start up method for a reactor according to the start up method of the present invention does not adversely affect the catalyst. Preferable examples of the gas for heating a reactor include air.",
        "Next, the above-mentioned heating method in the process shown in FIG. 13 will be described. In FIG. 13, a reactor represented by reference numeral (50) has a first chamber and a second chamber. In the example shown in the figure, a process gas is fed as a downflow while a heat medium is fed in an upflow. Lines (L1, L2, L3, and L4) constitute a process line, and lines (L6, L7, L8, L9, L10, L12, L13, and L14) constitute a heat medium line. Lines (L15 and L16) constitute a discharge line used during heating. In the figure, symbols \u25ef\u25cf- and \u25cf\u25ef- each represent a spectacle blind (SB), so-called partition. An SB is inserted into tubing to open and close a flow path. The former symbol represents an opened state, and the latter symbol represents a closed state.",
        "First, an SB (61) is inserted into the line (L3) (that is, the flow path is closed) to close the feed line, used in ordinary operation, to the reaction tube (catalyst layer) of the reactor (50). Then, an SB (62) and an SB (63) are detached from the line (L5) (that is, the flow path is opened) to establish a line by the shell of the reactor (50) consisting of line (L1)\u2192blower (10)\u2192line (L2)\u2192line (L5)\u2192line (L6)\u2192heater (21)\u2192line (L7) and line (L8)\u2192tank (30)\u2192line (L9). At this time, a valve (71) of the line (L5) is closed. Furthermore, an SB (64) of the line (L15) and a valve (72) of the line (L6) are opened to discharge the introduced gas.",
        "Subsequently, the blower (10) is started, and the gas heated to a temperature in the range of 100 to 400\u00b0 C. is introduced to the outside of the reaction tube of the reactor (50) by using the heater (21). The gas heats the reactor (50). The temperature inside the reactor (50) is preferably equal to or higher than the solidifying point of the heat medium subsequently circulated, and the temperature can be appropriately selected depending on the heat medium used. In general, it is sufficient to heat the shell of the reactor (50) to a temperature in the range of 150 to 250\u00b0 C. This is because a temperature of the shell within the above range prevents resolidification of the heat medium even if the heat medium is fed after heating the shell since the heat medium has a solidifying point in the range of 50 to 250\u00b0 C. At this time, it is preferable to keep the reaction tube (catalyst side) in an air atmosphere.",
        "Subsequently, the blower (10) is stopped. The SB (62) of the line (L5) and the SB (63) of the line (L15) are closed. The valve (72) of the line (L16) is opened. Pumps (41 and 42) are started to introduce a heat medium into each of the first chamber (51) and second chamber (52) of the reactor (50) Then, the heat medium is circulated in each chamber by using an attached pump (43) to increase the temperature inside each chamber.",
        "Each operation described above is preferably performed quickly, preferably within 1 hour. Too slow operation may cause resolidification of a heat medium when introducing the heat medium because the temperature of the shell decreases due to radiation of heat.",
        "When heat exchange is performed by using a heat medium which is solid at normal temperature, the total amount of the heat medium is often recovered in the tank (30) after the use of the reactor (50). In such a case, the heat medium does not remain in the reactor (50) and is stored in the tank (30). Therefore, the heat medium in the tank (30) is heated by heaters (22 and 23) to an extent that the fluidity of the heat medium is ensured, and the heat medium is then introduced into the reactor (50).",
        "The heat medium is introduced into the reactor (50) through 2 routes as described below. That is, the heat medium is fed to the first chamber (51) by the heat medium pump (41) of the tank (30) via the lines (L13, L14, L6, and L7). In addition, the heat medium is fed to the second chamber (52) by the heat medium pump (42) of the tank (30) through the lines (L12 and L10).",
        "Then, the heat medium introduced into the reactor (50) is circulated inside each chamber by the attached pump (43). This is because the temperature inside the reactor (50) may not be increased to a target temperature only by introducing and circulating the heat medium heated in advance. In view of this, the heat medium is circulated, heated by the heater (21), and then introduced into the reactor (50) again. For example, the heat medium is discharged from the first chamber (51) and the line (L8) and is introduced into the reactor (50) by the pump (41) through the line (L7) via the heater (21).",
        "In the case where the required temperature of the reactor (50) can be ensured through circulation of the heat-medium as described above, the production of a target product can be started by feeding a raw material gas to reaction tubes (catalyst side).",
        "A start up method for a reactor according to the start up method of the present invention is particularly preferable as a start up method for a reactor used in the production of, for example, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrolein, or methacrolein. This is because of the following reason. That is, acrylic acid or the like is a compound produced and used in a large amount, and a reactor becomes large in response to this. Therefore, it is particularly difficult to heat the reactor. The start up method of the present invention is particularly suitable for heating during start up of a large-scale reactor.",
        "Acrylic acid is produced by: feeding propylene, propane, acrolein, or the like as a raw material gas to a conventionally known reactor packed with an oxidation catalyst; and allowing to react through a vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction. In general, a raw material gas is allowed to coexist with given amounts of a molecular oxygen-containing gas and an inert gas and then a vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction is carried out. For instance, when propylene is used as a raw material gas, acrolein is produced first. Then, acrolein is oxidized through vapor phase catalytic oxidation to yield acrylic acid.",
        "Conventionally known oxidation catalysts can be used as former stage and latter stage catalysts in the 2-stage vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction described above. Furthermore, a shape of the catalyst is not particularly limited and may be spherical, columnar, cylindrical, and the like. Furthermore, the catalyst may be diluted with a solid inert material when the catalyst is packed.
