        "Aspects of the disclosure relate to imaging methods, image engines, and photoconductor charging systems.",
        "A multi-step electrophotographic (EP) process is the basis for numerous laser printers, copiers, multiple function devices, and other configurations. In a first step, a photoconductor is electrically charged for the subsequent formation of latent images. The photoconductor may be charged using one or more charge roller, corona or scorotron in some implementations. In but one example, the Indigo 3000 press available from The Hewlett-Packard Company has three sets of double scorotrons for charging the photoconductor.",
        "A charge roller may include a metal shaft with a conductive elastomer surrounding it. The outer portion has been constructed in two ways in some arrangements. A first example includes a single layer with a moderately conductive material, usually an ionic conductive agent, mixed inside. A single-layer charge roller may also have a thin (e.g., thickness of a few microns) insulating layer outwardly of the conductive material or layer.",
        "Another example of a charge roller has plural layers including an insulating outer sleeve of increased thickness (e.g., greater than a few microns) and an inner elastomeric region which may be loaded with a highly conductive network such as carbon. A double-layer charge roller generally charges less uniformly compared with a single layer charge roller due to the difficulty in providing a constant sleeve thickness. Accordingly, a single-layer charge roller system may provide images of increased quality and may be preferred for high-quality color image applications.",
        "A core of a charge roller may be supplied with direct current (DC) electrical energy and possibly an additional alternating current (AC) voltage during use. If DC energy is used alone, the shaft voltage may be roughly 600 V higher than a desired voltage to be provided at a surface of the photoconductor. The extra 600 V is provided to generate ions in the air as dictated by the Paschen curve. With usage of AC energy, the voltage of the DC energy may be close to a desired photoconductor voltage with an AC amplitude of 600 V peak or more. The addition of AC usually creates a more uniform charge layer on the photoconductor adding or subtracting the photoconductor surface charge as needed.",
        "The conduction mechanism of a single-layer charge roller is mobile ion movement in response to an applied electric field. If material (e.g., elastomer) is sandwiched between the two electrodes (e.g., charge roller shaft and photoconductor) and a voltage is applied, a current flows, generally falling with time. This is consistent with ions moving and accumulating at one side and leaving behind a charged layer of the opposite polarity on the other side which decreases the electric field available for moving current within the layer. Some charge injection may also occur at the electrodes which could neutralize some of the ions, thus decreasing the ion concentration over time.",
        "For printers of relatively reduced speed, the charge roller may be engineered to last the life of a replaceable cartridge. For relatively high-speed machines, the charge roller may be expected to have extended use before needing replacement.",
        "Over time, a charge voltage of a photoconductor may fall or drop. For example, referring to FIG. 1, measurements indicate that photoconductor charge voltage may drop over time with partial recovery during stoppage of imaging operations. In some situations, recovery may not occur even after imaging operations have ceased (e.g., no recovery is evident after a hour break at approximately 80,000 photoconductor page cycles (impressions) of FIG. 2).",
        "The non-recovery of FIG. 2 may probably be attributed to two factors. First, a charge roller surface having a charge may attract charges of the opposite sign during operation. This can be partially remedied by turning off the charge roller since the charges may turn back towards the conductive shaft. In addition, some ions may leach from the surface due to relatively high concentrations and proximity to the surface and are lost due to recombination, decreasing the roller ion concentration. The long-term reduction in the photoconductor charge voltage is likely due to the latter. Accordingly, DC bias may be increased to provide a substantially constant photoconductor charge voltage.",
        "The above-described situation may worsen if high-speed printing is implemented in non-stop applications because the charge roller may not be allowed to sufficiently recover. In this case, additional problems may be present. For example, the charge roller may physically degrade due to high ionic concentration at an interface for most desired charge roller formulations. The high concentration may alter a local environment within the charge roller causing polymeric bonds of the charge roller to break. The result is that the elastomeric portions of the charge roller may return to a liquid state in the local region. The environment may be catalytic because the deterioration has been observed to continue long after the voltage is removed and the charge roller may continue to disintegrate. Affected regions of the charge roller may have a surface defect or a sticky surface stain which may negatively impact electrophotographic processes.",
        "Rollers of similar composition used to donate charge or bias a surface may suffer the same drawbacks (e.g., if run at high speed in non-stop applications). An example is a transfer roller used in some electrophotographic applications which helps move toner from the photoconductor to the printing media wherein a voltage is applied between the transfer roller and the photoconductor to attract toner from the imaged photoconductor.",

According to one aspect of charge system 22, net DC current flow within layer 72 (e.g., into or out of core 70) is reduced, minimized or eliminated to reduce degradation of charge device 42.",
        "Still referring to FIG. 6, DC power supply 60 is coupled with bias member 64 and DC power supply 62 is coupled with core 70 of charge device 42. As discussed further below, power supply 60 may apply a desired electrical bias to bias member 64 to reduce net DC current or charge flowing within layer 72. Power supply 62 may apply a desired electrical bias to core 70 to provide an appropriate charge to the outer surface of imaging member 20 as is also discussed further below.",
        "In one embodiment, charge system 22 is arranged to provide a charge of approximately \u22121000 V upon the outer surface of imaging member 20 rotated adjacent to charge device 42. Second power supply 62 is configured to provide electrical energy having a sufficient voltage magnitude to overcome losses while providing the desired voltage upon the outer surface of imaging member 20. For example, power supply 62 may provide a voltage of approximately \u22121600 V to core 70 to provide the desired voltage to the outer surface (e.g., \u22121000 V).",
        "As mentioned above, power supply 60 may charge bias member 64 to a proper voltage to reduce the net DC current or charge flowing in outer layer 72 during charging of imaging member 20. In the above-described example wherein the surface of imaging member 20 is charged to approximately \u22121000 V, power supply 60 may provide a bias voltage of approximately \u22121800 V to bias member 64. Accordingly, power supplies 60, 62 provide voltages of the same polarity to charge device 42 and bias member 64 in at least one embodiment.",
        "It is believed that DC current passing through outer layer 72 (either into core 70 or from core 70) may be related to disintegration of charge device 42 and/or voltage drops of charge received by the outer surface of imaging member 20 during charging of imaging member 20. More specifically, the continuous passage of DC current in a single direction (e.g., either radially into or out of core 70) may lead to the negative operational aspects described above. Bias member 64 applies current to charge device 42 to provide current passing in different directions (e.g., different radial directions) through outer layer 72 during imaging operations to reduce DC current flow in a single direction through layer 72 (e.g., into or out of core 70) during imaging.",
        "Consider a surface patch on the outer surface of charge device 42 and a region of outer layer 72 inward of the surface patch. When the patch contacts imaging member 20, charge carriers (e.g., depending upon the biasing polarities involved exemplary charge carriers include electrons, negatively charged ions, positively charged ions, etc.) from the patch and the underlying region are donated or transported in a substantially radial direction of charge device 42 to the discharged surface of imaging member 20 to charge the surface from \u221250 V to approximately \u22121000 V. After the charge device 42 rotates 180 degrees in the illustrative example, the patch contacts bias member 64 which donates charge carriers which are transported in a substantially radial direction of charge device 42 to the patch and underlying region for restoration to a rest state. The charging of charge device 42 may be imparted from an area and a direction external of the outer surface of the charge device 42 in at least one embodiment. As shown, different portions of charge device 42 may be simultaneously donating and receiving charge carriers during imaging operations.",
        "Accordingly, in one embodiment, during charging of imaging member 20, charge carriers of one sign flow in one direction with respect to the outer surface of charge device 42 while charge carriers of the same sign flow in an opposite direction with respect to the outer surface of charge device 42 during charging of charge device 42 by bias member 64. It follows that the DC current flow relative to the outer surface of charge device 42 is substantially b-directional or AC in nature and the net DC current flow through material of outer layer 72 is substantially zero in the exemplary embodiments of FIGS. 6-8 during imaging operations leading to extended life of charge device 42.",
        "According to the described example wherein the imaging member 20 is negatively charged, negative charge carriers flow from the charge device 42 to the imaging member 20 when the imaging member 20 is being charged and negative charge carriers flow from the bias member 64 to the charge device 42 when the charge device 42 is being charged. With respect to the outer surface of charge device 42, the directions of the above-described charge carrier flow are opposite for the charging of the imaging member 20 and the charge device 42.",
        "Referring to the embodiments of FIGS. 7-8, exemplary charging systems 22a, 22b may utilize AC voltages to implement charging of imaging member 20. The utilization of AC voltages may result in more efficient charging by the respective systems 22a, 22b compared with the DC charging system 22. The AC voltages may more efficiently initiate Paschen breakdown in the air gaps adjacent to contact nip 45 between imaging member 20 and charge device 42.",
        "Referring to FIG. 7, an exemplary charging system 22a which utilizes AC voltages is shown. The depicted charging system 22a includes a DC power supply 80, an AC power supply 82, a step-up transformer 84 and a coupling capacitor 86 in addition to the previously described illustrated components of charging system 22.",
        "In embodiments wherein the imaging member 20 is charged to \u22121000 V, DC power supply 80 may provide a DC voltage of about \u22121300 V and AC power supply 82 may provide electrical energy of 1400 V peak-to-peak and having a frequency of 6 kHz in one implementation. Transformer 84 adds the AC voltage to the output of the DC power supply 80 to produce the drive voltage for bias member 64. Coupling capacitor 86 passes the AC voltage to core 70 of charge device 42. Application of the AC voltage to charge device 42 and bias member 64 induces Paschen breakdown in the air gaps adjacent to contact nip 45 of imaging member 20 and charge device 42 providing imaging member 20 with a more uniform voltage compared with the embodiment of FIG. 6. In addition, loading upon AC power supply 82 may be reduced if the charge device 42 and bias member 64 are maintained at substantially the same AC voltage.",
        "A value of coupling capacitor 86 may be chosen so the AC reactance of the coupling capacitor 86 is relatively small compared to the AC reactance of the charge device 42. In one embodiment, a value of coupling capacitor 86 may be 0.01 uF or larger for an embodiment wherein a capacitance of the core 70 to imaging member 20 is approximately 600 pF.",
        "Referring to FIG. 8, another possible embodiment of charging system 22b utilizing AC voltages is shown. With respect to the embodiment of FIG. 7, the depicted charging system 22b omits capacitor 86, and includes a transformer 84a having plural secondary windings, plural DC power supplies 90, 92 and an AC power supply 94.",
        "As shown, first and second DC power supplies 90, 92 are coupled with first and second secondary windings of transformer 84a, respectively. First DC power supply 90 may provide a DC voltage of approximately \u22121200 V and second DC power supply 92 may provide a DC voltage of approximately \u22121300 V to charge the outer surface of imaging member 20 to \u22121000 V according to the exemplary disclosed embodiment. AC power supply 94 may provide an AC voltage of 600 V peak-to-peak at a frequency of 6 kHz in one embodiment.",
        "As discussed above with respect to FIG. 6, the implementation of bias member 64 in the arrangement of FIGS. 7-8 provides DC current flow in the outer layer 72 in opposing directions. Accordingly, during imaging operations, the net DC current flow within outer layer 72 is reduced (e.g., substantially zero in the described embodiments) which has been observed to improve the longevity of charge device 42.",
        "The embodiments described herein are applicable to Indigo digital presses available from The Hewlett-Packard Company. The voltage values of the above-described embodiments may be tailored for application to other digital press configurations. For example, the described charge systems 22, 22a, 22b may be used to charge a positive-charging imaging member 20 wherein positive charge carriers would be conducted reversing all of the above-described DC voltages (i.e., the charge carriers include electrons or negative ions in the above-described embodiments having a negative-charging imaging member 20). If negative charges are also involved, they move in a direction opposite to that of positive charges. The values of the generated DC voltages may also be adjusted to achieve other desired charged voltages of the imaging member 20. In addition, the frequency of the AC voltage may be tailored to a minimum value to reduce or avoid visible banding plus a small safety margin reducing the current and power provided by the AC supply to a minimum value. In general, lower frequencies may be used for hard imaging devices 10 having slower process speeds. In the above-described embodiments, AC voltage having a frequency of 6 kHz may be used for process speeds of hard imaging devices 10 of 1.2 meters/second.",
        "Referring to FIG. 9, a configuration of a charge roller 100 with a modified bias roller 102 was tested in an Indigo 2000 Press available from The Hewlett-Packard Company. In order to test both configurations with and without the bias roller 102 simultaneously, a section 104 of the bias roller 102 was tapered down to a smaller diameter within which the bias roller 102 is not in contact with the charge roller 100. Remaining sections 106 of bias roller 102 are in contact with the charge roller 100. The length of the section 104 is a third of the length of the charge roller 100 in the illustration.",
        "AC voltage was not used during the tests illustrated using the arrangement of FIG. 9 while two DC power supplies were used, one for the bias roller 102 and one for the core of the charge roller 100 as described above with respect to FIG. 6 in one implementation. The voltage for the core of the charge roller 100 was adjusted to obtain the proper photoconductor charge voltage. The voltage for the bias roller 102 was adjusted so that the current drawn from the respective adjusted power supply of the bias roller 102 was twice as much as the current drawn from the power supply coupled with the charge roller 100. In this way, a middle section 108 of the charge roller 100 was solely driven by the charge roller power supply and outer sections solely by the bias roller 102. Assuming the outer sections of the charge roller 100 are driven solely by the bias roller 102, the net DC current flow within the outer sections of charge roller 100 was substantially zero throughout the charging experiment.",
        "After a semi-continuous run of 200 K impressions (60 K impressions per day) middle section 108 of charge roller 100 started showing surface damage while the outer sections showed no surface damage. Some of the rubber material of the middle section 108 liquefied and portions of the outer layer became detached in these areas. Simple application of finger pressure produced wrinkles on the charge roller surface coating in the middle section 108 and the liquefied charge roller material leaked out through breaks in a coating. The outer sections of charge device 100 showed no visible damage or change compared with the beginning of the experiment.",
        "Referring to FIG. 10, another example of an image engine 16a including another configuration of a charge system 22c is shown. The depicted exemplary image engine 16a omits illustration and discussion of other components discussed above which may be provided, such as charge systems 22, 22a or 22b to charge photoconductor drum 40, discharge device 24, development station 26 or other appropriate components to implement imaging operations.",
        "The depicted image engine 16a includes transfer member 28a including a transfer drum 48. Charge system 22c is implemented using transfer drum 48 and bias member 64 in the depicted embodiment. Transfer drum 48 defines a nip 53 with photoconductor drum 40 in the illustrated embodiment. Media 30 is configured to pass through nip 53 to receive developed images from photoconductor drum 40. Transfer drum 48 and bias member 64 of charge system 22c may be coupled with respective power supplies (not shown). For example, transfer drum 48 may be referred to as a charge device 42a electrically biased to assist with the attraction of the developed image from the photoconductor drum 40. More specifically; charge device 42a implemented as transfer drum 48 may charge the imaging member 20a comprising media 30 in the depicted example to assist with the transfer of developed images. Outer surface portions of charge device 42a which charge media 30 may be discharged during imaging. Bias member 64 may rotate with charge device 42a and be used to charge discharged portions of the outer surface of charge device 42a to reduce degradation of charge device 42a as described above. The embodiments herein illustrate exemplary aspects of the disclosure and other configurations of charge systems, charge devices and bias members are possible.",
