These highly functionalised compounds are useful as building blocks for a wide variety of bioactive compounds.",

Indeed, when carrying out a protection such as with Cl-TBDMS we found that the hydroxyl at position 2 reacted until being completely protected, and only then the OH at position 1 is protected.",
        "Without being bound by theory we believe that this is due to the existence of C\u2014H \u03c0 interactions between the H at position 2 and the W group. This means that the \u2014OH at position 2 is in an equatorial conformation, more reactive, while the \u2014OH at position 1 is in an axial conformation, less reactive. This allows the selective reaction of one position with respect to the other.",

        "In another embodiment the carbonyl group can also be selectively functionalized for example by Nucleophilic addition. Importantly, the lactam group does not react instead because it has a Weinreb type of amide. Thus cyanides, organolithium compounds, Grignard's reagents, ketones among other can be easily added to introduce the desired functionality at this position. If an hydride is used then an hydroxy at position 3 is generated. Suitable procedures for this kind of reactions are known in the art and can be found for example in Fischer, A. et al J. Org.

        "In another aspect of the invention, the second double bond (positions 4 and 5) can also be stereoselectively hydroxylated. This occurs more readily when the carbonyl group at position 3 is present, we think because it allows the in situ generation of an allylic alcohol, which might indicate that it plays a role in the oxidation process. Thus, under mild conditions:",

If a different stereochemistry is desired the appropriate oxidation or epimerization conditions can be selected. For example, under selective acidic or basic conditions the hydroxy at position 4 epimerizes. Alternatively hydroxyl inversions via the Mitsunobu type reaction, such as using DEAD, Ph3P and an acid such as benzoic or p-nitrobenzoic acid, can be used. Frequently, the inversion via Mitsunobu needs protection of the other hydroxyl groups.

Among the diol protecting groups that can be used we have O,O-acetals such as isopropylidene acetals (acetonides); cyclohexylidene and cyclopentylidene acetals; arylmethylene acetals; methylene acetals; diphenylmethylene acetals; 1,2-diacetals such as dispiroketal (dispoke) derivatives, cyclohexane-1,2-diacetals, butane-2,3-diacetals; silylene derivatives; 1,1,3,3-tetraisopropyldisiloxanylidene derivatives or N,O-acetals. Additional examples of diol protecting groups can be found in reference books such as Greene and Wuts' \u201cProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1999.",
        "As can be understood from the above and will be apparent to the person skilled in the art, due to the particular conformation and reactivity characteristics of the described compounds, a great number of possibilities can be achieved. It is important to point out that the obtained compounds of formula I will present a carefully crafted functionality at the different positions 1-5 and the desired stereochemistry. The introduction of different protecting groups opens the route to very selective further reactions by choosing the appropriate protection-deprotection strategies.",
        "The process to obtain any of these compounds can be readily designed by starting from a compound of formula IV above and then applying a basic set of reactions selected from:\n\n    a) Hydroxylation or dihydroxylation: as above explained, using mild (such as OsO4/N oxide amine) or strong systems (such as RuCl3) depending on the position to be hydroxylated. Alternative systems are also envisaged.\n    b) Nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl group: for example with a carbanion on a sp, sp2 or sp3 C, the carbanion can be prepared or generated in situ; or with an hydride.\n    c) Hydroxyl inversion: as previously explained, for example through epimerization or inversion, for example in Mitsunobu conditions.\n    d) Hydroxyl or carbonyl protection: as explained above, using the same or different protecting groups in conditions as explained above.",

Therefore the compounds of the present invention represented by the above described formula (I) may include pure enantiomers depending on the presence of stereogenic centers or diastereoisomers. The single isomers, enantiomers or diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof fall within the scope of the present invention.",

For example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of a hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a 13C\u2014or 14C-enriched carbon or 15N-enriched nitrogen are within the scope of this invention.",

Generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol or acetonitrile are preferred. Examples of the acid addition salts include mineral acid addition salts such as, for example, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, nitrate, phosphate, and organic acid addition salts such as, for example, acetate, maleate, fumarate, citrate, oxalate, succinate, tartrate, malate, mandelate, methanesulphonate and p-toluenesulphonate.",
