        "The present invention relates to a soft handle having a lighting apparatus, which includes a soft shell connecting with an inner shaft. A lighting apparatus is connected in one side of the shaft in order to provide lighting purpose for increasing utility.",
        "A handle including a soft shell for facilitating users to hold is popular in these days, which has a shell and a central shaft. Liquid is filled in the space between both. This known handle may have different connecting structure but all have the same single function for being held comfortably.",
        "The present invention is to provide a soft handle, which connects with a lighting apparatus at one end of the shaft to provide a second function of the handle. Now, accompanying with the following drawings, the character of the present invention will be described here and after.",
        "FIG. 1 is a perspective view showing a soft handle according to the present invention.",
        "FIG. 2 is an exploded perspective view of FIG. 1.",
        "FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional plan view of FIG. 1.",
        "FIG. 4 is a plan view showing the handle turning on the lighting apparatus according to the present invention.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 1 to 3, the present invention includes a soft shell (1), a shaft (2), a top cap (3), and a bottom cap (4), wherein the shaft (2) is placed in the shell (1) while the top cap (3) and the bottom cap (4) are connected to both ends of the shaft (2). Liquid (11) is fulfilled in the space between the shell (1) and the shaft (2) to complete a handle as a prior one. The character of the present invention is to provide a lighting apparatus (5) in one end of the shaft (2). A spring switch (51) is also received in the shaft (2) to control the lighting apparatus (5). The bottom cap (4) is provided with an opening (41).",
        "In use, the handle is still a useful product since the shell (1) with inner sticky liquid (7) is very soft. As soon as lighting purpose is needed, user can just press the spring switch (51) one time to turn on the lighting apparatus (5). The lighting ray emits outside through the opening (41) of the bottom cap (4). The handle becomes like a flashlight. When user presses the spring switch (51) again, he then turns off the lighting apparatus (5). Hence, the present invention obtains utilization and improvement.",
        "Above all, the above-mentioned structures are only embodiments, to illustrate my designs and are not to limit the scope of this application. Any modified embodiment with similar merits is still claimed by the present invention."
