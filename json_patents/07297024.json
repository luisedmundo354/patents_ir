    "abstract": "A metal-wrapped flash-memory-drive device has an integrated slim Universal-Serial-Bus (USB) connector that fits into a standard USB socket. The slim USB connector has 4 metal contacts on a circuit board that is encapsulated by a plastic case. Components are mounted onto the circuit board. A metal wrap conforms to the general shape of a plastic sub-assembly of the plastic case and a plastic cover that enclose the circuit board. The metal wrap can be bent around the plastic sub-assembly in a forming process, or can be pre-formed into a metal tube that the plastic sub-assembly is inserted into. Alignment holes in the metal wrap can fit over plastic stubs on the plastic sub-assembly, or friction can hold the metal wrap to the plastic sub-assembly. The plastic cover and case can be bonded together by molding, ultrasonically, with adhesive films, or using snaps to form the plastic sub-assembly.",

Such USB-flash memory cards do not require a specialized reader but can be plugged into a USB connector on a personal computer (PC) or other hosting device. These USB-flash memory cards can be used in place of floppy disks and are known as USB key drives, USB thumb drives, and a variety of other names. These USB-flash cards can have a capacity of more than ten floppy disks in an area not much larger than a large postage stamp.",

        "Flash memory chip 75 and controller chip 78 are mounted on the reverse (bottom) side of board 60, which can be a multi-layer PCB or similar substrate with wiring traces. The 4 USB contacts are formed on the top side of board 60 and are not visible in this bottom view. Since most components are mounted on the bottom side of board 60 opposite the top side with the USB metal contacts, board 60 does not need a plastic cover over its top side. This allows the flash-memory card to have a lower profile or even a co-planar top surface.",
        "Extension 61 of board 60 has a width that approximately matches the width of the connector substrate and the metal wrap in a male USB connector, about 12.4 mm. Metal USB contacts (not visible) are formed on the top side of extension 61 to act as the USB metal contacts of the male slim USB connector. End 72 of board 60 is inserted into the female USB connector.",
        "Lower case 65 also includes extended region 80. LED 93 can be mounted on board 60, such as on the bottom side with other components, or extending from an edge of board 60.",
        "The width of the USB flash-memory drive may flare beyond extension 61, causing a flared or T-shape to the device. This widening of the USB flash-memory device is undesirable.",
        "While traditional USB connectors have metal wraps around a connector substrate, USB flash-memory drives are often made from plastic housings. A USB flash-memory drive may have a metal wrap around extension 61, but a plastic housing such as lower case 65 around for the remaining portion of the USB device. Having the metal-wrapped connector with the plastic housing may be aesthetically unappealing, and the plastic housing may be less durable than the metal-wrapped USB connector. The USB device may crack and fail due to strain at the metal-plastic interface or join between the metal-wrapped USB connector and the plastic housing.",
        "What is desired is a metal-wrapped USB flash-memory device. A USB flash-memory device with a metal cover extending from the USB connector over the plastic housing is desirable.",

Various modifications to the preferred embodiment will be apparent to those with skill in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments. Therefore, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments shown and described, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features herein disclosed.",
        "The inventors have realized that a metal sheet may be wrapped around the plastic housing of a USB flash-memory device. The metal wrap may have the same cross-sectional area as the USB connector, allowing for a smooth-sided device without joints or strain interfaces between the USB connector and the plastic housing.",
        "FIGS. 2A-D show a narrow USB flash-memory device with a metal wrap. Flash memory chip 77 is a 128 Mega-byte non-volatile memory chip or may have a die with some other capacity and can be packaged in a variety of packages, such a BGA, small-outline, leadless, etc. Controller chip 79 contains a flash-memory controller that generates signals to access memory locations within flash memory chip 77. Controller chip 79 also contains a USB interface controller that serially transfers data to and from flash memory chip 77 over a USB connection.",
        "Flash memory chip 77 can have a small area. For example, a chip having dimensions of 8.5 mm by 13 mm may be used for flash memory chip 77. Since the narrowest dimension, 8.5 mm, is less than the width of the USB connector, 12.4 mm, flash memory chip 77 does not require a widening of board 60. Instead, board 60 can be 12.4 mm wide for its entire length.",

Board 60 can be attached to case 68 by adhesive or by snap fasteners, such as plastic snap pins or tabs in case 68 that fit through and lock into holes in board 60. Adhesive could be a thermal-bond or another type. Supporting ridges 32 in case 68 are located under board 60 near metal contacts 42 to provide additional support to insertion end 72 which forms the USB connector.",
        "Once board 60 is inserted into case 68, and cover 64 is attached, the assembly can be placed in an ultrasonic welding fixture and ultrasonic energy applied. The ultrasonic energy vibrates the parts at high frequency, causing heating at contact points such as ultrasonic ridges (not shown) that can be formed on case 68 or cover 64 at points of contact. These ridges melt under the ultrasonic energy, forming a plastic bonding between case 68 and cover 64.",
        "FIG. 2C shows a metal wrap being formed around the plastic USB assembly. Board 60 and cover 64 have been assembled into case 68 but are hidden from view by case 68. Metal wrap 40 can be a metal sheet that is bent around case 68 by a forming process, such as using pressure and heat. Holes 26 in metal wrap 40 can be provided that fit over stubs 30 that protrude from case 68.",

Metal wrap 40 has been pressed onto the outer surface of case 68 on the top and cover 64 on the bottom so that metal wrap 40 now conforms to the general shape of the plastic assembly of case 68 and cover 64, which enclose board 60. Stubs 30 on case 68 fit into holes 26 in metal wrap 40, helping to align metal wrap 40 to case 68. Additional holes can be provided, such as for the standard USB plug mechanism. End 72 of board 60 is visible in the open end of metal wrap 40.",
        "Metal wrap 40 acts as both the metal wrap of the USB connector, and a metal covering of the plastic assembly (case 68 and cover 64). Seam 22 where the two ends of metal wrap 40 meet can be located on the side rather than the top of case 68 for better visual appearance. Seam 22 can be a straight seam as shown, or can be a serrated or toothed seam.",

In the bottom view of FIG. 3A, board 60 is tilted at an angle to have its USB end inserted into case 68. Then board 60 is pushed flat into case 68 and cover 66 is placed over board 60 to cover the large bottom opening in case 68. LED 38 can be mounted on board 60. Flash memory chip 77 and controller chip 79 are mounted to the bottom surface of board 60 and are protected by case 68.",
        "Protruding snaps 28 on cover 66 fit into snap groves 33 in case 68 when assembled. Cover 66 may fit inside case 68 as shown or may fit around the outside of case 68 in an alternative embodiment. Various types of plastic snaps 28 and mating snap grooves 33 may be formed on case 68 and cover 66. Plastic snap tabs may be semi-flexible plastic extensions or protrusion tabs formed on the edges of cover 66 or case 68 and extend upward or downward. Snap grooves or holes may be formed on the peripheral edges of case 68 and match positions of plastic snap tabs in cover 66, or vice-versa.",
        "Once board 60 is assembled into case 68 and cover 66 snapped in to form the plastic sub-assembly, the plastic sub-assembly is fitted into metal wrap tube 20.

        "In the top view of FIG. 3B, case 68 has a smaller top opening that exposes metal contacts 42 on the top surface of board 60 after assembly. Supporting ridges 32 are visible inside the smaller opening of case 68 and provide mechanical support to the USB connector formed from insertion end 72 of board 60 to prevent damage by rough usage.",
        "A second flash memory chip 75 may be mounted on the top side of board 60 to increase memory storage capacity. The peripheral outline of cover 66 may be somewhat smaller than for case 68 so that cover 66 can fit inside case 68. During assembly, when board 60 is placed inside case 68, the edge of board 60 may be forced into grooves in the side walls of case 68, which can be covered with adhesive or can have snap tabs that snap through holes in board 60 when board 60 is fully inserted into case 68. This locks board 60 into case 68. A variety of shapes can be used for plastic snap tabs and grooves.",
        "In FIG. 3C, the plastic sub-assembly of case 68, board 60, and cover 66 is slid into one open end of metal wrap tube 20. Snaps in cover 66 fit into snap groves 33 in case 68 when forming the plastic sub-assembly.",
        "In this embodiment metal wrap tube 20 can be pre-formed, with seam 22 along the side edge rather than flat top 41 of metal wrap tube 20. This seam placement has a better appearance. Seam 22 has a tooth arrangement in this embodiment, but could be a straight line or have some other shape.",
        "When the sub-assembly is fully inserted into metal wrap tube 20, stubs 30 from case 68 snap into alignment holes 26 on metal wrap tube 20 to lock the plastic sub-assembly into metal wrap tube 20. Flat top 41 can be a part of metal wrap tube 20 or can be an opening in metal wrap tube 20 that exposes case 68.",
        "The open end of metal wrap tube 20 exposes metal contacts 42 on board 60. Insertion end 72 of board 60 forms the substrate part of the USB connector, while the end of metal wrap tube 20 forms the USB connector's metal wrap.

        "Lead-Free-Process Considerations",
        "The element lead (Plumbium, Pb) is indicated as a hazardous material. Legislatives would like to remove this material within a couple of years, such as from the European Union and Japan after January 2008 or earlier.",
        "The traditional USB plug which has plastic substrate during PCBA process will be shrunk and warped at a temperature of about 240\u00b0 C. (peak temp of lead-free solder paste), therefore such a USB plug is not suitable for lead-free process.",
        "The slim USB plug doesn't have the plastic substrate during PCBA process and uses a different PCB material to provide a better temperature resistance to the peak temp of 240\u00b0 C. of the lead-free process. For lead-free processes, surface mount components as well as BGAs don't contain lead in their pins or balls. After the PCBA process, the plastic housing is added and assembled to finish the final product.",
        "Several other embodiments are contemplated by the inventors. For example controller chip 79 could be combined with flash memory chip 77 in a single BGA, small-outline, leadless, or other kind of package. Rather than use a chip package, the flash-memory die could be directly attached to board 60 with die-wire bonding.",
        "An adhesive film can be placed inside cover 66, and the film can be placed inside case 68 before board 60 is fitted into case 68 and cover 66 attached and snapped into place. Protective backing from the films can be peeled off just before attachment, and double-sided adhesive films may be used. Adhesive films may be pressure-sensitive or heat-sensitive, but may not be used in all embodiments, such as when snaps are fully secure.",
        "Rather than use a second molding step to add molded cover 56 to upper opening 83 of plastic casing 87, this second molding step could be skipped. Metal wrap tube 20 could provide sufficient covering for upper opening 83. Alignment holes 26 and stubs 30 may not be needed in all embodiments. Friction between metal wrap tube 20 and the plastic sub-assembly may be sufficient for holding metal wrap tube 20 onto the inner plastic parts.",
        "Additional holes, slots, and other features may be added to the metal wrap or plastic sub-assembly parts. For example, two rectangular USB holes may be added to the top of the USB connector and two more holes may be added to the bottom of the USB connector metal wrap tube near the plug end. These extra holes are present in many USB plugs.",
        "Rather than use the USB device only for flash-memory storage, additional features may be added. For example, a USB music player may include a controller for playing audio from MP3 data stored in the flash memory. An audio jack may be added to the USB device to allow a user to plug in headphones to listen to the music. A wireless transmitter such as a BlueTooth transmitter may be added to the USB device to connect to wireless headphones rather than using the audio jack. Infrared transmitters such as for IrDA may also be added. A BlueTooth transceiver to a wireless mouse, PDA, keyboard, printer, digital camera, MP3 player, or other wireless device may also be added. The BlueTooth transceiver could replace the USB connector as the primary connector. A Bluetooth USB adapter device could have a USB connector, a RF (Radio Frequency) transceiver, a baseband controller, an antenna, a flash memory (EEPROM), a voltage regulator, a crystal, a LED (Light Emitted Diode), resistors, capacitors and inductors. These components may be mounted on the PCB before being enclosed into a plastic or metallic enclosure.",
        "The bottom opening of case 68 may be enlarged so that case 68 is fully open to its perimeter on the bottom. Then cover 56 may be extended to cover this larger opening. Inserting board 60 into case 68 may be easier with the larger opening. The larger opening may also be used in other embodiments. Also, board 60 may not have a cover over it.",
        "Rather than or in addition to snap tabs, adhesive can be used. Pressure or heat sensitive adhesive films can be attached to board 60 or to case 68 where bonding is desired. For example, an adhesive could be brushed on as a liquid or paste, or it could be a double-coated adhesive film such as 3M's 7953 film. A thermal bond film (TBF) such as 3M's TBF-668 could also be used.",
        "Once board 60 and case 68 are pressed together with board 60 in between, the adhesive can be cured by heating the assembly, by pressing the case and board together, or by allowing sufficient time for curing.",
        "Board 60 could also be mounted over the tops of side walls of a lower case. In that variation the edges of board 60 are exposed rather than covered by case 68. In some embodiments board 60 could be the same area or ever larger than case 68, or vice-versa.",
        "Snap-tabs with movable latching teeth or extensions or locking portions may also be used. Different thicknesses and dimensions can be substituted for the examples given. The narrow USB device may have a somewhat varying width, such as within +/\u221220% of the width at the insertion end.",
        "Various design features such as supporting underside ribs or bumps can be added. A variety of materials may be used for the connector substrate, circuit boards, metal contacts, case, etc. Plastic cases can have a variety of shapes and may partially or fully cover different parts of the circuit board and connector, and can form part of the connector itself. Metal covers rather than plastic may be used in some embodiments. Various features can have a variety of shapes and sizes. Oval, round, square, rectangular, trapezoidal, and other shapes may be used.",
        "The slim connector may be widened to accommodate extra metal contacts to become an extended-USB connector for future USB specification. Moreover, the width of the slim connector can be widened, and the height and metal contacts of the slim connector can be varied, making it into a general-purpose slim connector, for USB, extended-USB, PCI Express, mini PCI Express applications, etc.",
        "There are 4 pins in the current USB pin out definition\u2014VCC, GND, D+, and D\u2212. VCC is the 5V power pin. GND is the ground pin and D+ and D\u2212 are the differential data I/O pins. For the USB 2.0 specification, data transfer rates are up to 480M bits/sec, and the power supply current is 500 mA. These might not meet future (or even some current) needs of speed and power associated with some USB devices, such as large flash memory cards.",
        "Additional metal contacts can be added to the new connectors. These additional metal contacts can serve as power, ground, and/or I/O pins which are extensions to the USB specification, or as PCI Express (or mini PCI Express) specifications. Greater power capability can be obtained with (or without) additional power and ground pins (or by a higher power supply current of the existing power pin). Multiple power supplies can also be provided by the additional power and ground pins. The improved power supply capabilities allow more devices and/or more memory chips to be powered. Extra I/O pins can be added for higher bandwidth and data transfer speeds. The additional I/O pins can be used for multiple-bit data I/O communications, such as 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 32, 64, . . . bits. By adopting some or all of these new features, performance of flash memory cards/devices can be significantly improved. These additional pins could be located behind or adjacent to the existing USB pins, or in various other arrangements. The additional pins could be applied to male and female connectors. New types of flash memory cards/devices can be made with these new connectors, which have the additional pins.",
