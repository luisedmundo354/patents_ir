        "The present invention relates to an active device array substrate, a display panel and examining methods thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to an active device array substrate, a liquid crystal display panel having an inner short ring and examining methods thereof.",
        "2. Description of Related Art",
        "In response to the increasing demand of the display, the industry put efforts in the development of the display. Among the displays, the cathode ray tube (CRT) has occupied the display market for many years, due to its high display quality and mature technology. However, the rising \u201cenvironmental protection\u201d awareness against its power consumption and radiation disadvantage, and its limited flattening capability against the market demands of light, thin, short, small, chic, and power-saving displays, have limited the growing space of CRTs. Therefore, the thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD), having superior properties such as high image quality, good space utilization, low power consumption and no radiation, has become the mainstream display product of the market.",
        "The TFT-LCD mainly comprises a liquid crystal display panel and a backlight module. The liquid crystal display panel usually comprises a thin film transistor array substrate, a color filter substrate and a liquid crystal layer disposed between the two substrates. And the backlight module is used to provide a surface light source for the liquid crystal display panel, such that the liquid crystal module may achieve the display effect.",
        "The thin film transistor array substrate may be divided into a display region and a peripheral circuit region, wherein a plurality of pixel units are disposed in an array on the display region, and each of the pixel units comprises a thin film transistor and a pixel electrode connected with the thin film transistor. Moreover, a plurality of scan lines and data lines are disposed in the peripheral circuit region and the display region, wherein the thin film transistor of each pixel unit is controlled by the corresponding scan line and data line.",
        "Usually, after the manufacturing process of the film transistor array substrate, an electrical examination is performed on the pixel units on the thin film transistor array substrate so as to determine whether the pixel units work normally. When the pixel units cannot work normally, the defective components (such as the thin film transistor or the pixel electrode) or the circuit can be repaired. However, in order to examine the pixel units, an examining circuit should be fabricated on the peripheral circuit region of the thin film transistor array substrate. It should be noted that, the examining circuit is complicated, and may reduce the layout region on the panel. Furthermore, after completing the examination, the examining circuits are disabled by a laser cutting technology, so as to avoid affecting the display quality of the liquid crystal display panel.",
        "In addition, electrostatic accumulation may occur in the liquid crystal display panel, due to external factors, such as transportation or environment variation. Therefore, when the charges accumulate to a certain amount, the circuit or the thin film transistor on the thin film transistor array substrate may be damaged due to the electrostatic discharge (ESD). To avoid the problem, an ESD protection circuit is usually disposed in the peripheral circuit region of the thin film transistor array substrate.",
        "However, conventionally, to achieve the above examination and electrostatic protection functions, an examining circuit and an ESD protection circuit should be fabricated simultaneously in the peripheral circuit region of the thin film transistor array substrate. As a result, the layout of the peripheral circuit becomes more complicated, thus resulting in insufficient layout space, which works against the simplification of the manufacturing process and the improvement of the production efficiency.",

        "In the active device array substrate 100, the inner short ring 160 and the third active devices 180 may be used to prevent the electrostatic damage and the data testing lines 150 and the fourth active devices 190 also have the same function. For example, when the electro-static is conducted to the first segment 162, a plurality of third active devices 180 connecting the first segment 162 should be turned on firstly, such that the electro-static may be conducted to the scan line 130. However, only when the voltage of the gates 180g of the third active devices 180 reaches a certain threshold voltage, the sources 180s and the drains 180d can be conducted. Therefore, a part of the electro-static accumulates at the gates 180d of the third active devices 180 and the remaining part will thus be conducted to the scan lines 130. As the first segment 162 of the inner short ring 160 electrically connects with the scan lines 130 by third active devices 180, the electro-static forms several shunts through conduction paths. By starting third active devices 180 and forming several shunts through paths, the static current conducted to each of the scan lines 130 is significantly reduced. In other words, the inner short ring 160 and the third active devices 180 can be used to prevent the partial circuit from the electro-static damage. Therefore, the first active device 172, the second active device 174 and the inner short ring 160 may also be referred to as the ESD protection circuit. Additionally, the first active device 172 and second active device 174 may also be referred to as the ESD protection device. Furthermore, the mechanism of the data testing lines 150 and the fourth active devices 190 to prevent the electrostatic damage is similar to the above, and will not be repeated here. It should be noted that, the first active device 172, the second active device 174 and the inner short ring 160 not only can be used as an ESD protection circuit, but also an examining circuit of the active device array substrate 100. The inner short ring 160, the first active device 1 72 and the second active device 174 are used as an examining circuit, such that the examining circuit and the ESD protection circuit are integrated as a whole, so the layout is simple, the number of the examining pads is reduced and the layout space is large. The data testing lines 150 and the fourth active devices 190 may also be used as an ESD protection circuit, and also as an examining circuit of the active device array substrate 100. Four methods for examining the active device array 100 will be described in detail hereinafter.",
        "The first method for examining the active device array substrate 100 comprises the steps of inputting a first scan signal to the first segment 162 of the inner short ring 160 to start the first active device 172 and the fourth active devices 190, wherein the first scan signal is input to the odd scan lines 130 by part of the third active devices 180; inputting a second scan signal to the second segment 164 of the inner short ring 160, to shut down the second active device 174 and part of the third active devices 180 connecting with the even scan lines 130. It should be noted that, said first scan signal is a high gate voltage (Vgh) signal, and the second scan signal is a low gate voltage (Vgl) signal. Then, the steps further include inputting a first data signal to one of the data testing lines 150, wherein the first data signal is input to the corresponding data lines 130 by part of the fourth active devices 190; and measuring the voltage of the other data testing line 150. When measuring the other data testing line 150, if a voltage signal similar to that of the first data signal is measured, a short circuit may occur between the odd data lines 140 and the even data lines 140.",
        "The second method for examining the active device array substrate 100 comprises the steps of inputting a first scan signal to the first segment 162 of the inner short ring 160; then inputting a second scan signal to the second segment 164 of the inner short ring 160; and measuring the voltage of the data testing lines 150. When said first scan signal is a Vgh signal and the second scan signal is a Vgl signal, the first active device 172 and the fourth active devices 190 will be turned on, and part of the third active devices 180 will also be turned on. In the present embodiment, the started third active devices 180 connect with the odd scan lines 130. When the data testing lines 150 are measured, if one of the data testing lines 150 is measured to have a voltage signal similar to that of the first scan signal, a short circuit occurs between the odd or even data lines 140 and the odd scan lines 130.",
        "As described above, if the measuring result is normal under the above conditions, the first and second scan signals can be changed to be Vgh signals. At that time, one of the data testing lines 150 is measured to determine whether there is a voltage signal similar to the second scan signal or not, in order to judge whether a short circuit occurs between the odd or even data lines 140 and the even scan lines 130. It should be noted that, if the first scan signal is changed to be a Vgl signal and the second scan signal is changed to a Vgh signal directly, one of the data testing lines 150 is measured to determine whether there is a voltage signal similar to that of the first scan signal or not, in order to judge whether a short circuit occurs between the odd or even data lines 140 and the even scan lines 130 or not.",
        "The third method for examining the active device array substrate 100 comprises the steps of inputting a first scan signal to the first segment 162 of the inner short ring 160; inputting a second scan signal to the second segment 164 of the inner short ring 160; and measuring the voltage of the examining line L. If the first scan signal is a Vgh signal and the second scan signal is a Vgl signal, the first active device 172 and the fourth active devices 190 are turned on, and part of the third active devices 180 are also turned on. In the present embodiment, the started third active devices 180 connect with the odd scan lines 130. If the examining line L is measured to have a voltage signal similar to that of the first scan signal, a short circuit occurs between the common lines Cs and the odd scan lines 130.",
        "As described above, if the measuring result is normal under the above conditions, the first and second scan signals may be changed to the Vgh signal. At that time, the examining line L is measured to determine whether is has a voltage signal similar to that of the second scan signal or not, in order to judge whether a short circuit occurs between the common lines Cs and the even scan lines 130. Similarly, if the first scan signal is changed to the Vgl signal and the second scan signal is changed to the Vgh signal directly, the examining line L is measured to determine whether it has a voltage signal similar to that of the first scan signal or not, in order to judge whether a short circuit occurs between the common lines Cs and the even scan lines 130.",
        "The fourth method for examining the active device array substrate comprises the steps of inputting a first scan signal to the first segment 162 of the inner short ring 160; then inputting a second scan signal to the second segment 164 of the inner short ring 160; inputting a first data signal to one of the data testing lines 150, wherein the first data signal is input to the corresponding data lines 140 by part of the fourth active devices 190; and measuring the voltage of the examining line L. Therein, at least one of the first and second scan signals is the Vgh signal. Therefore, the fourth active devices 190 are turned on. If the examining line L is measured to have a voltage signal similar to that of the first data signal, a short circuit occurs between the common lines Cs and the odd or even data lines 140.",

The inner short ring 160 not only can be used to prevent electrostatic damage, but also as an examining circuit of array testing of the active device array substrate 100. By using the methods for examining the active device array substrate 100, the circuit of the active device array substrate 100 can be examined quickly.

        "After inputting the first scan signal, the second scan signal, the first data signal and second data signal to the first segment, the second segment, one of the data testing lines and the other data testing line, the liquid crystal display panel 300 may display many different display images, such as black, white or gray images. The black image may be used to examine whether the bright point or bright line is generated on the liquid crystal display panel 300 or not. The white image may be used to examine whether the dark point or dark line is generated on the liquid crystal display panel 300. And the gray image is usually used to examine whether a mura shows in the display image of the liquid crystal display panel 300.",
        "In addition to the above display images, the liquid crystal display panel 300 may also display an image of bright horizontal or vertical line. Under this display image, it is easy to examine whether the data line 140 or the scan line 130 has defects, such as broken line and short circuit. Furthermore, the liquid crystal display panel 300 further displays an image of bright spot array, and under this image, it is easier to examine the bright point, micro bright point or flash point.",
