        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an integrated chip package structure and method of manufacture the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to an integrated chip package structure and method of manufacture the same using organic substrate.",
        "2. Description of Related Art",
        "In the recent years, the development of advanced technology is on the cutting edge. As a result, high-technology electronics manufacturing industries launch more feature-packed and humanized electronic products These new products that hit the showroom are lighter, thinner, and smaller in design. In the manufacturing of these electronic products, the key component has to be the integrated circuit (IC) chip inside any electronic product.",
        "The operability, performance, and life of an IC chip are greatly affected by its circuit design, wafer manufacturing, and chip packaging. For this present invention, the focus will be on chip packaging technique. Since the features and speed of IC chips are increasing rapidly, the need for increasing the conductivity of the circuitry is necessary so that the signal delay and attenuation of the dies to the external circuitry are reduced. A chip package that allows good thermal dissipation and protection of the IC chips with a small overall dimension of the package is also necessary for higher performance chips. These are the goals to be achieved in chip packaging.",
        "There are a vast variety of existing chip package techniques such as ball grid array (BGA), wire bonding, flip chip, etc . . . for mounting a die on a substrate via the bonding points on both the die and the substrate. The inner traces helps to fan out the bonding points on the bottom of the substrate. The solder balls are separately planted on the bonding points for acting as an interface for the die to electrically connect to the external circuitry. Similarly, pin grid array (PGA) is very much like BGA, which replaces the balls with pins on the substrate and PGA also acts an interface for the die to electrically connect to the external circuitry.",
        "Both BGA and PGA packages require wiring or flip chip for mounting the die on the substrate. The inner traces in the substrate fan out the bonding points on the substrate, and electrical connection to the external circuitry is carried out by the solder balls or pins on the bonding points. As a result, this method fails to reduce the distance of the signal transmission path but in fact increase the signal path distance. This will increase signal delay and attenuation and decrease the performance of the chip.",
        "Wafer level chip scale package (WLCSP) has an advantage of being able to print the redistribution circuit directly on the die by using the peripheral area of the die as the bonding points It is achieved by redistributing an area array on the surface of the die, which can fully utilize the entire area of the die. The bonding points are located on the redistribution circuit by forming flip chip bumps so the bottom side of the die connects directly to the printed circuit board (PCB) with micro-spaced bonding points.",
        "Although WLCSP can greatly reduce the signal path distance, it is still very difficult to accommodate all the bonding points on the die surface as the integration of die and internal components gets higher. The pin count on the die increases as integration gets higher so the redistribution of pins in an area array is difficult to achieve. Even if the redistribution of pins is successful, the distance between pins will be too small to meet the pitch of a printed circuit board (PCB).",
        "Therefore the present invention provides an integrated chip package structure and method of manufacturing the same that uses the original bonding points of the die and connect them to an external circuitry of a thin-film circuit layer to achieve redistribution. The spacing between the redistributed bonding points matches the pitch of a PCB.",
        "In order to achieve the above object, the present invention presents an integrated chip package structure and method of manufacturing the same by adhering the backside of a die to an organic substrate, wherein the active surface of the die has a plurality of metal pads. A thin-film circuit layer is formed on top of the die and the organic substrate, where the thin-film circuit layer has an external circuitry that is electrically connected to the metal pads of the die. The external circuitry extends to a region that is outside the active area of the dies and has a plurality of bonding pads located on the surface of the thin-film layer circuit. The active surface of the die has an internal circuitry and a plurality of active devices, where signals can be transmitted from one active device to the external circuitry via the internal circuitry, then from the external circuitry back to another active device via the internal circuitry. Furthermore, the organic substrate has at least one inwardly protruded area so the backside of the die can be adhered inside the inwardly protruded area and exposing the active surface of the die. Wherein the organic substrate is composed of an organic layer and a heat conducting material formed overlapping and the inwardly protruded areas are formed by overlapping the organic substrate with openings on the heat conducting layer. Furthermore, the present chip package structure allows multiple dies with same or different functions to be packaged into one integrated chip package and permits electrically connection between the dies by the external circuitry.",

The fabrication of the organic substrates can be accomplished by existing printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication technique. The method includes heat pressing a plurality of insulating core boards or injection molding to form organic substrate 110.",
        "A plurality of dies 120 having an active surface 122 and a corresponding backside 124 is provided, where the active devices are formed on active surface 122 of dies 120. Furthermore, dies 120 have a plurality of metal pads 126 located on active surface 122 of dies 120 acting as the output terminal of dies 120 to transmit signals to the external circuitry. Backside 124 of dies 120 is adhered to surface 112 of organic substrate 110 by a conductive paste or adhesive tape. Therefore, active surface 122 of dies 120 is facing upwards along surface 112 of organic substrate 110.",
        "Please refer to FIG. 1B, when adhering die 120 to organic substrate 110, a filling layer 130 is formed on top of surface 112 of organic substrate 110 surrounding the peripheral of dies 120 to fill the gap between dies 120. Wherein the top face of filling layer 130 is approximately planar to active surface 122 of dies 120. The material of filling layer 130 can be epoxy, polymer, or the like. After curing of filling layer 130, a grinding or etching process is applied to planarize filling layer 130 so the top face of filling layer 130 is planar to active surface 122 of dies 120.",
        "Please refer to FIG. 1C, after the formation of filling layer 130 on organic substrate 110, a dielectric layer 142 is formed on top of filling layer 130 and active surface 122 of dies 120. Dielectric layer 142 is patterned according to metal pads 126 on dies 120 to form thru-holes 142a. The material of dielectric layer 142 can be poly-Imide (PI), benzocyclobutene (BCB), porous dielectric material, stress buffer material, or the like. Patternization of dielectric layer 142 can be performed by photo via, laser ablation, plasma etching, or the like.",
        "Please continue to refer to FIG. 1C, filling layer 130 is used to support dielectric layer 142 so dielectric layer 142 can be formed planarized on top of organic substrate 110 and dies 120 without an uneven surface. As a result, after dielectric layer 142 is formed on surface 112 of organic substrate 110 and active surface 122 of dies 120, dielectric layer 142 also fills the peripheral of dies 120, meaning the gap between dies 120. Therefore the bottom structure of dielectric layer 142 can replace the structure of filling layer 130 covering entirely surface 112 of organic substrate 110 and surrounding dies 120. The method of forming dielectric layer 142 includes first depositing a layer of dielectric layer 142 entirely over dies 120 and organic substrate 110, then after curing, grinding or etching process is performed to planarize dielectric layer 142.",
        "Please refer to FIG. 1D, after forming dielectric layer 142 and patterning dielectric layer 142 to form thru-holes 142a, a patterned wiring layer 144 is formed on top of dielectric layer 142 by photolithography and sputtering, electroplating, or electro-less plating. Wherein part of the conductive material from patterned wiring layer 144 will be injected into thru-holes 142a to form vias 142b, copper (Cu) is used as the material for patterned wiring layer 144. Moreover, thru-holes 142a can be pre-filled with a conductive material such as a conductive glue to form vias 142b. Therefore no matter if the thru-holes are filled with the conductive material from patterned wiring layer 144 or pre-filled with a conductive material, patterned wiring layer 144 is electrically connected to metal pads 126 of dies 120. It is to be noted that part of patterned wiring layer 144 extends to a region outside active surface 122 of dies 120. Dielectric layer 142 and patterned wiring layer 144 form a thin-film circuit layer 140.",
        "Please refer to FIG. 1E, after the formation of patterned wiring layer 144, another dielectric layer 146 can be formed similarly to dielectric layer 142 on top of dielectric layer 142 and patterned wiring layer 144. Dielectric layer 146 is also patterned to form thru-holes 146a, whereas thru-holes 146a correspond to bonding pads 144a of patterned wiring layer 144.",
        "Please refer to FIG. 1F, after the formation and patternization of dielectric layer 146 to form thru-holes 146a, a patterned wiring layer 148 can be formed on dielectric layer 146 in a similar way as patterned wiring layer 144. Wherein part of the conductive material from patterned wiring layer 148 will be injected into each thru-hole 146a for forming a via 146b. By the same token, patterned wiring layer 148 is electrically connected to patterned wiring layer 144 by vias 146b, and further electrically connected to metal pads 126 of die 120 by vias 142b of thru-hole 142a. Therefore, thin-film circuit layer 140 further comprises dielectric layer 146, a plurality of vias 146b, and patterned wiring layer 148.",
        "Please continue to refer to FIG. 1F, in order to redistribute all metal pads 126 of dies 120 on organic substrate 110, the number of patterned wiring layers (144, 148 . . . ) and dielectric layers (142, 146 . . . ) for electrical insulation may be increased. All patterned wiring layers (144, 148 . . . ) are electrically connected by vias (146b . . . ) of thru-holes (146a . . . ). However if only the first patterned wiring layer 144 is required to entirely redistribute metal pads 126 of dies 120 on organic substrate 110, extra dielectric layers (146 . . . ) and patterned wiring layers (148 . . . ) will no longer be required in the structure. In other words, thin-film circuit layer 140 comprises at least one dielectric layer 142, one patterned wiring layer 144, and a plurality of vias 142b. Wherein patterned wiring layer (144, 148 . . . ) and vias (142b, 146b . . . ) of thin-film circuit layer 140 form an external circuitry of thin-film circuit layer 140.",
        "Please refer to FIG. 1G, after the formation of patterned wiring layer 148, a patterned passivation layer 150 is formed on top of dielectric layer 146 and patterned wiring layer 148. Patterned passivation layer 150 is used to protect patterned wiring layer 148 and expose the plurality of bonding pads 148a of patterned wiring layer 148, whereas some of bonding pads 148a are in a region outside active surface 122 of dies 120. As previously mentioned, the redistribution of metal pads 126 on organic substrate 110 requires multiple layers of patterned wiring layers (144, 148 . . . ) and a patterned passivation layer 150 formed on the very top, which is furthest away from organic substrate 110. However, if only patterned wiring layer 144 is required to redistribute all metal pads 126 of dies 120 on organic substrate 110, patterned passivation layer 150 will be formed directly on patterned wiring layer 144. The material of patterned passivation layer 150 can be anti-solder insulating coating or other insulating material.",
        "Please refer to FIG. 1H, after the formation of patterned passivation layer 150, a bonding point 160 can be placed on bonding pads 148a serving as an interface for electrically connecting dies 120 to the external circuitry. Wherein bonding point 160 illustrated in FIG. 1H is a ball but it is not limited to any formation, which might include a bump, pin, or the like. Wherein ball connector maybe solder ball, and bump connector maybe solder bump, gold bump, or the like.",
        "Please refer to FIG. 1I, after the formation of bonding points 160 on bonding pads 148a, a singularization process of packaged die 120 by mechanical or laser cutting is performed along the dotted line as indicated in the diagram.

        "According to the above, the first embodiment of the present invention is a chip package structure with an organic substrate and a plurality of dies on the organic substrate. The external circuitry of the thin-film circuit layer allows the metal pads of the die to fan out. By forming bonding pads corresponding to the metal pads of the dies such as solders balls, bumps, or pins as the signal input terminals, the distance of the signal path is effectively decreased. As a result, signal delay and attenuation are reduced to increase performance of the die.",

Alternatively, the organic substrate can also be fabricated in large volume by injection molding. As a result of the low fabrication and material cost of the organic substrate, the cost of chip packaging is also lowered.",
        "The second embodiment of the present invention differs from the first embodiment by having inwardly protruded areas in the organic substrate.

The depth of each inwardly protruded area 214 is approximately equal to the thickness of die 220, therefore the outline and depth of inwardly protruded areas 214 will be the same as dies 220 in FIG. 2C. In FIG. 2C, backside 224 of dies 220 is adhered to the bottom of inwardly protruded areas 214 so dies 220 are inlayed in inwardly protruded areas 214.

Although the thickness of the active devices and traces (not shown) on active surface 422 of die 420 is much less than that of die 420, the thickness of die 420 should not be too small because cracks or damage to the die will occur during machine handling. However the present invention directly adheres active surface 422 of dies 420 to first surface 412 of organic substrate 410 without further machine handling. Afterwards a grinding process is performed on backside 424 of dies 420 to reduce the thickness of dies 420.
