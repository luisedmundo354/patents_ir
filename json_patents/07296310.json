        "This invention pertains to a foundation for a mattress in which the height of the foundation can be adjusted.",
        "A mattress foundation is an integral part of most beds. The foundation serves to distribute loads applied to the mattress which, in turn, can make the mattress feel more comfortable and prolong its life relative to a mattress that is not supported by a foundation. While the mattress foundation serves these important purposes, existing foundations suffer from several limitations inherent to their design.",
        "For example, assembled foundations often occupy a rather large volume, much of which is empty space unoccupied by the springs or frame members that provide structure to the foundation. Thus, when the assembled foundations are shipped to distributors or customers, much of the \u201cfreight\u201d that is hauled from the manufacturer is actually just air. This waste decreases the number of assembled foundations that can be shipped using a finite capacity and, accordingly, the cost associated with this finite shipping capacity is spread among fewer foundations.",
        "Also, typical mattress foundations are made from fixed frames whose dimensions cannot be adjusted. Therefore, the height of the foundation, which will impact the overall height of the bed (i.e., stacked mattress and foundation), cannot be adjusted. However, customers may wish, for various aesthetic and functional considerations, to have the ability to select from a number of different bed heights. In order to provide this option using typical mattress foundations, the manufacturer must produce and the distributor or retailer must stock several different foundations, each having a different height, for a given bed. The increased/custom manufacturing capacity and increased inventory necessary to provide this option to consumers would further increase the cost of each foundation.",
        "A need therefore exits for a mattress foundation that can be provided at different heights, thereby permitting the overall height of a bed utilizing the foundation to be varied. A need also remains for a mattress foundation whose overall volume can be reduced during shipping, thereby permitting more foundations to be shipped using a finite capacity. The invention provides such a mattress foundation. These and other advantages of the invention, as well as additional inventive features, will be apparent from the description of the invention provided herein.",
        "The invention provides a foundation for a mattress. The foundation comprises (a) a lower frame having a top, a bottom, a perimeter, and one or more lower frame members disposed around at least a portion of the perimeter of the lower frame, (b) an upper frame having a top, a bottom, a perimeter, and one or more upper frame members disposed around at least a portion of the perimeter of the upper frame, and (c) a plurality of movable supports attached to one or more of the lower frame member and the upper frame member. The movable supports are adapted to maintain the upper frame and the lower frame in spaced apart relation and to permit vertical movement of the upper frame into a plurality of spaced apart relations relative to the lower frame.",
        "The upper and lower frames can have any suitable configuration. For example, the upper and lower frames can be substantially rectangular in shape. In such an embodiment, the foundation preferably comprises at least four movable supports, one of which is disposed in each corner of the upper frame or the lower frame.",
        "In certain embodiments, the movable supports comprise a support member and a receiving member. The receiving member is attached to the lower frame member and/or the upper frame member and is adapted to receive the support member and restrict lateral movement of the support member relative to the upper frame and the lower frame. The support member can have any suitable configuration. However, in a preferred embodiment, the support member is substantially rectangular in shape and has a length, a width, and a height, all of which are unequal.",

While the support members and receiving members depicted in FIGS. 3-5B are shown with keys made from materials that are different from the rest of the support member or receiving member, the keys can be made from the same materials as the rest of the support member or receiving member. For example, the support members or receiving members, including any keys disposed thereon, can be machined from the same piece of wood, metal, plastic, or foam.",
        "In certain embodiments, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the foundation 100 can comprise a cover 110 that masks the upper frame 104, the lower frame 102, and movable supports 106, 107 from view. In particular, the cover 110 has a top portion 160 and a side portion 162. As shown in FIG. 1, the cover 110, more specifically the top portion of the cover, rests on the top of the upper frame 104. When the cover 110 rests on the top 120 of the upper frame 104, the side portion 162 of the cover 110 extends around at least a portion of the perimeter of the upper frame 104, thereby masking the frames 102, 104 and support members 106, 107 of the foundation 100 from view. As shown in FIG. 10, the cover 110 can further comprise a bottom portion 164 having a perimeter and a resilient material 166 (e.g., an elastic band) attached to the perimeter of the bottom portion 164 of the cover 110. In such an embodiment, the side portion (not shown) of the cover 110 extends around at least a portion of the perimeter of the lower frame 102 and the bottom portion 164 of the cover 110 contacts the bottom 114 of the lower frame 102. The cover can be made from any suitable material. For example, the cover can be a textile material, such as a knit, woven, or non-woven textile. The cover can be provided in any suitable configuration that is capable of covering the top of the upper frame and masking the frames and movable supports of the foundation from view. For example, the cover can be provided in a configuration similar to that of a fitted sheet typically used to cover a mattress. Such an embodiment of the cover is depicted in FIG. 10. In an alternative embodiment of the cover depicted in FIG. 10, the resilient material can be replaced with a drawstring that gathers the excess portions of the cover as it is pulled.",
        "In order to support a load resting on the foundation, the foundation 100 can, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, further comprise a resilient support 108 that is attached via suitable means to the top 120 of the upper frame 104. The resilient support can comprise any suitable material(s) that is capable of carrying a load applied to the foundation without permanent deformation or failure. For example, the resilient support can comprise a textile, such as a woven or knit textile comprising elastomeric yarns. Alternatively, the resilient support can be comprised of a plurality of metallic wires or rods which are disposed in a substantially parallel relation. In such an embodiment, the wires or rods pass from one side of the upper frame to an opposing side of the upper frame. The wires or rods can be provided with a substantially sinusoidal shape along a portion or substantially all of their length. In order to provide further rigidity and resistance to deformation, adjacent wires or rods can be connected using springs or other suitable connection means so that a load applied to the one of the wires or rods is, at least partially, distributed to the adjacent wires or rods.",
        "The foundation of the invention can be used to support any suitable mattress. For example, the foundation of the invention can be used to support an innerspring mattress, a foam mattress, or an air mattress.",
