        "The visible light range is the range (optical range) of the electromagnetic spectrum having light (electromagnetic radiation) visible to human eyes. The visible light range includes any light having a wavelength between about 400 nm (nanometers) and about 700 nm. The non-visible light range is the range of the entire electromagnetic spectrum minus the visible light range. Some examples of the non-visible light range include electromagnetic radiations with wavelengths between 700 nm and one millimeter (infrared light), wavelengths between 10 nm and 400 nm (ultraviolet light), and wavelengths between 0.01 nm and 10 nm (X-ray).",
        "In this specification, the amorphous carbon layer is transparent in visible light range means that the amorphous carbon layer has a substantially low extinction coefficient (k) in which k has a range between about 0.15 and about 0.001 at wavelength of 633 nm. In some embodiments, the amorphous carbon layer transparent in visible light range is an amorphous carbon layer formed at a temperature from about 150\u00b0 C. to about 500\u00b0 C. such that the amorphous carbon layer has an extinction coefficient (k) between about 0.15 and about 0.001 at wavelength of 633 nm.",
        "At box 102 of method 100 in FIG. 1A, a wafer is placed in a chamber. In some embodiments, the chamber is a chemical vapor deposition chamber and the wafer is a semiconductor wafer. In embodiments represented by FIG. 1A, the chamber is a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) chamber.",
        "At box 104, the parameters are set for the process of forming an amorphous carbon layer according to the invention. The parameters include temperature, gas mixture, gas flow rate, power, and pressure. The temperature in the chamber is set to a selected temperature. The selected temperature is any temperature from about 150\u00b0 C. to about 500\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, the temperature is set between about 200\u00b0 C. and below 300\u00b0 C. In other embodiments, the temperature is set between about 225\u00b0 C. and about 375\u00b0 C.",
        "In the process of forming an amorphous carbon layer, a process gas including propylene (C3H6) is introduced into the chamber at a flow rate. In some embodiments, the flow rate of the propylene is set between about 500 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) and about 3000 sccm. An additional gas including helium may be also introduced into the chamber at a flow rate. In some embodiments, the flow rate of the helium is set between about 250 sccm and about 1000 sccm. Further, embodiments exist where at least one of the other hydrocarbon gases is used as the process gas. Examples of the other hydrocarbon gases include CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H8. Helium may also be used in combination with at least one of these hydrocarbon gases. Thus, in box 104, a gas mixture is introduced into the chamber.",
        "In this specification, the gas mixture may be either one gas only or a combination of at least two gases. For example, the gas mixture may be either propylene (C3H6) only or a combination of propylene and helium. As another example, the gas mixture may be at least one of the propylene, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H8. As a further example, the gas mixture may be at least one of the propylene, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H8 plus helium.",
        "During the process of forming the amorphous carbon layer in method 100, the chamber is subjected to a radio frequency (RF) power and a pressure. In some embodiments, the radio frequency power is set between about 450 Watts and about 1000 Watts, and the pressure is set between about 3.0 Torr and about 7.0 Torr.",
        "In box 106, an amorphous carbon layer is formed as a deposited layer over the wafer. The amorphous carbon layer is transparent in visible light range. In some embodiments, the amorphous carbon layer formed by method 100 has an extinction coefficient (k) between about 0.15 and about 0.001 at wavelength of 633 nm.",
        "Since the amorphous carbon layer formed by method 100 is transparent in visible light range, the amorphous carbon layer formed by method 100 is also referred to as a transparent amorphous carbon layer. Thus, the transparent amorphous carbon layer refers to an amorphous carbon layer formed according method 100 in which the temperature is set from about 150\u00b0 C. to about 500\u00b0 C.",
        "The transparency of the amorphous carbon layer formed by method 100 depends in part on the temperature set during the process. In method 100, the transparency of the amorphous carbon layer formed to a specific thickness at a lower temperature is more transparent than the amorphous carbon layer formed to that specific thickness at a higher temperature. For example, in method 100, the amorphous carbon layer formed to a thickness at 150\u00b0 C. is more transparent than the amorphous carbon layer formed to the same thickness at 500\u00b0 C.",
        "The transparent amorphous carbon layer formed by method 100 may be used in semiconductor devices such as memory devices and microprocessors. For example, the transparent amorphous carbon layer formed by method 100 may be included in a structure of semiconductor devices as an insulating layer or an antireflective layer. As another example, the transparent amorphous carbon layer formed by method 100 may also be used as a mask in an etching process during manufacturing of semiconductor devices.",

        "In various embodiments, an amorphous carbon layer, which is substantially transparent, for use in a electronic device or for processing an electronic device as described herein may be formed using a process gas containing carbon and a spreading gas. The process gas provides the carbon for the amorphous carbon layer formed, while the spreading gas assists in providing film uniformity for the carbon layer. The process gas includes a carbon-based gas. In an embodiment, the carbon-based gas may include, but is not limited to, one or more carbon containing gases such as C3H6, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H8, C3H4, and C4H10. In an embodiment, the process gas includes carbon without oxygen in the gas flow. Having oxygen in the gas flow providing an oxygenating environment may allow the oxygen to bum the carbon out and not form the desired carbon layer. Thus, an embodiment includes a process gas that contains carbon but does not contain substantial oxygen. In various embodiments, the process gas is introduced into a processing system along with a spreading gas.",
        "A spreading gas is a gas that aids in spreading a process gas across a wafer being processed to uniformly grow a material layer. The spreading gas does not substantially interact with the process gas such that a desired carbon layer is formed without substantial residual from the spreading gas included in the amorphous carbon layer. In an embodiment, the spreading gas acts as a carrier gas for the process gas. A carrier gas aids in transporting a process gas through a system to the location at which the process gas interacts based on the parameters of the process being performed. Spreading gases for use in various embodiments include, but are not limited to, one or more of helium, nitrogen, ammonia (NH3), and argon mixed with nitrogen.",
        "In an embodiment, a process gas and a spreading gas are introduced into an RF processing system to form an amorphous carbon layer that is substantially transparent. The RF system may operate at 13.6 megahertz. The RF system configured to operate at 13.6 megahertz may also operate at another frequency, such as a lower frequency, during the same fabrication procedure. Alternately, the RF system may operate at one or more other frequencies. The RF energy provided to the process gas and the spreading gas generates a plasma. The presence of the spreading gas allows the plasma to expand out, thereby spreading over the wafer farther than if the spreading gas were not used. The choice of spreading gas used may also affect parameters other than the uniformity of the amorphous carbon layer deposited in the process.",
        "In an embodiment using nitrogen as a spreading gas, nitrogen improves the plasma properties and deposition rate for the carbon layer such that the carbon film can deposit faster than would occur without the nitrogen. In embodiment for forming a substantially transparent amorphous carbon layer, nitrogen is introduced into an RF process chamber at a flow rate ranging from about 500 sccm to about 3000 sccm, where the flow rate for propylene, C3H6, as the process gas ranges from about 1000 sccm to about 3000 sccm. The process chamber is at a pressure ranging from about 2.8 Torr to about 7 Torr with the RF power ranging from about 450 watts to about 1000 watts for an electrode spacing ranging from about 190 mils to about 450 mils. The process is performed at a temperature ranging from about 150\u00b0 C. to about 450\u00b0 C.",
        "In an embodiment for forming a substantially transparent amorphous carbon layer, helium is used as a spreading gas with C3H6 as the process gas under the same parameters as nitrogen. The helium is introduced into the RF process chamber at a flow rate ranging from about 200 sccm to about 1500 sccm. In another embodiment, ammonia is used as a spreading gas with C3H6 as the process gas. The ammonia is introduced into the RF process chamber at a flow rate ranging from about 50 sccm to about 200 sccm. Using ammonia as a spreading gas would reduce the evaporate/deposition properties, but aid in improving uniformity of the amorphous carbon layer.",
        "A substantially transparent amorphous carbon layer formed using a processing gas and a spreading gas can be formed with any thickness depending on the application. In an embodiment, a substantially transparent amorphous carbon layer has a thickness of about 1500 Angstroms. In another embodiment, a substantially transparent amorphous carbon layer has a thickness of about 2000 Angstroms. In other embodiments, a substantially transparent amorphous carbon layer has a thickness of at least 4000 Angstroms. In various embodiments using a processing gas and a spreading gas to form a substantially transparent amorphous carbon layer, the amorphous carbon layer may have a thickness that ranges from about 1000 Angstroms to about 12000 Angstroms.",
        "In various embodiments, an amorphous carbon layer that is substantially transparent is processed using a process gas and a spreading gas at temperatures ranging from about 150\u00b0 C. to about 450\u00b0 C. Increased transparency for an amorphous carbon layer is attained at temperatures in the lower end of this temperature range. In an embodiment for processing an electronic device in which various processes other than the formation of a carbon layer is performed at about 375\u00b0 C., the formation of the carbon layer is also performed at this temperature.",
        "Various embodiments of the invention provide techniques to form a transparent amorphous carbon layer. The transparent amorphous carbon layer can be used as a mask for etching certain structure of the device. The amorphous carbon layer can also be a part of a structure of the device for other purposes. In various embodiments, an amorphous carbon layer that is substantially transparent is formed using a process gas containing carbon and a spreading gas to aid in improving the uniformity of the amorphous carbon layer.",
