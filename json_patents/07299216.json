    "abstract": "A method and apparatus that catalogs the characteristics and scheduling of multiple ETL procedures or processes as the multiple ETL procedures extract, transform data from a first database to load the data to a second database. The method and apparatus catalogs the progress and success of execution of multiple ETL procedures. The method and apparatus determines the necessary scheduling for cleansing operations of the first database, then initiates the cleansing operation of the first database, and then catalogs the progress of a cleansing process performed on a database to eliminate inconsistencies, redundancies, and corruptions of the database. The method and apparatus determines any errors in the execution of the ETL procedures and transmits an error message describing the errors to a person.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to database systems. More particularly, the present invention pertains to apparatus and methods for supervision of data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) procedures in data warehousing and data mart applications.",
        "2. Description of Related Art",
        "A data warehouse, as is known in the art, is a central repository for all or significant parts of the data that an enterprise's various business systems collect. Typically, a data warehouse is housed on an enterprise server computing system. Data from various processing applications and other sources is selectively extracted and organized on the data warehouse database for use by analytical applications and user queries. Data extracted and organized from a data warehouse is often placed in a data mart. A data mart is a repository of data gathered from operational data and other sources such a data warehouse that is designed to serve a particular group of people requiring the information.",
        "It is known in the art that in managing databases, extract, transform, and load (ETL) refers to three separate functions combined into a single program procedure. First, the extract function reads data from a specified source database and extracts a desired subset of data. Next, the transform function works with the acquired data\u2014using rules or lookup tables, or creating combinations with other data\u2014to convert it to the desired state. Finally, the load function is used to write the resulting data (either all of the subset or just the changes) to a target database, which may or may not previously exist.",
        "ETL procedures can be used to acquire a temporary subset of data for reports or other purposes, or a more permanent data set may be acquired for other purposes such as: the population of a data mart or data warehouse; conversion from one database type to another, and the migration of data from one database or platform to another.",
        "The definitions of the data warehouse, data mart and ETL procedures were found 7/3/2002, at www.searchDatabase.com.",
        "Refer now to FIG. 1 for a description of a database processing system of the prior art. Programming applications 10a, 10b, . . . 10n are executed by computer processors to create data that is stored in specific databases in database storage units 15a, 15b, . . . , 15n. The programming applications 10a, 10b, . . . 10n are applications such as On-Line Transaction Programs (OLTP), where customers are able to create data such as purchases or sale order entry. The ETL procedures 25a, 25b, 25c, . . . , 25n are executed by the computer processors to remove data from the databases in the database storage units 15a, 15b, . . . , 15n, transform the data to the desired state and format, and loading of the transformed data to the data warehouse 40.",
        "Historical data generated by older computer systems is maintained on a \u201clegacy database\u201d in a separate database storage unit 20. The legacy database similarly is extracted, transformed, and loaded by the legacy ETL procedure 30 to the data warehouse 40 for integration with the currently generated data from the program applications 10a, 10b, . . . 10n.",
        "In order to prevent the database information within the database storage units from being modified and potentially corrupted, an operational data storage (ODS) staging unit 35 is employed by the ETL procedures 25a, 25b, 25c, . . . , 25n, and 30 as a staging database retention device. The ETL procedures 25a, 25b, 25c, . . . , 25n, and 30 perform the transformations of the data from the database storage units 15a, 15b, . . . , 15n, and 20 prior to placement of the data to the data warehouse 40.",
        "The ETL procedures 25a and 25b illustrate that multiple ETL procedures may be performed on a database from a single database storage unit 15a, 15b, . . . , 15n,. The transformation portion of the ETL procedure performs different conversions to the database for placement in the data warehouse 40. To improve the quality of the database or segment of the database being extracted from each of the database storage units 15a, 15b, . . . , 15n, a cleansing process is executed to eliminate any inconsistencies, redundancies, and corruptions from the data being extracted. The cleansing process may be a separate program executed by the computer processor or a sub-procedure of the ETL procedure 25a, 25b, . . . , 25n.",
        "The data marts 50a, 50b, . . . 50n are databases within database storage units that are created to serve a particular group requiring an individualized database. The ETL procedures 45a, 45b, . . . , 45n create and maintain of the data marts 50a, 50b, . . . 50n by extracting the necessary data from the data warehouse 40, transforming the data to meet the particular group requirements, and storing the data in databases 50a, 50b, . . . 50n retained in database storage units.",
        "As is apparent, large enterprises may have many databases stored on database storage units 15a, 15b, . . . , 15n, 20, and 50a, 50b, . . . 50n . To create and maintain one or more data warehouses, many ETL procedures 25a, 25b, 25c, . . . , 25n are executed periodically to extract, transform, and load the data from the data storage units 15a, 15b, . . . , 15n to the data warehouse 40. The ETL procedures 45a, 45b, . . . , 45n then create and maintain the data within the data marts 50a, 50b, . . . 50n . The quality, effectiveness, and success of each of the ETL procedures 25a, 25b, 25c, . . ., 25n, 30, 45a, 45b, . . . , and 45n is monitored and the success or failure communicated individually. There is no central repository of the status of the ETL procedures 25a, 25b, 25c, . . . , 25n, 30, 45a, 45b, . . . , and 45n as a whole.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 6,208,990 (Suresh, et al.) teaches a computer software architecture to automatically optimize the throughput of data extraction/transformation/loading (ETL) process in data warehousing applications. This architecture has a component aspect and a pipeline-based aspect. The component aspect refers to the fact that every transformation used in this architecture is built up with transformation components selected from an extensible set of transformation components. Besides simplifying source code maintenance and adjustment for the data warehouse users, these transformation components also provide these users the building blocks to effectively construct pertinent and functionally sophisticated transformations in a pipelined manner. Within a pipeline, each transformation component automatically stages or streams its data to optimize ETL throughput. Furthermore, each transformation either pushes data to another transformation component, pulls data from another transformation component, or performs a push/pull operation on the data. Thereby, the pipelining; staging/streaming; and pushing/pulling features of the transformation components effectively optimizes the throughput of the ETL procedure.",
        "U.S. Pat. No 6,189,004 (Rassen, et al.) demonstrates a method and apparatus for creating a data mart and for creating a query structure for the data mart. The method automatically defines a query interface for a data mart. The data mart includes fact and dimension tables. The method comprises accessing a schema description and a query interface description for the data mart. The schema description specifies a schema, which in turn, defines the relationships between the fact tables and dimension tables of the data mart. The query interface description specifies the fields, related to the schema description, which can be used in a query and the way in which results are to be presented to the user. The fields correspond to columns and rows in the fact tables. The schema description is used to create a first set of commands to create and populate the fact and dimension tables. Additionally, a second set of commands to create the query interface is created. Some commands of the first set of commands are executed causing the creation and population of the tables. Some commands of the second set of commands are executed causing the creation of a user interface. A query is generated using the user interface. The query is sent to the system for processing. The results of the query are presented to the user according the second set of commands.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 6,151,608 (Abrams) describes a method and system for migrating data from one or more ASCII files and/or from one or more relational databases to one or more relational database tables without the need to write code. Abrams allows the user to define mapping templates and conditionals to assist in translating and transforming data values. Referential integrity, data dependencies, order of operations, and uniqueness constraints are enforced using a predefined set of migration rules templates that are based on the principles of relational design. The mapping and migration rules templates are used to intelligently generate instructions for updating or populating relational database destination tables. The instructions control the data transfer, data translation, data transformation, data validation, foreign key insertion, and the addition of required codes and flags in the destination tables. A migration engine of the system includes a data map architect and an update processor, which spawns the templates and migrates the data dynamically, utilizing the data definitions for the destination tables. In addition to supporting conversion efforts, Support for performing consolidation, restoration from an archive, migration to new instances, upgrading to a new release, adding additional features and enhancements, and changing business requirements is provided. The audit trail is complete enough that the entire migration process can be reversed without compromising the integrity of either the source or the destination application.",
        "\u201cHow to Select an Extraction/Transformation/Loading (ETL) Tool\u201d, Mimno, 101communications LLC, Chatsworth, Calif. 91311, found 6/27/2002 www.101dataintelligencesolutions.com, provides techniques for selecting an appropriate ETL tool. The ETL tool operates at the heart of the data warehouse, extracting data from multiple data sources, transforming the data to make it accessible to business analysis, and loading multiple target databases. Unlike other components of a data warehousing architecture, it's extremely difficult to switch from one ETL tool to another. Because of a lack of standards, data definitions and transformation rules cannot be moved from one tool to another. If the selected ETL tool fails in production, it is the one component of the architecture that isn't easily replaceable.",

The method then logs procedure records for the ETL procedure detailing characteristics and scheduling of the ETL procedure. The method continues with logging control records for the ETL procedure detailing status of the ETL procedure. A scheduling for cleansing the first database is determined from the ETL procedure. At a time, when the cleansing is scheduled to be executed, the first database is cleansed to eliminate inconsistencies, redundancies, and corruptions from the first database. Finally the method logs a cleansing record for the ETL procedure detailing a cleansing schedule for the first database.",

        "In large enterprises that may have many databases stored on database storage units, multiple ETL procedures are executed periodically to extract, transform, and load the data from the data storage units to the data warehouse to create and maintain one or more databases and from the data warehouse to create and maintain the data marts. An ETL supervisor provides the control, monitoring, and cleaning necessary for coordinating and administering the databases and data marts of the enterprise.",
        "The ETL supervisor determines the scheduling of the ETL procedures and initiates the execution of the ETL procedures at the appropriate schedule to extract, transform data from a first database to a second database. During the execution of the ETL procedures, the ETL supervisor determines the progress of the ETL procedure and catalogs the progress and success of execution of the multiple ETL procedures. As the ETL supervisor controls the ETL procedures, the ETL supervisor catalogs the characteristics and scheduling of the multiple ETL procedures. A sub-process of the ETL procedures, generally, indicates a scheduling for the cleansing of the first database to eliminate inconsistencies, redundancies, and corruptions. The ETL supervisor extracts the scheduling of the cleansing process and at the appropriate time executes the cleansing process. The key information of the cleansing process is logged for future reference.",
        "The ETL supervisor logs any failures in the execution of the ETL procedures. The ETL supervisor reviews the logged failures and, if the failures are sufficiently severe, The ETL supervisor transmits a message to a responsible person detailing the failure.",
        "Refer now to Fig. 2 for a discussion of the database system and the function of the ETL supervisor of this invention. Similar to the database processing systems of the prior art, the programming applications 110a, 110b, . . . 110n are executed on computer processors to create data that is stored in specific databases in database storage units 115a, 115b, . . . , 115n. The ETL procedures 125a, 125b, 125c, . . . , 125n are executed by the computer processors to remove data from the databases in the database storage units 115a, 115b, . . . , 115n, transform the data to the desired state and format, and loading of the transformed data to the data warehouse 140.",
        "Historical data generated by older computer systems is maintained on a \u201clegacy database\u201d in a separate database storage unit 120. The legacy database similarly is extracted, transformed, and loaded by the legacy ETL procedure 130 to the data warehouse 140 for integration with the currently generated data from the program applications 110a, 110b, . . . 110n.",
        "In order to prevent the database information within the database storage units 115a,115b, . . . , 115n, and 120 from being modified and potentially corrupted, an operational data storage (ODS) staging unit 135 is employed by the ETL procedures 125a, 125b, 125c, . . . , 125n, and 130 as a staging database retention device. The ETL procedures 125a, 125b, 125c, . . . , 125n, and 130 perform the transformations of the data from the database storage units 115a, 115b, . . . , 115n, and 120 prior to placement of the data to the data warehouse 140.",
        "The ETL procedures 125a and 125b illustrate that multiple ETL procedures may be performed on a database from a single database storage unit. The transformation portion of the ETL procedure performs different conversions to the database for placement in the data warehouse 140.",
        "The data marts 150a, 150b, . . . 150n are databases within database storage units that are created to serve a particular group requiring an individualized database. The ETL procedures 145a, 145b, . . . , 145n create and maintain of the data marts 150a, 150b, . . . 150n by extracting the necessary data from the data warehouse 140, transforming the data to meet the particular group requirements, and storing the data in databases of the data marts 150a, 150b, . . . 150n retained in database storage units.",
        "The ETL supervisor 155 has a communication connection 160 to control the ETL procedures 125a, 125b, 125c, . . . , 125n. The ETL supervisor 155 provides the necessary control to insure that they are executed periodically, as scheduled, to extract, transform, and load the data from the data storage units 115a, 115b, . . . , 115n to the data warehouse 140. The ETL procedures 145a, 145b, . . . , 145n also have the communication connection 160 to insure that the ETL procedures 145a, 145b, . . . , 145n are executed as scheduled to create and maintain the data within the data marts 150a, 150b, . . . 150n. The ETL supervisor 155 creates a control log that details the status of the progression and any error codes and error messages generated during the characteristics and scheduling of the ETL procedures 125a, 125b, 125c, . . . , 125n, 145a, 145b, 145c, . . . , and 145n. The ETL supervisor 155 monitors the error codes and the error messages and for error codes having a sufficient severity level to require attention of administrative personnel, the ETL supervisor 155 transmits the error messages to the administrative personnel. The error messages are communicated by a telecommunications device such as a pager or by an electronic mail message.",
        "The ETL supervisor 155 further has a communication link 165 to the database storage units 135, 140, 150a, 150b, . . . , and 150n to monitor the progression of the ETL procedures 125a, 125b, 125c, . . . , 125n, 145a, 145b, 145c, . . . , and 145n. The monitoring logs the characteristics and scheduling of the ETL procedures 125a, 125b, 125c, . . . , 125n, 145a, 145b, 145c, . . . , and 145n.",
        "The ETL supervisor 155 further has an additional communication link 170 to the database storage units 135, 140, 150a, 150b, . . . , and 150n to control the cleansing of the database storage units 135, 140, 150a, 150b, . . . , and 150n. The ETL supervisor 155 interrogates the ETL procedures 125a, 125b, 125c, . . . , 125n, 145a, 145b, 145c, . . . , and 145n to determine the scheduling of any cleaning process required. The ETL supervisor 155 then schedules the required cleansing and institutes the cleansing by way of the communication link 170 that communicates the cleansing instructions to the database storage units 135, 140, 150a, 150b, . . . , and 150n. The control supervisor 155 logs the details of the cleansing schedule for each of the ETL procedures 125a, 125b, 125c, . . . ,125n, 145a, 145b, 145c, . . . , and 145n.",
        "FIG. 3 illustrates the structure of the ETL supervisor 255 of the database system of this invention. The application 210 generates data, which is entered into the database retained in the database storage unit 215. When the data within the database storage unit 215 is to be extracted for placement in the target database such as a data warehouse, the database reproduction procedure is executed to write the data extracted from the database storage unit 225 to the ODS staging unit 235. The ODS staging unit 235 receives the data from the database storage unit 215 with no changes and allows the modification of the data with no changes to the original database.",
        "The ETL control library procedure 260 provides the necessary procedures to monitor the scheduling of the ETL procedures 225b. At the scheduled time, the ETL control library procedure 260 initiates the implementation of the ETL procedure 225b to perform the extraction and transformation of the data stored in the ODS staging unit 235. The ETL procedure 225b extracts the data from the ODS staging unit 235 and modifies the data according to the requirements of the transformation.",
        "This extraction and transformation causes data to be read from and written to the ODS staging unit 235. Upon completion of the transformation of the data, the ETL procedure 225b writes the data to the target database retained by the target database storage unit 240.",
        "The ETL control library procedure 260 creates the ETL program record database 270 by writing the procedure records for the ETL procedure 225b. The ETL procedure records details the characteristics and scheduling of the ETL procedure 225b. The ETL control library procedure 260 reads the program record database 270 for determining the scheduling of the ETL procedure 225b.",
        "Refer now to FIG. 4 for a description of the structure of the program record database 270. Each record of the ETL program record database 270 has a program name field 300, which provides a descriptive label of each of the ETL procedures 225a and 225b to be executed. The program subject record field 305 describes the subject or group of programs to which the ETL procedure is related 225b. The program sequence record field 310 describes the order in which an ETL procedures 225b of a group are to be executed. The order of the ETL procedures 225b generally, but not necessarily, of the same subject or group of related programs. The last-update-time record 315 indicates the last recording date and time that data migrated successfully from the database storage unit 215 to the ODS staging unit 235. The update time 320 is the date and time at which the database within the ODS staging unit is successfully transformed by the ETL procedure 225b. The trigger table field 325 is the source table within the ODS staging unit 235 that is the pointer or cursor for the ETL procedure 225b. The record key field 330 is the primary key field of the trigger table. The record key field 330 is used as the reference in trouble shooting activity to correct functioning of the ETL procedure 225b. The frequency field 335 describes the rate of recurrence for the ETL procedure 225b.",
        "The ETL control library procedure 260 provides a pointer to the ETL procedure 225b to transfer the control records detailing the status of the ETL procedure 225b to the ETL control log database 265. The program name field 340 indicates which of the ETL procedures has had an abnormal extraction of the data from the ODS staging unit 235, transformation of the data and loading of the data to the target database 240. The record time field 345 indicates the time when the abnormal transfer of the data occurred. The record key value field 350 specifies the record within the data containing the abnormality of the data. The trigger table 355 describes the table containing the abnormality of the data. . The error code field 360 denotes the standard error code of the database language employed or the error code of the ETL procedure 225b describing the abnormality of the data. The error message field 365 provides a user defined error message providing a description of the cause of the abnormality of the data. The ETL status field 370 provides a severity indication to provide a level of importance of the abnormality of the data. For instance, a failure message may require instantaneous attention, whereas a caution message may require only a highlight for a summary report.",
        "Returning to FIG. 3, the error reporter 285 is a mechanism that queries the ETL control log database 265 to determine the severity of abnormalities recorded in the ETL control log database 265. If the severity is sufficiently large, the error reporter 285 transmits a message 294 to a responsible person that a severe abnormality in the ETL procedure 225b has occurred. Upon receipt of the message 294, the person can then take appropriate action to rectify any of the abnormalities and reconstruct the original data. The message 294 is transmitted by a telecommunication device such as pager or by an electronic message (email).",
        "The ETL cleaning procedure 275 transmits a request through the ETL control procedure 260 to the ETL procedure 225b for a schedule for cleansing the database residing in the ODS staging unit 235. The cleaning procedure 275 eliminates inconsistencies, redundancies, and corruptions from the database. At the scheduled time for the cleansing of the database, the ETL cleansing procedure 275 is activated and the database resident in the ODS staging unit 235 is cleansed. The cleansing procedure 275 creates and maintains an ETL cleansing log 280.",
        "The field structure for the records of the ETL cleansing log 280 is shown in FIG. 6.

The cleansing table field 385 is the database from which the inconsistent, redundant, or corrupt data is to be removed. The update time field 390 is the date and time for the scheduled cleansing for the ETL procedure 225b. The trigger key list field 395 is the key fields of the trigger table used by the ETL procedure 225b. The clean key list field 400 is the fields in the cleansing table used for the purging of the cleansing table.",
        "Periodically, the summary reporter 290 collects the records of the ETL control log database 265, the ETL program record database 270, and the ETL cleansing log database 280. The records are compiled and transferred as a summary report 296 providing a summation of the contents of the activities of the ETL supervisor 255.",
        "The database system, as above described, maybe implemented as program code written in a programming language such as PL/SQL (Procedural Language extension to Structured Query Language) executed on a computing system. The computing system has at least one execution processor that implements the ETL procedures 125a, 125b, 125c, . . . , 125n, 145a, 145b, 145c, . . . , and 145n of FIG. 2 and magnetic or optical storage media such as disks or tapes to retain the databases retained by the database storage units 135, 140, 150a, 150b, . . . , and 150n of FIG. 2 as described. The ETL supervisor 155 of FIG. 2 is also implemented as program code written in a program language such as PL/SQL with the ETL control log database 265, the ETL program record database 270, and the ETL cleansing log database 280 being retained on the magnetic or optical storage medium. Refer now to FIGS. 7-9 for a discussion of the method for the supervision of ETL procedures of this invention as executed on a computing system.",
        "The ETL supervisory process begins by querying (Box 410) the scheduling of the ETL procedure (Box 405). When the time for the execution for the ETL procedure (Box 405) has arrived, the data from the database 420 on which the ETL procedure is to be executed is replicated (Box 415) into an operational data storage (ODS) staging unit. The ETL procedure is executed (Box 425) upon the replicated data within the ODS staging unit. The ETL supervisory process then logs (Box 430) procedure records for the ETL procedure detailing characteristics and scheduling of the ETL procedure. The ETL supervisory process continues with logging control records (Box 435) for the ETL procedure detailing status of the ETL procedure. A scheduling for cleansing the first database is queried (Box 440) from the ETL procedure (Box 405). At a time, when the cleansing is scheduled to be executed, the data present in the ODS staging unit is cleansed (Box 445) to eliminate inconsistencies, redundancies, and corruptions from the first database. Finally the ETL supervisory process logs (Box 450) a cleansing record for the ETL procedure detailing a cleansing schedule for the first database.",
