    "abstract": "In an active matrix display device using an SRAM, the number of transistors configuring the SRAM circuit is large. Therefore, the transistors cannot be embedded in a pixel when a pixel area is small, otherwise an aperture ratio is reduced. In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide a display device without a refreshing operation and thus with small power consumption. According to the invention, a display device including a pixel which comprises a switching element and a nonvolatile memory element is provided. When a still image is displayed by utilizing a ferroelectric element as a nonvolatile memory element and storing a signal, writing is not required per frame. Further, as the ferroelectric element occupies a small area, a memory circuit can be incorporated without decreasing an aperture ratio.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a display device, and more particularly to a display device using a thin film transistor (TFT) formed on a transparent substrate such as glass or plastics, and a driving method of the same. In addition, the invention relates to electronic apparatuses using the display device.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "In recent years, with the advance of the communication technology, mobile phones have been widely used. In future, transmission of moving images and a larger volume of information are expected. On the other hand, through reduction in weight of personal computers, those adapted for mobile communication have been produced. Information terminals called PDA originated in electronic notebooks have also been produced in large quantities and widely used. In addition, with the development of display devices, the majority of portable information devices are equipped with a flat panel display.",
        "Moreover, according to recent techniques, an active matrix display device tends to be used as a display device for the above portable information device and the like. In the active matrix display device, a TFT is arranged in each pixel and a display screen is controlled by the TFT. Compared to a passive matrix display device, such an active matrix display device has advantages in that it achieves high performance and high image quality, and can handle moving images. Therefore, it is expected that the mainstream of liquid crystal display devices will also shift from passive matrix types to active matrix types.",
        "An active matrix display device has been manufactured using a polycrystalline semiconductor such as polysilicon formed at a temperature of 500\u00b0 C. or less at highest, which is rather low as compared to the conventional condition of 1000\u00b0 C. or more. Such an active matrix display device has advantages in that, in addition to a pixel, a driver circuit can be integrally formed around a pixel portion, which makes it possible to realize downsizing and high definition of a display device. Thus, such a display device is expected to be more widely used in future.",
        "A description is given below on the operation of a pixel portion in an active matrix liquid crystal display device. FIG. 2 shows a configuration example of an active matrix liquid crystal display device. One pixel 220 comprises a source signal line 203, a gate signal line 205, a capacitor line 219, a pixel TFT 207, a storage capacitor 211, and a liquid crystal 215. However, the capacitor line may not necessarily be provided if other wiring and the like can concurrently serve as the capacitor line. A gate electrode of the pixel TFT 207 is connected to the gate signal line 205. Further, either of a drain region or a source region of the pixel TFT 207 is connected to the source signal line 203 whereas the other is connected to the storage capacitor 211 and the liquid crystal 215.",
        "The gate signal line 205 and a gate signal line 206 are selected sequentially in accordance with a line cycle. Provided that the pixel TFT 207 and a pixel TFT 209 are N-channel types, the gate signal line 205 becomes active when it is Hi, thus the pixel TFTs 207 and 209 are turned ON. As the pixel TFTs 207 and 209 are turned ON, potentials of the source signal line 203 and a source signal line 204 are respectively written into the storage capacitor 211 and a storage capacitor 213 and into the liquid crystal 215 and a liquid crystal 217. In the next line period, the adjacent gate signal line 206 becomes active and potentials of pixel TFTs 208 and 210 become Hi. Then, the potentials of the source signal lines 203 and 204 are respectively written into storage capacitors 212 and 214 and into liquid crystals 216 and 218 in a similar fashion. The liquid crystals 215 to 218 are aligned in accordance with the written potentials and change light transmissivity. In this manner, the active matrix liquid crystal display performs a display operation using a liquid crystal as a light shutter.",
        "Also, as shown in FIG. 14, an active matrix display device which performs a display operation with a static RAM (SRAM) inside its pixel portion and is also developed. (See Patent Document 1).",
        "[Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei8-286170",
        "In FIG. 14, one pixel 1407 comprises an SRAM 1403, switches 1405 and 1406, and a liquid crystal 1404. A source signal line driver circuit 1401 outputs an video signal to source signal lines 1408 and 1409. When a gate signal line 1410 is selected by a gate signal line driver circuit 1402, the video signal is written into the SRAM 1403 via the source signal lines 1408 and 1409. Either of the switches 1405 and 1406 operates based on the stored signal in the SRAM 1403 and either a potential Va or Vb is applied to the liquid crystal 1404. This signal is maintained until the next video signal is written into the SRAM 1403. In this manner, a display operation is performed.",
        "Conventional active matrix display devices suffer from problems in that its display portion has a dynamic RAM (DRAM) structure with a storage capacitor and a switching circuit as described above, thus a periodical refreshing operation is required. Operation waveforms thereof are shown in FIG. 3. A pixel signal line waveform approaches a source signal line waveform at the point when the source signal line waveform changes at t1 and t4.",
        "In the conventional example shown in FIG. 3, a display operation can be performed favorably since the rewriting is performed at t2 to t3 and t5 to t6. However, when a refreshing operation is not performed or a refreshing period is long, a charge accumulated in the storage capacitor is discharged due to a leakage current of a switching TFT and thus a voltage required for driving the liquid crystal can not be stored. Therefore, even in the case of displaying an image such as a still image where an image data does not essentially change, periodical writing is required. As a result, power consumption is increased.",
        "Meanwhile, as for an active matrix display device using an SRAM as shown in FIG. 14, the number of transistors configuring the SRAM circuit is large. Therefore, the transistors cannot be embedded in pixels when a pixel area is small, or otherwise an aperture ratio is reduced.",
        "To solve the foregoing problems, the following method is applied to the display device of the invention. That is, a nonvolatile memory element such as one utilizing a ferroelectric material is provided in a pixel portion so that stored data is saved in the nonvolatile memory element without refreshing. By utilizing the ferroelectric material, an SRAM can be omitted, thus an element area occupying each pixel area can be reduced.",

        "Start pulses are inputted to gates of TFTs 803 and 806. When the TFT 806 is turned ON, a gate potential of a TFT 804 becomes Lo, thereby turning OFF the TFT 804. Meanwhile, as a gate potential of a TFT 810 becomes Lo, the TFT 810 is also turned OFF. A gate potential of the TFT 803 is raised to the level of the power source potential. Therefore, a gate potential of a TFT 809 is firstly raised to (the power source potential\u2212|Vgs|). Since an initial potential of an output 1 is Lo, the TFT 809 is to raise its source potential while charging the output 1 and a capacitor 808. When the gate potential of the TFT 809 reaches (the power source potential\u2212|Vgs|), the TFT 809 is still ON, thus the potential of the output 1 further keeps on increasing. As the gate of the TFT 809 has no electric discharge path, the gate potential of the TFT 809 keeps on increasing along with its source potential even past the power source potential.",
        "When the drain and source potentials of the TFT 809 become equal to each other, current flow to the output stops, thus the rise in potential of the TFT 809 is terminated. In this manner, a Hi potential which is equal to the power source potential can be outputted from the output 1. At this time, a potential of CLb is Hi. When the potential of CLb is changed to Lo, a charge accumulated in the capacitor 808 is discharged through the TFT 809 to CLb, thus the potential of the output 1 becomes Lo. A pulse of the output 1 is transferred to the shift register of the subsequent stage. Described above is the operation of the circuit of Embodiment 5.

Note that, a 3-bit gradation is taken as an example in this embodiment, however, the invention is not exclusively limited to 3-bit. As shown in FIG. 9, the nonvolatile memory elements 910 to 912 occupies small areas. Therefore, a memory circuit can be incorporated without decreasing an aperture ratio.",
        "Meanwhile, by setting an area ratio of the pixel electrodes 916, 917, and 918 at 1:2:4, a 3-bit area gradation can be realized. Similarly, in the case of an n-bit area gradation, by providing n pieces of sub-pixels and setting an area ratio of each sub-pixel at one to two raised to the (n\u22121)th power, the gradations can be also realized.",

Also, although a substrate made from a synthetic resin having flexibility, such as plastic, generally tends to have a lower heat resistance temperature as compared to the substrates described above, it is possible to utilize the synthetic resin substrate as the substrate 1000 as long as they are capable of withstanding the process temperatures in the manufacturing steps.",
        "Base films 1001 and 1002 formed of insulating films such as silicon oxide films, silicon nitride films, or silicon oxynitride films are formed over the substrate 1000. For example, the silicon oxynitride film 1001 formed of SiH4, NH3, and N2O is formed to have a thickness of 10 to 200 nm (desirably, 50 to 100 nm) by a plasma CVD method, and the hydrogenated silicon oxynitride film 1002 formed of SiH4 and N2O is similarly laminated thereon to have a thickness of 50 to 200 nm (desirably, 100 to 150 nm). In this embodiment, bilayer base films are shown, however, the base films are not limited to the bilayer structure, and may be a single layer or a multilayer structure of more than two layers formed of the above-mentioned insulating film. In addition, the base films may not necessarily be provided when using a quartz substrate and the like since its impurity diffusion does not become a big problem.",
        "Island-shaped semiconductor layers 1003 to 1005 are each formed of crystalline semiconductor films manufactured by processing a semiconductor film having an amorphous structure with a laser crystallization method or a known thermal crystallization method (see FIG. 10B). The film thickness of the island-shaped semiconductor layers 1003 to 1005 is to be 25 to 100 nm (desirably, 30 to 60 nm). Note that, the island-shaped semiconductor layers 1003 to 1005 may be amorphous semiconductors or polycrystalline semiconductors. Also, not only silicon but also silicon germanium may be utilized for the semiconductor films. In the case of utilizing the silicon germanium, a concentration of the germanium is desirably within a range from 0.01 to 4.5 atomic %.",
        "For manufacturing the crystalline semiconductor film by using a laser crystallization method, laser such as a pulse oscillation type or continuous emission type excimer laser, a YAG laser, or a YVO4 laser is adopted. A method of condensing laser light emitted from a laser oscillator into a linear shape by an optical system and then irradiating the light to the semiconductor film may be employed when these types of lasers are used. The crystallization conditions may be selected by an operator appropriately. However, the pulse oscillation frequency is set at 30 Hz, and the laser energy density is set at 100 to 400 mJ/cm2 (typically between 200 and 300 mJ/cm2) when using the excimer laser. Further, in the case of using the YAG laser, its second harmonic may be utilized to set the pulse oscillation frequency at 1 to 10 kHz, and the laser energy density may be set at 300 to 600 mJ/cm2 (typically between 350 and 500 mJ/cm2). A laser light, which has been condensed into a linear shape with a width of 100 to 1000 \u03bcm, for example 400 \u03bcm here, is irradiated over the whole surface of the substrate. This is performed with an overlap ratio of 80 to 98%.",
        "Next, a gate insulating film 1006 is formed so as to cover the island-shaped semiconductor layers 1003 to 1005. The gate insulating film 1006 is formed of an insulating film containing silicon in thickness of 40 to 150 nm by a plasma CVD method or a sputtering method. In this embodiment, the gate insulating film 1006 is formed of a silicon oxynitride film with a thickness of 120 nm. It is needless to mention that the gate insulating film 1006 is not limited to such a silicon oxynitride film and other insulating film containing silicon may be employed in a single layer or a multilayer structure. For example, in the case of using a silicon oxide film, the silicon oxide film is formed by mixing TEOS (Tetraethyl Ortho silicate) and O2 with the plasma CVD method, setting a reactive pressure and a substrate temperature at 40 Pa and 300 to 400\u00b0 C. respectively, and discharging the mixture of TEOS with O2 at a high frequency (13.56 MHz) and a power flux density of 0.5 to 0.8 W/cm2. The silicon oxide film manufactured in this manner is thereafter subjected to thermal annealing at 400 to 500\u00b0 C., thus favorable characteristics as a gate insulating film can be obtained.",
        "Gate electrodes 1100 to 1102 are formed on the gate insulating film 1006 as shown in FIG. 11A. The gate electrodes 1100 to 1102 may be formed of Tantalum (Ta), Titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), an alloy containing the above metal element as its main component, polycrystalline silicon, and the like. The gate electrodes 1100 to 1102 are formed by forming a conductive layer on the surface of the gate insulating film 1006, and then etching the conductive layer with a resist mask (not shown in the figure).",

        "Next, a resist mask (not shown) is formed so as to cover the gate electrode 1102, an N-type impurity element is added in a self-aligned manner using the gate electrode 1101 and the resist mask as masks, and a P-type impurity element is added in a self-aligned manner using the gate electrode 1101 as a mask.",
        "In this manner, high concentration N-type impurity regions 1111 to 1114 which function as a source region or a drain region of an N-channel TFT, and high concentration P-type impurity regions 1109 and 1110 which function as a drain region of a P-channel TFT are formed. As the impurity element for imparting N-type conductivity, phosphorous (P) or arsenic (As) is used, and as the impurity element for imparting P-type conductivity, Boron (B) is used.",
        "Subsequently, activation of the N type and P type impurity elements is carried out by any following method of furnace annealing, laser annealing, lamp annealing or a combination of these. As for the thermal annealing method, it is performed in a nitrogen atmosphere where an oxygen concentration is 1 ppm or less or, desirably, 0.1 ppm or less at 400 to 700\u00b0 C.",
        "Further, as shown in FIG. 11C, a first interlayer insulating film 1115 formed of a silicon nitride film or a silicon oxynitride film is formed over the gate electrodes 1100 to 1102.",
        "Thus, a switching TFT for configuring a pixel portion and a TFT for configuring a driver circuit and other logic circuits are formed on the same substrate. Next, a capacitor is formed on the first interlayer insulating film 1115 by utilizing a ferroelectric material.",
        "First, a lower electrode layer 1201 is formed (see FIG. 12A). For the formation of the lower electrode layer 1201, a CVD method, a sputtering method, an ion beam sputtering method, a laser ablation method, and the like may be adopted. As for a material used for the lower electrode layer 1201, Pt/IrO2, Pt/Ta/SiO2 and the like may be utilized. As electrical characteristics of a ferroelectric thin film largely depends on an alignment of a crystal, it is particularly desirable that Pt which can easily control the alignment is utilized for the surface of the lower electrode. After forming the metalic film, unnecessary portions are processed by plasma etching in order to form the lower electrode layer 1201.",
        "Next, a ferroelectric layer 1202 is formed over the lower electric layer 1201 (see FIG. 12B). As the ferroelectric, lead-containing perovskite such as PZT and PbTiO3, a bismuth layer compound such as Bi4Ti3O12, an ilmenite-based compound such as LiNbO3 and LiTaO3 may be utilized. Above all, the ferroelectriric using the lead-containing perovskite, PZT is favorably utilized since it shows ferroelectric characteristics over a wide range of composition.",
        "For the formation of the ferroelectric layer 1202, a CVD method, a sputtering method, an ion beam sputtering method, a laser ablation method, and the like may be adopted. Above all, the CVD method is favorably used since it has high controllability of film composition and crystallinity, and thus achieves a large-sized screen and mass production. In the case of using the CVD method, the following conditions are required for the material: having a high vapor pressure relatively at a low temperature; a long-term stability; a precipitating rate which is decided by the amount of raw material supply within a range of a deposition temperature, wherein a nucleating reaction in the vapor phase is not caused. In light of the above points, PZT is still appropriate for the material.",
        "The formation of the ferroelectric layer by the CVD method may be followed by known steps. For example, a ferroelectric layer using PZT can be formed at a pressure of 660 Pa and a substrate temperature of 500 to 650\u00b0 C.",
        "Next, an upper electrode layer 1203 is formed on the ferroelectric layer 1202 (see FIG. 12C). For the formation thereof, a CVD method, a sputtering method, an ion beam sputtering method, a laser ablation method, and the like may be adopted as the lower electrode layer 1201. As a material used for the layer, Ir/IrO2 and the like may be utilized in addition to the material used for the lower electrode layer 1201.",
        "As shown in FIG. 13A, a second interlayer insulating film 1307 using a silicon nitride film or a silicon oxynitride film is formed. Then, contact holes are formed and wirings 1300 to 1306 are formed through the contact holes. A mode of electrical connections between the wirings 1300 to 1306 and TFTs are not exclusively limited to this embodiment.",
        "At the end, a protective layer 1308 is formed over the second interlayer insulating film 1307 as shown in FIG. 13B. As a material for the protective layer 1308, a photo-curing or thermo-curing organic resin material such as a polyimide resin or an acrylic resin can be used.",
        "Through the above-mentioned steps, a TFT for configuring a pixel portion, a TFT for configuring a driver circuit and other logic circuits, and a capacitor using a ferroelectric material for configuring a nonvolatile latch circuit can be concurrently formed on the same substrate.",
        "It is to be noted that, in this embodiment, a structure having an LDD region which does not overlap with a gate electrode is adopted to the switching TFT for configuring the pixel portion, and a single drain structure is adopted to the TFT for configuring the driver circuit and the logic circuits. However, this embodiment is not exclusively limited to these structures. Any TFT structure which is suitably applied to a GOLD structure or other LDD structures and the like may be manufactured according to known steps as needed.",
