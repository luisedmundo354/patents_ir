A first thiophene derivative (2,3-Di-thiophen-2-yl-thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine), which was previously investigated as a nonlinear optical material, is here disclosed for its use as an EC material, and for its incorporation into an EC device. Synthesis of two new thiophene derivatives (2,5-di(thien-2-yl)-3,4-di(2,2,2-trifluoro-ethoxy)-thiophene and 2,5-(2,3-dihydro-thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)-3,4-di(2,2,2-trifluoro-ethoxy)-thiophene), and a new pyrazine derivative (2,3-dibenzyl-5,7-di(thien-2-yl)thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine) are also disclosed, since these materials are all able to selectively change to a green color state, and can be polymerized to achieve a green EC polymer.",

        "Electrochromic (EC) materials are a subset of the family of chromogenic materials, which includes photochromic materials, and thermochromic materials. These materials change their tinting level or opacity when exposed to light (photochromic), heat (thermochromic), or an electric potential (electrochromic). Chromogenic materials have attracted widespread interest in applications relating to the transmission of light.",
        "An early application for chromogenic materials was in sunglasses or prescription eyeglasses that darken when exposed to the sun. Such photochromic materials were first developed by researchers at Coming Incorporated in the late 1960s. Since that time, it has been recognized that chromogenic materials could potentially be used to produce window glass that can vary the amount of light transmitted, although the use of such materials is clearly not limited to that prospective application. Indeed, EC technology is already employed in the displays of digital watches.",
        "Several different distinct types of EC materials are known. Three primary types are: inorganic thin films, organic polymer films, and organic solutions. For many applications, the use of a liquid material is inconvenient, and as a result, inorganic thin films and organic polymer films appear to have more industrial applications.",
        "For inorganic thin film-based EC devices, the EC layer is typically tungsten oxide (WO3). U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,598,293; 6,005,705; and 6,136,161 describe an inorganic thin film EC device based on a tungsten oxide EC layer. Other inorganic EC materials, such as molybdenum oxide, are also known. While many inorganic materials have been used as EC materials, difficulties in processing and a slow response time associated with many inorganic EC materials have created the need for different types of EC materials.",
        "Conjugated, redox-active polymers represent one different type of EC material. These polymers (cathodic or anodic polymers) are inherently electrochromic and can be switched electrochemically (or chemically) between different color states. A family of redox-active copolymers are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,883,220. Another family of nitrogen based heterocyclic organic EC materials is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,923. Research into still other types of organic film EC materials continues, in hopes of identifying or developing EC materials that will be useful in EC windows. There still exists room for improvement and development of new types of EC organic polymer films, and methods of making EC organic polymer films. For example, it would be desirable to develop EC organic polymer films and methods for making the same that provide certain desirable properties, such as specific colors, long-term stability, rapid redox switching, and large changes in opacity with changes of state.",
        "Because red, green, and blue are three primary colors employed for additive color mixing, it would be highly desirable to achieve red, green, and blue EC materials. While red and blue EC polymers have been developed, green EC materials have remained elusive. The disclosure provided herein describes two different ways to obtain green EC polymers, and specific compounds and synthesis techniques that can be used to generate green EC materials.",
        "There are two basic reasons why a material will exhibit a green color. The first reason is based on the principle of complementary colors. Three pairs of complementary colors are red/green, blue/orange, and yellow/purple. If a material absorbs red light (with a wavelength of approximately 620 nm to 780 nm) from white light, the material exhibits a green color. The disclosure provided herein encompasses several different materials exhibiting a single absorption peak between 620 nm and 780 nm (i.e., materials which are green because their single absorption band absorbs red light, the complementary color for green). A second reason why a material will exhibit a green color is if the material includes two different absorption bands, a first absorption band that absorbs light with a wavelength less than about 480 nm (i.e., violet and blue light), and a second absorption band that absorbs all light with a wavelength above about 530 nm (i.e., yellow, orange, and red light). Only green light will be left after this subtraction, and such materials will exhibit a green color. The disclosure provided herein encompasses several different materials exhibiting dual absorption peaks, which filter out all colors but green.",
        "A first green EC material disclosed in detail herein is a thiophene derivative, 2,3-Di-thiophen-2-yl-thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine, originally investigated for potential use as a non-linear optical material.

FIG. 1A graphically illustrates a typical absorption spectrum of green material exhibiting a single absorption peak, while FIG. 1B graphically illustrates a typical absorption spectrum of green material exhibiting dual absorption peaks.",
        "A First Green EC Material Exhibiting a Single Absorption Peak",
        "A first green material exhibiting a single absorption peak which can be used as a green EC polymer is a thiophene derivative, 2,3-Di-thiophen-2-yl-thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine, which originally was evaluated for use as a nonlinear optical material. FIG. 2 illustrates the chemical structure of a thiophene derivative 10 in both a neutral state and in a charged state. In the neutral state, thiophene derivative 10 exhibits a very slight yellow color. Thiophene derivative 10 can be reduced to a radical ion, which has an absorption peak at about 680 nm and exhibits a very saturated green color. The transition from the radical ion (dark green) to the neutral state (pale yellow) is reversible, indicating that thiophene derivative 10 can be used as a green EC material.",
        "FIG. 3 schematically illustrates the synthesis of the thiophene derivative of FIG. 2. This synthesis route was developed while conducting research regarding the potential of the thiophene derivative for use as a nonlinear optical material. Significantly, this research did not involve investigating the use of thiophene derivative 10 as an EC material. As indicated in FIG. 3, thiophene is treated with NBS to yield 2,5-dibromothiophene, which is then treated with a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids. The resulting 2,5-Dibromo-3,4-dinitro-thiophene is treated with tin and HCl to yield 3,4-diamino-thiophene. The diamino-thiophene is combined with 1,2-Di-thiophen-2-yl-ethane-1,2-dione in the presence of heat to yield 2,3-Di-thiophen-2-yl-thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine.",
        "Empirical EC Devices Incorporating 2,3-Di-thiophen-2-yl-thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine",
        "A first empirical electrochromic device was fabricated and includes two indium tin oxide (ITO) glass slides (functioning as transparent electrodes), a silver foil reference electrode, thiophene derivative 10, an electrolyte (tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate), and a non-aqueous solvent (either acetonitrile or propylene carbonate). The completed device is readily switched between a saturated green state and a generally transparent light yellow state by a power source ranging from about \u22122 volts to about 0 volts. This empirical study verified that thiophene derivative 10 can be used to fabricate an EC device in which a color change of the device is from substantially transparent to a saturated green. This device is shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B. Note that thiophene derivative 10 is dissolved in a liquid electrolyte.",
        "A second empirical EC device was constructed to further study thiophene derivative 10 as a green EC material. The second empirical EC device did not incorporate a reference electrode. Instead, a charge balancing molecule, 5,10-dihydro-5,10,dimethylphenazine, was added to reduce the operation potential of the second empirical EC device. The second empirical EC device was switched between states by a potential difference as low as 1.2 volts. The switching speed between states was as fast as 0.4 seconds. Fabrication of the second empirical EC device was simple, because the reference electrode of the first empirical EC device was eliminated. Preliminary results showed that the second empirical EC device has a long cycle life, easy operation, and provides a vibrant color. The second empirical device is schematically illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 5B. FIG. 5C graphically illustrates transmittance data for the EC polymer device of FIGS. 5A and 5B in the oxidized and reduced states.",
        "Note that, as indicated above, a charge balancing molecule is incorporated into the electrolyte layer of the second empirical EC device to reduce the switching potential. FIG. 6 schematically illustrates the structure of the charge balancing molecule, and its redox mechanism, which facilitates charge balancing.",
        "Design Considerations for One Band Green EC Materials",
        "In order to achieve a conducting polymer that absorbs red light (preferably exhibiting a maximum absorption around 750 nm), the conducting polymer must have a band gap at about 1 electron volt or lower. Such conducting polymers include low band gap polymers (also known as \u201csmall band gap,\u201d or \u201cnarrow band gap\u201d polymers). Several strategies can be implemented to synthesize low band gap polymers, including alternating the length of the conjugated structure, and introducing electron donating and withdrawing groups into the structure. A plurality of green EC materials have been developed using the above identified synthesis strategies. Several materials were identified, which exhibited a green color in one state, and a different substantially nontransparent color in a second state. Such materials are less desirable than EC materials that exhibit a green color in a first state and a substantially transparent color in a second state. Other materials were synthesized as monomers, but proved difficult to polymerize. Several materials did exhibit the desired color transition (i.e., from a generally transparent state to a green state), and were successfully polymerized.",
        "FIGS. 7A-7F schematically illustrate the structure of materials investigated to identify candidates for a single band green EC polymer. Compound 1, whose structure is provided in FIG. 7A, was successfully polymerized, and exhibited a color change from red to green (although the non-green color state is red and not substantially transparent, an EC polymer switching between red and green color state will be potentially useful, because some displays function by switching pixels between red, blue, and green states). Empirical testing indicates that the monomer is stable, and the colors exhibited by the polymer are aesthetically acceptable.",

Two related electropolymerization techniques can be employed to polymerize EC monomers in order to achieve a high quality EC polymer film. Density is required to achieve the high contrast between the bleached and unbleached states. High quality is required for repeatability over many cycles. EC polymer films that do not exhibit high contrast and repeatability over many cycles are not very useful as components in EC polymer-based devices, such as windows and displays.",

Oxidative electrochemical polymerization of the monomer is initiated using chronoamperometry to deposit a very thin, very uniform layer of EC polymer onto an ITO coated glass substrate using a platinum wire as a counter electrode. Once again, the selected monomer is placed into a solvent/salt solution, such as a propylene carbonate solution with tetrobutylammonium perchlorate salt.",

A first layer is implemented by ITO transparent electrode 12, followed by an insulating layer 14 (which can be implemented using a non-conductive and transparent polymer such as a parafilm). A reference electrode 18 (preferably implemented using a silver electrode) is sandwiched between upper and lower insulating layers 14. A layer of a green EC polymer 11 is sandwiched between lower insulating layer 14 and a lower transparent electrode 12. Note that each insulating layer includes an opening 20, which is filled with an electrolyte 16. The openings enable electrical charges to be exchanged between the transparent electrodes, the reference electrode, the electrolyte, and the green EC polymer.",
        "A plurality of different electrolytes can be employed. An important component of an EC device is the electrolyte, which must be ionically conductive, but electronically insulating. The use of a semi-solid (or gel) electrolyte is preferred. Such gel electrolytes generally are formed by combining an alkali metal salt (a source of ions) with a polymer host (for stability). For a gel electrolyte to be suitable for smart windows or smart displays, it is important that the gel electrolyte provide high ionic conductivity, high light transmittance (i.e., be optically clear), and be stable over a wide range of time and temperatures. High ionic conductivity is essential in an EC device, because the ions need to freely and quickly migrate within the polymer matrix. Electric conductivity should be negligible, so that the device does not short circuit. For smart window applications, a high light transmittance is also important to maximize the transparency of the window in the bleached state. Stability is equally vital in an EC device. There should be a minimal change in conductivity and transmittance for gel electrolytes measured over time and at various temperatures. These parameters can vary, depending on the salt and solvent combinations used.",
        "In general, gel electrolytes offer superior conductivity compared to entirely solid polymer electrolytes. While liquid electrolytes can be employed, gel electrolytes offer the advantages of mechanical stability (thus facilitating leak-free devices), low weight, and established lifetimes of at least 50,000 cycles, as empirically determined. In a gel electrolyte, the solid polymer matrix of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) provide dimensional stability to the electrolyte, while the high permittivity of the solvents enables extensive dissociation of the lithium salts. The low viscosity of the solvents provides an ionic environment that facilitates high ionic mobility. A variety of different combinations of salts and solvents have been studied to determine optimum combinations.",
        "Highly conductive gel electrolytes have been synthesized from a salt dissolved in an electrolyte solution with the polymer matrix, with PMMA added for dimensional stability. Lithium (Li) is commonly used in EC switching devices due to its small size and because it facilitates the reduction and oxidization of EC polymers. Another salt, tetrabutyl ammonium phosphate (TBAP), can also be employed. Overall, the salt must have a high degree of dissociation and the anion must have a high level of charge delocalization so that the ion-pairing is minimized.",
        "An exemplary, but not limiting list of possible salts includes lithium perchlorate (LiClO4), tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate (TBAP), and trifluorosulfonimide (LiN(CF3SO2)2. An exemplary, but not limiting list of solvents includes propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene carbonate (EtC), acetonitrile (ACN), and \u03b3-butyrolactone (GBL). Preferably, solvents are substantially dried over molecular sieves before use. In general, gel electrolytes are synthesized by first dissolving the salt in the solvent, and then adding the PMMA. A highly conductive (2 mS/cm), viscous and transparent (88%) gel electrolyte can generally be achieved.",
        "Still another useful gel electrolyte can be prepared from 3% LiClO4, 7% PMMA, 20% PC, and 70% acetonitrile (ACN) (% by weight). A simple synthesis of such a gel is achieved by first dissolving the PMMA and LiClO4 in ACN. The PC was dried over 4 angstrom molecular sieves and then combined with the other ingredients. The complete mixture was stirred for 10-14 hours at room temperature. A high conductivity (2 mS/cm), high viscosity and transparent gel electrolyte was formed. As described above, the solid polymer matrix of PMMA provides dimensional stability to the electrolyte, while the high permittivity of the solvents PC and ACN enable extensive dissociation of the lithium salt. The low viscosity of PC provides an ionic environment that facilitates high ionic mobility.",
        "While gel electrolytes are preferred because they facilitate the production of a solid state device (the solvent liquid is contained within the polymer matrix), liquid electrolytes can be used in an EC device. One such liquid electrolyte can be achieved using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) in ACN. It is contemplated that materials other than PVC and PMMA can be employed to provide a polymer matrix for a gel electrolyte, and that materials other than TBAP and LiClO4 can be employed as ionic sources. It should be noted that in the context of the present invention, the terms \u201cgel electrolyte\u201d and \u201csolid electrolyte\u201d are use synonymously, because the liquid materials employed in fabricating a gel electrolyte are absorbed in a polymer matrix, and there are substantially no free liquids that are not contained within the polymer matrix.",
        "A second exemplary EC device including a green EC polymer is schematically illustrated in a transparent state 50a in FIG. 16A, and in a colored state 50b in FIG. 16B. From a structural standpoint, there is no difference in the EC device when in its transparent state or its colored state. The second exemplary EC device, as collectively illustrated in FIGS. 16A and 16B, includes a green EC polymer layer and a counter-electrode layer. Again, the top layer is transparent electrode 42, again, preferably ITO. The next layer is the green EC polymer, which in FIG. 16A is shown as a non-green layer 44a (this could be transparent, as with Compound 13, or red, as with Compound 1), and in FIG. 16B is shown as a colored layer 44b (in the reduced state the green EC polymers discussed above exhibit a saturated green color). Next to the EC polymer layer is a solid/gel electrolyte layer 46. The solid electrolyte layer is followed by a counter-electrode layer 52. No bottom transparent electrode layer is required or included.",
        "Counter-electrode layer 52 is preferably gold-based, platinum-based, or highly conductive carbon-based, or vanadium pentoxide-based. A preferred highly conductive carbon is graphite. It should be understood that while graphite certainly represents a preferred highly conductive carbon, other highly conductive carbon materials can instead be beneficially employed as a conductive film applied as a coating on a transparent substrate to produce a counter-electrode. Many types of conductive carbons are available from a variety of manufacturers, such as Tokai Carbon Co. of Tokyo, Japan; and Loresco International, of Hattiesburg, Miss. Thus, the use of the term \u201cgraphite\u201d herein should be considered to be exemplary, rather than limiting on the scope of the present invention. It is further contemplated that nickel can be beneficially employed as a conductive film on a transparent substrate, to produce a counter-electrode. The use of a counter-electrode can improve the speed of the color change between states, as well as improve the contrast ratio between the two states. The counter-electrode material should be chemically stable, provide high electrical conductivity, and should be easy to fashion into a patterned substrate. Gold, highly conductive carbons, and platinum have been identified as being electrically conductive materials that can be beneficially employed for making a counter-electrode. It is contemplated that graphite will be very useful because of its low cost. Gold, while much more expensive, can be used in very thin layers, thereby minimizing the cost of a gold-based counter-electrode. Platinum, while electrically conductive, is likely to be so expensive as to preclude its use. It is further contemplated that still other conductive materials can be employed to produce the counter-electrode.",
        "Although the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred form of practicing it and modifications thereto, those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that many other modifications can be made to the present invention within the scope of the claims that follow. Accordingly, it is not intended that the scope of the invention in any way be limited by the above description, but instead be determined entirely by reference to the claims that follow."
