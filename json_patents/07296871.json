        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The invention relates to integrated circuits, and, in one embodiment, particularly to analyses of inkjet print head heater chips.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Inkjet printing devices such as inkjet printers, all-in-one devices, multifunction devices, and the like, typically uses a print controller or a printer host to control and to communicate with an inkjet print head. A thermal inkjet print head generally has a heater chip. The heater chip typically includes logic circuitry, a plurality of power transistors, and a set of heaters or resistors, among other things. A hardware or software printer driver will selectively address or energize the logic circuitry such that appropriate resistors are heated for printing. In some heater chip designs, the heater chip includes memory used to store information about the print head. Data stored in the memory is used to identify the print head to determine if the print head is a monochrome print head, a color print head or a photograph quality print head. Data stored in the memory is used to keep track of ink usage.",
        "To monitor and to characterize the functionality of the heater chip, a variety of analytical or monitoring methods, and electrical and material analyses are used to analyze the materials layered in the heater chip and the semiconductor devices of the heater chip. For example, an electrical method is performed by electrically measuring structures that help monitor critical process parameters on every wafer. The electrically measured results of die process monitor (\u201cDPM\u201d) structures on the wafer are compared against a predetermined specification. Examples of electrically characterized parameters include sheet resistance, effective line width, and the like. While an electrical method provides a fast indication of process variation and problems, the electrical method does not generally provide a complete characterization. For example, an electrical monitoring method can generally indicate problems, but rarely can determine a root cause of the problem.",
        "On the other hand, material methods are performed using different metrologies in terms of dimension, composition, topology, and the like. For example, material methods such as sectional analysis or cross-section analysis are used to characterize a print head chip. Using sectional analysis, heater chip characteristics such as devices or film features, information on critical dimension, composition profiles, topology as well as material interaction can be collected. Once the information has been collected, other analyses such as process control and failure analysis can use the information to assist in manufacturing processes. For the printhead heater chip, the heater chip analysis becomes even more important since heater chip characteristics such as the film stack thickness needs to be precisely controlled in order to achieve required thermal performance.",
        "Section analysis is performed by grinding and polishing a thin film stack at a location of interest at the heater chip, followed by optical and e-beam inspection. Section analysis is usually very tedious and time consuming. For example, many sectional cuts are necessary to complete a thorough analysis and inspection.",
        "Accordingly, there is a need for improved heater chip structure to allow for efficient sectional analysis. In one form, the invention provides an integrated circuit that includes, among other things, a plurality of devices having a plurality of device characteristics. The plurality of devices are arranged such that a sectional cut through the integrated circuit reveals the plurality of characteristics of the plurality of devices and structures. In another form, the invention provides an integrated circuit including means for characterizing the integrated circuit wherein a sectional cut through the integrated circuit reveals means for characterizing the integrated circuit.",
        "In yet another form, the invention provides a method of structuring devices in an integrated circuit that has a plurality of locations. The method includes the acts of arranging a plurality of devices of the integrated circuit in close proximity in one of the locations. The method also includes revealing completely the plurality of devices with a section cut on the integrated circuit at the one of the locations.",
        "In yet another form, the invention provides an integrated circuit that has a plurality of locations. The integrated circuit includes a plurality of devices that are arranged in one of the locations. The plurality of devices span an area of no greater than 0.5\u00d710\u22126m2. Arranging the devices in one location allows a sectional cut to completely reveal a plurality of characteristics of the plurality of devices.",
        "In yet another form, the invention provides an integrated circuit having a die area and a plurality of locations. The integrated circuit includes a plurality of devices that are arranged in one of the locations. The plurality of devices span an area of no greater than 1 percent of the die area. Arranging the devices in one location allows one sectional cut to completely reveal a plurality of characteristics of the plurality of devices.",
        "In yet another form, the invention provides a print head comprising a plurality of devices. The print head has a plurality of locations. One of the locations is configured to allow a sectional cut that completely reveals a plurality of characteristics of the plurality of devices and structures.",

        "FIG. 1 illustrates an inkjet print head 10 according to one embodiment of the invention. The print head 10 includes a housing 12 that defines a nosepiece 13 and an ink reservoir 14 containing ink or a foam insert saturated with ink. The housing 12 can be constructed of a variety of materials including, without limitation, one or a combination of polymers, metals, ceramics, composites, and the like. The inkjet print head 10 illustrated in FIG. 1 has been inverted to illustrate a nozzle portion 15 of the print head 10. The nozzle portion 15 is located at least partially on a bottom surface 26 of the nosepiece 13 for transferring ink from the ink reservoir 14 onto a print medium (not shown). The nozzle portion 15 can include a heater chip 16 (not visible in FIG. 1) and a nozzle plate 20 having a plurality of nozzles 22 that define a nozzle arrangement and from which ink drops are ejected onto printing media that is advanced through a printer (not shown).

In some embodiments, the film stack can include a heater layer, a passivation film, and a cavitation film. In addition, the integrated circuit or the heater chip 16 can have other characteristics that can also be revealed with a small number of sectional cuts made through the circuit or the chip 16. By making a sectional cut through the location, desired characteristics of the integrated circuit or the heater chip 16 can be completely revealed.

The Tantalum-with-SOG-step-down measurement provides a SOG step coverage over an active region. Other measurements are heater length with Tantalum and without SOG, and heater width with Tantalum and without SOG, which provide a length and a width of the heater. Similarly, measurements such as heater length without Tantalum and with SOG, and heater width without Tantalum and with SOG which also provide a length and a width of the heater.

Field effect transistor (\u201cFET\u201d) drain contacts and source contacts provide power transistor contact size. FET polycrystalline Silicon line width and first metal layer line width measure a transistor polycrystalline Silicon width and a first metal layer width, respectively. FET P-substrate contact measurement checks a p-substrate contact size of a transistor. FET LDD space measurement checks a transistor LDD space.
