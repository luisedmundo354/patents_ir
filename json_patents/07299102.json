        "This invention is related to manufacturing execution systems and in particular to the control and tracking of engineering changes made to a product while units of the product are in the manufacturing process. An engineering change is a change to the specification of a product that results in a change in the manufactured product units.",
        "In the present invention, a product is manufactured in a manufacturing process controlled and tracked using a manufacturing execution system or MES. An engineering change is made to the product specification while units of the product are in the manufacturing process. The product unit is reworked to match the changed specification. The engineering change implementation function of the manufacturing execution system identifies the products units to be reworked, provides instructions for the rework, and tracks that all affected product units are reworked to the changed specification.",
        "Once a product is designed and manufactured, it may under go modifications that are implemented in subsequent units that are manufactured. Changes are made to make the product safer, lower cost, add functions, etc. to meet changes in the market. These changes are called Engineering Changes because the change usually requires a change in the design specification by engineering. A change to the product usually changes the manufacturing process that produces the product. To assure that changes to designed functions of the product are reflected in the manufactured product, most organizations use an engineering change control process that requires that the manufacturing process changes are in effect before the changed product is manufactured. Each manufactured product may be tracked by a designation of the engineering change to which the product was manufactured. The item identifier, called a part number may be changed or a secondary identifier called a revision or engineering change level may be changed to signify that the product has been changed from the previous design of the product. Many processes and systems have been developed to assure that the manufacturing process changes are made to reflect the engineering change before the product is manufactured.",
        "Many of these changes are unanticipated and there may be units of the product in the manufacturing process when an engineering change is contemplated or implemented. The product units may be allowed to complete the manufacturing process and shipped at the original design. However, it may be economically feasible to modify (rework) units in the manufacturing process so that these units meet the changed requirements. The prior art describes for some products, especially semiconductor products, where the product design, with in limits, can accommodate engineering changes without major reprocessing of the product.",
        "However, the implementation of the engineering change to product units in the manufacturing process have been controlled and tracked manually. With a manual process, there are \u201cescapes\u201d where product units that should have been reworked are not, product units that were thought to have been reworked are not, and product units that should not be reworked are reworked. With a manual process, the wrong rework processes may used to rework product units. The rework process may be dependent on the state of unit in the manufacturing process. A unit that has just started may require just a change in a component in the bin used to assemble the product. A unit later in the process may require a component to be removed and another assembled in its place. A unit near completion, for example after encapsulation, may not be reworked. A unit may continue in the original manufacturing process to a specified point, then reworked to the engineering change specification. After a unit is reworked, the unit may require a different manufacturing process than before rework. For example, a test to validate the rework is executed.",
        "The part identifier of a unit is associated with the engineering specification to which it was manufactured. The part identifier is usually called a part number and may also include a secondary identifier called Engineering Change level (E/C level) or revision level. When a unit built to a first engineering specification is reworked to a second engineering specification, the part identifier for the unit is changed to that associated with the second engineering specification.",
        "The MES uses work order to associate a part identifier and quantity with units to be manufactured. The MES also associates a route, a step-by-step sequence of manufacturing process steps, to a work order as the operational description of the manufacturing process. The MES uses the route to control and track the units in the manufacturing process.",
        "When an engineering change is contemplated and designed, product units may continue to be manufactured. These units may not be useable or may require more rework than if stopped when the engineering change was contemplated. Stopping the manufacturing process will provide the opportunity to assess the quantity of product in the manufacturing process and the state of the units in the process. An economic decision can be made as to if and when the engineering change can be implemented. It may be desirable to permit units to proceed to a specified point in the manufacturing process before stopping.",
        "The product is controlled and tracked in the manufacturing process using a manufacturing execution system, MES, or shopfloor system. The present invention is a function of an MES to assure accurate implementation of an engineering change by:\n\n    \n    \n        1) Identifying the product units for implementation of the engineering change\n        2) Stopping the product in the manufacturing process while allowing other products to continue manufacturing. The stopping point in the manufacturing process can be specified\n        3) Proving a view of the units in the process so that an assessment of the impact engineering change can be made. The state of each unit or group of units can be determined so that rework instruction can be developed dependent on the state of the unit to be reworked.\n        4) Providing the rework instructions or process to implement the engineering change to each unit. The rework instructions may be a function of the state of manufacturing process of the unit. The rework can be applied at a specified point in the manufacturing process.\n        5) Tracking when a unit is reworked. Assure that all units to be reworked are reworked\n        6) Providing the manufacturing process for the unit after rework.\n        7) With each unit reworked, in the associated work orders, decrementing the number of units with the original product identifier and incrementing the number of units with the engineering change product identifier.",

        "A manufacturing execution system (MES) uses a route, a step-by-step sequence that defines a manufacturing process. A step in the route defines a manufacturing process step and the work center at which the step is executed. The step provides operator instructions, parameters or programs for process equipment used at the work center, etc. to execute the process step. At the completion of a process step, the MES provides direction to perform the next process step. The next process step may include an instruction to move the unit to the next work center in the route. A unit is identified by a barcode or other machine-readable identifier or by other means such as a paper traveler with identifying information. Reading the unit's barcode or entering the identifying information selects the unit in the MES. The MES tracks units by the step in the route at which the unit is selected and can determine if the unit is executing the process steps in the proper sequence. The MES can notify if a unit is not following the sequence. The completion of a step can also be tracked. Most MES provide a real time view of the \u201cWork in process\u201d or WIP by product or by work order for a product. A route can be diagrammed as a directed graph where a node represents a step in the route and the arrow designates the next node and step in the route. FIG. 1 illustrates a three-step route that provides Start, Step 2, and End steps.",
        "The Engineering Change Implementation function of the MES provides:\n\n    \n    \n        1) A product stop capability where a specified product in the manufacturing processes can be stopped. When the unit is selected, the MES displays a message to the operator not to process the unit. The stopping point can be specified as a step in the route.\n        2) A view of the route with the quantity of the product at each process step and workcenter. This can be used to determine the work centers at which product is located and the quantity at each work center. FIG. 2 illustrates the quantity at each process step where some process steps may not have units. In FIG. 2, Start has two units, Step 2 has no units, and End has one unit.\n        3) For each work center with units, a means to create rework instructions for the product units and assign a step and second work center in a second route. The second route provides the process for the unit after the rework has been completed. FIG. 3 illustrates a second route with four process steps: Start\u2032, Step 2\u2032, Step 3\u2032, and End\u2032. FIG. 4 illustrates the first route, rework instructions (Rework 1 Instruction and Rework 2 Instruction) for each process step in the first route that has units, and steps in the second route to receive the units when the rework has been completed. In FIG. 4, the units at Start in the first route are reworked using Rework 1 instructions and when complete transferred to Step 2\u2032 in the second route. These units are then directed to the process steps at Step 3\u2032 and End\u2032. The unit at End in the first route is reworked using Rework 2 instructions and when complete transferred to Step 3\u2032 in the second route. The unit is then directed to the End\u2032 process step.\n        4) A unit may not be reworked at the work center at which it was when the Engineering Change was started. It may be desirable for a unit to continue using the first route to a specified step where the rework is performed. FIG. 5 illustrates the first route, rework instructions, Rework 3 Instructions, at the End process step, and the second route. A unit at the Start process step in the first route continues on the first route through the Step 2 process step and to the End process step. At the End process step, the unit is reworked using Rework 3 Instructions and when complete transferred to Step 3\u2032 in the second route. The unit is then directed to the End\u2032 process step.\n        5) An Engineering Change start capability such that when a product unit is selected, the work center operator is provided the rework instructions for the product at that work center and when the rework has been completed, the product unit is transferred to the second route at the second process step. A work order associates a product identifier quantity, and route. The units are initially associated with a first work order with a first quantity. The reworked units are associated with a second work order with an initial quantity of zero (since no units are reworked initially). When a unit is reworked the quantity of units associated with the first work order is reduced by one and the quantity of units associated with the second work order is increased by one. If all units in the first work order are reworked, the quantity in the first work order is zero and the quantity in the second work order is the first quantity.",

In the example, when the unit with Barcode 1 is selected, the MES program selects the row from the Product Unit Route Position Table with Unit Identifier Barcode 1.
