    "abstract": "The invention relates to a pallet truck comprising a lifting device, which is mounted on the axle of two wheels, and having a supporting frame, which is mounted on two rollers, provided with two bearers and is displaceably connected to the lifting device. The lifting device has a lifting pump mounted on a console which is placed on a support that is, in turn, mounted on the axle extending between both wheels. A rod is mounted on the lifting pump, and the lifting pump has a piston rod whose head projects upwardly out of the housing of the lifting pump. A roller is mounted at the rear end of each bearer, and the bearers are connected to one another at the front end via a crossbar. A holding frame having a socket is provided on the front end of the bearers and is mounted in an articulated manner on the head of the piston rod. A two-armed linkage is mounted on both sides of the console. The front arms of this linkage are connected to the console and the rear rod of the linkage is connected to the allocated roller each of which being connected in a manner that permits them to pivot. According to the invention, the pallet truck can be disassembled into two equally heavy parts, and the disassembled parts can be reassembled to form the pallet truck.",

        "The invention relates to a pallet truck having a lifting device mounted on the axle of two wheels, and a supporting frame mounted on two rollers, having two bearers, which is movably connected with the lifting device, whereby the lifting device has a lifting pump arranged on a console, which is arranged on a support that is mounted on the axle between the two wheels, and whereby a rod is arranged on the lifting pump and the lifting pump has a piston rod, the head of which projects out of the housing of the lifting pump, in an upward direction, and whereby a roller is arranged at the back end of the two bearers, in each instance, and the bearers are connected with one another at the front end by way of a crossbar, and a holder frame having a socket is provided at the front end of the bearers, which socket is mounted on the head of the piston rod, in articulated manner, and whereby a two-armed linkage is arranged on both sides of the console, the front arms of which are connected with the console, and the back rod of which is connected with the related roller, in each instance, so as to pivot.",
        "In the case of such a manual pallet truck consisting of a lifting device and a supporting frame, the lifting device and the carrier frame are connected with one another in movable and inseparable manner. As a result, the manual pallet truck is heavy in weight and difficult to handle. It can be carried or lifted only by at least two persons. In this connection, the two persons are also exposed to significant risks of accident. This means that the manual pallet truck cannot be carried up a stair step or down a stair step by only one person, so that the pallet located on the manual pallet truck cannot be brought to the desired location with the manual pallet truck if there are height differences that must be overcome. In the case of a manual pallet truck as an industrial truck, such movements are generally not required. In special cases, however, this results in significant difficulties, because the pallet truck is stable and therefore heavy in weight. For an industrial truck, the amount of the weight is without significance, to a great extent, because it is only driven on a single plane, in other words not on planes of different levels.",
        "The invention is based on the task of configuring a pallet truck in such a manner that it can be easily carried by one person if height differences are to be overcome.",
        "This task is accomplished in that the head of the piston rod and the socket is secured against falling out by means of an easily releasable screw, and that the front arm of the linkage, in each instance, is arranged so as to rotate on the console, by means of a socket pin, and that the socket pin is secured against falling out by means of a holder pin.",
        "In this manner, one arrives at a pallet truck of the type stated initially, which fully fulfills the aforementioned task. The screw guided by the socket can be released without using tools, because a wing nut is screwed onto the free end of the screw. The two socket pins on the console can also be easily released without using tools. As a result, there is the possibility of very quickly separating the lifting device and the supporting frame, with three manipulations, so that there are two parts, namely the lifting device, on the one hand, and the supporting frame, on the other hand. The lifting device alone can be easily carried from one plane to another plane, by way of a stair step, as can the supporting frame.",
        "The two parts, namely the lifting device and the supporting frame, can be connected with one another again by means of three simple manipulations, after they have been brought to a different location.",
        "Furthermore, the advantage of being able to divide the manual pallet truck into two parts consists in the fact that the manual pallet truck, when it is broken down into its two parts, can easily be lifted into a station wagon, passenger car, small truck or large truck, by only a single person, and stowed away there.",
        "Assembly or disassembly of the pallet truck takes place without tools, and no individual parts have to be stored, which could possibly be lost. Assembly as well as disassembly are performed by a single person, during a short time of only a few seconds.",
        "In a further embodiment of the invention, it is provided that the lifting device is configured as a thrust piston pump, the piston rod of which is mounted to be axially displaceable in the pump housing, and projects out of the pump housing in an upward direction. In this way, the supporting frame can be lifted and lowered with the required lift.",
        "It is advantageous if the screw in the socket is passed through the side walls of the socket and a ring-shaped constriction in the top part of the piston rod.",
        "It is practical if the socket pin is mounted in the console so as to rotate, and the holder pin is guided through the console and a ring-shaped constriction of the socket pin.",
        "Furthermore, it is recommended that the screw and the holder pin as well as the socket pin are connected with one another by means of a chain.",
        "It is practical if the pallet truck is configured in such a manner that a set of wheels having two wheels and an axle is provided, whereby a support is mounted to rotate on the axle, which support carries the console with the pump device.",
        "A rod for lifting, lowering, pulling, pushing and steering the pallet truck can be provided on the console, which rod activates the pump device by being pivoted in the vertical plane.",
        "To reduce the weight of the pallet truck, the bearers, the holder frame of the supporting frame, as well as the rod have openings or recesses.",
        "The task underlying the invention is also accomplished in that the pallet truck can be broken down into two parts of approximately equal weight, and that the disassembled parts can be re-assembled to form the pallet truck.",
        "It is practical if the solution to the task consists of being able to break the pallet truck down into the lifting device and the supporting frame, and that the lifting device and the supporting frame can be re-assembled to form the pallet truck.",
        "In this way, the pallet truck can easily be broken down into the lifting device and the supporting frame, if necessary, so that subsequently, the lifting device can be brought to a different location by a single person, and the supporting frame can also be brought to the same different location by the same person, where the lifting device and the supporting frame can be easily re-assembled to form the pallet truck.",
        "The two parts, namely the lifting device and the supporting frame, can be very quickly connected with one another again, after they have been brought to a different location.",
        "In a further embodiment of the invention, it is provided that the lifting pump is configured as a thrust piston pump, the piston rod of which is mounted to be axially displaceable in the pump housing, and projects out of the housing in an upward direction. In this way, the supporting frame can be lifted and lowered with the required lift.",
        "It is practical if the pallet truck is configured in such a manner that a spring-loaded snapper is provided in the holder frame, at the level of the piston rod head, which acts perpendicular to the piston rod axis, i.e. horizontally, which snapper is brought into and out of engagement with a constriction of the piston rod head.",
        "It is recommended to provide a horizontally directed accommodation journal on the console, on both sides, in each instance.",
        "The pallet truck can also be configured in such a manner that a toggle lever is mounted, in articulated manner, on the bearers, in each instance, each toggle lever having a bearing accommodation, open towards the front, to accommodate the accommodation journal, at its front end.",
        "In addition, a holder bracket can be arranged so as to pivot, in the front region of the toggle lever, which bracket is to be pivoted over the bearing accommodation.",
        "It is practical if the pallet truck is configured in such a manner that a set of wheels having two wheels and an axle is provided, whereby a support is mounted to rotate on the axle, which support carries the console with the pump device.",
        "A rod for lifting, lowering, pulling, pushing and steering the pallet truck can be provided on the console, which rod activates the pump device by being pivoted in the vertical plane.",
        "To reduce the weight of the pallet truck, the bearers, the holder frame of the supporting frame, as well as the rod have openings or recesses.",
        "The one part of the pallet truck consists of the handle, the steering rod with the pump, the piston rod, and two wheels, while the other part of the pallet truck consists of the supporting frame, the toggle lever, two pulling rods, and two or four rollers.",

Subsequently, the two closed brackets 168 and 169 are opened, so that the accommodation pins 164 and 165 are freed and the toggle lever 157 can be removed from the accommodation pins 164 and 165. With this, the lifting device 102 and the holder frame 101 of the pallet truck are separated from one another and can also be transported independent of one another, and carried by a single person.",
        "If the separation of the pallet truck into the lifting device 102 and the holder frame 101 is supposed to be made retroactive again, the lifting device 102 is tilted towards the holder frame 101 so far that the pin head 137 can enter into the socket of the bearing bar 127. Subsequently, the lifting device 102 is set perpendicular again, so that the bearing opening 166 of the toggle lever 157 accommodates the accommodation pins 164 and 165. Afterwards, the two brackets 168 and 169, which were open until then, are closed again, so that in this way, the original state of the pallet truck is restored, namely the lifting device 102 and the holder frame 101 are rigidly connected with one another, in articulated manner.",
