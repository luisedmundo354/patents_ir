        "The present disclosure relates generally to information handling systems, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for reinforcing an information handling system chassis.",
        "As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option is an information handling system. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements may vary between different applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.",
        "Some information handling systems are housed in a chassis and may be mounted in racks for storage and/or use. As computing needs continue to grow, the information handling system components housed in the chassis increase in weight, size, and number, which leads to issues with respect to the chassis.",
        "As additional and heavier components are housed in the chassis, the component support surface may begin to sag or bow from the weight of the components, causing the component support surface to deflect from a planar orientation to a bowed orientation. It is desirable to minimize the amount of space taken up by a chassis in the rack in order to mount as many information handling systems in the rack as possible, and the deflection of the component support surface to the bowed orientation may cause the chassis to deflect into space in the rack that is meant to be used by other chassis. Furthermore, the deflection of the component support surface to the bowed orientation creates a perception of low quality due to the systems sagging or bowed appearance.",
        "Typically, the deflection of the component support surface to the bowed orientation is dealt with by stiffening the component support surface by fabricating a thicker component support surface. This is undesirable due to the need to minimize the space taken up in the rack by the chassis and the additional costs incurred in fabricating the thicker component support surface.",
        "Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a method and apparatus for reinforcing a chassis absent the disadvantages found in the prior methods discussed above.",

In an exemplary embodiment, the chassis cover 400 is fabricated from a convention sheet metal known in the art.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 5a, 5b, and 5c, a method 500 for reinforcing a chassis is illustrated. The method 500 begins at step 502 where a chassis is provided. The component support surface 300 is positioned in the component housing 206 on the chassis section 200 such that the front edge 302a of the component support surface 300 is adjacent the front edge 202a of the chassis reinforcing member 202 and the rear edge 302b on the component support surface 300 is adjacent the rear edge 202b on the chassis reinforcing member 202. Positioning the component support surface 300 in the component housing 206 on the chassis section 200 provides a chassis 502a. In an embodiment, the chassis 502a may be the chassis 116, described above with reference to FIG. 1.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 5a, 5b, and 5c, the method 500 then proceeds to step 504 where the chassis 502a is reinforced. The component support surface 300 is coupled to the chassis reinforcing member 202 using methods known in the art such as, for example, rolling the edge of the coupling apertures 214 on the chassis reinforcing member 202 over the edge of the coupling apertures 308 on the component support surface 300, positioning rivets through the coupling apertures 214 and 308 on the chassis reinforcing member 202 and the component support surface 300, respectively, welding the component support surface 300 to the chassis reinforcing member 202, combinations thereof, or a variety of other methods known in the art. In an embodiment, any apertures in the chassis 502a may be shielded to prevent electromagnetic interference to and from components in the chassis 502a. Furthermore, the side wall mounting section 304b on the component support surface 300 is coupled to the side wall 204a on the chassis section 200. By coupling the component support surface 300 to the chassis section 200, the chassis reinforcing member 202 is held in a substantially planar orientation by the component support surface 300, as illustrated in FIGS. 5a and 5b. As a result of holding the chassis reinforcing member 202 in a substantially planar orientation, the bend 210 in the chassis reinforcing member 202 is flattened out, which creates a reinforcing force F from the chassis reinforcing member 202 which is directed towards the component housing 206 and creates a stress in the component support surface 300 directed towards the component housing 206, as illustrated in FIGS. 5a and 5b.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 5a, 5b, 5c, and 5d, the method 500 proceeds to step 506 where components are coupled to the chassis 502a. A power supply component 506a is coupled to the chassis 502a by positioning it in the component slot 304a. A motherboard component 506b is coupled to the chassis 502a by positioning it between the component mounting features 306a, 306c and 306d, and a fan component 506c is coupled to the chassis 502a by mounting it to the motherboard component 506b. A disk drive component 506d is coupled to the chassis 502a by positioning it between the component mounting features 306b and 306c, and a plurality of other components 506e and 506f are coupled to the chassis 502a using methods known in the art. In an embodiment, the components 506a, 506b, 506c, 506d, 506e, and 506f may be components of the information handling system 100, described above with reference to FIG. 1. In an embodiment, the bend 210 in chassis reinforcing member 202 is designed such that, with the components 506a, 506b, 506c, 506d, 506e, and 506f coupled to the chassis 502a, the force F provided by the chassis reinforcing member 202 counteracts the weight of the components 506a, 506b, 506c, 506d, 506e, and 506f and the component support surface 300 and the chassis reinforcing member 202 are oriented in a substantially planar orientation, as illustrated in FIG. 5c.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 4, 5a, 5d, and 5e, the method 500 proceeds to step 508 where the chassis cover 400 is coupled to the chassis 502a. The chassis cover 400 is positioned adjacent the chassis 502a such that the front edge 402a on the chassis cover 400 is adjacent the front edge 202a of the chassis reinforcing member 202 and the rear edge 402b of the chassis cover 400 is adjacent the rear edge 202b of the chassis reinforcing member 202. The side walls 404a and 404b on the chassis cover 400 may then be coupled to the side walls 204a and 204b, respectively, on the chassis section 200, as illustrated in FIG. 5e, using methods known in the art.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 5a, 5b, 5d, 5e, and 5f, the method 500 proceeds to step 510 where the chassis 502a is mounted in a rack. A rack 510a including a plurality of spaced apart supports 510aa and 510ab is provided. The chassis 502a may then be mounted in the rack 510a by engaging the sides of the chassis section 200 which are adjacent each of the side walls 204a and 204b with the supports 510aa and 510ab, respectively. With the chassis 502a mounted in the rack 510a, the chassis reinforcing member 202 remains in a substantially planar orientation and substantially parallel to the chassis cover 400, as illustrated in FIG. 5f. The bend 210 in the chassis reinforcing member 202 prevents the chassis 502a from sagging or bowing between the supports 510aa and 510ab due to the weight of the components 506a, 506b, 506c, 506d, 506e, and 506f in the component housing 206, which results in the chassis 502a taking up minimal space in the rack rather than sagging or bowing into a space reserved for another chassis, and provides an appearance of chassis strength and quality due to the chassis 502a holding its structure when mounted between the supports 510aa and 510ab in rack 510a. While the component support surface 300 has been illustrated as a chassis floor, the chassis support surface 300 and chassis reinforcing member 202 may be located in different positions and orientation on the chassis 502a where additional support is needed.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 6, in an alternative embodiment, a chassis section 600 is substantially similar in design and operation to the chassis section 200, described above with reference to FIGS. 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4, 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, and 5f, with the provision of a modified crease 602 and a modified bend 604 replacing the creases 208a and 208b and the bend 210. The crease 602 is centrally located on the chassis reinforcing member 202 and results in the bend 604 in the chassis reinforcing member 202 which is directed away from the plane 212 and towards the component housing 206, as illustrated in FIG. 6. In an embodiment, the crease 602 and bend 604 in the chassis section 600 may be modified to provide different reinforcing forces for different component and weight distributions in the chassis.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 7, in an alternative embodiment, a chassis section 700 is substantially similar in design and operation to the chassis section 200, described above with reference to FIGS. 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4, 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, and 5f, with the provision of a plurality of modified creases 702a, 702b, and 702c and a modified bend 704 replacing the creases 208a and 208b and the bend 210. The creases 702a, 702b, and 702c are located on the chassis reinforcing member 202 in a spaced apart and substantially parallel relationship and result in the bend 704 in the chassis reinforcing member 202 which is directed away from the plane 212 and towards the component housing 206, as illustrated in FIG. 7. In an embodiment, the creases 702a, 702b, and 702c and bend 704 in the chassis section 700 may be modified to provide different reinforcing forces for different component and weight distributions in the chassis.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 8, in an alternative embodiment, a chassis section 800 is substantially similar in design and operation to the chassis section 200, described above with reference to FIGS. 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4, 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, and 5f, with the provision of a modified bend 802 replacing the creases 208a and 208b and the bend 210. The bend 704 creates an arcuate section of the chassis reinforcing member 202 between the side walls 204a and 204b which is directed away from the plane 212 and towards the component housing 206, as illustrated in FIG. 8. In an embodiment, the bend 804 in the chassis section 800 may be modified to provide different reinforcing forces for different component and weight distributions in the chassis.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 9, in an alternative embodiment, a chassis section 900 is substantially similar in design and operation to the chassis section 200, described above with reference to FIGS. 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4, 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, and 5f, with the provision of a plurality of modified creases 902a, 902b, 902c, and 902d and a plurality of modified bends 904a and 904b replacing the creases 208a and 208b and the bend 210. The creases 902a, 902b, 902c, and 902d are located on the chassis reinforcing member 202 in a spaced apart and substantially parallel relationship and result in the plurality of bends 904a and 904b in the chassis reinforcing member 202 which are spaced apart and substantially parallel and are directed away from the plane 212 and towards the component housing 206, as illustrated in FIG. 9. In an embodiment, the creases 902a, 902b, 902c, and 902d and bends 904a and 904b in the chassis section 900 may be modified to provide different reinforcing forces for different component and weight distributions in the chassis.",
