        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a gas barrier film having superior gas barrier performance and a method for producing the same as well as an organic electroluminescence device (henceforth referred to as \u201corganic EL device\u201d) utilizing the gas barrier film. More precisely, the present invention relates to a gas barrier film suitable as a substrate of various kinds of devices and a method for producing the same, as well as a flexible organic EL device utilizing the gas barrier film.",
        "2. Description of the Background",
        "Conventionally, gas barrier films prepared by forming a thin film of metal oxide such as aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide or silicon oxide on a surface of a plastic substrate or film have been widely used in packaging of articles which require shielding of various gases such as water vapor and oxygen, and packaging use for preventing deterioration of food, industrial materials, medical supplies and so forth. In addition to the packaging use, gas barrier films are recently coming to be used also in liquid crystal display devices, solar cells, EL devices and so forth.",
        "In the course of development of image display devices such as liquid crystal display devices and EL devices in recent years, transparent base materials for forming these devices are required to satisfy highly sophisticated requirements in addition to suitability for production of lighter and larger devices, for example, they must have long term reliability and higher degree of freedom of the shape, they must enable display on a curved surface, and so forth. As a transparent base material that satisfies such sophisticated requirements, plastic base materials are beginning to be adopted as new base materials as an alternative to conventional glass substrates, which are heavy, readily broken and difficult to be formed with a larger size. Plastic base materials not only satisfy the aforementioned requirements, but also show more favorable productivity compared with glass substrates because a roll-to-roll system can be used for them, and therefore they are more advantageous also in view of cost reduction.",
        "However, plastic base materials have a drawback that their gas barrier property is inferior to that of glass base materials. If a base material having poor gas barrier property is used, water vapor and air permeate the material to, for example, degrade liquid crystals in a liquid crystal cell, form display defects and thereby degrade display quality. In order to solve this problem, plastic films in which a metal oxide thin film is formed on a plastic film have been developed so far. Examples of such plastic films include those comprising a plastic film on which silicon oxide is vapor-deposited (Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) No. 53-12953), those comprising a plastic film on which aluminum oxide is vapor-deposited (Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication (KOKAI) No. 58-217344) and so forth are known. These films have a water vapor barrier property of about 1 g/m2/day represented in terms of permeability.",
        "The gas barrier performance required for plastic film substrates used for recently developed large-sized liquid crystal displays, high precision displays and so forth is about 0.1 g/m2/day in terms of water vapor barrier property. Furthermore, development of organic EL displays, high precision color liquid crystal displays and so forth has recently progressed, and therefore required are transparent base materials usable for these having further higher barrier performance, in particular, barrier performance of less than 0.1 g/m2/day in terms of water vapor barrier ability, while maintaining transparency. In order to meet such a demand, recently studied is film formation by the sputtering method or CVD method as a means that can be expected to provide higher barrier performance, in which a thin film is formed by using plasma generated by glow discharge under a low pressure condition. Moreover, organic luminescence devices in which a barrier film having an alternate laminate structure of organic layers and inorganic layers is produced by the vacuum deposition method are proposed (e.g., International Patent Application Laid-open Publication in Japanese (KOHYO) No. 2002-532850 (claim 1, FIG. 1)).",
        "However, in these methods for forming a thin film, an organic substance blown as a vapor of a high temperature condenses on a film and form a thin film, and the film is temporarily heated and causes partial deformation. As a result, the subsequent lamination step becomes uneven, and thus the methods have a problem that they cannot provide sufficient barrier ability. Moreover, in these methods for forming a thin film, the number of the lamination step increases, and thus they have a problem of high cost. Furthermore, when a surface of a plastic substrate showing high water absorption is treated, the absorbed moisture is vaporized, thus it requires long time to obtain vacuum, and therefore there is also a problem that the processing cost becomes high.",
        "Further, as for heat resistance of base material films, for disposing TFT in the production of active matrix type image devices in recent years, heat resistance of a still higher level is required. For example, a method of forming a polycrystalline silicon film at a temperature of 300\u00b0 C. or lower by plasma decomposition of a gas containing SiH4 is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication (KOKAI) No. 7-81919 (claim 3, [0016] to [0020]). Moreover, a method of forming a semiconductor layer mixed with amorphous silicon and polycrystalline silicon on a polymer substrate at a temperature of 300\u00b0 C. or lower by irradiation of an energy beam is disclosed in International Patent Application Laid-open Publication in Japanese No. 10-512104 [pages 14 to 22, FIG. 1, FIG. 7). Furthermore, a method of forming a polycrystalline silicon semiconductor layer on a plastic substrate provided with a thermal buffer layer at a temperature of 300\u00b0 C. or lower by irradiation of a pulsed laser beam is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 11-102867 (claims 1 to 10, [0036]).",
        "As described above, various methods of forming a polycrystalline silicon film for TFT at a temperature of 300\u00b0 C. or lower have been proposed, and therefore it is useful that the base materials have heat resistance for a temperature of 250\u00b0 C. or higher. On the other hand, such methods for forming a semiconductor layer as described above use complicated configurations and apparatuses and require high cost, and therefore heat resistance for a temperature of 300\u00b0 C. to 350\u00b0 C. or higher is desired for plastics substrates.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 6,492,026 discloses a heat-resistant substrate having a barrier stack consisting of at least one inorganic layer and at least one polymer layer but it fails to show sufficient heat resistance.",
        "The present invention was accomplished in view of the aforementioned problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a gas barrier film that can exhibit superior gas barrier property when it is used in image display devices such as liquid crystal display devices and organic EL devices and a method for producing such a gas barrier film. Another object of the present invention is to provide an organic EL device utilizing such a gas barrier film.",
        "The inventors of the present invention conducted various researches, and as a result, they found that the object of the present invention could be achieved with the gas barrier film described below. That is, the object of the present invention is achieved by a gas barrier film alternately comprising at least one inorganic layer and at least one organic layer on a resin base material having a glass transition temperature of 250\u00b0 C. or higher.",

In the comparative example, a polyethersulfone (PES) film having a thickness of 100 \u03bcm (Tg: 220\u00b0 C.) and a ZEONOA film having a thickness of 100 \u03bcm (Tg: 160\u00b0 C.) were used as a plastic base material.",
        "1. Preparation of Inorganic Oxide Layer",
        "As shown in FIG. 1, an inorganic layer was prepared by using a roll-to-roll type sputtering apparatus 1. This apparatus 1 had a vacuum chamber 2, and a drum 3 for cooling a plastic film (base material) 6 by contact on the surface was disposed at the center of the chamber. Further, a feeding roller 4 and rolling-up roller 5 for winding the plastic film 6 were disposed in the aforementioned vacuum chamber 2. The plastic film 6 wound around the feeding roller 4 was wound around the drum 3 via a guide roller 7, and further the plastic film 6 was wound around a roller 5 via a guide roller 8. As for a vacuum pumping system, the gas in the vacuum chamber 2 was always evacuated by the vacuum pumps 10 from exhaust ports 9. As for a film formation system, a target (not shown) was placed on a cathode 12 connected to an electric discharge power source 11 of the direct current system, which could apply pulse electric power. This electric discharge power source 11 was connected to a controller 13, and this controller 13 was further connected to a gas flow control unit 14, which supplied reactive gas to the vacuum chamber 2 through a piping 15 while controlling the introduced gas volume. Further, the vacuum chamber 2 was designed so that an electric discharge gas could be supplied to the chamber at a constant flow rate (not shown). Hereafter, specific conditions will be explained.",
        "Si was set as a target, and a DC power source of the pulse applying type was prepared as the electric discharge power source 11. As the plastic film 6, the polyimide film having a thickness of 100 \u03bcm mentioned above was used, and this film was put on the feeding roller 4, and led to the winding roller 5. After the preparation of the base material in the sputtering apparatus 1 was finished, a door of the vacuum chamber 2 was closed, and the vacuum pump was operated to start evacuation and cooling of the drum. When the reached pressure became 4\u00d710\u22124 Pa, and the drum temperature became 5\u00b0 C., running of the plastic film 6 was started. Argon was introduced as the electric discharge gas, and the electric discharge power source 11 was turned on to generate plasma on the Si target at an electric discharge power of 5 kW and a film formation pressure of 0.3 Pa and thereby perform presputtering for 3 minutes. Then, oxygen was introduced as a reactive gas. After the discharge was stabilized, argon and oxygen gas volumes were gradually decreased to lower the film formation pressure to 0.1 Pa. After stability of the discharge at 0.1 Pa was confirmed, formation of a silicon oxide film was performed for a certain period of time. After completion of the film formation, the internal pressure of the vacuum chamber 2 was returned to the atmospheric pressure, and the film on which the silicon oxide film was formed was taken out.",
        "2. Preparation of Sol-gel Layer",
        "In an amount of 8 g of SOARNOL D2908 (ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer produced by Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of 118.8 g of 1-propanol and 73.2 g of water at 80\u00b0 C. In an amount of 10.72 g of this solution was added and mixed with 2.4 ml of 2 M/L (N) hydrochloric acid. This solution was added dropwise with 1 g of tetraethoxysilane with stirring and further stirred for 30 minutes. Then, the obtained coating solution was added with dimethylbenzylamine for pH adjustment and applied to the aforementioned sputtered inorganic oxide film by using a wire bar.",
        "Then, the coated layer was dried at 140\u00b0 C. to form a sol-gel layer having a film thickness of about 1 \u03bcm on the aforementioned inorganic oxide vapor-deposited base material. This was designated Film 1A.",
        "In the same manner as described above except that the drying temperature was changed as shown in Table 1, Films 1B and 1C were prepared.",

        "As shown in Table 1, when the polyimide having Tg of 250\u00b0 C. or higher was used as the resin of the film base material (Films 1A to 1C), the oxygen permeability was lower than 0.15 mL/m2\u00b7day\u00b7atm, and the water vapor permeability was lower than 0.30 g/m2\u00b7day. On the other hand, when the polyethersulfon and ZEONOA having Tg lower than 250\u00b0 C. was used (Films 1D to 1I), the oxygen permeability was higher than 0.20 mL/m2\u00b7day\u00b7atm, and the water vapor permeability became higher than 0.48 g/m2\u00b7day. Further, for the cases using the polyimide having Tg of 250\u00b0 C. or higher, when a drying temperature for the organic layer of 150\u00b0 C. or higher was used (Films 1B and 1C), the oxygen permeability and water vapor permeability were markedly improved compared with those obtained with the drying temperature lower than 150\u00b0 C. (Film 1A). Furthermore, the films having only one of the organic layer and inorganic layer on the film base material (Films 1J and 1K) provided only high oxygen permeability and high water vapor permeability.",
        "From the above, it can be seen that the gas barrier film of the present invention has superior gas barrier performance because it uses a film substrate having Tg of 250\u00b0 C. and a combination of the inorganic layer and organic layer. Further, it can be seen that the gas barrier film of the present invention can have further superior gas barrier performance when the temperature of the drying step for the organic layer prepared by the sol-gel method is 150\u00b0 C, or higher.",

        "Substrate XY and Substrate Z were stacked so that the electrodes should face each other via the light-emitting organic thin film layer between them, heated and pressurized at 160\u00b0 C., 0.3 MPa and 0.05 m/min by using a pair of heat rollers to obtain Organic EL Device 1.",
        "As a comparative organic EL device, Organic EL Device 2 was also prepared by using Film 3E in the production of Substrate X.",

        "DC voltage was applied to the obtained Organic EL Devices 1 and 2 by using Source-Measure Unit Model 2400 (Toyo Corporation) to allow them to emit light. Both of Organic EL Devices 1 and 2 favorably emitted light.",
        "After the production of organic EL Devices 1 and 2, they were left at 25\u00b0 C. and relative humidity of 75% for 1 month, and then similarly allowed to emit light. As a result, Organic EL Device 1 similarly showed favorable light emission, whereas defects increased in Organic EL device 2.",

        "Organic EL Device 3A was prepared in the same manner as in Example 5 except that a heat treatment was performed at 230\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes assuming disposition of TFT after a transparent electrode was formed on Film 3A (Tg of the resin base material: 270\u00b0).",
        "Further, Organic EL Device 3W was prepared in the same manner as that used for Organic EL Device 3A except that an inorganic oxide layer and a sol-gel layer were formed under the same conditions as those used for Film 1F of Example 1 on a film utilizing Polyimide 1 having the following structure (Tg: 285\u00b0 C.).",
        "",
        "Furthermore, Organic EL Device 3D was prepared in the same manner as that used for Organic EL Device 3A except that the base material was changed to Film 3D and the heat treatment was changed to a heat treatment at 300\u00b0 C. for 1 hour.",
        "Moreover, it was attempted to prepare an organic EL device as a comparative organic EL device in the same manner as that used for Organic EL Device 3A except that Film 1F (Tg of the resin base material: 160\u00b0) was used. However, Film 1F markedly deformed after the heat treatment, and thus an organic EL device could not be produced.",
        "2. Test",
        "DC voltage was applied to the obtained Organic EL Devices 3A, 3D and 3W by using Source-Measure Unit Model 2400 (Toyo Corporation) to allow them to emit light. All of the organic EL devices emitted light.",
