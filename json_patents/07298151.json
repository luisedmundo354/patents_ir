        "The present invention is directed to the field of reducing thermal noise in circuits.",
        "One problem associated with sampling circuits, such as switched capacitor circuits, is that each time a signal is sampled, thermal noise is also sampled. Thermal noise arises due to the random motion of free electrons in a conducting medium. Each free electron inside the medium is in motion due to its thermal energy. Since capacitors are noiseless devices, the capacitors of sampling circuits do not have any thermal noise associated with them. However, thermal noise will be present in the switch used for the sample operation or an amplifier used for the sample operation. The sampled thermal noise introduces undesired disturbances into the sampled signal.",
        "The integrated thermal noise power of a sampling circuit is the product of the thermal noise spectral density and the thermal noise bandwidth of the circuit. In the case where a switch is used in connection with a sample and hold operation, the thermal noise spectral density and the thermal noise bandwidth are calculated in part based on the on-resistance of the switch. In the case where an amplifier is used in connection with the sample and hold operation, the thermal noise spectral density and the thermal noise bandwidth are calculated in part based on the transconductance of the amplifier. In conventional sampling circuits, the spectral density and the bandwidth of the thermal noise are dominated by the same element, for example the switch or the amplifier, of the sampling circuit. When the integrated thermal noise power is calculated, the result is kT/C, where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the ambient temperature, and C is the capacitance of the sampling capacitor, because the on-resistance of the switch or the transconductance of the amplifier cancels in the spectral density and bandwidth terms. Although the capacitance of the sampling capacitor selected can be increased to reduce the sampled thermal noise, large capacitance is undesirable because larger capacitors in a sampling circuit consume more power and space.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional sample and hold circuit having an integrated thermal noise power of kT/C. Circuit 2 includes a switch 1 coupled between an input voltage 3 and a capacitor 5 coupled to ground. Switch 1 is switchable between an on state and off state via switch control signal 7. When switch 1 is switched to an on state, which represents a closed position, a charge proportional to input voltage 3 is stored on capacitor 5. When switch 1 is switched to an off state, the charge on the capacitor is frozen. Although capacitor 5 is a noiseless element, switch 1 is not. Hence, when the charge is sampled onto capacitor 5, thermal noise is also sampled. The power of the sampled thermal noise can be expressed as shown below in Equation 1.",

According to this embodiment, the sample and hold circuit of FIG. 3 has been modified to omit the amplifier 49 and instead include two cascaded amplifiers, one having a switch in its feedback loop.

A first capacitor 243 is coupled at one end to the first sample switch 237 and the first hold switch 241, and at the other end to an inverting input 245 of a first amplifier 247. An output of first amplifier 247 is coupled to an inverting input of a second amplifier 255 at a node 253. Non-inverting inputs 257, 259 of first and second amplifiers 247 and 255, respectively, are each coupled to ground. A second sample switch 261 is coupled between inverting input 245 and output 253 of first amplifier 247. A second capacitor 249 and a second hold switch 251 are coupled in series between inverting input 245 of first amplifier 247 and output 263 of second amplifier 255.",

When this occurs, first capacitor 243 is coupled between input voltage 239 and a virtual ground at inverting input 245 of first amplifier 247, and a charge proportional to input voltage 239 is stored on first capacitor 243.

        "In FIG. 10, increasing the gain of amplifier 213 will improve linearity and distortion during the hold mode. However, to keep the same loop bandwidth, the impedance of the bandwidth-limiting element 221 must be increased in proportion to the gain of amplifier 213. This is impractical for high gains because such an impedance would be difficult to physically implement, and a large impedance in the feedback path could cause loop instability. In FIG. 11, two amplifiers 247 and 255 are used. First amplifier 247 limits bandwidth of sampled thermal noise and dominates the thermal noise spectral density. First amplifier 247 is chosen such that the effective impedance that determines the thermal noise spectral density is less than the effective impedance that determines the thermal noise bandwidth. Second amplifier 255 is chosen to have a high gain to improve the linearity and reduce the distortion of the signal at the output 263 of second amplifier 255 during the hold mode. Thus, first amplifier 247 may have a lower gain, while the overall gain may be high, determined by the product of the gain of amplifiers 247 and 255. Equations 24 and 25, which respectively describe the spectral density of the sampled thermal noise and the bandwidth of the sampled thermal noise of FIG. 10 also apply to the configuration of FIG. 11, with the exception that first amplifier 247 determines both the noise spectral density and the effective bandwidth liming impedance, ZBW.",

Thus, during the sample phase, unlike the circuit of FIG. 11, the first amplifier has bandwidth-limiting element 275 in its feedback path. Because the gain of first amplifier 277 does not need to be large for distortion reasons, ZBW of the bandwidth-limiting element does not need to be large. Thus, the first amplifier 277 of FIG. 12 is less likely to cause stability problems than the first amplifier 213 of FIG. 10.",

The circuit 279 of FIG. 13 is substantially the same as circuit 273 of FIG. 12, but shows an implementation of bandwidth-limiting element 275 and first amplifier 277. In particular, bandwidth-limiting element 275 is implemented using a switch 281 controlled by a switch control signal 283 and a resistor 285. First amplifier 277 is implemented using a transconductance amplifier 287 and a resistor 289 coupled between an output of the transconductance stage and ground.",
        "In the configuration of FIG. 13, bandwidth-limiting element 275 will limit the bandwidth of the sampled thermal noise and first amplifier 277 will be the dominant thermal noise source. Assuming the resistance of resistor 285 is much greater than the resistance of resistor 289, the gain of loop 291 may be expressed as follows:\n\nA=gm*RLOAD\u2003\u2003(28)\n\nwhere gm is the transconductance of transconductance amplifier 287 and RLOAD is the resistance of resistor 289. Applying Equation 28 to Equation 25, and substituting the resistance of resistor 285 (i.e., RFB) for ZBW in Equation 25, the noise bandwidth at inverting input 245 may be expressed shown in Equation 29.",

To reduce the noise power contribution of resistor 285 below kT/C, the gain of loop 291 may be set above one. To reduce the noise power contribution of transconductance amplifier 287 below kT/C, the value of RLOAD/RFB may be decreased below \u00be.",

        "It should be appreciated that although embodiments described herein related to sample and hold circuits and, in particular, switched capacitor circuits, the invention is not limited in this respect. Principles of the invention may be applied to capacitor circuits that are not sample and hold circuits, and/or circuits that include energy storage elements other than capacitors. FIG. 16 illustrates an example of a non-sampled, non-capacitor based circuit in which the integrated thermal noise may be reduced below theoretical limits by employing the principles described herein.",
        "Circuit 350 of FIG. 16 is a non-sampling inductive circuit including an inductor 352, a resistor 354, and a bandwidth-limiting element 356, each of which is coupled in parallel. Inductors, like capacitors, are noiseless circuit elements. Thus, inductor 352 does not contribute thermal noise to the system. Likewise, bandwidth-limiting element 356 constructed such that it does not contribute significant thermal noise to the system. Therefore, resistor 354 is the dominant source of thermal noise. Bandwidth-limiting element 356 is constructed so that it limits the bandwidth of the thermal noise. Inductor 352 is a current storage element. Thus, the noise spectral density (in Amps2/Hz), noise bandwidth (in Hz), and total integrated noise current (in Amps2) through the inductive storage element can be expressed as set forth in Equations 34-36, below:",
