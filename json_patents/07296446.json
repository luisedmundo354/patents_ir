        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a lock, and more particularly to a lock assembly can be used to secure an object in a position conveniently in cooperation with a cable.",
        "2. Description of Related Art",
        "Locks are widely used to prevent objects from being stolen and are developed into different types for different purposes. But, locks of securing an object in a position are not fully developed.",
        "When articles are displayed in a business show or in stores, the articles are probably fastened via ropes or steel cables in concern of the articles. However, to fasten an article via ropes or steel cables is troublesome and time consuming. Moreover, unauthorized personnel might still untie the ropes or the steel cables and steal the articles.",
        "To overcome the shortcomings, the present invention provides a lock assembly to obviate or mitigate the aforementioned problems.",
        "The primary objective of the invention is to provide a lock assembly comprising a casing, a securing axle and a wheel. The securing axle is mounted rotatably in the casing and has a threaded end extending out of the casing. The wheel is mounted rotatably in the casing and selectively engages with the securing axle to rotate the securing axle. By rotating the wheel and the securing axle simultaneously, the threaded end of the securing axle can be screwed into an article. When the wheel disengages from the securing axle, the wheel cannot rotate the securing axle to keep the securing axle in the article. Then the article is in a position in cooperation with a cable.",
        "In another objective of the invention, a lock cylinder is provided to control the engagement between the securing axle and the wheel. Users can lock and unlock the lock cylinder by a key to control the engagement between the wheel and the securing axle. Therefore the lock assembly of the present invention may be used conveniently.",

The first end of the active bracket (50) abuts the second end of the active tube (30). The head (52) is formed on the second end of the active bracket and has multiple active teeth (53). The active teeth (53) extend on the outer wall of the active bracket (50) and correspond to and selectively engage the teeth (43) in the wheel (40). The mounting hole (51) is non-circular and is formed axially through the active bracket (50).",
        "With further reference to FIG. 6, the resilient element (60) is mounted in the fourth chamber (14) of the casing (10) and has an end. The end of the resilient element (60) pushes the active bracket (50) to slide along the fourth chamber (14) of the casing (10) and to engage the teeth (43) with the active teeth (53).",
        "The securing axle (70) is mounted rotatably in the fifth chamber (15) of the casing (10) and has a threaded end (72), an active end and a mounting portion (71). The threaded end (72) extends out of the casing (10). The mounting portion (71) is formed on the securing axle (70) near the active end and is non-circular in cross section to be mounted securely in the mounting hole (51) of the active bracket (50) and to allow the securing axle (70) rotating simultaneously with the active bracket (50).",
        "The associated key (80) has a tubular operating portion with an opening end and an inner surface, a protrusion (81) and multiple key cutouts. The protrusion (81) is formed on the inner surface to buckle with the notch (221) of the locking bar (21) to make the key (80) rotating simultaneously with the locking bar (21). The key cutouts are formed along the opening end in different sizes determined by the positions and lengths of the bolts (223) in the lock cylinder (20). The associated key (80) can hold around the actuated end of the locking bar (21) and engages with the bolts (223). Then the bolts (223) are pushed respectively by the key cutouts. Such the bolts (223) and the tumbler pins (232) are pushed to an interface between the stationary cylinder (23), the active cylinder (22), the locking bar (21) and the active rod (211) can rotate relative to the stationary cylinder (23) when the associated key (80) is turned.",
        "With further reference to FIG. 5, since the active bracket (50) is pushed by the resilient element (60), the end of the active bracket (50) opposite to the head (52) can push the active tube (30) to move axially close to the proximal end of the casing (10) in the second chamber (12) of the casing (10). The user can use the associated key (80) to rotate the locking bar (21) and the active rod (211) relative to the stationary cylinder (23). When the active rod (211) rotates and slides along the inclined planes of the notches (31) in the active tube (30), the active tube (30) and the active bracket (50) may move gradually toward the lock cylinder (20) at the same time. Eventually, the active teeth (53) engages with the teeth (43) in the wheel (40). When the active teeth (53) engages with the teeth (43), rotating the wheel (40) simultaneously rotates the active bracket (50) and the securing axle (70).",
        "With further reference to FIG. 7, the operational cable (82) has two ends, one of the ends is fixed with the lock assembly of the present invention, and the other end has a loop (820). When an article (such as a notebook computer) having a corresponding threaded hole needs to be secured in a certain position, the lock assembly passes through the loop (820) of the cable (82) to tie the cable (82) to a stationary facility. Then the key (80) is inserted and turned to engage the active teeth (53) and the teeth (43). Then the wheel (40) is rotated to screw the threaded end (72) of the securing axle (70) into the corresponding threaded hole of the article. After the securing axle (70) is screwed into the article, the key (80) is turned to disengage the active teeth (53) from the teeth (43). Then the securing axle (70) disengages with the wheel (40) and may remain in the article. Therefore, the article can be effectively fastened in a certain position.",
