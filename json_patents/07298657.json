        "This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-252358, filed Aug. 31, 2005, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a ferroelectric random access memory using a ferroelectric capacitor, and in particular, to a ferroelectric random access memory having a remedial redundancy function.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Ferroelectric random access memories (FeRAMs) using a ferroelectric capacitor are known as nonvolatile semiconductor storage devices. Chain FeRAMs (TMs) are also known, as disclosed in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication Nos. 10-255483, 11-177036, and 2000-22010. In the chain FeRAM, a cell transistor and a ferroelectric capacitor are arranged in parallel to constitute one unit cell. Moreover, a plurality of unit cells is connected in series to constitute a memory cell block. The chain FeRAM serves to realize small-sized memory cells, planar transistors that are easy to manufacture, and a general-purpose high-speed random access function.",
        "For the chain FeRAM, it is important to acquire a chip with a large signal amount in order to ensure reliability. To obtain a sufficient signal amount, it is effective to operate the memory using a pulse signal with a somewhat large pulse widely. When a large number of unit cells are connected in series in a memory cell block, a longer time is required to apply a desired potential to the cells. This affects the signal amount, preventing an increase in operating speed.",
        "On the other hand, semiconductor storage devices generally have a remedial redundancy function. With this function, when any of the main cells are defected, the defected cell is replaced with a redundancy cell to improve yield. The chain FeRAM also has a redundancy memory cell block to provide a remedial redundancy function.",
        "However, a redundancy region in which the redundancy memory cell block is formed is normally located at an end of a cell array. The location at the cell array end may degrade the characteristics of the unit cells in the redundancy memory cell block compared to those of main unit cells that have not been replaced. When the unit cells in the redundancy memory cell block have bad characteristics, remedy efficiency may decrease.",
        "Further, even with successful remedy, the use of the redundancy region may degrade the capabilities of the chip. In a conventional chain FeRAM disclosed in, for example, FIG. 40 of Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 10-255483, as many unit cells as those connected in series in a main memory cell block are connected in series in a redundancy memory cell block. One end of the redundancy memory cell block is connected to a bit line via a block selecting transistor. The other end is connected to a spare plate line.",
        "In the chain FeRAM, when data is read from a selected unit cell, the corresponding bit line is set to a low potential, for example, zero. The corresponding plate line is boosted from the low potential to a high potential, for example, 3 V. On the other hand, when data is written to a selected unit cell, then one of the corresponding bit and plate lines is set to a low potential, for example, zero depending on the write data. The other is set to a high potential, for example, 3 V.",
        "When data is read from one of a plurality of unit cells in a redundancy memory cell block which is located furthest from the corresponding bit line, the polarization state of the selected cell is read to the bit line via a large number of cell transistors. This reduces the speed at which signals are read from the selected cell. On the other hand, when data, particularly \u201c1\u201d data, is written to the unit cell located furthest from the bit line, a potential of 3 V applied to the bit line is transmitted to the selected cell via a large number of cell transistors. This reduces the time for which the write potential is applied to a ferroelectric capacitor in the selected cell. The write operation is thus insufficient.",
        "When data is read from the unit cell located furthest from the plate line, a potential of 3 V applied to the plate line is transmitted to the selected cell via a large number of cell transistors. This also reduces the speed at which signals are read from the selected cell. On the other hand, when data is written to the unit cell located furthest from the plate line, writing \u201c0\u201d data involves transmitting a potential of zero applied to the plate line to the selected cell via a large number of cell transistors. This reduces the time for which the write potential is applied to the ferroelectric capacitor in the selected cell. Writing \u201c1\u201d data involves transmitting a potential of 3 V applied to the plate line to the selected cell via a large number of cell transistors. This reduces the time for which the write potential is applied to the ferroelectric capacitor in the selected cell. That is, when data is written to the unit cell located furthest from the plate line, the write operation is insufficient for both \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d data.",

        "According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a ferroelectric random access memory comprising a memory cell block which includes a plurality of unit cells connected in series and each composed of a memory cell transistor having a source and a drain and a ferroelectric storage element connected in parallel between the source and drain of the memory cell transistor, the memory cell block being connected between a bit line and a plate line via a block selecting transistor, and a redundancy memory cell block which includes a plurality of unit cells the number of which is smaller than that of the unit cells in the memory cell block, the unit cells being connected in series and each composed of a redundancy cell transistor having a source and a drain and a ferroelectric storage element connected in parallel between the source and drain of the redundancy cell transistor, the redundancy memory cell block being connected between the bit line and a spare plate line via a spare block selecting transistor, the redundancy memory cell block being used in place of the memory cell block when any of the unit cells in the memory cell block is defected.",

Moreover, the block selecting circuit drives the spare block selecting line SBS1 to a high potential, for example, 3 V, to turn on the block selecting transistor 26 in the redundancy memory cell block 23.",
        "To read data, the spare plate line SPL is subsequently boosted from a low potential to a high potential, for example, from 0 to 3 V, as shown in FIG. 6. To read data, the bit line BL is set to a low potential, for example, zero.",
        "For the other redundancy memory cell block 22, as shown in FIG. 3, the block selecting transistor 25 is turned off, with all the redundancy cell transistors in the four unit cells turned on.",
        "The spare plate line SPL is boosted to 3 V to read the polarization state of the ferroelectric capacitor in the selected cell C7 to the bit line BL via the four transistors consisting of the three cell transistors and the one block selecting transistor 26. In the prior art, the signal potential is read to the bit line BL via eight transistors consisting of seven cell transistors and one block selecting transistor. That is, the present invention reads the signal potential to the bit line BL via fewer transistors than the prior art. Thus, even if the unit cells in the redundancy memory cell blocks have bad characteristics, specifically the redundancy cell transistors in the unit cells have increased on resistance values, the bit line BL potential can rise faster, as shown by a solid line in FIG. 6, than in a conventional case shown by a broken line. In the redundancy memory cell block 23, selection of the unit cell C7 is the worst condition for a data read operation. Thus, when data is read from a unit cell in the redundancy memory cell block 23 which is different from the unit cell C7, the signal potential is read to the bit line BL faster than with the unit cell C7.",
        "Thus, when the data is read from the unit cell C7, located furthest from the bit line BL, the polarization state of the selected cell is read to the bit line BL via fewer transistors than in the prior art. This increases the speed at which signals are read from the selected cell.",

        "FIG. 5 is a circuit diagram illustrating an operation performed to write \u201c1\u201d data to the selected unit cell C7. To write \u201c1\u201d data, the voltage across the spare plate line SPL is reduced from the high voltage to the low voltage as shown in FIG. 6. The voltage across the bit line BL is raised to the high potential.",
        "The voltage across the bit line BL is raised to the high potential and applied to the ferroelectric capacitor in the unit cell C7 via the four transistors consisting of the one block selecting transistor 26 and the three redundancy transistors. In the prior art, the potential across the bit line is applied to the selected cell via eight transistors consisting of one block selecting transistor and seven redundancy cell transistors. That is, the first embodiment applies the potential across the bit line BL to the selected cell via fewer transistors than the prior art. Thus, even if the unit cells in the redundancy memory cell blocks have bad characteristics, specifically the redundancy cell transistors in the unit cells have increased on-resistance values, the potential across the bit line BL is applied to the selected cell fast. Consequently, the potential across the bit line BL rises faster, as shown by a solid line in FIG. 6, than in a conventional case shown by a broken line. This increases the time for which the write voltage is applied to the ferroelectric capacitor in the selected unit cell C7 compared to that in the prior art. As a result, the \u201c1\u201d data can be sufficiently written.",
        "Thus, when \u201c1\u201d data is written to the unit cell C7, located furthest from the bit line BL, the potential across the bit line BL is applied to the unit cell C7 fast. This increases the time for which the write voltage is applied to the ferroelectric capacitor in the selected unit cell C7, resulting in a sufficient write operation.",
