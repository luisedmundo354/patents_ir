    "abstract": "Provided is a bio-sensor system which utilizes radio frequency identification technology and which includes a remote transponder in wireless communication with an implantable passively-powered on-chip transponder. The bio-sensor system is specifically adapted to provide a substantially stable and precise sensor reference voltage to a sensor assembly that is included with the on-chip transponder. The remote transponder is also configured to remotely receive data representative of a physiological parameter of the patient as well as identification data and may enable readout of one or more of the physiological parameters that are measured, processed and transmitted by the on-chip transponder upon request by the remote transponder. The precision and stability of the sensor reference voltage is enhanced by the specific circuit architecture of the glucose sensor to allow for relatively accurate measurement of the physiological parameter such as measurement of glucose concentration by a glucose sensor without the use of a microprocessor.",

        "This is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/849,614 filed May 20, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,125,382.",
        "Not Applicable",
        "The present invention relates to sensor devices and, more particularly, to an bio-sensor system configured for wirelessly transmitting data to a remote transponder from an on-chip transponder having a sensor and which is implantable in a patient. The bio-sensor system is specifically adapted to apply a stable and precise voltage to an electrode system of the sensor such that glucose concentration levels of the patient may be accurately measured.",
        "The blood glucose concentration level of a patient is normally controlled by the pancreas. However, for patients suffering from diabetes, the pancreas does not properly regulate the production of insulin needed to metabolize food into energy for the individual. For diabetic patients, glucose levels must be checked or monitored several times throughout the day so that insulin may be periodically administered in order to maintain the glucose concentration at a normal level. In one popular method, the glucose level is monitored by first obtaining a sample of blood from finger-pricking. The glucose level of the blood sample is then placed on a glucose measurement strip and a subsequent chemical reaction produces a color change that may be compared to a reference chart. In this manner, the reaction of the blood sample with the glucose measurement strip provides an indication as to whether the glucose level is abnormally low or high such that the diabetic patient may administer the proper amount of insulin in order to maintain the glucose concentration within a predetermined range. Such administration of insulin is typically performed by way of self-injection with a syringe.",
        "Unfortunately, the finger-pricking method of glucose testing is uncomfortable as both the blood-pricking and the insulin injections are painful and time-consuming such that many diabetic patients are reluctant to check their glucose levels at regular intervals throughout the day. Unfortunately, glucose levels often fluctuate throughout the day. Therefore, even diabetic patients who are otherwise consistent in checking their glucose levels at regular intervals throughout the day may be unaware of periods wherein their glucose levels are dangerously low or high. Furthermore, the finger-pricking method is dependent on patient skill for accurate testing such that the patient may rely on erroneous data in determining the dosage level of insulin. Finally, self-monitoring of glucose levels imposes a significant burden on less capable individuals such as the young, the elderly and the mentally-challenged.",
        "At the time of this writing, it is estimated that 17 million people in the United States, or about six percent of the population, have diabetes. Due in part to dietary habits and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, particularly among children, diabetes is expected to increase at the rate of about 7 percent every year such that the disease is predicted to eventually reach epidemic proportions. In addition, the current cost of diabetes in the United States alone is estimated at over $120 billion with the total U.S. sales of the glucose measuring strips alone estimated at about $2 billion. Thus, there is a demand for continuous, reliable and low-cost monitoring of glucose levels of diabetic patients due to the increasing number of people diagnosed with diabetes.",
        "Included in the prior art are several implantable devices have been developed in an effort to provide a system for continuous and reliable glucose monitoring. In such implantable devices, an electrochemical sensor is embedded beneath the skin of the patient. The electrochemical sensor detects the glucose concentration level and transmits signals representative of the glucose concentration level to a receiving device. Unfortunately, such implantable devices suffer from several deficiencies. One such deficiency is that implantable devices may expend a substantial amount of power in sensing and processing bio-signals. The power requirement for such devices necessitates the use of large batteries in order to prolong the useful life. Unfortunately, implantable devices having batteries as the power source may require periodic surgeries for replacement of the batteries when the capacity drops below a minimum level.",
        "Furthermore, some batteries contain materials that may present a risk of harm to the patient due to toxic substances or chemical within the battery that may leak into the patient after implantation. Also, due to the relatively limited power capacity of batteries, the range of functions that may be performed by the implantable device may be somewhat limited. Finally, it may be desirable to monitor multiple physiological parameters in addition to glucose concentration levels. In such cases, the implantable device may require multiple sensors wherein each sensor simultaneously monitors a different physiological parameter of the patient. For example, in addition to monitoring glucose concentration levels, the temperature and heart rate of the patient may also be monitored. Such an implantable device having multiple sensors may consume more power than can be supplied by a battery that is miniaturized for use in an implantable device.",
        "One implantable device in the prior art overcomes the above noted deficiency associated with large power requirements by providing a bio-sensor system that is passively powered such that the operating life of the bio-sensor is theoretically unlimited. As understood, the passively powered bio-sensor system includes at least one sensor that is implanted in a patient. The implanted sensor monitors physiological conditions of the patient. An implanted passive transponder receives the sensor signals from the sensor, digitizes the sensor signals and transmits the digitized sensor signal out of the patient's body when subjected to an interrogation signal from a remote interrogator. The interrogator also energizes the implanted transponder such that the bio-sensor system may be passively powered. In this manner, the passively powered bio-sensor system requires no batteries such that it essentially has an unlimited operating life.",
        "Another deficiency of implantable devices pertains to electrochemical sensors that are utilized therein to measure glucose concentration levels in the patient's blood. Such sensors typically use an amperometric detection method wherein oxidation or reduction of a compound is measured at a working electrode in order to determine substance concentration levels. A potentiostat is used to apply a constant potential or excitation voltage to the working electrode with respect to a reference electrode. In measuring glucose concentration levels in the blood, glucose oxidase (GOX) is typically used as a catalyst to oxidize glucose and form gluconic acid, leaving behind two electrons and two protons and reducing the GOX. Oxygen that is dissolved in the patient's blood then reacts with GOX by accepting the two electrons and two protons to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and regenerating oxidized GOX.",
        "The cycle repeats as the regenerated GOX reacts once again with glucose. The consumption of O2 or the formation of H2O2 is subsequently measured at the working electrode which is typically a platinum electrode. As oxidation occurs at the working electrode, reduction also occurs at the reference electrode which is typically a silver/silver chloride electrode. The more oxygen that is consumed, the greater the amount of glucose in the patient's blood. In the same reaction, the rate at which H2O2 is produced is also indicative of the glucose concentration level in the patient's blood. Because the potentiostat controls the voltage difference between the working electrode and the reference electrode, the accuracy with which the sensor measures glucose concentration levels is dependent on the accuracy with which the voltage is applied. If the voltage that is applied to the sensor is excessive, the silver or silver chloride reference electrode may be excessively consumed such that the reference electrode may become damaged. Furthermore, erroneous measurements of glucose concentration levels may result such that the ability of the patient to administer insulin in order to correct for abnormalities in glucose concentration levels may be compromised",
        "In an attempt to overcome the above-described deficiency associated with two-electrode electrochemical sensors, three-electrode electrochemical sensors have been developed wherein an auxiliary electrode is included with the working electrode and the reference electrode. The inclusion of the auxiliary electrode is understood to reduce the consumption of silver and silver chloride by reducing the magnitude of current flowing through the reference electrode, thereby stabilizing the electrode potential. Unfortunately, such three-electrode electrochemical sensors of the type describe above add complexity and cost to the bio-sensor system due to the increased difficulty in manufacturing and operating such electrochemical sensors.",
        "As can be seen, there is a need for an implantable bio-sensor system that overcomes the above-described deficiencies associated with the stability of the reference electrode potential with respect to the working electrode. More specifically, there exists a need in the art for an implantable bio-sensor system that provides a stable and accurate voltage to the electrochemical sensor in order to improve the accuracy with which glucose concentration levels may be measured. In combination with the power requirements, there is also a need in the art for an implantable bio-sensor system that enables the simultaneous and selective monitoring of multiple physiological parameters of the patient through the use of multiple bio-sensors included with the implantable device. Furthermore, there exists a need in the art for an implantable bio-sensor system which allows full-duplex operation such that requests for data (i.e., physiological parameters of the patient) and transmission of such data can be simultaneously performed. Finally, there is a need in the art for an implantable bio-sensor system that enables continuous readout of the data at a remote device.",
        "Provided is a telemetric bio-sensor system which utilizes radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and which includes a remote transponder that is in wireless communication with a passively powered on-chip transponder. The bio-sensor system is specifically adapted to provide a substantially stable and precise voltage to a sensor assembly that is included with an implantable on-chip transponder. The remote transponder is placed within a predetermined distance of the on-chip transponder in order to supply power to and request telemetry data from the on-chip transponder. The remote transponder is also configured to remotely receive data representative of a physiological parameter of the patient as well as identification data and may enable readout of one or more of the physiological parameters that are measured, processed and transmitted by the on-chip transponder upon request by the remote transponder.",
        "Importantly, the power receiver supplies a substantially non-deviating sensor reference voltage to the sensor in order to enhance the accuracy with which the physiological parameter is measured. The precision and stability of the sensor reference voltage (i.e., the sensor power) is enhanced by the specific circuit architecture of the glucose sensor. The application of the substantially stable voltage to the sensor assembly allows for relatively accurate measurement of the physiological parameter of the patient such as measurement of a glucose concentration level by a glucose sensor. The technique of generating the stable and precise voltage may be applied to a 2-pin glucose sensor as well as to a 3-pin glucose sensor without the use of a microprocessor such that cost and power consumption of the on-chip transponder may be reduced. Advantageously, the stability and accuracy of the sensor reference voltage is achieved without the use of a microprocessor to reduce power consumption of the on-chip transponder as well as reduce overall costs of the bio-sensor system.",
        "The on-chip transponder includes the sensor assembly having the sensor which may be the 2-pin or 3-pin glucose sensor. However, any other sensor may be used with the on-chip transponder. Components of the on-chip transponder may include: the sensor, a power receiver, an analog-to-digital (A/D) assembly, a data processor and an RF transmitter which may preferably be interconnected using conventional integrated circuit technology such that the on-chip transponder may be packaged into a sufficiently small size for implantation into a patient. An RF receiver may also be included with the on-chip transponder to allow for selection among a plurality of sensors and to allow for full-duplexing, which enables continuous and/or simultaneous two-way wireless communication between the remote transponder and the on-chip transponder.",
        "The remote transponder emits a scanner signal that is received by a power receiver of the on-chip transponder. The power receiver converts the scanner signal to a power signal to power the A/D assembly, a data processor and an RF transmitter. The A/D assembly converts the physiological parameter contained in an analog electrical signal coming from the sensor into digital format in a digital signal. The A/D assembly may also add a unique identification code to the digital signal to identify the particular sensor from which the sensor signal originated.",
        "The data processor receives the digital signal from the A/D assembly and filters, amplifies and/or encodes the digital signal to generate a processed data signal. The data processor may also gate the data signal to determine when to transmit the data signal and may also sum the data signal with other data (i.e., from other sensors). The RF transmitter impresses (i.e., modulates) the data signal onto a radio carrier of a desired frequency, amplifies the modulated carrier and sends it to an antenna for radiation to the remote transponder.",

The remote transponder 800 may alternatively be fixedly mounted and may be configured to automatically transmit power and telemetry request data to the patient and, hence, the on-chip transponder 100 when the patient moves within the predetermined distance to the remote transponder 800. Regardless of whether it is handheld, fixedly mounted or otherwise supported, the remote transponder 800 is configured to remotely receive data representative of a physiological parameter of the patient as well as identification data such that the data may be stored or displayed.",

The pulse generator is connected in parallel to the SAW delay 830 at the first and second RF amplifiers 820, 840 and cooperates therewith to generate first and second pulse signals 852, 854 for receipt by respective ones of the first and second RF amplifiers 820, 840 such that the second RF amplifier generates 840 a second amplified RF signal 841. The detector-filter 890 is connected to the second RF amplifier and is configured receive the second amplified RF signal 841 for extraction of digitized data therefrom.",
        "As is also shown in FIG. 2, the bio-sensor system 10 may further include a decoder 900 connected to the detector-filter 890 by data output lines 902, 904 and configured to receive the second amplified RF signal 841 for extraction of digitized data therefrom. For configurations of the bio-sensor system 10 having the plurality of sensors 210 wherein each one of the sensor 210 is operative to sense a physiological parameter of the patient and generate the sensor signal 234 in response thereto, the decoder 900 may be configured to select one from among the plurality of sensor signals 234 from which to receive data.",
        "The decoder 900 may be configured to convert the digitized data back to original physiological data. The decoder 900 may also check the second amplified RF signal 841 for errors such that an operator may be notified whether or not the telemetry message was successfully received. The decoder 900 allows the sensor signal 234 data to be displayed on the remote transponder 800 such as a handheld device. Alternatively, the sensor signal 234 data may be stored in a computer database. The database may add a time stamp and patient information in order to make a complete record of the telemetry event. Combined with other records, trends and behavior may be graphed and analyzed.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, the operation of the bio-sensor system 10 will now be generally described. More specifically, the method of remotely monitoring physiological parameters using the bio-sensor system 10 will be described wherein the bio-sensor system 10 broadly comprises the remote transponder 800 and the on-chip transponder 100 having the sensor 210 and which is implantable in the patient. The method comprises the steps of remotely generating and wirelessly transmitting the scanner signal 882 with the remote transponder 800 wherein the scanner signal 882 contains radio signal power and a telemetry data request. The scanner signal 882 is received at the on-chip transponder 100 whereupon the scanner signal 882 is filtered, amplified and demodulated to generate the message signal 702.",
        "Radio signal power is then collected from the scanner signal 882 and the power signal 602 is generated in response thereto. Simultaneously, upon being powered by the sensor reference voltage signal 642, the sensor 210 senses at least one physiological parameter of the patient in the manner as was described above and generates the analog sensor signal 234. The power signal 602, the analog sensor signal 234 and the message signal 702 are all received at the A/D assembly 300 which then generates the digital signal 372 which is representative of the analog sensor signal. The power signal 602, the message signal 702 and the digital signal 372 are then received at the data processor 400 which prepares the digital signal 372 for modulation. The data processor 400 then generates the data signal 462 which is representative of the digital signal 372. The power signal 602, the message signal 702 and the data signal 462 are received at the RF transmitter 500 which then modulates, amplifies, filters and wirelessly transmits a transmitted signal 502 from the on-chip transponder 100. The remote transponder 800 then received the transmitted signal 502 from the on-chip transponder 100 and extracts data that is representative of the physiological parameter of the patient.",
        "Referring briefly to FIG. 8a, wherein the sensor 210 is configured as the 2-pin glucose sensor 210, the method may further comprise steps for enhancing the stability and precision of the power supplied to the electrode assembly 201 by first tuning the power signal 602 with the first precision resistor 224 to generate the sensor reference voltage signal 642 at the level of about positive 0.7 volts. The sensor reference voltage signal 642 is received at the first operational amplifier 220 which generates the precision sensor reference voltage signal 223. The voltmeter 250 monitors the precision sensor reference voltage signal to establish a sensor 210 operating point. The first operational amplifier 220 cooperates with the voltmeter 250 to buffer the precision sensor reference voltage signal 223 in order to generate a substantially accurate sensor reference voltage signal 226.",
        "The accurate sensor reference voltage signal 226 is applied to the first terminal 202 to cause the reaction with the patient's blood which causes current to discharge from the second terminal 204 in the manner earlier described. The current discharges at the second terminal 204 in proportion to the glucose level. By tuning the second precision resistor 240, which is connected in series to the second operational amplifier 230, a voltage divider is formed with the glucose sensor 210. The second precision resistor 240, in cooperation with the second operational amplifier 230, measures the level of discharging current and generates the sensor signal 234 which is substantially proportional to the glucose level of the patient.",
        "Referring briefly to FIG. 8b, for the case where the sensor 210 is a 3-pin glucose sensor 210 including the third terminal 206 that is co-located with the first and second terminals 204, 206, the method of sensing the glucose level further comprises the steps of diverting a portion of the current away from the second terminal 204. This is performed by discharging current at the third terminal 206 during application of the accurate sensor reference voltage signal 226 to the first terminal 202. The current from the third terminal 206 is passes through the auxiliary control circuit 260 which is connected between the third electrode and the second operational amplifier 230. The auxiliary control circuit 260 monitors and controls the amount of current discharging from the third terminal 206 in order to stabilize the accurate sensor reference voltage signal 226 applied to the first terminal 202 which may increase the operational life of the glucose sensor 210.",

Thus, the particular combination of parts described and illustrated herein is intended to represent only certain embodiments of the present invention, and is not intended to serve as limitations of alternative devices within the spirit and scope of the invention."
