        "As explained in more detail below, lift arms 34 and linear actuators 48a and 48b, commonly referred to as a hi/low mechanism, are configured to position deck support 24 in at least the following positions: a raised or upper position wherein intermediate frame 32 and weigh frame 36 are above base frame 28 (FIGS. 1-6); a first lowered position wherein at least a portion of intermediate frame 32 and/or weigh frame 36 is nested within base frame 28 (FIG. 7); a Trendelenburg position wherein a head end 102 of intermediate frame 32 is lower than a foot end 104 of intermediate frame 32 (FIG. 8); and a Reverse Trendelenburg position wherein foot end 104 of intermediate frame 32 is lower than head end 102 of intermediate frame 32 (FIGS. 9, 10 and 11). One skilled in the art will appreciate that the positions shown in FIGS. 1-11 are exemplary positions and that intermediate frame 32 is positionable in a wide variety of positions relative to base frame 28.",
        "Lift Arms",
        "Referring to FIG. 2, lift arms 34 include a pair of head links 106 pivotably coupled to head end 102 of intermediate frame 32 and slidably and pivotably coupled to base frame 28, a pair of foot links 108 pivotably coupled to foot end 104 of intermediate frame 32 and slidably and pivotably coupled to base frame 28, and a pair of guide links 110 pivotably coupled to respective foot links 108 and pivotably coupled to base frame 28 at a fixed pivot point. Alternatively, the guide links 110 are pivotably coupled to the respective foot links 108, and the intermediate frame 32, or pivotably coupled to the respective head links 106 and the base frame 28, or pivotably coupled to the respective head links 106 and the intermediate frame 32. In further alternative embodiments, two sets of guide links 110 are provided, one set pivotably coupled to the foot links 108 and either the base frame 28 or the intermediate frame 32 and one set coupled to the head links 106 and either the base frame 28 or the intermediate frame 32.",
        "Each head link 106 is slidably coupled to base frame 28 and pivotably coupled to intermediate frame 32. Alternatively, each of the head links 106 is slidably coupled to either the base frame 28 or the intermediate frame 32. As illustratively shown in FIG. 2, each head link 106 is slidably and pivotably coupled to base frame 28 at pivot 113 by a slide block 111. Slide block 111 is pivotably coupled to a lower portion 112 of head link 106 and slidably received in a guide 114 coupled to base frame 28. In one embodiment, the material used for the slide blocks 111 and the guides 114 and the surface characteristics of the slide blocks 111 and the guides 114 are chosen to reduce the coefficient of friction between the slide blocks 111 and the guides 114.",
        "Guide 114 includes an upper channel 116 and a lower channel 118 which define two directions of travel 120 and 121 for slide block 111. Upper channel 116 and lower channel 118 are further configured to restrict the movement of slide block 111 in any direction other than directions of travel 120 and 121. Slide blocks 111 are preferred because they are capable of spreading the load of intermediate frame 32, deck 26 and other patient support components over a larger surface area than other types of couplers. Alternative methods of coupling the head links 106 to the base frame 28 can be used provided that the lower portion of the head links 106 can pivot relative to the base frame 28 and can move along the directions of travel 120, 121. Examples include a roller, a plurality of rollers, or interlocking members.",
        "Illustratively, an upper end 122 of each head link 106 is pivotably coupled to intermediate frame 32 through a cross link 124. Alternatively, the head links 106 are directly pivotably coupled to the intermediate frame 32. In a further alternative, the head links 106 are pivotably coupled to the base frame 28 and slidably and pivotably coupled to the intermediate frame 32.",
        "Cross link 124 extends between each head link 106 and is rigidly coupled to each head link 106. As such, cross link 124 coordinates the simultaneous movement of head links 106. Cross link 124 is received through openings (not shown) formed in intermediate frame 32 and is pivotable relative to intermediate frame 32. In one embodiment, a bearing or other means is used to increase the ease by which cross link 124 pivots relative to intermediate frame 32.",
        "Each foot link 108, is slidably and pivotably coupled to base frame 28. Illustratively each foot link 108 is coupled to base frame 28 at pivot 126 by slide block 128 which is pivotably coupled to a lower portion 130 of foot link 108 and slidably received in a guide 132 coupled to base frame 28. Guide 132 and slide block 128 are generally identical to guide 114 and slide block 111 discussed in conjunction with head links 106. As such, guide 132 is configured to restrict the movement of slide block 128 in any direction other than directions of travel 120 and 121. Alternative methods of coupling the foot links 108 to the base frame 28 can be used provided that the lower portion of the foot links 108 can pivot relative to the base frame 28 and can move along the directions of travel 120, 121. Examples include a roller, a plurality of rollers, or interlocking members.",
        "An upper end 134 of each foot link 108 is pivotably coupled to intermediate frame 32 through a cross link 136. Alternatively, the foot links 108 are directly pivotably coupled to the intermediate frame 32. Cross link 136 is generally identical to cross link 124 and cooperates with intermediate frame 32 and foot links 108 in the same manner as cross link 124 with intermediate frame 32 and head links 106. Alternatively, the upper end 134 of each foot link 108 is slidably and pivotably coupled to the intermediate frame 32 and pivotably coupled to the base frame 28.",
        "Guide links 110 restrict the motion of foot links 108 such that the pivot point 138 between foot links 108 and intermediate frame 32 is restrained to move vertically without moving horizontally. This restriction prevents horizontal movement of intermediate frame 32 relative to base frame 28 during the raising and lowering of intermediate frame 32. This restrained movement prevents intermediate frame 32 from moving through an arc while moving between the upper position of FIG. 2 and the lower position of FIG. 7 so that intermediate frame 32 can be raised and lowered without requiring additional hospital room for clearance.",
        "It will be appreciated that, in order for guide links 110 to perform the restriction function, the distance between pivots 140 (pivot between guide link 110 and foot link 108) and 142 (pivot between guide links 110 and base frame 28) of guide links 110 is one half the distance between pivot 126 (pivot between slide blocks 128 and base frame 28) and pivot 138 (pivot between upper ends 134 of foot links 108 and intermediate frame 32). Further, each guide link 110 is pivotably coupled to the respective foot link 108 at pivot 140 that is one half the distance between pivot 126 of the associated slide block 128 and pivot 138 of the upper end of the respective foot link 108. Thus, the distance between upper pivot 140 of each guide link 110 and the lower pivot 142 of each guide link 110 is equal to the distance between upper pivot 140 of each guide link 110 and upper pivot 138 of each foot link 108. As a result of this link geometry, upper pivots 138 of foot links 108 are maintained in vertical alignment with lower pivot 142 of guide links 110 during the raising and lowering of intermediate frame 32 relative to base frame 28.",
        "Linear Actuators",
        "As stated earlier, linear actuators 48a and 48b provide power to actuate lift arms 34 and in turn to raise and lower intermediate frame 32 relative to base frame 28. Linear actuator 48a is coupled to and actuates head links 106 and linear actuator 48b is coupled to and actuates foot links 108. As such, foot end 104 and head end 102 of intermediate frame 32 can be raised and lowered independent of one another. Alternatively, head links 106 and foot links 108 of the decking system are coupled together such that a single actuator raises and lowers the head end 102 and the foot end 104 of the intermediate frame 32 at the same time.",
        "Illustratively, a first end 146 of linear actuator 48a is coupled to head links 106 through an extension link 148 that is rigidly coupled to cross link 124 which, in turn, is rigidly coupled to head links 106. As shown in FIG. 2, first end 146 is pivotably coupled to extension link 148 through a fastener or pivot pin 150. A second end 152 of linear actuator 48a is coupled to a first bracket 154 which is rigidly coupled to intermediate frame 32. As shown in FIG. 2, second end 152 is pivotably coupled to first bracket 154 through a fastener or pivot pin 156.",
        "Similarly, a first end 158 of linear actuator 48b is coupled to foot links 108 through an extension link 160 that is rigidly coupled to cross link 136 which, in turn, is rigidly coupled to foot links 108. As shown in FIG. 2, first end 158 is pivotably coupled to extension link 160 through a fastener or pivot pin 162. A second end 164 of linear actuator 48b is coupled to a second bracket 166 which is rigidly coupled to intermediate frame 32. Second end 164 is pivotably coupled to second bracket 166 through a fastener or pivot pin 168.",
        "Each actuator 48a and 48b is preferably an electric linear actuator having respective cylinder bodies 170, cylinder rods 172, and motors 604 that operate to extend and retract cylinder rods 172 relative to cylinder bodies 170. As such, actuators 48a and 48b have variable lengths and therefore adjust the distance between pivot pins 150 and 156 and pivot pins 162 and 168, respectively. In one illustrative embodiment, actuators 48a and 48b are Linak actuators, Model No. LA34, available from LINAK U.S. Inc. located at 2200 Stanley Gault Parkway, Louisville Ky. 40223. Further, actuators 48c, 48d, 48e and 48f are also illustratively electric linear actuators, and in one embodiment are also Linak actuators. More particularly, actuator 48c is illustratively a Linak actuator, Model No. LA34 and actuators 48d-48f are illustratively Linak actuators, Model No. LA31. In alternative embodiments, all of the actuators 48 or any one or more of the actuators are other types of electric actuators, pneumatic actuators, hydraulic actuators, mechanical actuators, link systems or other components known to those of ordinary skill in the art for coordinating movement of components relative to one another.",
        "The actuation of either actuator 48a or 48b alone causes either the respective head end 102 of intermediate frame 32 or the respective foot end 104 of intermediate frame 32 to be raised or lowered relative to base frame 28. Referring to FIG. 2, head end 102 of intermediate frame 32 is lowered relative to base frame by the retraction of cylinder rod 172a of actuator 48a. As cylinder rod 172a of actuator 48a is retracted, the distance between pivot pins 150 and 156 is reduced. This reduction in pivot spacing causes extension link 148 to move toward first bracket 154 which in turn causes cross link 124 and head links 106 to rotate in direction 176 about pivot 126. Since lower portions 112 of head links 106 are restrained to move only in directions of travel 120 and 121 of guide 114, the rotation of head links 106 in direction 176 causes lower portions 112 of head links 106 to travel in direction 120. As a result upper ends 122 of head links 106 are lowered relative to base frame 28 and therefore head end 102 of intermediate frame 32 is lowered relative to base frame 28.",
        "Head end 102 of intermediate frame 32 is raised relative to base frame 28 by the extension of cylinder rod 172 of actuator 48a. As cylinder rod 172 of actuator 48a is extended the distance between pivot pins 150 and 156 is increased. This increase in pivot spacing causes extension link 148 to move away from first bracket 154 which, in turn, causes cross link 124 and head links 106 to rotate in a direction 178 counter to direction 176 about pivot 126. The rotation of head links 106 in direction 178 counter to direction 176 causes lower portions 112 of head links 106 to travel in direction 121. As a result, upper ends 122 of head links 106 are raised relative to base frame 28 and therefore, head end 102 of intermediate frame 32 is raised relative to base frame 28.",
        "Foot end 104 of intermediate frame 32 is lowered relative to base frame 28 by the retraction of cylinder rod 172b of actuator 48b. As cylinder rod 172b of actuator 48b is retracted the distance between pivot pins 162 and 168 is reduced. This reduction in pivot spacing causes extension link 160 to move toward second bracket 166 which, in turn, causes cross link 136 and foot links 108 to rotate in direction 180 about pivot 138. Since lower portions 130 of foot links 108 are restrained to move only in directions of travel 120 and 121 of guide 132, the rotation of foot links 108 in direction 180 causes lower portions 130 of foot links 108 to travel in direction 121. As a result, upper ends 134 of foot links 108 are lowered relative to base frame 28 and therefore, foot end 104 of intermediate frame 32 is lowered relative to base frame 28.",
        "Foot end 104 of intermediate frame 32 is raised relative to base frame 28 by the extension of cylinder rod 172b of actuator 48b. As cylinder rod 172b of actuator 48b is extended, the distance between pivots 162 and 168 is increased. This increase in pivot spacing causes extension link 160 to move away from second bracket 166 which, in turn, causes cross link 136 and foot links 108 to rotate in a direction 182 counter to direction 180 about pivot 138. The rotation of foot links 108 in direction 182 counter to direction 180 causes lower portions 130 of foot links 108 to travel in direction 120. As a result, upper ends 134 of foot links 108 are raised relative to base frame 28 and therefore, foot end 104 of intermediate frame 32 is raised relative to base frame 28.",
        "The simultaneous actuation of actuators 48a and 48b causes both head end 102 and foot end 104 of intermediate frame 32 to raise or lower relative to base frame 28. As shown in FIG. 2, the simultaneous extension of both actuators 48a and 48b causes both head end 102 and foot end 104 of intermediate frame 32 to raise relative to base frame 28 and intermediate frame 32 to be spaced apart from base frame 28. The simultaneous retraction of both actuators 48a and 48b causes both head end 102 and foot end 104 of intermediate frame 32 to lower relative to base frame 28. It should be appreciated that actuator 48a can be extended while actuator 48b is retracted, resulting in head end 102 being raised while foot end 104 is lowered, or that actuator 48a can be retracted while actuator 48b is extended, resulting in head end 102 being lowered while foot end 104 is raised.",
        "Further, in an alternative embodiment the direction of one of the actuators 48a, 48b is reversed such that to raise the intermediate frame 32 relative to the base frame 28 a first of the two actuators 48a, 48b is extended and the second actuator 48b, 48a is retracted. Further, to lower the intermediate frame 32 relative to the base frame 28 the second actuator 48b, 48a is extended and the first actuator 48a, 48b is retracted.",
        "Referring further to FIG. 2, deck support 24 is in an upper position when actuators 48a and 48b are both extended. Deck support 24 is moved from the upper position of FIG. 2 to the Trendelenburg position of FIG. 8 by retracting actuator 48a and thus lowering head end 102 of intermediate frame 32. Deck support 24 is returned to the upper position of FIG. 2 by extending actuator 48a back to its prior length. Deck support 24 is moved from the upper position of FIG. 2 to the Reverse Trendelenburg position of FIGS. 9 and 10 by retracting actuator 48b and thus lowering foot end 104. Deck support 24 is returned to the upper position of FIG. 2 by extending actuator 48b back to its prior length.",
        "Deck support 24 is moved from the upper position of FIG. 2 to the lowered position of FIG. 7 by simultaneously retracting actuators 48a and 48b and thus lowering both head end 102 and foot end 104 of intermediate frame 32. Deck support 24 is moved back to the upper position of FIG. 2 from the lowered position of FIG. 7 by simultaneously extending actuators 48a and 48b. It should be appreciated that actuators 48a and 48b can place the patient support 10 in a variety of positions from any starting position and that the upper position shown in FIG. 2 is simply a reference starting position used to explain the operation of the deck support.",
        "Since actuators 48a and 48b retract and extend at substantially the same rates, the simultaneous retraction of actuators 48a and 48b causes intermediate frame 32 to be maintained in a generally horizontal position as it is vertically transitioned from the upper position of FIG. 2 to the lowered position of FIG. 7 and then raised back again to the upper position of FIG. 2. Further, control system 44 is configured to control each actuator 48a-f and therefore can independently control the speed of each actuator 48a-f. Also, as discussed above, guide links 110 are configured to generally maintain the vertical alignment of intermediate frame 32 and base frame 28 such that intermediate frame 32 does not \u201cswing\u201d outwardly or inwardly relative to base frame 28 as intermediate frame 32 is transitioned between various positions.",
        "One of the purposes of intermediate frame 32 being configured to raise and lower relative to base frame 28 is to aid in the ingress of a patient to and egress of a patient from patient support 10. To allow intermediate frame 32 to lower further and thus provide additional assistance in the ingress to and egress of the patient from patient support 10, patient support 10 is configured to provide a lowered position, as shown in FIG. 7, wherein portions of deck support 24 nest within other portions of deck support 24. Thus, an overall height 183 of deck support 24 and, in turn, an overall height of mattress 14 is reduced. Further, by placing patient support 10 in the lowered position of FIG. 7, the possibility of patient injury due to accidental egress from patient support 10 is reduced due to the fact that the patient is closer to the floor 29 than in conventional patient supports.",
        "Nesting Frames",
        "As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, portions of intermediate frame 32 are configured to nest within base frame 28 and/or extend below base frame 28 when intermediate frame is in the lowered position. Alternatively, the base frame 28 can be configured to nest within the intermediate frame 32 when the intermediate frame 32 is in the lowered position. As shown in FIGS. 2, 7 and 8, longitudinally-extending members 184, 186 of intermediate frame 32 define a first outer width 188 of intermediate frame 32 that is less than an inner width 190 defined by longitudinally extending members 192, 194 of base frame 28 and lifting arms 34. Further, an outer length 195 of intermediate frame 32 is less than an inner length 197 of base frame 28 and lifting arms 34, illustratively shown as the separation between cross link 185, shown in FIGS. 2 and 8, of head links 106 and cross link 187 of foot links 108. As such, as intermediate frame 32 is lowered to the lowered position, portions of intermediate frame 32 are received within an interior region 196 defined by base frame 28 and lifting arms 34, thereby reducing overall height 183 of deck support 24.",
        "It should be noted that when deck support 24 is in the lowered position, head links 106, foot links 108 and guide links 110 are rotated beyond horizontal, such that pivots 126, 138, 140 are generally lower than pivots 142, 143, 144. In one embodiment, head links 106, foot links 108 and guide links 110 are generally rotated from approximately 80\u00b0 above horizontal in the upper position of FIG. 2 to approximately 10\u00b0 below horizontal in the lowered position of FIG. 7. As shown in FIG. 2, intermediate frame 32 includes a plurality of gussets 208 which each include a stop surface 210. Stop surface 210 is configured to contact and rest upon foot links 104 and head links 106, respectively, when intermediate frame 32 is fully lowered. Stop surfaces 210 are configured to prevent other portions of patient support 10, such as siderails 20, 22, from contacting base frame 28. Alternatively, the stop surface 210 is configured to contact and rest upon the base frame 28.",
        "It is further contemplated that portions of weigh frame 36 are configured to nest within base frame 28 when intermediate frame 32 is in the lowered position. Longitudinally extending members 198, 200, shown in FIGS. 3, 4 and 13, of weigh frame 36 define an outer width 202 of weigh frame 36 that may be less than inner width 190 of base frame 28 and lifting arms 34 (FIG. 7). Further, an outer length 204 of weigh frame 36 may be less than inner length 197 of base frame 28 and lifting arms 34. As such, as intermediate frame 32 is lowered to the lowered position, portions of weigh frame 36 as well as intermediate frame 32 may nest within or extend below base frame 28 thereby further reducing overall height 183 of deck support 24.",
        "Weigh Frame",
        "As noted above, intermediate frame 32 is coupled to weigh frame 36. As shown in FIGS. 13 and 14, weigh frame 36 includes longitudinally extending members 198, 200 and transversely extending members 211, 213. Load cells 220, 222, 224, 226 are coupled to a respective end of longitudinally extending members 198, 200.",
        "Referring further to FIG. 14, load cell 226 is shown. The description below of load cell 226 is descriptive of all of load cells 220, 222, 224, 226 unless specifically noted otherwise. Load cell 226 includes a load member, load beam, or cell block (hereinafter \u201ccell block 221\u201d) that is mounted at one of the four corners of the weigh frame 36. Conventional strain gages (not shown) are included in load cell 226 and are coupled to cell block 221. The strain gages operate in a conventional manner to provide an indication of the load supported by load cell 226. That is, a known input voltage is applied to input leads (not shown) coupled to the strain gages and, as cell blocks 221 deflect due to the application of a load, the resistance of the strain gages changes resulting in a change in an output signal generated on output leads (not shown) coupled to the strain gages. In the illustrative embodiment, the input and output leads are bundled together in a cable (not shown) that is routed between load cell 226 and conventional signal conditioning circuitry (not shown).",
        "Block 221 is coupled to a mounting bar 223 of weigh frame 36 by suitable fasteners, such as bolts (not shown).

A stud 225 is coupled to block 221 and includes a socket portion 227 and a ball portion 228. Socket portion 227 is configured to capture ball portion 228 and to allow ball portion 228 to rotate relative to socket portion 227.",
        "Load cells 220, 222, 224, 226 are further configured to be coupled to transversely extending members 215, 217 of intermediate frame 32, shown in FIG. 2.

Referring to FIGS. 2, 3 and 15, a stud 229 is fastened to each opposing end of transversely extending members 215 and 217 of intermediate frame 32 and is configured to be received by ball portion 228 respective of load cells 220, 222, 224, 226. As such, studs 229 and ball portions 228 couple weigh frame 36 to intermediate frame 32.",
        "The weight of weigh frame 36 and anything supported by weigh frame 36, such as deck 26, mattress 14, and a patient, is transmitted to load cells 220, 222, 224, 226. This weight deflects or otherwise changes a characteristic of load cells 220, 222, 224, 226 that is detected to determine the total weight supported thereby. By subtracting a known weight of weigh frame 36, deck 26, mattress 14 and any other bed components supported on weigh frame 36, the weight of the patient positioned on patient support 10 can be determined. Additional description of illustrative load cells and methods for determining a patient's weight, position in the bed, and other indications provided by load cells is provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/669,707, filed Sep. 26, 2000, titled Load Cell Apparatus, to Mobley et al., the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.

Leg section 42 is further coupled to actuator 48e. In the illustrated embodiment, actuator 48e is slidably coupled to a bracket 246 of leg section 42 and is pivotably coupled to a bracket 248 of weigh frame 36. Actuator 48e is configured to raise a second end 250 of leg section 42. As such, second end 250 of leg section 42 can be raised or lowered relative to first end 244, by the extension or retraction of the length of cylinder 172e of actuator 48e.",
        "Deck 26 is configured to support mattress 14. As shown in FIG. 16, head section 38 and seat section 40 each includes angled side walls 260a, 260b and 262a, 262b, respectively. Further, head section 38 and seat section 40 each includes substantially flat lower deck portions, floors or walls 264 and 266 connected to side walls 260a, 260b and 262a, 262b, respectively. Angled side walls 260a, 260b and floor 264 and angled side walls 262a, 262b and floor 266 each cooperate to define a support surface for a portion of mattress 14. As shown in FIG. 16, the angled walls 260a, 260b and 262a, 262b are oriented to form obtuse angles with their respective floors 264 and 266. In one illustrative embodiment, the angle formed is approximately 135 degrees. According to alternative embodiments of the present disclosure, the obtuse angles between the side walls and the floor may range from slightly more than 90 degrees to slightly less than 180 degrees. According to other alternative embodiments of the present disclosure, the angles are right angles or acute angles.",
        "The lowered central portion, generally corresponding to floors 264 and 266 of head section 38 and seat section 40, respectively, provides ample space for mattress 14 to be positioned. By having a lowered central portion, the pivot of a patient's hip when the patient is positioned on mattress 14 is more in line with pivots 232, 237 of head section 38 and seat section 40 and provides ample space to provide a mattress 14 that provides adequate support for the patient. In one illustrative embodiment, the position of the pivot of the hip of the patient is about two inches above the pivots 232, 237 of the head and seat sections 38 and 40 of the deck 26. In another illustrative embodiment, the position of the pivot of the hip of the patient is generally in line with the pivots 232, 237 of the head and seat sections 38 and 40 of the deck 26. By minimizing the distance between the pivot of the patient's hip and the pivots 232, 237 of the head and seat sections 38 and 40, the amount of shear exerted against the patient is reduced as either the head or seat 38, 40 section is raised or lowered. By reducing the amount of shear exerted against the patient, the possibility of the patient experiencing skin breakdown is reduced.",

Referring to FIG. 19, this translates into about a two inch thick section 270 of mattress 14 at the edge of the deck 26. The thickness of the mattress 14 at the edge of the deck 26, illustratively about two inches, provides needed support for the lateral transfer of the patient into and out of patient support 10. Further, the thickness of the mattress 14 at the edge of the deck 26 provides a grip 271 for the patient to grasp to aid in the egress from patient support 10.

Similarly, second end 304 of actuator 48f is coupled to a bracket 305 of second leg section member 292. To extend second leg section member 292 relative to first leg section member 290, cylinder rod 172f of actuator 48f is extended. To retract second leg section member 292 relative to first leg section member 290, cylinder rod 172f of actuator 48f is retracted. In the preferred embodiment, actuator 48f is an electric actuator, such as a Linak actuator, and is controlled by control system 44 as described herein. In alternative embodiments the actuator 48f is a mechanical actuator, a pneumatic actuator, a hydraulic actuator, a link system or other suitable means to move the second leg section member 292 relative to the first leg section member 290.",
        "First leg section member 290 and second leg section member 292 are maintained in longitudinal alignment at least in part by guide members 306a, 306b.

        "As previously mentioned, leg section 42 of deck 26 is adjustable in length so that it can be moved from a retracted position to an extended position. Preferably, the length of leg section 42 is adjusted depending upon the height of the patient positioned on mattress 14 so that the patient's foot is positioned adjacent to footboard 18, shown in FIG. 1. For example, leg section 42 is extended to position the heels of a tall patient adjacent to footboard 18. Leg section 42 is retracted to position the heels of a shorter patient adjacent to footboard 18.",
        "Also illustratively, mattress 14 is configured to be extended and retracted with leg section 42 as discussed in more detail herein. As such, the heel of the patient may be maintained over a given section of mattress 14, such as heel pressure relief member 2154 (FIGS. 93-95) which is configured to provide heel-pressure relief.",
        "According one embodiment of the present disclosure, the length of leg section 42 corresponds to the position of head section 38. For example, if head section 38 is raised to the titled position as shown in FIG. 21, leg section 42 of deck 26 is controlled by control system 44 to automatically extend by a given distance. If head section 38 is lowered, leg section 42 is controlled by control system 44 to automatically retract to its pre-extended position. More particularly, control system 44 coordinates movement of head section 38 and leg section 42 by simultaneously controlling actuators 48c and 48f. By corresponding the extension and retraction of leg section 42 with the movement of head section 38, the patient's foot is maintained above heel pressure relief member 2154 of mattress 14. Furthermore, if footboard 18 is used as a foot prop, the patient's foot is maintained at a steady distance relative to footboard 18 during raising and lowering of head section 38.",
        "Preferably, the degree of automatic extension of leg section 42 is a function of the angle of head section 38. The further up head section 38 is raised from a generally linear relationship with seat section 40, the more leg section 42 is extended so that heel pressure relief member 2154 is continuously positioned under the patient's heel throughout the range of motion of head section 38.",
        "Mattress Deck Articulation",
        "As stated previously, patient support 10 is positionable in a plurality of positions. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 3 and 22, head section 38, seat section 40 and leg section 42 are in a linear relationship relative to each other. In one illustrative embodiment, head section 38, seat section 40 and leg section 42 are placed in the linear relationship by control system 44 in response to a single button being depressed on one of controllers 50, 52, 54.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4, head section 38 is rotated about pivot 232 such that second end 235 is raised relative to first end 231. Second end 235 is raised by control system 44 controlling actuator 48c to further extend cylinder 172 of actuator 48c. In one illustrative embodiment, head section 38 is raised by control system 44 in response a first button being depressed on one of controllers 50, 52, 54 and lowered by control system 44 in response to a second button being depressed on same controller 50, 52, 54.",
        "Also, shown in FIG. 4, seat section 40 is rotated about pivot 237 such that second end 239 is raised relative to first end. Second end 239 is raised by control system 44 controlling actuator 48d to further extend cylinder 172d of actuator 48d. Leg section 42, in FIG. 4, is raised due to the rotation of seat section 40 and the coupling of leg section 42 to seat section 40, but leg section 42 remains in a generally horizontal position due to the rotation of actuator 48e. In one illustrative embodiment, seat section 40 is raised by control system 44 in response to a first button being depressed on same and lowered by control system 44 in response to a second button being depressed on the same controller 50, 52, 54.",
        "Referring to FIG. 5, head section 38 and seat section 40 are in generally the same position as in FIG. 4. However, second end 250 of leg section 42 has been lowered such that second end 250 is lower relative to first end 244. Second end 250 is lowered relative to first end 244 by control system 44 controlling actuator 48e to further retract cylinder 172e of actuator 48e. In one illustrative embodiment, head section 38, seat section 40 and leg section 42 are placed in the configuration shown in FIG. 5 by control system 44 in response to a chair button on one of controllers 50, 52, 54 being depressed. In an alternate embodiment, the leg section 42 is raised by control system 44 in response to a leg section up button being depressed on one of the controllers 50, 52, 54, and lowered by control system 44 in response to a leg section down button being depressed on the same controller 50, 52, 54.",
        "Referring further to FIGS. 4, 5, 18 and 20, the weight of actuator 48e and leg section 42 maintains a first end 320 of actuator 48e adjacent a first end 322 of slot 324 in bracket 246 as cylinder 172e of actuator 48e is retracted, as opposed to first end 320 of actuator 48e traveling towards a second end 326 of slot 324. The configuration of deck in FIG. 5 is an illustrative first chair-like position.",
        "Further, leg section actuator 48e is lengthened by control system 44 when seat section 40 is lowered from the elevated position shown in FIG. 5. Leg section actuator 48e is lengthened to prevent any interference between leg section 42 and seat section 40.",
        "FIG. 6 illustrates leg section 42 not being movable between the position of leg section 42 in FIG. 4 and the position of leg section in FIG. 5, due to an obstruction 330 impeding the movement of leg section 42. Example obstructions include a cart, a wheelchair, a table, a trashcan or any other item. As shown in FIG. 6, when leg section 42 encounters obstruction 330 first end 320 of actuator 48e travels along elongated slot 324 in the direction of arrow 325 toward second end 326 of slot 324. As such, slot 324 serves as a safety device to avoid crushing obstruction 330 and to avoid destruction of actuator 48e and damage to patient support 10.",
        "The length of slot 324 is selected to allow actuator 48e to move from a fully extended position to a fully retracted position while first end 320 of actuator 48e travels in slot 324. As such, actuator 48e will encounter the end of its range of motion or travel (fully retracted) before or coincident with first end 320 of actuator 48e reaching second end 326 of slot 324. Therefore, leg section 42 will not crush or otherwise damage obstruction 330 due to the continued pressure applied by actuator 48e, actuator 48e will not be damaged due to a larger than expected load being placed on actuator 48e, and patient support 10 will not be damaged.",
        "Alternative methods may be used to keep the leg section 42 from damaging the obstruction and to keep from damaging the actuator 48e. A first example is to monitor the load placed on the actuator 48e with the control system 44 and to disengage or reverse the motion of the actuator 48e in response to a larger than expected load for retracting the actuator 48e. A second example is to place a pressure sensor along the bottom of the leg section 42 and to disengage the actuator 48e when a higher than expected pressure is detected. An illustrative sensor may be the obstacle detection system of the present invention disclosed herein. Other known safety systems may also be used.",
        "In alternative embodiments, the elongated slot 324 is located on the bracket 248 attached to the weigh frame 36 and the actuator 48e is pivotably coupled to the leg section 42 and slidably and pivotably coupled to the weigh frame 36. In a further alternative embodiment, the elongated slot 324 is located on the joint between the leg section 42 and the seat section 40 such that the leg section 42 and the seat section 40 are pivotably and slidably coupled, the leg section 42 and the actuator 48e are pivotably coupled and the actuator 48e and the weigh frame 36 are pivotably coupled. In still further alternative embodiments, the elongated slot 324 feature is incorporated into the configuration for the head section 38, is incorporated into the configuration for the seat section 40, or is incorporated into the lifting arms 34 configuration.",
        "Referring to FIG. 10, a second chair-like configuration of patient support 10 is shown. Head section 38, seat section 40 and leg section 42 of deck 26 are generally oriented relative to intermediate frame 32 as shown in FIG. 5. However, deck support 24 is positioned generally in a Reverse Trendelenburg position, wherein foot end 104 of intermediate frame 32 is lower than head end 102 of intermediate frame 32. Deck support 24 is placed in the second chair-like position by retracting actuator 48b, shown in FIG. 2, and thus lowering foot links 108. In one illustrative embodiment, patient support 10 is placed in the configuration shown in FIG. 10 by control system 44 in response to a first button being depressed on one of controllers 50, 52, 54 and in response to a second button being depressed on one of controllers 50, 52, 54. In an alternative embodiment, the patient support is placed in the configuration shown in FIG. 10 in response to a button being depressed on the controllers. In a further alternate embodiment, the patient support 10 is placed in the configuration of FIG. 5 in response to a first chair button on one of controllers 50, 52, 54 being depressed and is placed in the configuration of FIG. 10 in response to a second chair button on the same controller 50, 52, 54 being depressed.",
        "A further safety device 340 is shown in FIG. 17 and is coupled to leg section 42. Safety device 340 includes bracket 305 rigidly coupled to leg section 42 and a roller 344 rotatably coupled to bracket 305. Safety device 340 similar to slot 324 protects patient support 10 from damage and also protects an obstruction, such as obstruction 330 or the floor 29 (FIG. 6), from damage. Alternatively, the roller 344 of the safety device 340 is directly coupled to or integrated with the leg section 42, thereby eliminating the bracket 305.",
        "In FIG. 11, patient support 10 is transitioned to the second-chair like configuration, however either due to the fact that leg section 42 is extended, discussed in more detail herein, or that deck support 24 is somewhat lowered, second end 250 of leg section 42 contacts the floor and could potentially be damaged prior to patient support 10 fully transitioning to the second chair like position. As shown in FIG. 11, safety device 340 is configured to translate second end 250 of leg section 42 in a direction 341 while leg section 42 rotates in a direction 343 to avoid damage to leg section 42.",
        "As second end 250 of leg section 42 is translated in direction 341 and leg section 42 is rotated in direction 343 relative to seat section, first end 320 of actuator 48e is traveling within slot 324. As discussed earlier in connection with FIG. 6, slot 324 allows the actuator 48e to continue to retract without further lowering leg section 42. However, in the current case, wherein patient support 10 is transitioning from the first chair-like configuration of FIG. 5 to the second chair-like configuration of FIG. 10, actuator 48e is not retracting. In the current case of FIGS. 10 and 11, first end 320 of actuator 48e, a fixed link (since not retracting or extending), travels within slot 324 and thus leg section 42 rotates to avoid crushing the obstruction or causing damage to the patient support 10. As such, safety device 340 functions in concert with slot 324. It should be appreciated that roller 344 reduces the friction between the floor 29 and leg section 42, thereby allowing leg section 42 to more easily rotate and translate.",
        "A further instance wherein safety device 340 protects both leg section 42 and an obstruction from damage is when deck 26 is in a linear configuration with leg section 42 in an extended position and the patient support 10 is moved to a Reverse Trendelenburg position from a low position. As shown in FIG. 12, patient support 10 is transitioning from a low position, wherein both actuators 48a and 48b, shown in FIG. 2, are generally retracted, to a Reverse Trendelenburg position, wherein actuator 48b remains generally retracted and actuator 48a is generally extended to raise head end 102 of intermediate frame 32 relative to foot end 104. In such a configuration, the second end 250 of leg section 42 could either contact the floor 29 or an obstruction 348, such as a foot. In either case, safety device 340 and safety device 324 cooperate to rotate leg section 42 relative to seat section 40 and thereby reduce the likelihood of damage to both leg section 42 and the obstruction 348.",
        "CPR Configuration",
        "Often it is required to configure patient support 10 in a CPR configuration which is tailored to assist a caregiver in providing CPR to the patient supported on patient support 10. In one illustrative example, a CPR configuration is defined by placing the head, seat and leg sections 38, 40, 42 in a generally linear relationship and to inflate an upper bladder assembly 2122 to an elevated or a maximum pressure in the manner further described herein. In a further illustrative CPR configuration, the head, seat and leg sections 38, 40, 42 are placed in a generally linear relationship, the upper bladder assembly 2122 is inflated to an elevated or a maximum pressure and decking support 24 is oriented such that head end 102 is lower relative to foot end 104, generally a Trendelenburg position as shown in FIG. 9.",

The details of control system 44 and how control system 44 controls actuators 48a-f and pump 64 are further described herein.",
        "Illustratively, patient support 10 is placed in the preferred CPR configuration by manually lowering head section 38 to a lowered position and providing an indication to control system 44 which, in turn, controls actuators 48d and 48e to place head, seat and leg sections 38, 40, 42 in a linear relationship, controls pump 64 to inflate upper bladder assembly 2122 to the desired pressure, and controls actuators 48a and 48b of deck support 24 to lower head end 102 relative to foot end 104. Referring to FIG. 18, both the manual lowering of head section 38 and the providing of an indication to control system 44 are initiated by the actuation of a first or user input 350 from a first state corresponding to an off or inactive condition to a second state corresponding to an on or active condition and are continued as long as first input 350 remains in the on or active condition.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 13, 16, 18, 23 and 24, first input 350 includes a handle 352 positioned adjacent a longitudinal side of head section 38. As shown in FIG. 24, a pair of first inputs 350 are provided, each first input member 350 being supported adjacent opposing right or left longitudinal sides of the head section 38. In the following description, the first inputs 350 and related components adjacent the left and right sides will be specifically identified by the respective reference number followed by reference letter \u201ca\u201d or \u201cb\u201d. It should be appreciated that both first inputs 350a and 350b have identical components and are mirror images of each other. Further, each first input 350a and 350b is configured to function independently of the other first input 350a and 350b. Each handle 352 is coupled to a handle bracket 354 which is rotatably coupled to a bracket 356 which is rigidly coupled to head section 38. Handle bracket 354 is rotatably coupled to bracket 356 by a first fastener 358. The degree of rotation of handle bracket 354 relative to bracket 356 is limited by a stop, illustratively fastener 360 (FIG. 23), which is received in an elongated slot 362 in handle bracket 354.",
        "In one illustrative embodiment, handle 352 includes an indicia 353, shown in FIG. 16, that indicates that the handle corresponds to a CPR condition. Illustrative indicia includes wording such as \u201cCPR\u201d or other text, color-coding, embossed characters or combinations thereof. In alternative embodiments, the indicia is a part of a pedal, a button, a switch, a lever arm, or other suitable actuatable members Referring further to FIG. 23, each handle bracket 354 includes a flange 364 that is configured to couple a first end 366 of a cable 368. Bracket 356 includes a flange 370 configured to couple a first end 372 of a cable housing 374. Cable 368 is free to translate or move within cable housing 374. As such, as handle bracket 354 is rotated in direction 376 relative to bracket 356, cable 368 is extended from cable housing 374 generally in direction 378. As explained later, cable 368 biases in direction 380, in the absence of an external force applied to handle 352, thereby causing handle bracket 354 and handle 352 to rotate in direction 381, opposite direction 376.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 24-28, a second end 382 of each cable 368 and a second end 384 of each cable housing 374 are coupled to an actuator assembly 386 which, in turn, is coupled to actuator 48c. Actuator assembly 386 includes a housing 388 coupled to cylinder rod 172 of actuator 48c by retainers 390, shown in FIGS. 24 and 25. Flange 392 extends from a top portion 394 of housing 388 and is configured to couple to second end 384 of each cable housing 374. A slide bracket 396 is slidably coupled to top portion 394 of housing 388. Slide bracket 396 receives second end 382 of each cable 368 in one of the plurality of slots 400 defined by a plurality of upwardly extending flanges 402 of slide bracket 396. A further flange 404 of slide bracket 396 is coupled to a release pin 406 of actuator 48c. As known in the art, release pin 406 of actuator 48c is configured to allow cylinder rod 172c of actuator 48c to freely move relative to cylinder body 170c, such that rod 172c can be freely extended from or retracted within cylinder body 170c.",
        "Slide bracket 396 is coupled to each handle bracket 354 through cables 368. As such, the rotation of either handle 352a, 352b by a caregiver rotates respective handle bracket 354a, 354b which, in turn, translates first end 366a, 366b of cable 368a, 368b away from first end 372a, 372b of cable housing 374a, 374b, which translates second end 382a, 382b of cable 368a, 368b toward second end 384a, 384b of cable housing 374a, 374b in a direction 408 (FIG. 26). The translation of either cable 368a, 368b in direction 408 translates both slide bracket 396 and release pin 406 in direction 408. As such, while the caregiver keeps either handle 352a, 352b in its rotated position, cylinder rod 172c of actuator 48c is freely moveable relative to cylinder body 170c of actuator 48c and head section 38 may be manually lowered or raised.",
        "As known in the art, release pin 406 is biased in direction 410 counter to direction 408. As release pin 406 moves in direction 410, cylinder rod 172c of actuator 48c is no longer freely movable relative to cylinder body 170 of actuator 48c. Therefore, when the caregiver releases both handles 352a, 352b release pin 406 due to its bias translates slide bracket 396 in direction 410 which in turn through respective cables 368a, 368b rotates handle bracket 354a, 354b and handle 352a, 352b in direction 381 (FIG. 23). As such, actuator 48c is once again actuatable by control system 44 instead of manually.",
        "Referring to FIG. 25, as the caregiver manually lowers head section 38, a damper 430 is provided to reduce the rate at which head section 38 is lowered thereby ensuring that head section 38 does not abruptly move to the lowered position. Illustratively, damper 430 is a gas spring 432 which is pivotably coupled to weigh frame 36 and slidably and pivotably coupled to head section 38. A first end 434 of gas spring 432 is received in an elongated slot 436 of a bracket 438 which is rigidly coupled to head section 38. As head section 38 is lowered from the elevated position to an intermediate position, first end 434 of damper 430 travels from a first end 440 of slot 436, generally corresponding to the elevated position, towards a second end 442 of slot 436, generally corresponding to the intermediate position. In an illustrative embodiment, the intermediate position corresponds to a position approximately two-thirds of the travel distance from the elevated position to the lowered position.",
        "Gas spring 432 has an uncompressed state generally corresponding to head section 38 being positioned between the intermediate position and the elevated position and a compressed state generally corresponding to head section 38 being positioned between the intermediate position and the lowered position. As head section 38 moves from the intermediate position to the lowered position, first end 434 of gas spring 432 stays proximate to second end 442 of slot 436 and a rod 444 of gas spring 432 is forced to slidably move into a housing 446 of gas spring 432 against the biasing force exerted by gas spring 432. In general, gas spring 432 prefers to be in the uncompressed state and resists movement to the compressed state. As such, gas spring 432 resists the movement of head section 38 from the intermediate position to the lowered position and thereby slows the rate of travel of head section 38 to the lowered position.",
        "Gas spring 432 is of conventional design. In alternative embodiments, other types of dampers may be used. Example dampers include compressible foam, air bladders, compressible springs, and other suitable damping means.",
        "Referring to FIG. 26, housing 388 further includes a second input or control 448 that is connected to control system 44. Illustratively, second input/CPR release 448 is a switch which is engaged by slide bracket 396. When switch 448 is closed, control system 44 receives an indication that switch 4148s been closed. Control system 44 proceeds to place the other portions of patient support 10 in the preferred CPR configuration. First, control system 44, if needed, actuates actuators 48d and 48e to place seat section 40 and leg section 42 in a linear relationship with head section 38 corresponding to head section 38 being in a lowered position. Second, control system 44, if needed, inflates upper bladder assembly 2122 to the desired pressure. Third, control system 44, if needed, actuates actuators 48a and 48b to lower head end 102 of decking support 24 relative to foot end 104 of decking support 24. If switch 448 remains closed, control system 44 preferably lowers head end 102 about 12\u00b0 to about 15\u00b0 relative to foot end 104.",
        "If switch 448 is opened as a result of the caregiver releasing handle 352 before control system 44 completes the aforementioned tasks, control system 44 aborts the uncompleted tasks. For example, if the caregiver could release handle 352 when head end 102 is approximately 5\u00b0 lower than foot end 104. It is understood that switch 448 may be located in a variety of locations and activated in a variety of ways. For instance, switch 448 may be placed on handle 352 or handle bracket 354. In alternate embodiments, the handle 352 is replaced by a foot pedal, a button, a switch, a lever arm or other suitable actuatable members.",
        "Referring to FIG. 28, a second embodiment slide bracket 420 is shown. Slide bracket 420 is made from a plastic material and generally functions similar to slide bracket 396. Slide bracket 420 is slidably coupled to housing 388, is coupled to release pin 406, and is configured to engage switch 448. Slide bracket 420 is further coupled to second ends 3822, 382b of cable 368a, 368b.",
        "Referring to FIG. 30, second end 382 of each cable 368 includes a retainer 421 which is received within a recess 422 on slide bracket 420. Illustratively, the retainer 421 may comprise a spherical member or a disk crimped on the second end 382 of cable 368. In order to enter recess 422, retainer 421 on second end 382 must pass by detent 424 which is configured to retain second end 382 in recess 422.",
        "Caster Braking System",
        "Referring to FIGS. 29-33, patient support 10 further includes a caster braking system 450. The caster braking system 450 interconnects each caster device 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d to provide simultaneous braking of casters devices 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d. Each caster device 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d is associated with a foot brake pedal 452a, 452b, 452c, 452d. To simultaneously brake all caster devices 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d, the caregiver steps on one of foot brake pedals 452 and caster braking system 450 locks all four caster devices 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d against rolling. In alternative embodiments the caster devices 30 are brake/steer caster devices opposed to simply brake caster devices.",
        "Each caster device 30 includes a braking mechanism (not shown) that is coupled to a caster-brake link, illustratively a faceted shaft such as hexagonal shaft 453, such that rotation of hexagonal shaft 453 engages the braking mechanism. As shown in FIG. 32, each hexagonal shaft 453 is received within a sleeve 454 of caster device 30 wherein shaft 453 is coupled to the braking mechanism. Additional description of a caster braking system similar to the caster braking system 450 of the present disclosure including the illustrative braking mechanism is provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/263,039, filed Mar. 5, 1999, to Mobley et al., entitled Caster and Braking System, and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,321,878 on Nov. 27, 2001, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein. According to alternative embodiments of the present disclosure other configurations of caster braking and/or steering systems with or without simultaneous locking functions are provided for use with the foot brake pedal 452 and caster-brake link of the present disclosure.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 29 and 31, a first end 455 of hexagonal shaft 453 is coupled to foot pedal 452. A second end 456 of hexagonal shaft 453 is coupled to a rod 457. Rods 457a, 457b interconnect transversely spaced caster pairs 30a, 30b and 30c, 30d, respectively. Rod 457a is coupled to hexagonal shafts 453a and 453b and rod 457 is coupled to hexagonal shafts 453c and 453d. As such, the braking of either caster device 30a or caster device 30b results in the braking of the other caster device of caster device 30a and caster device 30b. Similarly, the braking of either caster device 30c or caster device 30d results in the braking of the other caster device 30c or caster device 30d.",
        "Further, transversely spaced caster device pairs 30a, 30b and 30c, 30d are interconnected by a longitudinally extending brake links 458a, 458b, respectively. Brake links 458a, 458b are configured to interact with the caster device pairs 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d such that the braking of any one caster device 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d simultaneously brakes the remaining caster devices 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 29 and 32, a first end 460 of brake link 458a is pivotably coupled to a bracket 462a by a fastener 464. Illustratively bracket 462 is a U-shaped bracket having a first leg 466 and a second leg 468. The lower portions of legs 466, 468 are configured to pivotably couple to brake link 458. Bracket 462 further includes a generally hexagonal opening for coupling bracket 462 to hexagonal shaft 453.",
        "In operation, a caregiver depresses one of the foot pedals 452, such as foot pedal 452a, to simultaneously brake all four caster devices 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d. Illustratively, foot pedals 452 are shown on a first side of each caster device 30. Alternatively, the foot pedals 452 may be located on the other side of the caster devices 30 or each caster device 30 could have more than a single foot pedal 452 associated with the caster device 30. The depressed foot pedal 452a causes the rotation of hexagonal shaft 453a in direction 470 as illustrated in FIG. 29.",
        "The rotating of hexagonal shaft 453a in turn engages the braking mechanism (not shown) of caster device 30a, rotates rod 457a in direction 470 and rotates bracket 462a in direction 470. The rotation of rod 457a further rotates hexagonal shaft 453a in direction 470 thereby engaging the brake mechanism of caster device 30b. The rotation of bracket 462a translates brake link 458a in a direction 472. The translation of brake link 458a in direction 472 results in the rotation of bracket 462c in direction 470 which, in turn, rotates hexagonal shaft 453c in direction 470, thereby engaging the brake mechanism of caster device 30c. The braking mechanism of caster device 30d is engaged by the rotation of hexagonal shaft 453d either through the translation of brake link 458b similar to the translation of brake link 458a and/or through the rotation of rod 457b similar to the rotation of rod 457a. In alternative embodiments, the caster braking system 450 includes only two transverse rods 457 and a single brake link 458 or two brake links 458 and a single transverse rod 457.",
        "In order to unlock the caster braking system 450 of the present invention, one of the four pedals 452, such as pedal 452a is rotated in a direction 473 counter to the direction 470, thereby disengaging the braking mechanism of caster device 30a. The braking devices of casters 30b, 30c, 30d are disengaged in a manner similar to how they are engaged through rods 457a, 457b and brake links 458a, 458b.",
        "As stated previously, it is advantageous to lower intermediate frame 32 as low as possible to the floor to aid egress from and ingress to patient support 10 and to prevent injury in case of accidental fall from patient support 10. The configuration of caster braking system 450 has a low profile which provides additional clearance for deck 26, siderails 20, 22 and other patient support components as deck support 24 is lowered. As such, intermediate frame 32 can be further lowered. As shown in FIG. 31, brake links 458a, 458b of caster brake system 450 extends through longitudinal frame member 192 and brake link 458b extends through longitudinal frame member 194. As shown in FIG. 33, brake links 458 are positioned lower than hexagonal rods 453 such that a top surface 474, 476 of longitudinal frame members 192, 194 can be lower to the floor 29. Therefore, greater clearance is provided and intermediate frame 32 can be further lowered relative to base frame 28.",
        "Control System",
        "Referring now to FIG. 35, control system 44 includes various controls, interfaces, sensors, and actuators that communicate via a plurality of control modules (described below) connected together by a network 510. A control system having certain characteristics in common with control system 44 is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,771,511 (hereinafter \u201cthe '511 patent\u201d), which is hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. Unlike the peer-to-peer network described in the '511 patent, network 510 is a controller area network (CAN) having a serial bus connecting the modules, each of which includes a controller, a transceiver and associated electronics. In one embodiment, the bus includes a twisted pair of wire conductors. In general, each module is capable of transmitting data on the bus (when the bus is idle), and multiple modules can simultaneously access the bus. Information transmissions (or messages) are not addressed for receipt by a specific module. Instead, as will be further described below, each message is broadcast on the bus to all modules, and includes an identifier that each module uses to determine whether to process the message. If the message is relevant to a particular module, it is processed. Otherwise, it is ignored.",
        "As shown in FIG. 35, seven modules are connected to network 510 for controlling the operation of patient support 10. The modules include a logic module 512, a power supply module 514, a scale/ppm module 516, a dynamic surface module 518, a left caregiver module 520, a right caregiver module 522, and a sidecomm module 524. With reference to FIG. 35B, logic module 512 is electrically coupled to detachable siderail controller 50 (or patient pendant(s)), CPR release switch 448, DC motors 604 of linear actuators 48, and a plurality of sensors including side rail position sensors 60, a head up sensor 534, a head down sensor 536, a foot sensor 538, a foot safety detect sensor 540, a knee contour sensor 542, a bed-not-down sensor 544, and motor sensors 546.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 35D, power supply module 514 is electrically coupled to obstacle detection device 58, a night light 548, foot pedal controls 56, battery 46, a battery charger 552, pneumatic pump 64, and power conditioning circuitry 556. Power supply module 514 further includes a connector (not shown) for receiving a test device 558 for performing various diagnostic and test functions. Power conditioning circuitry 556 is connected to a conventional AC plug 45. With reference to FIG. 35A, scale/ppm module 516 is electrically coupled to the load cells 220, 222, 224, 226 connected to weigh frame 36, and to a bed exit sensor 562.",
        "With reference to FIG. 35A, dynamic surface module 518 is electrically coupled to a plurality of solenoids 564 for controlling characteristics of mattress 14, and a plurality of pressure transducers 566 associated with mattress 14 for sensing air pressures of various components of mattress 14. Left caregiver control module 520 is electrically coupled to first pair of permanent siderail controllers 52 mounted to left head end siderail 20. Right caregiver control module 522 is similarly electrically coupled to first pair of permanent siderail controllers 54 mounted to right head end siderail 20. The configuration and operation of first and second pair of permanent siderail controllers 52, 54 are further described elsewhere herein. Finally, with reference to FIG. 35C, sidecomm module 524 is electrically coupled to room lighting controls 568, a nurse call control 570, a remote network interface 572, entertainment equipment 574 (e.g., radio and television), and a brake-not-set sensor 576.",
        "It should be understood that the configuration of network 510 permits addition of new modules and subtraction of existing modules without requiring manual reconfiguration of the existing modules. When a new module is added, network 510 recognizes the module and facilitates communications between the added module and the existing modules automatically. Additionally, it should be noted that network 510 is implemented to operate as a masterless system, wherein each module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 operates substantially autonomously. One feature of network 510 is the periodic transmission of each module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 of a \u201cheartbeat\u201d message or status message to the bus for receipt by each of the remaining modules. In this manner, control system 44 periodically verifies the functionality of each module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 in system 44, and is able to identify a non-operational module by the absence of the module's \u201cheartbeat\u201d message. As further described herein, communications by and among modules 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 are initiated by the individual modules on an event-driven basis.",
        "Power for control system 44 is supplied through power supply module 514. More specifically, AC plug 45 of a power cord (not shown) secured to frame 12 is inserted into a conventional wall outlet supplying 100 VAC, 120 VAC, or 230 VAC power. Power conditioning circuitry 556 converts the AC input power to DC levels for use by the various electronic components of control system 44. Power supply module 514 further facilitates limited functionality of patient support 10 via battery 46 when AC plug 45 is not connected to a wall outlet. Battery 46 is automatically charged by battery charger 552, which provides a status signal to power supply module 514 to indicate the condition of the charge of battery 46. In one embodiment, battery charger 552 permits use of battery 46 as a back-up power source that allows logic module 512 to perform (for 24 hours after AC power has been disconnected) a single operation of high-low up/down, head up/down, tilt/reverse tilt, foot retract/extend, Trendelenburg, and chair out. When AC power is applied to patient support 10, a light emitting diode (LED) 737 (FIG. 31) indicates the status of battery 46. For example, the LED remains lit when battery 46 has sufficient power, blinks when battery 46 power is low, or is off when battery 46 has lost all power or is disconnected. As indicated, power supply module 514 controls the operation of pneumatic pump 64 (or a blower or other type of inflating means), which supplies air to mattress 14 (as described in greater detail below).",
        "Power supply module 514 also receives the signal provided by obstacle detection device 58 as described herein. Power supply module outputs a message on network 510 when obstacle detection device 58 outputs a signal indicating the presence of an obstacle so that appropriate action can be taken to prevent injury or damage.",
        "Power supply module 514 also controls night light 548. Specifically, night light 548, which illustratively is mounted to patient support 10 at a location to illuminate the ingress/egress area of patient support 10, is always active or on when AC power is provided to power supply module 514. Night light 548 may be disabled or shut off during battery powered operation. As further described herein, the illumination element (not shown) of night light 548 is enclosed by a housing, which also includes circuitry (not shown) to prevent flicker.",
        "As further described herein, each foot pedal 1724, 1726, 1728, 1730 of foot pedal controls 56 provides a signal when depressed. Power supply module 514 uses these signals to generate messages for transmission on network 510 indicating the status of pedals 1724, 1726, 1728, 1730. Logic module 512 processes such messages to determine whether foot pedal controls 56 are enabled, and to control the operation of DC motors 604 of linear actuators 48, as further described herein. Of course, operation of DC motors 604 is conditioned upon the actual positions of the various components of patient support 10, and upon the status of various lockout signals generated by a caregiver using siderail controllers 52, 54.",
        "Finally, power supply module 514 functions as an input location via a connector (not shown) for test device 558. Test device 558 is configured to operate as an additional module on network 510 for performing diagnostic operations on the various functions of patient support 10 as is further described herein.",
        "Scale/ppm module 516 converts the signals from load cells 220, 222, 224, 226, described above, into actual weight measured on weigh frame 32. This information is outputted for display on a scale display (not shown) and possible transmission to a hospital information network via sidecomm module 524 and remote network interface 572. Scale/ppm module 516 further receives input from bed exit sensor 562, which determines, based on the weight measured on weigh frame 32, whether a patient has exited patient support 10.",
        "Dynamic surface module 518 controls the dynamic air surface or mattress 14. It processes messages initiated by either of siderail controllers 52, 54 to operate solenoids 564 (part of valve assemblies 2406), which in turn adjust the level of inflation of mattress 14 during, for example, a turn assist procedure as further described herein. Additionally, dynamic surface module 518 receives feedback from pressure transducers 566 in the form of electrical signals that indicate pressure measurements of the various bladders of mattress 14. Dynamic surface module 518 operates solenoids 564 in response to the feedback signals from pressure transducers 566 to achieve the desired adjustments to mattress 14.",
        "Sidecomm module 524 functions essentially as an environmental and communications interface. The nurse call, lighting, and entertainment functions are controlled by sidecomm module 524 based on inputs from siderail controllers 50, 52, 54. Sidecomm module 524 outputs signals to control these functions, and communicates with the facility's communication systems via remote network interface 572. Patient support 10 includes a connector 575 (FIG. 30) that is configured to interface with the facility's communication system and entertainment system. Another connector (not shown) is provided to interface with the nurse call control 570 and lighting controls 568. As such, sidecomm module 524 controls room lights, reading lights, television, radio, and communicates with the facility's nurse call network in response to activation of a nurse call switch or button mounted to patient support 10. Through remote network interface 572, sidecomm module 524 can provide information to the facility's information network regarding the operation of patient support 10. For example, hours of use may be reported for billing or maintenance purposes. Moreover, sidecomm module 524 can function as an interactive data link between a remote location and patient support 10. For example, the facility information network may request weight information on the patient occupying patient support 10. Sidecomm module 524 can send a message on the bus identified as a weight request. The message may be processed by scale/ppm module 516, which provides a message containing the requested weight information. Sidecomm module 524 processes the message and provides the weight information to the facility's information network via remote network interface 572. Additionally, brake-not-set sensor 576 provides an input to sidecomm module 524 to indicate that the brake preventing movement of patient support 10 is not in a set position.",
        "Logic module 512 controls movement of patient support 10 and is the entry point for nearly all of the position sensors for the various components of patient support 10. As shown, logic module 512 controls the plurality of motors 604 of linear actuators 48 connected to the moveable components (e.g., the articulating deck sections 38, 40, 42, etc.) of patient support 10, as is described in detail herein. When a DC drive motor 604 is activated, a motor sensor 546 associated with the drive motor 604 provides a feedback signal to logic module from which logic module 512 can determine when to deactivate the drive motor 604. When logic module 512 processes a message requesting movement of a particular component of patient support 10, logic module 512 first reads the position of the component (via the appropriate sensor 546). If movement of the component is necessary, then logic module 512 determines whether a lockout signal has been generated from either of the first or second pair of permanent siderail controllers 52, 54. If no lockout is set, logic module 512 controls the appropriate DC drive motor 604, while monitoring the appropriate motor sensor 546, to move the component to the desired position.",
        "Controller Area Network",
        "In one illustrative embodiment, CAN specification 2.0B as specified in ISO 11898 is used for network 510. Network 510 involves three of the seven network layers defined in the ISO model: the physical layer, the data link layer and the application layer. The physical layer includes the actual cabling or wires connecting modules 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524. The physical layer further includes the hardware present on each of modules 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 for enabling operation according to the CAN specifications. As indicated above, the hardware includes a transceiver for communicating with the bus and a microcontroller with a built-in CAN controller. A suitable transceiver is a TJA1054 CAN transceiver manufactured by Philips Electronics. A suitable microcontroller is a T89C51CC01 microcontroller manufactured by Amtel. The microcontroller is connected to a crystal oscillator, such as a 20 MHz crystal.",
        "The data layer generates and receives the messages used for communications between modules 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 via the CAN protocol (described below).",
        "The application layer complies with the CANopen specification as further described below. CANopen is an open standard based on a model including communication interface and protocol software, an object dictionary, and an application program interface. The communication interface and protocol software provides a means by which a CANopen device can transmit and receive messages over network 510. The object dictionary is a collection of all of the system variable information communicated over network 510. Finally, the application program interface controls how the application software interacts with the various network parameters.",
        "The communication interface and protocol software includes a variety of services and protocols. One protocol that handles real-time transfer of data between modules is the Process Data Objects (PDO) protocol. Two PDO services are provided: receive (RPDO) and transmit (TPDO). RPDOs are used to obtain updated information for the object dictionary entries of a module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524. TPDOs, on the other hand, are used to transmit updated information to object dictionary entries of another module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524. According to one embodiment of the invention, eight PDOs can be used for each module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 (four configured as RPDOs and four configured as TPDOs). Each PDO can transfer up to eight bytes of information. While both PDO services share the same basic structure, TPDOs are essentially broadcast messages (any module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 could receive a TPDO), and RPDOs must be unique for each module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 that transmits. For example, power supply module 514 may send battery status information to all other modules 512, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 using a single TPDO. Each module 512, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 that needs to use the information must have a corresponding RPDO to receive the information from power supply module 514. Moreover, each module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 that needs information from any other module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 must have a separate RPDO for the other module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524. In other words, RPDOs can only receive a message from a single module.",
        "PDOs are constructed from object dictionary entries in the manner depicted in FIG. 35. As shown, PDO 578 is capable of including eight bytes 580 of information. In this example, PDO 578 includes only five bytes 580 of information. The eight bytes 580 of information can come from any of a variety of different object dictionary entries (such as object dictionary entries 582 and 584) associated with different modules, and the entire data type for the object dictionary entry does not have to be used. Where the entire data type is not used, then the number of bits specified (starting with the LSB) are used as shown in FIG. 35.",
        "PDOs of control system 44 are event driven. When an object dictionary entry changes, for example, because a system variable changed, the corresponding PDO is automatically transmitted, and the object dictionary entry is automatically updated when a message is received. As explained herein, modules 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 determine which messages to process by analyzing an identifier included in the message. The identifier includes three digits in the form of x8y where x is the TPDO of the transmitting module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 and y is the module ID of the transmitting module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524. Thus, if a module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 maps one of its RPDOs with the CAN identifier 584, it correlates to TPDO2 from module 4.",
        "Another protocol is the Service Data Objects (SDO) protocol, which is administered only by a master module. As indicated herein, control system 44 includes a master only when test device 558 is coupled to power supply module 514. In that case, SDOs allow test device 558 access to any object dictionary entry present in the other modules 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524.",
        "The object dictionary defines data types, communication objects, and application objects used on network 510. The object dictionary is essentially a group of objects that are accessible via network 510 in a predefined, ordered fashion, using either SDOs or PDOs. All entries in a object dictionary use a \u201cwxyz\u201d format where w is 2 if used by a PDO, 3 if used by an SDO, x is the module identifier for the transmitting module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, y is 0 if the entry includes error information, 1 if it includes status information, and 8 if it includes control information, and z is a unique value for multiple wxy entries. For example, an object dictionary entry of 2110 indicates that the information is communicated between modules 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 during normal operation (i.e., using a PDO as opposed to an SDO used only during testing and diagnostics), that module number 1 is the transmitter of the information (e.g., scale/ppm module 516), and that it includes status information. The 0 indicates the unique value for multiple wxy entries.",
        "Although in a typical CANopen implementation nodes only have object dictionary entries to information generated or received by the node, in control system 44, all PDO object dictionary entries (2xyz) are implemented in every module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 to minimize the variance in software among modules 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524. SDO entries (3xyz), however, are unique for each module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 as a result of the application specific nature of built in self test (BIST) data objects.",
        "Messages of the type mentioned above are transmitted and received using message frames, such as the message frame 586 shown in FIG. 37. The structure of the message frames is a function of software executed by each module and configured for operation with various 8-bit 8051 family microprocessors. As already indicated, in one embodiment the software conforms to CANopen protocol for the application layer of network 510. As shown in FIG. 36, frame 586 includes seven different bit fields including start of frame (SOF) field 588, arbitration field 590, control field 592, data field 594, CRC field 596, acknowledge field 597, and end of frame (EOF) field 598. SOF field 588 indicates the beginning of message frame 586. Arbitration field 590 includes an 11-bit base identifier, and an 18-bit identifier extension. Together, these identifiers provide the message identifier introduced above. The identifier also determines the priority of the message for use in resolving bus access competition between or among modules 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 according to a non-destructive, contention-based arbitration scheme. This scheme, as is well-known in the art, ensures that messages are sent in order of priority, and that the content of each message is preserved. Arbitration field 590 further includes a substitute remote request bit that is transmitted as a recessive bit and used to resolve priority conflicts between different frame formats. Control field 592 includes six bits: two reserved bits (r0 and r1) and a four bit data length code (DLC) indicating the number of bytes in data field 594 that follows. Data field 594 may contain up to eight bytes of data. CRC field 596 includes a 15-bit cyclical redundancy check code and a recessive delimiter bit. Acknowledge field 597 includes two bits: a slot bit which is transmitted as recessive but is subsequently over written by dominant bits transmitted from any module 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524 that receives the transmitted message, and a recessive delimiter bit. Finally, EOF field 598 consists of seven recessive bits. After each message frame 586, an intermission field 599 is provided that includes three recessive bits. Thereafter, the bus is considered idle.",

For example, memory 616 includes volatile (e.g., flash memory, RAM) and non-volatile (e.g., on-chip EEPROM) memory for storing computer programming code and data required by control system 601. In the illustrated embodiment, on-chip EEPROM memory is used for long term data storage while flash based memory is used for storage of computer programming code and RAM memory is used for short term data storage, however, it is understood that other suitable memory configurations would work equally as well.",

        "End of Travel Control System",
        "In an illustrative embodiment, linear actuators 48 including DC drive motors 604 are used to drive the movement of head, seat, and leg sections 38, 40, 42 of patient support surface 10. In general, actuators 48 are activated by activation by a caregiver or patient of one or more of the control buttons illustratively located on controllers 50, 52, 54 (e.g., buttons 1520, 1522 on detachable siderail controller 50; buttons 1550, 1551, 1564, 1566, 1574 on first siderail controllers 52; buttons 1628, 1624, 1626 on controllers 54) or one or more of the pedals of the foot pedal controls 56. As common with most linear actuators, failure of any of actuators 48 may occur if a drive or rod reaches its mechanical end of travel, for example, due to a heavy load on the actuator.",
        "It is known to provide an actuator with an electrical end of travel that is defined to occur earlier than the mechanical end of travel to prevent the actuator from reaching its mechanical end of travel. Using the electrical end of travel, a loss of current occurs when the driving component, such as a piston rod moves past the electrical end of travel. Many existing drives operate until the electrical end of travel is reached. However, in patient support surfaces such as hospital beds, reaching even the electrical end of travel may cause the drive to bounce back and forth due to hysteresis of the drive mechanism. Such oscillatory motion or bouncing may present a safety concern, particularly in drives used to raise and lower the head section of the patient support surface and in drives that power the hi/lo mechanism.",
        "To prevent the above-described oscillatory motion or bouncing in patient support 10, some or all of linear actuators 48 are coupled to a closed loop end of travel control system 626, which establishes a new end of travel setting and thus prevents the actuator from reaching either the electrical or mechanical end of travel during articulation of a section of patient support 10. In the illustrated embodiment, at least head section actuator 48c and deck actuators 48a, 48b are coupled to control system 626.",
        "Another application of end of travel control system 626 relates to the CPR function of the illustrative embodiment patient support 10. As described above, when CPR handle 352 is activated by a caregiver or operator of patient support 10, head section 38 is mechanically lowered. Also, the actuator 48d for seat section 40 is automatically activated as needed to lower seat section 40 and the actuator 48e for leg section 42 is automatically activated as needed to raise leg section 42, to put patient support 10 into the horizontal position shown in FIG. 3. End of travel control system 626 operates to detect when head section 38, seat section 40 and leg section 42 have reached their respective bottom or zero positions, shown in FIG. 3. Upon detection of the bottom position of head, seat and leg sections 38, 40,42, a timer is started. If the caregiver/operator continues to keep CPR handle 352 activated for a predefined period of time, patient support 10 is automatically moved into the emergency Trendelenburg position shown in FIG. 9. If CPR handle 352 is released before the predefined wait period expires, patient support 10 does not continue into the emergency Trendelenburg position. In this way, a \u201csingle action\u201d CPR handle for moving patient support 10 into the CPR and emergency Trendelenburg positions is provided.",
        "Closed loop end of travel control system 626 of the illustrative embodiment is provided in addition to any other electrical and mechanical end of travel systems. However, it is understood that in other embodiments, closed loop end of travel control system 626 may be provided in lieu of traditional end of travel systems.",
        "Linear actuators 48a, 48b, 48c, 48d, 48e, 48f are shown, for example, in FIGS. 7 and 18. Each actuator 48 includes DC drive motor 604 that powers linear movement of respective piston rod 172, as is well known in the art. In FIG. 38, it is shown that as drive motor 604 moves piston rod 172 including load connector 628 in the direction of arrow 629, it approaches a mechanical end of travel. The closed loop end of travel control system 626 includes a built-in feedback mechanism that continuously monitors the actual position 630 of piston rod 172 and compares the actual position 630 to a new predetermined end of travel limit 632. The new end of travel limit 632 is set to occur earlier than either the electrical end of travel 634 or the mechanical end of travel 636 of the actuator 48, so that it will be reached before either the electrical or mechanical end of travel 634, 636. Movement of the rod 172 is limited to the predetermined end of travel limit setting 632 to prevent oscillating or bouncing and to prevent rod 172 from reaching mechanical end of travel 636.",
        "In the illustrated embodiment, position detector 606 is a potentiometer located inside the housing of drive motor 604, however, it is understood that other means for detecting position, such as a tachometer, may be used. For actuators 48 that are provided with end of travel control system 626, potentiometer 606 has a predetermined setting approximately equal to new end of travel limit 632. Calculation of new end of travel limit 632 is discussed below. Position detector 606 measures the current position 630 of rod 172 and compares it to new end of travel limit 632. If the actual position 630 reaches new end of travel limit 632, an error message or message indicating that the limit has been reached is sent to microcontroller 614, and subsequent actions are taken as described below.",

Each time drive motor 604 starts, whether to perform an up or down/forward or backward motion, timer 625a is started. When drive motor 604 stops, timer 625a stops. Position information 630, 632, 634, 636 and time of occurrence information are stored in memory 616.",
        "FIG. 40 shows steps performed in the method of operation of end of travel control system 626 when a drive motor 604 is operating. Beginning at step 646, a current position 630 of the drive rod 172 during its operation is determined. For each actuator 48, the process associated with control system 626 identifies a known \u201cinitial\u201d position of the drive rod 172. In the illustrated embodiment, the initial position of the drive rod 172 is the unextended position, but it is understood that any drive position could be designated as the initial position. The initial position may be different for each drive actuator 48. The initial position for each actuator 48 is obtained by measuring the voltage across potentiometer 606 in a voltage divider circuit and converting the measured value to digital form using A/D converter 620. The potentiometer 606 reading is representative of the movement of the drive shaft or rod 172 of drive motor 604.",
        "Based on the potentiometer 606 reading at the initial position of each drive rod 172 and the total stroke length of the drive rod 172 (typically provided by the drive manufacturer), a correlation can be made between the potentiometer 606 reading and the stroke length (e.g., with stroke length illustratively measured in millimeters). In this way, current position 630 of drive rod 172 during its travel is determined by comparing the current potentiometer 606 reading to a table of known potentiometer readings and the corresponding stroke length for drive rod 172.",
        "Typically, actual position 630 is measured on a recurring basis over predefined time intervals, such as every 20 milliseconds, as counted by timer 625a. In other embodiments, the time that position 630 is measured is also captured. In the illustrative embodiment, if rod 172 is traveling upward, the last position captured before current position 630 is kept in memory and used as detailed below. It is understood that the last position could be tracked during upward, downward, forward, and/or backward movement as needed. The last position, and current position 630, along with sample times associated with each of the last position and current position 630, are converted to digital form by A/D converter 620 and stored in memory 616.",
        "At step 648, new end of travel limit 632 is determined in the manner described above, e.g., based on the potentiometer 606 value when the rod 172 is in the extended position. For example, in one embodiment, a look-up table stored in memory 616 is used. In another embodiment, limit 632 is calculated based on the anticipated amount of hysteresis of actuator 48. The anticipated amount of hysteresis can be estimated as a percentage of the total stroke length of drive rod 172. In the illustrative embodiment, the amount of hysteresis is estimated as about 1% or less of the total stroke length, however, it is understood that other suitable methods for calculating anticipated hysteresis may be used, depending on the particular type or model of drive actuator 48 being used and/or its particular application. New limit 632 is determined, for example, by adjusting electrical end of travel limit 634 by the anticipated amount of hysteresis, so that new limit 632 occurs earlier than electrical limit 634. New limit 632 may also be based on the height of patient support 10 and/or the angle of head section 38 and/or system level noise. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, new limit 632 is calculated assuming a bed height of approximately 36 centimeters and 65-75 degrees of head angle. It is understood that the values obtained for limits 632 and 634, stroke length, and estimated amount of hysteresis are stored in memory 616 as needed to perform the above-described calculations.",
        "At step 650, the change in position of rod 172 is analyzed. Current position 630 is compared to limit 632 using computer programming logic. In additional embodiments, a rate of change of position of rod 172, is determined by comparing the time of measurement of current position 630 to the previously measured current position and its time of measurement.",
        "It is understood by those skilled in the art that the rate of change of position of rod 172 is determined based on the position readings of potentiometer 606 and is also affected by the drive's spindle pitch. Speed and pitch data for the drive are generally provided by the manufacturer.",
        "The rate of change of position is monitored, for example, to determine whether the drive is overloaded or whether something is interfering with the portion of the bed being moved by the drive. For instance, if a patient is attempting to raise the head end of the bed, but does not realize that the frame is caught on something, such as a window sill, the rate of change of position analysis will indicate that though the drive is running, the position has not changed as normal. As a result, an error code is generated and the motor shuts down to avoid further damage to the system or harm to the patient.",
        "At decision step 652, actual position 630 is compared to limit 632. Additionally, the rate of change of position is compared to a predetermined rate of change position limit 653 stored in memory 616. If the actual position 630 of rod 172 has not reached limit 632, or if the actual rate of change of position has not reached the rate of change of position limit 663, then the process returns to step 646.",
        "The illustrated embodiments are particularly concerned with monitoring upper position and rate of change of position limits, however, it is understood that in alternative or addition, lower limits may also be defined and controlled in similar fashion.",
        "If actual position 630 has reached or exceeded limit 632, or if the actual rate of change of position has reached or exceeded the rate of change of position limit 653, then at step 664 potentiometer 606 sends a fault condition or \u201climit reached\u201d signal to microcontroller 614.",
        "At step 656, microcontroller 614 handles the fault or limit reached condition. In certain embodiments, if position limit 632 is reached or exceeded, or if the rate of change of position limit 661 is reached or exceeded, microcontroller 614 recovers from the error condition by initiating application code, e.g., via a software process or internal or external reset, which resets position 632 to a zero or home position and requests actuator 48 to begin motion in the opposite direction. For instance, if limit 632 is reached during downward travel, position 632 is reset to zero and a signal to begin travel in the upward direction is issued. The process would occur in reverse, if the actuator 48 was moving in the opposite direction.",
        "In other embodiments, at step 656, if position limit 632 is reached or exceeded, or if the rate of change of position limit 663 is reached or exceeded, microcontroller 614 places patient support 10 in a safe/error state that minimizes hazards to patients, caregivers, associated individuals, equipment, and/or data. For instance, microcontroller 614 may initiate a reset or signal power source 612 to interrupt, disengage, or reduce current supplied to actuator 48.",
        "At step 656, microcontroller 614 may also set a flag to indicate to an operator that service is necessary on the affected actuator 48 or on the entire drive system. Such indication may be communicated to an operator by illuminating, blinking or flashing one or more LEDs located on one of controllers 50, 52, 54, or other suitable location on patient support 10. Different colored LEDs may be used to signal different types of errors. In the illustrated embodiment, red, green, and amber colored LEDs are used. For example, if the position 630 of actuator 48c of head section 38 has exceeded limit 634, red and green LEDs may be set to blinking while an amber LED remains off. However, it is understood that any suitable combination of colors and LED activity may be used to indicate the various possible error types. Further, other conventional alarm devices may be utilized such as audible buzzers or bells.",
        "As discussed above, the rate of change of position is monitored to detect whether the drive actuator 48 is overloaded or when an interference condition exists, for example, if drive motor 604 is powered on to raise a deck section 38, 40, 42, but something, such as a window sill, piece of equipment, or utility cart, interferes with its movement or there is excessive weight on the deck section. The rate of change of position is determined using a potentiometer 660 or by other suitable means known in the art. In the illustrated embodiment, potentiometer 606 is used to determine the rate of change of position by measuring the rate of change of the position of drive rod 172 over time. If the rate of position change is too high or too low, an overload or interference condition is detected. In the illustrated embodiment, \u201ctoo high\u201d or \u201ctoo low\u201d means that the rate of position change is at least approximately 200% above or below the normal operating rate of change of position of drive 48 when actuated by a user (i.e., the normal rate when an \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d button is pressed to raise or lower a bed section). If an overload or interference condition is detected, based on comparison of rate of change of position to rate of change of position limit 653, an error code will be generated at step 654 and the error condition will be handled at step 656 as described above.",
        "Duty Cycle Protection",
        "For safety and warranty reasons, linear actuator drive manufacturers typically set a maximum run time for their actuators. Typically, the maximum run time is specified in terms of minutes per hour, e.g., 6 minutes per hour. In view of the safety concerns of the medical environment, a reliable mechanism is needed to detect in a preventative way when an actuator's run time is approaching the predefined run time limit to prevent thermal overload of the actuators, protect against overuse of the actuators, and prolong the life of the actuators. Thus, in certain illustrative embodiments of the present invention, logic module 512 of control system 44 includes a closed loop control circuit 660 that monitors both current and drive run time. Duty cycle protection circuit 660 measures the actual run time of an actuator 48 and then prevents drive operation if a maximum run time 662 is exceeded, as described below. Circuit 660 is designed to prevent thermal protection circuit 670 (described below) from experiencing a fault condition.",
        "FIG. 40 shows an illustrative embodiment method of operation of duty cycle protection circuit 660. At step 688, system 660 detects whether one or more actuator motors 604 are running, e.g., by detecting a signal from a motor sensor 546 or detecting that a signal to start one or more of actuators 48 has been received. In the illustrated embodiment, this occurs when any of the articulation control buttons (e.g., head up buttons 1551, 1520, head down buttons 1550, 1522, tilt button 1564, reverse tilt button 1566, etc.) of controllers 50, 52, 54 are activated (i.e., pressed by a patient or caregiver). Also, in the illustrated embodiment, articulation of a bed section will typically occur in response to activation of a control button for as long as the control button remains activated (until the travel limit is reached). If the patient or caregiver releases pressure from the control button, articulation will stop until the same button is pressed again, or another articulation button is activated. In alternative embodiments, a single press of an articulation button activates the articulation function, and a second press deactivates the articulation function.",
        "If an articulation signal has been received, process 660 proceeds to step 690. At step 690, microcontroller 614 determines which actuators 48a, 48b, 48c, 48d, 48e, 48f have been activated, e.g., by reference to the correspondingly activated control button and the associated articulation function. For example, if head up button 1551 is activated, then head section actuator 48c is actuated. The maximum run time 662 is determined for the activated actuators 48 and stored in memory 616. The maximum run time may 662 vary depending on the particular actuator model used and/or its particular application. As mentioned above, the maximum run time 662 is typically defined by the manufacturer of the actuator. For example, for linear actuator model LA28, made by Linak A/S, the maximum run time is currently stated as 10% or 6 minutes per hour at continuous use. In the illustrative embodiment, the duty cycles of actuators 48 range from 20% to 80%, however, it is understood that the duty cycle for a suitable actuator may fall outside this range. Further, it is understood that other methods of determining maximum run time may be used, for example, depending upon the particular function to which actuator 48 is assigned.",
        "At step 692, an application timer 625b for circuit 660 is started, in order to keep track of how long motor(s) 604 of activated actuator(s) 48 are running. At step 694, the actual current 668 is measured using an ammeter or other suitable means known in the art. Run time 666 is tracked by timer 625b.",
        "At step 696, measured current 668 and run time 666 are analyzed by microcontroller 614. In the illustrated embodiment, run time 666 is evaluated by using an analysis of the rate of heat transfer in drive motor 604. It is known that as current increases, temperature increases, and that the rate of heat transfer is a function of conductivity and temperature gradient. Thus, the rate of heat transfer can be assessed based on the change in current 668 over time.",
        "Before drive motor 604 has started running, e.g., when patient support 10 is first plugged in, run time 666 (e.g., the count of timer 625b) is initialized or set to zero. While drive motor 604 is running, timer 625b is incremented by a predefined amount which is based on the measured current 668. If current 668 is high, timer 625b will be incremented by a greater amount, and if current 668 is low, timer 625b will be incremented by a lesser amount. In the illustrated embodiment, different time increments are specified for four different ranges of current, e.g., timer 625b is incremented by 12, 14, 16 or 18 counts based on the amount of current 668 being drawn by drive motor 604.",
        "If drive motor 604 stops running, timer 625b is decremented by a value \u201cL\u201d representative of the rate of heat transfer based on the known thermodynamics equation, q=\u2212K\u0394T, where q is the rate of heat transfer per unit area, \u0394T is the temperature gradient, and K is conductivity. The higher the level of the value of timer 625b, the greater the value \u201cL\u201d will be. In the illustrated embodiment, L is 1, 2, or 4 depending on how high timer 625b has been incremented.",
        "If drive motor 604 is disconnected from power source 612, run time 666 (e.g., the count of timer 625b) is stored in memory 616. In this way, system 660 accounts for the fact that drive motor 604 may not have been disconnected from power for a significant time.",
        "At decision step 698, if the drive run time 666 reaches or exceeds the predetermined run time threshold 662, the process proceeds to step 702. In the illustrated embodiment, this is determined by comparing the count of timer 625b (i.e., run time 666) to maximum run time 662.",
        "At step 702, a fault condition is signaled and, at step 704, the current motor function (e.g., chair head up, head down, etc.) is deactivated or turned off. Also at step 702, logic may be used to allow certain emergency functions, such as CPR, to be activated prior to turning off the current motor function. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, CPR mode can still be activated at least one time after system 660 detects a duty cycle overrun. In response to a fault condition, microcontroller 614 may place patient support 10 in a \u201csafe state\u201d that minimizes hazards to patients, caregivers, associated individuals, equipment, and data, e.g., by signaling power source 612 to interrupt, disengage, or reduce current supplied to drive motor 604 of the activated actuator 48. Microcontroller 614 may also activate an audible or visual indicator to alert an operator that service is necessary on the affected drive or on the entire system. Such indication may be communicated to an operator by, for example, illuminating, blinking or flashing one or more LEDs located on one of controllers 50, 52, 54, or other suitable location on patient support 10.",
        "At step 708, a timer 625c is started, which counts off a predefined wait period after which it is safe to restart the previously operating motor function. The wait period may be determined based on the value of run time 666 or maximum run time 662, or other criteria. For example, the wait period may be set equal to the maximum run time 662. In the illustrated embodiment, the wait period is set equal to half of the maximum run time 662.",
        "At decision step 710, microcontroller 614 determines whether the wait period has expired. Step 710 is repeated until the wait period has expired. In the illustrated embodiment, when the wait period has expired, the motor function is restarted at step 712. However, it is understood that in other illustrative embodiments, it may not be necessary or desirable to restart the motor function and thus step 712 may be eliminated in those embodiments.",
        "Returning to step 698, if run time 666 has not reached or exceeded maximum run time 662, the process proceeds to decision step 700. At step 700, system 660 determines whether drive motor 604 of the activated actuator 48 is still operating, e.g., by detecting a signal from a motor sensor 546 or by checking to see if one of the corresponding control buttons is activated. If the activated actuator 48 is still running, the process returns to step 694 to measure current 668 and run time 666. If actuator 48 is not still running, the process ends at step 706.",
        "Thermal Protection",
        "To protect DC drive motors 604 from thermal overload during use in a hospital room environment, a method 720 for detecting thermal failure of the drive motors 604 is provided. A thermal overload condition can occur if, for example, failure of the current overload, interference/obstruction detection, or duty cycle protection mechanisms described above occurs. The presently described method 720 is adapted to the specific safety risks of a medical environment. An embodiment of the method is shown in FIG. 42.",
        "At step 722, a maximum temperature 723 is determined for a drive motor 604 of a selected actuator 48. Maximum temperature 723 is typically determined by reference to the manufacturer's specifications for the particular actuator 48. However, it is understood that other means for determining maximum temperature 723, including experimentation, for example, under particular environmental conditions, may be used. Maximum temperature 723 is stored in memory 616.",
        "Typically, activation of a selected actuator 48 occurs when a patient or caregiver selects the corresponding actuator control button on controller 50, 52, or 54, as described above. During operation of the selected actuator 48, a current temperature 724 of the drive 604 is measured inside the housing of drive motor 604, at step 726. Any suitable thermal sensing element, such as a conventional thermocouple, may be used to measure temperature 724. An application timer 625d is used to periodically sample temperature 724 during operation of actuator 48 as long as the drive is in operation and maximum temperature 723 has not been exceeded. Temperature 724 is converted to digital form by A/D converter 620 and is stored in memory 616.",
        "At step 728, the temperature of drive motor 604 is analyzed. Current temperature 724 is compared to maximum temperature 723. At decision step 730, microcontroller 614 determines whether operation of actuator 48 should continue in view of current temperature 724. If current temperature 724 reaches or exceeds maximum temperature 723, the process 720 continues to step 732, where an error signal is generated. If current temperature 724 is less than maximum temperature 723, the process 720 returns to step 726.",
        "At step 732, a fault condition is signaled and, at step 734, microcontroller 614 places patient support 10 in a safe state that minimizes hazards to patients, caregivers, associated individuals, equipment, and data, e.g., by signaling power source 612 to interrupt, disengage, or reduce current supplied to drive motor 604 of the activated actuator 48. Microcontroller 614 may also set a flag to indicate to an operator that service is necessary on the affected drive or on the entire system. Such indication may be communicated to an operator by illuminating, blinking or flashing one or more LEDs located on one of controllers 50, 52, 54, or other suitable location on patient support 10. In the illustrated embodiment, if measured temperature 724 exceeds maximum temperature 723, thermal failure is assumed and the drive 604 is automatically shut down. Typically, a bimetallic thermal switch located inside the motor housing opens to interrupt the current supply to drive 604.",
        "Patient support surfaces, such as hospital beds, often include many features that are electrically powered. Such features include bed articulation controls that allow the various deck sections of the bed to be raised or lowered so that the bed can support patients in a number of different positions. There is a need for at least some of these bed controls to remain available when the bed's primary source of power is lost, i.e., due to a power outage, or while a patient is being transported from one hospital room to another.",
        "Battery Backup System",
        "As a result of government regulations that, for example, require hospital beds to be able to assume the emergency Trendelenburg position whether or not AC power is available, and for other reasons, existing hospital beds may include a battery backup system that powers the bed functions when AC power is not available. However, because hospital beds often require a substantial amount of power to operate the various features, a method to conserve battery power while maintaining compliance with existing regulations is desired.",
        "As best shown in FIG. 31, frame 12 supports a battery enable switch 736. Battery enable switch 736 is a normally open contact, momentary function switch. In the illustrated embodiment, battery enable switch 736 is located on the portion of base frame 28 that is substantially underneath head section 38 of deck 26, however, it is understood that battery enable switch 706 could be located anywhere on base frame 28 or other area of patient support 10 as necessary or convenient. Battery enable switch 736 is electrically coupled to a battery 46, shown in FIGS. 2 and 31.",
        "Battery enable switch 736 allows a person, such as a health care provider, to operate electrically-controlled bed functions (such as bed articulation functions) of patient support 10 using a backup power source (in the illustrated embodiment, battery system 46) when the primary power source 738 (e.g., AC power coupled to bed 10 by plug connection 45) is not available. Such instances may occur, for example, when a power outage occurs or when a bed 10 is being moved from one area of a hospital to another.",
        "As shown in FIG. 31, battery enable switch 736 is a momentary switch, such as a push button. Switch 736 includes a light-emitting diode (LED) 737 or other suitable illuminating means known in the art, enclosed in or covered by a translucent or transparent housing made of plastic or other suitable material. The LED 737 is illuminated when either primary power source 738 is coupled to bed 10 through plug connection 45, or backup power or battery 46 is charged and supplying power to bed functions of patient support 10. When patient support 10 is disconnected from primary power source 738, or if backup power source 46 is discharged, the LED 737 is not illuminated. If primary power source 738 is disconnected and backup power source 46 is in need of power or is recharging, the LED 737 blinks or flashes intermittently on and off.",
        "Circuitry for controlling the activation of backup power source 46 is included in control system 44. As illustrated in FIG. 43, primary power source 738 is connected to switching regulator 740 through diode 742 and connection 744. Backup power source 46 is connected to switching regulator 740 via connection 746, contact 748 of relay 750, diode 752 and connection 744. Switching regulator 740 provides power to at least the electrically-controlled bed functions that are required or desired to operate under backup power, such as bed articulation functions.",

When primary power source 738 is operating, voltage is applied to switching regulator 740 through connection 744 and to microprocessor 756 through connection 758. When voltage is not present on connection 758, microprocessor 756 senses the lack of primary power and closes contact 748 of relay 750 by energizing coil 754. Closing relay contact 748 provides sufficient backup power to the bed for a predetermined amount of time to allow an orderly shutdown of the bed functions. After the predetermined period of time expires, microprocessor 756 opens relay contact 748 to remove logic power from the bed functions and put patient support 10 into sleep mode.",
        "When patient support 10 is in sleep mode, activation of battery enable switch 736, e.g., by momentarily pressing switch 736, causes patient support 10 to switch out of sleep mode. Activating switch 736 while primary power source 738 is operating has no effect.",
        "In the illustrated embodiment, battery enable switch 736 is activated by the application of pressure on the housing, i.e., by depressing switch 736 with one's finger. In other embodiments, activating any one of the bed function control buttons located on controllers 50, 52, 54 while patient support 736 is in sleep mode will also switch it out of sleep mode.",
        "When switch 736 is activated, sufficient power is provided from backup power source 46 so that at least certain required electrically operational functions of patient support 10, such as articulation of patient support 10, can be performed. In the illustrated embodiment, activation of switch 736 selectively powers certain bed functions, including the bed articulation functions, while other features, such as scale/ppm module 516 and dynamic surface module 518, are not powered by backup power source 46 in order to conserve power. Also, power is always provided to nurse call control 570, even when backup source 46 is in sleep mode. It is understood however, that control system 44 may be configured so that any particular combination of electrically-controlled features of patient support surface 10 (including scale/ppm module 516 and/or dynamic surface module 518) may be powered by backup power source 46.",
        "When microprocessor 756 detects that no power is being supplied by primary power source 738, pressing switch 736 causes microprocessor 714 to apply voltage from backup power source 46 to energize relay coil 754 and close relay contact 748. Closing relay contact 748 again provides logic power to bed functions via switching regulator 740 and Vcc power to microprocessor 756. When microprocessor 756 receives power Vcc, it activates a transistor 760 through connection 762. Microprocessor 756 includes a timer and holds transistor 760 in an on or activated state for a predetermined period of time, as further explained below. When the predetermined period of time expires, microprocessor 756 turns off or deactivates transistor 760. Turning off transistor 760 shuts off logic power to the bed electronics, thus saving battery power.",

At step 782, when backup power 46 is activated, microprocessor 756 sets the timer to count until one of the following occurs: a bed function control button is depressed, battery enable switch 736 is depressed, or a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 5 minutes) elapses. It is understood that in different embodiments, less than all of these conditions may be tested. For example, in one embodiment, pressing battery enable switch 736 may not interrupt the timer.",
        "At step 784, microprocessor 756 determines whether the preset amount of time has elapsed. If the predefined time period has elapsed, the process returns to step 772, where the bed functions are put into sleep mode. If the time period has not elapsed, microprocessor 756 checks to see if another key (e.g., a bed function-activating key or the battery enable switch) has been pressed, at step 786. If no key has been pressed, the timer continues counting until the predetermined time period expires, at step 784.",
        "If another key has been pressed, as determined at step 786, then the timer is reset at step 788. The process then returns to step 780 and backup power source 46 is reactivated or awakened out of sleep mode.",
        "In this manner, backup power is conserved and, in embodiments where a battery 46 is used to support backup power system, a smaller battery can be used. At the same time, battery enable switch 736 permits patient support 10 to meet the above-mentioned regulatory requirements by enabling at least a portion of the bed's articulation features to be operable on backup power when needed.",

Because slide member 1168 is biased in direction 1196, pins 1172 are biased outwardly into apertures 1176 in respective flanges 1130, 1164 of respective first links 1118, 1160. When pins 1172 are positioned in apertures 1176 of respective first links 1118, 1160, respective fourth links 1124 are coupled together at two axially spaced apart locations. This prevents rotation of respective linkage assemblies 1114, 1116 to prevent siderails 20, 22 from swinging to the lower position.",
        "To unbind linkage respective assemblies 1114, 1116 and permit respective siderails 20, 22 to swing to the down position, pins 1172 must be moved from the latched position (FIGS. 52 and 54) to the unlatched position (FIGS. 53 and 55). A caregiver can unlatch pins 1172 by pulling upwardly on handle portion 1180 of slide member 1168 in direction 1198. This movement causes rocker arms 1170 to rotate about boss 1182 and pulls pins 1172 inwardly out of apertures 1176 of respective first links 1118, 1160 of linkage assemblies 1114, 1116 so that pins 1172 no longer binds respective first links 1118, 1160 and respective fourth links 1124.",
        "Because respective first links 1118, 1160 and respective fourth links 1124 are free to pivot relative to one another, respective linkage assemblies 1114, 1116 are also unbound and free to permit siderails 20, 22 to swing between the upper and lower positions.

Pedal housing 1662 includes an L-shaped body portion 1664 that couples to base frame 28 and a housing portion 1666 that defines an enclosed space 1668.",
        "Because housing portion 1666 is centrally located and raised relative to foot pedals 1660, it acts as a locator for pedals 1660. For example, a caregiver who is familiar with patient support 10 will be able to sweep their foot over pedals 1660 until striking either side of housing portion 1666. Because of their familiarity with patient support 10, they will recognize which pedal 1660 is located beneath their foot. If this pedal 1660 performs the desired function, the need only step down without looking down at the respective pedal 1660 for an decal or indicator that indicates the specific function of that respective pedal 1660. If the desired pedal 1660 is not the one located under their foot, they will recognize that they need to back away from housing portion 1666 to the next adjacent foot pedal 1660 that does perform the desired function. Preferably, the caregiver will initially sweep toward the correct side of housing portion 1666 on which the desired foot pedal 1660 is located.",

Pedal portion 1670 extends beyond pedal housing 1662 to permit a caregiver to press down on pedal portion 1670 as shown in FIG. 76. When in the first raised position, a top surface 1676 of pedal portion 1670 is about 6 inches above the floor 29 so that 5.5 inches of clearance 1677 exists under pedal portion 1670. Furthermore, this spacing permits a caregiver or other person to operate pedals 1660 while his or her heal 1680 rests on floor 29. Because the caregiver's heal 1680 is on the ground 29 during the movement of patient support 10, his or her foot is further away from the moving components of the patient support. Preferably, decals or indicators (not shown) are provided on inward portions 1682 of top surface 1676 that is at an angle of 45 degrees from horizontal to help a caregiver's line of sight in viewing the decal or indicator that indicates what function of patient support 10 is controlled by the particular pedal 1660.",

If any of pedals 1660 are lowered within the twenty second window, the function is performed and the window is reset for another twenty seconds. If twenty seconds go by without any of the pedals 1660 being moved back down to the second lowered position, pedals 1660 are again disabled. If two pedals 1660 are simultaneously moved to the second lowered position, neither function is performed. Preferably, pedals 1660 travel through an angle of 50 degrees from the first raised position to the second lowered position.",

Sensor 538 detects the change in position of magnet 1710 during movement of the respective pedal 1660 by detecting the change in magnetic field. Based on this change in magnetic field, sensor 538 sends a signal indicative of the first raised and second lowered positions of the respective pedal 1660 to the control system 44. Control system 44 then initiates the application of power to actuators 48 to control and power the function of the respective components of patient support 10.",

The preferred embodiment dome switch sensor is a Cannon SD 350 Dome Switch that requires 2.25 N operating forces and is sold by Cannon, ITT Industries.",
        "Another such alternative embodiment sensor 1750 is shown in FIGS. 89-91. Sensor 1750 is preferably a force sensing resistor having its contacts with a cable 1752 embedded in a resilient material 1754, such as potting material, that provides a water proof cover to the contact. Pedals 1660\u2032 are provided with rubber plunger 1738 that presses down on sensor 1750 and creates force on sensor 1750. When force is applied to sensor 1750, the overall electrical resistance of sensor 1750 changes. This change is resistance is monitored by the control system 44. When the resistance reaches a predetermined value, control system 44 detects that the respective pedal 1660\u2032 is in the second lowered position. When the respective pedal 1660\u2032 is released, the resistance returns to its normal value and control system 44 recognizes that the respective pedal 1660\u2032 has moved away from the second lowered position. Preferably, enough force is required that accidental lowering of the respective foot pedal 1660\u2032 will not change the resistance to the predetermined value. Furthermore, this force will preferably be greater that what a typical child can generate to avoid activation by children. According to an alternative embodiment, once the predetermined resistance is reached, the speed at which the function operates is controlled by the amount of force applied to the pedal 1660\u2032 which controls the amount of resistance of the sensor 1750 above the predetermined value. For example, if the force applied creates a resistance just above or at the predetermined value, the function, such as lowering the patient support 10, will occur slowly. However, if more force is applied and the resistance is increased above the predetermined value, the speed of the patient support lowering will increase proportionally with the amount of force applied to the pedal 1660\u2032. Thus, if a smaller force is applied, the patient support 10 will lower slowly. If a greater force is applied, the patient support 10 will lower faster. If an even greater force is applied, the patient support 10 will lower even faster. Preferably, the function will have a maximum speed that cannot be exceeded regardless of the amount of force applied.",

        "In response to the obstacle detection signal from either of sensors 1802 or 1804, control system 44 will prevent the lowering of the intermediate frame 32 relative to the base frame 28. Moreover, the obstacle detection signal indicates that either an obstacle is supported on the base frame 28 or that at least one of the sensors 1802 or 1804 is not operating properly and is in a fault condition. As such, in order to avoid potential damaging impact with the detected obstacle, control system 44 prevents actuators 48a and 48b from operating to lower the intermediate frame 32. In an illustrative embodiment, control system 44 permits continued operation of the actuators 48a and 48b to raise the intermediate frame 32. Further, upon receiving the obstacle detection signal, control system 44 may instruct the actuators 48a and 48b to raise the intermediate frame 32 for a predetermined time period, illustratively 2 seconds, while preventing operation of the actuators 48a and 48b to lower the intermediate frame 32. Raising the intermediate frame 32 for a time period after an obstacle has been detected, provides for the immediate and automatic movement of the frame 32 in a direction away from the detected obstacle.",
        "While the sensors 1802 and 1804 of the obstacle detection device 58 are illustratively positioned on the base frame 28, it should be appreciated that the sensors 1802 and 1804 could likewise be positioned on a lower surface of the intermediate frame 32. Further, the obstacle detection device 58 may be utilized to detect obstacles between any two portions of a patient support 10 which move relative to each other.

More particularly, FIG. 114 illustrates a normal mode of operation with the head zone 2302 of the upper bladder assembly 2122 inflated, and the turn assist bladders 2262 and 2264 deflated. FIG. 115 illustrates a left turn assist mode of operation wherein the left turn assist bladder 2264 is inflated. Since the left turn assist bladder 2264 is laterally offset from the longitudinal center axis 2284 of the mattress 14, inflation of the bladder 2264 causes one side of the upper bladder assembly 2122 to raise above the other side. The hinges 2320 and 2322 between the side portions 2316 and 2318 and the center portion 2314 of the bladders 2306 of the upper bladder assembly 2122 permit the mattress 14 to substantially conform to the shape resulting from the inflation of the left turn assist bladder 2264. In an illustrative embodiment, upon inflation of one of the turn assist bladders 2262 and 2264, a patient supported on the mattress 14 is rotated by an angle \u03b1 of approximately 20 degrees from horizontal. Upon completion of the turn assist, the control system 44 causes the inflated turn assist bladder 2262, 2264 to vent to atmosphere. Simultaneously, the upper bladder assembly 2122 is instructed by the central system 44 to inflate to a maximum pressure. Since the turn assist bladder assembly 2120 is sandwiched intermediate the upper bladder assembly 2122 and the crowning core 2218, inflation of the upper bladder assembly 2122 facilitates the rapid venting of air within the turn assist bladders 2262 and 2264 to atmosphere.",

The fill port 2418 is in fluid communication with an accumulator port 2420 through a check valve (not shown). The check valve provides for air flow from the fill port 2418 to the accumulator port 2420 but prevents air flow in the reverse direction. The check valve therefore helps maintain pressure within the accumulator port 2420 should pressure be lost in the fill port 2418, for example, if the pump 64 would stop operating. The accumulator port 2420, in turn, is in fluid communication with the upper pilot pressure chamber 2422 of the first pilot valve 2408c.",

As such, air from the fill port 2418 may not pass to a supply port 2434 connected to the right turn assist bladder 2262 of the mattress 14. However, upon activation, the solenoid is energized such that the pin 2426 is pulled upwardly and the diaphragm 2428 moves away from the valve seat 2430. As such, a passageway represented by arrow 2436 is defined such that air may pass through the fill port 2418 over the valve seat 2430 and through the supply port 2434 to the right turn assist bladder 2262.",
        "At the same time that the normally closed valve 2408c is activated, the normally open valve 2410c is likewise activated such that the solenoid is energized to push its pin 2426 downwardly thereby causing the diaphragm 2418 to sealingly engage the valve seat 2430. As such, the supply port 2434 is sealed off from an exhaust port 2438 in fluid communication with atmosphere. In the normally open valve 2410, the spring 2432 is concentrically received within a portion of the supply port 2434 and is configured to bias against the diaphragm 2428 to push the diaphragm 2428 away from the valve seat 2430 such that the supply port 2434 is in fluid communication with the exhaust port 2438.",

Analog-to-digital converter 3002 converts the voltage to digital form and feeds the digital value to microcontroller 3004. Microcontroller 3004 analyzes the current pressure and determines whether the current pressure in controlled air zones 2262, 2264, 2302, 2304 is correct, too high, or too low in comparison to a desired pressure. Memory 3010 stores data, e.g. in the form of look-up tables, which is used in this analysis. For example, the desired pressure of an air zone 2262, 2264, 2302, 2304 may depend upon the particular operating mode of the system 3000 (e.g., pressure relief, max-inflate, CPR, right turn assist, or left turn assist), whether head section 38 is elevated and the degree of elevation, and/or the size of the patient. Tables 1, 2, and 3 show examples of desired pressures for controlled air zones 2262, 2264, 2302, 2304 based on the air system operating mode, patient size, and, for seat section 42, head section elevation.",

One embodiment of process 3030 is shown in FIG. 125 and described below.",
        "Process 3030 begins at step 3014 of FIG. 125, where the microcontroller 3004 detects whether it has been activated to determine patient size. In one illustrative embodiment, patient size button 1628 of siderail controllers 52, 54 is optional. In other embodiments, button 1628 is not optional and the operator or caregiver is required to select an appropriate patient size. In still other illustrative embodiments, button 1628 automatically selects a default setting, e.g., the \u201cmedium\u201d size, if a patient size is not selected by the operator or caregiver.",
        "In the illustrative embodiment of FIG. 125, there are three possible patient sizes that can be selected by using button 1628: \u201csmall,\u201d \u201cmedium,\u201d and \u201clarge.\u201d In general, the determination of whether a patient is of small, medium, or large size is made by the caregiver. However, it is understood that there are any number of different ways to indicate a patient's size. For example, in lieu of button 1628, pressure control system 3000 may provide the ability to automatically determine the patient's size based on the patient's weight, which may be determined by weigh frame 36 and/or by a force sensor located in seat section 40 in the manner detailed herein. Another alternative is to provide a user interface on siderail controllers 52,54 whereby the caregiver may enter the patient's height, and system 3000 determines the patient's size based on the entered height value and the patient's weight.",
        "At step 3016, the controlled air zone(s) 2262, 2264, 2302, 2304 being monitored is determined. All of head section air zone 2302, seat section air zone 2304, and turn assist bladders 2262, 2264 may be inflated to varying pressures based on patient size. However, it is understood that in alternative embodiments not all of air zones 2262, 2264, 2302, 2304 may be inflated based on patient size.",
        "At step 3018, process 3030 determines the desired inflation pressure for the respective air zone(s) 2262, 2264, 2302, 2304 being monitored based on the patient size. In the illustrated embodiment, microcontroller 3004 obtains the desired pressure for the air zone(s) 2262, 2264, 2302, 2304 from at least one look-up table stored in memory 3010. The desired pressure may be a discrete value or a range of permissible values. Also, the desired pressure may be different for each air zone 2262, 2264, 2302, 2304. Further, various other factors, including environmental factors such as temperature and/or altitude, may affect the desired pressure values and be reflected in data in the look-up table. As an example, in one embodiment, under normal hospital room conditions, for a patient considered \u201csmall,\u201d the appropriate pressure is about 4-7 inches in water for head section air zone 2302, about 7 to 21 inches in water for seat section air zone 2304, and about 18-24 inches in water for turn assist bladders 2262, 2264. Tables 1, 2, and 3 show examples of desired pressure values based upon patient size.",
        "As indicated by decision step 3020, in the illustrative embodiment of FIG. 125, the appropriate pressure for seat section air zone 2304 also depends on the elevation of head section 38. If process 3030 causes inflation of seat section air zone 2304, then at step 3022 the pressure of seat section air zone 2304 is adjusted based on the angle of head section 38. This adjustment is discussed in connection with FIG. 128 below. Thus, for seat section air zone 2304, the appropriate pressure is determined by reference to both patient size and head angle. However, adjusting the pressure of seat section air zone 2304 based on only one of these criteria is also within the scope of the present invention.",
        "At decision step 3024, microcontroller 3004 measures the current pressure as described above and determines whether the current pressure is less than, equal to, or greater than the desired pressure determined as described above. If the current pressure is less than the desired pressure at step 3026, microcontroller 3004 commands power supply 3006 to activate pump 64 to inflate air zone 2304 to the desired pressure as described above. If the current pressure is greater than the desired pressure, then at step 3028, air zone 2304 are deflated as described above.",
        "Patient Turn Assist",
        "In addition to other functions discussed above and elsewhere in this disclosure, pressure control system 3000 of dynamic surface module 518 controls the operation of turn assist bladders 2262, 2264. Turn assist bladders 2262, 2264 illustratively are bladders of mattress 14 that selectively inflate to assist a caregiver in turning or rotating a patient, e.g., for therapy or treatment reasons. One embodiment of a process 3032 for controlling operation of turn assist bladders 2262, 2264 is shown in FIGS. 126 and 127 as described below. Process 3032 is implemented using application software stored in memory 3010 of microcontroller 3004. The structure of illustrative turn assist bladders 2262, 2264 is described above.",
        "Process 3032 begins at step 3034 of FIG. 126, where microcontroller 3004 detects whether a request has been received to activate one of turn assist bladders 2262, 2264. In the illustrated embodiment, such a request is initiated by an operator or caregiver activating one of turn assist buttons 1624, 1626 located on siderail controllers 52, 54. However, it is understood that other means for activating the turn assist may be used. For example, control system 44 may be programmed to automatically activate one or more of turn assist buttons 1624, 1626 at scheduled times during the day or night.",
        "At decision step 3036, prior to initiating the turn assist function, process 3032 checks to make sure that the siderail(s) 20, 22 toward which the patient is being turned is in the up or raised position, based on signals provided by siderail position detector(s) 60. If one or more of siderails 20, 22 toward which the patient is being turned is not in the up position (i.e. in down or lowered position), an error signal is generated at step 3038 and process 3032 returns to step 3034 without activating the turn assist bladders 2262, 2264. In the illustrative embodiment, an audible or visual signal is generated for a brief period or until the siderail or siderails 20, 22 are brought to the up position. Thus, in the illustrative embodiment, the siderails 20, 22 toward which the patient is being turned must be in the up position in order for the turn assist process to initiate. It is possible, however, that in other embodiments, a caregiver or operator may override this restriction, or that this restriction may be made optional, for example, depending on the circumstances of a particular patient.",
        "At decision step 3040, microcontroller 3004 checks to see if the angle of head section 38 (head angle) is less than, equal to, or greater than a predetermined maximum angle. In the illustrated embodiment, the maximum head angle is about 40\u00b0. The head angle determination is made by logic module 512 and is discussed in connection with FIG. 128 below. Logic module 512 reports the head angle to dynamic surface module 518 for use in process 3032, via network 510. If the head angle is less than or equal to 40\u00b0, then the turn assist process continues to step 3044. However, if the head angle is greater than about 40\u00b0, an error signal is generated at step 3042, and the turn assist process returns to block 3034 without activating the turn assist bladders 2262, 2264.",
        "At step 3044, the size of the patient being supported by patient support 10 (e.g., small-medium-large) is determined as described above so that a desired pressure based on patient size is applied to the selected turn assist bladder 2262, 2264.",
        "At step 3046, if first turn assist button 1624 is activated, first turn assist bladder 2262 inflates to rotate a person in patient support 10 upwardly in a counter-clockwise from the perspective of a person standing behind head section 38. If second turn assist button 1626 is activated, second turn assist bladder 2264 inflates to rotate the person upwardly in the opposite direction as rotated in response to activation of first turn assist button 1624. Inflation of the selected turn assist bladder 2262, 2264 raises one side of the patient to a predetermined angle. In the illustrated embodiment, the selected turn assist bladder 2262, 2264 inflates to rotate the patient onto his or her side at about a 20 degree angle with respect to mattress 14, in approximately 20-50 seconds, depending on the size of the patient. It is understood that the predetermined angle and speed of inflation may be changed or modified as needed based on a variety of factors, including the purpose for rotating the patient.",
        "A timer, illustratively part of the central processing unit 3012, is set at step 3048 when the selected turn assist bladder 2262, 2264 is inflated. The selected turn assist bladder 2262, 2264 remains inflated for a predetermined period of time, for example 5-30 seconds. In the illustrated embodiment, the duration of turn assist inflation is about 5 seconds. At step 3050 the timer counts out this wait period. After the wait period is complete (e.g., after 5 seconds), an audible or visual signal is generated to indicate to the patient and caregiver that the selected turn assist bladder is about to enter a \u201cpost-turn assist\u201d phase. Process 3032 then begins deflating the selected turn assist bladder 2262, 2264 at step 3052. In the illustrated embodiment, deflation is expedited by quickly \u201chyperinflating\u201d bladders 2302, 2304 to a firm, \u201cpost-turn assist\u201d inflation pressure (see, e.g., Table 1 and Table 2). Inflation of bladders 2302, 2304 exerts pressure on turn assist bladders 2262, 2264, causing turn assist bladders 2262, 2264 to expel air more rapidly. Alternatively, a vacuum mechanism may be coupled to turn assist bladders 2262, 2264 to accelerate deflation.",
        "The post-turn assist inflation and deflation processes may be interrupted under certain circumstances. For example, when a patient's bed 10 needs a linen change, it may be desirable for first and second turn assist bladders 2262, 2264 to be activated in more rapid succession than would be possible if the full post-turn assist process were performed. In such instances, if one of turn assist buttons 1624, 1626 is activated, and then the other turn assist button 1624, 1626 is activated before the previous turn assist process is complete, the previous process is interrupted and, as long as the turned-to-side siderails 20, 22 are in the up position as described above, and head section 38 is positioned at an angle less than or equal to 40\u00b0, the new turn assist mode is started.",
        "For example, assume a caregiver presses first turn assist button 1624. If the caregiver then presses second turn assist button 1626 while first turn assist bladder 2262 is inflating, then process 3032 will interrupt the inflation, bypass the post-turn assist phase (i.e., head and seat bladders 2302, 2304 will not be inflated), and begin inflating second turn assist bladder 2264 as long as siderails 20, 22 are up on the side of the bed the patient is being turned to, and the head angle is less than or equal to the maximum head angle. If the caregiver presses second turn assist button 1626 while first turn assist bladder 2262 is in post-turn assist mode, post-turn assist mode is interrupted and second turn assist bladder 2264 begins inflating as discussed above.",
        "Monitor activity step 3060 is a step that is periodically executed during the turn assist operation. The monitor activity process 3060 is shown in more detail in FIG. 127. This process 3060 detects whether a patient or caregiver attempts to utilize other bed features while either turn assist bladder 2262, 2264 is in operation. For example, at step 3062, process 3032 checks to see if siderail 20, 22 on the side to which the patient is being turned is raised or lowered. In the illustrated embodiment, if siderails 20, 22 are in the raised position at the beginning of turn assist, but one or more of them are lowered during turn assist, an audible signal or alarm is generated for a brief period at step 3064, or until the siderail 20, 22 is returned to the raised position, but the turn assist process 3032 is not interrupted. In alternative embodiments, however, upon detecting a lowering of siderail 20, 22, the turn assist process 3032 may be suspended for a brief period or stopped until or unless the lowered siderail 20, 22 is returned to the raised position.",
        "At step 3066, process 3060 detects whether a patient or caregiver has selected another mode, e.g., turn assist for the other side of the patient, max inflate, or pressure relief. During the turn assist operation, the selection of another mode causes process 3060 to begin exiting the turn assist mode at block 3067. If the other turn assist mode is selected, the current turn assist bladder 2262, 2264 is deflated and the other turn assist mode is entered substantially immediately. If the pressure relief mode or the max-inflate mode is selected, process 3060 immediately enters the post-turn assist operation and enters the newly selected mode upon completion of the post-turn assist phase. However, if the CPR function is activated, process 3060 immediately deflates turn assist bladder 2262, 2264 and enters the CPR mode substantially immediately. If no mode is selected during turn assist, process 3060 will exit as described previously and enter the pressure relief mode upon completion of the post-turn assist phase.",
        "At step 3068, process 3060 detects whether the angle of head section 38 has been increased above the maximum head angle as described above. If the head angle increases above the maximum head angle, an error message, e.g., in the form of an audible or visual signal, is generated at step 3069.

In the illustrative embodiment, a potentiometer reading corresponding to the head angle is determined by logic module 512 and reported to dynamic surface module 518 via network 510 for use in process 3070. In the illustrated embodiment the potentiometer reading is a value ranging from 0 to 255.

The potentiometer 624 in the motor housing of actuator 48c, which operates to raise and lower head section 38 varies proportionally with movement of the motor drive shaft 172c while actuator 48c is operating. The logic module 512 measures a change in voltage across potentiometer 624 in a voltage divider circuit and converts it to a digital value using A/D converter 620. The corresponding head angle is determined in process 3070 by reference to a look-up table stored in memory 3010.

If the head angle has changed at least approximately 3 degrees, the process 3070 continues to step 3076. If no change or less than approximately 3 degrees change in either direction has occurred, process 3070 returns to step 3072. It is understood that 3 degrees is an exemplary value and that a change in the head angle may be indicated by a greater or lesser value as appropriate. Of course, during this time, pressure control system 3000 continues to periodically measure the pressure of seat section air zone 2304 to make sure that it is within the desired ranges.",
        "At decision step 3076, it is determined whether the change in position of head section 38 occurred in the upward or downward direction. This determination is derived from the comparison of the current head angle to the previous head angle. As shown in Table 5, the ranges of values indicating a change in head elevation overlap, in order to take into consideration hysteresis in the head angle evaluation.",
        "For example, head section 38 will be considered to have moved from region zero to region 1 if a potentiometer value of about 52 is received by process 3070 (corresponding to a head angle of 1-10 degrees). However, once head section 38 is in region 1, it will not be considered to have moved back to region zero unless a potentiometer reading outside the specified range for region 1, e.g., approximately 40 or less, is received.",

The desired pressure range is determined by reference to a look-up table stored in memory 3010. Table 4 above is an example of such a table.",
        "If a change in position occurs in the upward direction, i.e., head section 38 is elevated, then at step 3080 the inflation pressure of seat section air zone 2304 is increased. First, a \u201cseat boost\u201d is applied to seat section air zone 2304, meaning that seat section air zone 2304 is initially over-inflated for a brief period of time to compensate for the above-mentioned weight shift. Examples of the initial \u201cseat boost\u201d pressures are shown in Table 2 above. In the illustrated embodiment, the period of time for the seat boost is about 15 seconds.

Referring to FIGS. 142 and 143, the upper bladder assembly 4222 defines a head section or air zone 4390 and a seat section or air zone 4392, wherein each zone 4390 and 4392 includes a respective bladder assembly 4394 and 4396. Both bladder assemblies 4394 and 4396 include a plurality of laterally extending bladders 4398 and 4400, respectively. Each bladder 4398, 4400 is movable independently from every other bladder 4398, 4400 and is separately coupled to the mounting substrate 4216. In the illustrated embodiment, a total of nine (9) bladders 4398a-4398i define the head section 4390, while a total of six (6) bladders 4400a-4400f define the seat section 4392. However, it should be appreciated that any number of bladders 4398, 4400 may be included within the various sections or zones 4390, 4392 of the mattress 4014.",
        "Each bladder 4398, 4400 is substantially identical to the bladders 4264 of the heel bladder assembly 4215. As such, similar or identical reference numbers are utilized to indicate similar or identical components in bladders 4264, 4398 and 4400. Bladders 4398, 4400 each includes upper and lower inflatable center portions 4402 and 4404 and opposing upper inflatable end portions 4406 and 4408. The upper inflatable center portion 4404 is separated from the end portions 4406 and 4408 by hinge portions 4403 and 4405. The end portions 4406 and 4408 define first and second notches or spaces 4407 and 4409 which are configured to provide clearance for movement of the bladder 4398 about the hinge portions 4403 and 4405. Webs 4415 and 4417 are located in the notches 4407 and 4409 and connect the lower center portion 4404 to the end portions 4406 and 4408, respectively.",
        "The bladders 4398, 4400 each include an upper fastener 4272 and a lower fastener 4274, illustratively snaps, configured to cooperate with the outer and inner fasteners 4332 and 4334 of the mounting substrate 4216. As illustrated in FIGS. 17 and 18, the inner mounting member 4330 is configured to move vertically relative to the outer mounting member 4328 through hinge 4329, thereby facilitating movement of the end portions 4406 and 4408 of the bladders 4398 relative to the center portions 4402 and 4404 of the bladders 4398. More particularly, the inner mounting member 4330 is configured to pivot relative to the outer mounting member 4328 about the hinge 4329. This coupling structure permits the end portions 4406 and 4408 of the bladders 4398 to hinge during operation of the turn assist bladder assembly 4220 and prevent undesirable raising of the end portions 4406 and 4408 or uncoupling from the mounting substrate 4216.",
        "Further, the couplings between the bladders 4398 of the upper bladder assembly 4220 and the mounting substrate 4216 define an upper crowning surface 4410. More particularly, the upper surface 4410 of the bladder assembly 4220 proximate the longitudinal center axis 4019 of the assembly 4220 is positioned vertically above the upper surface 4410 proximate the opposing longitudinal side edges 4412, 4413 of the bladder assembly 4220. Illustratively, the vertical distance of the crowning upper surface 4410 from the center axis 4019 to the respective side edges 4412, 4413, as represented by reference letter \u201cd\u201d in FIG. 140, is approximately 2 inches. The upper surface 4019 is arcuate as it extends from the center axis 4410 to the side edges 4412, 4413.",
        "The crowning surface 4410 is configured to facilitate lateral patient transfer from the bed 4010 to another patient support device positioned adjacent to the bed 4010 by creating an inclined surface which provides a slight amount of gravity assistance when the caregiver is moving the patient toward the side of the mattress 4014. Additionally, since the surface 4410 at the side edges 4412 and 4413 is lower than proximate the center axis 4411, the siderails 4020 and 4022 may have a lower profile and still fulfill minimum height requirements.",
        "FIG. 141 illustrates a right turn assist mode of operation wherein the right turn assist bladder 4358 is inflated. Since the right turn assist bladder 4358 is laterally offset from the longitudinal center axis 4019 of the mattress 4014, inflation of the bladder 4358 causes side edge 4413 of the upper bladder assembly 4222 to raise above the opposing side edge 4412. The hinge portions 4403 and 4405 between the end portions 4406 and 4408 and the center portion 4407 of the bladders 4398, 4400 of the upper bladder assembly 4222 permit the mattress 4014 to substantially conform to the shape resulting from the inflation of either turn assist bladder 4358, 4360. In an illustrative embodiment, upon inflation of one of the turn assist bladders 4358 and 4360, a patient supported on the mattress 4014 is rotated by an angle of approximately 20 degrees from horizontal. Upon completion of the turn assist, the control system 44 causes the inflated turn assist bladder 4358, 4360 to vent to atmosphere. Simultaneously, the upper bladder assembly 4222 is instructed by the central system 44 to inflate to a maximum pressure, also known as a max inflate mode of operation. Since the turn assist bladder assembly 4220 is sandwiched intermediate the upper bladder assembly 4222 and the filler 4218, inflation of the upper bladder assembly 4222 facilitates the rapid venting of air within the turn assist bladders 4358 and 4360 to atmosphere.",
        "A pair of seat attachment straps 4425 are configured to couple together selected air bladders 4440 of the seat bladder assembly 4396, illustratively bladders 4400a-4400c. The straps 4425 illustratively wrap around the bladders 4440a-4440c and have ends coupled together with conventional fasteners, such as buttons 4427.",
        "Fluid Tube Routing",
        "A head section fill tube 4414 and a head section sensor tube 4416 are coupled to the head section 4390. More particularly, the fill tube 4414 is fluidly coupled to the air bladder 4398e proximate the longitudinal center of the head section 4390, and the sensor tube 4416 is fluidly coupled to the air bladder 4398i proximate the seat section 4392. Both the fill tube 4414 and the sensor tube 4416 travel from respective bladders 4398e and 4398i in a generally longitudinal direction, to the mattress connector 4068 at the head end of the receiving base 4208, intermediate the bladders 4398 and the turn assist bladder assembly 4220. Both tubes 4414 and 4416 are received within securing loop 4338. A head section connection assembly 4418 fluidly connects each of the bladders 4398 and illustratively comprises a plurality of conventional T-shaped fluid connectors 4420 and L-shaped fluid connectors 4422.",
        "A seat section fill tube 4424 and a seat section sensor tube 4426 are coupled to the seat section 4392. More particularly, the fill tube 4424 is fluidly coupled to a seat section connection assembly 4428 which, in turn, is fluidly coupled to each air bladder 4400 of the seat bladder assembly 4396. The seat section connection assembly 4428 illustratively comprises a plurality of T-shaped fluid connectors 4420 and an L-shaped fluid connector 4422. The sensor tube 4426 is fluidly coupled to air bladder 4400d located proximate the longitudinal center of the seat section 4392. Both the fill tube 4424 and the sensor tube 4426 travel from the seat bladder assembly 4396 in a generally longitudinal direction to the mattress connector 4068 at the head end of the receiving base 4208. The fill tube 4424 travels along sidewall 4282 of the receiving base 4208 intermediate the upper bladder assembly 4222 and the turn assist bladder assembly 4220, and is received within securing loop 4339 of the mounting substrate 4216. Similarly, the sensor tube 4426 travels along sidewall 4281 of the receiving base 4208 intermediate the upper bladder assembly 4222 and the turn assist bladder assembly 4220, and is received within securing loop 4338 of the mounting substrate 4216.",
        "Fire Barrier",
        "Referring again to FIG. 130, the fire barrier 2124 receives the internal mattress components including the receiving base 4208, the mounting substrates 4214 and 4216, the foam filler 4218, the turn assist bladder assembly 4220, the upper bladder assembly 4222, and the heel bladder assembly 4215. The fire barrier 2124 includes an open end 2356 configured to permit the fire barrier 2124 to slide over the other mattress components. Upon assembly, the open end 2356 of the fire barrier 2124 is closed utilizing conventional means, such as fasteners. The fire barrier 2124 may be made from a conventional fire-resistant mesh material, such as a fiberglass knit.",
        "Shear Cover",
        "The shear cover 2125 is configured to fit over the above-identified mattress components as received within the fire barrier 2124. The shear cover 2125 is configured to be located between the fire barrier 2124 and the outer cover 2102 to permit the top cover portion 2106 to slide easily over the fire barrier 2124 and move relative to the other internal mattress components, thereby reducing shear forces between the patient's body and the mattress 4014 and reducing the likelihood of sacral breakdown.",
        "The shear cover 2125 is formed from a material having a low coefficient of friction so that the mattress outer cover 2102 can slide relative to the other mattress components. As the mattress 4014 is articulated or as the patient moves, the shear cover 2125 minimizes shear forces acting between the mattress top cover portion 2106 and the patient's body. The shear cover 2125 may be made from a woven nylon or parachute material. Illustratively, the shear cover 2125 is made from a polyurethane material such as Deerfield urethane PT611OS having a thickness of approximately 0.002 inches. The polyurethane material provides an inexpensive shear material which reduces shear forces applied to the patient's body situated on the mattress 4014.",
        "Additional details of the shear cover 2125 and the top cover portion 2106 are described above.",
        "Outer Cover",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 57 and 146, the bottom cover portion 2104 includes a bottom wall 2366 and a sidewall 2368. The sidewall 2368 is illustratively formed from a ticking material and is coupled to the sidewall 2364 of the top cover portion 2106, illustratively through RF welding. Illustratively, the bottom wall 2366 of the bottom cover portion 2104 is formed from a polyurethane coated twill material for enhanced wear resistance and to protect other components of the mattress 4014 from contamination. The bottom wall 2366 includes an access panel 2370 defined by a zipper 2372. The access panel 2370 is utilized during assembly of the mattress 4014 and further facilitates removal of the replacement of the modular components of the mattress 4014. Illustratively, the zipper 2372 is RF welded to the bottom wall 2366. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the zipper 2372 may be utilized to couple the sidewall 2368 of the bottom cover portion 2104 to the sidewall 2364 of the top cover portion 2106.",
        "With further reference to FIG. 146, the bottom cover portion 2104 includes a stress relief zone 2374 of extra material, which is illustratively pleated, to accommodate movement of the head section 4038 of the deck 26\u2032 relative to the seat section 4040 of the deck 26\u2032. More particularly, as the head section 4038 is elevated relative to the seat section 4040, the head portion 4292 of the receiving base 4208 moves relative to the seat portion 4294 of the receiving base 4208. The slit 4296, and connected stress relief apertures, reduce the stress applied to the receiving base 4208 during this movement. Likewise, the stress relief zone 2374 of the bottom cover portion 2104 reduces stress within the outer cover 2102 of the mattress 4014. As the mattress 4014 bends to follow the contour of the deck 26\u2032, the extra material within the stress relief zone 2374 accounts for the increased distance between the head portion 4292 and the seat portion 4294 proximate the bottom cover portion 2104.",
        "Mattress Anchors",
        "With further reference to FIGS. 7130, 132, 133, and 146, the foot section anchor 4246 is coupled to the foot section 4210 of the receiving base 4208 below the bottom cover portion 2104, illustratively through fasteners 4247 threadably received within the foot section mounting plate 4242. Likewise, the head section anchor 4320 is secured to the head portion 4292 of the receiving base 4208 below the bottom cover portion 2104, illustratively through fasteners 4247 threadably received within the head section mounting plate 4316. The foot section anchor 4246 and the head section anchor 4320, each illustratively comprises a resilient tab or strip 4429 having opposing first and second ends 4430 and 4431 which may be flexed away from the bottom cover portion 2104 of the mattress 4014, and placed under the respective retaining brackets 4082 and 4080 formed within the leg section 42\u2032 and the head section 38\u2032 of the deck 26\u2032, respectively, as illustrated in FIG. 129.",

In the illustrative embodiment, each sensing line 4278, 4370, 4372, 4416, and 4426 supplies air to the mattress connector 4068 which, in turn, provides air to the manifold connector 4070. The air exits the manifold connector 4070 through pressure sensing tubes 2440. Each tube 2440 is coupled to a pressure sensor 566 supported on a valve controller circuit board 2444. The circuit board 2444 is in communication with the control system 44 and as such, provides signals to the control system 44 indicative of pressure within the various controlled air zones of the mattress 4014. In an alternative embodiment, each sensing line 4278, 4370, 4372, 4416, and 4426 supplies air which passes through fluid sensing ports (not shown) formed within the manifold 4063 and then exits through pressure sensing tubes 2440.",

If the sensor 4462 does not detect that a mattress 4014 has been connected to the control system 44 by the coupling of the mattress connector 4068 to the manifold connector 4070, then the control system 44 does not permit operation of the air mattress functions.",
        "According to an illustrative embodiment, the sensor 4462 comprises a Hall effect field sensor 4464 that detects the characteristics of a dynamic field generated by the mattress connector 4068. More particularly, a magnet 4466 is positioned within a receiving boss 4468 of the mattress connector 4068 (FIG. 151). The manifold connector 4070 includes an opening 4470 configured to receive the boss 4468, and the magnet 4466 received therein, when the mattress connector 4068 is fluidly coupled with the manifold connector 4070. As such, the Hall effect sensor 4464 detects the magnetic field generated by the magnet 4466. Based upon the detection of the predetermined magnetic field, the sensor 4464 sends a signal indicative of the respective mattress 4014 to the control system 44. The control system 44 then permits operation of the air mattress functions.",

The transistor 4478 and the resistor 4480 are coupled to the output of the circuit. Illustratively, the resistor 4480 has a value of 470 ohms, and the sensor 4464 is a Cherry MP1013 Snap Fit Proximity Sensor that detects magnetic fields and is sold by the Cherry Corporation, 3600 Sunset Avenue, Waukegan, Ill. It should be appreciated that based upon the desired control characteristics, the value of the resistor 4480 and the proximity sensor 4464 may be varied.",
        "Further, the type and functionality of an air mattress 4014 connected to the manifold connector 4070 may be associated with a predetermined sensitivity of Hall effect sensor 4464 or strength of magnet 4466. Alternatively, multiple magnets 4466 and associated Hall effect sensors 4464 may be used to distinguish between different types of mattresses 4014. Upon sensing a particular type of mattress 4014, the control system 44 may deactivate and/or activate selected functions. For example, should the control system 44 receive a signal from the mattress sensor 4462 indicating that the mattress 4014 has no turn assist bladder assembly 4220, then the left and right turn assist functionality may be deactivated.",
        "In a further illustrative embodiment, the presence of the fluid connector 4068 of the mattress 4014 may be detected by the pressure sensors, illustratively pressure transducers 566, which are in communication with the control system 44. More particularly, the control system 44 can initiate a diagnostic routine or process at predetermined intervals by supplying pressure to the outlets 4436 in the manifold connector 4070. Should no mattress 4014 be connected to the manifold connector 4070, then the pressure transducers 566 connected to the sensor outlets 4438 will measure atmospheric pressure (i.e., no back pressure). However, if a mattress 4014 is connected, then the sensor outlets 4438, upon the application of fluid through the fill outlets 4436, will measure a certain amount of back pressure. As such, through this diagnostic routine, the control system 44 can determine if a mattress 4014 is connected to the manifold 4063, and also which outlets 4436 are connected to respective air zones 4254, 4358, 4360, 4390 and 4392. Again, if the control system 44, through operation of the pressure sensors 566, determines that only certain air zones 4254, 4358, 4360, 4390, and 4392 are coupled to the manifold 4063, then certain functions may be activated and others deactivated.",

Analog-to-digital converter 3002 converts the voltage to digital form and feeds the digital value to microcontroller 3004. Microcontroller 3004 analyzes the current pressure and determines whether the current pressure in controlled air zones 4254, 4358, 4360, 4390, and 4392 is correct, too high, or too low in comparison to a desired pressure. Memory 3010 stores data, illustratively in the form of look-up tables or algorithms, which is used in this analysis. For example, the desired pressure of air zones 4254, 4358, 4360, 4390, and 4392 may depend on the particular operating mode of the system 3000 (e.g., pressure relief, max-inflate, CPR, turn assist, and post-turn assist), whether head section 4038 is elevated and the degree of elevation, and/or the size or weight of the patient. The microcontroller 3004 operates valve solenoids 564 in response to the feedback signals from pressure transducers 566 to achieve the desired adjustments to mattress 4014. The valve solenoids 564 control the flow of air to and resulting pressure within the mattress 4014. Additional details regarding the valve solenoids 564 are provided above.",
        "Valve Sensor",
        "With reference now to FIG. 153, a valve sensor 4484 is operably coupled to the valve solenoids 564 to determine the type of pneumatic valve 2406 application or technology. More particularly, the valve sensor 4484 determines the presence of either (1) a direct acting solenoid valve or (2) a pilot operated, or pilot assisted, solenoid valve. The operational requirements for these two types of valves differ. The direct acting solenoid valve pulls more current from a solenoid voltage source 4486, and therefore pulse modulation of the current is employed. The pilot operated solenoid valve requires the application and maintenance of a pilot air pressure.",
        "The determination of the particular type of valve 2406 is achieved by energizing each connected solenoid 564 individually. When a valve 2406 is actuated by the closing of a valve control relay 4488, the current pulled by the respective solenoid 564 is measured by a current transducer 4490. This measurement is supplied to an analog to digital converter 4492 which, in turn, supplies the measurement to a microcontroller, illustratively the microcontroller 3004 of the pressure control system 3000. Alternatively, the microcontroller may be independent of the microcontroller 3004. The microcontroller 3004 compares the measurement to known operating current values which are representative of the direct acting solenoid valve and the pilot operated solenoid valve. This comparison is the basis for deciding the type of valve 2406 (i.e. direct acting solenoid valve or pilot operated solenoid valve).",
        "If the microcontroller 3004 determines that the number and types of valves 2406 equal a predetermined configuration, then the valves 2406 are driven by the microcontroller 3004 as appropriate for those types. If the microcontroller 3004 determines that the number and types of valves 2406 does not equal the predetermined configuration, then an error is reported by the microcontroller 3004. In one illustrative embodiment, the predetermined configuration is defined such that all of the valves 2406 coupled to the manifold 4063 are pilot operated solenoid valves. As such, the microcontroller 3004 queries whether all of the valves 2406 are pilot operated solenoid valves. If so, then the valves 2406 are driven by the microcontroller 3004 as appropriate for pilot operated solenoid valves. If the valves 2406 collectively are determined not to be of the predetermined configuration, in this illustrative embodiment meaning that all of the valves 2406 are not pilot operated solenoid valves, then the microcontroller 3004 reports an error. It should be appreciated that the predetermined configuration may comprise all direct acting solenoid valves, all pilot operated solenoid valves, or any combination thereof.",
        "As further illustrated in FIG. 153, a supervisor relay 4496 may be positioned intermediate the solenoid voltage source 4486 and the current transducer 4490. Further, the solenoid 564 is coupled to ground 4498 through the valve control relay 4488.",
        "The valve sensor 4484 permits the utilization of different predetermined configurations of valves 2406 in different patient supports. More particularly, the configuration of valves 2406 may be varied for different types or model years of patient supports in order to facilitate cost effectiveness and to take advantage of technological developments in valve design. For example, in a first patient support, all pilot operated valves may be utilized and the predetermined configuration stored in the microcontroller 3004 reflects this situation. However, in a later second patient support, all direct acting solenoid valves may be utilized. As such, the microcontroller 3004 may be modified or re-programmed to detect this new predetermined configuration.",

        "With reference now to FIG. 154, an illustrative process 4710 of operation of the dynamic surface module 518 incorporating the mattress sensor 4462 begins at block 4712 with the operator or caregiver depressing appropriate keys or buttons on the one of the controllers 50, 52, 54 to deactivate or turn off the air pressure control system 3000. For example, in one embodiment, the operator simultaneously depresses the \u201cPressure Relief\u201d button 1628 and the \u201cMax Inflate\u201d button 1622 on the controller 54 for a minimum of five (5) seconds in order to cause the pressure control system 3000 to deactivate or enter into an OFF mode. By deactivating the pressure control system 3000, continuous alarms or error messages for alerting the operator of the absence of an air mattress 4014 coupling are eliminated. In other words, if the pressure control system 3000 is active or in an ON mode when the air mattress 4014 is uncoupled from the control system 44 of the bed 4010, then the mattress sensor 4462 detects the absence of the air mattress 4014 and controller 3004 causes an error code to display on panel 1242 of the controller 54 and causes the activation of an audible alarm for a preset time period.",
        "Next, as indicated at block 4714, the pressures in the head, seat, right turn assist and left turn assist zones 4390, 4392, 4360 and 4362 are not regulated by the pressure control system 3000. Further, all air mode indicators 1518 on the controller 54 are deactivated or off. At block 4716, the controller 3004 queries whether a mode button 1622, 1624, 1626, 1628 for operation of the pressure control system 3000, has been selected on the controller 54. If not, then the process returns to block 4714. If a mode button 1622, 1624, 1626, 1628 has been selected, then the process continues to decision block 4718, where the controller 3004 determines if the mattress sensor 4462 detects a mattress 4014.",
        "If at block 4718, the mattress sensor 4462 does not detect a coupled mattress 4014, then the controller 3004 at block 4720 flashes selected mode indicators 1518 on the controller 54 and also sounds an audible alarm for a selected time period. The process then returns to block 4714. If at block 4718, the mattress sensor 4462 detects a coupled mattress 4014, then the process continues to block 4722 when the pressure controller 3000 enters or initiates the selected mode of operation.",
        "As such, it may be appreciated that the mattress sensor 4462 of the present invention provides the operator with the flexibility of utilizing the bed 10\u2032 with a dynamic air mattress 4014 or some other support surface, such as a static foam mattress. If the bed 10\u2032 is to be used with a static foam mattress, for example, then the mattress sensor 4462 signals the controller 3004 which, in turn, cannot be activated by the operator. The pressure control system 3000 remains in an inactive or OFF mode, thereby locking out an operator from activating or turning ON the pressure control system 3000 and attempting to use the system on a foam mattress.",
        "The controller 3004 of pressure control system 3000 regulates pressure within the air mattress 4014. If the pressure of an air zone 4254, 4358, 4360, 4390, and 4392 is too high, controller 3004 actuates the appropriate valve assembly actuator 564 to allow air to escape from the air zone 4254, 4358, 4360, 4390, and 4392. If the pressure is too low, microcontroller 3004 sends a message over network 510 to power supply module 514 of patient support 4010 (parts of which are generally depicted in FIG. 124 as power supply 3006), and power supply 3006 activates pump 4064. When microcontroller 3004 detects that pump 4064 is turned on, it actuates the appropriate valve assembly actuator 564 to allow air to enter the respective air zone 4254, 4358, 4360, 4390, 4392.",

One illustrative embodiment of process 4730 is shown in FIG. 155 and described below.",
        "In certain illustrative embodiments as detailed above, an operator or caregiver is required to select an appropriate patient weight. In still other embodiments, the controller 3004 automatically selects a default setting, e.g., the \u201cmedium\u201d size, if a patient weight is not selected by the operator or caregiver.",
        "In yet another illustrative embodiment, pressure control system 3000 automatically determines the patient's weight through measurements by weigh frame 36 and/or by a force sensor supported by seat section 40\u2032. More particularly, and with reference to FIGS. 129 and 156, the patient's weight is derived from an algorithm whose inputs include force sensing resistors (FSRs) 5002, 5004, 5006, 5008, and 5010 supported on the deck 26\u2032 below the mattress 4014, and the four load cells 220, 222, 224, and 226 forming a portion of the in-bed scale weighing system. The load cells 220, 222, 224, 226 are coupled to the scale controller 5012, which is configured to perform diagnostic evaluations of the load cells to determine if they are working properly. In the illustrative embodiment, there are a total of five FSRs, including three FSRs 5002, 5004, and 5006 supported by the head section 38\u2032 of the bed deck 26\u2032, and two FSRs 5008 and 5010 supported by the seat section 40\u2032 of the bed deck 26\u2032. The two FSRs 5008 and 5010 in the seat section 40\u2032 and one of the FSRs 5004 in the head section 38\u2032 are connected to a scale controller 5012. These FSRs 5004, 5008, and 5010 are used for a patient position monitoring (PPM) system operated by the scale controller 5012 and which is configured to notify a caregiver when the patient changes position relative to the patient support 10\u2032. The two additional FSRs 5002 and 5006 in the head section 38\u2032 are connected to the air controller 3004. These two additional FSRs 5002 and 5006 provide additional detection coverage in the head section 4038, and also provide a diagnostic function in order to allow the air controller 3004 to determine when these FSRs 5002 and 5006 are disconnected or malfunctioning.",
        "The FSRs are of conventional design and have resistance values which change depending upon the amount of force applied thereto. FSRs generally comprise polymer thick film (PTF) devices which exhibit a decrease in resistance with an increase in the force applied to an active surface. More particularly, the resistance of the FSRs drop below a predetermined value when a certain force is applied. While force sensing resistors (FSRs) are utilized in the illustrated embodiment, it should be appreciated that other sensors for detecting the presence of a patient supported on the head section 4390 and the seat section 4392 of the mattress 4014 may be substituted therefore. Illustratively, the FSRs are available from Interlink Electronics of Camarillo, Calif. as part number 408.",
        "Patient Weight Determination",
        "As noted above, four load cells 220, 222, 224, and 226 are attached to the four corners of the weigh frame 36 of the bed 10\u2032. The summation of these four load cells 220, 222, 224, and 226, when their output is converted to a weight, provide the total weight supported by the weigh frame 36. The weight of weigh frame 36 and anything supported by weigh frame 36, such as deck 26\u2032, mattress 4014, any other bed components supported on weigh frame 36, and a patient, is transmitted to load cells 220, 222, 224, 226. This weight deflects or otherwise changes a characteristic of load cells 220, 222, 224, 226 that is detected to determine the total weight supported thereby. By subtracting a known weight of weigh frame 36, deck 26\u2032, mattress 4014 and any other bed components supported on weigh frame 36, the weight of the patient positioned on patient support 10 can be determined. Additional description of load cells and methods for determining a patient's weight, position in the bed, and other indications provided by load cells is provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/669,707, filed Sep. 26, 2000, titled Load Cell Apparatus, to Mobley et al., and PCT international patent application Ser. No. PCT/US/08189, titled Hospital Bed Control Apparatus, to Dixon et al., the disclosures of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein. In one illustrative embodiment, the load cells are available from HBM, Inc. of Marlborough, Mass. According to alternative embodiments of the present disclosure, other configurations and methods of using load cells or other devices to determine a patient's weight or other information related to the patient known to those of ordinary skill in the art are provided.",
        "Information from the scale controller 5012 is transmitted to the air controller 3004 through the controller area network (CAN) 510. The information is parsed into seven data sets (four load cells 220, 222, 224, 226, three FSRs 5004, 5008, 5010) with each transmission being spaced apart by approximately 100 milliseconds. Along with each data set is an error byte that contains diagnostic information pertaining to the load cells 220, 222, 224, 226.",
        "Referring further to the flow chart of FIG. 155, the illustrative process begins upon appropriate activation of the controller 3004 and with the initialization of all variables. Next, the process continues at block 4734, where the scale controller 5012 determines the weight of the patient, as represented by the variable Patient_Weight. In the illustrative process 4730, the value of Patient_Weight is determined by the subprocess 5020 illustrated in FIGS. 157 and 158.",
        "Process 5020 begins at block 5022 with the initialization of all variables. As detailed below, the variable Load_Beam_Offset is set to equal a value from the most recent operation of the controller 3004. At decision block 5024, the controller 3004 queries whether it is ready for processing data. More particularly, the controller 3004 determines whether a complete set of data from the FSRs 5002, 5004, 5006, 5008, 5010 and load cells 220, 222, 224, 226 is available for utilization. As noted above, a complete set of updated data is received every 700 milliseconds. More particularly, seven packages of data are received from the scale controller 5012 at the rate of one package every 100 milliseconds. Two additional packages of information are received from the first and third head section FSRs 5002 and 5006, one every 350 milliseconds. If a complete new set of data from the FSRs 5002, 5004, 5006, 5008, 5010 and the load cells 220, 222, 224, 226 is not available, then the process returns at block 5026 to start block 5022. If decision block 5024 is answered in the affirmative, then the process continues to decision block 5028 where the controller 3004 processes data from the FSRs 5002 and 5006 and the scale controller 5012. More particularly, the processor 3004 determines the value of the variable Load_Beam_Total to be equal to the sum of the four inputs from the load cells 220, 222, 224, 226. The controller 3004 further analyzes the values from the FSRs 5002, 5004, 5006, 5008, 5010. If any of the FSRs 5002, 5004, 5006, 5008, 5010 have a resistance indicating the presence of a patient, then the controller 3004 sets the flag Patient_Present to TRUE.",
        "The process 5020 next continues to block 5030 where the controller 3004 queries whether the data from both the FSRs 5002, 5004, 5006, 5008, 5010 and the scale controller 5012 are stable. More particularly, the controller 3004 queries whether the patient has been consistently detected as being present or not present for a minimum predetermined amount of time. In the illustrative embodiment, if (1) the patient has been detected for at least approximately 3.5 seconds as indicated by the flag Patient_Present being set to TRUE, or (2) the patient has not been detected for at least approximately 3.5 seconds as indicated by the flag Patient_Present being set to FALSE, then the FSR data is considered stable. Similarly, if the Load_Beam_Total variable has not changed by more than five pounds for at least approximately 3.5 seconds, then the scale data is considered stable. If the controller 3004 determines that the data is not stable at block 5030, then the process proceeds to block 5026. If the data is considered stable, then the process 5020 then continues to process block 5032.",

In order for the FSR data to be considered stable by the controller 3004, then (1) all of the FSRs in either the first group or the second group must not detect a patient for at least approximately 3.5 seconds, or (2) any of the FSRs in either the first group or the second group must detect a patient for at least approximately 3.5 seconds.",

More particularly, the controller sets Load_Beam_Adj to be equal to the variable Load_Beam_Total minus the variable Load_Beam_Offset. As mentioned above, the variable Load_Beam_Offset is saved from the prior operation of the controller 3004. The Load_Beam_Offset is defined as the weight measured by the scale controller 5012 prior to a patient getting on the bed 10\u2032 and being supported by the weigh frame 36, and following the addition of the mattress 4014, footboard 18 and any other equipment supported by the weigh frame 36. The Load_Beam_Offset takes into consideration the factory calibration, typically the zeroing or initializing of the weight measured by the scale controller 5012 without the mattress 4014, footboard 18, or other equipment supported by the weigh frame 36. In summary, the Load_Beam_Offset is equal to a load applied to the weigh frame 36 in excess of that when the bed 10\u2032 is calibrated during manufacture and without the patient supported by the weigh frame 36.",

More particularly, the controller 3004 queries whether (1) the variable Load_Beam_Adj is less than zero or (2) the variable Load_Beam_Adj is less than a maximum detected offset value and the flag Patient_Present is FALSE. The first instance, where the Load_Beam_Adj is negative, could occur where equipment has been removed from the weigh frame 36 since the last operation of the controller 3004.

As such, the controller 3004 resets the Load_Beam_Offset to be equal to the value of the Load_Beam_Total. The process then continues at block 5038 where the controller 3004 recalculates the variable Load_Beam_Adj.

Illustratively, the minimum patient weight change is defined as approximately ten pounds. If the variable Load_Beam_Adj is greater than a maximum patient weight, then the controller 3004 sets Patient_Weight to be equal to a default maximum patient weight. Illustratively, the maximum patient weight is defined as approximately 350 pounds, while the default maximum patient weight is defined as approximately 400 pounds. If the variable Load_Beam_Adj is less than a minimum patient weight, then the variable Patient_Weight is set to be equal to a default minimum patient weight.

The predetermined time is empirically determined by the needs and desires of the patient and caregiver in an operating environment and illustratively is a time within a range of approximately 5 seconds to approximately 5 minutes. In the illustrative embodiment, the duration of turn assist inflation is about 10 seconds. At step 3050 the timer counts out this wait period. After the wait period is complete (e.g., after 10 seconds), an audible or visual signal is generated to indicate to the patient and caregiver that the selected turn assist bladder 4358, 4360 is about to enter a \u201cpost-turn assist\u201d mode or phase.",
        "In the post-turn assist mode, process 3032 begins deflating the selected turn assist bladder 4358, 4360 at step 3052. In the illustrated embodiment, deflation is expedited by quickly \u201chyperinflating\u201d bladders of the head and seat sections 4390 and 4392 to a firm, \u201cpost-turn assist\u201d inflation pressure (see, e.g., Table 6 and Table 7). Inflation of head and seat sections 4390 and 4392 exerts pressure on turn assist bladders 4358, 4360 causing turn assist bladders 4358, 4360 to expel air more rapidly. Alternatively, a vacuum mechanism may be coupled to turn assist bladders 4358, 4360 to accelerate deflation.",
        "Monitor activity step 3060 is a step that is periodically executed during the turn assist operation. This process detects whether a patient or caregiver attempts to utilize other bed features while the turn assist is in operation. Additional details regarding the operation of the dynamic surface module are provided above.",
        "CPR Configuration",
        "Patient support 10\u2032 may be placed in the preferred CPR configuration by providing an indication to control system 44 which in turn controls actuators 48c, 48d, 48e to place head, seat, and leg sections in a generally linear relationship, controls pump 4064, to inflate upper bladder assembly 4222 to the desired pressures, and controls deck support 24 to lower a head end relative to a foot end. In the illustrative embodiment, the control system 44 inflates the bladder assembly 4394 of the head section 4390 to its desired CPR pressure before it inflates the bladder assembly 4396 of the seat section 4392 to its desired CPR pressure. As such, the head section 4390 reaches its desired firmness prior to the seat section 4392. This functionality is desirable since CPR procedures typically require pressure to be applied to the upper torso or chest of a patient.",
        "Mattress Air Pump",
        "Pump 64 is configured to provide pressurized air to manifold 62 and the pneumatic devices of mattresses 14, 4014.

Side walls 5524, 5526, 5528 cooperate to form a pair of slits or inlets 5532 therebetween and side wall 5526 includes a pair of apertures 5534. As shown in FIG. 165, lower end of filter and muffler unit 5452 is spaced apart from bottom wall 5530 by a distance 5531 so that a downwardly facing inlet 5536 of filter and muffler unit 5452 is spaced apart and facing bottom wall 5530. A cable tie 5538 is provided that wraps around filter and muffler unit 5452 and extends through apertures 5534 to couple filter and muffler unit 5452 to side wall 5526.",
        "If liquid is sprayed into or otherwise enters pan 5522, it will drain out of slits 5532. Furthermore, because inlet 5536 is facing and relative close to bottom wall 5530, liquid cannot be sprayed into inlet 5536 through slits 5532 from outside of pan 5522 because the path between slits 5532 and inlet 5536 is non-linear. Thus, pan 5522 blocks any direct spray path into inlet 5536 so that it is difficult for liquid to inter filter and muffler unit 5452.",
