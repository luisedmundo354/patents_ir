The switching converters of the types mentioned are restricted in suppression of switching noise because the switching operation waveform is a rectangular waveform. Further, it is known that the switching converters are limited in enhancement in the power conversion efficiency from their operation characteristics.",
        "Therefore, various switching power supply circuits which rely upon various resonance type converters have been proposed by the applicant of the present application. According to the resonance type converters, a high power conversion efficiency can be obtained readily, and low noise is achieved because the switching operation waveform is a sine waveform. Further, the resonance type converters have a merit also that they can be formed from a comparatively small number of parts.",
        "FIG. 21 is a circuit diagram showing an example of a configuration of a power supply circuit which can be configured based on the invention proposed formerly by the applicant of the present application. The power supply circuit adopts a self-excited current resonance type converter.",
        "The switching power supply circuit shown in this figure includes, as a rectification circuit system for producing a DC input voltage (rectified smoothed voltage Ei) from a commercial AC power supply (AC input voltage VAC), a voltage doubler rectification circuit including two rectification diodes D1 and D2 of the low speed recovery type and two smoothing capacitors Ci1 and Ci2 connected in such a manner as seen in the figure. In the voltage doubler rectification circuit, a rectified smoothed voltage Ei corresponding to twice the AC input voltage VAC is generated across the smoothing capacitors Ci1 and Ci2 connected in series.",
        "The switching converter of the power supply circuit includes two switching elements Q1 and Q2 connected in half bridge connection and interposed between a positive electrode side node of the smoothing capacitor Ci1 and the ground point as seen in the figure. In this instance, a bipolar transistor (BJT; junction type transistor) having a withstanding voltage of 400 V is adopted for the switching elements Q1 and Q2.",
        "Starting resistors RS1 and RS2 are inserted between the collector and the base of the switching elements Q1 and Q2, respectively.",
        "Further, clamp diodes DD1 and DD2 are connected between the base and the emitter of the switching elements Q1 and Q2, respectively. In this instance, the cathode of the clamp diode DD1 is connected to the base of the switching element Q1, and the anode of the clamp diode DD1 is connected to the emitter of the switching element Q1. Meanwhile, the cathode of the clamp diode DD2 is connected to the base of the switching element Q2 and the anode of the clamp diode DD2 is connected to the emitter of the switching element Q2 similarly.",

The capacitance of the resonating capacitor CB1 itself and the inductance LB1 of the driving winding NB1 cooperatively form a series resonance circuit.",
        "Similarly, another series connection circuit of a base current limiting resistor RB2, a resonating capacitor CB2 and a driving winding NB2 is interposed between the base of the switching element Q2 and the primary side ground, and the resonating capacitor CB2 and the inductance LB2 of the driving winding NB2 cooperatively form a series resonance circuit for self oscillation.",
        "An orthogonal control transformer PRT (Power Regulating Transformer) drives the switching elements Q1 and Q2 and performs constant voltage control in such a manner as hereinafter described.",

The resonance current detection winding NA and the driving winding NB are wound in the same winding direction on predetermined two ones of the magnetic legs of the solid core. Further, the control winding NC is wound in a direction orthogonal to that of the resonance current detection winding NA and the driving winding NB.",

The driving winding NB2 is connected at one end thereof to the ground and at the other end thereof to the base of the switching element Q2 through a series connection of the resonating capacitor CB2 and the resistor RB2. The driving winding NB1 and the driving winding NB2 are wound such that voltages of the opposite polarities to each other are generated therein.",
        "Meanwhile, the resonance current detection winding NA is connected at one end thereof to a node (switching output point) between the emitter of the switching element Q1 and the collector of the switching element Q2 and at the other end thereof to one end of a primary winding N1 of an insulating converter transformer (Power Isolation Transformer) PIT hereinafter described. It is to be noted that the number of turns (turn number) of the resonance current detection winding NA is, for example, approximately 1 T (turn).",

The primary winding N1 (N4) and a secondary winding N2 (N3) are wound in a divided state on the central magnetic leg of the E-E type core making use of a divisional bobbin B. In this instance, a Litz wire of approximately 60 mm\u03c6 is wound in a pattern winding on the divisional bobbin B to form the primary winding N1 (N4) and the secondary winding N2 (N3).",
        "Further, in this instance, a gap G of 0.5 mm to 1.0 mm is formed in the central magnetic leg of the E-E type core. By the gap G, the coupling coefficient k of the primary winding N1 and the secondary winding N2 (N3) is set so that a loose coupling state of, for example, k\u22480.8 is obtained.",
        "The primary winding N1 of the insulating converter transformer PIT is connected at one end thereof to a node (switching output point) between the emitter of the switching element Q1 and the collector of the switching element Q2 through the resonance current detection winding NA so that a switching output may be obtained. The primary winding N1 is connected at the other end thereof to the primary side ground through a primary side series resonance capacitor C1 formed from, for example, a film capacitor.",
        "In this instance, the primary side series resonance capacitor C1 and the primary winding N1 are connected in series, and the capacitance of the primary side series resonance capacitor C1 and a leakage inductance component of the insulating converter transformer PIT including the primary winding N1 (series resonance winding) cooperatively form a series resonance circuit for making operation of the switching converter as that of the current resonance type.",
        "A primary side partial voltage resonance capacitor Cp for primary side partial voltage resonance is connected in parallel between the collector and the emitter of the switching element Q2, and the primary side partial voltage resonance capacitor Cp and the leakage inductance of the primary winding N1 form a partial voltage resonance circuit. Consequently, the switching elements Q1 and Q2 can perform zero voltage switching (ZVS) operation and zero current switching (ZCS).",
        "With the primary side switching converter shown in the figure, operation of the current resonance type by the primary side series resonance circuit (L1-C1) and partial voltage resonance operation by the partial voltage resonance circuit (Cp//L1) are obtained.",
        "In short, the power supply circuit shown in the figure adopts a form wherein a resonance circuit for making the primary side switching converter that of the resonance type is combined with another resonance circuit. In the present specification, a switching converter of the type just described is referred to as composite resonance type converter.",
        "Further, on the secondary side of the insulating converter transformer PIT shown in the figure, the secondary windings N2 and N3 are wound independently of each other. Further, a bridge rectification circuit DBR and a smoothing capacitor C01 are connected to the secondary winding N2 to produce a secondary side DC output voltage E01. Meanwhile, a center tap is provided for the secondary winding N3, and rectification diodes D01 and D02 and a smoothing capacitor C02 are connected in such a manner as seen in the figure to the secondary winding N3 to form a full wave rectification circuit consisting of the [rectification diodes D01 and D02 and smoothing capacitor C02] to produce a secondary side DC output voltage E02.",
        "In this instance, the secondary side DC output voltage E01 is branched and inputted also to a control circuit 1.",
        "The control circuit 1 supplies DC current, whose level varies, for example, in response to the level of the secondary side DC output voltage E01 on the secondary side, as control current to the control winding NC of the orthogonal control transformer PRT to perform constant voltage control as hereinafter described.",
        "As switching operation of the power supply circuit having the configuration described above, when a commercial AC power supply is made available first, starting current is supplied to the base of the switching elements Q1 and Q2, for example, through the starting resistors RS1 and RS2, and, for example, if the switching element Q1 is turned on first, then the switching element Q2 is controlled so as to be turned off. Then, resonance current flows as an output of the switching element Q1 through the resonance current detection winding NA\u2192primary winding N1\u2192primary side series resonance capacitor C1. The switching elements Q1 and Q2 are controlled so that the switching element Q2 is turned on and the switching element Q1 is turned off in the proximity of a point of time at which the resonance current becomes zero. Then, resonance current in the reverse direction flows through the switching element Q2. Thereafter, self-excited switching operation wherein the switching elements Q1 and Q2 are turned on alternately is started.",
        "Since the switching elements Q1 and Q2 repeat on/off operations alternately using the terminal voltage of the smoothing capacitor Ci as an operation power supply in this manner, drive current having a waveform proximate to a resonance current waveform is supplied to the primary winding N1 of the insulating converter transformer PIT and an alternating output is obtained at the secondary windings N2 and N3.",
        "The constant voltage control by the orthogonal control transformer PRT is performed in the following manner.",
        "For example, if the secondary side DC output voltage E01 is varied by a variation of the AC input voltage or the load power, then the control circuit 1 variably controls the level of the control current to flow to the control winding NC in response to the variation of the secondary side DC output voltage E01.",
        "By an influence of magnetic fluxes which are generated in the orthogonal control transformer PRT by the control current, the state of a saturation tendency of the orthogonal control transformer PRT changes, which acts to vary the inductance of the driving windings NB1 and NB2. As a result, the conditions of the self-excited oscillation circuit are varied to control the switching frequency fs to vary.",
        "In the power supply circuit shown in the figure, the switching frequency fs is set in a frequency region higher than the resonance frequency of the series resonance circuit of the primary side series resonance capacitor C1 and the primary winding N1, and, for example, if the switching frequency fs becomes higher, then the switching frequency fs is spaced away from the resonance frequency of the series resonance circuit. Consequently, the resonance impedance of the primary side series resonance circuit to the switching output becomes higher.",
        "Since the resonance impedance becomes higher in this manner, the drive current to be supplied to the primary winding N1 of the primary side series resonance circuit is suppressed, and as a result, the secondary side DC output voltage is suppressed thereby to achieve constant voltage control.",
        "FIG. 22 is a circuit diagram showing an example of a configuration of another power supply circuit which can be configured based on the invention proposed formerly by the applicant of the present application. It is to be noted that like elements to those of the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 21 are denoted by like reference characters and description thereof is omitted herein.",
        "Also the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 22 includes a current resonance type converter wherein two switching elements Q11 and Q12 are connected in a half bridge connection, but the driving method thereof is the separate excitation method. In this instance, a MOS-FET or an IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) is adopted for the switching elements Q11 and Q12.",
        "Further, in this instance, a rectification smoothing circuit formed from a bridge rectification circuit Di and a smoothing capacitor Ci rectifies and smoothes an AC input voltage VAC of a commercial AC power supply AC to produce a DC input voltage, for example, equal to a peak value of the AC input voltage VAC.",
        "The switching elements Q11 and Q12 are connected at the gate thereof to an oscillation and drive circuit 11. The drain of the switching element Q11 is connected to the positive electrode of the smoothing capacitor Ci while the source of the switching element Q11 is connected to the primary side ground through the primary winding N1 and the primary side series resonance capacitor C1. Meanwhile, the drain of the switching element Q12 is connected to the source of the switching element Q11, and the source of the switching element Q12 is connected to the primary side ground.",
        "Also here, a primary side partial voltage resonance capacitor Cp for primary side partial voltage resonance is connected in parallel to the drain-source of the switching element Q12.",
        "Further, clamp diodes DD1 and DD2 are connected in parallel between the drain and the source of the switching elements Q11 and Q12.",
        "The switching elements Q11 and Q12 are driven for switching so that switching operation similar to that described hereinabove with reference to FIG. 21 by the oscillation and drive circuit 11 may be obtained.",
        "In particular, the control circuit 1 in this instance supplies current or a voltage of a level, which varies in response to a variation of the secondary side DC output voltage E01, to the oscillation and drive circuit 11 on the primary side through a photo-coupler PC. The oscillation and drive circuit 11 outputs a switching driving signal (voltage), whose period varies in response to the output level from the control circuit 1, alternately to the gates of the switching elements Q11 and Q12 so that stabilization of the secondary side DC output voltage E01 may be achieved. The switching frequency fs of the switching elements Q11 and Q12 is varied thereby.",
        "In this instance, the oscillation and drive circuit 11 inputs a DC voltage E3 of a low voltage obtained by a rectification circuit formed from a rectification diode D3 and a capacitor C3 to the tertiary winding N4 formed on the primary side of the insulating converter transformer PIT so as to use the DC voltage E3 as an operation power supply. Further, the rectified smoothed voltage Ei is inputted through a starting resistor RS to start the oscillation and drive circuit 11.",
        "FIG. 23 is a view showing operation waveforms of principal components of the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 21.",
        "It is to be noted that also the operation waveforms of the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 22 are substantially similar to the operation waveforms of FIG. 23.",
        "First, if the commercial AC power supply is made available and starting current is supplied, for example, through the starting resistor RS1 to the base of the switching element Q1 to turn on the switching element Q1, then the switching element Q2 is controlled so as to be turned off. Then, as an output of the switching element Q1, resonance current flows along the primary winding N1\u2192primary side series resonance capacitor C1, and the switching elements Q1 and Q2 are controlled such that the switching element Q2 is turned on while the switching element Q1 is turned off in the proximity of a point of time when the resonance current becomes equal to zero. Thereafter, the switching elements Q1 and Q2 are controlled so as to be alternately turned on.",
        "Consequently, within a period TON within which the switching element Q2 is on and another period TOFF within which the switching element Q2 is off, the collector-emitter voltage VQ2 of the switching element Q2 has such a waveform as shown in (a) of FIG. 23, and switching current IQ2 having such a waveform as shown in (b) of FIG. 23 flows to the collector of the switching element Q2.",
        "Further, though not shown here, the collector-emitter voltage of the switching element Q1 and the switching current flowing to the switching element Q1 side have waveforms having a phase difference by 180\u00b0 from the collector-emitter voltage VQ2 and the switching current IQ2 of the switching element Q2, respectively. In short, the switching elements Q1 and Q2 perform switching at timings at which they are turned on/off alternately.",
        "In response to the switching operations of the switching elements Q1 and Q2, the primary side series resonance current I1 flowing to the primary side series resonance capacitor C1 has a sine waveform according to the switching period as shown in (c) of FIG. 23. In short, the primary side series resonance current I1 has a resonant waveform according to the current resonance type. An alternating voltage is excited also in the secondary winding N2 by an alternating voltage generated in accordance with current flowing through the primary winding N1.",
        "Then, in response to the alternating voltage generated in the secondary winding N2 in such a manner as described above, such a waveform as shown in (e) of FIG. 23 is obtained as that of an inter-terminal voltage V2 between the input terminal of the positive electrode side and the input terminal of the negative electrode side of the bridge rectification circuit DBR connected to the secondary winding N2.

Here, the characteristics under the conditions of the AC input voltage VAC=100 V and the load power Po=0 W to 125 W are shown.",

In particular, although the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) in this instance is, for example, approximately 92% when the load power Po is Po=125 W, when the load power Po ix Po=50 W, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) drops to approximately 89%, and when the load power Po is Po=25 W, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) further drops to approximately 82.5%.

        "According to the configuration of the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 25, when the load power Po is Po=25 W, resonance current of the positive polarity is caused to flow by the leakage inductance component L1l (L1l=42 \u03bcH) of the primary winding N1 and the capacitance of the primary side series resonance capacitor C1, and the period B within which power transmission to the load side is performed becomes shorter. Then, the power non-transmission period A within which sawtooth waveform current of the negative polarity is caused to flow by the exciting inductance L1 (L1=165 \u03bcH) of the primary winding N1 becomes longer. As a result, with the power supply circuit of the configuration shown in FIG. 25, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) in a low load condition drops.",

        "Incidentally, with a power supply circuit constructed as a current resonance type converter of the half bridge type so as to obtain a DC input voltage by means of a full-wave rectification circuit, there is a limitation to enhancement of the power conversion efficiency. More particularly, the load power with which a power conversion efficiency of approximately 92% can be assured is approximately 120 W in the maximum. For example, within a range of the load power of 125 W to 150 W in a heavier load condition, the power conversion efficiency is equal to or lower than 92%.",
        "Therefore, if it is tried to obtain a higher power conversion efficiency with a power supply circuit which can cope with, for example, maximum load power of 150 W or more, then the power supply circuit is configured so as to obtain a DC input voltage by means of a voltage doubler rectification circuit as shown in FIG. 21. By the configuration, the power conversion efficiency can be enhanced to approximately 93%. However, in this instance, it is necessary to incorporate two smoothing capacitors in the voltage doubler rectification circuit, and the part cost becomes higher as the voltage withstanding property of the switching elements Q1 and Q2 and the resonance capacitors increases.",
        "Further, as a problem common to the related art power supply circuits described above, particularly the power conversion efficiency drops as the load power decreases.",
        "For example, taking the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 25 as an example, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) is approximately 89% when the load power Po is Po=50 W and approximately 82.5% when the load power Po is Po=25 W. Also in a no-load condition wherein the load power Po is Po=0 W, the AC input power is approximately 4.2 W.",

Further, the numbers of turns of the primary winding and the secondary winding are selected such that the induced voltage per one turn of the secondary winding is set to a voltage with which secondary side current to flow through the secondary side of the converter transformer exhibits a continuous operation mode.

        "In this instance, since a switching output obtained at the resonance current detection winding NA of the drive transformer PRT is induced in the driving windings NB1 to NB4 through a transformer coupling, an alternating voltage as a drive voltage is generated in the driving windings NB1 to NB4. This drive voltage is outputted as drive current from each series resonance circuit which forms a self-oscillation drive circuit to the base of the switching elements Q1 to Q4 through the base current limiting resistors RB1 to RB4. Consequently, each of the switching elements Q1 to Q4 performs switching operation in a switching frequency determined by the resonance frequency of the series resonance circuit.",
        "The insulating converter transformer PIT transmits the switching outputs of the switching elements Q1 to Q4 to the secondary side.",
        "The primary winding N1 of the insulating converter transformer PIT is connected at one end thereof to a node between the emitter of the switching element Q1 and the collector of the switching element Q2 through the series resonance capacitor C1 and the resonance current detection winding NA. The primary winding N1 is connected at the other end thereof to a node between the emitter of the switching element Q3 and the collector of the switching element Q4. Consequently, a switching output is obtained at the primary winding N1 as the set of the switching elements Q1 and Q4 and the set of the switching elements Q2 and Q3 alternately perform switching operation.",
        "Further, the capacitance of the series resonance capacitor C1 and the leakage inductance component of the insulating converter transformer PIT including the inductance component of the primary winding N1 form a primary side series resonance circuit for making operation of the primary side switching converter as that of the current resonance type.",
        "In this manner, with the primary side switching converter shown in the figure, operation of the current resonance type and partial voltage resonance operation described above are obtained compositely.",
        "The switching operation of the present power supply circuit is, for example, such as follows.",
        "First, if the commercial AC power supply AC is made available, then base current for starting is supplied to the base of the switching elements Q1 to Q4, for example, through the starting resistors RS1 to RS4. Here, since voltages of the opposite polarities to each other are excited, for example, in the driving windings NB1 and NB4 and the driving windings NB2 and NB3 of the drive transformer PRT, if the switching elements Q1 and Q4 are turned on first, then the switching elements Q2 and Q3 are controlled so as to be turned off. Then, the self-oscillation driving circuits of the switching elements Q1 to Q4 perform self-oscillation operation by resonance operation using the alternating voltages excited in the driving windings NB1 to NB4 as sources. Consequently, the set of the switching elements Q1 and Q4 and the set of the switching elements Q2 and Q3 are controlled so as to be turned on/off alternately. In other words, they perform switching operation.",
        "Then, for example, when the switching elements Q1 are Q4 are on, resonance current flows, as a switching output of the switching elements Q1 and Q4, to the primary winding N1 and the primary side series resonance capacitor C1 through the resonance current detection winding NA. Then, in the proximity of a point of time at which the resonance current becomes \u201c0\u201d, the switching elements Q1 and Q4 are turned off and the switching elements Q2 and Q3 are turned on. Consequently, resonance current flows in the opposite direction through the switching elements Q2 and Q3. Thereafter, self-excited switching operation wherein the set of the switching elements Q1 and Q4 and the switching elements Q2 and Q3 are alternately turned on by ZVS and ZCS is repeated. Further, when the switching elements Q1 to Q4 perform turn-on/off operation, current flows through the primary side partial voltage resonance capacitors Cp1 and Cp2 within a short period of time upon turning on and turning off of the switching elements Q1 to Q4. In other words, partial resonance operation is obtained.",
        "Although a detailed structure is hereinafter described, a gap G of 1.5 mm or more is formed in a central magnetic leg of a core which forms the insulating converter transformer PIT. Thus, the primary winding N1 and the secondary windings N2 and N3 are wound on the core having such a structure as just described such that the coupling coefficient k between the primary winding N1 and the secondary windings N2 and N3 is, for example, 0.84 or less and exhibits a loose coupling state.",

A secondary side DC output voltage E01 is obtained across the smoothing capacitor C01 by full-wave rectification operation of the full-wave rectification circuit. The secondary side DC output voltage E01 is supplied to a load not shown. Further, the secondary side DC output voltage E01 is branched and inputted also as a detection voltage to the control circuit 1 as seen in the figure.",
        "Further, on the secondary side, the secondary winding N3 is wound further. The secondary winding N3 is connected at a center tap point thereof to the secondary side ground. Further, the secondary winding N3 is connected at one end thereof to the anode of a diode D01 and at the other end thereof to another diode D02.",
        "The cathodes of the diodes D01 and D02 are connected to the positive electrode side of the smoothing capacitor C02 thereby to form a full-wave rectification smoothing circuit to obtain a secondary side DC output voltage E02 which is, for example, a low voltage.",
        "The control circuit 1 varies the control current (DC current) level to be supplied to the control winding NC in response to a level variation of the secondary side DC output voltage E01 to variably control the inductances LB1 to LB4 of the driving windings NB1 to NB4 wound on the drive transformer PRT. Consequently, the resonance condition of a series resonance circuit in each self-oscillation driving circuit is varied by the switching elements Q1 to Q4 formed including the inductances LB1 to LB4 of the driving windings NB1 to NB4 to vary the switching frequency of the switching elements Q1 to Q4 to achieve stabilization of the secondary side DC output voltage.",
        "The structure of the insulating converter transformer PIT is a structure shown, for example, as a sectional view of FIG. 19 or FIG. 20, that is, a structure having a pair of E-E type cores or a pair of U-U type cores.",
        "FIG. 19 shows an example of a structure which uses a pair of E-type cores.",
        "As a core of the insulating converter transformer PIT, an E-E type core is formed by combining two E type cores CR1 and CR2 such that end portions of magnetic legs thereof are opposed to each other as seen in the figure. Further, in this instance, a gap G of 1.5 mm or more is formed between the opposing faces of the central magnetic legs of the E type cores CR1 and CR2.",
        "It is to be noted that, for example, a ferrite material is used for the E type cores CR1 and CR2.",

Further, the number of turns of the secondary winding N2 is selected so that the induced voltage per one turn of the secondary winding N2 may be equal to or less than 3 V/T (for example, 1.8 V/T) under the condition described. Consequently, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) in a low load state wherein the load is, for example, approximately 5% of a maximum load power (for example, 200 W) is achieved.",

        "It is to be noted that, when to obtain the measurement results illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3, part elements of the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 1 are selected in the following manner.",
        "First, as regards the insulating converter transformer PIT, the gap G is set to G=1.5 mm to select the coupling coefficient k=0.81. Further, the primary winding N1=20 T, secondary winding N2=75 T, exciting inductance L1=95 \u03bcH, leakage inductance L1l=32 \u03bcH, exciting inductance L2=950 \u03bcH, and leakage inductance L2l=318 \u03bcH are selected. Further, the primary side series resonance capacitor C1=0.092 \u03bcF is selected.",
        "As seen in FIG. 2, operation of the switching elements Q1 to Q4 of the power supply circuit is indicated by the collector-emitter voltage VQ1 of the switching element Q1 illustrated in (a) of the figure, switching current IQ1 and IQ4 illustrated in (c) of the figure and the switching current IQ2 and IQ3 illustrated in (d) of the figure. In this instance, the switching elements Q1 and Q4 perform switching operation such that they exhibit an on state within a period TON and exhibit an off state within a period TOFF.",
        "Here, if the switching elements Q1 and Q4 are turned on, then resonance current flows along a path of the switching element Q1\u2192primary side series resonance capacitor C1\u2192primary winding N1\u2192switching element Q4. Then, the switching elements Q1 to Q4 are controlled such that the switching elements Q2 and Q3 are turned on and the switching elements Q1 and Q4 are turned off in the proximity of a point of time at which the resonance current becomes equal to zero. Consequently, the resonance current flows along a path of the switching element Q3\u2192primary winding N1\u2192primary side series resonance capacitor C1\u2192switching element Q2. Thereafter, the switching elements Q1 to Q4 are controlled such that the switching elements Q1 and Q4 and the switching elements Q2 and Q3 are turned on alternately.",

Further, though not shown in the figure, also through the primary side partial voltage resonance capacitor Cp2 connected to the switching element Q4, partial resonance current flows within a short period of time within which the switching element Q4 is turned on or turned off.",
        "Consequently, switching current IQ1 and IQ4 flowing through the collector-emitter of the switching elements Q1 and Q4 has such a waveform as illustrated in (c) of FIG. 2. Further, the switching current IQ2 and IQ3 flowing through the switching elements Q2 and Q3 has a waveform having a phase displaced by 180 degrees from that of the switching current IQ1 and IQ4 and has such a waveform as shown in (d) of FIG. 2.",
        "In this instance, the primary side series resonance current I1 flowing through the primary side series resonance capacitor C1 has such a sine waveform as shown in (e) of FIG. 2, and the primary side series resonance current I1 in the negative direction flows through the switching element Q1 while the primary side series resonance current I1 in the positive direction flows through the switching element Q2. In other words, drive current having a waveform proximate to a resonance current waveform is supplied to the primary winding N1 connected in series to the primary side series resonance capacitor C1 as the set of the switching elements Q1 to Q4 and the set of the switching elements Q2 and Q3 perform on/off operations alternately. An alternating voltage is excited also in the secondary winding N2 by an alternating voltage generated in response to the current flowing through the primary winding N1.",
        "Then, the inter-terminal voltage V2 between the positive side input terminal and the negative side input terminal of the bridge rectification circuit DBR connected to the secondary winding N2 is obtained with such a waveform as shown in (f) of FIG. 2 in response to the alternating voltage generated in the secondary winding N2 in such a manner as described above. In short, a waveform which is clamped at the absolute value level of the rectified smoothed voltage E0 within a period within which rectification current flows through the bridge rectification circuit DBR is obtained.",
        "Current ID having such a waveform as shown in (g) of FIG. 2 is outputted from the bridge rectification circuit DBR. In this instance, a continuous operation mode wherein the secondary side current ID flows continuously to the bridge rectification circuit DBR is exhibited as seen from (g) of FIG. 2.",
        "Here, for example, in the related art power supply circuits shown in FIGS. 21 and 22, a so-called discontinuous operation mode is exhibited wherein the secondary side current ID flows to the bridge rectification circuit DBR on the secondary side only within a series resonance period between the leakage inductance component L1l of the primary winding N1 of the insulating converter transformer PIT and the primary side series resonance capacitor C1.",
        "In this instance, since the power non-transmission period increases as the load becomes lighter, even if the load power Po decreases, the primary side series resonance current I1 does not decrease and also the switching output current IQ1 and IQ2 flowing through the switching elements Q1 and Q2 does not decrease as described hereinabove. As a result, in the related art power supply circuits, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) drops as the load power Po decreases as illustrated in FIG. 24.",
        "In contrast, in the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 1, as the load power Po decreases, the leakage inductance component L1l of the primary winding N1 and the leakage inductance L2l of the secondary winding N2 of the insulating converter transformer PIT increase when compared with those of the related art power supply circuits, and the secondary side current ID flowing through the bridge rectification circuit DBR exhibits a continuous operation mode as shown in (g) of FIG. 2.",
        "As a result, since the primary side series resonance current I1 flowing to the primary winding N1 can be decreased as the load power Po decreases, it is possible to achieve reduction of the power loss on the primary side and achieve enhancement of the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC). As a characteristic of the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC), it can be seen from FIG. 3 that a higher value than that of the characteristic, for example, illustrated as the related art in FIG. 24 is obtained over a substantially overall corresponding load variation range. Particularly, in the present embodiment, for example, up to the load power Po=approximately 50 W, the power conversion efficiency exhibits a tendency that it increases as the load decreases, and also where the load power Po is Po=50 W or less, for example, where the load power Po is Po=25 W, a power conversion efficiency of 92% or more is secured. In short, according to the present embodiment, particularly the problem of the related art that the power conversion efficiency drops as the load decreases is improved excellently.",
        "According to an experiment, while, with the related art power supply circuit shown in FIG. 21, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) at the load power Po=200 W (in a heavy load state) is approximately 91%, with the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 1, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) can be enhanced up to approximately 93.0%.",
        "Further, where the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) of the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 21 and the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) of the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 1 are compared with each other, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) can be enhanced from approximately 92.4% to approximately 93.6% at the load power Po=150 W, from approximately 92.0% to approximately 94.3% at the load power Po=100 W, from approximately 87.0% to 95.0% at the load power Po=50 W, and from approximately 82.0% to approximately 94.0% at the load power Po=25 W.",

        "Further, in the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 1, since the input rectification circuit which forms the input rectification smoothing circuit can be formed from a full-wave rectification circuit, the input rectification smoothing circuit requires only one smoothing capacitor. Further, since the switching element can be formed from a full-bridge coupling, also the voltage withstanding property of the switching elements Q1 to Q4 can be selected within a range from 400 V to 200 V, reduction of the cost of the circuit can be achieved.",
        "Furthermore, since the switching characteristic of the switching elements is enhanced, heat generation by the switching element decreases, and there is an advantage also that the radiator plate for the switching elements can be formed with a reduced size or can be eliminated.",

        "In contrast, the secondary side current ID which flows through the secondary side bridge rectification circuit DBR of the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 5 exhibits a continuous operation mode as seen in (f) of FIG. 6 and (f) of FIG. 7. Further, in this instance, the current waveform of the primary side series resonance current I1 flowing through the primary winding N1 of the insulating converter transformer PIT is a sine waveform, and as a result, the primary side series resonance current I1 drops linearly.",
        "In particular, in the related art power supply circuits, the exciting inductance L1 of the primary winding N1 is L1=165 \u03bcH; the leakage inductance L1l of the primary winding N1 is L1l=41 \u03bcH; the exciting inductance L2 of the secondary winding N2 is L2=171 \u03bcH; and the leakage inductance L2l of the primary winding N2 is L2l=43 \u03bcH, and the secondary side current ID flows only within a series resonance period of the leakage inductance L1l of the primary winding N1 and the primary side series resonance capacitor C1. Therefore, even if the load power Po decreases, the primary side series resonance current I1 does not drop, and the switching output current IQ1 and IQ2 does not drop.",
        "In contrast, with the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 5, as the load power Po decreases, the primary side series resonance current I1 flowing through the primary winding N1 of the insulating converter transformer PIT drops and the switching output current IQ1 and IQ2 drops.

Since the secondary side current ID to flow through the bridge rectification circuit DBR is thereby caused to operate in a continuous operation mode to achieve reduction of the primary side series resonance current I1, for example, even in a light load state wherein the load power Po is approximately 5% of the maximum load power (200 W), enhancement of the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) can be anticipated.",

Here, since voltages of the opposite polarities to each other are excited, for example, in the driving windings NB1 and NB2 of the drive transformer PRT, if it is assumed that the switching element Q1 is turned on first, then the switching element Q2 is controlled so as to be turned off. Then, the self-excited oscillation drive circuits of the switching elements Q1 and Q2 perform self-oscillation operation by resonance operation using alternating voltages excited in the driving windings NB1 and NB2 as sources, respectively. As a result, the switching elements Q1 and Q2 are controlled so as to be turned on/off alternately. In other words, the switching elements Q1 and Q2 perform switching operation.",

Consequently, resonance current in the reverse direction flows through the switching element Q2. Thereafter, the self-excited switching operation wherein the switching elements Q1 and Q2 are turned on alternately by ZVS and ZCS is repeated. Further, when the switching elements Q1 and Q2 perform on/off operation, current flows through the primary side partial voltage resonance capacitor Cp within a short period of time upon turning off of the switching elements Q1 and Q2.

Then, the switching elements Q1 to Q4 are controlled such that the switching elements Q2 and Q3 are turned on and the switching elements Q1 and Q4 are turned off in the proximity of a point of time at which the resonance current becomes equal to zero. Consequently, resonance current now flows along another path of the switching element Q3\u2192primary winding N1\u2192primary side series resonance capacitor C1\u2192switching element Q2. Thereafter, the switching elements Q1 to Q4 are controlled such that the switching elements Q1 and Q4 and the switching elements Q2 and Q3 are turned on alternately.",

Further, though not shown, also to another primary side partial voltage resonance capacitor Cp2 connected to the switching element Q4, partial resonance current flows within a short period within which the switching element Q4 is turned on or turned off.",
        "Further, in the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 11, switching current IQ1 and IQ4 flowing between the collector and the emitter of the switching elements Q1 and Q4 has an M-shaped waveform as seen in (c) of FIG. 12 wherein the current level decreases in the proximity substantially of the center of a period TON within which the switching elements Q1 and Q4 are turned on. Also the switching current IQ2 and IQ3 flowing through the switching elements Q2 and Q3 has such an M-shaped waveform as seen in (d) of FIG. 12 which is displaced by 180 degrees in phase from that of the switching current IQ1 and IQ4.",
        "Accordingly, if the waveforms of the switching current IQ1 to IQ4 shown in (c) and (d) of FIG. 12 and the waveform of the current IQ2 of the power supply circuit as a related art shown in (b) of FIG. 23 are compared with each other, then it can be seen that the peak value of the primary side current of the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 11 exhibits a decrease by an amount provided by the M-shaped waveform of the switching current IQ1 to IQ4.",
        "It arises from the following factors that the switching current IQ1 to IQ4 flowing between the collector and the emitter of the switching elements Q1 to Q4 of the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 11 has an M-shaped waveform in this manner.",
        "First, as regards the configuration, the gap G of the insulating converter transformer PIT is expanded from the conventional one to achieve decrease of the coupling coefficient k. Further, the number of turns of the secondary winding N2 is selected so that an induced voltage V2 per one turn of the secondary winding N2 may be, for example, 5.9 V/T (=135 V/23 T) or more. Furthermore, the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C2 is connected in parallel to the secondary winding N2.",
        "As a result, by a partial voltage resonance action of the capacitance of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C2 and the leakage inductance L2l of the secondary winding N2, a period within which the partial voltage resonance current IC2 flows through the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C2 is obtained within a period within which the rectification current ID is off. In this instance, the partial voltage resonance current IC2 flows within a period within which the rectification diode which forms the bridge rectification circuit DBR on the secondary side is turned off and the rectification current ID does not flow as seen from (f) and (h) of FIG. 12. In this instance, the current flowing through the secondary winding N2 is composite current of the rectification current ID and the partial voltage resonance current IC2, and the composite current waveform exhibits an M shape. Consequently, also the series resonance current flowing through the primary winding N1 which is magnetically coupled to the secondary winding N2 has an M-shaped waveform.",
        "In this instance, the primary side series resonance current I1 in the positive polarity direction flows through the switching elements Q1 and Q4 while the primary side series resonance current I1 in the negative pole direction flows through the switching elements Q2 and Q3. In other words, when the set of the switching elements Q1 and Q4 and the set of the switching elements Q2 and Q3 exhibit turning on/off alternately, drive current having a waveform proximate to a resonance current waveform is supplied to the primary winding N1 connected in series to the primary side series resonance capacitor C1. Then, an alternating voltage is excited also in the secondary winding N2 by an alternating voltage generated in response to the current flowing through the primary winding N1.",
        "Then, the inter-terminal voltage V2 obtained between the positive electrode side input terminal and the negative electrode side input terminal of the bridge rectification circuit DBR connected to the secondary winding N2 is obtained with such a waveform as shown in (g) of FIG. 12 in accordance with the alternating voltage generated in the secondary winding N2 in such a manner as described above. In short, a waveform which is clamped at the absolute value level of the rectified smoothed voltage E0 within a period within which rectification current flows through the bridge rectification circuit DBR.",
        "Further, rectification current ID having such a waveform as shown in (h) of FIG. 12 is outputted from the bridge rectification circuit DBR. Further, since, in the proximity of the zero cross at which the induced voltage V2 generated in the bridge rectification circuit DBR exhibits the zero level, such partial voltage resonance current IC2 as illustrated in (f) of FIG. 12 flows through the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C2, the rectification current ID on the secondary side exhibits a discontinuous mode. However, from the primary side of the insulating converter transformer PIT, it looks that current according to a continuous mode flows through the secondary winding.",
        "Further, the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 11 is controlled such that the switching frequency fs decreases as the load power Po becomes heavier as seen in FIG. 13. In short, it can be recognized that constant voltage control of the secondary side DC output voltage E01 is performed through switching frequency control.",
        "More particularly, in the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 11, the gap G of the insulating converter transformer PIT is expanded from 1.0 mm of the conventional example to 2.0 mm to decrease the coupling coefficient k from 0.87 to 0.81. Then, the induced voltage V2 per one turn of the secondary winding N2 is set to V2=5.9 V/T and the capacitance value of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C2 is selectively set to 3300 pF.",
        "In this manner, in the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 11, while the current flowing on the secondary side of the insulating converter transformer PIT exhibits a discontinuous mode, in this instance, also the waveform of the primary side series resonance current I1 flowing through the primary side series resonance capacitor C1 can be made an M-shaped waveform by a partial voltage resonance action of the capacitance of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C2 and the leakage inductance L2l of the secondary winding N2. Thus, also the current waveform of the switching current IQ1 to IQ4 flowing through the switching elements Q1 to Q4 can be made an M-shaped waveform.",
        "Consequently, the peak level of the primary side series resonance current I1 and IQ1 to IQ4 flowing on the primary side within the range of the load power Po of Po=200 W to 0 W can be lowered, and enhancement of the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) at the load power Po=200 W to 0 W can be achieved.",

Further, also the input power in a no-load state wherein the load power Po is Po=0 W can be reduced from approximately 3.5 W to approximately 1.7 W.",
        "As a result, when compared with the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 21, the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 11 can achieve reduction of the AC input power by approximately 4.8 W at the load power Po=200 W, by approximately 2.0 W at the load power Po=150 W, by approximately 2.3 W at the load power Po=100 W, by approximately 3.7 W at the load power Po=50 W, by approximately 3.1 W at the load power Po=25 W, and by approximately 1.8 W at the load power Po=0 W.",
        "Further, in the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 11, since the input rectification circuit which forms the input rectification smoothing circuit can be formed from a full-wave rectification circuit similarly as in the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 1, the input rectification smoothing circuit requires only one smoothing capacitor. Further, since the switching element is formed from a full-bridge coupling, also the voltage withstanding property of the switching elements Q1 to Q4 can be selected within a range from 400 V to 200 V, and consequently, reduction of the cost of the circuit can be achieved. Further, since also the switching characteristics of the switching elements Q1 to Q4 are enhanced, heat generation by the switching elements Q1 to Q4 can be reduced. Consequently, there is an advantage also that the necessity for a heat radiating plate for the switching elements Q1 to Q4 is eliminated.",

        "Also in this instance, a gap G of 1.5 mm or more is formed in the central magnetic leg of the core which forms the insulating converter transformer PIT so that a loose coupling state wherein the coupling coefficient k of the primary winding N1 and secondary winding N2 or N3 is, for example, k=approximately 0.84 or less may be obtained similarly as in the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 5.",
        "Further, a secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C2 is connected in parallel to the secondary winding N2 of the insulating converter transformer PIT such that the capacitance of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C2 and the leakage inductance of the secondary winding N2 form a secondary side partial voltage resonance circuit. Further, in order to obtain an secondary side DC output voltage E01 of approximately 135 V, the number of turns of the secondary winding N2 of the pits is set so that the induced voltage per one turn of the secondary winding N2 may be 5 V or more to achieve enhancement of the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) over a range from a heavy load state (125 W) to a light load state. It is to be noted that, also in this instance, an insulating converter transformer having the configuration of FIG. 19 or FIG. 20 described hereinabove can be applied to the insulating converter transformer PIT.

        "Also in this instance, the current IQ2 which flows through the switching element Q12 has an M-shaped waveform wherein the current level exhibits a decrease in the proximity of the substantially center of a period TON within which the switching element Q12 is on. Though not shown, M-shaped current IQ1 having a phase displaced by 180 degrees from that of the current IQ2 flows also through the switching element Q11.",
        "In this manner, the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 14 achieves increase of the leakage inductance L1l of the primary winding N1 by expanding the gap G of the insulating converter transformer PIT from the conventional one to achieve decrease of the coupling coefficient k. Further, the number of turns of the secondary winding N2 is selected so that the induced voltage per one turn of the secondary winding N2 may be 5 V or more, and the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C2 is connected in parallel to the secondary winding N2.",
        "In this instance, the primary side series resonance current I1 flowing through the primary side series resonance capacitor C1 is provide with such an M-shaped waveform as shown in (d) of FIG. 15 by a parallel resonance action of the capacitance of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C2 and the leakage inductance L1l of the primary winding N1.",

        "Further, the number of turns of the primary winding N1 of the insulating converter transformer PIT is increased from 24 T to 28 T. Consequently, the leakage inductance L1l of the primary winding N1 is increased from 42 \u03bcH to 56 \u03bcH.",
        "Further, as the capacitance value of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C2 in this instance, 1,200 pF is selected.",
        "Further, in this instance, a voltage V1 of a waveform wherein the polarity is reversed between the period TON and the period TOFF as seen in (c) of FIG. 15 is obtained across the primary winding N1 of the insulating converter transformer PIT. Further, since such secondary side rectification current ID as shown in (f) of FIG. 15 flows between the center tap of the secondary winding N2 and the secondary side ground, the inter-terminal voltage V2 between the winding starting end side of the secondary winding N2 and the secondary side ground is obtained as an output of such a waveform as shown in (e) of FIG. 15.",

Also in this instance, the primary side series resonance current I1 flowing through the primary side series resonance capacitor C1 has such a waveform as shown in (d) of FIG. 16 because of a parallel resonance action of the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C2 and the leakage inductance L1l of the primary winding N1.",
        "In this instance, a voltage V1 of such a waveform as shown in (c) of FIG. 16 is obtained across the primary winding N1 of the insulating converter transformer PIT. Further, since such rectification current ID as illustrated in (f) of FIG. 16 flows between the center tap of the secondary winding N2 and the secondary side ground, the induced voltage V2 between the winding starting end side of the secondary winding N2 and the secondary side ground is obtained as an output of such a waveform as shown in (e) of FIG. 16.",

Consequently, the switching output current IQ1 and IQ2 flowing through the switching elements Q1 and Q2 can be provided with an M-shaped waveform.",
        "Consequently, as can be seen from a characteristic diagram of the power supply circuit of FIG. 14 shown in FIG. 17 and the characteristic diagram of the power supply circuit of FIG. 25 shown in FIG. 28, the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 14 exhibits enhancement of the power conversion efficiency over the range of the load power Po=0 W to 125 W. It can be seen that the power conversion efficiency is enhanced particularly where the load is light.",
        "According to an experiment, while, with the related art power supply circuit shown in FIG. 25, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) at the load power Po=125 W is approximately 92.0%, with the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 14, the AC-DC power conversion efficiency (\u03b7AC\u2192DC) can be enhanced up to approximately 93.1%.",

Further, also the input power in a no-load state wherein the load power Po is Po=0 W can be reduced from approximately 4.2 W to approximately 1.7 W.",
        "As a result, when compared with the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 25, the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 14 can achieve reduction of the AC input power by approximately 1.6 W at the load power Po=125 W, by approximately 2.0 W at the load power Po=100 W, by approximately 1.7 W at the load power Po=75 W, by approximately 1.9 W at the load power Po=50 W, by approximately 1.2 W at the load power Po=25 W, and by approximately 2.5 W at the load power Po=0 W.",
        "Further, as shown in FIG. 17, the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 14 is controlled such that the switching frequency fs becomes lower as the load power Po becomes heavier. In other words, the switching frequency fs has a proportionally rising tendency as the switching frequency fs becomes lighter.",
        "Thus, for example, the control range of the switching frequency fs with respect to the variation of the load power Po=125 W to 25 W of the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 14 is from approximately 61.7 kHz to 64.9 kHz.",
        "In contrast, the control range of the switching frequency fs with respect to the variation of the load power Po=125 W to 25 W of the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 25 is from approximately 62.5 kHz to 65.8 kHz. Accordingly, in the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 14 and the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 25, the control ranges of the switching frequency fs with respect to the variation of the load power Po=125 W to 25 W are substantially equal to each other.",
        "Further, while the control range of the switching frequency fs with respect to an input voltage variation (85 V to 140 V) of the AC input voltage VAC at the load power Po=125 W is from approximately 52.1 kHz to 76.9 kHz with the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 25, but is from approximately 58.8 kHz to 74.6 kHz with the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 14. Accordingly, the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 14 has an advantage that the control range of the switching frequency fs with respect to the input voltage variation at the load power Po=125 W is smaller by approximately 9 kHz.",
        "A switching power supply circuit as a sixth embodiment of the present invention is described. It is to be noted that the power supply circuit of the sixth embodiment has a circuit configuration same as that of the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 10, and therefore, the power supply circuit of the sixth embodiment is omitted in the drawings.",
        "However, in the power supply circuit described hereinabove with reference to FIG. 10, in order to prevent abnormal oscillation operation in a low load condition to achieve stable operation, the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C2 is connected in parallel to the secondary winding N2. However, in the power supply circuit according to the sixth embodiment, the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C2 is provided in order to artificially obtain a continuous operation mode in which the secondary side current flowing through the secondary side of the insulating converter transformer PIT flows continuously. In short, also the sixth embodiment has a configuration which includes the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C2 for obtaining operation and action similar to those of the fourth and fifth embodiments described hereinabove.",

        "Further, since the switching operation described above is obtained, the primary winding current I1 of a waveform shown in (d) of FIG. 18 flows through the primary winding N1. The primary winding current I1 has a waveform whose polarity is reversed in accordance with the switching period such that it has the positive polarity within the period TON but has the negative polarity within the period TOFF as seen in the figure.",
        "Further, the inter-terminal voltage V1 of the primary winding N1 at this time has such a waveform as shown in (c) of FIG. 18.",
        "Meanwhile, on the secondary side of the power supply circuit, such secondary side current ID as shown in (g) of FIG. 18 flows between the center tap of the secondary winding N2 and the secondary side ground, and the voltage V2 of such a waveform as shown in (e) of FIG. 18 is obtained between the winding starting end side of the secondary winding N2 and the secondary side ground.

Furthermore, the partial voltage resonance current IC2 of such a waveform as shown in (h) of FIG. 18 flows through the secondary side partial voltage resonance capacitor C2 connected in parallel to the secondary winding N2.",
        "Thus, since also the power supply circuit as the sixth embodiment having such a configuration as described above has characteristics similar to those of FIG. 17, enhancement of the power conversion efficiency over a range from a light load condition to a heavy load (200 W) condition, which is an effect similar to that of the power supply circuit shown in FIG. 14, can be achieved.",
        "It is to be noted that, in the switching power supply circuits as the fourth to sixth embodiments described above, as regards the number of turns of the secondary winding N2 of the insulating converter transformer PIT, the number of turns of the secondary winding N2 or the primary winding N1 is selected so that the induced voltage per one turn of the secondary winding N2 may be approximately 5.9 V/T or 5.87 V/T. However, if the number of turns of the primary winding N1 or the secondary winding N2 is selected so that the induced voltage per one turn of the secondary winding N2 may be approximately 5 V/T, then the effects described above are achieved.",
        "It is to be noted that, while the power supply circuits of the embodiments described above have a configuration which keeps the secondary side DC output voltage as a constant voltage through the switching frequency control as a constant voltage control section, they may otherwise have a different configuration for constant voltage control, for example, which includes a series regulator.",
        "Furthermore, a power supply circuit based on the concept of the present invention can achieve intended action and effects even if the configuration for keeping the secondary side DC output voltage as a constant voltage is omitted. Accordingly, when to construct the power supply circuit based on the present invention, it can be said that it is not always necessary to provide the configuration for keeping the secondary side DC output voltage as a constant voltage.",

On the contrary, although, as regards the power supply circuits which include the half-bridge system by two switching elements, only a configuration of the separately excited type as in the case of the second embodiment is described, they may otherwise be formed as those of the self-excited type."
