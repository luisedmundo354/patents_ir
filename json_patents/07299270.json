A second link weighting process determines the strength of at least a second link between the second non-directly linked Internet object and the common object. An inferred relation weight calculation process calculates the strength of the inferred relation based on the strength of the at least a first link and the at least a second link.",

Unfortunately, as the number of web sites offering quality information and the quantity of information itself continues to grow, the Internet becomes more difficult to navigate.",
        "The Internet, sometimes simply called the \u201cNet\u201d, is a worldwide system of computer networks. That is, a network of networks in which users at any one computer can, if they have permission, get information from any other computer. Search engines are commonly used to search the web. Users of these search engines can submit their requests in the form of \u201cqueries\u201d. Whenever a user submits one of these queries to a search engine, a list of results is generated which includes hyperlinks that connect each search result to the appropriate Internet document.",
        "The way in which these documents are ranked within the list of results (in relation to the query) is constantly evolving as the Internet continues to evolve. Initially, Internet search engines simply examined the number of times that a query search term appeared within the document, wherein the greater the number of times that a search term appeared, the more relevant the document was considered and the higher it was ranked within the list of results. Please realize that this method ranks documents in accordance with their relevance to the topic of the query.",
        "More advanced ranking methods examine the quality of the documents themselves independent of the topic or query. Specifically, the number of links coming into a document and the number of links leaving that document are examined. Those documents that have a considerable number of documents linked to them are considered information authorities and those documents that are linked to a considerable number of documents are considered information hubs. Naturally, the greater the number of these links, the higher the quality (and ranking) of the document. As this method merely ranks the quality of the document and is topic independent, a topic dependant ranking method (such as the one described above) is typically utilized in conjunction with this quality-ranking method.",
        "In an effort to further enhance the relevance of the list of documents generated in response to a query, search engines examine the words of the query entered and compare them to previous queries entered which included the same words. Naturally, this is a topic-dependant relevance ranking method that allows the search engine to further predict (or suggest) what additional search terms the user might want to include in the query.",

Search engines allow the user to enter a query and perform a search based on that query. A list of potential matches is then generated that provides links to potentially relevant documents. Portals typically offer to the user some form of index that allows the user to manually select the information they wish to retrieve. Typically, portals also offer some form of searching capability and search engines also offer some form indexing capability.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown user 10 accessing the Internet via some form of network 12 that is connected to Internet server 14. These Internet servers 14 serve web pages and Internet-based documents 16 to users 10. Internet server 14 typically incorporates some form of database 18 to store and serve documents 16.",
        "When user 10 wishes to search for information on a specific topic, user 10 utilizes search engine (or portal) 20 running on search engine server 22. User 10 enters query 24 into search engine 20, which provides a list 26 of potential sources for information related to the topic of query 24. For example, if user 10 entered the query \u201cSaturn Car\u201d, list 26 would be generated which enumerates a series of documents that might provide information relating to the query entered. Each entry 28 on list 26 is a hyperlink to a specific relevant document (or web page) 16 on the Internet. These documents 16 may be located on search engine server 22, Internet server 14, or any other server on the Internet.",
        "Search engine 20 determines the ranking of these entries 28 on list 26 by examining the documents themselves to determine certain factors, such as: the number of documents linked to each document; the number of documents that document is linked to; the presence of the query terms within the document itself; etc. This will result in a score (not shown) being generated for each entry, wherein these entries are ranked within list 26 in accordance with these scores.",
        "Now referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, there is shown search engine (or portal) 20 that analyzes the hundreds of millions of documents 16 available to users of the Internet. These documents can be stored locally on server 22 or on any other server or combination of servers connected to network 12. As stated above, when search engine 20 provides list 26 to user 10 in response to query 24 being entered into search engine 20, the individual entries in list 26 will be arranged in accordance with their perceived level of relevance (or match). This relevance level is determined in a number of different ways, each of which examines the relationship between various Internet objects.",
        "As a query contains specific search terms (e.g., \u201cSaturn Car\u201d), early search engines used to simply examine the number of times that these search terms appeared within the documents scanned by the search engine. Web designers typically incorporate hidden metatags into their web documents to bolster the position of their web page on list 26. Metatags simply are lines of code that redundantly recite the specific search terms that, if searched for by a user, the designer would like their web page to be listed high in the list 26 of potentially matching documents. For example, if a web designer wanted their web page to be ranked high in response to the query \u201cSaturn Car\u201d, the designer may incorporate a metatag that recites the words \u201cSaturn\u201d and \u201ccar\u201d 100 times each. Therefore, when the search engine scans this document (which is typically done off line and not in response to a search by a user), the large number of occurrences of the words \u201cSaturn\u201d and \u201ccar\u201d will be noted and stored in the search engine's database. Accordingly, when a user enters this query into search engine 20, the document that contains this metatag will be highly ranked on this list. As easily realized, since the method of ranking simply examines the number of times a specific term appears in a document, the method does not in any way gauge the quality of the document itself.",
        "Search engines are commonly used to search the web. These search engines send automated information-gathering computer programs called \u201cspiders\u201d all across the web to seek out available content. These programs \u201ccrawl\u201d across the web (by following links from site to site) and index each site they visit. Each search engine uses its own set of criteria to decide what to include in its database. For example, some search engines index each page in a web site, while others index only one page.",
        "After collecting the documents, these search engines build an internal representation of them. When a user types in a query, this internal representation is used to quickly find the documents that contain these words. For each word, all documents (from the set returned by the spiders) that contain that word are identified and stored. When users type in the query terms, the search engines scan the list of words to find all documents that contain all terms in the query (i.e., \u201cSaturn\u201d and \u201ccar\u201d).",
        "Different search engines use different techniques to order the resulting lists. Usually simple statistical measures are used to compute the final score of a document with respect to a given query. The final score (or relevancy score) for each document is computed using the frequency of occurrence of the query term (or terms) in the document, its position within the document, and other various factors.",
        "As easily realized, since this method of ranking simply examines the number of times a specific term appears in a document, the method does not in any way gauge the quality of the document itself.",
        "In response to this shortcoming, search engines started exploring ways to measure the quality of a document by examining link information. A good indicator of the quality of a specific document is the number of documents that link to that specific document and the number of documents that specific document is linked to. This leads to a recursive definition in which the quality of a document depends on the quality of links that point to it.",
        "Some search engines also started examining the click popularity of a document to detect and identify high quality document. Click popularity is a measure of the number of clicks received by each document in a search engine's results page. The assumption is that a good quality document for a given topic gets a lot of user clicks when it is returned as an item in the results set. Similarly, poor quality documents get relatively few user clicks.",
        "Search engines also make use of query refinement techniques to further enhance their document ranking accuracy. These search engines compare stored queries (query-to-query relationships) to make suggestions to the user concerning modifications (or supplemental search terms) that would better tailor to the user's query to the specific information they are searching for. For example, if user 10 entered the query \u201cSaturn\u201d into search engine 20, it is unclear in which direction the user intends this search to proceed, as the word \u201cSaturn\u201d is indicative of a planet, a car company, and a home video game system. Using data collected from queries issued by previous users, search engine 20 can make an inquiry such as \u201cAre you looking for information concerning: the planet Saturn; the car Saturn; or the video game system Saturn?\u201d Depending on which selection user 10 makes, the user's search can be tailored accordingly. This further allows search engine 20 to return a relevant list of documents in response to the query being entered by user 10.",
        "Please realize that both search engines and portals utilize the above listed sorting and ranking methods. While the discussion was primarily focused on queries and search engines, portals utilize these methods to determine the placement of documents within their indices.",
        "Unfortunately, all of these various ranking criteria require the preexistence of a relationship between a query and a query, a query and a document, or a document and a document. Accordingly, if search engine 20 needed to rank the relevance of a link to document D1 in relation to query Q2 (an inferred relation) and the only information available to search engine 20 is the list of search results generated as a result of user 10 entering query Q1, search engine 20 would be unable to calculate such a relevance using the above-listed methods. While a quality rating is available for document D1, there is no information available concerning the relevance of document D1 in relation to query Q2.",
        "Inferred relation weighting process 32 is capable of determining the strength of inferred relation 34 between a first Internet object (query Q2) and a second Internet object (document D1), wherein an Internet object is either a document, a query, or an ecommerce transaction record (transaction record T1) and an inferred relation is a relation between Internet objects which are not directly linked. Further, while the above-described ranking methods examine query-query relationships, document-document relationships, or query-document relationships, inferred relation weighting process 32 is uniquely capable of examining all of these relationships when determining the strength of this inferred relation 34. Accordingly, inferred relation weighting process 32 provides a unified framework to simultaneously exploit all types of known relations to infer unknown relations. Further, during this process, inferred relation weighting process 32 may refine/revise known relations.",
        "A transaction record is merely a record of an ecommerce transaction. Just as queries can be cross referenced to demonstrate which query search terms are most often searched together, transaction records can be cross-referenced to show products that are commonly purchased together. Examples of these related products are: flashlights and batteries; shoes and socks; computer printers and paper; etc. Further, just as a link weight can be determined between a query and a document, a link weight can also be determined between a query and a transaction record. For example, a user issued a query Q1 and after visiting a first Internet document D1 (an ecommerce web page) that came up as a search result, the user made an online purchase which resulted in the generation of transaction record T1. Therefore, link weights can be determined between Q1 and D1, D1 and T1, and Q1 and T1.",
        "Please note that there are two additional inferred relations 33 and 35 that would connect Q1 to Q2 and Q1 to D2 respectively. Depending on the objects specified to be analyzed, inferred relation weighting process 32 is capable of determining the strength of these inferred relations when the strength of inferred relation 34 is calculated.",
        "Inferred relation weighting process 32 includes first link weighting process 36 that determines the strength of at least a first link 38 between the first non-directly linked Internet object (Q2) and a common object (D2). A second link weighting process 40 determines the strength of at least a second link 42 between the second non-directly linked Internet object (D1) and the common object (D2). While in this particular example, links 38 and 42 are shown as each being one link, if the common object (D2) actually consists of more than one discrete object, it is possible that each Internet object (D1 and Q2) would be connected to multiple discrete objects within common object D2. Therefore, more than one link would be required for each Internet object (Q2 and D1).",
        "Typically, the strength ranking of the links between the common object (D2) and the individual non-linked Internet objects (Q2 and D1) can be in several forms. For example, it can be a relevancy score (or percentage) that varies between 0.00 and 1.00 or a binary relevance that has only two values (0 or 1). Alternatively, it can be in the form of a raw score based on various relevance features (such as the presence of query search terms within the document itself). This score may be normalized to make the calculation more manageable.",
        "To ease in the explanation of the above-stated example, we will use a Boolean relevance link-weighting scheme (link values equal to 0 or 1). However, as stated above, please realize that these links usually have values that vary in relevance between 0.00 and 1.00. Additionally, while common object D2 is shown as being one object, this will vary depending on the documents available.",
        "In order for inferred relation weighting system 32 to determine the strength of inferred relation 34 between two non-directly linked Internet objects, a series of links has to be established which connects these non-linked objects (Q2 and D1). In this example, a link is created between these two objects by utilizing links 38, 42 and common object D2. However, it may take several additional links to connect objects Q2 and D1 if the common object consists of multiple objects (e.g., Q3, D21, D22, and D23) each interconnected with one or more links. In this scenario, object Q2 is connected to object Q3 via link 38\u2032. Object Q3 is then connected to object D23 through either objects D21 or D22, wherein object D23 is connected to object D1 via link 42\u2032. What must be realized is that this scenario, if left unchecked, would allow almost every document on the Internet to be linked to every other document on the Internet by simply jumping through an infinitely high number of discrete links. Accordingly, as the number of links required to link two non-linked objects increases, the relevancy of the inferred relation between these non-linked objects is substantially attenuated. Since it is often desirable to set a limit concerning the maximum number of links (or hops) that can be utilized to link non-directly linked Internet objects, inferred relation weighting process 32 includes a link limitation process 44 for specifying this limit. Typically, the administrator 46 of inferred relation weighting process 32 specifies this limit. This limitation is highly desirable, as the server processing power required to determine the weight of the inferred relation exponentially increases as the number of discrete links analyzed linearly increases.",
        "As stated above, it is possible for common object D2 to consist of multiple discrete objects each interconnected with a discrete link. Since the weight (or strength) of inferred relation 34 (or any other inferred relation) is based on the strength of all links within the group of objects being analyzed, inferred relation weighting process 32 includes an intermediate link weighting process 58 for determining the strength of each discrete link within common object D2. Naturally, the strength of these discrete links, in conjunction with first and second links 38 and 42, will determine the strength of the inferred relations.",
        "For the above-stated example and those that follow, assume that: query Q1 is the word \u201cauto\u201d; query Q2 is the word \u201cSaturn\u201d; documents D1, D3 and D4 are personal auto web pages; and document D2 is a Saturn car dealer's web page. Documents D1, D2, D3 and D4 are documents available somewhere on the Internet and queries Q1 and Q2 are queries that were previously run on search engine/portal 20. These queries are stored in the query records 48 on search engine database 50, wherein the hyperlink lists generated in response to these queries and the statistics concerning the use of these links are also stored in database 50. For the following examples, we will set the maximum number of links allowed to link two non-directly linked Internet objects equal to three. Therefore, via link limitation process 44, administrator 46 would configure inferred relation weighting process 32 to have a link limit of three.",
        "For ease of illustration, this first example is only going to consider objects Q2, D1, and D2. If it was desired to consider all objects in the system (namely Q1, Q2, D1, D2, D3, and D4), the axes of the pertinent matrices could simply be expanded to include the additional objects. To provide a very clear and concise first example, a small group of objects were chosen. In light of the fact that the group of objects selected consists of only three objects, there is only one possible inferred relation, namely inferred relation 34.",
        "Determining the Link Values:",
        "As query Q2 is a previously-issued stored query, by examining query records 48 stored on search engine database 50, it is easily determined that 700 users who issued query Q2 visited document D2. This determination is made by first link weighting process 36, as this is the link between first Internet object Q2 and common object D2. Second link weighting process 40 determines the existence and strength of a second link 42 between second Internet object D1 and common object D2. To simplify this first example, we will set the weight of each known relation equal to one and the weight of each unknown relation equal to zero. Please note that while we could have chosen to utilize a normalized weighting scheme with real statistical or integer-based weights for each link, this would have made the example unduly cumbersome when compared to this Boolean weighting scheme.",
        "Search engine/portal 20 may include an incoming link examination process 52 for determining the total number of Internet objects linked to a particular Internet object. As stated above, the greater this number is, the higher the incoming link value is for the object in question. Search engine/portal 20 may also include a outgoing link examination process 54 for determining the total number of Internet objects the particular Internet object is linked to. Again, the higher this number is, the higher the outgoing link value is for the object in question. These two values (outgoing link value and incoming link value) are indicative of the overall quality value of the object in question. Accordingly, to establish the quality ratings for documents D1 and D2, incoming link examination process 52 and outgoing link examination process 54 determine the number of objects linked to D1 and D2 and the number of objects D1 and D2 are linked to. Accordingly, it is determined that document D1 is linked to document D2.",
        "The link weighting information we have is as follows: link Q2-D2 is a \u201c1\u201d since seven hundred people followed this link; and link D1\u2192D2 is a \u201c1\u201d since there is a one directional link between these documents.

Concerning the above matrix, please realize that the left-most column indicates the starting point of a link and the top-most row indicates the ending point of a link. Accordingly, since link D1\u2192D2 is a mono-directional link from D1 to D2, a \u201c1\u201d is placed only in cell (3,4) as opposed to cells (3,4) and (4,3).",

Limiting the link distances to a length of three, inferred relation weight calculation process 56 will compute the final score (or Link Matrix) between all possible pairs of nodes. Therefore, inferred relation weight calculation process 56 will combine the maximum number of ways we can get from a first node of the system (A) to a second node of the system (B) utilizing one link (or hop), two links (or hops), or three links (or hops).

Usually a decreasing weighting order is preferred so that single hops are given more weight than double hops, double hops are given more weight than triple hops, and so on. For this example, we will use the default values of 1.00, 0.50 and 0.25 respectively. Accordingly, the Link Matrix (node A\u2192node B)=1.00X+0.50Y+0.25Z",

If it is desired to consider all objects in the system (namely Q1, Q2, D1, D2, D3, and D4), the axes of the pertinent matrices could simply be expanded to include the additional objects. To provide a more elaborative and illustrative example, we will demonstrate how inferred relation weighting process 32 determines the value of all inferred relations (33, 34 and 35) within a system simultaneously (as opposed to simply calculating the value of a single inferred relation as in Example 1).",

Additionally, second Internet object D1 is now connected to the common object (the combination of Q1 and D2) with two discrete links, namely link 42 and link 43. As queries Q1 and Q2 are previously-issued stored queries, by examining query records 48 stored on search engine database 50, it is easily determined that 1000 users who issued query Q1 visited document D1 and 700 users who issued query Q2 visited document D2. Accordingly, first link weighting process 36 determines the existence and strength of first link 38, the link that connects first Internet object Q2 with the common object (the combination of Q1 and D2). Further, second link weighting process 40 determines the existence and strength of second link 42 between second Internet object D1 and the common object (the combination of Q1 and D2). Further, in this example, an additional link 43 connects second Internet object D1 and the common object (the combination of Q1 and D2). Therefore, second link weighting process 40 also determines the existence and strength of link 43.",
        "To simplify this second example, we will set the weight of each known relation equal to one and the weight of each unknown relation equal to zero. Please note that while we could have chosen to utilize a normalized weighting scheme with real statistical or integer-based weights for each link, this would have made the example unduly cumbersome when compared to this Boolean weighting scheme.",

Search engine/portal 20 may also include a outgoing link examination process 54 for determining the total number of Internet objects the particular Internet object is linked to. Again, the higher this number is, the higher the outgoing link value is for the object in question. These two values (outgoing link value and incoming link value) are indicative of the overall quality value of the object in question. Accordingly, to establish the quality rankings for documents D1 and D2, incoming link examination process 52 and outgoing link examination process 54 determine the number of objects linked to D1 and D2 and the number of objects D1 and D2 are linked to. Accordingly, it is determined that document D1 is linked to document D2.",

Concerning the above matrix, please realize that the left-most column indicates the starting point of a link and the top-most row indicates the ending point of a link. Accordingly, since link D1\u2192D2 is a mono-directional link from D1 to D2, a \u201c1\u201d is placed only in cell (4,5) as opposed to cells (4,5) and (5,4).",
