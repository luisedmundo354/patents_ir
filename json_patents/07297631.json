        "The present invention relates to the field of electronics, and more particularly to electronic structures including solder layers and related methods.",
        "Solder layers may be used to provide electrical and mechanical coupling between two electronic substrates, such as in flip-chip bonding. In particular, a solder layer may be provided on a conductive pad of an electronic substrate (such as an input/output pad of an integrated circuit substrate), and the solder layer can be used to bond the electronic substrate to a next level of packaging such as a printed circuit board, a ceramic substrate, and/or another integrated circuit device. Accordingly, the solder layer may provide an electrical interconnection between the electronic substrate and the next level of packaging.",
        "More particularly, a solder bump may be provided on a portion of a conductive pad exposed through a via in an insulating layer. In addition, a relatively thin underbump metallurgy (UBM) layer may promote adhesion, provide a plating electrode, and/or provide a routing conductor. An insulating layer on the electronic structure may include a via therein exposing a portion of the conductive pad on which the solder layer is provided. As current flowing in a conventional structure reaches an edge of a solder bump via, a lower resistance of the bump may cause most of the current to turn the corner at the via edge. A non-uniform current density may result, and a non-uniform current density may reduce reliability.",
        "More particularly, a relatively high current density at the via edge may accelerate local electromigration of the solder layer at the via edge. Solder, for example, may be particularly susceptible to electromigration because of its relatively low melting temperature. Diffusion of metal in the solder layer away from the via edge may result in formation of a void in the solder layer adjacent the via edge. The void may block current flow thus forcing the current to travel farther past the via edge before turning toward the solder. Accordingly, a void may grow laterally along an interface between the solder and the conductive pad.",
        "Solder layers may be relatively sensitive to electromigration as discussed, for example, by W. J. Choi et al. in \u201cElectromigration Of Flip Chip Solder Bump On Cu/Ni(V)/Al Thin Film Under Bump Metallization\u201d (Proceedings of the IEEE Electronic Components Technology Conference, 2002). The disclosure of the Choi et al. reference is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.",
        "According to embodiments of the present invention, methods of forming an electronic structure may include forming a seed layer on an electronic substrate, and forming a conductive shunt layer on portions of the seed layer wherein portions of the seed layer are free of the shunt layer. A conductive barrier layer may be formed on the conductive shunt layer opposite the seed layer wherein the shunt layer comprises a first material and wherein the barrier layer comprises a second material different than the first material. Moreover, a solder layer may be formed on the barrier layer opposite the shunt layer wherein the solder layer comprises a third material different than the first and second materials.",
        "After forming the solder layer, portions of the seed layer free of the solder layer may be removed. The shunt layer may include a layer of a metal such as copper, and the conductive shunt layer may have a thickness of at least approximately 0.5 \u03bcm.

        "The conductivity of a conventional underbump metallurgy layer (UBM) is often ignored in flip chip design because the current flow may be substantially parallel to the thickness direction of the UBM and the UBM may account for only 1% of a total bump thickness. In a region of the via 308 in a structure including a conductive shunt layer 313 according to embodiments of the present invention, however, current may be conducted perpendicular to the thickness direction, through the conductive shunt layer 313 along via 308 sidewalls. Here the conductive shunt layer 313 conductivity can aid in reducing a current density of the solder layer 317 adjacent the via 308 edge on the conductive pad 303 and in improving a lifetime of a solder joint.",
        "A current-carrying cross sectional area of a conductive shunt layer 313 according to embodiments of the present invention may be relatively large because it is at the circumference of the cylinder and the conductive shunt layer 313 metal may be more conductive than the solder of solder layer 317. For a via of diameter 150 \u03bcm microns with a conductive shunt layer of 3 \u03bcm thickness, some 31% percent of the current flows in the conductive shunt layer 313. Because lifetime is proportional to inverse square of current density:\n\nMTTF\u221dJ\u22122.\n\na 31% percent reduction in solder current density may result in an 2.1 fold increase in solder bump lifetime.",
        "Conductive shunt layers may thus act as current spreading layers according to embodiments of the present invention. Stated in other words, a conductive shunt layer may spread current across a bottom surface of a solder layer so that current is more evenly distributed across a cross section of the solder layer parallel with the substrate and so that current crowding in the solder layer at a via corner adjacent a line entry to the conductive pad can be reduced. As discussed above, current entering/exiting the solder layer can be spread along via sidewalls and onto a surface of an insulating layer opposite the conductive pad through the conductive shunt layer.",
        "According to additional embodiments of the present invention, current crowding may be reduced by providing a plurality of current paths to a conductive pad on which a solder layer is formed. As shown in FIG. 4A, a conductive pad 401 may be provided on an insulating layer of a substrate, and a conductive trace 403 may provide routing of electrical signals between the conductive pad 401 and another portion of the substrate. In addition, an electrical coupling 405 may provide at least two separate current flow paths between the conductive trace 403 and the conductive pad 401. As discussed above with respect to FIGS. 1A-C and 2A-C, an insulating layer may be provided on the substrate, on the conductive trace 403, and on the conductive pad 401. Moreover, a via may be provided in the insulating layer so that an interior portion 401A of the conductive pad 401 is free of the passivation layer and so that a peripheral portion 401B of the conductive pad 401 is covered by the passivation layer.",

More particularly, the separate current flow paths may be defined by providing a perforation 407 in the electrical coupling 405 between the conductive pad 401 and the conductive trace 403 so that separate current flow paths are provided on either side of the perforation. Moreover, the electrical coupling 405 may be flared to provide contact with a relatively large portion of the conductive pad. While the conductive trace 403 and the electrical coupling 405 are provided with separate reference numbers, it will understood that the electrical coupling may be considered a part of the conductive trace.",
        "By providing the perforation 407 in a center portion of the electrical coupling, a local current flow through the center of the electrical coupling may be blocked so that a more even distribution of current can be provided to a solder layer on the portion 401A of the conductive pad 401 free of the passivation layer. Stated in other words, a peak current density in the solder layer at the via edge may be reduced by including the perforation 407. As shown in FIG. 4A, the perforation 407 may be circular, but the perforation may have other shapes. As shown in FIG. 4B, the perforation 407\u2032 in electrical coupling 405\u2032 may have a slotted shape to provide separate current paths 405A\u2032 and 405B\u2032. More particularly, the perforation 407\u2032 may be flared and/or may have a triangular shape. In an alternative, the separate current paths 405A\u2032 and 405B\u2032 may be viewed as first and second traces extending from the conductive trace 403 to the conductive pad 401.",

For example, if a solder layer according to the present invention is used to bond two substrates, lateral forces (parallel to the substrates) may be applied to the solder layer due, for example, to different thermal expansions of the substrates, and the solder layer may strain to absorb the stress. More particularly, one side of the solder layer on the conductive pad may be subjected to tensile strain, and an opposite side of the solder layer on the conductive pad may be subjected to compressive strain.",
        "As discussed above, a greater current density may result in portions of a solder layer on a conductive pad adjacent a conductive trace providing the electrical interconnection for the pad. Moreover, the greater current density may result in more rapid electromigration and void formation in portions of the solder layer on a conductive pad adjacent a conductive trace providing electrical interconnection for the pad. Accordingly, one or more conductive traces may be coupled to the conductive pad adjacent a portion of the solder layer that is subjected to compressive stress.

In such a situation, it may be beneficial to provide that a conductive trace or traces are coupled to the conductive pad adjacent one or more neutrally strained portions of the solder layer. For example, a solder layer on the interior portion 501A of conductive pad 501 of FIG. 4C may be subjected to alternating compressive and tensile strains applied parallel to the direction of the trace 503. Accordingly, the separate traces 505A and 505B may be coupled to opposite sides of the conductive pad that may be neutrally strained.",

An electrical coupling between the primary conductive trace and the conductive pad may provide different resistances to current flow across a width thereof. Different resistances may be provided, for example, by providing an opening in the electrical coupling such as the perforation 407 illustrated in FIG. 4A.",
        "In an alternative, an electrical coupling according to embodiments of the present invention may have different thicknesses across a width thereof. The electrical coupling 405 of FIG. 4A, for example, may include a relatively thin layer of a conductive material in place of the perforation 407 wherein the relatively thin layer has a thickness that is less that a thickness of the remainder of the electrical coupling. Moreover, the relatively thin layer and the remainder of the electrical coupling may comprise the same material. In another alternative, the electrical coupling may include a layer of a first conductive material in place of the perforation 407 at a central portion thereof and a layer of a second conductive material along peripheral portions thereof wherein the first and second conductive materials have different resistivities. In addition, the layer of the second conductive material may extend across the electrical coupling on the layer of the first conductive material.
