    "abstract": "The printer reads a capacity number of printed sheets and a accumulated number of printed sheets of a toner cartridge stored in a cartridge memory of toner cartridge and compares them to determine whether toner cartridge's service life has expired. Similarly, it reads toner cartridge's product information stored in the cartridge memory, and compares it with an authorized product's product information to determine whether the toner cartridge is an authorized product. If it is determined that toner cartridge's life has expired or the toner cartridge is not an authorized product, the printer executes printing process in the safety mode with an increased frequency compared to that of the standard mode. Thus, the printer allows continuation of printing without deteriorating printing quality and without halting instantly even when a toner cartridge, whose service life has expired, or an unauthorized product is used.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The invention related to a printing device. More specifically, it relates to a printing device that allows the printing process to be continued without deteriorating printing quality or without halting the printing operation instantly even when a developing agent cartridge, whose service life has expired or which is not an authorized product, is used.",
        "2. Description of Related Art",
        "The toner cartridge of a printing device such as a printer is a consumable item and it is necessary to replace it with a new cartridge when the toner material stored inside the cartridge is used up. If the used up cartridge is replaced with a cartridge authorized by the manufacturer of said printer (\u201cauthorized product\u201d), the printing quality and reliability are guaranteed. However, refilled cartridges that are manufactured by using used-up cartridge bodies of authorized products and refilling them with unauthorized toners or toners of other manufacturers (\u201crefilled product\u201d) or cartridges made by other manufacturers in imitation of authorized products (\u201cunauthorized product\u201d) are available on the market, and they sometimes caused deterioration of printing quality or reliability or even printer problems. Also, each component of the cartridge has a specific service life, so that even an authorized product is used, it may cause similar troubles when a service life of a part of its components has expired even if its toner has still remained.",
        "In the meanwhile, there are printing device inventions that are capable of judging whether a cartridge is an authorized one depending on the data stored in the cartridge memory (e.g., JP-10-69139A), judging whether a cartridge is a refilled product by detecting increase of the toner quantity recorded on the cartridge memory (e.g., JP-2001-100530A), judging whether a cartridge is a refilled product by detecting damages on the cartridge body making the body impossible to open it without damaging a certain part of it (e.g., Patent Application 2001-125462), and others.",
        "However, in any of these prior arts, it is designed to stop or prohibit printing if the loaded cartridge is found to be a refilled product and the like, so that it has a problem that a user can use a product by mistake without noticing that it is a refilled product, or an authorized product but its service life has expired, or an unauthorized product, in which case the user has no choice to stop printing if a replacement authorized product is not available on the spot.",
        "The present invention is made under the consideration of such a problem of the prior art, and is intended to provide a printing device that is capable of continuing the printing process without causing such troubles as deterioration of printing quality and reliability or printer malfunctions, etc., even when a refilled product, a cartridge whose service life has expired, or an unauthorized product is used.",
        "Said objective of the present invention can be accomplished by the following means:",
        "(1) A printing device comprising: a judging unit for judging whether a service life of a developing agent cartridge has expired; and an operation mode setting unit for setting up its own operation mode to a safety mode in order to prevent printing troubles when said judgment unit determines that the service life of said developing agent cartridge has expired.",

As shown in FIG. 1, the printing system according to this embodiment is equipped with a printer 1A as a printing device and a PC (personal computer) 2 as a printing job transmission device, which are connected via a network 3 to communicate with each other. The types and the number of equipment to be connected to network 3 are not limited to those shown in FIG. 1.",
        "FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing the constitution of printer 1A according to the present embodiment. As shown in FIG. 2, printer 1A contains a CPU 11, a ROM 12, a RAM 13, an operating panel unit 14, a printing unit 15, and a network interface 16, all of which are interconnected by a bus 17 for exchanging signals.",
        "CPU 11 controls various parts indicated above and executes various arithmetic processes according to a program. ROM 12 stores various programs and parameters for controlling basic operations of printer 1A. RAM 13 stores programs and data temporarily as a working area.",
        "Operating panel unit 14 consists of a display panel, fixed keys, indicator lamps and others used for various inputting and displaying purposes.",
        "Printing unit 15 prints image data on printing paper by means of the electronic photograph method. FIG. 3 is a drawing showing the structure of a printing unit 15 of printer 1A. As shown in FIG. 3, printing unit 15 is equipped with a sensitizing drum 151, a charging roller 152, a toner cartridge 153, a developing roller 154, a transfer roller 155, a paper feeding tray 156, a fixing roller 157, and a paper discharge tray 158. When image data is received, printing unit 15 uniformly charges the surface of sensitizing drum 151 by means of charging roller 152, and attaches toner supplied from toner cartridge 153 by means of developing roller 154 to the electrostatic latent images on it, after exposing it with lights on the basis of the received image data. Next, the toner is transferred by transfer roller 155 to a sheet of printing paper transferred from paper feeding tray 156, fixing roller 157 fixes the toner on the paper, and the paper with an image formed on it is discharged to paper discharge tray 158.",
        "In the present embodiment, printing unit 15 is using the cleaner-less method which enables the system to do development and cleaning simultaneously in the developing unit by optimizing the conditions of developing bias potential (JP-9-269709A). Printing unit 15 is capable of executing a cleaning sequence independent of the printing sequence, adjusting the development bias to the optimum level, and rotating sensitizing drum 151 one revolution, to cause the cycle of collecting the toner on sensitizing drum 151, sensitizing drum 152, and transfer roller 155 on the toner cartridge twice in a row, thus achieving the cleaning without fail.",
        "In the present embodiment, toner cartridge 153 is equipped with a cartridge memory 153A with read and write capabilities, and printer 1A is capable of judging whether the service life of the currently loaded toner cartridge has expired or not by accessing a cartridge memory 153A. In other words, the information about the number of sheets that can be printed with said cartridge while maintaining the guaranteed quality, i.e., the service life information that represents the service life of said cartridge, is recorded in a certain area of cartridge memory 153A when it is shipped by the manufacturers plant. Another area of cartridge memory 153A holds the information about the accumulated number of sheets printed using said cartridge up until that time, i.e., the consumption information that represents the amount of usage of said cartridge memory at the present time.",
        "Cartridge memory 153A is connected with bus 17 by signal lines in order to allow printer 1A to access said specified area of cartridge memory 153A to read the capacity number of printed sheets and the accumulated number of printed sheets, and to calculate the consumption rate (consumption rate=capacity number of printed sheets/accumulated number of printed sheets\u00d7100). It makes a judgment as to whether the consumption rate has exceeded the threshold value, and determines that the currently loaded toner cartridge's service life has not expired if the consumption rate is lower than the threshold value and that the currently loaded toner cartridge's service life has expired if the consumption rate exceeds the threshold value.",
        "As it is described later, the accumulated number of printed sheets is increased one each time when a page is printed and is never reduced. This way, the consumption rate never returns to zero even when the cartridge is refilled with toner by someone who is not the manufacturer of printer 1A.",
        "Network interface 16 is an interface to connect with a network for communicating with other devices on the network using standards such as Ethernet\u00ae, Token Ring, FDDI, etc.",
        "The printer driver for printer 1A is installed on the operation system (OS) of PC2 in order to generate the printing job from the application data and transmit it to printer 1A, monitor the current status of the printing process, or control various settings of printer 1A.",
        "Network 3 can be a LAN connecting computers and network equipment according to standards such as Ethernet\u00ae, Token Ring, and FDDI, or a WAN that consists of several LANs connected by a dedicated line.",
        "Next, the outline of the printing system according to this embodiment will be described below. FIG. 4 is a flowchart showing the sequence of printing process by means of printer 1A in the present embodiment. The algorithm indicated by the flowchart of FIG. 4 is stored as a control program on ROM 12 of printer 1A, read out by RAM 13, and is executed by CPU 11 when the operation starts.",
        "In FIG. 4, printer 1A waits until it receives the printing job from PC2 (S101: No), accesses the specified area of cartridge memory 153A of toner cartridge 153 of printing unit 15 to read the accumulated number of printed sheets and the capacity number of printed sheets of said toner cartridge onto RAM 13 (S102) when the printing job is received from PC2 via network 3 and network interface 16 (S101: Yes), and calculates the consumption rate from these data (S103). The consumption rate thus obtained is compared with the predetermined threshold value to make a judgment whether said toner cartridge's service life has expired (S104).",
        "If it is judged that the toner cartridge's service life has not expired (S104: No), the standard mode printing process is executed (S105). FIG. 5 is a flowchart showing the sequence of the standard mode printing process by means of printer 1A in the present embodiment.

        "Although the service life information and the consumption information were described in the above embodiments that they were based on the number of sheets to be printed by the printer, they can also be based on the number of effective pixels (number of pixels other than white pixels) used in forming images, or the amount of toner consumed.",
        "Although the service life information was described in the above embodiments that it is read from the cartridge memory of the toner cartridge, it can be the service life information stored preliminarily in the ROM of the printer, etc.",
        "Moreover, in the above embodiments, the safety mode was described as a mode in which printing is executed with an increased frequency of cleaning processes as compared to those of a standard mode, but it can also be a process of printing by increasing the frequency of calibration for compensating the image quality or the frequency of data transmission process for controlling the printing device status to the control center, or a process of printing at a lower speed for reducing the possibility of causing troubles such as jamming. Since a better quality of printing can be achieved by using only the authorized products, it can also have functions of displaying a warning that the present cartridge is an unauthorized or information about stores where the authorized products can be purchased.",
        "Although the printing device was described as a printer in the description of the embodiments, the present invention is not limited to it, and can be an MFP with a printing capability such as a digital copying machine and a facsimile device.",
        "The printing device and the method according to this invention can be realized by a dedicated hardware circuit for executing the abovementioned steps, or by causing a CPU to execute a program where said steps are described. If the present invention is to be materialized by the latter means, said programs for operating the printing device can be provided by computer-readable recording media such as a floppy\u00ae disk and CD-ROM, or can be provided on-line via a network such as the Internet. In this case, the program recorded on the computer-readable recording medium is normally transferred to and stored in a memory device such as ROM and a hard disk. The program can also be provided as independent application software or can be built into the software of the printing device as a part of its function.",
        "As can be seen from the above description, the printing device according to the present invention is capable of continuing the printing job without causing such troubles as deterioration of printing quality and reliability or printer malfunctions, when a developing agent cartridge whose service life has expired or a developing agent cartridge of unauthorized product is used."
