To this end, a first adjustment value for adjusting printing positions among a plurality of printing elements included in a printing element row is obtained. Next, printing positions among a plurality of printing elements are adjusted based on the first adjustment value. Then a second adjustment value for adjusting printing positions among not less than two of the printing element rows is obtained. Thereby variations of printing positions in a discharge port row and displacement of printing positions among discharge port rows are properly adjusted in different phases, and adverse effects generated by two kinds of different causes are collectively suppressed.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a printing apparatus in which an image is formed by applying a printing agent onto a printing medium from printing means having a plurality of printing elements arranged. In particular, the present invention relates to a method of, and a configuration for, adjusting printing position displacement of the printing elements.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "A printing apparatus having functions of a printer, a copier, a facsimile machine and the like, or a printing apparatus used as an outputting device of a complex electric device or a work station including a computer or a word processor is configured so that an image (including characters and the like) is printed on a printing medium such as paper and a plastic sheet based on image information (including character information and the like). Depending on the printing method, such a printing apparatus can be classified into an inkjet method, a wire dot method, a thermal method, a laser beam method and the like. Among the above, a printing apparatus using the inkjet method (an inkjet printing apparatus), which carries out printing by discharging inks from printing means (a printing head) onto a printing medium, has a number of superior characteristics when compared with other printing methods in that higher resolution is easily achieved, high speed printing is possible in an excellently silent state, and the price and costs are low. Thus, the inkjet printing apparatus has become popular in a wide range from office use to personal use.",
        "In general, in an inkjet printing apparatus, a printing head, which is configured by integrally arranging a plurality of printing elements including ink discharge ports and liquid paths for supplying inks to the ink discharge ports, is used. In addition, to cope with color images, inkjet printing apparatus include printing heads for a plurality of colors in many cases.",
        "FIG. 1 is a perspective view for describing an inner mechanism of a general inkjet printing apparatus. In FIG. 1, reference numeral 101 denotes ink cartridges. Here, four ink cartridges respectively storing black ink, cyan ink, magenta ink and yellow ink are prepared. Reference numeral 102 denotes a printing head, which is capable of discharging ink supplied from the ink cartridges 101 for the respective colors in the \u2212Z direction in FIG. 1.",
        "Reference numeral 106 denotes a carriage, which is capable of moving and scanning in the X direction in FIG. 1 with the ink cartridges 101 for the four colors and the printing head 102 mounted thereon. During the time when a printing operation is not carried out, or when a recovering operation of the printing head 102 or the like is carried out, the carriage 106 is caused to wait at a home position (h) shown by a dotted line in FIG. 1.",
        "Reference numeral 103 denotes a paper conveying roller, which conveys a printing medium P to the sub-scanning direction which is the Y direction by rotating with spurs 104 while supporting the printing medium P. Reference numeral 105 denotes a pair of paper feeding rollers, which feeds the printing medium P, and which plays a role of pressing the printing medium P in common with the paper conveying roller 103 and the spurs 104.",
        "The carriage 106 is in the h position (home position) in FIG. 1 before starting printing, and moves and scans in the X direction when a printing start instruction is received. At the same time, the printing head 102 carries out discharge of inks according to printing signals. The discharged ink droplets are placed on the printing medium P. When finishing printing on the printing medium up to an end portion positioned on the opposite side of the home position, the carriage 106 returns to the original home position, and repeats printing in the X direction again. Otherwise, printing can be carried out by the carriage 106 moving and scanning in the \u2212X direction without returning to the home position. When the printing scanning for one time has been completed, the printing medium P is conveyed by the pair of paper feeding rollers 105 and the paper conveying roller 103 by a predetermined amount in the Y direction. By intermittently repeating the printing scanning and the conveyance operation as described above, an image is sequentially formed on the printing medium P.",
        "FIG. 2 is a schematic view for describing an arrangement state of the discharge ports for two colors which are observed in a case where the printing head 102 is viewed from the Z direction. In FIG. 2, reference numeral 201 denotes one discharge port of a discharge port row A for discharging black ink, and reference numeral 202 denotes one discharge port of a discharge port row B for discharging cyan ink. In FIG. 2, the discharge port rows A and B respectively have discharge ports of L=12, and each of the ink discharge ports is arranged at 1/600-inch intervals in the Y direction. Therefore, ink is discharged from each of the discharge ports while the printing head 102 is moving in the X direction, so that an image is formed with a printing density of 600 dpi (dot/inch) in the Y direction. In FIG. 2, n1 to n12 are reference numerals denoting arrangement positions of the respective discharge ports. The ink discharge port 201 is n12 in the discharge port row A, and the ink discharge port 202 is n1 in the discharge port row B.",
        "In the present example, an amount of ink discharged from each of the discharge ports is set at approximately 2 pl per a droplet. In addition, a discharge frequency for stably discharging this amount of the ink droplet is set at 30 KHz, and a discharge speed is set at approximately 20 m/sec. In addition, a speed in the main scanning direction (X direction) of the carriage 106 on which the printing head 102 such as the above is mounted is approximately 25 inch/sec. With this, an image is formed with a printing density of approximately 1200 dpi in the main scanning direction.",
        "Incidentally, in the printing head 102 such as the above having a general configuration, it has been heretofore known that displacement of dots is caused on a printing medium mainly for the following reasons. First, nozzle rows for a plurality of colors vary due to inaccuracy in manufacturing. Second, the printing head 102 is inaccurately installed to the carriage 106 when mounting the printing head 102 to the carriage 106. Third, a timing gap occurs in a case where main printing scanning is bi-directionally carried out. Then, to correct such displacement of dot placement, various printing position adjusting means and methods have been already proposed and implemented.",
        "A printing position adjusting method applied to an inkjet printing apparatus will be described below. In general, in an inkjet printing apparatus, a printing position adjusting mode is included for adjusting dot placement prior to carrying out a normal printing operation.",
        "FIG. 3 is a flowchart for describing each process carried out by an inkjet printing apparatus and a user at the time of performing the printing position adjustment.",
        "First, when a printing position adjusting mode is designated, the printing apparatus prints predetermined check patterns on a printing medium in Step S4601.",
        "FIG. 4 is a diagram showing one example of the check patterns outputted in Step S4601. Here, nine patterns printed in the following manner are shown. Timing of discharge from the discharge port row B is shifted from timing of discharge from the discharge port row A on a pixel-by-pixel basis from +4 pixels to \u22124 pixels in order to align the dot placement from the discharge port rows A and B arranged in the printing head 102. In the printing apparatus in this example, adjusting resolution for aligning printing positions of the discharge port rows A and B is set at one pixel out of 1200 dpi(dot/inch), that is, approximately 21 \u03bcm, and each pattern is printed with a resolution equal to the adjusting resolution.",
        "FIG. 5 is a view showing that patterns obtained by shifting the two timing respectively by +2 to 0 pixels, out of the nine patterns shown in FIG. 4, on an enlarged scale. In FIG. 5, black circles and white circles are dots printed by the discharge port row A and the discharge port row B, respectively. Since the black circle dots printed by the discharge port row A are placed by discharging ink at the same timing, the black circle dots are printed in the same position in the main scanning direction. In contrast, since the white circle dots printed by the discharge port row B are placed by discharging ink at the timing of being shifted for one pixel, the while circle dots are also placed by being shifted on a pixel-by-pixel basis in the scanning direction in each of the printed patterns. In the present patterns, + direction shows a state where the printing head discharges ink at further delayed timing while the printing head is moving in the main scanning direction.",
        "In the patterns shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, a state shown by +1 becomes a state where lines formed by the two discharging rows are overlapped most, which is recognized as a pattern close to a straight line. That is, it can be determined that the discharging timing of the discharge port rows A and B are in a most congruent state. In contrast, in a state shown by +2 or 0, distances d1 and d3 between the two lines are printed at approximately 21-\u03bcm intervals, though the lines are in the opposite directions.",
        "Referring to FIG. 3 again, in the following Step S4602, the user selects a pattern, which is the closest to a straight line, of the nine patterns to enter the information from the printing apparatus, the host computer connected thereto, or the like. In the present example, as described above, it can be determined that the pattern of +1 is the closest to a straight line, and the user enters this information.",
        "In Step S4603, the printing apparatus stores the information entered in Step S4602 in a memory (for example, a rewritable non-volatile memory such as an EEPROM) in the main body. By this, the printing position adjusting mode has been completed.",
        "When printing is next carried out, the printing apparatus adjusts discharging timing of the discharge port rows A and B based on the information stored in the memory. By this, an image can be formed in a state where the printing positions of the two discharge port rows A and B are optimized.",
        "The method of adjusting printing positions of the discharge port rows A and B has been described above. However, in a case where inks of a plurality of colors are discharged, or where a printing head having a plurality of discharge port rows for each color is used, printing position adjustment is needed for further more discharge port rows. In such a case, it can be addressed by having a configuration in which timing of each of the discharge port rows is adjusted by synchronizing with the timing of the discharge port row A as a reference and the respective adjustment value data are stored. In addition, even though a single discharge port row is used, in a case of bi-directional printing where discharge is carried out in the forward and backward movements of the carriage, a printing adjusting mode for adjusting the timing of discharge in the forward movement and the timing of discharge in the backward movement can also be achieved by a similar pattern and flowchart.",
        "By the above-described conventional printing adjusting method, it has been possible to adjust printing positions between the plurality of discharge port rows and printing positions at the time of the bi-directional printing. However, it has not been possible to adjust printing positions in a single row. In recent inkjet printing apparatuses, demand for high-definition images comparable to film photos has increased, and further minimization of droplets and further enhancement of high-definition of the printing element arrangement have been in progress. Then, in such circumstances, situations have arisen where slight position displacement or a slight inclination of the discharge port row arranged in one row on the printing head cannot be neglected. In particular, an inclination of the discharge port row largely affects an image.",
        "Under such circumstances, several methods of correcting adverse effects on an image due to an inclination of a printing head have been invented. In Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 7-309007, there has been disclosed an inkjet print system in which a displacement correcting circuit is provided to add offsets to image data to be printed by each discharge port in order to reduce displacement of printing positions caused by rotation of a printing head. In addition, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 7-40551, there has been disclosed an inkjet printing apparatus in which a plurality of discharge port rows arranged on a printing head is divided into a plurality of blocks so as to adjust the discharging order and intervals of each discharging block according to the inclination. Moreover, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 11-240143, there has been disclosed a method to correct displacement of printing positions in joint portions of each printing scanning caused by the inclination of the head. For that purpose, first, an offset amount is set from a displacement amount between a printing position by the discharge port on the uppermost portion and a printing position by the discharge port on the lowermost portion. After that, for one portion of the discharge ports, printing is carried out by shifting data by an amount based on the offset amount. Moreover, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2004-9489, there has been disclosed an inkjet printing apparatus having means for changing allocation of data to be printed by each discharge port according to the inclination of the printing head.",
        "However, in a conventional inkjet printing apparatus, though it has been possible to correct the inclination of a printing head or each of printing position displacement between respective discharge port rows, batch correction of complex printing position displacement caused by various causes has been difficult. For example, when the above-described printing position adjustment between respective rows is carried out, there has been a disadvantage that normal adjustment cannot be achieved because the user is confused or cannot select a proper value when it is in the state of including inclination in each discharge port row.",
        "The above-described problem will be briefly described below.",
        "FIG. 6 is a view showing a configuration similar to the configuration shown in FIG. 2 but having the printing head 102 with an inclination \u03b8 in each of two discharge port rows. In the present example, n1 of the discharge port row A is arranged in the position away from n12 by approximately 63 \u03bcm in the +X direction. This distance corresponds to a distance for approximately three pixels in the printing apparatus in which printing is carried out at 1200 dpi. On the other hand, n1 of the discharge port row B is arranged in the position away from n12 by approximately 63 \u03bcm in the \u2212X direction. This distance also corresponds to a distance for approximately three pixels in the printing apparatus in which printing is carried out at 1200 dpi.",
        "FIG. 7 is a diagram showing a printing state where check patterns similar to those in FIG. 4 are printed by using the printing head shown in FIG. 6.",
        "FIG. 8 is a view showing that patterns of \u22121 to \u22123, out of the nine patterns shown in FIG. 7, on an enlarged scale. In FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, there is no case where lines by the two discharge port rows are recognized as a straight line like the pattern of +1 shown in FIGS. 4 and 5. The case where the distance between the two lines actually becomes the smallest is the pattern of \u22122. However, even in this state, displacement of d2=63 \u03bcm at maximum is caused between the discharge port rows A and B. Then, in the patterns of \u22121 and \u22123 in which timing is shifted by one pixel from the pattern of \u22122, displacement of approximately 84 \u03bcm is caused in the opposite directions.",
        "In this manner, in a case of the discharge port row having the inclination shown in FIG. 6, a difference of each pattern is difficult to be determined, and it is difficult for the user to select the proper pattern of \u22122. In addition, even in a case where the proper value \u22122 is selected, the printing positions of the two discharge port rows are kept including the displacement of approximately 63 \u03bcm in an image to be outputted thereafter.",
        "Such displacement of dot placement in the discharge port row is caused by inaccuracy at the time of manufacturing a printing head, inaccuracy at the time of mounting the printing head on the carriage, an inclination of the discharge port face against a flat surface of the printing medium, or the like. Therefore, a printing apparatus or a printing head is manufactured with consideration of avoiding generating such inaccuracy as much as possible at the time of manufacturing or mounting thereof. However, slight inaccuracy caused in spite of such an effort to suppress is not allowed for a demanded high-definition image recently. The problem due to the inclination of the discharge port row has become a major problem in recent inkjet printing apparatuses in which discharge of small droplets is achieved.",
        "The present invention has been made in view of the forgoing problems. Accordingly, the present invention can provide a printing apparatus and a method of adjusting printing positions with which image deterioration is suppressed as much as possible. The image deterioration is complexly caused by inaccuracy in discharge port rows occurred during manufacturing of a printing apparatus and mounting of a printing head, and displacement of printing positions among the discharge port rows.",
        "In a first aspect of the present invention is a printing apparatus for forming an image by moving and scanning a plurality of printing element rows relatively to a printing medium, each of the printing element rows being formed by arranging a plurality of printing elements applying color agents onto the printing medium, comprises first adjusting means for obtaining a first adjustment value for adjusting printing positions among a plurality of printing elements included in a predetermined one of the printing element rows; and second adjusting means for obtaining a second adjustment value for adjusting printing positions among not less than two of the printing element rows, which are predetermined, wherein the second adjusting means obtains the second adjustment value based on the first adjustment value.",
        "The second aspect of the present invention is a method of adjusting printing positions of a printing apparatus for forming an image by moving and scanning a plurality of printing element rows relatively to a printing medium, each of the printing element rows being formed by arranging a plurality of printing elements applying color agents onto the printing medium, comprising the steps of: obtaining a first adjustment value for adjusting printing positions among a plurality of printing elements included in a predetermined one of the printing element row; and obtaining a second adjustment value for adjusting printing positions among not less than two of the printing element rows, which are predetermined, wherein the second adjustment value is obtained based on the first adjustment value.",

The second check patterns are printed in a state where an inclination is corrected by the information stored in Step S1503, and after that, printing positions of the discharge port rows A and B are adjusted.

The timing of discharge from each discharging port row can be further adjusted on a pixel-by-pixel basis after correcting an inclination \u03b8 by the first check patterns. Here, + direction shows a state where printing by the discharge port row B is carried out at later timing than the discharge port row A, while \u2212 direction shows a state where printing by the discharging port row B is carried out at faster timing than the discharge port row A. The pattern of 0 shows a state where printing is carried out by the two discharge port rows without shifting the timing. The pattern of +1 shows a state where printing is carried out by shifting the discharge port row B by one pixel relatively to the discharge port row A. The pattern of +2 shows a state where printing is carried out by shifting the discharge port row B by two pixels relatively to the discharge port row A.",
        "In this manner, by shifting discharging timing of each discharge port row in a phased manner, a distance between two pixels in the most distant positions in each discharge port row is also varied in a phased manner. For example, the distance d3 which nearly equals to 42 \u03bcm in the pattern of 0 is reduced to the distance d2 which nearly equals to 21 \u03bcm in the pattern of +1, and increases again to the distance d1 which nearly equals to 42 \u03bcm in the pattern of +2. In the present example, a preferable image most superior in linearity can be obtained in a state where printing is carried out at the timing shown in the pattern of +1.",
        "The patterns of the present embodiment shown in FIGS. 14 and 15 are printed after the inclination in each discharge port row is corrected in advance. Therefore, when compared with the conventional patterns shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, a pattern superior in linearity can be relatively easily and accurately selected.",

        "As described above, according to the present embodiment, printing positions among respective discharge port rows can be corrected after correcting an inclination in each discharge port raw. For example, in the case of the conventional method described by using FIGS. 7 and 8, the distance between the most distant pixels of the discharge port rows A and B is 63 \u03bcm even after adjustment.",
        "In contrast, according to the present embodiment, even the distance between the most distant pixels can be fit in the distance of 21 \u03bcm. That is, according to the present embodiment, since dots to be formed on a printing medium by discharge of each discharge port can be placed in a more precise position, printing with higher definition and higher quality image can be obtained. In addition, since a user is not confused when selecting an adjustment value like before, a possibility that wrong information is entered is reduced.",

In addition, in the discharge port row B of the printing head 1602, a discharge port n1 is arranged in a position 25 shifted by approximately 63 \u03bcm in the \u2212X direction relatively to a discharge port n12.

In FIG. 27, black circles and white circles show dots that ink is printed by the discharge port row A and that ink is printed by the discharge port row B, respectively. The discharging timing of each port row can be further adjusted on a pixel-by-pixel basis after correcting an inclination \u03b8 by the first check patterns.",
        "In this manner, by shifting the discharging timing at each discharge port row in a phased manner, a distance between two pixels, which are in the most distant positions in each discharge port row, is also varied in a phased manner. In the present example, the distance d1 which nearly equals to 42 \u03bcm in the pattern of 0 is reduced to the distance d2 which nearly equals to 21 \u03bcm in the pattern of \u22121, and increases again to the distance d3 which nearly equals to 42 \u03bcm in the pattern of \u22122. That is, in the present example, a preferable image with the most superior linearity is obtained in a state where printing is carried out at the timing shown by the pattern of \u22121.",
        "FIG. 28 is a schematic view showing the patterns of 0 to +2, out of the nine patterns shown in the patterns F, on an enlarged scale. In the figure, black circles and white circles show dots that ink is printed by the discharge port row C and that the ink is printed by the discharge port row D, respectively. In the present example, the distance d3 which nearly equals to 42 \u03bcm in the pattern of 0 is reduced to the distance d2 which nearly equals to 21 \u03bcm in the pattern of +1, and increases again to the distance d3 which nearly equals to 42 \u03bcm in the pattern of +2. That is, in the present embodiment, a preferable image with the most superior linearity is obtained in a state where printing is carried out at the timing shown by the pattern of +1.",
        "FIG. 29 is a schematic view showing the patterns of +1 to +3, out of the nine patterns shown in the patterns G, on an enlarged scale. In FIG. 29 black circles and white circles show dots that ink is printed by the discharge port row A and that ink is printed by the discharge port row C, respectively. In the present example, the distance which is 63 \u03bcm in the pattern of 0 is reduced in a phased manner to the distance d3 which nearly equals to 42 \u03bcm in the pattern of +1, and reduced to the distance d2 which nearly equals to 21 \u03bcm in the pattern of +2, and increases again to the distance d1 which nearly equals to 42 \u03bcm in the pattern of +3. That is, in the present embodiment, a preferable image with the most superior linearity is obtained in a state where printing is carried out at the timing shown by the pattern of +2.",
        "Returning to FIG. 23 again, in Step S4005, the user observes the second check patterns and selects a pattern with the most superior linearity of the nine phased patterns for each of the patterns E, F, and G. That is, the pattern of \u22121 for the patterns E, the pattern of +1 for the patterns F, and the pattern of +2 for the patterns G, are selected, and the information is entered from the printing apparatus or the host computer or the like connected to the printing apparatus.",
        "In the following Step S4006, the CPU 300 stores the entered information in the EEPROM 318 in the printing apparatus. The region where the data are stored here is a region different from the region where the data are stored: in Step S4003. By this, the printing position adjusting mode of the present embodiment has been completed.",
        "It should be noted that in the above-described steps, only the information of alignment to three sets of the four discharge port rows A to D is entered. For example, the alignment of the discharge port rows A and D and the alignment of the discharge port rows B and C are not actually carried out. However, printing positions of all combinations of the discharge port rows can be relatively corrected by using the three pieces of information entered above. For example, there has been stored that the discharge port row C needs correction by +2 relatively to the discharge port row A, and the discharge port row D needs correction by +1 relatively to the discharge port row C. Therefore, the discharge port row D needs correction by (+2)+(+1)=+3 relatively to the discharge port row A.",
        "In addition, the second check patterns for alignment of the printing positions of four kinds of the discharging port rows are not limited to the patterns shown in FIGS. 25 and 26.",
        "FIG. 30 is a view showing another example applicable as the second check patterns of the present embodiment. Here, nine patterns that discharging timing of the discharge port rows B, C and D are shifted in a phased manner relatively to the discharge port row A are respectively printed as the patterns E, F and G in the same page. Enlarged views of the patterns E and F are similar to those in FIGS. 27 and 29.",
        "FIG. 31 is a schematic view showing the patterns of +2 to +4, out of the nine patterns shown in the patterns G in the second check patterns of this example, on an enlarged scale. In FIG. 31, black circles and white circles show dots that ink is printed by the discharge port row A and that ink is printed by the discharge port row D, respectively. In this example, the distance d3 which nearly equals to 42 \u03bcm in the pattern of +2 is reduced to the distance d2 which nearly equals to 21 \u03bcm in the pattern of +3, and increases to the distance d1 which nearly equals to 42 \u03bcm in the pattern of +4. That is, in this example, in the discharge port row D, a preferable image with the most superior linearity is obtained in a state where printing is carried out at the timing of +3 relatively to the discharge port row A. This value equals to the correction value calculated by using FIGS. 25 and 26.",
        "In a case where new image data to be printed are next entered from the image input unit 303, the CPU 300 refers to the seven pieces of information stored in the EEPROM 318. Then, it controls the head drive controlling circuit to carry out printing after setting timing at each discharge port.",
        "As described above according to the present embodiment, in an inkjet printing apparatus using a plurality of printing heads having a plurality of discharge port rows, printing positions among respective discharge port rows can be corrected after correcting an inclination in each discharge port row. By this, when compared with a conventional method, printing positions of dots can be adjusted with higher definition. In addition, similar to the above-described embodiment, there is no case where a user is confused when selecting an adjustment value; thereby a possibility of wrong information to be entered is reduced.",
        "In the above-described three embodiments, for simplicity, the description has been given by using the configuration in which twelve discharge ports are arranged in each discharge port row. However, effects of the present invention and the above-described embodiments can be similarly obtained even in a configuration in which more number of discharge ports and ink colors are prepared. For example, the effects of the present invention are valid even in a printing apparatus, which uses inks such as blue and red in addition to the four colors of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black described in the third embodiment, and which includes more discharge port rows and printing heads. In this case, more number of discharge ports in a group in the first check patterns or more number of divisions can be set.",
        "In addition, an ink amount discharged from each discharge port, a discharge frequency, printing resolution and the like are also not limited to the values shown in the above-described embodiments. An ink droplet larger or smaller than 2 pl can be also applied to the present invention. In addition, an amount of discharging ink can be varied for each discharge port row.",
        "FIG. 32 shows a printing head in which two discharge port rows having different arrangement pitches are arranged. In FIG. 32, each discharge port is arranged at 1/600-inch intervals in a discharge port row A, while each discharge port is arranged at 1/300 inch-intervals in a discharge port row B. Even in such a case, in each discharge port row, by dividing n1 to n12 of the discharge ports into groups with the method described in FIG. 13, an inclination in each discharge port row can be corrected. Moreover, as for alignment between each discharge port row, the discharge ports n1 to n12 in the discharge port row A may be aligned to the vicinity of the discharge ports n1 to n6 in the discharge port row B.",
        "FIG. 33 shows a printing head in which two discharge port rows having different number of discharge ports are arranged. In FIG. 33, twelve discharge ports are arranged at 1/600-inch intervals in a discharge port row A, while eighteen discharge ports are arranged in a discharge port row B. Even in such a case, in the discharge port row B, by dividing n1 to n18 of the discharge ports into two groups of n1 to n9 and n1 to n18 of the discharge ports, or into three groups of n1 to n6, n7 to n12, and n13 to n18 of the discharge ports, an inclination in the discharge port row can be corrected similarly to the above-described embodiments.",
        "FIG. 34 shows three printing heads in which a discharge port row having a different arrangement pitch is each arranged. In FIG. 34, each discharge port is arranged at 1/600-inch intervals in discharge port rows A and C, while each discharge port is arranged at 1/300-inch intervals in a discharge port row B. Even in such a case, in each discharge port row, by dividing n1 to n12 of the discharge ports into groups with the method described in FIG. 13, an inclination in each discharge port row can be corrected. In addition, as for alignment between each discharge row, the discharge ports n1 to n12 in the discharge port row A and the discharge ports n1 to n12 in the discharge port row C may be configured to be aligned to the vicinity of the discharge ports n1 to n6 in the discharge port row B.",
        "FIG. 35 shows three printing heads in which a discharge port row having different number of discharge ports is each arranged. In FIG. 35, twelve discharge ports are arranged at 1/600-inch intervals in discharge port rows A and C, while eighteen discharge ports are arranged in a discharge port row B. Even in such a case, in the discharge port row B, by dividing the discharge ports n1 to n18 into two groups of n1 to n9 and n10 to n18 of the discharge ports, or into three groups of n1 to n6, n7 to n12, and n13 to n18 of the discharge ports, an inclination in the discharge port row can be corrected similarly to the above-described embodiments.",
        "FIG. 36 shows two printing heads in which two discharge port rows having different arrangement pitches are respectively arranged. In FIG. 36, each discharge port is arrange at 1/600-inch intervals in discharge port rows A and C, while each discharge port is arrange at 1/300-inch intervals in discharge port rows B and D. Even in such a case, in each discharge port row, by dividing n1 to n12 of the discharge ports into groups with the method described in FIG. 13, an inclination in each of the discharge port rows can be corrected. In addition, as for alignment between each discharge row, the discharge ports n1 to n12 in the discharge port rows A and C may be configured to be aligned to the vicinity of the discharge ports in the discharge port rows B and D, respectively.",
        "FIG. 37 shows two printing heads in which two discharge port rows having different number of discharge ports are respectively arranged. In FIG. 37, twelve discharge ports are arranged at 1/600-inch intervals in discharge port rows A and B, while eighteen discharge ports are arranged in discharge port rows B and D. Even in such a case, in the discharge port rows B and D, by dividing n1 to n18 of the discharge ports into two groups of n1 to n9 and n10 to n18 of the discharge ports, or into three groups of n1 to n6, n7 to n12, and n13 to n18 of the discharge ports, inclinations in the discharge port rows can be corrected similarly to the above-described embodiments.",
        "As described above, the configuration and method of the present invention effectively function as long as a printing apparatus is provided with a plurality of discharge port rows no matter what an arrangement pitch or the number of discharge ports is. However, by use of FIG. 13, the above descriptions have been given by the configuration in which the plurality of discharge ports are evenly divided into the plurality of groups, but the present invention is not limited to such a configuration.",
        "FIGS. 38A and 38B show schematic views showing other examples of the second check patterns shown in FIGS. 12A and 12B. Here, when twelve discharge ports are divided into two groups to form the patterns of +1 and \u22121, the discharge ports are divided into a discharge port group of eight discharge ports n1 to n8 and a discharge port group of four discharge ports n9 to n12. In this manner, even though the number of the discharge ports included in each discharge port group is not always equal, as long as discharge can be carried out while shifting timing with respect to one another in respective discharge port groups divided by a predetermined method, effects similar to the above-described embodiments can be obtained.",
        "Incidentally, to print check patterns in which printing positions are each shifted by one pixel, divided discharge by discharge port groups as described above is not always needed. The above-described check patterns are stored in the memory in the printing apparatus or the host device connected to the printing apparatus. Therefore, the above-described position adjusting modes can normally function as long as the data are stored as the data each shifted by one pixel.",
        "In addition, the confirmation of the check patterns and the entry of the setting values are also not necessarily carried out by the user. For example, by including an optical sensor or the like in the printing apparatus for detecting a state of patterns, the processes of confirmation, selection, and entry by the user can be automatically carried out. By this way, image deterioration or the like due to an entry error or the like can be further suppressed.",
        "Moreover, as for the accuracy of the printing position alignment, it is also assumed in the above embodiments that printing position displacement to be generated on a pixel-by-pixel basis is corrected on a pixel-by-pixel basis, but the present invention is not limited to this. Actual printing position displacement is not generated on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and there is a case where displacement of not more than one pixel can affect an image. Even in such a case, a more preferable image can be obtained when position alignment can be carried out with higher accuracy by any means (for example, on a \u00bd pixel basis, on a \u2153 pixel basis, or the like).",
        "In addition, in the forgoing, as a specific example of check patterns, patterns for checking linearity of a ruler line printed by each discharge port row are applied, but the present invention is not limited to this. Conventionally, a several test patterns for determining displacement or an inclination of printing positions have already been proposed. Whatever the patterns are, the patterns can be applied to the present invention as long as the patterns can effectively function to determine a proper printing position. A characteristic of the present invention is that different kinds of printing position displacement such as an inclination in each discharge port row and printing positions among respective discharge port rows can be sequentially corrected in different phases. Therefore, even in a case where check patterns having different features in each correction are applied, the effects of the present invention are not changed at all. As long as a proper correction value is finally obtained based on the correction value obtained in each phase, it is included in the scope of the present invention.",
        "It should be noted that, in the foregoing, the inclination of the printing position on the printing medium in the image printed by one discharge port row has been described as attributable to the inclination \u03b8 of the discharge port row arranged on the printing head. However, in reality, such an inclination is caused by more various causes.",
        "FIGS. 39A and 39B are schematic views for describing another cause generating an inclination \u03b8 on the printing medium. In FIG. 39A, reference numeral 102 denotes a printing head, which discharges ink in the \u2212Z direction while moving and scanning in the X direction to a printing medium 3501. At this time, in a case where a mounting position of the printing head above the printing medium is inclined as shown in FIG. 39A, a distance to the printing medium 3501 (hereinafter referred to as a distance to paper) is varied according a position where discharge ports are arranged, even in a single discharge port row. In FIG. 39A, when a distance to paper of the discharge port positioned at the leftmost is assumed to be Z1 and a distance to paper of the discharge port positioned at the rightmost is assumed to be Z2, it follows: Z1>Z2. In such a state, a timing gap is caused when ink droplets reach the printing medium 3501 even when ink is discharged from each discharge port at the same timing. That is, the ink droplet 3502 discharged from the discharge port larger in the distance to paper is placed on the printing medium after the ink droplet 3503 discharged from the discharge port smaller in the distance to paper. Since the printing head 102 is moving and scanning at a constant speed in the X direction at the time of discharging, this difference between droplet placement timing appears as printing position displacement to the X direction as if an inclination is included in the discharge port row as shown in FIG. 39B.",
        "FIG. 40 is a schematic view for describing still another cause generating an inclination \u03b8 on the printing medium. In FIG. 40, the printing head 102 discharges ink in the \u2212Z direction while moving and scanning in the X direction to the printing medium 3501. In FIG. 40, shown is a state where various discharging speeds are included among respective discharge ports in the single discharge port row. An ink droplet 3504 discharged from the discharge port positioned at the left end in FIG. 40 is discharged at the slowest speed, and an ink droplet 3505 discharged from the discharge port positioned at the right end in FIG. 40 is discharged at the fastest speed. In such a case, even though the distance to paper from each discharge port is equal, timing of the ink droplets to reach the printing medium 3501 is shifted. That is, the ink droplet 3504, which is slower in discharging speed, is placed on the printing medium after the ink droplet 3505, which is faster in discharging speed. Since the printing head 102 is moving and scanning in the X direction at a constant speed at the time of discharging, this difference between droplet placement timing appears as printing position displacement to the X direction as if an inclination is included in the discharge port row as shown in FIG. 39B.",
        "FIG. 41 is a schematic view for describing still another cause generating an inclination \u03b8 on the printing medium. In FIG. 41, reference numerals 3201 and 3202 denote printing heads, which are fixed to the main body of the printing apparatus in a state of including the inclinations as shown in FIG. 41. In this manner, even in a state where each discharge port row per se does not include an inclination against the printing head, there is a case where an inclination is generated at the time of mounting the printing head on the printing apparatus.",
        "Even though the generation of an inclination \u03b8 in an image to be formed on the printing medium is caused by any of the causes described in, for example, FIGS. 39, 40 and 41, the method described in the above-mentioned embodiments can effectively function.",
        "It should be noted that, in the above-mentioned descriptions, an inkjet printing apparatus has been described as an example since the effects of the present invention on the problems to be solved by the present invention are likely to appear conspicuously. However, the present invention is not limited to such a printing method. As long as a printing head, in which a plurality of printing elements being able to apply color agents onto a printing medium is arranged, is used, and a printing apparatus for forming an image on a printing medium by the dot matrix method is used, the present invention is effective and the effects thereof can be obtained whatever means to apply printing agents is used. In the above-described embodiments, a discharge port being able to discharge ink as a droplet has merely been described as one printing element, and a discharge port row formed by arranging a plurality of discharge ports has merely been described as a printing element row.",
        "The present invention has been described in detail with respect to preferred embodiments, and it will now be apparent from the foregoing to these skilled in the art that changes and modification may be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspects, and it is the intention, therefore, that the appended claims cover all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit of the invention.",
