No. 7,004,518, which is a continuation in part of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/213,135, filed Aug. 5, 2002, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,722,716 issue date Apr. 20, 2004. That application claims the benefit of and incorporates by reference, U.S. provisional application No. 60/318,478, filed on Sept. 10, 2001.",
        "The present invention relates to door handle assemblies. More particularly, the present invention relates to low-profile door handle assemblies having door handles actuated by a non-rotational motion.",
        "Conventional door handle assemblies typically include a pair of faceplates, a slide bolt, and a pair of door handles. The slide bolt is assembled inside a standard bore of a door so that when the slide bolt extends, it engages the door to an aperture in a wall thereby closing the door and allowing the door to be locked. The standard bore is covered by two opposing faceplates. The door handles protrude from the faceplates.",
        "The height of a conventional door handle is typically 2.25 to 2.50 inches, as measured from a door surface. A conventional door often damages a wall, especially when a door is slammed into a wall. A wall can also be gradually damaged when a conventional door handle often contacts the wall. To minimize wall damage, people use devices, such as doorstops and rubber pads attached to the walls. However, doorstops and rubber pads are not aesthetically pleasing to some people. Doorstops and rubber pads also require additional cost, time, and effort to install. Additionally, doorstops and rubber pads leave permanent marks or holes on the wall when removed. Thus, a door handle that does not cause wall damage is desired.",
        "Another problem with a conventional door handle assembly is it requires rotation of the handle to open a door. Rotating a door handle is difficult at times, particularly when carrying an object with both hands, or particularly when the user is elderly, physically challenged, or has wrist problems. Thus, a door handle assembly that allows a user to open a door without having to rotate the door handle is also desired.",
        "A number of door handles and door handle assemblies are available. U.S. Pat. No. 2,260,74 ('74) discloses a low-profile handle assembly designed for automobiles. The handle assembly has a large disk-like plate. The front face of the disk-like plate is recessed and attaches a crossbar spanning across the recess. The crossbar has an offset projection at one of its ends to provide a finger piece for the handle assembly.",
        "A user would use the finger piece as a crank for raising and lowering the glass panels in windows. A user would also use the finger piece as a handhold or grip for use and assistance in closing the vehicle door. The problem with '74 is it only provides a handhold for opening or closing a door. The handhold does not actuate a lock or a slide bolt.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 5,085,474 ('474) discloses a latch opener of the push-pull type. '474 has a base plate secured to a door. A handle is mounted on the base plate to pivot about a first axis. The handle is attached to an actuator. The actuator is mounted on the base plate to pivot about a second axis perpendicular to the first axis. The actuator includes a projecting arm engageable in an opening of a latch bolt housing. When the arm engages a latch bolt, the arm causes the latch bolt to slide and thereby allowing the door to open. The latch bolt housing has a coil spring to continuously bias the latch bolt into a position protruding out of the door thereby allowing the door to close. The problem with '474 is that its handle protrudes in a manner that can cause wall damage. Additionally, its actuator is composed of multiple parts, which makes the actuator susceptible to mechanical malfunction and which makes the actuator expensive to manufacture.",

Bolt 70 may unitarily be constructed by molding or other techniques known in the art. A unitarily constructed bolt 70 provides a sturdier and thus more secure lock than a bolt made of multiple components. A lock provided by a bolt made of multiple components may easily be tampered. For example, if one component gives in to the tampering or if the component bends or breaks, the remaining components may lose the support provided by the component that gave in. In contrast, for a lock supported by a unitarily constructed bolt to be tampered, the entire bolt has to be destroyed. Since bolt 70 is usually positioned inside a standard bore of a door, tampering with bolt 70 may require destruction of the entire door.",
        "Bolt Housing",

        "Door Handle",
        "Previously described embodiments have described a door handle that is operated by a pulling motion, no matter which direction the door swings when opened. However, it may be beneficial to provide door handle assemblies where the motion used to actuate the door handle also serves to open the door. For example, a pulling motion may be most useful to operate a door handle when a door will swing inward, towards a person opening the door. A pushing motion may be used to operate a door handle when a door is to swing outward, away from a person opening a door. In this way, opening the door requires less force and operates in a more fluid manner. Such an embodiment may be especially useful for the disabled or for those who are not able to apply large amounts of force to operate a door handle and open a door.",

In this manner handle 406 is rotatably connected to faceplate 448. Pin 438 also supports wire spring 540. Spring 540 biases handle 406 away from faceplate 448.",
        "An actuator 430 may also be attached to mount 416. Actuator 430 has a hole 431 and a projection 470. Actuator 430 may be coupled to mount 416 by any suitable means, such as by inserting a pin 436 or other suitable fastener into pin openings 440 and 442 in parallel projections 418 and hole 431 in actuator 430, respectively. Mount 416 may be integrally formed on a faceplate 449 or may be coupled to faceplate 449 by any suitable means, such as by welding or adhesives. Pin 436 also supports wire spring 542. Spring 542 biases handle 404 away from faceplate 449.",
        "Projections 560 of door handle 404 may also have a roller or linkage 454 coupled thereto. Roller 454 may be a ball bearing, a bicycle chain roller, a metal roller, or a roller constructed of other materials, including rubbers, plastics, and the like. In certain embodiments, such as the one depicted in FIG. 26, roller 454 may rotate about a vertical axis. Roller 454 may rest against a curved surface 460 of actuator 430. Roller 454 may be attached to, and rotate around, a pin 462 of handle 404. Pin 462 passes through holes 562 and roller 454. Roller 454 may be attached to door handle 404 in other ways without departing from the scope of the present invention.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 28, door handle assembly 400 may further include a cam assembly 105. Cam assembly 105 is rotatably supported and mounted between faceplates 448 and 449. Faceplate 448 has a hole 510 and faceplate 449 has a hole 512. Cam assembly 105 has an end 105A, an end 105B and a raised abutting portion 250. End 105A extends through hole 510 and end 105B extends through hole 512. Further details of cam assembly 105 are shown in FIG. 16. Can assembly 105 includes a cam portion 240 and a cam shaft 242. Turning back to FIG. 28, cam assembly 105 is shaped to fit with bolt 476 so as to lock the door. Raised abutting portion 250 is adapted to abut bolt 476 and prevent the bolt from sliding away from the frame plate 502 thereby locking the door.",
        "A cam latch 48 can be secured to end 105A through the use of set screw 564. When cam latch 48 is rotated in one direction, raised abuting portion 250 prevents movement of bolt 476. Cam assembly 105 can further operate as previously described. An alternate cam access 244 can be mounted to end 105B. Alternate cam access 244 can be a depression that allows a flathead screwdriver or key to rotate cam assembly 105.",
        "With reference now to FIGS. 26 and 27. When the door handle assembly 400 is not being actuated, roller 454 may rest at a first position 464 on actuator 430. When handle 404 is pushed, roller 454 will travel along surface 460 of actuator 430, eventually reaching a second position 466, shown in FIG. 27. Referring back to FIG. 26, during operation, force will be transmitted from handle 404, through roller 454, to actuator 430. As roller 454 moves, the transmitted force will cause force to be applied to actuator 430 in different directions, causing actuator 430 to move. At the same time handle 404 will pivot about pin 419 with handle end 404A moving toward faceplate 449. A projection 470 of actuator 430 passes into actuator opening 474 formed in a bolt 476. As roller 454 moves from first position 464 to second position 466, projection 470 of actuator 430 will engage a portion of the interior of bolt 476 towards the interior of a door (not shown in FIG. 26), causing bolt 470 to be retracted away from a wall aperture in a wall (not shown in FIG. 26).",
        "Bolt 470 may be biased towards the frame plate by spring 78. When force is no longer applied to door handle 404, springs 78 and 542 will cause bolt 470 to be biased towards the frame plate 502, in turn causing roller 454 to move from second position 466 back to first position 464 and handle 404 to move away from faceplate 449 back to an undepressed position.",
        "The present invention is not limited by the position of roller 454 or curved surface 460. For example, as shown in FIGS. 35 and 36 another embodiment of a push door handle assembly 600 is shown. Push door handle assembly 600 can have a roller 454 that is mounted on actuator 430 using pin 602. Curved surface 620 may be on door handle 404. Operation of this embodiment is analogous to that of the door handle assembly 400 previously described in FIGS. 26 and 27.",
        "With reference now to FIGS. 26 and 27, the door can also be opened by the use of pull handle 406. Pull handle 406 can operate the same as previously described for door handle assembly 20. Pull handle 406 is rotatably mounted to faceplate 448 by pin 438. Actuator 550 has an end 551 that extends into bolt aperture 476. Pulling on handle 406 causes bolt 476 to retract allowing opening of the door.",
        "The components of door handle assembly 400 may be used with any previously described door handle assemblies, or with other door handle assemblies now existing or later developed, that are within the knowledge of one skilled in the art. In certain embodiments, a door handle assembly may be configured so that it has push handles on both sides of the door handle assembly.",
        "Conclusion",
        "Although the description above contains many specifications, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but as merely providing illustrations of some of presently preferred embodiments of this invention. Thus, the scope of the invention should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalents rather than by the examples given."
