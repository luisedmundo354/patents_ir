        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an ink for ink-jet recording.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "One of the important characteristics required of an ink for ink-jet recording is that the ink exhibits good ozone resistance. This is to prevent color fading (resulting in a reduction in image quality) of an ink-jet printed material caused by contact with any ozone present in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, a copper phthalocyanine-based dye has been employed as a coloring agent for a cyan ink for ink-jet recording. Such a dye has better light fastness when compared to magenta and yellow dyes but has a problem in that it exhibits insufficient ozone resistance.",
        "Another important characteristic required for an ink for ink-jet recording is that the ink resists the growth of mildew. When mildew grows in an ink, the mildew itself acts as a foreign material. Therefore, the ejection stability of an ink containing mildew from nozzles of an ink-jet head decreases, causing clogging of the nozzles. Hence, a thiazole-based compound is added as a mildew proofing agent to an ink for ink-jet recording, irrespective of whether a copper phthalocyanine dye is employed as a coloring agent or not (U.S. Pat. No. 6,514,330B1).",
        "However, in an ink for ink-jet recording to which a mildew proofing agent composed of a thiazole-based compound is added, although the growth of mildew is suppressed, a further problem exists in that the formation of a precipitate is observed. In particular, this tendency is noted when a copper phthalocyanine dye is employed as a coloring agent. Occasionally, in order to prevent corrosion of metal materials in an ink passage of an ink-jet head, an anticorrosive agent composed of a benzotriazole-based compound is additionally added to the ink. However, a problem exists in this case also in that the formation of a precipitate in the ink is observed.",
        "The present invention has been developed to solve the problems inherent in the conventional technology. It is an object of the present invention to provide an ink for ink-jet recording in which, although a copper phthalocyanine dye is used and a thiazole-based compound is also used, the mildew resistant properties of the ink are not impaired, the ink exhibits excellent ozone resistance, and the formation of a precipitate in the ink is prevented.",
        "The present inventors have found that the above object can be achieved by employing a copper phthalocyanine dye having a specific structure and by replacing a certain proportion of the total counter ions in the dye with ammonium ions or organic ammonium ions. Therefore, the invention has been completed.",
        "Accordingly, the present invention provides an ink for ink-jet recording, containing a copper phthalocyanine dye and a thiazole-based compound,",
        "wherein the copper phthalocyanine dye has a structure represented by the general formula (1):",
        "wherein, in the general formula (1), Pc(Cu) represents a copper phthalocyanine nucleus represented by the general formula (2),\n\nwherein, in the general formula (1), k is a number satisfying 0<k<8; l is a number satisfying 0<l<8;\n\nm is a number satisfying 0\u2266m<8; n is a number satisfying 0\u2266n<8; k, l, m and n satisfy 4\u2266k+l+m+n\u22668; and R1, R2, R3 and R4 each independently represent a substituent selected from \u2014SO2\u2014Ra, \u2014SO2NRbRc and \u2014CO2\u2014Ra, provided that R1, R2, R3 and R4 are not simultaneously the same, that at least one of R1, R2, R3 and R4 has an ionic hydrophilic group as a substituent, and that at least one or more of R1, R2, R3 and R4 is present on each of four benzene rings A, B, C and D of the copper phthalocyanine nucleus represented by the general formula (2), wherein Ra represents a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group; Rb represents a hydrogen atom, or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group; and Rc represents a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, and",
        "wherein about 1 mol % to about 20 mol % of total counter ions in the copper phthalocyanine dye are ammonium ions or organic ammonium ions.",
        "The ink for ink-jet recording of the present invention contains a copper phthalocyanine dye and a thiazole-based compound. In the present invention, the copper phthalocyanine dye has a structure represented by the general formula (1) above. Therefore, the ink exhibits good ozone resistance, although at present the reason for this is unclear. Furthermore, in the copper phthalocyanine dye employed in the present invention, about 1 mol % to about 20 mol %, and preferably about 1 mol % to about 15 mol %, of the total counter ions in the structure are ammonium ions (NH4+) or organic ammonium ions. This is because, when the amount of ammonium ions or organic ammonium ions is less than 1 mol % based on the total amount of the counter ions in the dye, the formation of a precipitate, which may be caused by the thiazole-based compound, cannot be suppressed, causing a reduction in ejection stability. Conversely, when the amount of ammonium ions or organic ammonium ions exceeds 20 mol %, the risk of forming a precipitate originating from a rubber member increases. However, when about 1 mol % to about 20 mol % of the total counter ions in the dye are ammonium ions or organic ammonium ions, the formation of a precipitate can be suppressed even when an anticorrosive agent composed of a benzotriazole-based compound is also employed in the ink.",
        "In this instance, the organic ammonium ion is an ammonium ion in which one to four of the hydrogen atoms of NH4+ are replaced by alkyl groups (for example, methyl groups, ethyl groups and the like) or hydroxyalkyl groups (for example, hydroxyethyl groups and the like). Examples of the organic ammonium ion include, but not limited to, a monomethylammonium ion, a dimethylammonium ion, a trimethylammonium ion, a tetramethylammonium ion and the like.",
        "In the ink for ink-jet recording of the present invention, the amount of the copper phthalocyanine dye having the structure represented by the general formula (1) is appropriately determined depending on the performance and required characteristics of the ink. Preferably, the amount of the dye based on the total weight of the ink for ink-jet recording is in the range of about 0.1 wt % to about 5 wt %. Furthermore, another dye may also be employed within the range which does not impair the effect of the invention.",

Furthermore, at least one or more of R1, R2, R3 and R4 is present on each of the four benzene rings A, B, C and D of the copper phthalocyanine nucleus represented by the general formula (2). Ra represents a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, and Rb represents a hydrogen atom, or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group. Furthermore, Rc represents a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group. k is a number satisfying 0<k<8, l is a number satisfying 0<l<8, m is a number satisfying 0\u2266m<8, and n is a number satisfying 0\u2266n<8.

        "A production method of the copper phthalocyanine dye represented by the general formula (1) will now be described below. Generally, when an unsubstituted phthalocyanine compound is sulfonated according to a method described in Published Japanese Translation of PCT International Application No. 2002-526589 (WO00/17275), a sulfo group can be relatively easily introduced into the phthalocyanine nucleus. When a sulfonated phthalocyanine compound is employed as a water soluble dye, a salt of the sulfo group is formed using an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, and the obtained sulfonate can be used as a dye without further treatment. In this case, the sulfonation can occur at any position in the phthalocyanine nucleus, and it is difficult to control the number of introduced sulfo groups. Therefore, when sulfonation is carried out under reaction conditions in which the position and number of introduced sulfo groups are not taken into account and in which only the ease of sulfonation is taken into account, the position and number of the sulfo groups introduced into the product are difficult to identify. Thus, a mixture is obtained in which the number of substituents and the substitution positions are not uniform. Hence, in order to improve the ozone resistance of the copper phthalocyanine dye, any product having poor ozone resistance must be prevented from being mixed. Therefore, it is essential that a specific substituent be introduced into a phthalic acid derivative in advance to synthesize both the copper phthalocyanine from this substituted phthalic acid derivative and a copper derivative such as CuCl2. A method for synthesizing copper phthalocyanine from a phthalic acid derivative and a copper derivative is described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-303009 and the like.",

        "The substituent of the substituted phthalic acid derivatives is a soluble group or a precursor thereof. The soluble group is a substituent which imparts solubility to a copper phthalocyanine dye. When a soluble group imparts water solubility to a copper phthalocyanine dye, the soluble group is a hydrophilic group. Examples of the hydrophilic group include, but not limited to, an ionic hydrophilic group and a substituent substituted by an ionic hydrophilic group. The precursor of a soluble group is a substituent which can be converted to a soluble group through a reaction after a phthalocyanine ring is formed. Preferably, the substituent of the substituted phthalic acid derivatives is a substituent selected from \u2014SO2\u2014Ra, \u2014SO2NRbRc and \u2014CO2\u2014Ra. In this instance, Ra represents a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, and Rb represents a hydrogen atom or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group. Furthermore, Rc represents a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group.",
        "",
        "The phthalic acid derivatives are typified by compounds a to h. A phthalic acid derivative is mixed with a metal derivative such as CuCl2 in a molar ratio (metal derivative:phthalic acid derivative) of 3:1 to 6:1. Then, the mixture is reacted at a temperature ranging from 80\u00b0 C. to 300\u00b0 C. in the presence of an organic solvent having a boiling point of 80\u00b0 C. or higher and preferably 130\u00b0 C. or higher. When the reaction temperature is lower than 80\u00b0 C., the reaction rate may be significantly decreased. Conversely, when the reaction temperature exceeds 300\u00b0 C., the phthalocyanine dye obtained may be decomposed. In this case, the reaction time is preferably 2 hours to 20 hours. When the reaction time is less than 2 hours, a large amount of the raw materials may remain unreacted. Conversely, when the reaction time exceeds 20 hours, the phthalocyanine dye obtained may be decomposed. This reaction may be carried out in the presence of a catalyst such as 1,8-diazabicyclo [5.4.0]-7-undecene (DBU) or ammonium molybdate and the like. Replacement can be carried out, for example, according to the following method: the original cation is removed through dialysis; and then a monovalent metal cation is added (for example, an alkali metal hydroxide is added). After completion of the reaction, the reaction product containing the copper phthalocyanine dye represented by the general formula (1) without containing any ammonium ion and any organic ammonium ion is treated with an aqueous ammonia or an aqueous solution of organic ammonium hydroxide so that about 1 mol % to about 20 mol % of the total counter ions in the structure of the copper phthalocyanine dye are ammonium ions or organic ammonium ions.
