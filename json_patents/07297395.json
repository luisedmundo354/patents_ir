    "abstract": "The present invention relates to water swellable, water insoluble superabsorbent materials having controlled variable gel-bed friction angles. Controlling the gel-bed friction angle of the superabsorbent materials may allow control of the swelling of the material, the absorbency of the material, and/or the absorbency, resiliency, and porosity of the absorbent composite containing the superabsorbent material. The present invention relates to treatments for superabsorbent materials to manipulate friction angle and new superabsorbent materials having the desired friction angle characteristics. The present invention also relates to absorbent composites employing superabsorbent materials having the desired friction angle characteristics.",

        "People rely on absorbent articles in their daily lives.",
        "Absorbent articles, including adult incontinence articles, feminine care articles, and diapers, are generally manufactured by combining a substantially liquid-permeable topsheet; a substantially liquid-impermeable backsheet attached to the topsheet; and an absorbent core located between the topsheet and the backsheet. When the article is worn, the liquid-permeable topsheet is positioned next to the body of the wearer. The topsheet allows passage of bodily fluids into the absorbent core. The liquid-impermeable backsheet helps prevent leakage of fluids held in the absorbent core. The absorbent core is designed to have desirable physical properties, e.g. a high absorbent capacity and high absorption rate, so that bodily fluids may be transported from the skin of the wearer into the disposable absorbent article.",
        "The present invention relates to water swellable, water insoluble superabsorbent materials, which are often employed in an absorbent core (also referred to as an absorbent composite), in part to help \u201clock up\u201d fluids entering the core. More specifically, the present invention pertains to superabsorbent materials having a modified friction angle measured in a gel-bed of the superabsorbent material. The gel-bed friction angle of the superabsorbent materials of the present invention is controllable and follows a predetermined pattern. The present invention also relates to use of the controlled gel-bed friction angle superabsorbent materials in absorbent composites and absorbent articles incorporating such absorbent composites. Controlling the gel-bed friction angle of the superabsorbent materials may allow control of phenomena including, but not limited to: the swelling of the superabsorbent material, stresses experienced by the superabsorbent material and/or other ingredients (e.g., fibers) in an absorbent composite; the permeability of an absorbent composite containing the superabsorbent material; and/or, the absorbency, resiliency, and porosity of the absorbent composite. The present invention relates to treatments for superabsorbent materials to manipulate gel-bed friction angle and new superabsorbent materials having the desired gel-bed friction angle characteristics.",
        "Absorbent composites used in absorbent articles typically consist of an absorbent material, such as a superabsorbent material, mixed with a composite matrix containing natural and/or synthetic fibers. As fluids enter the absorbent composite, the superabsorbent material swells as it absorbs the fluids. The superabsorbent material contacts the surrounding matrix components and possibly other superabsorbent material as it swells. The full swelling capacity of the superabsorbent material may be reduced due to stresses acting on the superabsorbent materials (e.g., stresses imposed by the matrix on superabsorbent material; external stresses acting on the absorbent composite that comprises a matrix and superabsorbent material, including, for example, stresses imposed on an absorbent composite by a wearer during use; stresses imposed by one portion of the superabsorbent material on another portion of the superabsorbent material, whether directly or indirectly; etc.). Furthermore, stresses acting on an absorbent composite comprising the superabsorbent material may act to reduce interstitial pore volume, i.e., space between superabsorbent material, fibers, other ingredients, or some combination thereof (without being bound to a particular analogy, and for purposes of explanation only, think of a force acting on some unit area of a sponge-like material with pores, with the force per unit area\u2014i.e., stress\u2014acting to reduce the thickness of the sponge-like material, and, therefore, the volume of the pores).",
        "As the superabsorbent material swells, it may rearrange into void spaces of the absorbent composite matrix as well as expand readily against the matrix to create additional void space. Also, as the superabsorbent material swells, stresses acting within and/or on the absorbent composite may increase due\u2014at least in part\u2014to expansion of the superabsorbent material, thereby reducing the pore volume between: fibers, superabsorbent material, other ingredients in the absorbent composite, or some combination there of. The ability to rearrange within the composite matrix, and the magnitude and extent of the stresses acting within and on the composite matrix, depend on several factors specifically including a gel-bed friction angle of the superabsorbent material. In addition, as the superabsorbent material moves within the composite matrix, the superabsorbent material may contact the components, such as fibers and binding materials, of the surrounding matrix. Thus, the frictional properties of the superabsorbent material may influence the ability of the material to swell and rearrange or move within the matrix, as well as the magnitude and extent of the stresses acting within and on the composite matrix.",
        "It is often desired that the superabsorbent material be able to rotate and translate within the voids of the absorbent composite to allow the superabsorbent material to swell as close to full swelling capacity as is possible within the matrix. There is a need for a superabsorbent material which may more easily rearrange within the void space of the absorbent composite matrix. There is a need for a way to control the physical mechanics that: allow the superabsorbent material to rearrange within the absorbent composite matrix; reduce or minimize the stresses acting within or on the absorbent composite or its ingredient(s); and/or reduce the reduction in pore volume that may accompany the build up of said stresses.",
        "We have discovered that superabsorbent materials having controlled gel-bed friction angles meet one or more of these needs. Accordingly, the present invention is directed to superabsorbent materials having controlled gel-bed friction angles. The superabsorbent materials of the present invention have gel-bed friction angles that follow controlled gel-bed friction angle patterns substantially different than gel-bed friction angle patterns followed by conventional superabsorbent materials. The superabsorbent materials of the present invention may be produced using non-conventional manufacturing processes to obtain desired gel-bed friction angles or by treating with friction angle increasing additives and/or friction angle reducing additives to increase, decrease, or otherwise control the friction angle of the superabsorbent gel-bed during swelling. Gel-bed friction angle is a property of a gel-bed or superabsorbent material coming from Mohr-Coulomb failure theory. A lower friction angle implies lower inter-particle friction.",
        "The superabsorbent material of the present invention may be a water swellable, water insoluble superabsorbent material. The water swellable, water insoluble superabsorbent material may have a first gel-bed friction angle at a superabsorbent material swelling level of about 2.0 grams of 0.9 weight percent sodium chloride solution/gram of the superabsorbent material and gel-bed friction angles, at superabsorbent material swelling levels greater than about 2.0 grams of 0.9 weight percent sodium chloride solution/gram of the superabsorbent material, substantially equal to or less than the first gel-bed friction angle. The first gel-bed friction angle may be about 20 degrees or less. In other embodiments, the gel-bed friction angles may be greater than the first gel-bed friction angle. The superabsorbent material of the present invention may be utilized in an absorbent composite further comprising a plurality of wettable fibers.",

        "Absorbent articles and composites are porous by nature. The open space between the various ingredients that make up the composite (e.g., superabsorbent material and fibers) is commonly referred to as void space or pore space. Pore space acts to store liquids and/or provide a conduit or pathway for transporting liquid throughout the absorbent composite or article. The volume of pore space per unit volume of absorbent composite is commonly referred to as \u201cporosity.\u201d Generally absorbency performance is improved by increasing porosity. For example, permeability of an absorbent composite\u2014i.e., the ability of the composite to facilitate liquid transport\u2014increases with increasing porosity (other factors, such as specific surface area and tortuosity, being equal).",
        "The application of a stress to a porous medium, such as an absorbent composite or article, is known to cause a volumetric deformation of the medium as a whole, as well as shear deformation in the case of anisotropic stresses. FIG. 1 depicts an example of a volumetric deformation of a porous medium. The left-most image of FIG. 1 is labeled \u201cHigher Porosity\u201d 10 and shows a porous medium 12 without a weight applied to the uppermost planar surface 14 of the porous medium 12 (with the uppermost planar area having some discrete area): The right-most image of FIG. 1 is labeled \u201cLower Porosity\u201d 16 and shows the same porous medium 12\u2032 with a weight 18 applied to the uppermost planar surface 14\u2032 of the porous medium 12\u2032. In response to the placement of the weight 18, which produces a stress, or normal force per unit area, \u03c3 20, the thickness decreases (as denoted by \u0394 L 22). (Note: for purposes of the present invention, compressive stresses are represented as having positive values.)",
        "For a porous medium 12 made up of individual ingredients such as superabsorbent particles and fibers (e.g., an absorbent composite), the thickness change of the porous medium 12 as a whole, \u0394 L 22, likely does not result from a reduction in the individual dimensions of individual particles and fibers (reductions in these individual thicknesses would likely be small or negligible). Instead, the decrease in the thickness of the porous medium 12 as a whole, \u0394 L 22, results from a reduction in porosity (or, analogously, void volume). Accordingly, in the example depicted in FIG. 1, an increase in stress, or normal force per unit area, \u03c3 22, reduces the thickness \u0394 L 22 of the porous medium 12 as a whole, and reduces the porosi fluid in the pores is a compressible gas, then a normal stress acting on the surface of the porous medium 12 would: compress the gas within the pores; or cause a portion of the gas within the pores to exit the porous medium 12; or, some combination thereof. If, in this same FIG. 1, a fluid in the pores is an incompressible liquid, then a normal stress acting on the surface of the porous medium 12 would cause a portion of the liquid to exit the porous medium 12.)",
        "The porous medium 12 of FIG. 1 may be examined further to analyze the stresses acting on an arbitrary element within the porous medium 12. FIG. 2 illustrates the state of stress of an arbitrary element 30\u2014here represented by the face of a cube\u2014at equilibrium (the arbitrary element is within a porous medium 32 being subjected to an external stress \u03c3external 34). For present purposes, the arbitrary element 30 within the porous medium 32 is treated as a continuum. In FIG. 2, the state of stress is represented by two normal components of stress, \u03c3h 36 acting horizontally on a face of the cube and \u03c3, 38 acting vertically on another face of the cube, as well as a shear stress \u03c4 40. The normal components of stress 36 are perpendicular to the faces of the arbitrary element 30, whereas the shear stresses 40 are parallel to the faces of the arbitrary element 10.",
        "It should be noted that if the shear stresses 40 are zero (i.e., \u03c4=0), then the two normal stresses 36 are referred to as principal stresses. Furthermore, when \u03c4=0, then the larger of the two normal stresses 36 is called the major principal stress while the other is called the minor principal stress. For the present discussion, the two stresses are assumed to be principal stresses, with \u03c3h\u2267\u03c3v.",
        "There are generally at least two contributions to stress generation that combine to produce principal stresses such as those identified in FIG. 2. The first is an external stress 34, possibly non-uniform, acting on the boundary of the porous medium 32. This stress is transmitted throughout the porous medium 32 in accordance with well known force-balance equations. The second contribution arises due to swelling of components that make up the porous medium 32 (e.g., a superabsorbent material). For example, the swelling of blocks, or elements, immediately adjacent to the arbitrary element 30 depicted in FIG. 2, will cause an \u201cinternally\u201d generated stress acting on or along the arbitrary element 30 as other elements attempt to expand against it and each other.",
        "As stated above, when the stresses acting on an arbitrary element 30, such as that depicted in FIG. 2, are principal stresses, there are no shear stresses 40 acting on the faces of the arbitrary element 30. There is, however, shear stress 40 acting on other imaginary planes passing through the depicted arbitrary element 30\u2014planes oriented at some angle \u03b1 50 away from horizontal, 0<\u03b1<90\u00b0, as shown in FIG. 3. FIG. 3 depicts a major principal stress \u03c3h 52 acting on a major principal plane 54, and a minor principal stress \u03c3v 56 acting on a minor principal plane 58. A normal stress \u03c3n\u03b1 60 and a shear stress \u03c4\u03b1 62 act on the imaginary or arbitrary plane 64 oriented at angle \u03b1 50 away from horizontal.",
        "Obtaining the shear and normal forces 62 and 60, respectively, acting on the arbitrary plane 64 passing through the element 66 depicted in FIG. 3 is simplified by using the graphical approach of the Mohr circle, as illustrated in FIG. 4. FIG. 4 shows a plot of shear stress (y-axis) 70 as a function of normal stress (x-axis) 72. For purposes of the present discussion the principal stresses are assumed to be known (e.g., by calculation or measurement). The x-y coordinates of the minor principal stress \u03c3v 74 and the major principal stress \u03c3h 76 lie on the x-axis (i.e., where the shear stress \u03c4 70 is equal to zero). A semi-circle 78 is drawn such that the coordinates of the minor and major principal stresses 74 and 76, respectively, correspond to the end points of the arc defining the perimeter of the semi-circle 78. The radius of this semi-circle 78 equals one-half of the difference between the major principal stress \u03c3h 76 and the minor principal stress \u03c3v 74. By constructing a radial line segment 80 at an angle 2\u03b1 82 from the x-axis, with one end of the radial line segment 80 corresponding to the center of the semi-circle 78, and other end corresponding to a point on the semi-circle arc closest to the major principal stress, both the normal stress, \u03c3n\u03b184, and the shear stress \u03c4\u03b1 86 are obtained at the intersection 88 of the radial line segment 80 with the Mohr semi-circle 78.",
        "FIG. 5 depicts one example of stress evolution for a porous medium that employs one or more swelling components (e.g., a particulate superabsorbent material). The y-axis again corresponds to shear stress \u03c4 100, and the x-axis again corresponds to normal stress \u03c3 102. If the minor principal stress \u03c4v 104 acting on an arbitary element from the porous medium remains unchanged, then stress development (which would accompany, for example, swelling of superabsorbent material) may be viewed as a family of Mohr circles 106, 108,110, and 112, all of which have the same minor principal stress \u03c3v 104. The progression of the Mohr circles 106, 108, 110, and 112 is commonly referred to as a stress path 114\u2014more precisely, the line passing through the set of the Mohr circles 106, 108, 110, and 112 at points simultaneously locating the maximum shear stress and mean stress for each Mohr circle 106, 108, 110, and 112.",
        "The center of each Mohr circle 106,108, 110, and 112, which equates to the mean stress, determines the extent of the volumetric deformation of pore space contained within a particular arbitrary element, and may correspond to the approximate stress experienced by superabsorbent materials.",
        "Stresses in a porous medium are not likely to increase indefinitely\u2014rather, failure will take place, accompanied by sliding along particular failure planes (e.g., at the interface between superabsorbent material and fiber; or at the interface between individual particles of superabsorbent material; etc.). The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion states that a shear force acting on a plane at failure will be linearly proportional to the normal force acting on that same plane, again at failure. Hence, Mohr-Coulomb theory provides a failure limit, or envelope, beyond which stable states of stress do not exist. If a line corresponding to this failure limit is superimposed on a plot of shear stress and normal stress depicting a Mohr circle 106, 108, 110, and 112 (which may be thought of as corresponding to a given state or degree of swelling for a porous medium employing a superabsorbent material), then the Mohr circle 106, 108, 110, and 112 may only increase in radius (e.g., by additional swelling of the porous medium and/or superabsorbent material employed by the porous medium) to the extent that it becomes tangent to this linear envelope.",
        "FIG. 6 depicts a linear failure envelope 120 on a plot of shear stress \u03c4 122 versus normal stress \u03c3 124. On this plot are depicted each Mohr circle having a different value of initial stress\u2014that is, two different values of the minor principal stress \u03c3v 130 and 130\u2032. The friction angle \u03c6 132 and cohesion c 134 are properties of a particular material (e.g., an absorbent composite comprising fiber and superabsorbent material; a gel bed of swollen, particulate superabsorbent material; etc.). The tangent of the friction angle \u03c6 132, which is equivalent to the coefficient of static friction from elementary physics, measures the extent to which an increasing normal force permits a larger maximum shear force. Cohesion c 134 represents the amount of shear stress a material will tolerate before failure in the absence of any normal force on the proposed failure plane. An increase in any one of the three parameters\u2014friction angle \u03c6 132, cohesion c 134, or minor principle stress \u03c3v 130 and 130\u2032\u2014will permit the development of larger stresses in a porous material\u2014i.e., a larger Mohr circle. Friction angle \u03c6 132 and cohesion c 134 are properties of the material and may be measured (e.g., using the test and methodology disclosed herein). FIG. 6 also depicts the mathematical relationship \u03c4ff=c+\u03c3nff (tan \u03c6) 136, which relates friction angle \u03c6 132, cohesion c 134, shear stress at failure \u03c4ff 138, and normal stress at failure \u03c3nff 140. (Note: for purposes of this disclosure, \u03c3nff is equivalent to \u03c3ff, with both terms referring to a normal stress acting on the failure plane at failure.) This relationship is described in more detail below in the Detailed Description section.",
        "As stated earlier, it is generally advantageous to minimize or decrease the reduction of porosity, or void volume, that results from the application of a compressive stress to an absorbent article. By choosing materials that limit stress increases (e.g., low, controlled gel-bed friction angle superabsorbent material) the magnitude of porosity reductions may be decreased. For example, low, controlled gel-bed friction angle superabsorbent material will promote the onset of failure before stresses rise to values that cause significant losses of porosity, and therefore permeability. An additional benefit of providing stress relief through low, controlled gel-bed friction angle materials is that such superabsorbent materials will retain a larger portion of their free-swell capacity\u2014since it is well known that superabsorbent capacity decreases with increasing loading.",
        "The present invention relates to water swellable, water insoluble superabsorbent materials and the use of the superabsorbents in absorbent composites of absorbent articles.",
        "Absorbent composites of absorbent articles typically contain superabsorbent material, in relatively high quantities in some cases, in various forms such as superabsorbent fibers and/or superabsorbent particles, homogeneously mixed with a matrix material, such as cellulose fluff pulp. The mixture of superabsorbent material and cellulose fluff pulp may be homogeneous throughout the absorbent composite or the superabsorbent material may be strategically located within the absorbent composite, such as forming a gradient within the fiber matrix. For example, more superabsorbent material may be present at one end of the absorbent composite than at an opposite end of the absorbent composite. Alternatively, more superabsorbent material may be present along a top surface of the absorbent composite than along a bottom surface of the absorbent composite or more superabsorbent material may be present along the bottom surface of the absorbent composite than along the top surface of the absorbent composite. One skilled in the art will appreciate the various embodiments available for absorbent composites. The water swellable, water insoluble superabsorbent materials of the present invention may be used in these and other various embodiments of absorbent composites.",
        "Absorbent composites typically include a matrix which contains the superabsorbent material. The matrix is often made from a fibrous material or foam material, but one skilled in the art will appreciate the various embodiments of the composite matrix. One such fibrous matrix is made of a cellulose fluff pulp. The cellulose fluff pulp suitably includes wood pulp fluff. The cellulose pulp fluff may be exchanged, in whole or in part, with synthetic, polymeric fibers (e.g., meltblown fibers). Synthetic fibers are not required in the absorbent composites of the present invention, but may be included. One preferred type of wood pulp fluff is identified with the trade designation CR1654, available from Bowater, Childersburg, Ala., U.S.A., and is a bleached, highly absorbent wood pulp containing primarily soft wood fibers. The cellulose fluff pulp may be homogeneously mixed with the superabsorbent material. Within the absorbent article, the homogeneously mixed fluff and superabsorbent material may be selectively placed into desired zones of higher concentration to better contain and absorb body exudates. For example, the mass of the homogeneously mixed fluff and superabsorbent materials may be controllably positioned such that more basis weight is present in a front portion of the pad than in a back portion of the pad.",
        "Absorbent composites of the present invention may suitably contain between about 5 to about 95 mass % of superabsorbent material, based on the total weight of the fiber, the superabsorbent material, and/or any other component. Optionally, the mass composition of the superabsorbent material in the absorbent composite may be from about 20 to about 80%. Additionally, the mass composition of the superabsorbent material in the absorbent composite may be from about 40 to about 60%.",
        "Suitable superabsorbent materials useful in the present invention may be selected from natural, synthetic, and modified natural polymers and materials. The superabsorbent materials may be inorganic materials, such as silica gels, or organic compounds, including natural materials such as agar, pectin, guar gum, and the like, as well as synthetic materials, such as synthetic hydrogel polymers. Such hydrogel polymers include, for example, alkali metal salts of polyacrylic acids; polyacrylamides; polyvinyl alcohol; ethylene maleic anhydride copolymers; polyvinyl ethers; hydroxypropylcellulose; polyvinyl morpholinone; polymers and copolymers of vinyl sulfonic acid, polyacrylates, polyacrylamides, polyvinyl pyridine; polyamines; and, combinations thereof. Other suitable polymers include hydrolyzed acrylonitrile grafted starch, acrylic acid grafted starch, and isobutylene maleic anhydride copolymers and combinations thereof. The hydrogel polymers are suitably lightly crosslinked to render the material substantially water-insoluble. Crosslinking may, for example, be by irradiation or by covalent, ionic, Van der Waals, or hydrogen bonding. The superabsorbent materials of the present invention may be in any form suitable for use in absorbent structures, including, particles, fibers, flakes, spheres, and the like.",
        "Typically, a superabsorbent polymer is capable of absorbing at least about 10 times its weight in a 0.9 weight percent aqueous sodium chloride solution, and particularly is capable of absorbing more than about 20 times its weight in 0.9 weight percent aqueous sodium chloride solution. Superabsorbent polymers suitable for treatment or modification in accordance with the present invention are available from various commercial vendors, such as Dow Chemical Company located in Midland, Mich., U.S.A., and Stockhausen Inc., Greensboro, N.C., USA. Other superabsorbent polymers suitable for treatment or modification in accordance with the present invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,601,542 issued Feb. 11, 1997, to Melius et al.; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/475,829 filed in December 1999 and assigned to Kimberly-Clark Corporation; and, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/475,830 filed in December 1999 and assigned to Kimberly-Clark Corporation; each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in a manner consistent herewith.",

Examples include FAVOR\u00ae SXM 77, FAVOR\u00ae SXM 880, and FAVOR\u00ae SXM 9543.

        "The superabsorbent materials of the present invention may be in the form of particles which, in the unswollen state, have maximum cross-sectional diameters typically within the range of from about 50 microns to about 1,000 microns, suitably within the range of from about 100 microns to about 800 microns, as determined by sieve analysis according to American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) Test Method D-1921. It is understood that the particles of superabsorbent material, falling within the ranges described above, may include solid particles, porous particles, or may be agglomerated particles including many smaller particles agglomerated into particles within the described size ranges.",
        "Absorbent composites may also contain any of a variety of chemical additives or treatments, fillers or other additives, such as clay, zeolites and/or other odor-absorbing material, for example activated carbon carrier particles or active particles such as zeolites and activated carbon. Absorbent composites may also include binding agents, such as crosslinkable binding agents or adhesives, and/or binder fibers, such as bicomponent fibers. Absorbent composites may or may not be wrapped or encompassed by a suitable tissue wrap that maintains the integrity and/or shape of the absorbent composite.",
        "The structure and components of absorbent composites are designed to take up fluids and absorb them. The porosity of the fiber matrix allows fluid to penetrate the absorbent composite and contact the superabsorbent material, which absorbs the fluids. The superabsorbent material swells as the superabsorbent material absorbs fluids. The swelling of the superabsorbent material may be influenced by the external factors such as surrounding matrix material and pressures (i.e., a force per unit area, or stress) from the absorbent article user. The surrounding matrix fibers and/or superabsorbent materials and the pressures on the superabsorbent material may inhibit the swelling of the superabsorbent material, thus stopping absorbency, and thereby the absorbent composite, from reaching full free swell capacity. Also, as described above, stresses acting on an absorbent composite, such as an absorbent composite employing a superabsorbent material, may reduce porosity and/or permeability of the absorbent composite.",
        "To the extent possible during swelling, superabsorbent materials may move within the composite matrix to positions that allow the superabsorbent to obtain greater swelling. Superabsorbent materials may rotate and/or translate so as to fit within voids in the composite matrix which allows the absorbent particle to swell readily against surrounding matrix and reach greater swelling potentials. Moreover, additional voids/void space may be created by overall expansion of the absorbent composite. Upon moving within the fiber matrix, the superabsorbent materials will contact and rub against other components of the absorbent composite, including matrix fibers and/or other superabsorbent materials. The surface mechanics of the superabsorbent material and the surrounding matrix components may determine the amount of superabsorbent material structure rotation and/or translation and thus may affect: (1) the swelling capacity of the superabsorbent material, and therefore the absorbent composite; and (2) the level of stress buildup in an absorbent composite employing the superabsorbent, which in turn affects the porosity and permeability of the absorbent composite.",
        "The friction angle of the superabsorbent material is an important mechanical property that may affect the ability of the superabsorbent material to move or expand within the absorbent composite matrix. As discussed above in the Overview section, friction angle comes from Mohr-Coulomb failure theory, and the tangent of the friction angle is equivalent to the traditional coefficient of static friction. A smaller friction angle may indicate less contact friction between the superabsorbent material and the surrounding matrix, and a greater ability for the superabsorbent material to rearrange within the matrix during swelling so that the superabsorbent material may retain a greater portion of the free swell absorbent capacity. Also, a smaller friction angle may promote failure (i.e., movement between, for example, swollen particles of superabsorbent material; or movement between a swollen particle of superabsorbent material and the surrounding fiber matrix; etc.) at lower levels of stress buildup, thereby reducing losses in porosity and/or permeability in an absorbent composite.",
        "The state of failure between the surfaces of the superabsorbent material and the surrounding components allows the superabsorbent material to rearrange within the wet matrix or a partially swollen gel-bed. As indicated in the Overview Section, Mohr circles may be used to describe the state of stress of a material, such as a wet gel-bed or absorbent composite or porous medium. FIG. 7 shows representative Mohr circles 150 and 152 for a typical gel-bed swollen to a particular level. FIG. 7 shows Mohr circles 150 and 152 for the superabsorbent FAVOR\u00ae 9543 at a 2.0 grams saline solution/gram superabsorbent material swelling level. The larger Mohr circle 152 represents a situation where some pre-consolidation stress is imposed on the gel-bed, and the smaller Mohr circle 150 represents the situation where some major principal stress exists anywhere in the gel-bed while the minor principle stress is zero. Although not shown in FIG. 7, Mohr circles are produced at each applied normal stress. The state of failure for a superabsorbent material is described by the set of Mohr circles at failure which together define a Mohr failure envelope. The Mohr failure envelope is often very close to linear, shown in FIG. 7 as line 154, and represents the shear stress at failure, on the failure plane, versus the normal stress acting on the same plane. The linearized failure envelope 154, often referred to as the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, may be represented mathematically by the formula:\n\n\u03c4ff=c+\u03c3ff(tan \u03c6)\n\nwhere \u03c4ff is shear stress, c is the effective cohesion constant, \u03c3ff is normal stress, and \u03c6 is the friction angle of the gel-bed or superabsorbent material. The effective cohesion constant is represented on the graph by value 156 and pertains to the cohesion of the absorbent particle to the surrounding medium.",
        "The gel-bed friction angle of the superabsorbent materials of the present invention may be determined using various methods used in fields such as soil mechanics. Useful instruments for determining gel-bed friction angle include triaxial shear measurement instruments, such as a Sigma1, available from GeoTac, Houston, Tex., or ring shear testers such as the Jenike-Shulze Ring Shear Tester, available from Jenike & Johanson, Westford, Mass.",
        "FIG. 8 shows a partial cut-away schematic of a Jenike-Shulze Ring Shear Tester, designated as reference numeral 170. The ring shear tester 170 has a ring shear cell 172 connected to a motor (not shown) that may rotate the ring shear cell 172 in direction co. The ring shear cell 172 and lid 174 contain the superabsorbent material gel-bed 176 to be tested. The lid 174 is not fixed to the ring shear cell 172 and the crossbeam 178 crosses the lid 174 and connects two guiding rollers 180 and two tie rods 182 to lid 174. For measuring the gel-bed friction angle of swelled superabsorbent material gel-bed 176 the superabsorbent material is swelled outside the ring shear cell 172 and placed in the ring shear cell 172. A predetermined force N may be placed upon the lid 174, and therefore on the superabsorbent material 176, by a weight (not shown). A counterweight system (not shown) may be engaged to test at lower normal pressure. As the ring shear cell 172 rotates in direction \u03c9 by the computer controlled motor (not shown), a shear stress is placed on the superabsorbent material gel-bed 176 contacting the ring shear cell 172. An instrument connected to the tie rods 182 measures the forces F1 and F2, which are used to determine the shear stress at failure (for a given applied normal stress) of the superabsorbent material gel-bed 176.",
        "Superabsorbent material having a low gel-bed friction angle may be useful in absorbent composites. In one embodiment of the present invention, the superabsorbent material gel-bed friction angle decreases upon swelling to about 20 degrees or less at a superabsorbent material swelling level of about 2.0 grams of 0.9 weight percent aqueous sodium chloride solution/gram of superabsorbent material (gram/gram) and remains at about 20 degrees or less at swelling levels greater than 2.0 gram/gram. More suitably the superabsorbent material gel-bed friction angle decreases upon swelling to about 15 degrees or less at a superabsorbent material swelling level of about 2.0 grams of 0.9 weight percent aqueous sodium chloride solution/gram of superabsorbent material and remains at about 15 degrees or less at swelling levels greater than 2.0 gram/gram. More particularly, the superabsorbent material gel-bed friction angle decreases upon swelling to about 10 degrees or less at a superabsorbent material swelling level of about 2.0 grams of 0.9 weight percent aqueous sodium chloride solution/gram of superabsorbent material, and remains at about 10 degrees or less at swelling levels greater than 2.0 gram/gram",
        "The low gel-bed friction angle superabsorbent materials of the present invention reduce the local stresses between the superabsorbent materials and/or the surrounding matrix components, which may allow the superabsorbent material structures to rearrange within the voids of an absorbent composite matrix more easily. The low gel-bed friction angle superabsorbent materials may allow for the superabsorbent materials to obtain a greater portion of their free swell absorbent capacity. In addition, permeability is generally maintained at suitable values because the development of higher internal stresses is alleviated. As indicated above, the buildup of stresses may result in additional compression of pore space.",
        "Low superabsorbent material gel-bed friction angles may be obtained through non-conventional manufacturing processes that produce superabsorbent material structures possessing low-friction surfaces (e.g., smooth surfaces). Low superabsorbent material gel-bed friction angles may also be obtained by treatment of superabsorbent materials with friction angle reducing additives that decrease friction angle upon becoming wet. Examples of such friction angle reducing additives include, without limitation, glycerol, oils such as mineral oil and silicone oil, oleic acid, polysaccharides, polyethylene oxides.",

        "Small concentrations of emulsifiers and/or surfactants in addition to the friction angle reducing additives, and friction angle reducing additive mixtures such as a 50/50 by weight mixture of glycerol and mineral oil, may help reduce the gel-bed friction angle of the superabsorbent materials.

This is done so as to distribute the swelling solution uniformly to all the superabsorbent material. When all solution is absorbed by the superabsorbent material (absorption time: 0-30 minutes), the bowl is removed from the blender, covered so as to prevent evaporation and allowed to equilibrate for one hour so that the fluid is distributed evenly throughout each particle. The sample is manually mixed every fifteen minutes to ensure that no clumps are formed.",

        "The gel-bed friction angle and effective cohesion measurements are determined by using the Jenike-Schulze Ring Shear Tester apparatus. The Jenike-Schulze Ring Shear Tester is used to obtain the gel-bed friction angle values of superabsorbent material gel-beds at various swelling levels. The Ring Shear Tester is operated and calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions provided. A sample is loaded into the ring shear cell (Volume Ring Cell\u2014standard: 942.48 cm3) while ensuring the superabsorbent gel-bed is distributed evenly (see above table). After one hour of assumed equilibration with 0.9 weight percent sodium chloride solution is achieved, the ring shear cell is filled with the bulk superabsorbent material to be tested (see above table). Even filling may be obtained by removing excess material with a spatula, without compressing the superabsorbent material. The superabsorbent material gel-bed is suitably flush with the top of the ring shear cell. The weight of the filled ring shear cell (without the lid) is determined on a mass balance and recorded. The samples described below were tested by the ring shear tester control program (RSTCTRL) for 1-2 hours. On request from RSTCTRL, the filled shear cell is securely placed on the driving axle. The lid is placed on the ring shear cell and positioned a few degrees counterclockwise from the shear position; the ring shear tester pre-sets this start position. The handle of the counterweight should be on the right side of the crossbeam, and the hook on the crossbeam should be facing the handle. On request from RSTCTRL, the counter weight and the hanger are hooked to the central axis of the crossbeam. The tie rods are attached on each side of the crossbeam, and the ring shear cell is adjusted so that the tie rods are not stressed. The RST-Control offers the possibility to adjust the shear cell with arrow keys: \u2190\u2192, and using: \u2191\u2193 to stop when positioned properly.",
        "During the test procedure, the pressures at which the sample is pre-sheared are read from a control file. In the sample tests described below, the pre-shearing normal pressure is set at 3000 Pascals and the pre-sheared/pre-consolidated gel-bed is then sheared to failure, to obtain the Mohr-Coulomb envelope, at a range of normal pressures ranging from 500 Pascals to 2500 Pascals. Pre-shearing precedes each shearing measurement. Thus, every superabsorbent material gel-bed is sheared twice at any shearing normal pressure in one experiment. Sometimes the equipment needs to be run in semiautomatic mode and the data point is obtained manually. After the samples below were completed, the results were analyzed using RSV 95, Version 1.0; the software package included with the ring shear tester.",

A coating material of mineral oil, (from Sample 2), glycerol (from Sample 1), and sorbitan monolaurate (from Sample 7) in a ratio of 1.0 gram additive/coating per 2.0 gram of swollen superabsorbent material was applied to each of the swollen superabsorbent samples. The coating additive was a mixture containing 0.8 grams of glycerol and 0.2 grams of mineral oil for every 1.0 grams of additive mixture plus 0.01 grams of sorbitan monolaurate per 1.0 grams of swollen superabsorbent material. The additive was then mixed into the superabsorbent material (previously swollen) for about 2 minutes and there was little or no additive mixture adhered to the side of the mixing bowl.
