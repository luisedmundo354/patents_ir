        "FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing a configuration of the swing analyzing apparatus shown in FIG. 1. Referring to FIG. 2, swing analyzing apparatus 1 analyzes the swing of a golfer 2 when hitting a ball 4 using a golf club 3. Swing analyzing apparatus 1 includes high-speed cameras 1A and 1B, a high-speed video tape recorder 1C, a meta-hexa light 1D, a stroboscope power source 1E, and a stroboscope IF.",

The number of frame of high-speed cameras 1A and 1B is, for example, 1/200 sec. The outputs of high-speed cameras 1A and 1B are recorded by high-speed video tape recorder 1C. In order to illuminate golfer 2 and ball 4, meta-hexa light 1D is used. In order to provide stroboscopic illumination to golfer 2, stroboscope 1F connected to stroboscope power source 1E is provided. Before golfer 2 starts swinging, stroboscope 1F is activated by stroboscope power source 1E and emits light. Stroboscope 1F is activated by a recording button of high-speed video tape recorder 1C being pressed.",
        "High-speed video tape recorder 1C is connected to displaying apparatus 500 through selecting unit 400 that is a computer having CPU. The image recorded with high-speed video tape recorder 1C is displayed on displaying apparatus 500.",
        "Next, an operation of swing analyzing apparatus 1 is described. First, the recording button of high-speed video tape recorder 1C is operated to start recording. Here, stroboscope 1F emits light by stroboscope power source 1E. When golfer 2 swings golf club 3, the image around ball 4 is shot by high-speed camera 1A, and the image around top-of-swing (the position at which a club head comes to rest above the head of the golfer) is shot by high-speed camera 1B. The images shot by high-speed cameras 1A and 1B are recorded with high-speed video tape recorder 1C. When swinging again, high-speed video tape recorder 1C is paused and the same operation is repeated. When finishing the swing measurement, the recording with high-speed video tape recorder 1C is stopped.",
        "Next, the tape is rewound to replay the image recorded with high-speed video tape recorder 1C on displaying apparatus 500. By a frame-advance operation, a swing start time point and an impact time point are detected. Thus, a \u201cswing time period\u201d from the swing start to the impact is detected. The \u201cswing time period\u201d can be one indication of the \u201cswing tempo\u201d. By the frame-advance operation, the head speed at impact can be detected.",
        "FIG. 3 shows a movement of a golf club around top-of-swing by frame advance (0.01 second intervals). The image shown in FIG. 3 is shot by high-speed camera 1B. Referring to FIG. 3, golf club 3 is positioned at \u201cA2\u201d at 0.1 second before a top-of-swing time point, then moves in a direction of arrow DR1, and thereafter reaches top-of-swing position \u201cA1\u201d. Thereafter, golf club 3 moves in a direction of arrow DR2 and goes to the impact position.",
        "By analyzing the image shown in FIG. 3, a moving speed (\u201cswing speed\u201d) of a club head at a predetermined time before (for example, 0.08 seconds before) reaching top-of-swing can be detected. Similarly, a club head acceleration (\u201cswing acceleration\u201d) around top-of-swing can also be detected. The \u201cswing speed\u201d and \u201cswing acceleration\u201d can be indications of the \u201cswing tempo\u201d.",
        "FIG. 4 is a block diagram showing a configuration of a modification of the swing analyzing apparatus shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 5 shows a golf club used in swing analysis with the swing analyzing apparatus shown in FIG. 4, while FIG. 6 shows a VI-VI cross section in FIG. 5. Referring to FIG. 4, swing analyzing apparatus 1 according to the present modification includes deformation gages 1G attached to club shaft 5, a bridge box 1H and an amplifier 1I. As shown in FIG. 5, deformation gages 1G are respectively arranged at a plurality of deformation gage attaching positions 10G-13G provided along the longitudinal direction of club shaft 5. Additionally, as shown in FIG. 6, deformation gages 1G are attached to club shaft 5 at a side in the target line direction (x-axis direction) and a side in a direction perpendicular to the target line direction (y-axis direction). From a composite deformation amount, which is a composite of a deformation amount in the x-axis direction and that in the y-axis direction, a deflection amount of golf club shaft 5 can be determined.",
        "Referring back to FIG. 4, with deformation gages 1G, a deformation amount of club shaft 5 during a swing is detected. The detected deformation amount is sent to selecting unit 400 that is a computer having CPU through bridge box 1H and amplifier 1I, and displayed on displaying apparatus 500. Thus, variations in a deflection amount of a club shaft 5 during a swing is measured. The deflection amount of club shaft 5 takes on the maximum value around top-of-swing. This \u201cmaximum deflection amount\u201d can be an indication of the \u201cswing tempo\u201d. It should be noted that, in general, the preferable \u201cmaximum deflection amount\u201d during a swing is about 70-130 mm (more preferably, about 100 mm).",
        "As described above, in the golf club selecting system according to the present embodiment, the swing tempo of a golfer is detected based on any of the maximum deflection amount (the maximum deformation amount) of a shaft during a swing, the swing time period, the club head speed (swing speed) at a predetermined time before reaching top-of-swing, and the club head acceleration (swing acceleration) around the top-of-swing. The \u201cswing tempo\u201d that is necessary for selecting a golf club shaft can precisely be detected using any of those parameters.",
        "As for head speed detecting unit 100, a measurement apparatus that is commercially available can be used.",
        "On the other hand, a correction of the measurement result is necessary, as the head speed may be measured faster or slower depending on each measurement apparatus.",
        "FIG. 7 is a flowchart describing a golf club shaft selecting method according to the present embodiment. Referring to FIG. 7, at S10, the head speed at impact and the swing tempo in a swing are measured. This measurement is performed using, for example, swing analyzing apparatus 1 shown in FIGS. 2 and 4.",
        "Next, at S20, the characteristics of the swing of the golfer are classified based on the measurement result of swing analyzing apparatus 1. That is, to which group, among a plurality of groups prepared in advance, the head speed and swing tempo of the golfer belong is determined.",
        "At S30, based on the classification result above, a club shaft corresponding to the swing characteristics (the head speed and the swing tempo) of the golfer is selected. Here, chart 300, which has first chart 310 indicative of a preferable shaft mass according to the head speed at impact and the swing tempo and second chart 320 indicative of a preferable shaft flex point according to the head speed at impact and the swing tempo, is referred to. It is noted that the golf club shaft(s) selected at S30 may be one or may be plural (for example, two or three).",
        "Subsequently, at S40, a golf club having the selected club shaft is selected. Then, at S50, trial hitting with the selected golf club is performed. At S60, the golf club with which the trial hitting was performed is evaluated. Here, for example objective data such as \u201chead speed\u201d, \u201cball speed\u201d, \u201cstriking ability\u201d, \u201cball spin amount\u201d, \u201claunch angle\u201d, \u201cvariations in hitting position\u201d, \u201cvariations in trajectory\u201d, as well as the feeling of a golfer such as \u201ceasy to adjust timing/hard to adjust timing\u201d \u201ceasy to swing/hard to swing\u201d can be used as criterion for evaluation.",
        "As a result of the evaluation at S60, when the golfer is fully satisfied, the series of selection steps end. When the golfer is not fully satisfied, the process goes back to S40 again. In other words, another golf club having the selected club shaft is selected, and trial hitting with this golf club is performed.",
        "Summarizing the above, the golf club shaft selecting method according to the present embodiment includes the steps of: detecting a head speed at impact in a swing of a golfer and a swing tempo of the golfer (S10); classifying the swing of the golfer based on a detection result from the step of detecting (S20); and selecting a golf club shaft having a shaft mass and a shaft flex point suitable for the golfer based on a classification result from the step of classifying (S30).",
        "The present inventors have confirmed the existence of a certain relationship between the swing type of a golfer (the head speed at impact and the swing tempo) and the shaft mass and the shaft flex point suitable for the golfer. Accordingly, by the club shaft selecting method above, an objective selection criterion can be obtained as to the shaft mass and the shaft flex point.",
        "Additionally, the present inventors have confirmed the immediate relationship between the flexural rigidity of the club shaft at the central portion in the longitudinal direction and the flexural rigidity of the club shaft at the grip portion, in selecting the shaft flex point corresponding to the swing characteristics of each golfer. Accordingly, by performing the classification of the shaft flex point to be the selection target based on the relationship between the slope of a flexural rigidity distribution of the shaft at a portion positioned on the club head side relative to the shaft central portion and the slope of a flexural rigidity distribution of the shaft at a portion positioned on the grip side relative to the shaft central portion, the selection of the shaft flex point more suitable for each golfer can be achieved.",
        "It should be noted that, while in the present embodiment, the description has mainly been provided as to the case where chart 300 has first chart 310 indicative of a preferable shaft mass corresponding to the head speed at impact and the swing tempo and second chart 320 indicative of a preferable shaft flex point corresponding to the head speed at impact and the swing tempo, chart 300 may have only first chart 310 or may have only second chart 320. When chart 300 has only first chart 310, selection of a club shaft having a shaft mass suitable for each golfer is supported, and when chart 300 has only second chart 320, selection of a club shaft having a shaft flex point suitable for each golfer is supported.",
        "FIG. 8 shows a distribution of outer diameter and flexural rigidity of a golf club shaft used in a golf club shaft selecting method according to one example of the present invention. The abscissa in FIG. 8 (and FIGS. 11-14) indicates the distance from the club head side end of a golf club shaft. In the example of FIG. 8, the outer diameter and flexural rigidity of a golf club increases from the club head side toward the grip side.",
        "FIG. 9 shows a distribution of head speed and swing tempo detected by the step of detecting in the golf club shaft selecting method according to the present example. In the present Example, measurement was performed using golf clubs (drivers and #6 irons) with golf club shafts having the outer diameter and flexural rigidity distribution shown in FIG. 8. FIG. 9 shows the result of measurements on the swing of at least 300 golfers. In FIG. 9, the flexes of shaft (X flex (#X), S flex (#S), SR flex (#SR), R (R1) flex (#R), A (R2) flex (#A), and L flex (#L)) suitable for each golfer are shown together. Referring to FIG. 9, a relatively stiff golf club shaft (such as X flex or S flex) is suitable for a golfer with fast head speed and fast swing tempo, while a relatively soft golf club shaft (such as A(R2) flex or L flex) is suitable for a golfer with slow head speed and slow swing tempo.",
        "As shown in FIG. 9, a correlation is not necessarily found between the swing tempo and the head speed (at impact). Accordingly, in classifying the swing characteristics of each golfer, both the swing tempo and the head speed must be considered.",
        "FIG. 10 is an explanatory graph of the classification of golfers by the swing characteristics. Referring to FIG. 10, each golfer is classified into groups a-d and groups A-D corresponding to the swing characteristics (the swing tempo and the head speed) of him/her. In FIG. 10, the NORMAL line indicates the line where the head speed, the swing tempo and the preference of shaft flex point are at the average level (how the NORMAL line was determined will be described later). Here, the golfers distributed in the upper left area relative to the NORMAL line (for example, those golfers included in group D) correspond to the golfers with \u201cslow swing tempo for the head speed\u201d. In FIG. 10, the golfers distributed in the lower right area relative to the NORMAL line (for example, those golfers included in group d) correspond to the golfers with \u201cfast swing tempo for the head speed\u201d. In FIG. 10, the golfers distributed on and around the NORMAL line correspond to the golfers at \u201cthe average level as to the relationship among the head speed, swing tempo and the shaft flex point\u201d, for example, the golfers of a boundary region belonging to any of groups A-C and groups a-c.",
        "FIGS. 11-14 show the flexural rigidity distribution of sample golf clubs. Examples in FIGS. 11-14 show different ratio between a slope of the flexural rigidity distribution of a portion positioned on the club head side relative to the shaft central portion (C0) and a slope of the flexural rigidity distribution of a portion positioned on the grip side relative to the shaft central portion (C0). Here, they are referred to as \u201cButt Stiff+(plus)\u201d (FIG. 11), \u201cButt Stiff\u201d (FIG. 12), \u201cButt Standard\u201d (FIG. 13), \u201cButt Standard\u2212(minus)\u201d (FIG. 14), in the descending order as to the magnitude of a slope of the flexural rigidity distribution of a portion positioned on the grip side against a slope of the flexural rigidity distribution of a portion positioned on the club head side. FIGS. 11-14 each show examples of S flex, SR flex, and R flex.",
        "In the present Example, a plurality of sample golf clubs were prepared to consider which sample was highly evaluated by golfers classified into each group (A-D, a-d). The list of the prepared sample golf clubs are shown in Table 1. Tables 2-5 show, for each sample golf club, the groups in which a relatively large number of (here, at least five) golfers selected the golf club for easier hitting (that is, highly evaluated).",
