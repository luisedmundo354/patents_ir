        "The present application is related to Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-002907 filed on Jan. 8, 2004 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an electrically-driven vehicle having a push-walk function.",
        "2. Description of Background Art",
        "An electrically-drive-assisted bicycle is disclosed in JP-A-2003-95182 which uses a resultant force of manpower and an assist power as a driving force. The electrically-drive-assisted bicycle is provided with a push-walk function which allows the bicycle to travel at a speed which is slower than a usual vehicle speed and is substantially equal to a speed that a man walks. The application of the push-walk function to an electrically-driven vehicle such as a scooter is hereinafter discussed. Here, the electrically-drive-assisted bicycle adopts the structure in which a one-way clutch or the like is interposed between a pedal crank and a drive shaft or between a motor and the drive shaft. Thus, even when the push-walk function is driven during usual traveling, the adjustment is configured to be performed between the speed of the pedal traveling using manpower and the speed of the push-walk function.",
        "However, since the electrically-operated scooter or the like uses the power of the electrically-operated motor as the main driving force, when the push-walk function is driven during usual traveling, the driving force of the electrically-operated motor is changed.",
        "The present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problem. It is an object of the present invention to provide an electrically-driven vehicle which allows the push walk only when a given condition is satisfied.",
        "The present invention is directed to an electrically-driven vehicle which includes an electrically-driven motor for driving a drive wheel. A battery is provided for supplying electric power to the electrically-driven motor. A throttle is provided for adjusting the vehicle speed. A control part is provided for controlling the electrically-driven motor based on an output of the throttle. The electrically-driven vehicle includes push-walk switch means for allowing a rider to instruct push-walk traveling and vehicle state detection means for detecting a state of a vehicle. The control part controls the electrically-driven motor in the push-walk traveling only when the control part receives an instruction from the push-walk switch means and when the vehicle state which is detected by the vehicle state detection means satisfies a preset condition.",
        "The control part is configured to receive the instruction from the push-walk switch means and to control the electrically-operated motor in the push walk traveling when the vehicle state satisfies the preset condition at the time of receiving the instruction. Accordingly, even when the push-walk switch means is manipulated by a rider when the vehicle state does not satisfy the preset condition, the control part maintains the usual traveling as it is.",
        "The present invention provides the control part that does not perform a control based on the output of the throttle during the exercise of the push-walk traveling.",
        "Since the control part is configured not to perform the control based on the output of the throttle during the exercise of the push-walk traveling, the control of the push-walk traveling can be continuously performed even when the rider opens the throttle during the push-walk traveling.",
        "The present invention provides that the preset condition is a condition wherein an opening of the throttle is not larger than a fixed value.",
        "Since the control part is configured not to perform the push-walk traveling unless the opening of the throttle is not larger than the fixed value, even when the push-walk switch means is manipulated by the rider in a state that the rider performs the traveling by opening the throttle, the control part can maintain the usual traveling as it is.",
        "The present invention provides that the preset condition is a condition wherein the vehicle speed is not larger than a fixed value.",
        "Since the control part is configured not to perform the push-walk traveling unless the vehicle speed is not larger than a fixed value, even when the push-walk switch means is manipulated by the rider in a state when the vehicle speed exceeds the fixed value, the control part can maintain the usual traveling as it is.",
        "The present invention provides the control part that does not receive the instruction from the push-walk switch means when the vehicle speed exceeds the fixed value.",
        "The control part is configured not to receive the instruction from the push-walk switch means when the vehicle speed exceeds the fixed value. Accordingly, when the vehicle speed exceeds the fixed value, that is, in case that the vehicle speed exceeds the fixed value, even when the push-walk switch is manipulated by the rider during the usual traveling, the control part is capable of preventing the occurrence of the lowering of the speed of the vehicle.",
        "The electrically-driven vehicle is configured to allow the push walk when the push-walk switch means is manipulated by the rider during a period in which the vehicle state assumes the preset state. Accordingly, even when the push-walk switch means is manipulated during the period in which the vehicle state does not assume the preset state, for example, during the usual traveling, it is possible to obtain an advantageous effect wherein the usual traveling can be continued as it is without shifting the state to the push-walk state.",
        "The electrically-driven vehicle is configured in another embodiment not to perform the control based on the throttle manipulation in the state that the push-walk traveling is performed. Accordingly, when the electrically-driven vehicle is in the push-walk traveling state, even when the throttle manipulation is performed by the rider or the like, it is possible to have an advantageous effect wherein the push-walk manipulation can be maintained as it is without shifting the traveling control to the traveling control based on the throttle manipulation (usual traveling control).",
        "The electrically-driven vehicle is configured in another embodiment to perform the control of push-walk traveling in response to the manipulation of the push-walk switch means which is performed by the rider when the opening of the throttle is in the state of being not more than a given value. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain an advantageous effect that the electrically-driven vehicle can be controlled not to perform the push-walk control even when the push-walk switch means is manipulated by the rider when the opening of the throttle is not less than the given value.",
        "The electrically-driven vehicle is configured in another embodiment to perform the control of push-walk traveling when the manipulation of push-walk switch means is performed by the rider in the state wherein the vehicle speed is not more than the given value. Accordingly, even when the manipulation of the push-walk switch means is performed by the rider when the vehicle speed is not smaller than the given value, for example, in the usual traveling state, it is possible to have an advantageous effect that the usual traveling state can be maintained as it is without shifting the traveling state of the electrically-driven vehicle to the push-walk traveling state.",
        "The electrically-driven vehicle is configured in another embodiment not to receive the instruction from the push-walk switch means when the vehicle speed exceeds the given value. Accordingly, even when the manipulation of the push-walk switch means is performed by the rider when the vehicle speed exceeds the given value, for example, during the usual traveling, the lowering of the speed of the vehicle is not generated. Thus, it is possible to obtain an advantageous effect that a more favorable traveling feeling can be maintained.",

        "Hereinafter, an electrically-driven vehicle according to one embodiment of the present invention is explained in conjunction with the drawings. FIG. 1 is a side view of the electrically-driven vehicle according to one embodiment of the present invention, wherein the electrically-driven vehicle 10 includes a handle shaft 12 which is rotatably mounted on a front portion of a vehicle body frame 11 with a handle 13 mounted on an upper portion of the handle shaft 12. A front fork 14 is mounted on a lower portion of the handle shaft 14 with a front wheel 16 mounted on a lower end of the front fork 14. A floor step 17 is mounted on a center portion of the vehicle body frame 11 with batteries 18, 18 (only symbol 18 indicative of the front-side battery being shown) arranged below the floor step 17. A swing-type power unit 22 is vertically swingably mounted on a lower portion of a seat post 21 which constitutes a rear portion of the vehicle body frame 11. A rear wheel 23 functions as a wheel which is mounted on a rear portion of the power unit 22 with a rear shock absorber 24 extending between an upper portion of the power unit 22 and the seat post 21 side. A battery control unit 25 functions as a voltage conversion part which is mounted on an intermediate portion of the seat post 21 with a tail lamp 26 arranged behind the battery control unit 25. A seat 27 is mounted on an upper end portion of the seat post 21.",
        "The vehicle body frame 11 includes a head pipe 31 which rotatably supports the handle shaft 12 on a front portion thereof.",
        "The handle 13 includes an arm 33 which is mounted on an upper end of the handle shaft 12, a handle support member 34 which extends upwardly from the arm 33, and a handle bar 35 which is mounted on an upper end of the handle support member 34. With the provision of the handle support member 34, it is possible to arrange the head pipe 31 at a low position. Thus, the vehicle body frame 11 can be miniaturized whereby the weight of the vehicle body frame 11 can be reduced.",
        "The battery 18 is of a type in which a plurality of columnar battery cells are wrapped by a resin-made shrink pack (a packaging material which wraps the battery cells by being shrunken with heat).",
        "The battery control unit 25 includes a charger which allows an electric current to flow into the battery 18 after rectifying a commercial power source to a direct current and by lowering the direct current to a given voltage, and a DC-DC converter which converts a battery voltage which is set to a high voltage for driving a motor into a low voltage for the electrical equipment such as the tail lamp.",
        "More specifically, the battery control unit 25 is integrally constituted of the charger and the DC-DC converter. Although the battery control unit 25 is explained as an integral type including the charger and the DC-DC converter in this embodiment hereinafter, it is needless to say that the charger and the DC-DC converter may be constituted separately. For example, the charger may be arranged close to the battery 18 and the DC-DC converter may be arranged close to the electrical equipment such as the tail lamp or the like.",
        "A head lamp 41 and a main switch 42 are mounted on a front portion of the vehicle body frame 11 with a front fender 43 which covers a position above the front wheel 16. An under cover 44 is provided that covers a position below the floor step 17 with a side stand 47 and a rear fender 48 which covers a position above the rear wheel 23. A license plate 51 is mounted on a lower portion of the tail lamp 26 with a helmet 52 which is accommodated below the seat 27.",
        "FIG. 2 is a side view showing the vehicle body frame of the electrically-driven vehicle according to this embodiment, wherein the vehicle body frame 11 includes the above-mentioned head pipe 31, a downward pipe 61 which extends straight and substantially downwardly from the head pipe 31 and a pair of left and right lower pipes 62, 62 which extend downwardly, rearwardly and upwardly from the down pipe 61. The above-mentioned L-shaped seat post 21 is mounted on the lower pipes 62, 62 with a seat frame 63 extending rearwardly from an upper end portion of the seat post 21. An intermediate frame 64 is provided which extends rearwardly from the intermediate portion of the seat post 21. Reinforcing members 66, 66, 67, 67, 68, 68, (only symbols 66, 67, 68 on the front side being indicated) are provided together with a power support member 71 which is mounted on a lower end portion of the seat post 21 for mounting the swing shaft of the power unit 22 (see FIG. 1).",
        "By forming the head pipe 31, the downward pipe 61, the lower pipes 62, 62 and the seat post 21 of the vehicle body frame 11 in a substantially U shape, it is possible to provide a simplified vehicle body frame 11 while having the functions necessary for the electrically-driven vehicle 10 wherein the handle 13 and the seat 27 are supported on end portions of the U shape shown in FIG. 1. At the same time, a bottom of the U shape supports the floor step 17 and accommodates the battery 18 therein.",
        "FIG. 3 is a plan view of the electrically-driven vehicle according to the present invention showing the arrangement in which the lower pipes 62, 62 of the vehicle body frame 11 are arranged below the floor step 17 having an approximately quadrangular shape. The batteries 18, 18 are arranged between these lower pipes 62, 62 in a state wherein the batteries 18, 18 are arranged in parallel in the left-and-side direction. A grip 77 is provided for adjusting an output of a motor (described later) with blinkers 78, 78 being mounted on the left and right sides of the tail lamp 26. The grip 77 may be constituted of a grip which is used in a usual electrically-operated motor cycle or the like in which the grip is rotated by grasping the grip per se or a lever-type grip (a thumb throttle) which is used in an ATV (All Terrine Vehicle) or the like.",

        "FIGS. 11 and 12 are provided for explaining, when the driver 103 performs the push-walk control and the throttle control during the push-walk control, a traveling speed flag and a push-walk speed flag which are used in the determination of conditions in these controls. FIG. 11 shows states to which the traveling speed flag (FRUN in the drawing) is moved or changed in response to the change of the rotational speed of the motor. A point at which the state of the flag is changed from the stop state to the low-speed rotation state at the time of acceleration is indicated by NESTPH in the drawing, while a point at which the state of the flag is changed from the low-speed rotation state to the stop state at the time of deceleration is indicated by NESTPL in the drawing. In the same manner, a point at which the state of the flag is changed from a low-speed rotational state to a high-speed rotational state at the time of acceleration is indicated by NECRSH in the drawing, while a point at which the state of the flag is changed from a high-speed rotation state to a low-speed rotation state at the time of deceleration is indicated by NECRSL in the drawing. Further, when the rotational speed of the motor<0, that is, when the rotation is inverted, the stop state is set in the traveling speed flag.",
        "FIG. 12 shows the transition of the state of the push-walk speed flag (FWLKV in the drawing) which determines whether the speed is a speed which allows the push-walk or not in the push-walk control. A point at which the push-walk speed flag is changed from the allowable vehicle speed to the inhibited vehicle speed at the time of acceleration is indicated by NEWLKH in the drawing and a point at which the push-walk speed flag is changed from the inhibited vehicle speed to the allowable vehicle speed at the time of deceleration is indicated by NEWLKL in the drawing. Further, when the rotational speed of the motor<0, that is, when the rotation is inverted, the allowable vehicle speed is set in the push-walk speed flag.",
        "Next, the push-walk control is explained in conjunction with a flowchart shown in FIG. 13. As a premise, the driver 103 always detects a value of the opening of the throttle and the pushing state of the push-walk switch from the throttle/push-walk input port 103d, and monitors the trouble state of the throttle sensor 77a and the push-walk switch 35a based on a leak current of the coupler 404b.",
        "First of all, in the start-up (step Sa1), the main switch 42 is started up and the push-walk control flag (FWLKC in the drawing) is set to the \u201cinhibited\u201d in the inside of the driver 103. Next, the driver 103 determines the trouble state of the push-walk switch 35a by making use of the leak current of the coupler 404b (step Sa2). When the push-walk switch 35a suffers from some trouble, the push-walk control flag is set to the \u201cinhibited\u201d (step Sa8). When the push-walk switch 35a is not in trouble, the pushing state of the push-walk switch 35a is determined (step Sa3). When the push-walk switch 35a is not pushed, the push-walk control flag is set to the \u201cinhibited\u201d (step Sa8). When the push-walk switch 35a is pushed, subsequently, the driver 103 receives the information on the opening of the throttle (THRA in FIG. 13) (step Sa4) and determines whether the value is not more than a given value (THRO) or not. Here, THRO which is a given value is an arbitrary voltage between a fully-closed voltage (for example, 0.8V) and a motor start-up voltage (for example, 0.9V) and the values equal to or below THRO exhibit the substantially fully-closed state. When the opening of the throttle exceeds the given value (THRO), the state of the push-walk control flag is maintained. When the opening of the throttle is substantially fully closed, subsequently, it is determined whether the push-walk speed flag (FWLKV in the drawing) is the allowable vehicle speed explained in conjunction with FIG. 12 or not (step Sa5). Since the push-walk control is driven provided that the push-walk switch 35a is continuously pushed, the driver 103 reads out and determines whether the push-walk switch 35a is pushed again after all of the above-mentioned conditions are satisfied or not (step Sa6). When the push-walk switch 35a is not pushed, the state of the push-walk control flag is maintained. When the push-walk switch 35a is pushed, the push-walk control flag (FWLKC in the drawing) is set to the \u201callowable\u201d (step Sa7). Thus, the push-walk control becomes possible.",
        "When the driver 103 assumes the state in which the push-walk control can be performed, the driver 103 inhibits the throttle control and starts the push-walk control. Thus, the motor 100 is driven at a given speed (for example, approximately 5 km/sec).",
        "On the other hand, in the push-walk control inhibition state, the driver 103 does not receive the push-walk control. That is, in the state wherein the push-walk switch 35a is not pushed down, when the opening of the throttle exceeds the given value or when the vehicle speed is not an allowable vehicle speed, that is, the usual traveling state is estimated, the throttle control flag continues the \u201cinhibited\u201d state so that the driver does not receive the push-walk control.",
        "Once the driver 103 assumes the push-walk allowable state, the determination of the opening of the throttle (THRA) and the determination of the push-walk speed flag (FWLKV) are not performed and the push-walk control is continued. However, when the push-walk switch 35a suffers from trouble or is removed, the push-walk control flag is set to the \u201cinhibited.\u201d Thus, the driver 103 stops the push-walk control.",
        "FIG. 14 is a flowchart including an explanation of the processing with respect to the control which does not sense the opening of the throttle and the vehicle speed when the driver 103 assumes the push-walk allowable state described in FIG. 13 and the determination whether the throttle control is performed or not in response to the sitting/non-sitting state of the seat. A symbol FINH in the drawing is a flag which indicates a throttle traveling control flag, wherein when the throttle traveling control flag is set to the \u201callowable,\u201d the throttle traveling is allowed and when the throttle traveling control flag indicates the \u201cinhibited,\u201d the throttle traveling is not performed. A symbol FSSW indicates a seat condition flag which shows the sitting state and the non-sitting state of the seat. The sitting/non-sitting states of the seat are also always detected from the seat switch input port 103f of the driver 103. Since other flags are equal to the flags which are used in FIG. 13, the explanation thereof is omitted.",
        "First of all, the main switch 42 is started up and the CPU of the driver 103 is reset (step Sb1). Thus, the throttle traveling control flag is set to the \u201cinhibited\u201d (step Sb2). Next, the state of the push-walk control flag (FWLKC) is determined (step Sb3). When the push-walk control flag is set to the \u201callowable,\u201d the throttle traveling control flag is set to the \u201cinhibited\u201d and the throttle control is longer performed (step Sb8). When the push-walk control flag is set to the \u201cinhibited,\u201d the processing advances to the determination processing of the traveling speed flag (FRUN) (step Sb4). The traveling speed flag is set to any one of the stop state, the low-speed rotation state and the high-speed rotation speed depending on the state transition explained in conjunction with FIG. 11, wherein when the traveling speed flag assumes the high-speed rotation state in the determination of the traveling speed flag (step Sb4), the throttle control flag is set to the \u201callowable\u201d (step Sb9). Thus, the throttle control can be performed. When the traveling speed flag assumes the low-speed rotation state, the preceding state is continued. When the traveling speed flag assumes the stop state, the processing advances to the next determination of the sitting condition of the seat (step Sb5). The sitting or the non-sitting state is set in the seat state flag (FSSW) and this state is determined. When the sitting is set in the seat condition flag (FSSW), the processing advances to the determination processing of the opening of the throttle (THRA) (step Sb6). In the determination processing of the opening of the throttle (step Sb6), when the opening of the throttle is not more than the given value (THRO), the \u201callowable\u201d is set in the throttle traveling control flag. Thus, the throttle control can be performed. When the opening of the throttle exceeds the given value (THRO), this state is continued. Next, when the seat condition flag is set to the non-sitting, the processing advances to the determination processing of the opening of the throttle (step Sb7). In the determination processing of the opening of the throttle (step Sb7), when the opening of the throttle is not more than the given value (THRO), the \u201cinhibited\u201d is set in the throttle traveling control flag, while when the opening of the throttle exceeds the given value (THRO), this state is continued. That is, to arrange the controls depending on the seat state, the throttle control can be performed only when the sitting is performed during the stop state and the throttle is substantially fully closed and when the rider leaves the seat during the stop, the throttle control is stopped.",
        "The driver 103 continuously monitors the states of the respective flags and performs the control based on the throttle traveling when the throttle control flag is set to the \u201callowable\u201d in other control parts. The driver 103, when the throttle control flag is set to the \u201cinhibited\u201d and the push-walk control flag is set to the \u201callowable,\u201d stops the reception of the control based on the throttle traveling, starts up the push-walk control, and drives the motor 100 at the given speed (for example, approximately 5 km/sec).",
        "The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims."
