    "description": [
        "In the semiconductor industry, critical steps in the production of integrated circuits are the selective formation and removal of films on an underlying substrate. The films are made from a variety of substances, and can be conductive or non-conductive. Conductive films are typically used for wiring or wiring connections. Non-conductive or dielectric films are used in several areas, for example, as interlevel dielectrics between layers of metallization, or as isolations between adjacent circuit elements.",
        "Typical processing steps involve: (1) depositing a film, (2) patterning areas of the film using lithography and etching, (3) depositing a film that fills the etched areas, and (4) planarizing the structure by etching or chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP). Films are formed on a substrate by a variety of well-known methods, for example, physical vapor deposition (PVD) by sputtering or evaporation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Films are removed by any of several well-known methods, including, chemical-mechanical polishing, dry etching such as reactive ion etching (RIE), wet etching, electrochemical etching, vapor etching, and spray etching.",
        "It is extremely important with removal of films to stop the process when the correct thickness has been removed. In other words, during the removal of films, it is important to know when the endpoint has been reached. In CMP, a film is selectively removed from a semiconductor wafer by rotating the wafer against a polishing pad (or rotating the pad against the wafer, or both) with a controlled amount of pressure in the presence of a chemically reactive slurry. Overpolishing of a film results in yield loss, and underpolishing requires costly rework. Accordingly, various methods have been employed to detect when the desired endpoint for removal has been reached, and the polishing should be stopped.",
        "The prior art methods for CMP endpoint detection suitable for all types of films involve the following types of measurement: (1) simple timing, (2) friction or motor current, (3) capacitive, (4) optical, (5) acoustical, (6) conductive and (7) chemical. In particular, chemical endpoint detection (e.g., Li et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,021,679) has been popular due to its ability to provide real-time and continuous analysis of the slurry during polishing, a direct signal endpoint as soon as the nitride layer is polished and a fast response time, typically less than one second, in addition to other benefits.",
        "It has been discovered that when chemically-mechanically polishing a substrate with a target film of oxide (SiO2) over a stopping film of nitride (Si3N4) with a slurry containing potassium hydroxide (KOH), a chemical reaction occurs when the oxide/nitride interface is reached, resulting in the production of ammonia (NH3). When polishing oxide, the following reaction occurs:\n\nSiO2+2KOH+H2O\u2192K2SiO3+2H2O",
        "When polishing nitride, the following reaction occurs:\n\nSi3N4+6KOH+3H2O\u21923K2SiO3+4NH3",
        "The ammonia produced is dissolved in the slurry and it exists primarily in the form of NH3 rather than NH4+. Thus, the presence of ammonia in the slurry indicates that the underlying nitride film has been reached and polished, and the endpoint for removal of the oxide film can be determined by monitoring the level of ammonia in the slurry. Once the endpoint is reached, the polishing is stopped.",
        "Typically, in order to detect and monitor ammonia in a gaseous form, slurry from a polishing apparatus is pumped through an ammonia extraction unit. The ammonia-containing gas stream can be analyzed and monitored for endpoint detection for removal of the target film. Gas phase chemical analysis, such as standard mass spectroscopy can be highly sensitive and have a fast response time, that would be desirable for endpoint detection. Unfortunately, with slurry sampling, there may be substantial interference from any residual ammonia created from the slurry composition itself, making accurate endpoint detection extremely difficult.",
        "Hence, what is needed is a composition and method for chemical-mechanical polishing of silica and silicon nitride for shallow trench isolation processes having improved end-point detection capability.",
        "In a first aspect, the present invention provides a method of manufacturing a composition for polishing silica and silicon nitride on a semiconductor substrate comprising: ion-exchanging carboxylic acid polymer to reduce ammonia; and combining by weight percent 0.01 to 5 of the ion-exchanged carboxylic acid polymer with 0.001 to 1 quaternary ammonium compound, 0.001 to 1 phthalic acid and salts thereof, 0.01 to 5 abrasive, and balance water.",

The invention advantageously utilizes an ion-exchange resin to reduce the ammonia content of the composition to reduce the interference from any slurry-originated ammonia contamination. In particular, the carboxylic acid polymer is ion-exchanged to reduce the ammonia content in the ceria-based slurry. In addition, the composition provides unexpected selectivity for removing silica relative to silicon nitride. The composition advantageously relies upon a chelating agent or a selectivity enhancer to selectively polish silica relative to silicon nitride for shallow trench isolation processes. In particular, the composition comprises a quaternary ammonium compound to selectively polish silica relative to silicon nitride, at the pH of the application.",

        "Preferred ion exchange resin particles are those prepared by functionalizing crosslinked, suspension-polymerized copolymer beads that are well known in the art as precursors for ion exchange resins. Gel copolymer beads bear their functional groups in an outer shell of uniform depth. Because the functionalization processes used to prepare these beads penetrate the copolymer at a uniform rate, the thickness of the functionalized layers tend to be uniform for all beads regardless of bead size, provided only that the smallest beads are not completely functionalized, i.e., not completely sulfonated. As a result, the diffusion paths are highly uniform, regardless of the uniformity of bead size.",

Decreasing the size of the abrasive to less than or equal to 80 nm, tends to improve the planarization of the polishing composition, but, it also tends to decrease the removal rate.",

Suitable inorganic oxides include, for example, silica (SiO2), alumina (Al2O3), zirconia (ZrO2), ceria (CeO2), manganese oxide (MnO2), or combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing oxides.

        "Accordingly, the present invention provides a composition and method having improved end-point detection signals for use in chemical end-point detection systems. In particular, the composition and method of the present invention is ammonia-reduced, thereby improving the accuracy of the chemical end-point detection system. The invention advantageously utilizes an ion-exchange resin to reduce the ammonia content of the composition to reduce the interference from any slurry-originated ammonia contamination. a composition useful for polishing silica and silicon nitride on a semiconductor wafer for shallow trench isolation processes. In particular, the carboxylic acid polymer is ion-exchanged to reduce the ammonia content in the ceria-based slurry. In addition, the composition advantageously comprises quaternary ammonium compounds for improved selectivity. In particular, the present invention provides an aqueous composition useful for polishing silica and silicon nitride on a semiconductor wafer comprising quaternary ammonium compound, phthalic acid and salts thereof, carboxylic acid polymer, abrasive and balance water. The composition exhibits particularly improved selectivity at a pH range of 4 to 7. Note, although the present embodiment concerns reduction of the ammonia content from the carboxylic acid polymer, the invention is not so limited. In other words, any constituent or component of the slurry, for example, the quaternary ammonium compound may be ion-exchanged to reduce any ammonia content, as necessary.",
        "All example solutions contained, by weight percent, 1.8 ceria, 0.18 polyacrylic acid, and 0.21 potassium hydrogen phthalate. In addition, the examples of the invention contained 0.12 weight percent, of a quaternary ammonium compound, in particular, tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide. The slurry was prepared by combining an abrasive package with a chemical package. The abrasive package was made by dissolving the polyacrylic acid concentrate in deionized water using a blade mixer and adding the ceria concentrate into the polyacrylic acid solution. Advantageously, the polyacrylic acid polymer was ion-exchanged with Amberlite IRN-77 ion exchange resin. The ion exchange resin was purchased in cylinders from Siemens Water Technologies, of Warrendale, Pa. The solution of carboxylic acid polymer is diluted to 5 percent to reduce the viscosity of the solution. The solution is pumped through the cylinders packed with the cationic ion exchange resin. The resin passes through the resin bed and comes out at a pH less than 3 and essentially free of all cationic species such as metal ions or ammonia. Then, the ceria-polyacrylic acid-water mixture was titrated using nitric acid. The mixture was then fed into a high shear Kady Mill. The chemical package was prepared by dissolving all remaining chemicals into deionized water, in proper amounts, mixing with a blade mixer and titrating to the final pH as desired using nitric acid. The final slurry is prepared by mixing the abrasive package with the chemical package and titrating to the desired pH.",
        "The patterned wafers were STI-MIT-864\u2122 masks from Praesagus, Inc. with HDP and LPCVD-SiN films. The MIT-864 mask design had 20 mm by 20 mm die consisting of 4 mm by 4 mm features. The features in the mask had 100 \u03bcm pitches with densities ranging from 10% to 100% each, and 50% densities with pitches ranging from 1 to 1000 \u03bcm. Here, 50% density is defined as the spaces in an array of repeated structures wherein the space width/(space width+line width)\u00d7100%=50%. For example, if the space width+line width=1000 microns, the 50% space has a width of 500 microns. IC1010\u2122 polishing pads were used for all tests.
