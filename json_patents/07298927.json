        "The present invention relates to an image processing apparatus, an image processing method, and a medium on which an image processing program is recorded. Particularly, the invention relates to an image processing apparatus, an image processing method, and a medium on which an image processing program is recorded, each for converting, to a naturally monochromatic image, an image which is read by an image inputting means such as a scanner from an original printed in two colors, a color other than black, or the like.

Further, the invention relates particularly to an image processing apparatus, an image processing method, and a medium on which an image processing program is recorded, each for performing the aligning between desired pages in the image data of a book inputted in an authoring system for preparing the contents of an electronic book by inputting the book on the image base.",
        "The progress in hardware and software has been activating the publication of electronic books as a new form of books in place of existing books on a paper medium. It has been realized to read cartoons and novels on a personal computer or a portable terminal.",
        "Although these electronic books can be prepared correspondingly to what is called multimedia data, such as an audio, an image, a dynamic image, and an animation, it is costly and laborious to fabricate an electronic book as the primary object. Thus, an electronic book is fabricated frequently by directly computerizing an existing book.",
        "There are following problems in the fabrication of an electronic book in accordance with a conventional art. A first problem exists in the case of converting, to a naturally monochromatic image, an image read by an image inputting means such as a scanner from a color-printed original or the like.",
        "The conversion from a color image to a monochromatic image is generally performed by extracting the brightness component from the color image. The following Formula (1) is a formula for extracting the brightness component (Y) from red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components.\n\nY=0.299R+0.587G+0.114B\u2003\u2003(1)",
        "This method is used also in the NTSC system which is a system for TV broadcasting, and is widely known. In the NTSC system, a color image is decomposed into a brightness signal and a color difference signal and then transmitted. Therefore, even a monochromatic television set can display a naturally monochromatic image on the television screen by receiving and reproducing the brightness signal alone.",
        "Formula (1) depends on the characteristics of human visual sensation, and a full-color image such as a photograph can be converted to a naturally monochromatic image by converting the brightness component to the monochromatic image.",
        "Meanwhile, the contents of an electronic book computerized directly from an existing book can be viewed on a color display without any problem because of the unlimited number of display colors. However, a portable terminal frequently uses a monochromatic liquid-crystal display because of the important factors of a low price and a low power consumption.",
        "Accordingly, a full-color image such as a photograph is usually converted to a monochromatic image. Using Formula (1) to convert it to a naturally monochromatic image, monochromatic contents can be produced from an existing book. Or, a color image can be displayed on a monochromatic display.",
        "However, in the case of a certain-existing book, especially a cartoon journal, the image is sometimes printed in two colors with red ink and black ink or in a color with ink of a color selected from the group consisting of red, green, blue, and the like other than black. In that case, a desirable image quality is hardly obtained by converting such an image using Formula (1).",
        "For example, in the case of an image printed in two colors with red ink and black ink, black is used for contours and shadows, and red is used for flesh color. When such an image is converted to a monochromatic image using Formula (1), the low mixing-ratio of red causes a problem that the red part becomes darker than the actual image.",
        "Further, an image is sometime printed in a single color other than black, such as red, green, and blue. When people view such an image, the color itself is not explicitly recognized, and the resulted impression is similar to that of the image printed in a color of black. However, when such an image is converted to a monochromatic image using Formula (1) in a similar manner to that for a photograph, the resulted image has a thin color and a low contrast. In particular, an image printed with green ink results in an image with a very thin color because of the large mixing-ratio of green in Formula (1).",
        "A second problem exists in the case of contracting a composite image such as a cartoon comprising a character, a line drawing, and a halftone dot, with good precision and without a moire.",
        "Printed matter, such as a cartoon and a novel, is originally printed in a very high resolution, and a scanner for reading it also has a high resolution of 400 dpi (dot per inch), 600 dpi, or higher. In contrast, the display resolution of a personal computer or a portable terminal is at most about 100 dpi. Thus, the contraction of an image is necessary to display an existing book on a personal computer or a portable terminal.",
        "In many cartoons, a halftone screen is used for the pseudo-expression of density and gradation. Since the halftone screen comprises fine mesh dots, lines, and patterns, the contraction thereof, as known, ordinarily results in a pattern of stripes or lattice which is called a moire. In the invention, a region to which the pseudo-expression of density or gradation is imparted is called a pseudo-density region.",
        "Conventional art of contraction is classified into two major methods: a method in which the whole region is homogeneously processed and a method in which the region is divided and each of the divided regions is contracted optimally. The method in which the whole region is homogeneously processed generally includes a thinning-out process to achieve the contraction by simply thinning out the pixels and an averaging technique to determine the pixel value of the contracted image by averaging the pixel values of the original image (Hitoshi Kiya, Resolution Conversion of Digital Image, CQ Publishing, The Interface, June 1998, p. 72).",
        "With regard to the region-dividing method, an image processing apparatus is described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication JP-A 4-365182 (1992). In accordance with the image processing apparatus described in JP-A 4-365182, a binary coded image is divided into two regions, i.e., drawing and painting regions. In the drawing region, contraction is performed so as to conserve the fine lines. In the painting region, a multi-value encoding process is performed on the base of the pixel density, and then a contraction/binary-encoding process is performed, thereby to contract even the character and the drawing sections with precision and without a moire.",
        "However, in the case of contracting an image such as a cartoon comprising a character, a line drawing and a halftone dot in combination, the thinning-out process causes a moire in the halftone section and unclearness and blurring in the character section and the line drawing section. In contrast, in the averaging technique, a moire is suppressed and the unclearness and blurring of a character and a fine line seldom occur, but the clearness of the whole is lost. To express the clearness, an edge enhancing process can be used after the contraction. However, the suppressed moire is also enhanced and appears. Although the moire can be completely eliminated by enlarging the area in which the pixels are averaged, characters and drawings blur on the other hand.",
        "As mentioned above, prior art homogeneous processing by the thinning-out process or the averaging process cannot achieve clear characters and drawings without a moire. Thus, it is necessary to divide the image into regions and process each region appropriately.",
        "The image processing apparatus described in JP-A 4-365182 performs region-dividing and performs a contraction process appropriate for each region. However, in a cartoon and the like, a line drawing may exist in halftone dots. Thus, a character and a line drawing cannot be separated by simple pattern matching. Further, a character exists in a balloon within the image. Thus, separation using a simple rectangle is difficult. In a method wherein an image is separated into two regions, i.e., a character/line drawing region and the other region, and wherein smoothing is performed in the region other than the character/line drawing region, an error frequently occurs in the extraction of the character/line drawing region. For example, a rather blurring part in a fine line and a complicated character is sometimes not extracted as a character/line drawing region because of the low edge component. The process of smoothing of this region causes further blurring in the character and the line drawing section.",
        "A third problem exists in the case of performing the correction to eliminate a ghost image which occurs during the reading of an original printed on both sides or an original being stacked.",
        "Since an existing book is ordinarily printed on both sides of a paper, there is a problem of what is called a ghost image, which is an image on the back side being seen through during the reading thereof with a scanner and the like or during the reading of a page being stacked with a scanner and the like.",
        "An image reader described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication JP-A 6-14185 (1994) is a prior art apparatus for correcting a ghost image. The image reader described in JP-A 6-14185 eliminates a ghost image part, which has a low density, by reducing the density through the density correction of the image signal, thereby preventing the copying of the seen-through image of the back side of an original or the next page of a stacked original.",
        "An image forming apparatus described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication JP-A 6-62216 (1994) is an apparatus for correcting a ghost image using front image data and back image data. The image forming apparatus described in JP-A 6-62216 performs an AND operation between the front image data and the back image data, performs the smoothing of the output by a histogram calculation, and then performs a threshold process. Then the apparatus combines it with image data which is the front image data subtracted by the data of the superposed part, thereby eliminating the ghost image without the loss of the low density part of the front image.",
        "Further, an image processing apparatus with ghost-image eliminating function described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication JP-A 8-340447 (1996) eliminates a ghost image by detecting a ghost image region in a video signal and the ghost image level within the ghost image region and by correcting the density of the ghost image region using the ghost image level.",
        "However, since the image reader described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication JP-A 6-14185 (1994) performs the density correction on the whole image, there occurs a problem that a halftone section whitens out and that a character becomes unclear.",
        "With regard to the image forming apparatus described in JP-A 6-62216, a ghost image cannot be completely eliminated in some cases, for example, in the case where a halftone section is seen through as a ghost image. Further, the positional relationship between the front image and the back image needs to be previously known, but the positions in which the images are read are not necessarily identical even if automatic paper feeding is used. Thus, a ghost image cannot be completely eliminated in such a case where the images are shifted from a predetermined position.",
        "In the image processing apparatus with ghost-image eliminating function described in JP-A 8-340447, a ghost image region is defined as a region in which non-character pixels are successive, a region in which non-painting pixels are successive, a region in which pixels having a density lower than or equal to a predetermined density are successive, and a region in which pixels having a saturation lower than or equal to a predetermined saturation are successive. Accordingly, the determination is carried out in a small area. Therefore, a ghost image cannot be separated from a halftone image on the front side, for example, when the ghost image is caused by a widely spreading black dark region of characters or images.",
        "A fourth problem exists in the case of performing the aligning between desired pages in the image data of a book inputted in an authoring system for preparing the contents of an electronic book by inputting the book on the image base.",
        "Although an electronic book can be prepared correspondingly to what is called multimedia data, such as an audio, an image, a dynamic image, and an animation, it adopts a text (character-code) based format. Meanwhile, books on a paper medium, what is called \u201cbooks\u201d are presently being published at a pace of 500,000 or more titles a year. The accumulated number is huge. However, the number of the computerized titles is very few and almost all exist only on a paper medium. Such a prior art electronic book has the following problems because of adopting the text-(character-code) based format.",
        "For the authoring of a book on a paper medium, the text data needs to be prepared by human work or with an OCR. Thus, the preparation of the contents requires a lot of time, which causes a difficulty in the timely supply of contents in a large amount. Further, it is difficult to prepare the contents of a book such as a cartoon and a photographic journal, in which a majority of the data is non-text. For this reason, present number of the electronic book contents is as small as a few hundred, and many of the contents are dictionaries. Accordingly, the share of electronic books is presently below 1% of that of paper books. In particular, the small number of the contents is a fatal problem, which is significantly preventing the spread of electronic books. In such a situation, to resolve the above-mentioned problems, it is possible to obtain electronic book contents by inputting them on the image base. This has the following advantage.",
        "Contents preparation can be carried out basically only by scanning an existing book on a paper medium, which permits to supply a large amount of the contents in a short term. It permits to supply the contents of a cartoon a photographic journal, and the like, which was impossible in a text-based electronic book. Inputting is easy even when a book, such as an old document, contains a character not in the present character code system, for example, an external character and a heteromorphic character. Overseas deployment (spreading) of a viewer and a total authoring system is easy because of the independence of a language (character code). By the advantage mentioned above, an electronic book on the image base resolves all problems in an electronic book on the text base. To obtain the electronic book contents by inputting it on the image base, it can be inputted by scanner inputting with an ADF (auto document feeder) and the like, and various processes such as document structuring are carried out on it. However, the following problems occur.",
        "In the case where an image is inclined or shifted during the scanner inputting, an user of the electronic book feels uncomfortableness because the inclination is emphasized more than in the case of a paper book by a reference line (for example, an edge section of a CRT and a liquid-crystal screen) existing in a viewer. Thus, the process of correcting this is necessary. Manual processing of this needs a lot of working time, which causes a substantial increase in the authoring time. In particular, inclination and shift in a main page results in a strong uncomfortableness during the viewing on a viewer. Further, the checking of all pages for the revision of the electronic book contents causes an increase in the authoring time, which prevents to supply a large amount of contents in a short term. Thus, an appropriate process is necessary.",

        "FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an image processing apparatus 1a in accordance with a first embodiment of the invention. The image processing apparatus 1a comprises an image inputting section 2, a color analyzing section 3, a mixing-ratio calculating section 4, an image converting section 5, and an image outputting section 6. The image inputting section 2 reads an original image, for example, an image of a cartoon journal, in a predetermined unit, such as a spread and a page, and inputs it to the color analyzing section 3. The color analyzing section 3 analyzes the color used in the input image. The mixing-ratio calculating section 4 determines the mixing-ratio r:g:b of the respective color components of red (R), green (G), and blue (B). The image converting section 5 mixes the color components of R, G and B based on the determined mixing-ratio, thereby converting the input image into a monochromatic image. The image outputting section 6 outputs the converted image.",
        "The image inputting section 2 is implemented by an image reading apparatus, such as a scanner, a copying machine, and a camera. It may also be implemented by an apparatus for reading an image from an medium, such as a CD-ROM (compact disk-read only memory), a hard disk, a floppy disk and a magneto-optical disk, which contains an image previously read from an original, as well as by a semiconductor memory.",
        "The image outputting section 6 is implemented by an image displaying apparatus, such as a CRT (cathode ray tube) and an LCD (liquid crystal display). It may also be an image printing apparatus such as a printer. Further, it may also be implemented by an apparatus for writing out an image on an medium, such as a CD-ROM, a hard disk, a floppy disk and a magneto-optical disk, as well as by a semiconductor memory.",
        "The color analyzing section 3, the mixing-ratio calculating section 4 and the image converting section 5 are implemented, for example, by a computer and a software.",
        "FIG. 2 is a flow chart showing the image processing method of the image processing apparatus 1a. The image inputting section 2 inputs an original image in a predetermined unit (S1). The color analyzing section 3 analyzes the color used in the input image (S2). The mixing-ratio calculating section 4 determines the mixing-ratio r:g:b of the respective color components of R, G and B (S3). The image converting section 5 mixes the color components of R, G and B according to the mixing-ratio, thereby converting the input image to a monochromatic image (S4). The image outputting section 6 outputs the converted image (S5).",
        "FIG. 3 is a flow chart for describing the color analyzing section 3. The color analyzing section 3 converts the input image in a predetermined unit into hue (H), saturation (S) and lightness (L) (S21). The conversion of the input image into H, S and L can be carried out by a well known method (description is omitted). Then, the representative hue and the dispersion are obtained from the distribution of H and S(S22). Then, the presence or absence of a black pixel is determined from the histogram of L (S23), thereby determining the color used in the image (S24).",
        "FIG. 4 is a graph for describing the step S22. FIG. 4(a) is a graph having a horizontal axis indicating hue (H) and a vertical axis indicating the sum of saturation (S). The sum of S is defined by the sum of the values of S of all the pixels having an identical value of H. It is shown as a histogram weighted by S in order to obtain the color used in the image. Selecting the H giving the maximum of the sum of S, let it be the representative hue H0. When the sum of S at H0 is less than or equal to a predetermined value, the input image is determined as an originally monochromatic image, and the representative hue H0 is determined as absent.",
        "Using the relation H\u00b12\u03c0=H, the sum of S is transformed so that the sum of S distributes in a range of H0\u00b12\u03c0, thereby obtaining the dispersion V. When the dispersion V is greater than or equal to a predetermined value, it is determined that a plurality of colors are used in the input image. Otherwise, it is determined that the representative hue H0 alone is used.",
        "FIG. 5 is a graph for describing the step S23. When a histogram of lightness (L) is prepared in 256 steps, black not being used decreases the low lightness pixels as shown in FIG. 5(a), and black being used increases the low lightness pixels as shown in FIG. 5(b). Accordingly, whether black is used or not can be determined depending on whether the distribution of the pixels in a low lightness range is within a predetermined range or not.",
        "FIG. 6 is a graph for describing the step S24. When the representative hue H0 is absent, the input image is determined as a monochromatic image (S241). When the dispersion V obtained in the step S22 is greater than or equal to a predetermined value, it is determined that a plurality of colors are used in the input image (S242). Otherwise, the input image is determine as a monochromatic image in a color other than black if a black pixel is absent, and the input image is determine as an image in black plus another one color if a black pixel is present (S243).",
        "Using the representative hue H0, the color used in the image is determined as follows. First, determine which of 0, \u03c0/3, 2\u03c0/3, \u03c0, 4\u03c0/3, 5\u03c0/3 and 2\u03c0 is the closest to H0. Here, H0 is assumed to be within the range of 0-2. It is respectively determined as red (R) for 0 and 2\u03c0, yellow (Y) for \u03c0/3, green (G) for 2\u03c0/3, cyan (C) for \u03c0, blue (B) for 4\u03c0/3 and magenta (M) for 5\u03c0/3.",
        "The mixing-ratio calculating section 4 is described below. The mixing-ratio calculating section 4 determines the mixing-ratio r:g:b of the R, G and B components based on the analysis result of the color analyzing section 3. That is, it changes the mixing-ratio correspondingly to the color used in the image.",
        "When the color analyzing section 3 determines as a monochromatic image, r=0, g=1 and b=0 are used, for example. In a monochromatic image, there is no difference in R, G and B components, and hence, any of the r, g and b may be unity. Further, all of them may be an identical value.",
        "When the color analyzing section 3 determines as plural colors, r=0.299, g=0.587 and b=0.114 are used similarly in an ordinary color/monochromatic conversion. Using such a mixing-ratio, a full-color image such as a photographic image can be converted to a naturally monochromatic image.",
        "When the color analyzing section 3 determines as a single color other than black, the mixing-ratio is assigned by the ratio of the color components of the complimentary color of the color used in the image which is obtained and inputted by the color analyzing section 3. Here, the complimentary color is the color which becomes white when mixed with that color. For example, when the color used in the input image is red (R), its complimentary color is cyan (C). Since the ratio of the R, G and B components of cyan is 0:1:1, required mixing-ratio becomes r=0, g=0.5 and b=0.5. By mixing the R, G and B in such a mixing-ratio the conversion to a monochromatic image is achieved with the highest contrast of the image.",
        "When the color analyzing section 3 determines as black plus one color other than black, the mixing-ratio is assigned by the ratio of the color components of the complimentary color of the color used in the image obtained by the color analyzing section 3, with adjustment by the ratio of the color components used in the image. For example, when the colors used in the input image are red (R) and black, the ratio of the color components of red (R) is 1:0:0, and the ratio of the R, G and B components of cyan (C) which is the complimentary color of red is 0:1:1. In order to set the red between black and white for the distinction between red and black, the ration of red is reduced to the half of the ratio of cyan, and added. Therefore, required mixing-ratio r:g:b becomes r=0.2, g=0.4 and b=0.4. Here, the ratio between the color used and its complimentary color is set to 1:2, however, the ratio may be changed based on the color used.",
        "By being previously provided with a mixing-ratio table containing the optimum mixing-ratio for each of the above-mentioned colors and color combinations, the mixing-ratio calculating section 4 may merely refer to the mixing-ratio table. This avoids the necessity of calculating every time, thereby speeding up the process.",
        "Further, in the case where the image conversion is performed image by image and that each of the images has a bias in color, the result of the image conversion sometimes differs, which causes uncomfortableness in turning over the leaf of the electronic book viewed in a portable terminal such as a viewer. Thus, a plurality of images may be converted as a whole. Specifically, the image inputting section 2 inputs a plurality of images, and the color analyzing section 3 analyzes the color from the result of the integration of the color used in each image from among the plurality of images. The mixing-ratio calculating section 4 calculates a mixing-ratio common to all the input images, and the image converting section 5 converts all the images in the same mixing-ratio. Accordingly, images can be converted to monochromatic images more stably.",
        "Finally, the image converting section 5 converts each pixel into a monochromatic image M0 based on the conversion formula\n\nM0=r R+g G+b B (where r+g+b=1),\n\nusing the mixing-ratio r:g:b of the respective R, G and B color components determined by the mixing-ratio calculating section 4.",

The image processing apparatus 1b comprises an image inputting section 2, a mixing-ratio calculating section 4, an image converting section 5, an image outputting section 6 and a color specifying section 8. The image inputting section 2, the mixing-ratio calculating section 4, the image converting section 5, and the image outputting section 6 are identical to those of the above-mentioned image processing apparatus 1a, and hence, the description is omitted.

The image outputting section 6 outputs the image (S5).",
        "The difference from FIG. 2 of the first embodiment is only the point that the step S2 is replaced by the step S6.

        "The color specifying section 8 is described below. The color specifying section 8 permits a user to select the kind of the image from the group consisting of monochromatic, plural colors, one color other than black, and black plus one color other than black. When one color other than black or black plus one color other than black is selected, the color other than black is further selected from the group consisting of red (R), yellow (Y), green (G), cyan (C), blue (B) and magenta (M). Accordingly, by a user specifying the determination of the color, the image can be determined more accurately to be converted to a monochromatic image.",

        "The image contracting section 25 is described below. The image contracting section 25 contracts the pseudo-density region by a smoothing process, contracts the character/line drawing region by contraction due to an averaging process and by a subsequent edge enhancing process, and contracts the region other than the pseudo-density region and the character/line drawing region by the averaging process alone. Accordingly, a moire is prevented in the pseudo-density region. In the character/line drawing region, unclearness and blurring are prevented by the averaging process, and the clearness is kept by the edge enhancing process. In region other than the pseudo-density region and the character/line drawing region, the performing of the averaging process alone prevents unnecessary blurring by a smoothing process and the increase in noise by unnecessary edge enhancement. In the case where a character/line drawing region and a pseudo-density region are in the near vicinity, the averaging process and the edge enhancing process occurs in the near vicinity, whereby the image quality extremely changes. Thus, the boundary pixels may be set as a region other than the pseudo-density region and the character/line drawing region, whereby the image quality changes smoothly.",

In the case where the scale is not a reciprocal number of a whole number, the lattices of the original image and the contracted image does not coincide. In that case, for example, a coordinate value may be rounded into a whole number, or a pixel may be averaged with a weight corresponding to the ratio of the areas common to the lattices.

For example, as shown in FIG. 26, the image dividing section 39 divides the image into regions 1-5. The region 1 is a surrounded region having a character, the region 2 is a base region, the region 3 is a black halftone region, the region 4 is a thin halftone region, and the region 5 is a thick halftone region. Assume that the regions 1-5 does not include a black pixel or an edge portion, such as a character. Further assume that a ghost image having the same brightness as the region 4 exists in the regions 1 and 2. The regions 3-5 using a halftone screen have a low average brightness, however, the regions 1 and 2 have a high average brightness because of the white background. Accordingly, by performing a brightness correction in the high average brightness regions 1 and 2 alone, the ghost image in the regions 1 and 2 can be eliminated with the halftone in the region 4 preserved even when the regions 1 and 2 have a ghost image having the same brightness as the region 4 . Accordingly, a black region in an image is excluded from the region to correct a ghost image because of the unremarkableness of a ghost image.",

As described above, by performing the ghost-image correction in high average brightness regions alone, even a halftone portion having the same brightness as a ghost image can be prevented from the whitening-out of the uniform region surrounded by lines. Further, since black regions and edge portions are excluded, the unclearness of a character and the whitening-out of a black portion are prevented.",

FIG. 27 is a graph for describing the method of calculating the pixel value t2. First, the histogram of the pixel values of a high brightness region is prepared, and pixel values tmin and tmax are defined. When all the pixels of the high brightness region exist in the right of tmax, set t2=tmax. When all the pixels of the high brightness region exist in the left of tmin, set t2=tmin. When the pixel having the minimum exists between tmin and tmax, let the value be the pixel value t2.

A majority of the pages are main-text pages each having a header region (shows a page number in the present example), a footer region (shows a chapter number in the example) and a contents region (main-text region) in a fixed position. The image processing apparatus 50 aligns the pages using such a feature.",
        "The processes by respective sections of the image processing apparatus 50 are described below. The image inputting section 51 reads a binary or multi-valued image from a scanner and the like, and saves it in an input image buffer 58. This image may be a monochromatic image or a color image. The orientation of the image input is roughly correct, and the input is carried out in the sequence of the pages from the first or the last. In the case of the reading by a scanner and the like, it is preferable that the input region of the scanner is larger than the size of a page, considering the case of the inclined input due to the error of an automatic feeder, if used. This situation is assumed in the following description. When a page is larger than the input region of the scanner, it can be inputted in divided pieces and reconstructed in the input image buffer 58.",
        "The page contour detecting section 52 is described below. Since the page is smaller than the input region of the scanner, the image inputted by the image inputting section 51 consists of an actual page region of the book and a background region behind it. The page contour detecting section 52 discriminates between the background region and the page region form the input image, thereby extracts the contour of the page region. Here, in the case where a book is used after being separated into pages, a page sometimes has the inclined or torn edge corresponding to the back portion. In that case, the contour is not an accurate rectangle, but is assumed to be approximated by a rectangle.",
        "The methods for detecting the contour of a page region include a method in which an edge portion is detected from the image thereby detecting the fact that each angle of the rectangle is 90 degree from the edge point, a method in which an ensemble of edge points having a large change in brightness is extracted thereby obtaining a straight line from the ensemble thereby extracting the contour and the like.",
        "An example of a technique of detecting the contour of a page region is described below with reference to FIGS. 30 and 31. FIG. 30 is a diagram for describing this technique. FIG. 31 is a flowchart for describing this technique. Since the contour of a page region is a rectangle, a method of detecting the four straight lines in the outermost location of the image is described herein.",
        "First, description is made for the case of detecting a contour line in the left side of the page region shown in FIG. 30(a) (S61, S62). A line to scan is selected firstly (S63). The top row is selected here because the scan is carried out horizontally. Since the scan is carried out from left to right, the left end is set to the initial value (i=0) (S64). Scanning the image sequentially, the brightness of each point is acquired from the input image buffer 58 (S56). Determination is carried out whether the point is an edge point or not (S66). The method of the determination is to calculate the first-order differential in the horizontal direction. An example of this is the method using a Sorbel filter. When the point is determined as an edge point, the coordinate of the point is stored (S69), the scanning of the line is terminated, and the next line is selected. Such a scan is carried out through all the lines to the bottom row (S69). When the point is determined not as an edge point, it is determined whether an edge of the image or not (S67). When it is determined as an edge of the image, it proceeds to S69. When it is determined not as an edge of the image, i=i+1 is set (S68), and it returns to S65. As a result, an ensemble of the coordinate of the edge points is obtained. A majority of these accumulate on a straight line. Thus, the straight line is calculated. This is typically carried out by the half transformation (S71). The process described above is carried out in each of the four directions (corresponding to D=0-3 in the flow of FIG. 31) of the input image (FIG. 30(b)) (S72), thereby obtaining four straight lines (S73), thereby detecting these straight lines as the contour of the page region (FIG. 30(c)) (S74).",
        "The page contents region extracting section 53 is described below with reference to FIGS. 32 and 33. The page contents region extracting section 53 extracts a page contents region from the image within the contour of the page region obtained by the page contour detecting section 52. FIG. 32 is a diagram for describing this technique. FIG. 33 is a flow chart for describing this technique.",
        "As shown in FIG. 32(a), scanning the image in the sequence of the lines (S61, S62), an edge point is extracted. This is by the same method as the page contour detecting section 52. This edge point may be an edge of a character, a section line in a figure or table, or an edge of a balloon of a cartoon. However, an edge point of a character region is to be obtained in the present example. In the case of a character string and the like, the obtained edge point ensemble does not exists on a straight line. Thus, obtaining the lines (straight lines) circumscribing such an edge ensemble (FIG. 32(b)), the straight lines are set as the boundary of the page contents region (FIG. 32(c)) herein.",
        "The method of obtaining the circumscribing line is described again with reference to FIG. 33. First, an edge point ensemble is obtained (S75). Selecting two points from the edge point ensemble, the equation of the straight line passing through the two points is obtained (S76). The equation of the straight line is\n\n(y2\u2212y1)x\u2212(x2\u2212x1)y\u2212(x1y2\u2212x2y1)=0\n\nwith the coordinate of the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).",
        "It is determined on which side of the straight line another edge point not selected exists (S77). The determining equation is\n\nF(x, y)=(y2\u2212y1)x+(x2\u2212x1)y\u2212x1y2+x2y1\n\nwhere the point (x, y) locates on the origin side when F(x, y)<0 and outside when F(x, y)>0.",
        "When all the points locate on the same side, the straight line is a circumscribing line. Otherwise, another two points are selected (S78-80). Repeating for all the combination, an circumscribing line can be obtained definitely.",

        "The page information processing section 57 is described below. The page information processing section 57 determines whether the input image of a book is a main-text page or the other page. The method of the determination is a method in which the size or the shape of the figure of the circumscribing lines extracted by the page contents region extracting section 53 is compared and it is determined as a main-text page when the size or the shape is within a predetermined range. An alternative method is a method in which consecutive pages are determined as the main-text pages during the consecutive pages having an almost constant size of the rectangle of the circumscribing lines continue. This method depends on the fact that the input is carried out in the sequence of the pages and that the main-text pages have an almost constant size of the rectangle of the circumscribing lines detected by the page contents region extracting section 53. Another alternative method is a method in which the first page of and the last page (sheet numbers) of the main-text pages are previously specified externally. This method also depends on the fact that the input is carried out in the sequence of the pages. Further, when determining as a main-text page, the page information processing section 57 stores the positional information of the page contents region in the rectangle of the circumscribing lines into a page positional information buffer 60, and uses it as a template for aligning the main-text images and, hence, the pages. When the page positional information buffer 60 already contains the positional information of the template indicating a main-text page used as a reference for the page alignment, it proceeds to the page position correcting section 55.",
        "The page position correcting section 55 is described below. Although the inclination of an input image is corrected, the position of the page contents region of the main-text page varies image by image because of mechanical deviation and the like during the reading. If the intact main-text pages are outputted as an electronic book without position correction, the positional variation occurs during the viewing of the contents of the main-text pages in a viewer and the like, which causes uncomfortableness. Thus, the page position correcting section 55 corrects, using a parallel displacement, the position of the images of the main-text pages the inclination of which is corrected, so as to coincide with the positional information of the template indicating a main-text page stored in the page positional information buffer 60. As a result, the image outputting section 56 can provide the image data in which the main-text pages are aligned. In other words, once the template is obtained from a page determined as a main-text page, the subsequent main-text pages are aligned with the reference to the template.",
        "The above-mentioned template includes all of the header region, the footer region and the contents region of a main-text page. However, each region may be separated as shown in FIG. 35(a), and stored into the page positional information buffer 60 in the form shown in FIG. 35(b). Such a separation simplifies character recognition, key word extraction, and the like, thereby simplifying the structuring of a document.",
        "In the above-mentioned description, all the processes are automated. However, the processes of the page contour detecting section 52, the page contents region extracting section 53, and the inclination correcting section 54 may be carried out manually.",
        "The images of a book is ordinarily inputted automatically and sequentially. Accordingly, whether the next input is a main-text page or the other is not known at the time of the input. Further, even in the case of a main-text page, the size of the page contents region differs, for example, in the last page of a chapter. Thus, even in the case where a page is determined as a main-text page, when the positional information of the page contents region of the newly input image differs from the positional information of the template in the page positional information buffer 60 (when the positional information is out of a predetermined range), an error is concluded, an error bit is written into an error buffer (not shown) page by page, and warning data is generated and maintained. Accordingly, a user can easily recognize the pages the error of which is to be corrected by a manual process, by watching the warning data from the error buffer through display means (not shown) after the completion of the automatic process of the whole book.",
