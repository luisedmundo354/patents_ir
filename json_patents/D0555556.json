        "The vehicle fender is styled independently of adjacent vehicle panels. To the extent that any feature lines are illustrated, they are intended to illustrate the crest and valley of the feature and are not necessarily sharp bends in the part. Shading is used to illustrate the curvature of the part and not color. Areas shown in or sounded by phantom lines are not claimed. The surface normally visible when the vehicle fender is attached to a vehicle is called the \u201cClass A\u201d surface is claimed. The surface not normally visible when the vehicle fender is attached to a vehicle is called the \u201cClass B\u201d surface and is not claimed. Any functional features of the vehicle fender are not claimed. The views are an orthographic projection."
