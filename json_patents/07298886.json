    "title": "Counting biological agents on biological growth plates",
    "abstract": "The invention is directed to counting techniques for counting biological agents on a biological growth plate or similar medium. In order to automate the counting of biological agents, a biological growth plate is inserted into a biological scanning unit. Upon insertion of the biological growth plate, the biological scanning unit generates an image of the plate. Then, the amount of biological agents that appear in the image, such as a number of bacteria colonies, can be counted or otherwise determined using image processing and analysis routines performed either by the scanning unit or an external computing device, such as a desktop computer, workstation or the like. A variety of counting rules are described herein that can be used to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate.",

        "The invention relates to biological scaning systems for analysis of biological growth plates and detection of bacteria or other biological agents in food samples, laboratory samples, and the like.",
        "Biological safety is a paramount concern in modem society. Testing for biological contamination in foods or other materials has become an important and often mandatory requirement for developers and distributors of food products. Biological testing is also used to identify bacteria or other agents in laboratory samples such as blood samples taken from medical patients, laboratory samples developed for experimental purposes, and other types of biological samples. Various techniques and devices can be utilized to improve biological testing and to streamline and standardize the biological testing process.",
        "A wide variety of biological growth plates have been developed. As one example, biological growth plates have been developed by 3M Company (hereafter \u201c3M\u201d) of St. Paul, Minn. In particular, biological growth plates are sold by 3M under the trade name PETRIFILM plates. Biological growth plates can be utilized to facilitate the rapid growth and detection of bacteria or other biological agents commonly associated with food contamination, including, for example, aerobic bacteria, E. coli, coliform, enterobacteriaceae, yeast, mold, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria, Campylobacter, and the like. The use of PETRIFILM plates, or other growth media, can simplify bacterial testing of food samples.",
        "Biological growth plates can be used to enumerate or identify the presence of bacteria so that corrective measures can be performed (in the case of food testing) or proper diagnosis can be made (in the case of medical use). In other applications, biological growth plates may be used to rapidly grow bacteria or other biological agents in laboratory samples, e.g., for experimental purposes.",
        "Biological scanning units refer to devices used to scan or count bacterial colonies, or the amount of a particular biological agent on a biological growth plate, or the like. For example, a food sample or laboratory sample can be placed on a biological growth plate, and then the plate can be inserted into an incubation chamber. After incubation, the biological growth plate can be placed into the biological scanning unit for automated detection and enumeration of bacterial growth. In this manner, biological scanning units automate the detection and enumeration of bacteria or other biological agents on a biological growth plate, and thereby improve the biological testing process by reducing human error.",
        "In general, the invention is directed to techniques for counting biological agents on a biological growth plate or similar medium. To count biological agents, a biological growth plate is inserted into a biological scanning unit. Upon insertion of the biological growth plate, the biological scanning unit generates an image of the plate. Then, the amount of biological agents that appear in the image, such as a number of bacteria colonies, can be counted or otherwise determined using image processing and analysis routines performed either within the biological scanning unit or by an external computing device, such as a desktop computer, workstation or the like. In accordance with the invention, a variety of counting rules are described that can be used to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate.",
        "In one embodiment, the invention provides a method comprising receiving one or more images of a biological growth medium, determining whether a background color value associated with the biological growth medium is within a range, and flagging the biological growth medium for additional review if the background color value is outside the range.",

A variety of counting rules are described in greater detail below that can be used to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate. The counting rules are typically stored as computer-executable software instructions, and are executed by a processor in a biological scanning system. Alternatively, the rules may be implemented in hardware such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), or various hardware components. The various rules described herein may be applied individually, or in any combination depending on the growth medium being scanned. In any case, by applying one or more of the rules described herein, the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate can be improved.",
        "FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an exemplary biological scanning system 10 capable of implementing the counting rules described herein. As shown in FIG. 1, biological scanning system 10 includes a scanning unit 12 having a drawer 14 that opens to receive a biological growth plate (not shown in FIG. 1). Drawer 14 moves the biological growth plate into scanning unit 12 for scanning and analysis. An imaging device and a processor reside within scanning unit 12. When a biological growth plate is inserted into scanning unit 12 via drawer 14, the imaging device generates one or more images of the growth plate. The images are then sent to the processor, which counts the number of biological agents on the growth medium via image analysis. In particular, the processor within scanning unit 12 invokes one or more counting rules, as described in greater detail below, that can be used to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate.",
        "Biological scanning system 10 also may include a display screen 16 disposed on scanning unit 12 to display the progress or results of analysis of the biological growth plate to a user. Alternatively or additionally, display screen 16 may present to a user an image of the growth plate scanned by scanning system 10. The displayed image may be optically magnified or digitally scaled upward. A mounting platform 18 defines an ejection slot 20 through which the growth plate can be ejected following image capture by biological scanning system 10. In other words, biological scanning system 10 may have a two-part design in which scanning unit 12 is mounted on mounting platform 18. The two-part design is depicted in FIG. 1 for purposes of example, and is not intended to be required by or limiting of the inventions described herein.",

The imaging device may take the form of a line scanner or an area scanner, which ordinarily operates in combination with an illumination system to provide front and/or back illumination of the biological growth plate. In addition, scanning unit 12 may house processing hardware, software and/or firmware that performs analysis of the scanned image, e.g., in order to determine the number or amount of biological agents on the growth plate. For example, upon presentation of the biological growth plate via drawer 14, the plate may be positioned adjacent an optical platen for scanning. Again, in accordance with the invention, various counting rules can be applied by a processor within scanning unit 12 in order to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate.",
        "When drawer 14 is opened following the scan of a growth plate, the growth plate may drop downward into the mounting platform 18 for ejection via ejection slot 20. To that end, mounting platform 18 may house a conveyor that ejects the growth plate from scanning unit 12 via ejection slot 20. In other words, after a biological growth plate is inserted into drawer 14, moved into scanning unit 12, and scanned, the biological growth plate drops downward into mounting platform 18, where a horizontal conveyor, such as a moving belt, ejects the medium via slot 20.",

Biological scanning system 20 comprises a scanning unit 21 coupled to an external computer 22 which performs imaging analysis of the images generated by scanning unit 21. In other words, whereas system 10 (FIG. 1) integrates a processor internally inside scanning unit 12, system 20 (FIG. 2) makes use of a processor external to scanning unit 21, e.g., in external computer 22. For example, external computer 22 may include a microprocessor that executes software for image analysis of biological growth plate 24. External computer 22 may comprise a personal computer (PC), desktop computer, laptop computer, handheld computer, workstation, or the like.

Scanning unit 21 also includes an ejection slot (not shown), through which growth plate 24 is ejected following imaging of growth plate 24. Scanning unit 21may also include other features, such as a display screen (not shown) to display the progress or results of analysis of the biological growth plate to a user.",

In addition, scanning unit 21 may house various illuminators for illuminating the front and back of biological growth plate 24 during imaging. The illuminators can illuminate biological growth plate 24 with one or more colors, and one or more images of growth plate 24 can be generated and then analyzed to determine bacteria counts on growth plate 24. In particular scanning unit 21 communicates the images to external computer 22, which includes a processor for performing image analysis.",
        "Growth plate 24 may include a growth area 27 where bacteria or other agents manifest on growth plate 24. Growth area 27 may be a flat surface or a recessed well. A determination of whether a given sample being tested in growth plate 24 is acceptable, in terms of bacterial colony counts, may depend on the number of bacterial colonies per unit area. Accordingly, images generated by scanning unit 21 can be used to quantify the amount of bacterial colonies per unit area on plate 24. The size of individual colonies may also be factored into the analysis, if desired. The surface of biological growth plate 24 in growth area 27 may contain one or more growth enhancing agents designed to facilitate the rapid growth of one or more types of bacteria or other biological agents. In some cases, biological growth plate 24 is incubated prior to insertion into scanning unit 21.",
        "Growth plate 24 may also include indicia 29, such as a bar code or other type of identification marking used to identify growth plate 24. RFID tags, two-dimensional optically detectable codes, or the like, may also be used as indicia. In any case, indicia 29 may identify the type of bacteria or biological agent being grown and tested on growth plate 24. Scanning unit 21 can be designed to draw growth plate 24 into scanning unit 21 to a first location and generate an image of indicia 29, and then draw growth plate 24 to a second location and generate an image of growth area 27. In this manner, images of indicia 29 and growth area 27 can be generated by biological scanning system 20. Alternatively, a single image may capture both indicia 29 and the growth area 27. In either case, the scanning of indicia 29 can facilitate identification of the type of plate being used so that one or more desirable counting rules can be applied in an automated fashion.",
        "By way of example, growth plate 24 may comprise a biological growth plate sold by 3M under the trade name PETRIFILM plates. Growth plate 24 can be utilized to facilitate the rapid growth and detection of bacteria or other biological agents commonly associated with food contamination, including, for example, aerobic bacteria, E. coli, coliform, enterobacteriaceae, yeast, mold, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria, Campylobacter, or the like. Growth plates are generally one type of growth medium commonly used for biological growth and bacterial detection and enumeration. The invention, however, may also be applied with a wide variety of other types of growth media.",
        "In order to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate, various aspects of the invention establish rules that can be applied during image processing. In other words, the rules described in greater detail below can form part of a counting algorithm executed in system 10 or system 20. The different rules may be used individually or in any combination, depending on the type of growth medium being scanned and the problems that may be encountered. For example, some rules may be relevant for particular types of growth plates as outlined below. The order in which rules are applied may also affect the result. In any event, application of one or more of the counting rules can improve a biological scanning system such as system 10 or system 20 by improving the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a growth medium such as a growth plate or the like.",
        "FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a biological scanning system 30, which may correspond to system 10 (FIG. 1) or system 20 (FIG. 2). Biological scanning system 30 includes an imaging device 32 that generates one or more images of a growth medium and provides the images to processor 34. Processor 34 is coupled to memory 36. Memory 36 stores various processor-executable software instructions that facilitate image analysis of the images generated by imaging device 32. In particular, memory 36 stores one or more counting rules 37 which are applied during image analysis to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate. Output device 38 receives the results determined by processor 34 and provides the results to a user.",

In any case, the images are analyzed by applying counting rules 37 in order to determine bacteria counts on the growth plate. The resolution of imaging device 32 may be approximately 155 pixels per centimeter. In that case, a one centimeter line in the image is 155 pixels long and each pixel is approximately 6.45 \u00d710EE-3 long.",
        "Reducing the cost of imaging device 32 is desirable. Although high cost optical elements, such as high-quality lenses can improve imaging, such elements can drive up the cost of system 30 to exorbitant levels. One or more of counting rules 37 may provide an alternative mechanism for achieving improvements in system 30. For example, one or more counting rules 37 may compensate for optical defects in imaging device 32. Accordingly, in some cases, counting rules 37 can reduce the costs of system 30 by allowing lower cost optical elements to be used in imaging device 32.",

        "FIG. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating a process of automated biological growth plate analysis. As shown in FIG. 4, processor 34 receives one or more images of a growth plate (41). Processor 34 invokes various software routines from memory 36 to count the biological agents on the growth plate (42). For example, bacterial colonies may be identified according to color differences, in which bacterial colonies manifest on the growth medium by changing color. The software executed by processor 34 can allow for identification of the biological growth area on the growth plate and automated counting of bacterial colonies based on color changes in the growth area where the colonies have grown during incubation.",
        "In accordance with the invention, processor 34 applies one or more rules to improve the accuracy of the count of biological agents on the growth medium (43). A variety of rules are described in the following description. The rules may be applied individually or various combinations of rules may be used, depending on the type of growth plate being analyzed. The rules may be individually invoked from memory 36 or may form sub-routines of a larger image analysis software program. The rules described below are labeled as rules 1, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4, 5 and 6. This notation, however, is provided to aid the discussion of the rules, and in no way implies an order of the application of the rules. The rules may be applied individually or various sets of the rules may be applied.

        "FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary growth plate 50 including a growth area 52 and indicia 54, e.g., for identifying plate 50 as a specific type of growth plate, sample dilution, sample type or origin. Similarly, FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary growth plate 60 including a growth area 62 and indicia 64. As illustrated, the background color or shading associated with growth area 52 of growth plate 50 is different than that of growth area 62 of growth plate 60. If the background color associated with growth area 52 of growth plate 50 does not fall within a defined color range, then problems may exist with respect to growth plate 50. In accordance with rule 1 described herein, the color of a growth plate can be identified and compared to a color range. If the color of the growth plate falls outside the range, the growth plate can be flagged for review by a technician.",
        "FIG. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating rule 1. As illustrated, processor 34 invokes software stored in memory 36 to identify the color value of a growth plate (71). In particular, processor 34 may quantify the color of the growth plate as one or more numeral values that defines the shade of the plate. The shade, for example, may be characterized by 3 numbers defining red, green and blue values, or hue, saturation and intensity values. If one or more of the color values of the growth plate are outside a rule 1 range (72), e.g., if the shade of the plate is not within a range of shades established as acceptable, then that growth plate is flagged for additional review (73). For example, flagged growth plates may require technician review in order to determine if the color of the growth plate indicates a problem. In this manner, rule 1 automates the identification of potentially faulty growth plates based on the color of the plate. The rule 1 color range is generally specific to the type of growth plate used, and generally establishes a range of colors that indicate that the growth plate is acceptable. Shade values can be used to define the color range and color values with one or more numerical values.",
        "FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary growth plate 80 including a growth area 82 and indicia 84. FIG. 8 also provides a legend which indicates that square-shaped areas are colonies that have been identified and circular-shaped areas are colonies with gas that have been identified. For some growth plates, colonies with gas indicate confirmed types of biological colonies that can be enumerated, whereas colonies without gas indicate a colony that may or may not be enumerated.",
        "One problem with growth plates is that one colony may split and generally manifest as two or more distinct marks on the growth plate. In that case, the two or more distinct marks generally indicate the same colony for purposes of bacterial counts. However, automated systems may count each marking as a separate colony. This problem often becomes more prevalent with colonies that include gas because the gas may generate from within, above or below the perimeter of the colony, which can affect the colony and cause it to split.",
        "In order to reduce this problem, rules 2A and 2B provide alternative techniques for identifying colonies that have likely split from a single colony that grew on the growth plate. In general, when a growth plate includes a limited number of colonies and two or more colonies are very close together, it may be desirable to count the two or more colonies that are very close together as a single colony because of a high probability that the two colonies split from a single colony that grew on the growth plate. The sets of colonies identified at 85A, 85B and 85C, for example, may be likely candidates for application of such a rule.",
        "FIG. 9 is a flow diagram illustrating rule 2A. Processor 34 invokes software stored in memory 36 to analyze one or more images of a biological growth plate count the number of biological agents on the plate. If the plate count, i.e., the initial number of agents identified on the plate is greater than a rule 2 threshold (no branch of 91), then no change is made to the plate count. However, if the plate count is less than the rule 2 threshold (yes branch of 91), then changes may occur. For example, the rule 2 threshold may be approximately 20 although this number could take any value for various implementations. In general, it is most desirable to invoke steps (92-94) when the number of initial counts is relatively small because incorrect counts have a more drastic affect on the percentage of counts when the number of total counts is relatively low.",
        "If the plate count is less than the rule 2 threshold (yes branch of 91), then processor 34 determines whether one colony is within a defined distance D2 of another colony (92). If so (yes branch of 92), processor attributes only one count to the two colonies within the defined distance D2 of each other (73). The distance D2 may be defined in terms of absolute distance or in terms of pixels in the images. For example, the distance D2 may be defined as a width of approximately 18 pixels from center to center of two pixels. If two colonies are within distance D2 of each other (93), e.g., from center to center, those two colonies are counted as one colony.",
        "In other words, if two colonies are very close to one another on a growth plate that has relatively few colonies, then those two colonies are counted as a single colony because of a high probability that the two colonies split from a single colony that grew on the growth plate. Processor 34 considers every colony on the growth plate and determines for each colony whether it has neighboring colonies within the distance D2 of the given colony. The process of rule 2A ends when there are no more colonies to consider (no branch of 94). Accordingly, if three or more colonies are within a distance D2 of one another, the three or more colonies will be counted as one colony.",
        "FIG. 10 is a flow diagram illustrating rule 2B, which is a slight variation to rule 2A. Rules 2A and 2B are generally alternatives of solving a similar problem, e.g., identifying when two or more colonies in an initial count should be counted as a single colony. In both cases, processor 34 generates a first count, and then reduces the first count to generate a second count upon identifying two or more colonies in the first count that should be counted as a single colony. The same rule 2 threshold X2 is used in FIG. 9 and 10, although different thresholds could also be used for the different rules.",
        "Again, processor 34 invokes software stored in memory 36 to analyze one or more images of a biological growth plate count the number of biological agents on the plate. If the plate count, i.e., the initial number of agents identified on the plate is greater than a rule 2 threshold (no branch of 101), then no change is made to the plate count. However, if the plate count is less than the rule 2 threshold (yes branch of 101), then changes may occur.",
        "In particular, if the plate count is less than the rule 2 threshold (yes branch of 101), then processor 34 determines whether two colonies overlap (102). For example, processor 34 may define an identification mark that surrounds an area associated with each colony, which is typically between approximately 0.2 and 0.3 centimeters in diameter, although the colony mark may be proportional to the size of the colony exhibited. If two identification marks of two different areas overlap (yes branch of 102), processor 34 attributes only one count to the two colonies that overlap (103). In other words, if two colonies are very close to one another on a growth plate that has relatively few colonies, then those two colonies are counted as a single colony because of a high probability that the two colonies split from a single colony that grew on the growth plate. Processor 34 considers every colony on the growth plate and determines for each colony whether it has neighboring colonies that overlap with the given colony. The process of rule 2B ends when there are no more colonies to consider (no branch of 104).",
        "FIG. 11 illustrates an exemplary growth plate 110 including a growth area 112 and indicia 114. FIG. 11 also provides a legend which indicates that circular-shaped areas are colonies, and relatively large irregular shapes are spreader colonies (also referred to as \u201cliquefier colonies\u201d). One problem with growth plates like that illustrated in FIG. 11 is that one or more colonies may manifest from a spreader colony. In that case, the colonies that are relatively close to a spreader colony may actually be part of the spreader colony and not a separate and distinct colony. However, automated systems may count each marking as a separate colony, including the spreader colony and various colonies that manifest from the spreader colony.",
        "In order to reduce this problem, rules 3A and 3B provide alternative techniques for identifying colonies that have likely split from a spreader colony. Rules 3A and 3B are very similar to rules 2A and 2B identified above, but are specific to cases where spreader colonies have been identified. In general, when a growth plate includes a limited number of colonies and one or more colonies are very close to a relatively large spreader colony, it may be desirable to include the two or more colonies that are very close to the spreader colony as part of the spreader colony. The spreader colonies identified at 115A and 115B, for example, may be likely candidates for application of such a rule. The same rule 3 threshold X3 is used in FIGS. 12 and 13, although different thresholds could also be used for the different rules.",
        "FIG. 12 is a flow diagram illustrating rule 3A. Processor 34 invokes software stored in memory 36 to analyze one or more images of a biological growth plate count the number of biological agents on the plate. If the plate count, i.e., the initial number of agents identified on the plate is greater than a rule 3 threshold (no branch of 121), then no change is made to the plate count. However, if the plate count is less than the rule 3 threshold (yes branch of 121), then changes may occur. For example, the rule 3 threshold may be approximately 150 although this number could take any value for various implementations. In general, it is most desirable to invoke steps (122-123) when the number of initial counts is below a threshold because incorrect counts have a more drastic affect on the percentage of counts when the number of total counts is relatively low.",
        "If the plate count is less than the rule 3 threshold (yes branch of 121), then processor 34 determines whether a spreader colony was identified (122). For example, spreader colonies may be identified based on shape, size and/or color. In particular spreader colonies generally have a relatively large irregular shape and may manifest at a slightly different color than other colonies. If one or more spreader colonies are identified, then processor 34 excludes from the count, any colonies within a defined distance (D3) of the spreader colony. The distance D3 may be defined in terms of absolute distance or in terms of pixels in the images. For example, the distance D3 may be approximately 0.065 cm, which may correspond to the width of approximately 10 pixels in system 30. In any case, any colonies within distance D3 of a spreader colony are excluded from the count, and attributed to being part of the spreader colony.",
        "FIG. 13 is a flow diagram illustrating rule 3B, which is a slight variation to rule 3A. Rules 3A and 3B are generally alternatives of solving a similar problem, e.g., identifying when colonies in an initial count should be counted as part of a spreader colony. In both cases, processor 34 generates a first count, and then reduces the first count to generate a second count upon identifying a spreader colony and another colony that should be counted as part of the spreader colony.",
        "Processor 34 invokes software stored in memory 36 to analyze one or more images of a biological growth plate count the number of biological agents on the plate. If the plate count, i.e., the initial number of agents identified on the plate is greater than a rule 3 threshold (no branch of 131), then no change is made to the plate count. However, if the plate count is less than the rule 3 threshold (yes branch of 131), then changes may occur.",
        "In particular, if the plate count is less than the rule 3 threshold (yes branch of 131), then processor 34 determines whether a spreader colony was identified (132). Again, spreader colonies may be identified based on shape, size and/or color. If one or more spreader colonies are identified, then processor 34 excludes from the count, any colonies that overlap with spreader colony (133). For example, processor 34 may define a relatively large identification mark that surrounds an area associated with the spreader colony. In addition, processor 34 may define identification marks that surround areas associated with other colonies. If the identification mark associated with the spreader colony overlaps that of any other colonies, the other colonies that overlap the spreader colony are excluded from the count. In that case, the other colonies that overlap the spreader colony are attributed to being part of the spreader colony.",
        "FIG. 14 illustrates an exemplary growth plate 140 including a growth area 142 and indicia 144. FIG. 14 also provides a legend which indicates that square-shaped areas are colonies that have been identified and circular-shaped areas are colonies with gas that have been identified. Different shading distinguishes \u201cred\u201d colonies from \u201cblue colonies.\u201d Of course, the colors red and blue are exemplary, and similar growth plates may use any other colors. In general, a first color may correspond to one type of colony and the second color may correspond to another type of colony. In some cases, one color may identify a general colony and another may identify a more specific colony. For example, red may identify a coliform colony and blue may identify an E. coli colony, which is a specific type of coliform. Colonies with gas may indicate confirmed types of biological colonies that can be enumerated, whereas colonies without gas may indicate a colony that may or may not be enumerated with certainty, e.g., in accordance with governmental regulations.",
        "One problem with growth plate analysis is that imaging artifacts can cause irregularities in images of growth plates. If relatively low cost optical elements, such as low cost lenses, are used in the imaging device, this problem can be significant. On the other hand, however, it is desirable to control the costs in a biological scanning system and high cost optical elements can add considerable costs. Accordingly, a better option to using higher cost optical elements may be the development of image analysis rules and techniques that can identify and overcome problems associated with lower cost optical elements.",
        "Growth plate 140 includes a relatively few number of colonies in a center portion 147 of growth area 142. However, a larger number of colonies are present in a perimeter portion 149 of growth area 142. Statistically, it is expected that the colonies will be evenly distributed. Accordingly, when a much larger number of colonies are present in a perimeter portion 149 of growth area 142 than interior portion, a problem may be identified. This phenomenon may be attributed to optical defects in imaging device 32. In the following description, the interior portion 147 generally refers to approximately the interior most 75 percent of growth area 142, whereas perimeter portion 149 refers to approximately the perimeter most 25 percent of the growth area 142. In other embodiments, however, the perimeter portion and interior portion may be allocated differently.",

In addition, processor 34 identifies a number of blue counts (Binterior) in the interior portion of a biological growth plate (152). If the number red counts (Rinterior) in the interior portion of a biological growth plate is less than a rule 4 threshold (X4) (yes branch of 153), then processor does not count any small area red colonies within a defined distance D4 of the outer edge of the growth plate, e.g., perimeter portion 149 (154). Similarly, if the number blue counts (Binterior) in the interior portion of a biological growth plate is less that a rule 4 threshold (X4) (yes branch of 155), then processor does not count any small area blue colonies within a defined distance D4 of the outer edge of the growth plate, e.g., perimeter portion 149 (154).",
        "Small area colonies generally refer to colonies having a defined area or diameter less than a defined threshold. The small area colonies may be defined relative to an absolute measured size or may be defined in terms of pixels in the images.

Statistically, it is expected that the colonies will be evenly distributed. If a much higher percentage of red colonies manifest in one area and a much higher percentage of blue colonies manifest in another area, a problem may be identified. In that case, the blue colonies may be counted as red colonies, e.g., where the red colonies identify a more general presence of bacterial growth and the blue colonies identify a more specific type of bacterial growth. With uneven distribution, the presence of blue colonies are less reliable as indicators of the specific type of bacterial growth, but would typically still indicate more general bacterial presence. Accordingly, in automated bacterial colony counting it may be desirable to count the blue colonies as red colonies if uneven distribution is identified, particularly in plates having relatively low bacterial counts.",
