Form V is defined by the X-ray powder diffraction pattern illustrated in FIG. 5, which is obtained by a properly aligned diffractometer equipped with a diffracted beam curved graphite monochromator using copper K\u03b1 X-radiation. Form V may be produced by adding water gradually to amorphous compound of formula (I) at around 70\u00b0 C. with rapid stirring over 2 h.

        "The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the various anhydrous crystalline forms and solvates of the present invention is determined using conventional techniques and equipment known to those skilled in the art of physical characterization. The diffraction patterns of FIGS. 1-6 were obtained with a Philips X-Pert MPD diffractometer system equipped with a diffracted beam curved graphite monochromator using copper K\u03b1 X-radiation and an automatic divergent slit. A xenon proportional counter was used as the detector. The powder sample used to generate the X-ray powder diffraction data was prepared by conventional back filled sample preparation techniques using a 16 mm diameter holder about 2 mm thick.",
        "A powder sample of each of Forms I, II, IV, V, VI and the ethanolate were used to produce the X-ray powder diffraction patterns of FIGS. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 3, respectively. The X-ray diffraction patterns for each of the various forms and solvates are unique to the particular form. Each crystalline anhydrous form or solvate exhibits a diffraction pattern with a unique set of diffraction peaks which can be expressed in 2 theta angles (\u00b0), d-spacings (\u212b) and/or relative peak intensities.",
        "2 Theta diffraction angles and corresponding d-spacing values account for positions of various peaks in the X-ray powder diffraction pattern. D-spacing values are calculated with observed 2 theta angles and copper K\u03b11 wavelength using the Bragg equation. Slight variations in observed 2 theta angles and d-spacings are expected based on the specific diffractometer employed and the analyst's sample preparation technique. More variation is expected for the relative peak intensities. Identification of the exact crystal form of a compound should be based primarily on observed 2 theta angles or d-spacings with lesser importance placed on relative peak intensities. In a mixture of crystal forms, the strongest diffraction peak for each form may overlap with the diffraction peak of another form. In a mixture of crystal forms, identification may be based on the presence of a lesser intensity peak that does not overlap with the other crystal forms. To identify 5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(\u03b2-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole Form I, the single most characteristic 2 theta angle peak occurs at 2.57 degrees, or 34.35 \u212b d-spacing. To identify 5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(\u03b2-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole ethanolate, the single most characteristic 2 theta angle peak occurs at 6.63 degrees, or 13.33 \u212b d-spacing. To identify 5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(\u03b2-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole Form IV, the single most characteristic 2 theta angle peak occurs at 11.78 degrees, or 7.51 \u212b d-spacing.",
        "It may be desirable to rely upon multiple 2 theta angles or multiple d-spacings for the identification of each of the various anhydrous crystalline forms and/or solvates of the present invention. Each of the various anhydrous crystalline forms and/or solvates of 5,6-Dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(\u03b2-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole can also be identified by the presence of multiple characteristic 2 theta angle peaks including two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten of the 2 theta angles which are reasonably characteristic of the particular crystalline form. Typically, Form I can be identified by the presence of X-ray diffraction peaks occurring at at least five of the following positions, expressed in 2 theta angles: 7.90, 10.39, 14.63, 15.79, 20.75, 21.99, 22.77, 24.14, 24.71, and 25.97 degrees. Typically, Form II can be identified by the presence of X-ray diffraction peaks occurring at at least five of the following positions, expressed in 2 theta angles: 7.91, 17.33, 18.23, 19.60, 21.88, 23.24, 23.92, 25.27, 27.70, and 29.21 degrees. The ethanolate can be identified by the presence of X-ray diffraction peaks occurring at at least five of the following positions, expressed in 2 theta angles: 9.07, 10.38, 15.95, 17.72. 20.75, 21.37, 22.96, 23.93, 25.40, and 29.05 degrees. Form IV can be identified by the presence of X-ray diffraction peaks occurring at at least five of the following positions, expressed in 2 theta angles: 9.29, 16.04, 18.67. 22.06, 22.68, 23.34, 24.40, 29.64, 30.92, and 31.62 degrees. Form V can be identified by the presence of X-ray diffraction peaks occurring at at least five of the following positions, expressed in 2 theta angles: 13.30, 18.13, 18.78, 20.41, 21.75, 23.02, 26.87, 28.34, 28.55, and 30.22 degrees.",
        "Some margin of error is present in each of the 2 theta angle assignments and d-spacings reported above. The error in determining d-spacings decreases with increasing diffraction scan angle or decreasing d-spacing. The margin of error in the foregoing 2 theta angles for Forms I, IV, V, and the ethanolate is approximately \u00b10.05 degrees for each of the foregoing peak assignments. The margin of error in the 2 theta angles for Form II is approximately \u00b10.09 for each of the foregoing peak assignments. The margin of error in d-spacing values for Forms I, IV, V, and the ethanolate is approximately \u00b10.05 Angstroms. The margin of error in d-spacing values for Form II is approximately \u00b10.09 Angstroms.",
        "Since some margin of error is possible in the assignment of 2 theta angles and d-spacings, the preferred method of comparing X-ray powder diffraction patterns in order to identify a particular crystalline form is to overlay the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the unknown form over the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of a known form. For example, one skilled in the art can overlay an X-ray powder diffraction pattern of an unidentified crystalline form of 5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(\u03b2-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole, obtained using the methods described herein, over FIG. 1 and readily determine whether the X-ray diffraction pattern of the unidentified form is substantially the same as the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of Form I. If the X-ray powder diffraction pattern is substantially the same as FIG. 1, the previously unknown crystalline form can be readily and accurately identified as Form I. The same technique can be used to determine if the unidentified crystalline form is any of Forms II, IV, V, or the ethanolate by overlaying the X-ray powder diffraction pattern over FIG. 2, 4, 5, or 3, respectively.",
        "Although 2 theta angles or d-spacings are the primary method of identifying a particular crystalline form, it may be desirable to also compare relative peak intensities. As noted above, relative peak intensities may vary depending upon the specific diffractometer employed and the analyst's sample preparation technique. The peak intensities are reported as intensities relative to the peak intensity of the strongest peak. The intensity units on the X-ray diffraction plot are counts/sec. The absolute counts=counts/time\u00d7count time=counts/sec\u00d710 sec. Considering 2 theta angles, d-spacing (\u212b) and relative peak intensity (I) of the fifteen most intense peaks, obtained by the method of Example 18 below, Form I 5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(\u03b2-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole exhibits the following X-ray diffraction pattern characteristics:",

While mixing continuously, sodium chloride, citric acid, sodium citrate, and sodium benzoate are added and dissovled. If necessary, the pH is adjusted to between 5.0 and 6.0, by adding sufficient citric acid or sodium citrate as necessary. Microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (Avicel RC 591) are added while mixing and mixing is continued until a uniform, smooth dispersion is formed. Polysorbate 80 is added while mixing. In a separate vessel, methylparaben is dissolved in propylene glycol and sodium carboxy methyl cellulose (0.25 g) is dispersed, and this liquid is added to the bulk dispersion while mixing. The active ingredient is gradually dispersed in the bulk liquid while mixing continuously, to produce a uniform dispersion. Flavorant and Colorant are added and the volume is adjusted to 100 ml by addition of purified water. The suspension is then homogenized by passing through a pump and a colloid mill.",
