        "This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/637,060 filed on Dec. 17, 2004.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to well logging. In particular, the present invention is an apparatus and method for imaging of subsurface formations using electrical methods.",
        "2. Background of the Art",
        "Birdwell (U.S. Pat. No. 3,365,658) teaches the use of a focused electrode for determination of the resistivity of subsurface formations. A survey current is emitted from a central survey electrode into adjacent earth formations. This survey current is focused into a relatively narrow beam of current outwardly from the borehole by use of a focusing current emitted from nearby focusing electrodes located adjacent the survey electrode and on either side thereof. Ajam et al (U.S. Pat. No. 4,122,387) discloses an apparatus wherein simultaneous logs may be made at different lateral distances through a formation from a borehole by guard electrode systems located on a sonde which is lowered into the borehole by a logging cable. A single oscillator controls the frequency of two formation currents flowing through the formation at the desired different lateral depths from the borehole. The armor of the logging cable acts as the current return for one of the guard electrode systems, and a cable electrode in a cable electrode assembly immediately above the logging sonde acts as the current return for the second guard electrode system. Two embodiments are also disclosed for measuring reference voltages between electrodes in the cable electrode assembly and the guard electrode systems.",
        "Techniques for investigating the earth formation with arrays of measuring electrodes have been proposed. See, for example, the U.S. Pat. No. 2,930,969 to Baker, Canadian Pat. No. 685,727 to Mann et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,468,623 to Gianzero, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,502,686 to Dory et al. The Baker patent proposed a plurality of electrodes, each of which was formed of buttons which are electrically joined by flexible wires with buttons and wires embedded in the surface of a collapsible tube. The Mann patent proposes an array of small electrode buttons either mounted on a tool or a pad and each of which introduces in sequence a separately measurable survey current for an electrical investigation of the earth formation. The electrode buttons are placed in a horizontal plane with circumferential spacings between electrodes and a device for sequentially exciting and measuring a survey current from the electrodes is described.",
        "The Gianzero patent discloses tool mounted pads, each with a plurality of small measure electrodes from which individually measurable survey currents are injected toward the wall of the borehole. The measure electrodes are arranged in an array in which the measure electrodes are so placed at intervals along at least a circumferential direction (about the borehole axis) as to inject survey currents into the borehole wall segments which overlap with each other to a predetermined extent as the tool is moved along the borehole. The measure electrodes are made small to enable a detailed electrical investigation over a circumferentially contiguous segment of the borehole so as to obtain indications of the stratigraphy of the formation near the borehole wall as well as fractures and their orientations. In one technique, a spatially closed loop array of measure electrodes is provided around a central electrode with the array used to detect the spatial pattern of electrical energy injected by the central electrode. In another embodiment, a linear array of measure electrodes is provided to inject a flow of current into the formation over a circumferentially effectively contiguous segment of the borehole. Discrete portions of the flow of current are separably measurable so as to obtain a plurality of survey signals representative of the current density from the array and from which a detailed electrical picture of a circumferentially continuous segment of the borehole wall can be derived as the tool is moved along the borehole. In another form of an array of measure electrodes, they are arranged in a closed loop, such as a circle, to enable direct measurements of orientations of resistivity of anomalies",
        "The Dory patent discloses the use of an acoustic sensor in combination with pad mounted electrodes, the use of the acoustic sensors making it possible to fill in the gaps in the image obtained by using pad mounted electrodes due to the fact that in large diameter boreholes, the pads will necessarily not provide a complete coverage of the borehole.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 6,714,014 to Evans et al., the contents of which are fully incorporated herein by reference, discloses a device suitable for resistivity imaging with water based mud (WBM) and oil based mud (OBM). The device disclosed in the Evans '014 patent is basically a wireline logging device. U.S. Pat. No. 6,600,321 to Evans discloses a modification of the Evans '374 application that is adapted for use in measurement while drilling (MWD) applications. Both of the Evans' patents have pad mounted electrodes that are in contact with the earth formation.",
        "The devices described above are galvanic devices in which current is injected into the formation. With the exception of the Evans patents, they only work when the borehole is filled with a conducting fluid. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/657,870 of Ritter et al., filed on Sep. 9, 2003 and the contents of which are fully incorporated herein by reference, teaches the use of galvanic, induction and propagation resistivity devices for borehole imaging in MWD applications. The resistivity sensor may be mounted on a pad, rib, or a stabilizer. Specifically disclosed therein are a shielded dipole antenna and a quadrupole antenna. In addition, the use of ground penetrating radar with an operating frequency of 500 MHz to 1 GHz is disclosed. One embodiment of the Ritter device involves an arrangement for maintaining the antenna at a specified offset from the borehole wall using, for example, hard facing.",
        "The prior art identified above does not address the issue of borehole rugosity and its effect on induction measurements. Being primarily high resolution imaging applications, the problem of \u201cseeing\u201d into the earth formation is generally not addressed. In addition, usually the effect of mud resistivity on the measurements is not addressed. It would be desirable to have a method and apparatus that estimates resistivities of earth formations away from the borehole. Such a method should take into account irregularities in the borehole wall, as well as the effect of mud resistivity. The present invention satisfies this need.",
        "One embodiment of the present invention is a method of and apparatus for determining a conductivity of an earth formation. First measurements of the conductivity are made using at least one transmitter antenna and at least one receiver antenna substantially concentric with the transmitter antenna. The at least one transmitter antenna and the at least one receiver antenna are disposed on a tool in a borehole in the earth formation. Additional measurements indicative of distances from the tool to a wall of the borehole are obtained. The first measurements are inverted using a model defined at least in part by the second measurements. In one embodiment of the invention, the first measurements are induction measurements. The second measurements may be caliper measurements obtained using an acoustic caliper or a mechanical caliper.",
        "The model includes a resistivity of mud in the borehole. The mud resistivity used in the inversion may be based on actual downhole measurements or they may be temperature corrected values of surface measurements. In one embodiment of the invention, the spatial geometry of the model is not updated during the inversion. The e.m.f. difference between initial and background models \u03b4e can be approximately described in the form of a linear system of algebraic equations. Using the linearized model, perturbations are calculated and added to the background model to give an updated background model. This is done iteratively until convergence is obtained.",

        "Before discussing specific methods and hardware for induction resistivity imaging in oil based mud, the principles on which such methods and hardware should be based are discussed. The analysis herein includes the effect of borehole rugosity, something that has hitherto been not addressed.",
        "FIG. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a drilling system 10 with a drillstring 20 carrying a drilling assembly 90 (also referred to as the bottom hole assembly, or \u201cBHA\u201d) conveyed in a \u201cwellbore\u201d or \u201cborehole\u201d 26 for drilling the wellbore. The drilling system 10 includes a conventional derrick 11 erected on a floor 12 which supports a rotary table 14 that is rotated by a prime mover such as an electric motor (not shown) at a desired rotational speed. The drillstring 20 includes a tubing such as a drill pipe 22 or a coiled-tubing extending downward from the surface into the borehole 26. The drillstring 20 is pushed into the wellbore 26 when a drill pipe 22 is used as the tubing. For coiled-tubing applications, a tubing injector, such as an injector (not shown), however, is used to move the tubing from a source thereof, such as a reel (not shown), into the wellbore 26. The drill bit 50 attached to the end of the drillstring breaks up the geological formations when it is rotated to drill the borehole 26. If a drill pipe 22 is used, the drillstring 20 is coupled to a drawworks 30 via a Kelly joint 21, swivel, 28 and line 29 through a pulley 23. During drilling operations, the drawworks 30 is operated to control the weight on bit, which is an important parameter that affects the rate of penetration. The operation of the drawworks is well known in the art and is thus not described in detail herein.",
        "During drilling operations, a suitable drilling fluid 31 from a mud pit (source) 32 is circulated under pressure through a channel in the drillstring 20 by a mud pump 34. The drilling fluid passes from the mud pump 34 into the drillstring 20 via a desurger, fluid line 38 and Kelly joint 21. The drilling fluid 31 is discharged at the borehole bottom 51 through an opening in the drill bit 50. The drilling fluid 31 circulates uphole through the annular space 27 between the drillstring 20 and the borehole 26 and returns to the mud pit 32 via a return line 35. The drilling fluid acts to lubricate the drill bit 50 and to carry borehole cutting or chips away from the drill bit 50. A sensor S1 preferably placed in the line 38 provides information about the fluid flow rate. A surface torque sensor S2 and a sensor S3 associated with the drillstring 20 respectively provide information about the torque and rotational speed of the drillstring.

        "In one embodiment of the invention, the drill bit 50 is rotated by only rotating the drill pipe 22. In another embodiment of the invention, a downhole motor 55 (mud motor) is disposed in the drilling assembly 90 to rotate the drill bit 50 and the drill pipe 22 is rotated usually to supplement the rotational power, if required, and to effect changes in the drilling direction.",
        "In the embodiment of FIG. 1, the mud motor 55 is coupled to the drill bit 50 via a drive shaft (not shown) disposed in a bearing assembly 57. The mud motor rotates the drill bit 50 when the drilling fluid 31 passes through the mud motor 55 under pressure. The bearing assembly 57 supports the radial and axial forces of the drill bit. A stabilizer 58 coupled to the bearing assembly 57 acts as a centralizer for the lowermost portion of the mud motor assembly.",
        "The communication sub 72, a power unit 78 and an MWD tool 79 are all connected in tandem with the drillstring 20. Flex subs, for example, are used in connecting the MWD tool 79 in the drilling assembly 90. Such subs and tools form the bottom hole drilling assembly 90 between the drillstring 20 and the drill bit 50. The drilling assembly 90 makes various measurements including the pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance measurements while the borehole 26 is being drilled. The communication sub 72 obtains the signals and measurements and transfers the signals, using two-way telemetry, for example, to be processed on the surface. Alternatively, the signals can be processed using a downhole processor in the drilling assembly 90.",
        "The surface control unit or processor 40 also receives signals from other downhole sensors and devices and signals from sensors S1-S3 and other sensors used in the system 10 and processes such signals according to programmed instructions provided to the surface control unit 40. The surface control unit 40 displays desired drilling parameters and other information on a display/monitor 42 utilized by an operator to control the drilling operations. The surface control unit 40 typically includes a computer or a microprocessor-based processing system, memory for storing programs or models and data, a recorder for recording data, and other peripherals. The control unit 40 is typically adapted to activate alarms 44 when certain unsafe or undesirable operating conditions occur.",
        "Turning now to FIG. 2, one configuration of a resistivity sensor for MWD applications is shown. Shown is a section of a drill collar 101 with a recessed portion 103. The drill collar forms part of the bottomhole assembly (BHA) discussed above for drilling a wellbore. For the purposes of this document, the BHA may also be referred to a downhole assembly. Within the recessed portion, there is a transmitter antenna 109 and two receiver antennas 105, 107 (the far receiver or receiver R2, and the near receiver or receiver R1) that are substantially concentric with the transmitter antenna. It is to be noted that the term \u201cconcentric\u201d has two dictionary definitions. One is \u201chaving a common center\u201d, and the other is \u201chaving a common axis.\u201d The term concentric as used herein is intended to cover both meanings of the term. As can be seen, the axis of the transmitter antenna and the receiver antenna is substantially orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the tool (and the borehole in which it is conveyed). Based on simulation results (not shown) it has been found that having the transmitter antenna with an axis parallel to the borehole (and tool) axis does not give adequate resolution.",
        "Operation of an induction logging tool such as that disclosed in FIG. 2 is discussed next in the context of an exemplary borehole filled with oil-base mud. Borehole walls are irregular. Resistivities behind the borehole walls need be determined as a function of both the azimuthal angle and depth. An array for determination of resistivities should be mounted above a sidewall pad. The generic schematic representation of a medium and a pad is shown in FIG. 3.",
        "Shown in FIG. 3 is a borehole 157 having mud therein and a wall 151. As can be seen, the wall is irregular due to rugosity. A metal portion of an antenna on a resistivity measuring tool is denoted by 155 and an insulating portion by 153.",

        "Let us consider an integral over the conductivity perturbation domain from (24) and (25) as a superposition of secondary source fields. We determine an integrand similarly to expression (24) and (25). The integrand is described in the multiplicative form. The anomalous part of the horizontal magnetic field component of a current loop can be represented as a superposition of responses from corresponding horizontal and vertical electric dipoles. In this case, the responses are Green's functions and these define moments of secondary sources \u03b4k2(\u03be\u2032)Exz and \u03b4k2(\u03be\u2032)Exy. The cofactors (Exz, Exy) ca be defined as follows",

        "In FIG. 9b are shown synthetic logs 307, 309, 311 for the same arrays, but the array centers are located along the y axis. The arrays can move along the z axis. In this case, a useful signal is about 2-3 times less that than in previous case and it does not exceed 150 mV.",

At four iterations, the results had converged to very close to the true resistivity (compare with the resistivity valuews in FIG. 7). The iterative procedure is discussed below.",
        "Next, a three-dimensional model based on the two-dimensional model is considrered. In the 3-D model, at y=0, both 2D and 3D distributions are the same. The 3D resistivity distribution is shown in FIG. 11. Shown in FIG. 12 are the average 1D resistivity distribution obtained trough measurements by the differential array of the first type shown in FIG. 2. In FIG. 13a are shown synthetic logs for three arrays\u2014the central array (203 and 207) (dz=2r0=0.05 m) and two symmetrical arrays (203 and 209; 207 and 209) (dz=\u00b1r0=\u00b10.025 m). A measured signal ranges from \u2212350 to 250 mV. At this we can see on the log the large number of extrema that arise at points where the system crosses layer boundaries. In FIG. 13b are shown logs for arrays with loop centers are located along the y axis as the array moves along the z axis. In this case a signal becomes essentially less than that in FIG. 13a and it ranges from \u221250 to 40 mV. The number of extrema decreases also (especially for the log obtained by the central array). Solution of the inverse problem results in reconstruction of the 3D distribution nearly without distortions. This is shown in FIGS. 14a and 14b.",
        "Shown in FIG. 14a are inversion results for y\u22660.05 m after one iteration 401 and after four iterarations 403. FIG. 14b shows the inversion results for y\u22670.05 m after one iteration 405 and after four iterations 405. The results are in good agreement with the model in FIG. 11.",
        "A brief explanation of the iterative procedure follows. Referring to FIG. 15, as noted above, an initial model 451 is the starting point for the inversion. Using the Jacobian matrix A discussed above 453, perturbations to the conductivity model are obtained 455 using eq. (26). Specifically, the difference between the measurements and the model output are inverted using the Jacobian matrix. This perturbation is added 457 to the initial model and, after optional smoothing, a new model is obtained. A check for convergence between the output of the new model and the measurements is made 459 and if a convergence condition is met, the inversion stops 461. If the convergence condition is not satisfied, the linearization is then repeated 453 with the new Jacobian matrix. The convergence condition may be a specified number of iterations or may be the norm of the perturbation becoming less than a threshold value.",
        "An important aspect of the inversion procedure is the definition of the initial model. The initial model comprises two parts: a spatial configuration of the borehole wall and a background conductivity model that includes the borehole and the earth formation. In one embodiment of the invention, caliper measurements are made with an acoustic or a mechanical caliper. An acoustic caliper is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,737,277 to Priest having the same assignee as the present invention and the contents of which are fully incorporated herein by reference. Mechanical calipers are well known in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 6,560,889 to Lechen having the same assignee as the present application teaches and claims the use of magnetoresistive sensors to determine the position of caliper arms.",
        "The caliper measurements defines the spatial geometry of the model. The spatial geometry of the model is not updated during the inversion The borehole mud resistivity is used as an input parameter in the model. The mud resistivity can be determined by taking a mud sample at the surface. Alternatively, the resistivity of the mud may be made using a suitable device downhole. U.S. Pat. No. 6,801,039 to Fabris et al. having the same assignee as the present invention and the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference teaches the use of defocused measurements for the determination of mud resistivity. If surface measurements of mud resistivity are made, then Corrections for downhole factors such as temperature can be made to the measured mud resistivity by using formulas known in the art.",
        "With the geometry of the borehole wall a fixed quantity, the integrals in eqn. 25(a) needed to determine the Jacobian matrix of eqn. (26) can be determined. In the three-layer model of FIG. 5, the only resistivities that are changed are those in the formation\u2014the borehole fluid having known properties. As noted above, using a plurality of current loops of the type shown in FIG. 6, logs can be obtained at different positions on the measurement pad. The combined set of measurements from the plurality of loops may be inverted data corresponding to a 3-D resistivity model such as that shown in FIG. 11. As noted above, either 2-D or data may be inverted.",
        "The invention has been described above with reference to a device that is conveyed on a drilling tubular into the borehole, and measurements are made during drilling The processing of the data may be done downhole using a downhole processor at a suitable location. It is also possible to store at least a part of the data downhole in a suitable memory device, in a compressed form if necessary. Upon subsequent retrieval of the memory device during tripping of the drillstring, the data may then be retrieved from the memory device and processed uphole. Due to the inductive nature of the method and apparatus, the invention can be used with both oil based muds (OBM) and with water based muds (WBM). The invention may also be practiced as a wireline implementation using measurements made by a suitable logging tool.",
        "The processing of the data may be done by a downhole processor to give corrected measurements substantially in real time. Alternatively, the measurements could be recorded downhole, retrieved when the drillstring is tripped, and processed using a surface processor. Implicit in the control and processing of the data is the use of a computer program on a suitable machine readable medium that enables the processor to perform the control and processing. The machine readable medium may include ROMs, EPROMs, EEPROMs, Flash Memories and Optical disks.",
