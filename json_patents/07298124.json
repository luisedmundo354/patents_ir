        "The present invention relates, in general, to electronics, and more particularly, to methods of forming semiconductor devices and structure.",
        "In the past, the semiconductor industry utilized various methods and structures to form pulse width modulated (PWM) power supply controllers. One important characteristic of the PWM controllers was the efficiency. Many PWM power supply controllers changed operating modes based on the amount of current required by the load. In some controllers, a continuous conduction mode was used when the current required by the load was large and a burst mode was used when the current required by the load was low. However, the burst mode often resulted in a large ripple voltage in the output voltage. While operating in the burst mode, the operating frequency often resulted in the PWM controller producing audible noise. Additionally, the PWM controllers needed complicated logic to switch the PWM controller between the two operating modes.",
        "Accordingly, it is desirable to have a PWM controller that has high efficiency during light load conditions, that reduces the ripple voltage in light load conditions, that can reduce the audible noise, and that reduces the amount of control logic.",

        "FIG. 1 schematically illustrates an embodiment of a portion of a power supply control system 10 that includes a power supply controller 25. Power supply controller 25 assists in providing system 10 with a high efficiency during light load conditions.

Such PWM controllers and transistor drivers are well known to those skilled in the art.",
        "Oscillator 50 is formed to provide a variable frequency clock signal (CLK) on an output 62 that is used as a timing reference for PWM controller 32. Oscillator 50 is also formed to provide a variable frequency ramp signal (Ramp) that is used as a reference voltage by PWM controller 32. Oscillator 50 includes a variable frequency oscillator (VFO) 51 that is formed to generate both the variable frequency ramp (Ramp) signal and a variable frequency oscillator signal that is used to form the variable frequency clock (CLK) signal. Oscillator 50 also includes a buffer 59 that isolates VFO 51 from controller 32 and also buffers the Ramp signal to provide sufficient drive for controller 32. A pulse shaper 61 of oscillator 50 receives the variable frequency oscillator signal generated by VFO 51, sharpens the edges of the variable frequency oscillator signal, and adjusts the duty cycle to form the CLK signal. In one embodiment, shaper 61 adjusts the duty cycle to approximately 50-50. Preferably, shaper 61 does not alter the frequency so that the CLK signal has the same variable frequency as the variable frequency oscillator signal. In some embodiments, either or both of shaper 61 and buffer 59 may be omitted. VFO 51 includes hysteresis comparator 56, a variable current source 52, a timing capacitor 53, a discharge current source 58, and a discharge switch or transistor 57. The value of the current generated by variable current source 52 is controlled by the value of a frequency control signal that is applied to a current control input of source 52. Oscillator 50 also includes a frequency control circuit 65 that is formed to generate the frequency control signal on a frequency control output 74. As will be seen further hereinafter, increasing the value of the frequency control signal increases the frequency of the Ramp signal and the frequency of the variable frequency oscillator signal of VFO 51, thus, the frequency of the CLK signal and the corresponding operating frequency of PWM controller 32. The frequency of VFO 51, the Ramp signal, and the CLK signal is represented by:\n\nF51=(K*V74)+Fmin",
        "where\n\n    \n    \n        F51\u2014is the oscillation frequency of VFO 51,\n        K\u2014is the scaling actor of VFO 51,\n        V74\u2014is the value of the variable frequency control signal on output 74, and\n        Fmin\u2014is the minimum frequency of VFO 51.\n\nTypically, Fmin is selected to be a frequency that is greater than the audible frequency range. For the example embodiment of VFO 51 illustrated in FIG. 1, the minimum frequency can be set by configuring source 52 to have a minimum current that results in the desired frequency. Circuit 65 includes a frequency increase current source 66, a frequency increase switch or transistor 67, a frequency decrease current source 71, a frequency decrease switch 72, a frequency capacitor 68, a transient switch or transistor 70, and a frequency control node 69 that is connected to output 74.",
        "For normal load conditions, system 10 operates in a continuous conduction mode (CCM). For light load conditions, the current required by the load connected between terminal 13 and return 12 (not shown) decreases. Controller 25 responsively reduces the width of the drive pulse for transistor 22. In some cases, the load current decreases sufficiently so that a discharge current 78 through inductor 14 reaches a value that is substantially zero. This type of operation is often referred to as a discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). The discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) typically is identified as a cycle of the CLK signal in which discharge current 78 through inductor 14 reaches a value that is substantially zero. The DCM operation of a particular CLK cycle begins approximately after current 78 through inductor 14 reaches the substantially zero value. DCM operation can occur for one cycle or for multiple cycles of the CLK signal based on current 78 becoming substantially zero for that particular cycle. As will be seen further hereinafter, the zero crossing of current 78 is detected by detector 43. Discharge current 78 is the current through inductor 14. The current through transistor 23 may be different than just current 78. Thus, controller 25 is formed to be compatible with either CCM or DCM operation and continues to enable transistors 22 and 23 in the same manner during both CCM and DCM operation.",
        "The operation of controller 25 during the first portion of the CLK cycle is the same in for either CCM or DCM operation. This first portion of the CLK cycle is the time that the PWM drive signal on output 37 of controller 32 is asserted. During this first portion of the CLK cycle, oscillator 50 generates the variable frequency clock signal (CLK) which sets latch 34 and facilitates controller 32 asserting the PWM drive signal on output 82 to enable transistor 22. Enabling transistor 22 supplies a charging current 77 to inductor 14, capacitor 16, and any load (not shown) connected between terminal 13 and return 12. Charging current 77 is the current through inductor 14. Asserting the CLK signal also resets latch 44 and prevents circuit 65 from decreasing the value of the frequency control signal on output 74 of circuit 65 while the PWM drive signal on output 37 of controller 32 is asserted. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, an edge detector circuit or edge detector 76 detects that the CLK signal is asserted and generates a pulse that resets latch 44. Asserting the PWM drive signal on output 37 also enables transistor 67 to conduct current from current source 66 to capacitor 68 thereby charging capacitor 68 and increasing the value of the frequency control signal applied to current source 52. Increasing the frequency control signal increases the amount of current supplied by source 52. Increasing the current supplied by source 52 increases the current supplied to charge capacitor 53 thereby charging capacitor 53 faster and increasing the operating frequency of oscillator 50. As the value of the voltage on capacitor 53 increases past the value of the second reference voltage applied to comparator 56, an output of comparator 56 goes high thereby enabling transistor 57 to begin discharging capacitor 53 through current source 58. Typically, the value of the discharge current supplied by source 58 is greater than the value of the current supplied by source 52. When source 58 has discharged capacitor 53 to a value approximately equal to or less than the value of the second reference voltage, the output of comparator 56 goes low thereby disabling transistor 57 which allows source 52 to again charge capacitor 53. Comparator 56 typically has a hysteresis input in order to prevent false triggering of comparator 56. As can be seen, VFO 51 functions as a relaxation oscillator. The example embodiment of VFO 51 and frequency control circuit 65 that are illustrated in FIG. 1 are example implementations of VFO 51 and circuit 65 but other implementations may be possible.",
        "Error amplifier 28 receives the feedback signal through a connection between a feedback input 84 of controller 25 and node 20. In some embodiments, amplifier 28 may include a frequency compensation network 29. Amplifier 28 generates an error signal that is received by comparator 33. Comparator 33 also receives the Ramp signal from oscillator 50. When the value of the ramp signal is approximately equal to or greater than the value of the error signal, comparator 33 resets latch 34. The reset of latch 34 is received by logic 36 which responsively negates the PWM drive signal on output 82 and disable transistor 22. Negating the PWM drive signal on output 37 of controller 32 also disables transistor 67 and decouples current source 66 from capacitor 68 thereby terminating the charging of capacitor 68. Logic 36 also responsively generates a PWM drive signal on output 83 to enable transistor 23 to steer current 78 through transistor 23. As is well known to those skilled in the art, transistor 23 has a body diode that may conduct some current when transistor 23 is not enabled, thus, enabling transistor 23 steers the current through transistor 23 to be controlled by transistor 23.",
        "If the current required by the load (not shown) connected between terminal 13 and return 12 remains large enough to prevent current 78 from becoming substantially zero, the second portion of the CLK cycle proceeds with CCM operation. In CCM operation of the second portion of the CLK cycle, controller 32 keeps transistor 23 enabled for the second portion of the CLK cycle and the corresponding cycle of controller 32 until oscillator 50 generates another cycle of the CLK signal and another corresponding PWM drive signal cycle. Unless current 78 reaches substantially zero, the operation continues in CCM operation as described previously.",
        "As long as CCM operation continues, the value of the frequency control signal is increased by each PWM drive signal on output 37 until oscillator 50 reaches the maximum frequency of oscillator 50. Typically, the maximum frequency is selected to be the desired operating frequency in the continuous conduction mode. After the maximum frequency is reached during CCM operation, the operating frequency of oscillator 50 remains substantially constant. Thus, during CCM operation the frequency gradually increases until reaching the maximum frequency. For the example embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the maximum frequency (Fmax) of oscillator 50 is represented by:\n\nFmax=(V31*K)+Fmin",
        "where\n\n    \n    \n        V31\u2014is the value of the voltage on output 31 of regulator 27, and\n        K\u2014is the scaling actor of VFO 51.",
        "If the current required by the load decreases sufficiently, DCM operation will begin. A CLK cycle for DCM operation begins similarly to CCM operation with the same operation during the first portion of the CLK cycle. Oscillator 50 asserts the CLK signal to initiate a CLK cycle and a corresponding PWM drive signal cycle. Controller 32 responsively asserts the PWM drive signal on output 37 which resets latch 44 and enables transistor 22 to form current 77. Subsequently, comparator 33 resets latch 34 to terminate the PWM drive signal on output 37 of controller 32 and generate a PWM drive signal on output 38 to enable transistor 23.",
        "Negating the PWM drive signal on output 37 of controller 32 also disables transistor 67 and decouples current source 66 from capacitor 68 thereby terminating the charging of capacitor 68. The amount of charge stored on capacitor 68 during the first portion of the CLK cycle that output 37 is asserted is represented by:\n\nQup=Ton*I66",
        "where\n\n    \n    \n        Qup\u2014the charge stored on capacitor 68,\n        Ton\u2014the time that output 37 is asserted, and\n        I66\u2014the current of source 66.\n\nDuring DCM operation, time Ton is proportional to the square root of charging current 77, thus, the charge added to capacitor 68 and the increase in the frequency of oscillator 50 is representative of the current through inductor 14. As a result, the frequency of oscillator 50 will change gradually with current 77. After the PWM drive signal on output 37 is negated, the value of the voltage stored on capacitor 68 and the corresponding frequency control signal remain substantially constant because source 52 has a high input impedance. Consequently, the operating frequency of VFO 51 remains substantially constant after transistor 67 is disabled. As is well known to those skilled in the art, there may be some change in the frequency due to leakage current, however, the change is usually small and the value remains substantially constant. Typically changes of up to ten percent (10%) are regarded by those skilled in the art as substantially constant.",
        "Approximately when current 78 becomes substantially zero, DCM operation begins. Zero crossing detector 43 is connected to node 21 to detect discharge current 78 through inductor 14 reaching a value that is substantially zero. When the value of current 78 becomes substantially equal to zero, the output of zero crossing detector 43 is asserted. As is well known to those skilled in the art, there may be minor offsets and variances that cause the output of detector 43 to be asserted slightly before or slightly after current 78 reaches a value of zero, however, the variance is usually small. Typically variances or errors of up to ten percent (10%) of the total cycle or period of the current through inductor 14 (the cycle of current 77 plus current 78) are regarded by those skilled in the art as substantially zero. Such zero crossing detectors are well known to those skilled in the art. Control logic 36 receives the asserted output of detector 43 and responsively disables transistor 23. The asserted output of detector 43 also sets latch 44 forcing the Q output high. Pulse generator 45 generates a pulse in response to the Q output going high. The high output of generator 45 enables transistor 72 thereby coupling source 71 to begin discharging capacitor 68 and decreasing the value of the frequency control signal applied to current source 52. Oscillator 50 receives the frequency control signal and responsively decreases the operating frequency.",
        "When the asserted period of the output of generator 45 expires, the output is negated which disables transistor 72 and terminates the discharging of capacitor 68. Thus, asserting the zero crossing signal (ZC) removes a fixed amount of charge from capacitor 68 that reduces the average value of the charge on capacitor 68. The amount of charge removed is represented by:\n\nQdn=T45*I71",
        "where\n\n    \n    \n        Qdn\u2014the charge removed from capacitor 68,\n        T45\u2014the width of the pulse of generator 45, and\n        I71\u2014the current of source 71.",
        "Reducing the value of the voltage on capacitor 68 reduces the value of the frequency control signal applied to source 52 and the current supplied by source 52. Decreasing the current supplied to charge capacitor 53 charges capacitor 53 slower and decreases the operating frequency of the CLK and Ramp signals and increases the corresponding operating period of controller 25. Decreasing the operating frequency of controller 25 increases the time between leading edges of the PWM drive signal on output 82. It should be noted that the width of the PWM drive signal on output 82 is different from the period between leading edges. After disabling transistor 72, the value of the frequency control signal remains substantially constant because of the high input impedance of source 52. The value of the frequency control signal remains substantially constant until oscillator 50 generates another asserted CLK signal to assert another PWM drive signal. The amount of the change in the value of the variable frequency control signal and the corresponding frequency of the CLK signal can be adjusted by changing the ratio of the current from sources 66 and 71, or changing the value of either of capacitor 68, or changing the width of the pulse formed by generator 45.",
        "Outputs 37 and 38 remains negated and transistors 22 and 23 remain disabled until oscillator 50 generates another cycle of the CLK signal. As long as the current required by the load remains light, the DCM operation continues for each cycle of the CLK signal. At some point during DCM operation, Qup and Qdn can become equal and controller 25 operates in an equilibrium condition that keeps the operating frequency of controller 25 substantially constant. The duration of the pulse formed by generator 45 affects where the equilibrium condition occurs. Consequently the width of the pulse generally is selected to ensure that the equilibrium can occur in a steady state condition. In one embodiment, the width of the pulse is between approximately twenty and two hundred (20-200) nanoseconds in order to remove the fixed charge from capacitor 68 to achieve the equilibrium.",
        "As explained previously, the value of the variable frequency control signal is reduced only during DCM operation.",
        "During large transient conditions, the output voltage on output terminal 13 may change a large amount and the load connected thereto may require a large change in the load current. Transient comparator 30 is used to form a quick change in the value of charging current 77 during transient conditions and during start-up conditions in order to provide the desired current to the load. Comparator 30 compares the error signal from amplifier 28 to the third reference voltage from reference 26. The value of the third reference voltage is selected to be near a value the feedback signal that represents a large change in the output voltage. Typically, the value of the third reference voltage is larger than the first reference voltage in order to accomplish the quick change. When the output voltage decreases a large amount, the value of the error signal increases. If the error voltage increases to a value approximately equal to or greater than the third reference voltage, the output of comparator 30 is asserted which enables transistor 70 to connect capacitor 68 to the internal operating voltage from regulator 27. Enabling transistor 70 quickly charges capacitor 68 thereby increasing the value of the frequency control signal and the corresponding frequency of the CLK signal.",
        "The width of the pulses created by generator 45 typically is dependent on the input voltage on input 80. This is illustrated by the input of generator 45 that is connected to input 80. As the voltage on input 80 increases, the width of the pulse from generator 45 may decrease. Such a decrease reduces the amount of charge removed from capacitor 68 thereby reducing the frequency dependency on the input voltage. In some embodiments, this voltage dependency is a result of current sources that are connected to receive power from input 80.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 1, system 10 is coupled in a buck configuration. However, those skilled in the art will realize that controller 25 may also be coupled in a any other type of dc-dc converter having a switching oscillator including boost or buck-boost configurations that have power supply controllers coupled as current mode, feed-forward, voltage mode or other types of controllers.

        "In view of all of the above, it is evident that a novel device and method is disclosed. Included, among other features, is forming the oscillator of a power supply controller to have a frequency that is responsive to the charging current of a inductor of a power supply system in which the power supply controller is configured. Changing the frequency of the oscillator responsively to the current through the inductor improves the efficiency of the power supply controller in light load current conditions by reducing the operating frequency of the power supply controller during DCM operation. Additionally, changing the frequency to improve efficiency does not require a lot of control logic thereby reducing the cost of the power supply controller. Additionally, the oscillation frequency is more easily controlled.",

For example, circuit 65 may be replaced with any type of low pass filter or integrator.
