        "A resin layer 20 is formed on the semiconductor substrate 10. The resin layer 20 is formed so that a part of the semiconductor substrate 10 (part of the passivation film 18, for example) is exposed. The resin layer 20 is an electrical insulating layer. The resin layer 20 does not contain conductive particles. The resin layer 20 may have a stress relief function. The resin layer 20 may be formed of a polyimide resin, silicone-modified polyimide resin, epoxy resin, silicone-modified epoxy resin, benzocyclobutene (BCB), polybenzoxazole (PBO), or the like. The resin layer 20 may be formed of a material having a light shielding property. The resin layer 20 is formed to avoid the top of the electrodes 16. At least a part of the resin layer 20 may be formed on the integrated circuit 12 (or active region).",
        "The semiconductor device includes wiring pattern 22 electrically connected with the electrodes 16. The wiring pattern 22 is formed so that a part of the wiring pattern 22 overlaps the electrode 16. The wiring pattern 22 is formed to extend to the resin layer 20 (upper surface of the resin layer 20, for example). The wiring pattern 22 may pass over the passivation film 18. The wiring pattern 22 may be formed of a three-layer structure consisting of a TiW sputter interconnect layer, a Cu sputter interconnect layer, and a Cu plating interconnect layer, for example.",
        "A plurality of external terminals (solder balls, for example) 24 are formed on the wiring pattern 22. The external terminals 24 may be formed of soft solder or hard solder. As the soft solder, solder containing no lead (hereinafter called lead-free solder) may be used. As the lead-free solder, a tin-silver (Sn\u2014Ag) alloy, tin-bismuth (Sn\u2014Bi) alloy, tin-zinc (Sn\u2014Zn) alloy, or tin-copper (Sn\u2014Cu) alloy may be used. At least one of silver, bismuth, zinc, and copper may be added to these alloys. The external terminal 24 is formed on the resin layer 20 and is supported by the resin layer 20. Therefore, a part of the external force applied to the external terminal 24 is absorbed by the resin layer 20.",
        "The semiconductor device includes a plurality of dummy terminals 26. The dummy terminals 26 are not electrically connected with the electrodes 16. The dummy terminals 26 are not electrically connected with the external terminals 24. The dummy terminals 26 are supported by the resin layer 20. For example, the dummy terminals 26 may be formed on pads 28 formed on the resin layer 20.",
        "The dummy terminal 26 may be formed of the same material as the external terminal 24 (solder, for example). The dummy terminal 26 may be formed of a material different from the material for the external terminal 24 so that the dummy terminal 26 and the external terminal 24 differ in properties (elasticity, adhesion, and the like). If the dummy terminals 26 are formed of an adhesive, the dummy terminals 26 can be caused to adhere to a motherboard while being crushed. This enables the difference in size between the dummy terminals 26 to be absorbed. As a modification, a dummy terminal 27 shown in FIG. 4 includes a center portion formed of a resin and a surface layer formed of solder. This allows the dummy terminals 26 to be easily elastically deformed, whereby the dummy terminals 26 can be prevented from being removed from the interconnect pattern of the motherboard, even if external force is applied. Moreover, the dummy terminals 26 and the external terminals 24 can be connected at the same time by forming the surface layer by using solder.",
        "In the case where the upper surface of the resin layer 20 is in a shape of a rectangle, the dummy terminals 26 may be formed at least at a pair of corners on the diagonal of the rectangle. The upper surface of the resin layer 20 may be divided into a first region which is located on the end and a second region which is closer to the center than the first region. In this case, the dummy terminals 26 may be formed in the first region and the external terminals 24 may be formed in the second region. According to the present embodiment, since bonding strength can be increased by the dummy terminals 26 when bonding the semiconductor device to a motherboard or the like, electrical connection failure of the external terminals 24 can be reduced.",
        "The semiconductor device may include a second resin layer (protective layer such as a solder resist) 30. The second resin layer 30 is formed on the resin layer 20. The second resin layer 30 is formed to cover the wiring pattern 22 so as to avoid an area of the wiring pattern 22 in which the external terminal 24 is formed (land, for example). An opening which exposes the wiring pattern 22 on the resin layer 20 is formed in the second resin layer 30. The external terminal 24 is connected with the wiring pattern 22 through the opening formed in the second resin layer 30. The second resin layer 30 is in contact with at least the base of the external terminals 24. The second resin layer 30 may cover the electrodes 16.",
        "In a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device according to the present embodiment, a semiconductor wafer is used as the semiconductor substrate 10. The resin layer 20 is formed on the semiconductor substrate 10 (on the passivation film 18, for example). The formation process of the resin layer 20 may include applying a resin precursor (thermosetting resin precursor, for example) to the semiconductor substrate 10, or forming a resin precursor layer by spreading a resin precursor on the semiconductor substrate 10 by spin coating. A continuous or integral resin precursor layer may be formed by using a radiation sensitive resin precursor having a property sensitive to radiation (light (ultraviolet light or visible light), X-rays, or electron beams), and the resin precursor layer may be patterned. The resin precursor layer is patterned by applying lithography. The resin layer 20 may be formed by printing (screen printing, for example). The resin layer 20 may be formed of either a plurality of layers or a single layer. The resin layer 20 is formed to avoid the top of the electrodes 16. The resin layer 20 may be formed to avoid a cutting region of the semiconductor substrate 10.",
        "The wiring pattern 22 are formed to be electrically connected with the electrodes 16. The wiring pattern 22 is formed to extend to the resin layer 20. The wiring pattern 22 is formed to pass over the electrode 16. The wiring pattern 22 may pass on the side surface of the resin layer 20. The wiring pattern 22 may be formed to include a land (area wider than the line). The external terminal 24 is formed on the land. The wiring pattern 22 may be formed of either a single layer or a plurality of layers. For example, a TiW sputter film and a Cu sputter film are stacked in that order by sputtering, and a plating resist film is then formed. An opening corresponding to the wiring pattern 22 is formed in the plating resist film by using photolithographic technology, and a Cu plating interconnect layer is formed by copper electroplating through the opening. The plating resist film is then removed and a Cu sputter interconnect layer and a TiW sputter interconnect layer are formed by etching the Cu sputter film and the TiW sputter film by using the Cu plating interconnect layer as a mask to form the wiring pattern 22.",
        "The second resin layer 30 may be formed on the resin layer 20. The description of the resin layer 20 may be applied to the second resin layer 30. The second resin layer 30 may be a solder resist. The second resin layer 30 is formed to cover the wiring pattern 22 excluding a part (center of the land, for example) of the wiring pattern 22. The second resin layer 30 may be formed so that the cutting region of the semiconductor substrate 10 is exposed.",
        "The external terminals 24 are formed on the wiring pattern 22 so as to be supported by the resin layer 20. The external terminals 24 may be formed by applying a conventional method. The dummy terminals 26 are formed so as to be supported by the resin layer 20. The pads 28 may be formed on the resin layer 20, and the dummy terminals 26 may be formed on the pads 28.",
        "A third resin layer (not shown) may be formed on the second resin layer 30, if necessary. The description of the resin layer 20 may be applied to the third resin layer. The third resin layer is formed to cover an area other than the top of the external terminals 24. This enables stress which occurs due to external force applied to the external terminals 24 to be dispersed. This also enables bonding between the external terminals 24 and the wiring pattern 22 to be reinforced. The third resin layer may be formed to cover the entire semiconductor substrate 10 and then patterned. The third resin layer may be formed to cover the external terminals 24 and be removed from the top of the external terminals 24. The third resin layer may be patterned by applying lithography. A part of the third resin layer may be removed by using a laser or ashing.",
        "As shown in FIG. 5, the semiconductor substrate 10 may be cut (diced or scribed). If the resin layer 20 and the second resin layer 30 are not formed in the cutting region of the semiconductor substrate 10, clogging of a cutter (or blade) 32 can be prevented since the resin is not cut. The semiconductor device is thus obtained.",
        "FIG. 6 is illustrative of a semiconductor device according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In the present embodiment, a conductive film 42 is formed below the external terminals (not shown) and dummy terminals 40. The conductive film 42 shown in FIG. 6 is formed on the semiconductor substrate 10 (on the passivation film 18, for example) under a resin layer 44. However, the conductive film 42 may be formed inside the resin layer 44. The conductive film 42 may be formed to cover the integrated circuit 12 (region in which the active element is formed, for example). This enables an electromagnetic wave shielding effect for the integrated circuit 12 to be obtained.",
        "As a modification, a conductive film 50 may be divided into a plurality of sections 52 provided at an interval from each other, as shown in FIG. 7. The influence of internal stress of the conductive film 50 on the semiconductor substrate 10 can be reduced by dividing the conductive film 50. The conductive film 50 is formed so that the integrated circuit 12 (region in which the active element is formed, for example) is located in the region in which the sections 52 are formed (region including the sections 52 and the space between the sections 52). This enables the electromagnetic wave shielding effect for the integrated circuit 12 to be obtained.",
        "In the examples shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the conductive film 42 (or 50) is electrically connected with the dummy terminals 40 without being electrically connected with the electrodes 16. In more detail, through-holes 46 are formed in the resin layer 44 so as to overlap a part of the conductive film 42 (or 50). A wiring pattern 48 is formed from the conductive film 42 (or 50) so as to pass on the inner surface of the through-hole 46 and extend to the upper surface of the resin layer 44. The dummy terminals 40 are formed on the wiring pattern 48 so as to be supported by the resin layer 44. The material for the dummy terminal 40 may be selected from the materials used for the external terminal 24 (see FIG. 2). The electromagnetic wave shielding effect can be increased by electrically connecting the conductive film 42 (or 50) with GND through the dummy terminals 40.",

        "FIGS. 8 to 10 are illustrative of modifications of the dummy terminals. These modifications may be applied to the first and second embodiments. As shown in FIG. 8, dummy terminals 100 may be formed to be larger than all the external terminals 22. This enables adhesion of the dummy terminals 100 to be increased. As shown in FIG. 9, at least two dummy terminals 110 may be disposed to be adjacent to each other. At least two dummy terminals 110 may be unified by melting the dummy terminals 110. This enables adhesion of the dummy terminals 110 to be increased without changing the size of the dummy terminals 110. In the case where a resin layer 120 has an oblong shape (rectangle or oval, for example) as shown in FIG. 10, dummy terminals 122 may be formed on both ends of the oblong shape in the longitudinal direction.",
        "FIG. 11 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a semiconductor device according to a third embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 12 is a bottom view of the semiconductor device.

A semiconductor chip (IC chip, for example) 64 is mounted (surface-mounted, for example) on the surface of the interposer substrate 60. The semiconductor chip 64 is connected with the interconnect layer 62 through bumps 66 and is sealed with a mold resin 68.",
        "An interconnect layer 70 and lands 72 are formed on the back surface of the interposer substrate 60. The interconnect layers 62 and 70 are connected through through-holes 74 formed in the interposer substrate 60. The lands 72 are disposed on the outermost periphery of the interposer substrate 60. Dummy bumps (or dummy balls) 76 are formed on the lands 72. The dummy bumps 76 are disposed on the outermost periphery of the interposer substrate 60. External terminals (solder balls, for example) 78 are disposed more inwardly on the interposer substrate 60 than the dummy bumps 76. The external terminals 78 are connected with the interconnect layer 70.",
        "According to the present embodiment, the external terminals 78 can be prevented from being disposed on the outermost periphery (region in which frequency of connection failure is high) of the interposer substrate 60. Moreover, the connection state of the external terminals 78 can be reinforced by the dummy bumps 76 after mounting the interposer substrate 60 on the motherboard. Therefore, connection failure of the external terminals 78 can be reduced during surface mounting without increasing the number of mounting steps even if the size of the semiconductor device is increased, whereby reliability during secondary mounting of the semiconductor device to which the ball grid array is applied can be improved while preventing a decrease in throughput.",
