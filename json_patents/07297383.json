        "This application is related to U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/493,889 filed Aug. 8, 2003 from which priority is claimed.",
        "This invention relates to plastic newspaper covers, and more particularly, to thin plastic covers for newspapers which have an overlay with advertising printed on the outer surface thereof with an attached severable coupon.",
        "For many years newspapers were simply rolled and bound by wire or string before being thrown onto customers' lawns, porches or driveways. With the advent of thin film plastics, it became customary to fold or roll the newspaper and to enclose the folded or rolled newspaper in a sleeve of plastic before being thrown onto the customer's property. The plastic film had the advantage of protecting the paper from rain, snow, etc. The thin film plastic packages may be clear, colored, and in some instances have advertising printed on the package walls. It is also common place to distribute advertising flyers including coupons in newspapers and by direct mail. Samples of products also are distributed by direct mail.",
        "This invention is embodied in a thin plastic sleeve for distributing newspapers and a separate plastic overlay attached to the sleeve and a severable coupon attached to one end thereof. The invention also embodies the process for making the sleeve and package.",
        "In the drawings, wherein like numbers and letters refer to like parts wherever they occur:",
        "FIG. 1 is a detailed plan view of a folded newspaper enclosed in the sleeve of this invention;",
        "FIG. 2 is a sectional view taken along line 2-2 of FIG. 1;",
        "FIG. 3 is a sectional view taken along line 3-3 of FIG. 1;",
        "FIG. 4 is a sectional view taken along line 4-4 of FIG. 1;",
        "FIG. 5 is a perspective view of the invention showing a rolled newspaper enclosed in the sleeve of this invention; and",
        "FIG. 6 is a diagrammatic block diagram of the process of making the sleeve and advertising overlay and coupon of this invention.",
        "FIG. 1 shows the combined newspaper cover sleeve and advertising overlay and severable coupon package 10 which comprises a sleeve 11 which has an open end 12 and a closed or sealed end 13. A folded newspaper 14 is positioned inside the sleeve 11.",
        "Attached to the sleeve 11 along the side edges 15 is an advertising overlay 20. The overlay 20 is attached only at the side edges 15 and has an extension flap or free edge 21 which extends past the closed end 13 of the sleeve 11.",
        "The advertising overlay 20 has a line of perforations 22 in the flap 21 which defines a line of weakness allowing the end of the flap, on which is printed a coupon 23, to be severed from the overlay 20.",
        "Advertising indicia 24 preferably is printed on the outer surface of the overlay 20.",
        "FIG. 5 shows a modification of the invention in which the sleeve 30 is more cylindrical and the newspaper 31 is rolled and inserted into the sleeve 30.",
        "FIG. 6 shows a flow diagram of the process for making this invention. The sleeve 11 is first extruded as a single sheet of thin plastic. This is folded lengthwise and formed into onto a roll. The overlay 20 likewise is a single sheet of thin extruded plastic film, which also is formed in a roll.",
        "When an order is received, the overlay 20 is unrolled and printed with the appropriate indicia and the coupon also is printed on the free edge flap. The printed overlay 20 is re-rolled and both the folded sleeve 11 and the printed overlay 20 then are unrolled and located such that one edge of the overlay 20 is aligned with the sleeve open end 12 and the free edge 21 extends outwardly of and past the sleeve closed in 13. The free edge flange 21 is perforated at 22 to define the coupon 21.",
        "To form the products 10, a hot knife is used to simultaneously sever and seal the sleeve side edges 15 and to sever the side edges of the overlay 20. This also heat seals the overlay 20 to the sleeve 13 along the edges 15.",
        "The combined sleeve and overlay package 10 is then shipped to the publisher, distributor, etc., where the newspaper is placed in the sleeve 11 and the package 10 is distributed to the homeowners.",
        "In view of the above, it will be seen that the several objects and advantages of the present invention have been achieved and other advantageous results have been obtained. As various changes could be made in the above constructions without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense."
