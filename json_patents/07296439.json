Even more particularly, the invention relates to jewelry settings for displaying multiple faces or gems in a setting of a piece of jewelry, such as a ring, bracelet, pendant, brooch, necklace, religious icon, watch, earring, pin for clothing, hat pin, and the like. The setting may use a face rotatable about at least one axis and an engagement mechanism. The face may be a two-sided face or two separate faces, one facing outwardly away from the user and being visible, the other one of the faces being movable for facing toward the user and being hidden when the one face is visible.",

        "Another object of the invention is to provide a jewelry top face or setting which is easier to use, and more reliable than prior art devices.",
        "In summary, the invention is directed to a jewelry setting including an outer setting, an inner setting substantially disposed within the outer setting. A gem or jewelry face may be provided in the inner setting, and a further gem or face may be provided on the substantially opposite side of the first gem face, in the case of a two (2) face setting. The setting is configured to be moveable between a first position in which the first gem faces outwardly, and a second position in which the second gem or face faces outwardly. In the second or moved position, the first gem or face may be disposed so that it faces inwardly towards the user and is not visible to the viewer of the piece of jewelry.",
        "A securing or engagement device, such as a clasp may be provided on the setting for securing the faces in their respective display positions.",
        "A pivot may be provided to assist in the movement of the inner setting from a first display position to a second display position.",
        "The clasp may include a mouth and a mating pin or pivot arm. The pin maybe provided on the inner setting and the mouth may be provided on the outer setting, or vice versa.",
        "The pin and mouth may be configured and sized for securely engaging each other for ensuring that the setting remains in the desired position.",
        "The pin may be substantially or completely fixedly attached to one of the inner settings and outer settings, so as to reduce the number of moving parts.",
        "The setting may be provided with a further mouth configured for receiving the pin in the second position of the setting in which the second face or gem is displayed. One or more pivot elements, such as pivot pins and mating indentations or through holes may be provided to assist in guiding the movement of the inner setting from its first position to its second position.",
        "FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a jewelry setting according to the invention provided on a piece of jewelry, such as a ring;",
        "FIG. 2 is a top view of the embodiment of FIG. 1, showing the inner setting in its first display position with a first face or gem stone facing outwardly; and",

        "It will be understood that relative terms such as up, down, left, and right are for convenience only and are not intended to be limiting.",
        "FIGS. 1-3 illustrate an embodiment of a piece of jewelry, such as a ring 10, according to the invention.",
        "Ring 10 may include a ring body 14, a band 18, and a setting 20.",
        "Band 18 is illustrated in broken or phantom line, as are other parts of the illustrative piece of jewelry according to the invention, here shown as ring 10. The phantom or broken lines are used to indicate that the band 18 is merely an example of the type of jewelry to which the setting 20 may be attached. Setting 20 may be provided on essentially any type of jewelry, such as a ring, bracelet, pendant, brooch, necklace, religious icon, watch, earring, pin for clothing, hat pin, and the like.",
        "Setting 20 may include an outer setting 24 and an inner setting 28. A first face or first gem stone 34 may be provided in or on inner setting 28 and disposed so that it is visible in a first display position, such as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.",
        "As shown in FIG. 3, a second or opposite face or gem stone 38 may likewise be provided in inner setting 34. Second face 38 is configured for outward display when the inner setting 28 is in a second display position.",
        "A clasp 50 may be provided for securing inner setting 28 relative to outer setting 24. Clasp 50 may include a female portion or mouth 54 and a male portion or pin 58. Mouth 54 may be substantially C-shaped. Pin 58 may be provided on inner setting 28, as shown, or on outer setting 24. In the case where pin 58 is provided on outer setting 24, a mating female portion could be provided on inner setting 24.",
        "A further or second mouth 64 may be provided on outer setting 24.",
        "Mouth 64 would typically be used when the jewelry setting 20 is in its second display position in which second gem face 38 faces outwardly.",
        "One or more pivot elements may be provided. For example, a pivot 70 including a pivot face 74 and a recess or hole 78 may be provided in outer setting 24. A mating pin 82 may be provided on inner setting 28. The pivot pin is configured for mating with the hole. A restraining portion is provided, and the restraining portion includes recess or hole 78. The restraining portion is configured for restraining the inner setting within the outer setting.",
        "The base may include a band configured for being worn on a user's finger, as shown. The outer setting 24 may be fixedly attached to the band, and the inner setting 28 and the first and second faces may then rotate about the first axis and move relative to the base 14, in use.",
        "The first mouth 54 may be substantially C-shaped, as shown, and the C-shaped first mouth extends away from the base.",
        "A first recess may be provided in the first mouth, the first recess being configured for detachably engaging the pin.",
        "A further pivot 90 may be provided including a pivot face 94, a hole 98, and a mating pin 102. The pin 82 and the pin 102 may define a first axis.",
        "The second mouth 64 may include a second recess configured for detachably engaging the pin 58, the second recess and the first recess defining a line, and the line extending substantially perpendicularly to the first axis.",
        "As illustrated, none of the clasp or pivot elements need be spring-loaded, or moveable relative to the setting on which they are provided. This reduces the number of moving parts and adds to the robustness and integrity of the jewelry setting.",
        "The jewelry and gem faces or gem stones may be made of any materials depending on the intended use and jewelry requirements. For example, one or both of faces 34, 38 may be synthetic gems, bas-reliefs, cloisonn\u00e9, cameos, and the like.",
        "It is likewise contemplated that one or more of the gem faces or gem stones may be detachably attached to the setting; e.g., with a spring-loaded device. In that manner, an even greater number of alternate faces could be provided, so that the user would have a larger variety of faces from which to choose for a single setting.",
        "While this invention has been described as having a preferred design, it is understood that it is capable of further modifications, and uses and/or adaptations of the invention and following in general the principle of the invention and including such departures from the present disclosure as come within the known or customary practice in the art to which the invention pertains, and as may be applied to the central features hereinbefore set forth, and fall within the scope of the invention or limits of the invention described herein, and within the scope and limits of the claims set forth below."
