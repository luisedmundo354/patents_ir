        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an insulation film, etching stopper, and hard mask. More particularly, the present invention relates to an insulation film, etching stopper, and hard mask preferably used in a dry etching process of interlayer dielectric films made of a material such as SiO2, fluorine-doped SiO2, organic or inorganic SOG (spin-on glass), or Low-k films or a dry etching process of barrier films such as SiN films, SiC films, or SiCN films in the manufacture of semiconductor devices.",
        "2. Description of Background Art",
        "Conventionally, interlayer dielectric films, barrier films, and the like used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices have been processed by dry etching using a halogen-containing gas as a major component. SiN (silicon nitride) films, SiC (silicon carbide) films, SiCN (carbonized silicon nitride) films, and the like formed by plasma CVD are mainly used as a hard mask or etching stopper for SiO2 materials, fluorine-doped SiO2 materials, organic or inorganic SOG (spin-on glass) materials, low dielectric interlayer dielectric films, and the like. These types of hard masks and etching stoppers have a high dielectric constant of 4 or more. If applied to high-speed devices that are processed in combination with the technique of low dielectric interlayer dielectric films such as FSG (fluorine-doped SiO2) films, OSG (organo silica glass) films, and porous Low-k films and the copper wiring technique, these hard masks and etching stoppers have been reported to require a high actual dielectric constant for the dielectric layer that makes it difficult to improve delayed transmission and the like (for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2002-76115). Therefore, development of a material having a dielectric constant of less than 4 and exhibiting a high etching selection ratio to materials such as SiO2, fluorine-doped SiO2, organic or inorganic SOG (spin-on glass) material, Low-k films, and organic or inorganic interlayer dielectric films used with SiN, SiC, or SiCN has been strongly desired.",

        "A coated film with a dry thickness of about 0.01-1.5 \u03bcm is obtained by a single application, and about 0.2-3 \u03bcm is obtained by one additional application of the composition of the present invention. The coated film is then dried at an ordinary temperature or by heating at about 80-600\u00b0 C. for 5-240 minutes, thereby forming the coated film (cure film) that can be used as an interlayer dielectric film. A hot plate, oven, furnace, or the like can be used for heating the coated film in air, in nitrogen or argon, under vacuum, or under reduced pressure in which the oxygen concentration is controlled. In particular, if heated at 100-450\u00b0 C. for 1-240 minutes in the presence of oxygen, a three-dimensional cross-linking structure in which oxygen atoms are introduced in carbosilane can be formed. If the three-dimensional cross-linking structure is formed, the polycarbosilane becomes insoluble in solvents and is maintained stable during a fabrication process with heating or the like. The three-dimensional cross-linking structure can also be formed by adding a peroxide, diazo compound, or the like to the coating composition and heating the composition instead of curing in the presence of oxygen. The coated film can also be cured by irradiating with active energy rays such as electron beams or ultraviolet rays.",

Specifically, the organosilane polymer has a dry etching selection ratio to the silicon oxide-based interlayer dielectric film and the organic polymer (A)-based interlayer dielectric film of 1/3 or less, and generally 1/5 or less. Therefore, the organosilane polymer of the present invention can function as an etching stopper or a hard mask.",
        "In the present invention, the organosilicon polymer functions as an etching stopper when formed under the interlayer dielectric film and as a hard mask when formed on the interlayer dielectric film.",
        "Methods for forming the etching stopper, hard mask, and damascene structure will now be described in detail.",
        "Etching Stopper",
        "When the interlayer dielectric film is etched by an etching process, the interlayer dielectric film is first formed on the etching stopper and a mask film having openings is formed on this interlayer dielectric film to give a laminated structure. Various methods can be used for forming openings in the mask film. One method of forming openings in the mask film is a lithographic technique using visible rays, ultraviolet rays, or electron beams and a photosensitive polymer (photoresist).",
        "A specific pattern can be formed on the interlayer dielectric film by etching the interlayer dielectric film through the openings in the mask film. Either wet etching or dry etching can be applied to etching the interlayer dielectric film. An electric circuit pattern is given as an example of the specific pattern formed on the interlayer dielectric film.",
        "The etching speed is preferably the same at any point on the interlayer dielectric film. However, the etching speed may vary by location due to unevenness in the etching gas concentration, flow rate, temperature, and the like in the case of dry etching and due to unevenness in the concentration and convection of the etching solution and unevenness in the temperature in the case of wet etching. For this reason, if the etching time at the location where the etching speed is the slowest is applied, the etching gas or the etching solution reaches the lowest layer of the interlayer dielectric film all over the film except for the location where the etching speed is the slowest and chemically reacts with the materials existing below the interlayer dielectric film.",
        "If an etching stopper is formed under the interlayer dielectric film, the chemical reaction due to the etching gas or the etching solution in the layer below the etching stopper can be prevented. If the speed to etch the etching stopper is slower than the speed to etch the interlayer dielectric film, the thickness of the etching stopper to prevent the etching gas or the etching solution from chemically reacting with the materials existing below the interlayer dielectric film can be reduced. For example, when a low induction insulating film is used as the interlayer dielectric film, a thin etching stopper is desirable since the relative dielectric constant of the interlayer dielectric film is larger than that of the etching stopper.",
        "Hard Mask",
        "In the case where the etching selection ratio of the interlayer dielectric film to the photoresist is insufficient, the case where the photoresist film thickness is too thin to resist etching of the interlayer dielectric film, and other similar cases, the opening pattern in the photoresist is transcripted onto a hard mask with a high etching selection ratio and the etching operation is carried out using the opening pattern on the hard mask.",
        "In this case, a hard mask is formed on the interlayer dielectric film. A mask film with openings is further formed on the hard mask to give a laminated structure. Various methods can be used for forming openings in the mask film. One method of forming the openings in the mask film is a lithographic technique using visible rays, ultraviolet rays, or electron beams and a photoresist.",
        "A specific pattern can be formed on the hard mask by etching the hard mask through the openings in the mask film. Either wet etching or dry etching can be applied to etching the hard mask. An electric circuit pattern is given as an example of the specific pattern formed on the hard mask. After removing the photoresist by means of a dry method (ashing) or wet method (wet delamination), the interlayer dielectric film is etched using the circuit pattern transcripted onto the hard mask as a mask.",
        "Damascene Structure Forming Method",
        "The damascene structure is formed by forming a pattern of trenches and via-holes in the interlayer dielectric film, filling a circuit metal in the trenches and via-holes, and removing excessive metal by the chemical machine polishing (CMP) method. There are two methods for forming a damascene structure. One is a single damascene forming method wherein trenches and holes are separately formed, filled with a metal, and polished by CMP and the other is a dual damascene forming method wherein the process of forming trenches and holes, filling them with the metal, and polishing by the CMP is carried out simultaneously only one time for the trenches and holes.",
        "The structure obtained by the dual damascene forming method of the present invention is characterized by being composed of two insulating film layers with a layer functioning as both the etching stopper and the hard mask interposed between them. (see FIG. 2) Such a laminated structure can be obtained by sequentially laminating the interlayer dielectric film formed by the plasma CVD method or the coating method, the etching stopper film formed by the plasma CVD method or the coating method, and the interlayer dielectric film formed by the plasma CVD method or the coating method. Wiring trenches are formed in the first and second interlayer dielectric films by photolithographic and etching processes. A uniform surface can be obtained more easily with an increased etching process allowance by interposing the etching stopper film between the first and second interlayer dielectric films. Via-holes can be formed in the second interlayer dielectric film by transcripting the via-hole pattern onto the etching stopper film.",
        "Wiring for a circuit can be formed in the laminated structure after the photolithographic and etching processes by forming damascene grooves and/or via-holes, coating the damascene grooves and/or via-holes with a barrier metal, and filling the grooves and/or via-holes with copper.",
        "The etching stopper obtained in this manner is useful for fabricating semiconductors such as LSI, system LSI, MPU, CPU, DRAM, SDRAM, RDRAM, and D-RDRAM due to its excellent resistance to the etching process.",
