The oil will be selected from those which are pharmaceutically acceptable; for example sesame or peanut oil may be employed. The non aqueous component of a partially aqueous vehicle will be selected those which are pharmaceutically acceptable; for example, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, may be employed. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably pH less than 8) if necessary. The aqueous and partially aqueous solutions are suitable for intravenous injection purposes. The aqueous, partially aqueous, and oily solutions are suitable for intraarticular, intramuscular and subcutaneous injection purposes. The preparation of all these solutions under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art."
