        "The present invention relates to an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display panel and, more specifically, to driving the OLED display panel without generating crosstalk.",
        "An OLED display panel is generally comprised of an array of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) that have carbon-based films or other organic material films between two charged electrodes, generally a metallic cathode and a transparent anode typically being glass. Generally, the organic material films are comprised of a hole-injection layer, a hole-transport layer, an emissive layer and an electron-transport layer. When voltage is applied to the OLED cell, the injected positive and negative charges recombine in the emissive layer and create electro-luminescent light. Unlike liquid crystal displays (LCDs) that require backlighting, OLED displays are self-emissive devices\u2014they emit light rather than modulate transmitted or reflected light. Accordingly, OLEDs are brighter, thinner, faster and lighter than LCDs, and use less power, offer higher contrast and are cheaper to manufacture.",
        "An OLED display panel is driven by a driver including a row driver and a column driver. A row driver typically selects a row of OLEDs in the display panel, and the column driver provides driving current to one or more of the OLEDs in the selected row to light the selected OLEDs according to the display data.",
        "Conventional OLED display panels have the shortcoming that cross-talk is generated in the display panel. The problem of cross-talk in conventional OLED display panels will be explained in greater detail below with reference to FIG. 1.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional OLED display panel driven by a conventional driver. The OLED display panel 100 comprises an array of OLEDs 102 coupled between the rows and columns of the display panel 100. The anodes of the OLEDs 102 are coupled to the columns and the cathodes of the OLEDs 102 are coupled to the rows of the display panel 100. The OLED display panel 100 is driven by driver including a row driver 120 and a column driver 140.",
        "The row driver 120 includes row driver control circuitry (not shown) configured to couple the cathodes of the OLEDs associated with a row ( . . . ROW(n\u22121), ROW(n), ROW(n+1), ROW(n+2) . . . ) of the display panel 100 to either a low voltage (e.g., GND) via resistors ( . . . RL(n\u22121), RL(n), RL(n+1), RL(n) . . . ) by closing the switches 126 and opening the switches 124 to select the row or to a high voltage (e.g., VCC) by closing the switches 124 and opening the switches 126 to unselect the row. For example, in FIG. 1, ROW(n) is shown selected with the switch 126 associated with ROW(n) being closed to couple ROW(n) to GND. The selection of ROW(n) by the row driver 120 forward-biases the OLEDs 102 coupled to ROW(n).",

Thus, the current ( . . . I(n\u22121), I(n), I(n+1), I(n+2) . . . ) from the current sources 142 is generated to be, for example, 0 or Iw.

In contrast, the current Iw will flow through the OLEDs coupled between row F and the columns 1-30 and columns 61-100 to light the OLEDs but not between row F and columns 31-60 on row F, making the total sink current Isink(F) for row F merely 70\u00d7Iw. Therefore, the sink voltages Vsink(E) and Vsink(F) on the resistors RL(E) and RL(F) coupled to rows E and F, respectively, will be: Vsink(E)=(Iw\u00b7100)\u00b7RL(E), and Vsink(F)=(Iw\u00b770)\u00b7RL(F).

The driving voltage versus brightness characteristics 702 are identical for the OLEDs on both rows, ROW(E) and ROW(F) (FIG. 6), for a given column driving voltage, since the sink voltages Vsink(E) and Vsink(F) are identical as explained with reference to FIG. 6. Thus, the OLEDs on both rows, ROW(E) and ROW(F), will have the same brightness.",
        "FIG. 8 illustrates a sample image that would be actually displayed on an OLED display panel 500 by the display data, according to one embodiment of the present invention. Because the brightness of the OLEDs on rows Row(E) and Row(F) are the same, the \u201cwhite\u201d regions 606 on Row(F) would display \u201cwhite\u201d having the same brightness as the \u201cwhite\u201d displayed in regions 604 on Row(E).

Then, the process ends 908.",
        "The present invention has the advantage that the voltage drops across the variable resistors 522 are uniform from row to row regardless of the amount of sink current Isink(n) on the rows, because the resistance values of the variable resistors 522 are adjusted based upon the display data corresponding to the rows, which is also proportional to the expected sink current Isink(n) for the rows. Therefore, the bias voltage on the cathodes of the OLEDs is same from row to row, and thus the OLEDs display the same brightness from row to row. Accordingly, the OLED display panels driven by the driver in accordance with the present invention does not show crosstalk.",
        "Although the present invention has been described above with respect to several embodiments, various modifications can be made within the scope of the present invention. For example, the resistances of the variable resistors may be adjusted not only based upon sum of the display data (which is a digital value) but also based upon the sum of the driving current (which is an analog value) driving the OLEDs coupled between the columns and the selected row. In such case, the driver may further include analog-to-digital converters for converting the driving current to digital values that can be used to control the variable resistors. In addition, the present invention is not limited to any particular-format or number of bits for representing the sum of the display data. Nor is the present invention limited to any particular number of bits used for the display data (e.g., 1 bit or 2 bit display data).",
        "Accordingly, the disclosure of the present invention is intended to be illustrative, but not limiting, of the scope of the invention, which is set forth in the following claims."
