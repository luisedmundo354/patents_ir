        "One group of anti-cancer agents comprises antimetabolites having antifolate activity, such as the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, methotrexate and the thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitors CB3717, raltitrexed and ZD9331. CB3717 is described and claimed in EP-B-0031237, raltitrexed in EP-B-0239362 and ZD9331 in EP-B-0562734. All of these TS inhibitors have demonstrable clinical activity in a range of solid tumours (see Cancer Treatment Reports, 1986, 70, 1335 and Beale et al., \u201cTomudex: Clinical Development\u201d in Antifolate Drugs in Cancer Therapy (ed.

        "TS catalyses the methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate to produce thymidine monophosphate which is required for DNA synthesis. The anticancer activity of these agents may be assessed in vitro by determining their inhibitory effect on that enzyme, and in cell cultures by their inhibitory effect on a range of mouse and human cancer cell lines (see Boyle et al., \u201cZD9331: Preclinical and clinical studies\u201d in Antifolate Drugs in Cancer Therapy (ed.

        "The \u03b1-isoform of the folate receptor (\u03b1-FR; membrane-associated folate-binding protein) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored cell membrane protein that has very high affinity for folic acid and the more biologically relevant reduced-folates (Kd \u02dc0.1 nM). The mechanism of folate internalisation is receptor-mediated endocytosis. The \u03b1-FR is overexpressed in many carcinomas, particularly those of ovarian origin where it is overexpressed highly and homogeneously in 90% of cases; see Cancer Res. 51, 5329-5338, 1991 (Campbell et al., 1991). Furthermore, high \u03b1-FR expression has been linked to aggressive, platinum resistant disease and poor prognosis\u2014see Int. J. Cancer 74, 193-198, 1997 and Int. J. Cancer 79, 121-126, 1998 (both Toffoli et al.). The \u03b2-isoform is widely expressed in tumours of epithelial and non-epithelial origin with expression levels being generally low/moderate and high, respectively, reviewed in Critical Rev. Therap. in Drug Carrier Systems 15, 587-627, 1998 (Reddy and Low).",
        "Folate receptors (\u03b1 and \u03b2) are expressed in some adult normal tissues (low to moderate expression). Significant expression of the \u03b1-FR is largely restricted to kidney proximal tubules and choroid plexus although it is suggested that it is localised to the apical membrane surface in these organs and therefore may not play a significant role in folate uptake from blood (Reddy and Low, ibid.). There may be a specialised function of the \u03b1-FR in the proximal tubules of the kidney to salvage folates that escape in the filtrate.",
        "The \u03b1-FR is hypothesised to be involved in cell signalling pathways. For example, in IGROV-1 ovarian carcinoma cells, immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that the \u03b1-FR is associated in membranes with the G protein G\u03b11-3, and the non-receptor kinase lyn.",
        "High FR expression in some tumours relative to normal tissues is being exploited in several areas of cancer medicine, including the selective tumour delivery of conjugates of folic acid and toxins, liposomes, imaging or cytotoxic agents (Reddy and Low, ibid). For example, folic acid-deferroxamine. 111In conjugates are detected only in FR-expressing turnouts and not normal tissues of mice, with the exception of kidney epithelial cells. The high selectivity of this approach resides in the very low and high affinities of folic acid (not a major component of plasma) for the RFC (reduced-folate carrier) and FR respectively. Thus antifolate drugs with similarly low and high affinity for the RFC and \u03b1-FR respectively could be highly selective for \u03b1-FR over-expressing tumours relative to normal tissues. In contrast with the folic acid conjugates they would not require intracellular cleavage to be active.",
        "We have now discovered that certain compounds within the general class of cyclopenta[g]quinazolines have an unexpectedly high level of selectivity for \u03b1-folate receptor expressing human tumour cell lines.

The activity of this new series of cyclopenta[g]quinazolines with C2-CH3 (RS-CB300638), C2-CH2OH (RS-CB300945) and C2-NH2 (RS-CB300944) substitutions were compared with three other series of quinazoline derivatives in mouse L1210-FBP cells and human tumour cell lines co-expressing the RFC and \u03b1-FR. The human A431-FBP cell line was transfected with the \u03b1-FR and sensitivity compared with the A431 cell line. Human nasopharengeal KB cells constitutively overexpress this receptor (see Bagnoli et al. Oncogene, 19, 4754-4763, 2000).",
        "In the quinazoline series, the C2-CH2OH analogues were found to have lower affinities for the \u03b1-FR of L1210-FBP cells (0.21 to 0.29) than the 2-CH3 (0.37 to 0.54) and particularly the 2-NH2 (1.3 to 1.7) counterparts. In the cyclopenta[g]quinazoline series the C2-CH3 analogue (CB300639) had a relative binding affinity of 0.57. However, unexpectedly the C2-CH2OH analogue (CB300945) had a higher affinity than predicted (0.71) and the C2-NH2 analogue (CB300944) had one lower than predicted (0.57). Thus in the cyclopenta[g]quinazoline series C2-substitution did not markedly affect binding to the \u03b1-FR. A similar pattern of binding was noted for \u03b1-FR expressed by A431-FBP cells (data not shown).",

However, very little activity of the C2-NH2 analogue (PS-CB300944) could be attributed to \u03b1-FR mediated uptake into either of these cell lines (Tables 13). On the other hand the C2-CH2OH analogue (RS-CB300945) was highly potent in A431-FBP and KB cells and more highly selective for these cells compared with A431 cells, than RS-CB300638.",
