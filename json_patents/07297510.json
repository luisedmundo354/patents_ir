        "This application is a 371 of PCT/US02/11963, filed Apr. 17, 2002, which claims the benefit of Ser. No. 60/284,373 filed Apr. 17, 2001.",
        "The invention is directed to a method of immobilizing enzymes on inert supports using cationic copolymers, preferably polyamines. The invention is also directed to the product produced thereby and the use of the product in industrially useful processes that use enzymatically-catalyzed reactions.",
        "Enzymes are biological catalysts. They are proteins and are commonly water-soluble. Enzymes are isolated and used in an extraordinarily large and diverse number of commercial applications, including analytical, medical, food-processing, and industrial applications. For example, enzymes are used to prepare food products such as cheese, bread, and alcoholic beverages; enzymes are used to resolve amino acids; enzymes are used in meat tenderizers, detergent formulations, leather tanning agents, and in digestive aids. Enzymes are also used extensively in the processing of starch, such as in starch hydrolysis, sucrose inversion, glucose isomerization, etc. These uses for enzymes, as well as many others, are addressed in great length in the relevant literature.",
        "Enzymes in solution are difficult to recycle while maintaining high catalytic activity. Even without attempting to recycle the enzymes, it is often difficult to maintain high catalytic activity of enzymes for any extended period. These factors often make enzymatic catalysis an expensive proposition due to the necessity to replace the enzyme often.",
        "To minimize the need for replacement, enzymes have been immobilized or otherwise insolubilized on inert supports or carriers. The enzyme remains catalytically active, but because the enzyme is affixed to a solid support, it can be removed from the reaction solution by filtering or screening. By immobilizing the enzyme on a solid support, the enzyme can be recycled more easily and the active useful life of each enzyme batch can be increased.",
        "Immobilized enzymes are used in many different reactor systems, such as in packed columns, stirred tank reactors, fluidized-bed reactors, etc. In general, immobilizing the enzyme provides one or more benefits, including more favorable conditions wherein the enzyme can be used, greater structural stability, increased active life span of the enzyme, minimized effluent problems, minimized material handling problems, and (potentially) increased activity of the enzyme itself.",
        "The patent literature describes a great many means of immobilizing enzymes on an inert support. One general method is to adsorb the enzyme at a solid surface as, for example, when an enzyme such as amino acid acylase is adsorbed on a cellulosic derivative such as DEAB-cellulose; papain or ribonuclease is adsorbed on porous glass; catalase is adsorbed on charcoal; trypsin is adsorbed on quartz glass or cellulose, chymotrypsin is adsorbed on kaolinite, etc.",
        "Another general method to immobilize enzymes is to trap an enzyme in a gel lattice, such as glucose oxidase, urease, papain, etc., being entrapped in a polyacrylamide gel; acetyl cholinesterase being entrapped in a starch gel or a silicone polymer; glutamic-pyruvic transaminase being entrapped in a polyamide or cellulose acetate gel, etc.",
        "A further general method is to use a cross-linking reagent to bind the enzyme to the support. In this approach, bifunctional or polyfunctional reagents that induce intermolecular cross-linking covalently bind the enzymes to the solid support. Glutaraldehyde or bisdiazobenzidine-2,2\u2032-disulfonic acid are conventionally used as cross-linking reagents.",
        "Conventional methods of immobilizing enzymes, however, all possess distinct drawbacks that detract from their use in industrial processes. For example, when an enzyme is directly adsorbed on the surface of a support, the binding forces that result between the enzyme and the support are often quite weak. Consequently, the enzyme is often readily desorbed from the support. Alternatively, the enzyme may be deactivated partially or extensively once immobilized (presumably due to conformational constraints caused by the binding reaction or due to adverse interactions between the support and the active site of the enzyme).",
        "A first embodiment of the invention is a composition of matter comprising an inert support, a cationic polymer adhered to the inert support, and an enzymatically-active enzyme adhered to the cationic polymer in the absence of any intervening cross-linking agent. The inert support comprises a material selected from the group consisting of silica, alumina, titania, diatomaceous earth, kaolin, glass, organic polymers, and cellulose. An inert support comprising silica is preferred. It is also preferred that he inert support is a particulate material having an average diameter equal to or smaller than about 30 mesh. In the preferred embodiment, the cationic polymer is a polyamine, more preferably still a copolymer comprising a di-C1-C6-alkyl amine co-polymerized with an \u03b1-halo-\u03c9-epoxy-C3-C6-alkane, such as dimethylaminoepichlorohydrin. The preferred enzyme comprises glucose isomerase.",
        "A second embodiment of the invention is directed to a method of making an enzyme adhered on a support. The method comprises first contacting an inert support with a cationic polymer, whereby the cationic polymer is adhered to the inert support. The inert support is then contacted with an enzyme under conditions wherein the enzyme adheres to the cationic polymer, absent any intervening cross-linking agent.",
        "A third embodiment of the invention is directed to method of performing an enzymatic reaction. Here, the method comprises catalyzing the enzymatic reaction using an enzyme adhered to an inert support as disclosed and claimed herein.",
        "The invention thus is directed to a method of securely binding enzymes to an inert support without adversely affecting the catalytic functionality of the bound enzyme.",
        "In general, the first embodiment is drawn to a method of adhering active enzymes to an inert support. The method comprises coating an inert support with a cationic copolymer, preferably a polyamine, and most preferably a di-C1-C6-alkylamino-epichlorohydrin copolymer, and then adhering enzyme to the coated support in the absence of any intervening cross-linking agent.",
        "The second embodiment of the invention is directed to the enzyme-coated inert support. Specifically, the second embodiment of the invention is directed to an inert support having coated thereon a layer of cationic copolymer preferably a polyamine copolymer and most preferably a di-C1-C6-alkylamino-epichlorohydrin copolymer), and a layer of active enzyme directly deposited on top of, or interspersed with, the cationic copolymer, preferably in the absence of any intervening cross-linking agent.",
        "The enzyme-coated support finds utility in virtually any reaction that requires enzymatic catalysis. The preferred use, however, is in the manufacture of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) from starch. The starch is obtained from a variety of seed crops, such as corn, wheat, rice, and maize, and root crops such as potato and cassava. The standard of identity for all converted syrups is HFCS. For the production of HFCS, the starch, a polymer, is first hydrolyzed to glucose, its monomeric unit, and the glucose is then isomerized enzymatically to fructose. Fructose is roughly 75% sweeter than sucrose. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, glucose isomerase is adhered to an inert support using a cationic copolymer, preferably a polyamine copolymer. The glucose solution is passed through and/or over the enzyme-coated support, whereby the glucose is enzymatically converted to fructose by the action immobilized GI. The process results in a production stream of HFCS without the inconvenience of having to remove or recycle solution-phase GI. Once the immobilized GI has reached the end of its useful life span, the solid-phase support can easily be removed from the reactor and replaced with new immobilized enzyme.",
        "The nature of the inert support is not critical to the functioning of the invention, so long as the support is, in fact, inert. Several are mentioned in the BACKGROUND section. A large number of such supports are known in the art and can be purchased from several worldwide vendors. Illustrative examples of supports that can be used in the present invention include inert mineral supports, such as silica, alumina, titania, diatomaceous earth, kaolin, etc.; glass supports, such as controlled pore glass; engineered organic-inorganic supports, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,141,857, issued Feb. 27, 1979 and assigned to UOP, Inc.; organic supports such as polystyrene beads, chlorofluorocarbon beads (e.g., TEFLON-brand polytetrafluoroethylene, NAFION-brand perfluorinated polymer), polyacrylamide gels, cellulose and modified cellulose, and the like. While no support is especially preferred over any other, good results have been achieved using a silica-based product designated R-648 and marketed by World Minerals (Santa Barbara, Calif.), alumina products obtained from UOP (Des Plaines, Ill.), and diatomaceous earth products from Eagle-Picher Mineral Industries (Reno, Nev.). Other commercial suppliers of inert supports include United States Silica (Berkeley Springs, West Va.), Prime Synthesis (Aston, Pa.), CPG, Inc. (Lincoln Park, N.J.), and DuPont Chemical Co. (Wilmington, Del.).",
        "The preferred cationic copolymer for use in the present invention is a polyamine. From among these polyamines, the preferred copolymer is formed from a di-C1-C6-alkyl amine and an \u03b1-halo-\u03c9-epoxy-C3-C6-alkane, such as epichlorohydrin (i.e. 1-chloro-2,3-epoxypropane). For sake of expository brevity, the description that follows will be limited to \u201cdialkylaminoepicholorohydrin,\u201d with the understanding that this term also extends to homologs thereof (e.g., copolymers of a di-C1-C6-alkyl amine and 1-halo-3,4-epoxybutane, 1-halo-4,5-epoxypentane, etc.) Thus, these copolymers are collectively designated herein as dialkylaminoepicholorohydrin copolymers. Structurally, such copolymers appear as follows:",
        "where m is an integer of from 1 to 4 and n is an integer that yields a copolymer having a molecular weight of from approximately 10,000 Da to greater than 1,000,000 Da.",
        "The specific copolymer formed between a di-C1-C6-alkyl amine and 1-halo-2,3-epoxypropane has the following structure:",
        "",
        "Such copolymers are easily manufactured by combining a dialkylamine with a \u03b1-halo-\u03c9-epoxy-C1-C6-alkane, such as epichlorohydrin, in the presence of excess base. Copolymers having a molecular mass of anywhere from about 10,000 Da to more than 1\u00d7106 Daltons are readily attainable by this route. Note that because of the quaternized nitrogen atoms in the polymer backbone, these copolymers are distinctly cationic.",
        "Dialkyaminoepicholorohydrin copolymers are also available commercially. The preferred commercial copolymer is sold under the trademark CYSEP by Cytec Industries (West Patterson, N.J.). The preferred formulation is designated CYSEP-349, although any of the copolymers in CYSEP-branded line will function. The CYSEP-349 copolymer has a molecular mass of roughly 250,000 Da. Currently, the following additional CYSEP-branded dialkylaminoepicholorohydrin copolymers can be obtained from Cytec Industries: CYSEP-572, CYSEP-573, CYSEP-577, CYSEP-581, CYSEP-587, and CYSEP-591. The product is usually delivered in solution form, with a solids level between about 10 and 50%, depending on the molecular mass.",
        "A sampling of the sizes of the CYSEP-branded products is given in the following table:",

        "There are many distinct advantages to the inventive method described herein as compared to conventional means for adhering enzymes to solid supports. Conventionally, an enzyme (such as glucose isomerase) is adhered to a support in a two-step process using polyethylenimine (PEI) and a bi-functional cross-lining reagent such as glutaraldehyde (GTA). In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the need for two reagents is eliminated; the enzyme can be firmly adhered to the inert support using only the cationic polymer. The present invention does not exclude the use of a cross-linker such as GTA; but the use of a cross-linker is not preferred.",
        "Another advantage of the present invention is that the presence of quaternary ammonium groups within the backbone of the copolymer molecule ensures that it maintains its very strong cationic charge throughout the pH range of most industrial, and notably, most food-processing operations. While not being bound by any particular interpretation or mechanism, it is believed that this intense cationic charge contributes to the strong bound activity seen in the enzyme-coated supports described herein.",
        "Implementation of this invention will immediately result in the replacement of the existing PEI/GTA binding procedure in the manufacture of immobilized glucose isomerase (and other enzymes) with one requiring the use of a dialkylaminoepichlorohydrin copolymer. This will lower the overall cost of bound glucose isomerase by both increasing the binding efficiency of the enzyme to the support and reducing the cost of raw materials.",
        "The method to coat the inert support is straightforward. As noted above, while the nature of the support is not critical to the invention, the preferred carrier for binding is a silica product marketed by World Minerals under the designation R-648. This product combines the desirable attributes of adequate surface area, pore size and overall mechanical toughness. Equally preferred are any number of alumina products manufactured by UOP (several have already been tested with good results) and a diatomaceous earth product from Eagle-Picher (this has also been tested with good results).",
        "All inert supports that have been evaluated thus far have been delivered with a small percentage of dust material. These fines, probably generated during shipment, are removed on the lab bench through a series of batch-agitated rinse steps. In production, the fines are removed by an upflow rinse through the fluidized bed of carrier.",
        "The residual rinse water is decanted from the settled carrier. The carrier is then recharged with water and dosed with a solution of copolymer. The copolymer is represented in grams on an as-is basis to the carrier, also on a weight basis, or % wt/wt. The copolymer dosing generally ranges from between about 2 to about 50%, and more preferably from about 7 to about 22%. Percentages above and below these ranges are encompassed by the invention. However, the stated ranges strike a good balance between achieving maximum bound activity and minimum use of the copolymer. The solution is vigorously mixed for about 2 hours, and then allowed to settle. After decanting the residual copolymer solution from the carrier, the carrier is rinsed at least three times (when making small batches on a lab bench) or subjected to continuous flow rinse in a production column.",
        "At this point, a layer of copolymer has been applied to the carrier. The next step is either to attach the enzyme directly onto the copolymer layer in the absence of any intervening cross-linking layer (preferred) or adding a cross-linking layer, such as a layer of glutaraldehyde, on top of the copolymer layer (less preferred). As shown in the Examples below, the incremental benefit of using a cross-linking layer on top of the copolymer is small when binding glucose isomerase. Nevertheless, the invention encompasses the use of a cross-linking agent. While the invention encompasses using a cross-linking layer, in the preferred embodiment, the enzyme is bound directly to the copolymer layer, in the absence of any intervening layer.",
        "While some experiments performed to date support the conclusion that a cross-linking layer enhances the quality of the binding of the enzyme to the support, the real question is whether the incremental improvement is economical in light of the extra cost and effort of including the cross-linking step. If a cross-linking step is used, the 100% equivalent glutaraldehyde dose varies between about 5% and 12% (wt/wt) of the starting dry carrier weight. The copolymer-coated support and the cross-linker are agitated for about 2 hours, and the remaining solution decanted. The treated support is rinsed as described about to remove any of the residual, non-bound glutaraldehyde before applying the enzyme to the support.",
        "The quantity of enzyme added to the support will depend primarily upon the quality of the carrier in terms of its ability to hold activity. For purposes of the discussion that follows, the enzyme used was glucose isomerase (available commercially from Enzyme Bio-Systems Ltd., Beloit, Wis.). This is for purposes of brevity and clarity only. The subject invention will work with any proteinaceous material, without limitation, including non-enzymatic proteins.",
        "Using glucose isomerase (GI) as the enzyme, carriers having bound activity ranging from between 0.82 and 1.09 U/g dry basis of carrier have been made. Because GI solutions are assayed as to their activity in units per milliliter, the total carrier weight and liquid enzyme activity can be used to calculate the total volume required. Additionally, magnesium salt in the form of either magnesium sulfate or magnesium chloride is added to a level of about 100 ppm magnesium atom basis. When binding glucose isomerase, the binding solution should have a pH between about 6 and 9, more preferably between about 6.2 to about 8.5. The pH of the binding solution can be adjusted with either dilute caustic or hydrochloric acid. In practice, such pH adjustment is not necessary as the solution normally falls within this range.",
        "The optimal pH for binding other proteins will vary, of course. The optimum pH, however, is easily determined based upon the isoelectric point of the enzyme and the known functional properties of the enzyme itself. That is, the optimum pH of the binding solution generally coincides with the pH that is optimum for enzyme activity. Such data is already known for a great many enzymes, and can be determined a priori by those skilled in the art for newly discovered enzymes. Thus, the optimum pH of any enzyme is determined by assaying the activity of the enzyme in solutions of various pH's. The isoelectric point of a protein is the pH at which there is no net electric charge on the protein. The isoelectric point is determined electrophoretically; at the isoelectric pH, the protein has no mobility in the gel (because the protein has no net charge).",
        "When using glucose isomerase, exposure time to the binding solution is generally from about 4 to about 8 hours at a temperature between about 15\u00b0 C. (59\u00b0 F.) and about 60\u00b0 C. (140\u00b0 F.). After settling and decanting the reaction solution, the newly bound carrier is rinsed with a sodium chloride (NaCl) solution having a concentration of between about 1.0 to 5.0%, rinsed with water, and then packed in a stabilizing solution, such as a 20% glycol solution.",
        "The following Examples are included to provide a more clear and consistent understanding of the subject invention. The Examples do not limit the scope of the invention described herein in any fashion.",
        "This Example compares the results of four different binding protocols: one using PEI and GTA in conventional fashion, one using CYSEP-349-brand copolymer and GTA, and two protocols using only the copolymer. Protocols 1 and 2 included 1.5% salt and were dosed to 1.27 U/g glucose isomerase.",
        "Protocol no. 1 used PEI as the binding layer while protocol no. 2 used CYSEP-349 copolymer. Both were used at 22 g per 150 g support. The PEI was in the form of a 35% (wt/wt) solution; the CYSEP-349 copolymer solution was used as delivered from the manufacturer (determined to be a 50% (wt/wt) solution). The results of protocols 1 and 2 normalized to standard PEI/GTA production were as follows.",

        "This Example illustrate the effect achieved by the use of GTA in the binding protocol. Two samples were bound with the CYSEP/GTA procedure and two with CYSEP only. The enzyme dosage was 0.91 U/g of dry carrier normalized to customary production dosage. One sample from each of the duplicate samples from each grouping was given a 5% salt wash for 2 hours, while the other duplicate had a salt treatment during binding. Batch assays were then run on all of the samples, with the following results obtained:",

Thus, this Example shows that GTA can be eliminated from the binding protocol, yet a very high bound activity was still achieved.",
