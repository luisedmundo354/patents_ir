        "This invention relates to novel fluorophenylborates and their use as activators in catalyst systems for olefin polymerization.",
        "Many catalyst systems for polymerizing olefins, including metallocene and Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems, include an activator or co-catalyst to increase the rate at which the primary catalyst, for example the metallocene complex, polymerizes olefin monomers. An activator may also affect the molecular weight, degree of branching, comonomer content and other properties of the resultant polymer. Typical activators include, for example, alumoxanes, aluminum alkyls and ionizing activators.",
        "Ionizing activators generally include a cation capable of abstracting an alkyl group, or breaking a carbon-metal bond, from the organometallic primary catalyst species together with a charge-balancing noncoordinating or weakly coordinating anion. One known class of ionizing activator are fluorophenylborates and, in particular, perfluorophenylborates, the use of which are reviewed by Eugene at al. in Chem. Rev. 2000, 100, page 1391.",
        "Recently, a variety of researchers have investigated the effect of substituting the fluorine atoms in fluorophenylborates, particularly at the para-position relative to the boron atom, with bulky groups with a view to increasing the solubility of the activator in the aliphatic solvents typically used in solution polymerization processes and to increasing the molecular weight of the resultant polymers. For example, in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998, 120, page 6287, Chen et al. disclose substituting the para fluorine with a \u2014Si(t-Bu)2Me group or \u2014Si(i-Pr)3 group, whereas substitution, again at the para-position, with an \u2014OSi(i-Pr)3 group is proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,541,410. International Patent Publication No. WO 01/81435 discloses para-substitution with an \u2014N(R)(C6F5) moiety, where R can be methyl, whereas para-substitution with a \u2014C6F5 moiety is proposed in Japanese Published Patent Application No. 9-15892 and with a \u2014CF(C6F5)2 moiety is proposed in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 122, page 1832.",
        "To date, however, little or no attention has been paid to substitution at the meta positions on the phenyl groups of fluorophenylborates.",
        "Accordingly, the invention resides in one aspect in a fluorophenylborate useful as an activator for an olefin polymerization catalyst, the fluorophenylborate being represented by the formula:\n\nCt+[B\u2014(ArfRn)4]\u2212\n\nwhere Ct+ is a cation capable of extracting an alkyl group from, or breaking a carbon-metal bond of, an organo metallic compound; Arf is a fluorophenyl group; n is 1 or 2; and each R is independently selected from a fluorophenyl group and a fluoronaphthyl group, provided that when n=1, each R group is connected at the 3-position relative the connection between the associated Arf group and the boron atom and, when n=2; the R groups are connected at the 3-position and the 5-position respectively relative the connection between the associated Arf group and the boron atom.",

In one preferred embodiment, Ct+ is a [4-t-butyl-N,N-dimethylanilinium] cation.",

        "For the purposes of this invention and the claims thereto, when a polymer is referred to as comprising a monomer, the monomer present in the polymer is the polymerized form of the monomer. Likewise when catalyst components are described as comprising neutral stable forms of the components, it is well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, that the active form of the component is the form that reacts with the monomers to produce polymers. In addition, a reactor is any container(s) in which a chemical reaction occurs.",

        "The term \u201ccatalyst system\u201d is defined to mean a catalyst precursor/activator pair. When \u201ccatalyst system\u201d is used to describe such a pair before activation, it means the unactivated catalyst (precatalyst) together with an activator and, optionally, a co-activator. When it is used to describe such a pair after activation, it means the activated catalyst and the activator or other charge-balancing moiety.",

These words are used interchangeably. Activator and cocatalyst are also used interchangeably. A scavenger is a compound that is typically added to facilitate oligomerization or polymerization by scavenging impurities. Some scavengers may also act as activators and may be referred to as co-activators. A co-activator, that is not a scavenger, may also be used in conjunction with an activator in order to form an active catalyst. In some embodiments a co-activator can be pre-mixed with the transition metal compound to form an alkylated transition metal compound. The transition metal compound may be neutral as in a precatalyst, or a charged species with a counterion as in an activated catalyst system.",
        "For purposes of this disclosure, the term \u201cfluorophenyl group\u201d means a phenyl group in which at least one hydrogen atom has been replaced by fluorine and is intended to include phenyl compounds in which other hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring have been replaced by other substituents, such as a hydrocarbyl substituent. The term \u201cperfluorophenyl group\u201d means that each phenyl hydrogen atom has been replaced by a fluorine atom except, in the case of the Arf group, the or each hydrogen atom that has been replaced by an R group.",
        "Similarly, the term \u201cfluoronaphthyl group\u201d means a naphthyl group in which at least one hydrogen atom has been replaced by fluorine and is intended to include naphthyl compounds in which other hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring have been replaced by other substituents, such as a hydrocarbyl substituent.

In one preferred embodiment, Ct+ is a [4-t-butyl-N,N-dimethylanilinium] cation (abbreviated herein as DMAH).",
        "Method of Synthesizing the Fluorophenylborate Activator",
        "The fluorophenylborate of the invention may be prepared by synthetic methods well known in the art. For example, when n=1 and each of R and Arf is a perfluorophenyl group, one of the bromide substituents in commercially available 1,3-dibromotetrafluorobenzene can readily be replaced by hydrogen by the sequential addition of one equivalent of EtMgBr, followed by an aqueous hydrochloric acid quench. The resulting 3-bromotetrafluorobenzene can then be used to produce 3-pentafluorophenyl-2,4,5,6-tetrafluorobenzene via a copper mediated coupling reaction using, for example, (C6F5)2Cu in dioxane, see Sakamoto et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 122, page 1832. The resulting biphenyl can then be converted to the corresponding anilinium borate using standard techniques.",
        "When n=2 and each of R and Arf is a perfluorophenyl group, synthesis can readily be achieved by initially brominating commercially available 1,3,5-trifluorobenzene to produce the corresponding trifluorotribromobenzene. One of the bromide substituents in the resulting trifluorotribromobenzene can then be replaced by hydrogen by the sequential addition of one equivalent of EtMgBr, followed by an aqueous hydrochloric acid quench. The resulting 3,5-dibromotrifluorobenzene can then used to make 3,5-bis(pentafluorophenyl)trifluorobenzene via a copper mediated coupling reaction. The resultant triphenyl can then be brominated to produce 3,5-bis(pentafluorophenyl)-1-bromotrifluorobenzene, which can then be converted to the corresponding anilinium borate using standard techniques.",
        "Olefin Polymerization Catalyst System",
        "The fluorophenylborate of the invention according to the invention is particularly useful as part of a catalyst system for polymerizing olefins. In such a catalyst system the fluorophenylborate is combined with an organometallic catalyst precursor to perform as an activator to increase the rate at which the catalyst precursor polymerizes olefin monomers and/or to affect the molecular weight, degree of branching, comonomer content or other properties of the resultant polymer.",
        "Organometallic precursors compounds suitable for use with the fluorophenylborate activator of the invention include the known organometallic, transition metal compounds useful in traditional Ziegler-Natta coordination polymerization, particularly the metallocene compounds known to be useful in coordination polymerization. These will typically include Group 3-10 transition metal compounds wherein at least one metal ligand can be abstracted by the cocatalyst activator, particularly those ligands including hydride, hydrocarbyl, and hydrocarbylsilyl, and lower alkyl-substituted (C1 to C10) derivatives thereof. Examples include hydride, methyl, benzyl, dimethyl-butadiene, etc. Ligands capable of being abstracted and transition metal compounds comprising them include those metallocenes described in, for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,198,401 and International Patent Publication No. WO 92/00333. Additionally, where the metal ligands include halogen, amido or alkoxy labile ligands (for example, biscyclopentadienyl zirconium dichloride) which do not allow for ready abstraction with the activating cocatalysts of the invention, they can be converted into suitable ligands via known alkylation reactions with organometallic compounds such as lithium or aluminum hydrides or alkyls, alkylalumoxanes, Grignard reagents, etc. See EP 0 500 944 and EP 0 570 982 for the reaction of organoaluminum compounds with dihalo-substituted metallocene compounds prior to addition of activating anion compounds.",

Generally, such metallocene compounds comprise mono- or biscyclopentadienyl substituted Group 3, 4, 5, or 6 transition metal compounds wherein the ancillary ligands may be themselves substituted with one or more groups and may be bridged to each other, or may be bridged through a heteroatom to the transition metal. Preferably the cyclopentadienyl rings (including substituted cyclopentadienyl-based fused ring systems, such as indenyl, fluorenyl, azulenyl, or substituted analogs of them), when bridged to each other, will be lower alkyl-substituted (C1 to C6) in the 2 position (with or without a similar 4-position substituent in the fused ring systems) and may additionally comprise alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkylaryl and or arylalkyl substituents, the latter as linear, branched or cyclic structures including multi-ring structures, for example, those of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,278,264 and 5,304,614. Such substituents should each have essentially hydrocarbyl characteristics and will typically contain up to 30 carbon atoms but may be heteroatom containing with 1-5 non-hydrogen/carbon atoms, e.g., N, S, O, P, Ge, B and Si.",

Though many of the above are directed to catalyst systems with alumoxane activators, the analogous metallocene compounds will be useful with the cocatalyst activators of this invention for active coordination catalyst systems, when the halogen, amide or alkoxy containing ligands of the metals (where occurring) are replaced with ligands capable of abstraction, for example, via an alkylation reaction as described above, and another is a group into which the ethylene group may insert, for example, hydride, alkyl, alkenyl, or silyl.",

A preferred operation is two solutions activated in-line. For more information on methods to introduce multiple catalysts into reactors, see U.S. Pat. No. 6,399,722 and International Patent Publication No. WO 01/30862. While these references may emphasize gas phase reactors, the techniques described are equally applicable to other types of reactors, including continuous stirred tank reactors, slurry loop reactors and the like. Polymerizations are carried out in either single reactor operation, in which monomer, comonomers, catalyst/activator, scavenger, and optional modifiers are added continuously to a single reactor or in series reactor operation, in which the above components are added to each of two or more reactors connected in series. The catalyst components can be added to the first reactor in the series.

        "Gas Phase Polymerization",
        "Generally, a fluidized gas bed process is used for producing polymers, with a gaseous stream containing one or more monomers being continuously cycled through the fluidized bed in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. The gaseous stream is withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and fresh monomer is added to replace the polymerized monomer. (See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,543,399, 4,588,790, 5,028,670, 5,317,036, 5,352,749, 5,405,922, 5,436,304, 5,453,471, 5,462,999, 5,616,661 and 5,668,228.)",

In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent medium to which monomer and comonomers along with catalyst are added. The suspension including diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liquid diluent employed in the polymerization medium is typically an alkane having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably a branched alkane. The medium employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. When a propane medium is used the process must be operated above the reaction diluent critical temperature and pressure. Preferably, a hexane or an isobutane medium is employed.",
        "In one embodiment, a preferred polymerization technique useful in the invention is referred to as a particle form polymerization, or a slurry process where the temperature is kept below the temperature at which the polymer goes into solution. Such technique is well known in the art, and described in for instance U.S. Pat. No. 3,248,179. The preferred temperature in the particle form process is within the range of about 85\u00b0 C. to about 110\u00b0 C. Two preferred polymerization methods for the slurry process are those employing a loop reactor and those utilizing a plurality of stirred reactors in series, parallel, or combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of slurry processes include continuous loop or stirred tank processes. Also, other examples of slurry processes are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,613,484.",
        "In another embodiment, the slurry process is carried out continuously in a loop reactor. The catalyst, as a slurry in isobutane or as a dry free flowing powder, is injected regularly to the reactor loop, which is itself filled with circulating slurry of growing polymer particles in a diluent of isobutane containing monomer and comonomer. Hydrogen, optionally, may be added as a molecular weight control.",
        "The reactor is maintained at a pressure of 3620 kPa to 4309 kPa and at a temperature in the range of about 60\u00b0 C. to about 104\u00b0 C. depending on the desired polymer melting characterisitcs. Reaction heat is removed through the loop wall since much of the reactor is in the form of a double-jacketed pipe. The slurry is allowed to exit the reactor at regular intervals or continuously to a heated low pressure flash vessel, rotary dryer and a nitrogen purge column in sequence for removal of the isobutane diluent and all unreacted monomer and comonomers. The resulting hydrocarbon free powder is then compounded for use in various applications.",

        "Homgeneous, Bulk, or Solution Phase Polymerization",
        "The catalysts described herein can be used advantageously in homogeneous solution processes. Generally this involves polymerization in a continuous reactor in which the polymer formed and the starting monomer and catalyst materials supplied, are agitated to reduce or avoid concentration gradients. Suitable processes operate above the melting point of the polymers at high pressures, from 1 to 3000 bar (10-30,000 MPa), in which the monomer acts as diluent or in solution polymerization using a solvent.",
        "Temperature control in the reactor is obtained by balancing the heat of polymerization with reactor cooling by reactor jackets or cooling coils to cool the contents of the reactor, auto refrigeration, pre-chilled feeds, vaporization of liquid medium (diluent, monomers or solvent) or combinations of all three. Adiabatic reactors with pre-chilled feeds may also be used. The reactor temperature depends on the catalyst used. In general, the reactor temperature preferably can vary between about 30\u00b0 C. and about 160\u00b0 C., more preferably from about 90\u00b0 C. to about 150\u00b0 C., and most preferably from about 100\u00b0 C. to about 140\u00b0 C. Polymerization temperature may vary depending on catalyst choice. For example a diimine Ni catalyst may be used at 40\u00b0 C., while a metallocene Ti catalyst can be used at 100\u00b0 C. or more.
