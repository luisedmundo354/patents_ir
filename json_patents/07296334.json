    "description": [
        "The present invention relates to a wiring harness manufacturing method and a wiring harness manufacturing apparatus for manufacturing a wiring harness arranged on a motor vehicle.",
        "Various kinds of electronic equipment are carried on a motor vehicle. Therefore, the wiring harness is arranged on the motor vehicle so that electric power from a power source and control signals from a computer can be supplied to the electronic equipment. The wiring harness has electric wires and connectors attached to end portions of the electric wires.",
        "The electric wire has a conductive core wire and an insulative covering portion covering the conductive core wire. The electric wire is a so-called covered or sheathed wire. The connector has a conductive terminal fitting and an insulative connector housing. The terminal fitting is attached to an end portion of the electric wire and is electrically-connected with the core wire of the electric wire. The connector housing is formed in a box-shape and accommodates the terminal fittings.",
        "When the wiring harness is manufactured or assembled, the electric wire is firstly cut in a fixed length, and the terminal fitting is attached to the end portion of the electric wire. The electric wires are connected as the need arises. Subsequently, the terminal fitting is inserted into the connector housing. Like this, the above-described wiring harness is manufactured or assembled.",
        "With regard to the electric wire of the wiring harness, the thickness of the core wire, material (for example, from view point of heat-resistance) of the covering portion, and service conditions should be distinguished. Here, the service conditions mean systems such as an air-bag system, an antilock brake system, and a power transmission system in which the electric wires are used.",
        "The electric wires of the wiring harness are variously colored and marked for distinguishing the above systems. When the prior art wiring harness is manufactured, the above coloring and marking are carried out in a process of manufacturing the electric wire by forming the core wire from conductive metal such as copper.",
        "On the other hand, various demands arise from users for the motor vehicle. That is, the motor vehicle is expected to have various kinds of electronic equipment. Consequently, the wiring harness sometimes consists of not less than 100 of the electric wires. Therefore, a factory to manufacture or assemble the wiring harness has to stock not less than 100 of electric wires, while making the stock control of the electric wires having each article number. And therefore, the cost for stocking the electric wires tends to increase.",
        "Further, for example, the electric wire with a determined article number needs to be set in a device to cut off the electric wire in a fixed length. However, since there exists a lot of article numbers of the electric wires, a mistake in the article number of the electric wire would arise. Therefore, the yield of the wiring harness is reduced, thereby causing reduction of the productive efficiency of the wiring harness.",
        "In order to solve such problems, the applicant of the present invention has suggested a wiring harness manufacturing method described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.61-245412. In this wiring harness manufacturing method, the electric wires are colored and marked just before each of the wire manufacturing step, the cutting step, the cover removing step, the terminal-crimping step, and the case insertion step.",
        "With respect to the above prior art wiring harness manufacturing method of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.61-245412, however, the coloring and the marking are carried out just before each of the steps of manufacturing or assembling the wiring harness as above.",
        "Therefore, in the wiring harness manufacturing method of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.61-245412, a device for coloring and marking the electric wire has to be provided on each of a wire cutting unit, a covering portion removing unit, a terminal crimping unit, and a terminal inserting unit. The prior art wiring harness manufacturing method also requires installation or mounting work of the above coloring and marking device between each two units, and requires the wiring harness to be set on each coloring and marking device.",
        "Like this, in the wiring harness manufacturing method of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.61-245412, the number of the coloring and marking device increases, which therefore increases the space for manufacturing the wiring harness.",
        "And also, the coloring and marking work totally requires long time, which lowers the productive efficiency of the wiring harness. Like this, the wiring harness manufacturing method of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.61-245412 requires high manufacturing costs of the wiring harness.",
        "In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to provide a wiring harness manufacturing method and a wiring harness manufacturing apparatus, wherein the above drawbacks of the prior art wiring harness manufacturing method and apparatus have been solved and therefore manufacturing costs of the wiring harness can be reduced.",
        "In the present invention, a wiring harness manufacturing method for assembling a wiring harness having electric wires and connectors attached to the electric wires comprises the steps of: a wire stocking step to stock the electric wires; and a cutting step to cut an electric wire stocked in the wire stocking step in a desirable length and to attach a terminal fitting of the connector to the electric wire, wherein, an outer surface of the electric wire is colored in at least one of the wire stocking step and the cutting step.",
        "Like this, the electric wire is colored in at least one of the wire stocking step and the cutting step. Like this, since the electric wire is not necessarily colored in all the steps, the device to color the electric wire needs not to be attached to all the units to carry out the wire stocking step and the cutting step.",
        "And, because the electric wire is not necessarily colored in all the steps, all the electric wires need not to be conveyed to the devices to color the electric wire from the units to carry out the wire stocking step and the cutting step. Further, the electric wire is colored in a step for assembling the wiring harness. Therefore, the article number (the kind of color of the outer surface) of the electric wire stocked by the wire stocking units can be reduced.",
        "In this specification, \u201cto color the outer surface of the electric wire\u201d means to color the outer surface of the covering portion of the electric wire with a colorant. The colorant is a liquid substance in which color material (organic substance for industry) is dissolved and dispersed in water or in other solvent. As the organic substance, there exists dyes and pigments (mostly organic substance and synthetic material). In the present specification, \u201ccolorant\u201d means both paint and coloring liquid.",
        "In the coloring liquid, the dye is dissolved or dispersed in the solvent. In the paint, the pigment is dispersed in the dispersion liquid. Therefore, when the outer surface of the covering portion is colored by the coloring liquid, the dye soaks into in the covering portion, and when the outer surface of the covering portion is colored by the paint, the pigment adheres to the outer surface without soaking into the covering portion. That is, \u201cto color the outer surface of the covering portion of the electric wire\u201d in the present specification means to dye the outer surface of the covering portion of the electric wire with the dye and also to paint the pigment on the outer surface of the covering portion of the electric wire.",
        "And, the solvent and the dispersion liquid should have an affinity for synthetic resin forming the covering portion of the electric wire so that the dye securely soaks into the covering portion of the electric wire and the pigment securely adheres to the outer surface of the covering portion of the electric wire.",
        "In the present invention, a wiring harness manufacturing method for assembling a wiring harness having electric wires and connectors attached to the electric wires comprises the steps of: a wire stocking step to stock the electric wires; and a cutting step to cut an electric wire stocked in the wire stocking step in a desirable length and to attach a terminal fitting of the connector to the electric wire, a joining step to connect the electric wires which have been cut in desirable lengthes by the cutting step and to which the respective terminal fittings have been attached, wherein, an outer surface of the electric wire is colored in both the wire stocking step and one of the cutting step and the joining step.",
        "Like this, the electric wire is colored in at least one of the wire cutting step and the joining step. Like this, since the electric wire is not necessarily colored in all the steps, the device to color the electric wire needs not to be attached to all the units to carry out the wire cutting step and the joining step.",

        "In the present invention, a wiring harness manufacturing apparatus for assembling a wiring harness having electric wires and connectors attached to the electric wires comprises: wire stocking units each to stock the electric wires; and cutting units each to cut the electric wires stocked in the wire stocking units in desirable lengthes and to attach terminal fittings of the connectors to the respective electric wires, wherein, a coloring means to color an outer surface of each of the electric wires is attached to one of the wire stocking units and the cutting units.",
        "Like this, the coloring means to color the electric wire are attached to one of the wire stocking units and the cutting units. Like this, the coloring means need not to be provided on all the wire stocking units and the cutting units. And, the electric wire is colored by the coloring means in a step for assembling the wiring harness. Therefore, the article number (the kind of color of the outer surface) of the electric wire stocked by the wire stocking units can be reduced.",
