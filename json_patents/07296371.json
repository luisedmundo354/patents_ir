    "description": [
        "The invention relates to a banner as is towed by aircraft and bears for example advertising.",
        "The known banners have a banner rod which is connected to the front end of the banner and which is also connected via the so-called \u201cbanner spider\u201d and via a tow rope to the aircraft which is towing the banner.",
        "In known banners it is not possible to connect them via the tow rope to the aircraft which is to tow the banner before take-off.",
        "Therefore the process takes place such that the banner is placed optionally folded on the runway and the banner spider is connected via a short connecting cable to the so-called \u201cloop\u201d (closed cable loop). The loop is attached to two rods so that one part is tensioned and the other part to which the banner spider is attached sags down. An aircraft to which a tow rope with hooks on the free end is attached at this point flies over the loop such that the upper horizontal piece of the loop is coupled to the tow rope.",
        "This is not only a time-consuming, but also an unsafe flight activity since there is the danger that the landing gear of the aircraft will hang up in the loop or the hook on the tow rope will become caught for example on the ground; in the worst case this leads to the aircraft's crashing.",
        "The object of the invention is to develop a banner of the initially named type such that it can be connected to the aircraft which is towing the banner before take-off.",
        "Preferred and advantageous embodiments of the banner as claimed in the invention are the subject matter of the dependent claims.",
        "Because disks which keep the banner rod at a distance from the ground are attached to the banner rod, the banner rod and the banner attached to it including the spider can be connected to the aircraft via the tow rope before take-off. The \u201cwind\u201d generated by the propeller of the aircraft which is taking off lifts the banner off the ground since the banner rod due to the disks is at a distance from the ground, therefore from the surface of the runway. Thus it is possible to take off without difficulties.",
        "There can be any number and type of disks which are used for example as wheels on the banner rod and they depend among others on the size (width) of the banner and its weight. But often two disks are sufficient.",
        "Other details, features and advantages of the invention follow from the description below with reference to the drawings in which one embodiment is shown.",
        "FIG. 1 shows in a schematic a banner which is being towed by an aircraft,",
        "FIG. 2 shows the banner which has been placed on the ground partially in an oblique view,",
        "FIG. 3 shows the banner (partially) in a view from the front,",
        "FIGS. 4 and 5 show the disks being used as wheels on the end of the banner rod, in a disassembled view.",
        "As is shown in FIG. 1, a banner 1 is being towed by an aircraft 2 to which it is coupled via a tow rope 3 and a banner spider 4. On the front end of the banner 1 there is a banner rod 5 on which there are disks 10 (wheels) on either side of the banner 1.",
        "Before take-off, the banner 1, as is shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, optionally folded, is placed on the runway 6, the disks 10 which are provided on the ends of the banner rod 5, in addition to the banner 1 which has been placed folded, resting on the surface of the runway 6 (these disks 10 are not shown in FIG. 2). This situation is shown in FIG. 3.",
        "If now the aircraft 2 takes off, the banner 1 which on its front end which is connected to the banner rod 5 is held by the disks 10 at a distance from the surface of the runway 6, at least over most of its length will be located at a distance over the runway 6 due to the wind of the propeller so that it does not hinder the take-off of the aircraft 2 by dragging on the ground 6.",
        "To keep the braking effect of the banner 1 and the banner rod 5 small, the disks 10 are mounted on the banner rod 5 preferably with a capacity to turn (freely), therefore they act as wheels.",
        "One possible embodiment of the disks 10 which act as wheels is shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 each in a disassembled view.",
        "FIG. 4 shows the disk 10 which is round and is reinforced to the right and left of its bearing opening 12 by running disk flanges 13 which are screwed on or riveted on so that it can run evenly and as much as possible without friction on the banner rod 5. To the right and left of the disk 10 which is provided with the running disk flanges 13 there are brackets 14 which are connected to the banner rod 5 using screws 15 which extend through holes 16 in the banner rod 5. Between these brackets 14 the disk 10 is pivotally held as a wheel.",
        "The end of the banner rod which is shown in FIG. 4 is the end \u201cwithout weight\u201d, conversely the end shown in FIG. 5 is the end of the banner rod \u201cwith weight\u201d 19 which on the outer end of the banner rod 5, therefore outside the disk 10, is attached by a screw 17 to the banner rod 5. The weight 19 and the dive hose 18 which is likewise attached with a screw 17 to the banner rod 5 result in that the banner rod 5 and thus the banner 1 assume an essentially vertical position when being towed by an aircraft 2 during flight since the end of the banner rod 5 with the weight 19 and the dive hose 18 points down.",
        "In summary one embodiment of the invention can be described as follows:",
        "A banner 1 which is to be towed via a tow rope 3 by an aircraft 2 has a banner rod 5 which is connected to the tow rope 3 via a banner spider 4. On either side of the banner 1 on the banner rod 5 disks 10 which are used as running wheels are pivotally mounted. In this way the banner rod 5 before take-off is kept at a distance from the surface of the runway 6 so that under the action of the \u201cwind\u201d generated by the propeller of the aircraft 2 the banner 1 does not rest on the runway 6, therefore the aircraft 2 can take off easily with the banner 1 attached."
