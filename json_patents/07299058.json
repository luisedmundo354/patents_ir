        "The present application claims priority from Japanese application JP2004-278656 filed on Sep. 27, 2004, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a position calculation method. More particularly, it relates to a method for calculating position of a radio device on the basis of distance-ranging results using electromagnetic waves.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "For example, according to Atushi Tuchiya and Hiromichi Tuji, \u201cFoundation of GPS Measurement\u201d, Japan Measurement Association, 1995, a GPS receiver receives signals from a plurality of GPS satellites. Moreover, these respective reception signals allow position of the GPS receiver to be detected.",
        "Also, according to JP-A-2004-101254, a plurality of radio base stations receive signals from a radio terminal. Moreover, these respective reception signals allow position of the radio terminal to be detected.",
        "In both of the above-described technologies, as illustrated in FIG. 1, based on measurements of reception timings of radio signals between each of a plurality of radio devices (hereinafter, referred to as \u201creference stations\u201d) 101, 102, . . . , 10n whose positions Pi (i=1, 2, . . . , n) have been already known and a radio device (hereinafter, referred to as \u201ca detection-target station\u201d) 100 whose position P has been unknown, distances between each of the reference stations and the detection-target station are measured, letting the distances be Ri (i=1, 2, . . . , n) respectively. Furthermore, the position P is calculated based on the above-described Ri (i=1, 2, . . . , n) and Pi (i=1, 2, . . . , n).",
        "Between the above-described two technologies, there exists a difference that the sides for measuring the reception timings differ from each other. In principle, however, the position P is acquired as the solution of the following simultaneous equations, which are designated as Expression 1.\n\n{Ri+cT\u2212\u2225Pi\u2212P\u2225}=0, i=1, . . . , n\u2003\u2003Expression 1",
        "In Expression 1, ||x|| denotes magnitude of a vector x, c denotes speed of the radio waves, and T denotes offset of a clock selected as the reference when the distances Ri (i=1, 2, . . . , n) are measured.",
        "In Expression 1, the unknowns are P and T. In addition, the above-described solution can be acquired in the case where n\u22673 if P is a point on a two-dimensional space, and in the case where of n\u22674 if P is a point on a three-dimensional space. By the way, when operating the radio position detection systems like this in environments such as indoors where reflections of the radio signals can happen easily, waveform distortions in the radio signals are likely to occur because of multiple signal reflections. On account of this, the measurements of the respective reception timings of the radio signals, i.e., the measurements of the distances between each of the reference stations and the detection-target station, turn out to contain large quantities of offsets. As a result, offset in the position calculation result P increases in quantity.",
        "Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to reduce the offset in the calculation position of the detection-target station in the multipath environment by predicting the offsets contained in the measurements of the distances between each of the reference stations and the detection-target station.",
        "In order to accomplish the above-described object, a position calculation method according to the present invention includes the following steps: Calculating error degradation quantities about the respective measurement results on the distances between the respective reference stations and the detection-target station (hereinafter, referred to as \u201cdistance-ranging results\u201d) from the respective distance-ranging results and the positions of the respective reference stations, evaluating the respective distance-ranging results based on the respective error degradation quantities, and determining weight-assigning factors about the respective distance-ranging results, checking the number of valid distance-ranging results, and calculating the position of the detection-target station based on the respective distance-ranging results, the positions of the respective reference stations, and the respective weight-assigning factors.",
        "According to the present invention, the offsets are predicted which are contained in the measurements of the distances between the respective reference stations and the detection-target station, thereby controlling influences which the offsets exert on the position calculation. This makes it possible to reduce the offset contained in the position calculation result.",
        "Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description of the embodiments of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",
        "FIG. 1 is the configuration diagram of the position detection system which becomes the background art;",
        "FIG. 2 is a flow diagram for illustrating a first embodiment of the position calculation according to the present invention;",
        "FIG. 3 is a flow diagram for illustrating steps of evaluation of distance-ranging results and updating of weight-assigning factors in the position calculation according to the present invention;",
        "FIG. 4 is a flow diagram for illustrating checking of the number of valid distance-ranging results;",

        "FIG. 6 is a configuration diagram of the position detection system relating to the present invention; and",
        "FIG. 7 is another configuration diagram of the position detection system relating to the present invention.",
        "First, assume that Expression 1 is overdetermined simultaneous equations (i.e., simultaneous equations where the number of the equations is larger than the number of unknowns). Namely, assume that n\u22674 holds if P is a point on a two-dimensional space, and that n\u22675 holds if P is a point on a three-dimensional space.",
        "Next, quoting the notations in FIG. 1 and Expression 1 and referring to FIG. 2, the explanation will be given below concerning an embodiment of the position calculation method according to the present invention.",
        "In FIG. 2, S11 is a step of calculating a reference error E0 based on the respective distance-ranging results and the positions of the respective reference stations. At the present step, as indicated in the following Expression 2, the above-described reference error E0 is given as the minimum value of an error function E (P, T) with P and T selected as the variables, or an approximate value of the minimum value.",
