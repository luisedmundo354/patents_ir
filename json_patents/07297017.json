    "abstract": "A method is used for safely removing a first device from a second device, e.g., removing a first connector from a matching second connector or removing an interface converter from a mother board of a computer. Thus, the loop of the soft strap mounted on the first device allows passage of a user's one finger, so that the user's one finger directly exerts a straight outward force on the loop of the soft strap to easily remove the first device from the second device in a straight manner without producing deflection, thereby removing the first device from the second device easily and safely without damaging the first device or the second device during the pulling process.",
