        "1. Technical Field",
        "This disclosure relates to a semiconductor device and a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device. More particularly, this disclosure relates to a semiconductor device having a switching function and a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "FIGS. 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 are plan views illustrating a conventional method of manufacturing a transistor. FIGS. 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 are cross-sectional views taken along I-I\u2032 lines in FIGS. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, respectively.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1, dummy regions 11 and active regions 12 are formed at an upper portion of a semiconductor substrate 10. The dummy regions 11 are arranged in a first direction. However, the dummy regions 11 are not connected to one another in the first direction.",
        "Thereafter, a silicon oxide layer (not shown) is formed on the semiconductor substrate 10 to cover the dummy regions 11 and the active regions 12. A planarization process is then performed on the silicon oxide layer until the dummy regions 11 and the active regions 12 are exposed. Thus, an isolation layer pattern 30 is formed.",
        "The dummy regions 11 may prevent the active regions 12 from easily leaning while the planarization process is performed. However, when the sizes of the dummy regions 11 are relatively small, the dummy regions 11 as well as the active regions 12 may lean while the planarization process is performed.",
        "The isolation layer pattern 30 extends in a second direction substantially perpendicular to the first direction between the dummy regions 11. Thus, the dummy regions 11 are electrically insulated from one another by the isolation layer pattern 30.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, a mask structure 40 is formed on the dummy regions 11, the active regions 12 and the isolation layer pattern 30. The mask structure 40 has first openings 5c partially exposing the dummy regions 11, the active regions 12 and the isolation layer pattern 30. The first openings 5c and the mask structure 40 extend in the second direction. The mask structure 40 includes silicon nitride layer patterns 42 and buffer layer patterns 41. The nitride layer patterns 42 are formed on each of the buffer layer patterns 41.",
        "Thereafter, the dummy regions 11 and the active regions 12 are etched using the mask structure 40 as an etch mask. Thus, first grooves 1c and second grooves (not shown) are formed at upper portions of the dummy regions 11 and upper portions of the active regions 12, respectively. Because the first openings 5c extend in the second direction, the first grooves 1c and the second grooves also extend in the second direction.",
        "As described above, the isolation layer pattern 30 exists between the dummy regions 11. The isolation layer pattern 30 may be minimally etched while the dummy regions 11 and the active regions 12 are etched to form the first grooves 1c and the second grooves. Thus, the sections of the first grooves 1c taken along the line I-I\u2032 are substantially asymmetric.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, a silicon oxide layer 50 having a substantially uniform thickness is formed on the mask structure 40, the dummy regions 11, the active regions 12 and the isolation layer pattern 30. Thus, inner faces of the first grooves 1c and the second grooves are covered with the silicon oxide layer 50. Here, the silicon oxide layer 50 may conform to the first grooves 1c and the second grooves.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 6 and 7, an anisotropic etching process is performed on the silicon oxide layer 50 so that portions of the silicon oxide layer 50, the portions being located on bottom faces of the first grooves 1c, bottom faces of the second grooves, the mask structure 40 and the isolation layer pattern 30, may be selectively removed. Thus, silicon oxide layer patterns 51 are formed on sidewalls of the first grooves 1c and the second grooves.",
        "Thereafter, portions of the dummy regions 11 and portions of the active regions 12 that are exposed through the first grooves 1c and the second grooves, respectively, are isotropically etched using the mask structure 40 and the silicon oxide layer patterns 51 together as an etch mask. Thus, third grooves 3c communicated with the first grooves 1c are formed under the first grooves 1c. The third grooves 3c extend in the second direction. In addition, fourth grooves (not shown) communicated with the second grooves are formed under the second grooves. The fourth grooves also extend in the second direction.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 7, the isolation layer pattern 30 is formed between the dummy regions 11. Thus, the sections of the third grooves 3c taken along the first direction are not substantially circular shapes even though the third grooves 3c are formed by an isotropic etching process. That is, the sections of the third grooves 3c taken along the first direction are substantially asymmetric.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 8 and 9, the mask structure 40 and the silicon oxide layer patterns 51 are removed. Thereafter, a gate oxide layer 60 including silicon oxide is formed on faces of the active regions 12 and the dummy regions 11, the faces being exposed by the isolation layer pattern 30. The gate oxide layer 60 has a substantially uniform thickness. Thus, inner faces of the first grooves 1c, the second grooves, the third grooves 3c and the fourth grooves are covered with the gate oxide layer 60.",
        "Thereafter, a gate electrode layer 70 including a first portion 70a and second portions 70b is formed on the gate oxide layer 60 and the isolation layer pattern 30. The first portion 70a fills the first grooves 1c and the second grooves that have been partially filled with the gate oxide layer 60. The second portions 70b fill the third grooves 3c and fourth grooves that have been partially filled with the gate oxide layer 60. The second portions 70b have voids 5d.",
        "As described above, the sections of the third grooves 3c taken along the first direction are not substantially circular shapes. Thus, the voids 5d generated in the second portions 70b while the gate electrode layer 70 fills up the third grooves 3c may easily migrate from the centers of the second portions 70b. That is, a void migration may be generated so that failure of a semiconductor device may occur.",
        "Gate mask layer patterns 80 are formed on the gate electrode layer 70. Second openings 6c are defined between the gate mask layer patterns 80. The gate electrode layer 70 is partially exposed through the second openings 6c. The second openings 6c and the gate mask layer patterns 80 extend in the second direction. Here, the gate mask layer patterns 80 correspond to word lines.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 10 and 11, the gate electrode layer 70 and the gate oxide layers 60 are subsequently etched using the gate mask layer patterns 80 as an etch mask. Thus, gate electrodes 71 and gate oxide layer patterns 61 are formed.",
        "Two gate electrodes 71 are formed on each of the active regions 12. In addition, as illustrated in FIG. 11, two gate electrodes 71 are also formed on each of the dummy patterns 11. This is because the dummy regions 11 are separated from one another.",
        "Dummy impurity regions 13 and active impurity regions 14 are formed at upper face portions of the dummy regions 11 and upper face portions of the active regions 12, respectively, by using the gate mask layer patterns 80 and the isolation layer pattern 30 together as an ion implantation mask.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 12 and 13, an insulating layer (not shown) is formed to cover the dummy impurity regions 13, the active impurity regions 14, the isolation layer pattern 30, the gate oxide layer patterns 61, the gate electrodes 71 and the gate mask layer patterns 80.",
        "Thereafter, the insulating layer is anisotropically etched to form spacers 90 on sidewalls of the gate mask layer patterns 80, the gate electrodes 71 and the gate oxide layer patterns 61. Thus, a semiconductor device including the dummy impurity regions 13, the active impurity regions 14, the gate oxide layer patterns 61, the gate electrodes 71, the gate mask layer patterns 80 and the spacers 90 may be fabricated.",
        "As described above, the dummy regions 11 are spaced apart from one another in the first direction. Thus, if the dummy regions 11 are relatively small, the dummy regions 11 may lean or collapse.",
        "In addition, because the isolation layer pattern 30 is formed between the dummy regions 11, the sections of the third grooves 3c taken in the first direction may not be substantially circular shapes even though the third grooves 3c are formed by the isotropic etching process. That is, the sections of the third grooves 3c taken in the first direction may be substantially asymmetric.",
        "Thus, the voids 5d generated in the second portions 70b may easily migrate from the centers of the second portions 70b while the gate electrode layer 70 fills the third grooves 3c. As a result, the voids 5d may cause the failure of a semiconductor device.",
        "A method of fabricating a semiconductor device includes forming an isolation layer pattern over a dummy region extending in a first direction, forming grooves in a second direction perpendicular to the first direction, forming gate oxide layers on the dummy region and active regions, forming gate electrodes in the grooves having a void, forming gate electrodes and gate oxide layers, and doping impurities into the dummy and active regions exposed by the gate electrode and oxide layers.",

        "Referring to FIGS. 14 to 16, a semiconductor device includes a dummy region 110, active regions 120, an isolation layer pattern 300, gate electrodes 10, gate oxide layer patterns 610, gate mask layer patterns 800 and spacers 900.",
        "The dummy region 110 extends in a first direction. First grooves 10c and third grooves 30c are formed at an upper portion of the dummy region 110. The first grooves 10c and the third grooves 30c extend in a second direction substantially perpendicular to the first direction. The third grooves 30c are provided under the first grooves 10c such that the third grooves 30c are communicated with the first grooves 10c. The first grooves 10c and the third grooves 30c may be formed by an anisotropic etching process and an isotropic etching process, respectively. Dummy impurity regions 130 are formed at an upper face portion of the dummy region 110.",
        "Second grooves 20c and fourth grooves 40c are formed at upper portions of the active regions 120. The second grooves 20c and the fourth grooves 40c extend in the second direction. The fourth grooves 40c are provided under the second grooves 20c such that the fourth grooves 20c are communicated with the second grooves 20c. The second grooves 20c and the fourth grooves 40c are formed by the anisotropic etching process and the isotropic etching process, respectively. Active impurity regions 140 are formed at upper face portions of the active regions 120.",
        "Because the first grooves 10c and the second grooves 20c are formed by the anisotropic etching process, sidewalls of the first grooves 10c and the second grooves 20c are substantially vertical.",
        "On the other hand, because the third grooves 30c and the fourth grooves 40c are formed by the isotropic etching process, sections of the third grooves 30c and the fourth grooves 40c taken along the first direction are substantially circular shapes.",
        "Here, the sections may be varied depending on conditions of the isotropic etching process. For example, the sections may be substantially oval shaped or substantially semicircular shaped.",
        "The isolation layer pattern 300 is provided between the dummy region 110 and the active regions 120 and between the active regions 120. Thus, the isolation layer pattern 300 insulates the dummy region 110 from the active regions 120 electrically. In addition, the isolation layer insulates the active regions 120 from one another electrically.",
        "Here, the isolation layer pattern 300 may not cut the dummy region 110 in the second direction. Thus, the dummy region 110 may extend in the first direction.",
        "The gate electrode 710 includes a first portion 710a and a second portion 710b. The first portion 710a extends in the second direction on the isolation layer pattern 300 such that the first portion 710a fills the first grooves 10c and the second grooves 20c. The second portions 710b are connected to the first portion 710a. The second portions 710b fill the third grooves 30c and the fourth grooves 40c. Each of the second portions 710b has a void 50d.",
        "As described above, because the isolation layer pattern 300 does not cut the dummy region 110 in the second direction, the third and fourth grooves 30c and 40c are substantially symmetrical. Thus, the voids 50d may be generated at the centers of the second portions 710b.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 16, two gate electrodes 710 are formed on each of the active regions 120. On the other hand, as illustrated in FIG. 15, at least three gate electrodes 710 are formed on the dummy region 110. This is because the dummy region 110 extends in the first direction.",
        "The gate oxide layer patterns 610 are formed between the gate electrodes 710 and the dummy region 110 and between the gate electrodes 710 and the active regions 120.",
        "The gate mask layer patterns 800 are formed on each of the gate electrodes 710. The spacers 900 are formed on sidewalls of the gate oxide layer patterns 610, the gate electrodes 710 and the gate mask layer patterns 800.",
        "Hereinafter, methods of manufacturing the semiconductor devices in FIGS. 14 to 16 will be described.",
        "FIGS. 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32 and 35 are plan views illustrating the methods of manufacturing the semiconductor devices in FIGS. 14 to 16. FIGS. 21, 24, 27, 30, 33 and 36 are cross-sectional views taken along the I-I\u2032 line in FIGS. 20, 23, 26, 29, 32 and 35, respectively. FIGS. 22, 25, 28, 31, 34 and 37 are cross-sectional views taken along the II-II\u2032 line in FIGS. 20, 23, 26, 29, 32 and 35, respectively.",
        "Referring to FIG. 17, a hard mask layer pattern 200 is formed on a semiconductor substrate 100. The hard mask layer pattern 200 partially exposes the semiconductor substrate 100. The hard mask layer pattern 200 includes a first portion 200a and second portions 200b. A dummy region 110 (see FIG. 15) is to be formed under the first portion 200a. Active regions 120 (see FIG. 15) are to be formed under the second portions 200b. The dummy region 110 extends in a first direction in which the I-I\u2032 line extends.",
        "Referring to FIG. 18, the semiconductor substrate 100 is etched using the hard mask layer pattern 200 as an etch mask. The hard mask layer pattern 200 is then removed. Thus, the dummy region 110 and the active regions 120 are formed at an upper portion of the semiconductor substrate 100. Because the dummy region 110 is formed under the first portion 200a extending in the first direction, the dummy region 110 also extends in the first direction.",
        "Referring to FIG. 19, a silicon oxide layer (not shown) is formed on the semiconductor substrate 100 to cover the dummy region 110 and the active regions 120. Thereafter, a planarization process is performed until the dummy region 110 and the active regions 120 are exposed so that an isolation layer pattern 300 may be formed.",
        "The dummy region 110 may prevent the active regions 120 from leaning while the planarization process is performed. Because the dummy region 110 extends in the first direction, the dummy region 110 may not lean while the planarization process is performed.",
        "Here, the isolation layer pattern 300 corresponds to a field region. Because the dummy region 110 extends in the first direction, the dummy region 110 is not cut by the isolation layer pattern 300.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 20 to 22, a mask structure 400 is formed on the dummy region 110, the active regions 120 and the isolation layer pattern 300. The mask structure 400 has first openings 50c partially exposing the dummy region 110, the active regions 120 and the isolation layer pattern 300. The first openings 50c and the mask structure 400 extend in a second direction substantially perpendicular to the first direction. The mask structure 400 includes silicon nitride layer patterns 420 and buffer layer patterns 410. The silicon nitride layer patterns 420 are formed on each of the buffer layer patterns 410. The buffer layer patterns 410 may include silicon oxide.",
        "Thereafter, the dummy region 110 and the active regions 120 are etched using the mask structure 400 as an etch mask. Thus, first grooves 10c and second grooves 20c are formed at an upper portion of the dummy regions 110 and upper portions of the active regions 120, respectively. Because the first openings 50c extend in the second direction, the first grooves 10c and the second grooves 20c also extend in the second direction.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 23 to 25, a silicon oxide layer 500 having a substantially uniform thickness is formed on the mask structure 400, the dummy region 110, the active regions 120 and the isolation layer pattern 300. Thus, inner faces of the first grooves 10c and the second grooves 20c are covered with the silicon oxide layer 500. Here, the silicon oxide layer 500 may conform to the first grooves 10c and the second grooves 20c. For example, the silicon oxide layer 500 may be formed by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 26 to 28, portions of the silicon oxide layer 500 located on bottom faces of the first grooves 10c, bottom faces of the second grooves 20c and the mask structure 400 are selectively removed. Thus, silicon oxide layer patterns 510 are formed on sidewalls of the first grooves 10c and the second grooves 20c.",
        "Thereafter, portions of the dummy region 110 and portions of the active regions 120 that are exposed through the first grooves 10c and the second grooves 20c, respectively, are isotropically etched using the mask structure 400 and the silicon oxide layer patterns 510 together as an etch mask. Thus, third grooves 30c communicated with the first grooves 10c may be formed under the first grooves 10c. Here, the third grooves 30c may extend in the second direction. In addition, fourth grooves 40c communicated with the second grooves 20c are formed under the second grooves 20c. The fourth grooves 40c extend in the second direction.",
        "Because the third grooves 30c and the fourth grooves 40c are formed by an isotropic etching process, sections of the third grooves 30c and the fourth grooves 40c taken along the first direction are substantially circular shapes. Here, the sections may be varied depending on conditions of the isotropic etching process. As one example, the sections may be substantially oval shapes. As another example, the sections may be substantially semicircular shapes.",
        "As described above, the sections of the fourth grooves 40c taken along the first direction are substantially circular shapes. Thus, channel regions may be enlarged. As illustrated in FIG. 27, the dummy region 110 may not be cut in the second direction by the isolation layer pattern 300. Thus, the isolation layer pattern 300 may not exist between the third grooves 30c formed at the dummy region 110. As a result, the sections of the third grooves 30c taken along the first direction are substantially symmetrical.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 29 to 31, the mask structure 400 and the silicon oxide layer patterns 510 are removed. Thereafter, gate oxide layers 600 including silicon oxide are formed on faces of the active regions 120 and the dummy region 110, the faces being exposed by the isolation layer pattern 300. The gate oxide layers 600 have substantially uniform thicknesses. Thus, inner faces of the first, second, third and fourth grooves 10c, 20c, 30c and 40c are covered with the gate oxide layers 600. The gate oxide layers 600 are formed by a thermal oxidation process.",
        "The isolation layer pattern 300 defines the first, second, third and fourth grooves 10c, 20c, 30c and 40c in the second direction. Thus, if the gate oxide layers 600 are formed by the thermal oxidation process, the gate oxide layers 600 may not be formed on portions of the isolation layer pattern 300, the portions defining the first, second, third and fourth grooves 10c, 20c, 30c and 40c in the second direction.",
        "Thereafter, a gate electrode layer 700 is formed on the gate oxide layers 600 and the isolation layer pattern 300. The gate electrode layer 700 includes a first portion 700a and second portions 700b. The first portion 700a fills up the first and second grooves 10c and 20c partially filled with the gate oxide layers 600. The second portions 700b fill up the third and fourth grooves 30c and 40c partially filled with the gate oxide layers 600. Each of the second portions 700b has a void 50d. The gate electrode layer 700 may include conductive material such as metal or polysilicon doped with impurities.",
        "As described above, the sections of the third and fourth grooves 20 and 40 taken along the first direction are substantially circular shapes. Thus, voids 50d are generated in the second portions 700b when the gate electrode layer 700 fills the third and fourth grooves 30c and 40c.",
        "As already illustrated in FIG. 27, the sections of the third and fourth grooves 30c and 40c taken along the first direction are substantially symmetrical. Thus, the voids 50d may be formed at the centers of the second portions 700b. That is, the voids 50d may not migrate from the centers of the second portions 700b.",
        "Thereafter, gate mask layer patterns 800 are formed on the gate electrode layer 700. Second openings 60c are defined between the gate mask layer patterns 800. The gate electrode layer 700 is partially exposed through the second openings 60c. The second openings 60c and the gate mask layer patterns 800 extend in the second direction. Here, the gate mask layer patterns 800 correspond to word lines. Thus, the word lines extend in the second direction.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 32 to 34, the gate electrode layer 700 and the gate oxide layers 600 are subsequently etched using the gate mask layer patterns 800 as an etch mask. Thus, gate electrodes 710 and gate oxide layer patterns 610 are formed.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 34, two gate electrodes 710 are formed on each of the active regions 120. However, as illustrated in FIG. 33, at least three gate electrodes 710 are formed on the dummy region 110. This is because the dummy region 110 extends in the first direction.",
        "An ion implantation process is performed using the gate mask layer patterns 800 and the isolation layer pattern 300 together as an ion implantation mask so that dummy impurity regions 130 and active impurity regions 140 are formed at an upper face portion of the dummy region 110 and upper face portions of the active regions 120, respectively.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 35 to 37, an insulating layer (not shown) is formed to cover the dummy impurity regions 130, the active impurity regions 140, the isolation layer pattern 300, the gate oxide layer patterns 610, the gate electrodes 710 and the gate mask layer patterns 800. The insulating layer may include insulating material such as silicon nitride.",
        "Thereafter, the insulating layer is anisotropically etched so that spacers 900 are formed on sidewalls of the gate mask layer patterns 800, the gate electrodes 710 and the gate oxide layer patterns 610. Thus, the semiconductor device including the dummy impurity regions 130, the active impurity regions 140, the gate oxide layer patterns 610, the gate electrodes 710, the gate mask layer patterns 800 and the spacers 900 may be fabricated.",
        "According to the invention, a dummy region extends in a direction substantially perpendicular to a word line. Thus, leaning of the dummy region may be prevented.",
        "In addition, the dummy region is not cut by an isolation layer pattern. Thus, a failure due to a migration of a void generated in a lower portion of a gate electrode, the lower portion being lodged into the dummy region, may be prevented.",
        "The invention may be practiced in many ways. What follows are exemplary, non-limiting descriptions of some embodiments of the invention.",

The second portions are connected to the first portion. The second portions fill the third and fourth grooves. The second portion has a void.
