        "This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/592,531, filed Jul. 29, 2004, which disclosure is incorporated reference in its entirety for all purposes.",
        "The present invention generally relates to techniques for manufacturing hard disk drives. More particularly, the invention provides a method and system for repairing a magnetic head slider for a head gimbal assembly using an ultrasonic source. Other sources may also be used.",
        "A hard disk drive (HDD) for data storage adapts a magnetoresistive thin film element (MR Head) to perform data read/write operations. The MR Head is bonded onto a flexure gimbal and then connected to a flex circuit using solder or gold ball bonding for data transmission. A suspension provides a platform for this architecture forming a Head Gimbal Assembly, HGA, as shown in FIG. 4.",
        "During the manufacture of an HGA, if it is determined that the electrical property of the magnetic head slider is unacceptable, it is desirable to remove the magnetic head slider and salvage the suspension to minimize material loss. As the areal density of a hard disk drive increases, the magnetic head slider is also reduced in its size from nano- (50%), to pico- (30%), and to femto- (20%) scale dimensions, the detaching process of magnetic head slider becomes an increasingly difficult challenge. In a prior art technique, mechanical cutting using a cutter blade was suggested if gold ball bonding was used. For solder ball bonding, the detachment may employ the use of heat to melt the solder and removal by vacuum suction. As the size of the magnetic head slider gets smaller and the gimbal stiffness continues to decrease, there is a need for less contact and less intrusive techniques to detach a magnetic head slider.",
        "From the above, it is seen that an improved technique for manufacturing a hard disk drive is highly desirable.",
        "A method for reworking a head gimbal assembly (HGA) according to the present invention includes positioning a probe in contact with or near to a slider component that is connected to a gimbal. An ultrasonic excitation is applied to the probe to create a reciprocating action. The reciprocating action creates mechanical stress in the connection between the slider and the gimbal to which the slider is mechanically mounted. The slider is thereby detached from the HGA.",
        "Various additional objects, features and advantages of the present invention can be more fully appreciated with reference to the detailed description and accompanying drawing, wherein:",
        "FIGS. 1A-1C show a simplified illustration of a method for detaching a magnetic head slider according to an embodiment of the present invention;",
        "FIGS. 2A-2C show a simplified illustration of a method for detaching a magnetic head slider according to another embodiment of the present invention;",
        "FIGS. 3A-3D show a simplified illustration of a method for detaching a magnetic head slider according to still another embodiment of the present invention; and",
        "FIG. 4 is a simplified cross-sectional view of a Head Gimbal Assembly (HGA).",
        "With reference to FIGS. 1A-1C, a specific embodiment of the present invention illustrates a method for reworking a head gimbal assembly for disk drive applications. The method includes holding (e.g., via a support member) a head gimbal assembly (HGA) 100 comprising a magnetic head slider 112, which is physically attached to a portion of the head gimbal assembly 100. Preferably, the magnetic head slider 112 is maintained on the support member by an adhesive material 114. A gold, or solder, ball bond 116 provides an electrical connection to a gimbal 102. Thus, in FIG. 1A, the method according to the specific embodiment of the present invention includes contacting a probe member 202 coupled to an ultrasonic transducer unit 200 to a portion of the magnetic head slider 112.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1B, the method applies a predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer 200 to the probe member 202 such that the probe member 202 oscillates at a frequency greater than about 1 k Hz in a linear motion having a spatial displacement of less than 0.03 mm as the probe member 202 is in contact within a vicinity of the portion of the magnetic head slider 100. The method includes causing a repetitive pushing action upon the magnetic head slider 112 using the oscillation of the probe member 202 while applying the predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer 200 to the probe member 202.",
        "Referring for a moment to FIG. 4, the probe member 202 can be arranged in a parallel relation to the trace interconnect to which the magnetic head slider 112 is in electrical contact. Since the magnetic head slider 112 is typically mounted in a substantially parallel relation to the trace interconnect, the pushing action of the probe member 202 is maximally delivered to overcome the adhesion force of the adhesive 114.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1C, the pushing action will cause separation of the magnetic head slider 112 from the head gimbal assembly 100. The method includes removing the predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer 200.",
        "In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the probe member 202 is maintained at a temperature ranging from about 20\u00b0 C. to about 60\u00b0 C. during the operation.",
        "The detachment employs high frequency ultrasonic transducer 200 providing linear motion with a spatial displacement in the order of less than 30 micrometers. By bringing the probe member 202 of the transducer 200 to come into contact or near contact (see FIGS. 3A-3D) with the magnetic head slider 112, the probe can move the magnetic head slider in a back and forth motion with a small displacement at a high frequency in the order of thousands of times per second. This small movement at high frequency creates a significant strain energy which can break away the ball bond 116 and the adhesive 114 underneath.",
        "With reference to FIGS. 2A-2C, another specific embodiment of the present invention is shown of a method for reworking a head gimbal assembly for disk drive applications. The method includes a support member 300 schematically represented in the figure as an object that resembles a clamp, but which will be understood to represent any suitable support/holding structure for performing the described operation. The support member 300 supports the head gimbal assembly (HGA) 100. As shown in FIGS. 1A-1C, the HGA 100 includes the magnetic head slider 112 which is physically attached to a portion of the head gimbal assembly via the adhesive 114. Preferably, the magnetic head slider 112 is also supported on the support member 300. The method includes contacting the probe member 202 of the ultrasonic transducer 200 to a portion of the magnetic head slider 112.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2B, the method applies a predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer 200 to the probe member 202 such that the probe member oscillates at a frequency greater than a predetermined frequency. The range of motion of oscillation of the probe member 202 has a spatial displacement of less than a predetermined distance as the probe member is in contact within a vicinity of the portion of the magnetic head slider 112 that is being supported via the support member 300.",
        "As can be seen in FIG. 2C, the method includes a repetitive pushing action against the magnetic head slider 112 using the oscillation of the probe member 202 while applying the predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer 200 to the probe member. The repeated pushing action overcomes the adhesion force of the adhesive 114 and causes separation of the magnetic head slider 112 from the head gimbal assembly 100. The method includes removing the predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer.",
        "With reference to FIGS. 3A-3D, yet another specific embodiment of the present invention is shown of a method for reworking a head gimbal assembly for disk drive applications. The method includes holding (e.g., via a support member such as illustrated in FIGS. 2A-2C) the HGA 100. As shown in FIGS. 1A-1C and in FIGS. 2A-2C, the HGA 100 includes the magnetic head slider 112 which is physically attached to a portion of the head gimbal assembly via the adhesive 114. As shown in FIG. 3A, the method includes contacting the probe member 202 of the ultrasonic transducer 200 to a portion of the magnetic head slider 112. Alternatively, the probe member 202 can be brought near to the slider 112. This arrangement is shown in FIG. 3B.",
        "In FIG. 3C, the method applies a predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer 200 to the probe member 202 such that the probe member oscillates at a frequency greater than a predetermined frequency. The range of motion of oscillation of the probe member 202 has a spatial displacement of less than a predetermined distance so that the probe member 202 alternates between contacting and not-contacting the magnetic head slider 112 as the probe member reciprocates back and forth against the magnetic head slider.",
        "As can be seen in FIG. 3C, the oscillations cause repetitive pushing action against the magnetic head slider 112 using the oscillation of the probe member 202 while applying the predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer 200 to the probe member. The repeated pushing action overcomes the adhesion force of the adhesive 114 and causes separation of the magnetic head slider 112 from the head gimbal assembly 100. The method includes removing the predetermined power from the ultrasonic transducer.",
        "It is also understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and scope of the appended claims."
