    "abstract": "A method of operating an RF communicator adapted for an automatic meter reading (AMR) system includes maintaining the communicator in a low-power standby mode and automatically responding to bubble-up events that are spaced apart by time durations. The step of responding includes initiating the RF communicator to exit the standby mode and enter into an active operating mode, and thereafter return to the standby mode. A time duration between successive bubble-up events is automatically adjusted. One method of automatically adjusting a bubble up rate includes automatically setting the bubble-up rate to a relatively higher rate during a time of relatively high expectation of an occurrence of a communication attempt, and automatically setting the bubble-up rate to a relatively lower rate during a time of relatively low expectation of an occurrence of a communication attempt.",

        "The invention relates to communications systems and, more particularly, to a communications system utilizing an adaptive energy management scheme.",
        "Current automatic meter reading (AMR) systems include, as one of the major components of the system, a large number of endpoints, each endpoint being comprised of an ERT\u00ae (encoder, receiver, transmitter) that is interfaced to a utility meter. In a typical system, the ERT\u00ae obtains a consumption reading from the utility meter, such as consumption of water, gas, or electricity. A conventional endpoint which includes a communicator, such as a radio transceiver, transmits the consumption information to an intermediate receiver device according to the AMR system paradigm. In some endpoint applications, battery power is preferred. For example, gas or water meters that are battery-powered do not need to be connected to, and reliant upon, line power. Even electricity consumption meters, which are by their nature connected to the line power, can benefit from an independent power source. An independently-powered endpoint can inform the central utility about any occurrence of power outage or unauthorized tampering.",
        "Battery-powered endpoints have been designed to limit the power consumed in day-to-day operation. One well-known design feature is a bubble-up mode of operation, in which an endpoint \u201cbubbles-up,\u201d or activates its transceiver to communicate or attempt to communicate with the AMR data collection system, according to a preset schedule. The time duration or period between bubble-up events may typically span seconds or minutes.",
        "Some AMR systems have a fixed, or installed, meter reading infrastructure that listens for transmissions from utility meter endpoints occurring on a bubble-up basis. In other systems, a typical endpoint bubbles up at a pre-set time to activate its receiver circuitry, which becomes receptive to a signal from an intermediate receiver or the like that prompts the endpoint to send the consumption reading to the reader or receiver. Some AMR systems utilize portable or vehicle-mounted reading devices that are transported along a meter reading route by utility personnel. A meter reading route is generally planned to pass within communications proximity to the utility meters to be read. Some AMR systems use a combination of fixed and mobile meter reading devices where, for example, the fixed devices communicate with endpoints at regular scheduled intervals, and the mobile devices communicate with selected endpoints on an as-needed basis.",
        "Utility meters are generally read on periodic intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc. The meter reads may occur at regularly spaced, pre-determined times in each period such as, for example, on the first day of each month. A challenge for systems designers is accommodating a common practice among utilities to vary the meter reading frequency of each occurrence. Variations may be due to factors such as scheduling changes, migration to different AMR systems, work backlogs, downtime, and the like. For example, a utility may ordinarily request information from a given meter on a semi-monthly basis during one portion of the year, and on a weekly basis during another portion of the year. It is also common practice among utilities to take readings from utility meters, and return to a particular area shortly thereafter to request additional data or repeated data from certain utility meters. Therefore, actual communication between meter and reader does not necessarily take place on a consistent schedule.",
        "A short bubble up cycle (a high bubble-up frequency) can improve system performance by creating a greater likelihood of achieving communications between a utility meter endpoint and a receiver (or reader). In a situation in which a mobile reader follows a route that passes near a given meter, there exists a narrow window of opportunity for the meter endpoint to successfully interface with the reading device during the time that the reader is within communications proximity to the meter. Therefore, one challenge associated with bubble-up operation is pre-setting a frequency for bubble-up events. System designers must trade off system communications reliability, which is improved with more frequent bubble-ups, against battery-powered endpoint energy consumption, which is improved with less frequent bubble-ups.",
        "The above summary of the invention is not intended to describe each illustrated embodiment or every implementation of the invention. The figures and the detailed description that follow more particularly exemplify these embodiments.",

In one example application, a bubble-up operating mode according to one embodiment of the invention is implemented in utility meter endpoint devices that are a part of an AMR system. While the invention is not necessarily limited to such an application, the invention will be better appreciated using a discussion of example embodiments in such a specific context.",
        "AMR system 100, as depicted in FIG. 1, utilizes the invention which includes at least one utility measurement device including, but not limited to, electric meters 102, gas meters 104 and water meters 106. Each of the meters may be either electrically or battery powered. The system further includes at least one endpoint (or ERT\u00ae) 108, wherein each corresponds and interfaces to a meter. Each of the endpoints (or ERT\u00ae) 108 preferably incorporates a radio frequency (RF) device, e.g., the Itron, Inc. ERT\u00ae. The system additionally includes one or more readers, which may be fixed or mobile, as depicted in FIG. 1 to include: (1) a mobile hand-held reader 110, such as that used in the Itron Off-site meter reading system; (2) a mobile vehicle-equipped reader 112, such as that used in the Itron Mobile AMR system; (3) a fixed radio communication network 114, such as the Itron Fixed Network AMR system that utilizes the additional components of cell central control units (CCUs) and network control nodes (NCNs); and (4) a fixed micro-network system, such as the Itron Micronetwork AMR system that utilizes both radio communication through concentrators and telephone communications through PSTN. Of course, other types of readers may be used without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Further included in AMR system 100 is a head-end, host processor 118 that incorporates software that manages the collection of metering data and facilitates the transfer of that data to a utility or supplier billing system 120.",
        "In AMR system 100, endpoints 108 can support one-way meter reading, 1.5-way meter reading, or two-way meter reading systems. A one-way meter reading system provides a reader that listens to messages sent asynchronously from each endpoint. In a one-way meter reading system, endpoints do not need to receive any information from the reader. In a 1.5-way meter reading system, the reader sends prompting signals to endpoints, which, in turn, listen for, and respond to the prompting signals by simply transmitting their messages. In a two-way meter reading system, endpoints also listen for, and respond to prompting signals issued by the reader. In addition, a two-way meter reading system enables the reader to communicate with and command the endpoint while also enabling the endpoint to respond to the reader's communications and commands.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates one embodiment of a utility meter endpoint 208. Endpoint 208 interfaces with a utility meter 210, receives consumption and other relevant data from utility meter 210, and communicates the data to AMR system 212. Endpoint 208 includes an interface system 214, which operatively couples to utility meter 210 via coupling 215. In one embodiment, coupling 215A includes electrical and mechanical components for making a physical and electrical connection between utility meter 210 and endpoint 208. For example, coupling 215A can include electrical connectors and conductors that carry electrical signals from utility meter 210 to interface hardware in interface system 214 that converts the electrical signals into a digital representation that is readable by a CPU 216. Interface system 214 is, interfaced with CPU 216 via interface 215B. In one embodiment, interface 215 includes a portion of a data bus and of an address bus.",
        "In this example embodiment, CPU 216 is a controller that oversees operation of endpoint 208. In one embodiment, CPU 216 includes a microprocessor system that has memory, instruction processing, and input/output circuits. CPU 216 interfaces with radio transceiver 218 via interface 217. In one embodiment, interface 217 includes a portion of a data bus and of an address bus, which is then coupled to an antenna 220. In operation, interface hardware 214 forwards and converts utility meter data for further processing by CPU 216. CPU 216 processes and stores the data at least temporarily, and instructs transceiver 218 to communicate the metered data to AMR system 212 at appropriate times.",
        "Endpoint 208 operates in a low-power standby mode during a majority (>50%) of the time. While in the standby mode, interface system 214, CPU 216, and transceiver 218 are effectively shut down to reduce power consumption. Timer 222 operates to periodically wake up the shut-down systems so that they enter into an active operating mode. In one embodiment, timer 222 is an independent circuit that is interfaced with CPU 216. In another embodiment, timer 222 is implemented as a watchdog timer in a microcontroller that is a part of CPU 216. In either embodiment, one feature of timer 222 is that timer 222 consumes relatively little energy for operating. Also, upon expiration of a settable time duration set into timer 222, timer 222 provides a signal that initiates bringing online the systems that are in standby mode. In a related embodiment, the settable time duration is set in timer 222 by CPU 216 via a setup signal 223. For example, setup signal 223 can be carried via a data bus.",
        "According to one example embodiment, endpoint 208 includes a power supply 224. In one embodiment, power supply 224 includes one or more batteries. Power supply 224 provides conditioned power to interface system 214, CPU 216, and transceiver 218 via a switchable power bus 225. Power supply 224 provides conditioned power to timer 222 via a power line 226. Timer 222 provides a control signal 228 to power supply 224 that causes power supply 224 to apply power to power bus 225. CPU 216 provides a control signal 230 to power supply 224 that causes power supply 224 to remove power from power bus 225. In operation, beginning in a standby mode, timer 222 has been configured with a set time duration by CPU 216 via setup signal 223. Timer 222 monitors the passing of the time duration and, at the expiration of the time duration, timer 222 provides a signal to power supply 224 to energize power bus 225. Once power is applied via power bus 225 to CPU 216, interface system 214, and transceiver 218, CPU 216 begins executing a program that gathers data from utility meter 210 via interface system 214, and momentarily activates transceiver 218. Once the data gathering program is complete, CPU 216 sets a time duration into timer 222 and initiates the clock while generating a timing, and generates a control signal 230 to power down the systems that have been powered via power bus 225.",
        "The operation cycle described above is one example of endpoint activity during a bubble-up event. In a related embodiment, during each bubble-up event, transceiver 218 transmits the utility meter data via wireless communication 221. In this embodiment, the AMR system is presumed to be in a continuous receptive state to transmissions by endpoints. In another related embodiment, during each bubble-up event, transceiver 218 enters into a receptive operating mode, and forwards received signals to CPU 216 for analysis. CPU 216 then determines whether to respond to any received signal.",
        "In one example embodiment, CPU 216 is programmed to respond to a valid pseudo-noise (PN) sequence that includes a wakeup preamble. Receipt by CPU 216 of a valid PN sequence initiates communication 221 between endpoint 208 and AMR system 212. In this example embodiment, AMR system can communicate any number of instructions, configuration changes, requests for data transmission, or the like, to endpoint 208.",
        "In one embodiment, setup signal 223, at different times, can set timer 222 with different time durations. In effect, these different time durations cause the time between bubble-up events to be different. The inverse of the time duration between bubble-up events, the inverse of the period of each bubble-up cycle, or the repetition rate (or frequency) of bubble-up events, shall be generally referred to herein as bubble-up rate.",
        "In a related embodiment, the bubble-up rate is set and varied by CPU 216. Varying the bubble-up rate can be advantageous in certain applications. One such application, in which varying the bubble-up rate is useful for extending battery life without substantially compromising communications performance, is described below. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that there may be other applications in which automatically varying the time between bubble-up events is useful.",
        "In one application, a battery-powered endpoint, such as utility meter endpoint 208, utilizes a variable bubble-up rate for communicating with a fixed AMR system that generally initiates communication with endpoints according to scheduled communication times. For example, scheduled communication times can be maintained according to a policy instituted by the utility provider in which each endpoint is read every fourteen (14) days. In a more flexible example communication policy, during each communication the AMR system informs each endpoint of the date/time of, or the time interval until, the next communication attempt. In this example application, it is desirable to conserve battery energy between communication attempts. To this end, in one embodiment, utility meter 208 bubbles-up more frequently around the time of an expected communication attempt, and bubbles-up less frequently at other times.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 3A and 3B, FIG. 3A illustrates an example bubble-up rate profile 300. Bubble-up rate profile 300 represents the varying bubble-up rate as a function of time t. A reference timeline 302 is provided, along with reference time instances t1-t21, which correspond to occurrences of various events described below. Bubble-up rate profile 300 is formed during operation of endpoint 208 as endpoint 208 adjusts its bubble-up rate. Endpoint 208 adjusts its bubble-up rate according to the following rules:\n\n    \n    \n        1. Endpoint 208 anticipates the time of the next communication attempt.\n        2. Endpoint 208 normally operates at a minimum bubble-up rate.\n        3. For a predetermined time ta prior to the next expected communication attempt, endpoint 208 begins operating at a predetermined higher bubble-up rate.\n        4. For a predetermined time th after each completed communication attempt, endpoint 208 maintains the higher bubble-up rate, and then returns to the minimum bubble-up rate. The maintained higher bubble-up rate accommodates the common practice of the AMR system initiating follow-up communications.\n        5. If an expected communication does not occur, after a predetermined time tp, endpoint 208 increments the bubble-up rate, in steps having time duration t1, up to a maximum bubble-up rate, which is maintained until a successful communication occurs. This rule is useful if a communication fails to occur at the scheduled time due to difficulty establishing communication with endpoint 208. The rule is designed to increase the probability of a successful communication by increasing the bubble-up rate.",
        "Bubble-up rate profile 300 includes periods 301a-301e (referred to generally as periods 301) during which bubble-up rate R is at relatively higher rates, such as rates R2 and R3. During periods other than periods 301, bubble-up rate R is at a relatively lower at a rate of R1. FIG. 3B illustrates the relationship between the bubble-up rate R and bubble-up events. Bubble-up events are indicated generally at 350 and at 352. Each bubble-up event 350, 352 includes an operation cycle of endpoint 208 in which endpoint 208 enters an active operating mode from a low power standby mode, performs designated functions, such as activating transceiver 218 and possibly communicating with AMR system 212, and returns to the low power standby mode. Bubble-up events 350, including individual bubble-up events 350a and 350b, occur at an interval T1. Bubble-up events 352, including 352a and 352b, occur during period 301 and have an interval T2, which is shorter in time relative to interval T1. Bubble-up rate R1 of bubble-up events 350 is 1/T1. Bubble-up rate R2 of bubble-up events 352 is 1/T2. In one embodiment, periods T1, and T2 are on the order of seconds, or tens of seconds.",
        "Endpoint 208 expects communication attempts at certain time instances. In one embodiment, at any instant in time, endpoint 208 expects only the next future communication attempt. In another embodiment, endpoint 208 maintains the current date/time, and expects one or more future events at defined times. Referring again to FIG. 3A, communication attempts that are expected by endpoint 208 are each marked with an \u201cX\u201d corresponding to the time at which each event is expected, and indicated generally at 304. For example, expected communication attempt 304a is expected to occur at time t2. Actual communications attempted by AMR system 212 are each represented by an \u201cO\u201d marked on timeline 302, and indicated generally at 306. Thus, communication attempt 306a coincides in time with expected communication attempt 304a at time t2. Successful communications are each represented by a \u201cdot\u201d and indicated generally at 308. For example, successful communication 308a coincides in time with expected communication attempt 304a and actual communication attempt 306a at time t2. In one embodiment, a successful communication is defined by endpoint 208 receiving a valid command and control frame from AMR system 212.",
        "Bubble-up rate profile 300, during the time preceding t1, remains at a constant minimum bubble-up rate R1. At time t1, and in anticipation of expected communication attempt 304a occurring at time t2 (according to Rule 3 described above), endpoint 208 increases the bubble-up rate to rate R2 for a time duration ta=t2\u2212t1 (indicated at 320). Increased bubble-up rate R2 creates conditions in which an occurrence of a successful communication is more probable. In this example, the time duration between ta corresponds to a preconfigured anticipatory period that has been selected to accommodate some degree of variation between the actual and expected times of each communication attempt. At time t2, communication attempt 306a occurs as expected, and results in successful communication 308a. At time t3, endpoint 208 reduces its bubble-up rate back to rate R1. During the time immediately following a communication, there is typically an increased likelihood that a follow-up communication will occur. To facilitate such follow-up communication attempts, for a time duration th (indicated at 322) between t3 and t2, bubble-up rate profile 300 remains at increased rate R2 pursuant to Rule 4 described above. In one embodiment, the time duration th to maintain increased bubble-up rate R2 after each communication event 308 is pre-configured in the control software of endpoint 208. In a related embodiment, time duration th can be varied to accommodate changes in a utility's AMR practices.",
        "Example events during period 301b (FIG. 3A) illustrate one approach to responding to a follow-up communication directed at endpoint 208. In the time preceding time t4, endpoint 208 expects a communication 304b at time t5. Accordingly, at time T4, endpoint 208 increases its bubble-up rate from R1 to R2 pursuant to Rule 3 described above. An actual communication 306b1, occurs at time t5, and results in a successful communication 308b1. Following communication 308b1, the bubble-up rate remains at R2 for a holding time th (indicated at 324) according to Rule 4 described above. Before expiration of time period th 324, another communication attempt, 306b2, occurs at time t6, and results in successful follow-up communication 308b2. A new holding time period th 326 begins at time t6, and extends until time t7, at which time the bubble-up rate is decreased back to rate R1.",
        "Example events during period 301c illustrate another approach to dealing with a follow-up communications. At time t9, a successful communication 308c1 occurs. For a time period th, as indicated at 328, the bubble-up rate is maintained at increased rate R2. Before expiration of time period th 328, a follow-up communication 308c2 occurs at time t10. However, unlike the example events described above with respect to time period 301b, follow-up communication 308c2 does not cause endpoint 208 to wait an additional time duration th before reducing the bubble-up rate back to R1. Thus, the bubble-up rate returns to rate R1 at time t11, which occurs at a time duration th following successful communication 308c1. This example approach can be useful when additional follow-up communications are considered unlikely soon after an initial follow-up communication such as communication 308c2.",
        "Example events during period 301d illustrate one approach of dealing with situations where an expected communications event fails to occur within an expected time period. Expected communication attempt 304d is anticipated to occur at time t13. Pursuant to Rule 3 described above, at time t12, which is time duration ta 330 before expected communication attempt 304d, bubble-up rate R is increased to R2. However, around time t13, a successful communication does not occur. This failure may be due to failure of the AMR system to attempt communication. Alternatively, the failure may be due to a failure to receive an attempted communication 306d1 by endpoint 208. Pursuant to Rule 5 described above, endpoint 208 maintains the bubble-up rate R for a preconfigured time tp after the time of expected communication attempt 304d. Thus, beginning at time t13, endpoint 208 begins measuring time duration tp. At the end of time duration tp (time t14), endpoint 208 increments bubble-up rate R pursuant to Rule 5 described above, and maintains the rate for a time duration ti, indicated at 334 until time t15. At times t15-t16 bubble-up rate R is sequentially incremented for durations ti (336, 338). At time t17, bubble-up rate R is incremented up to maximum rate R3 and maintained at R3. At time 318, a communication attempt 306d2 results in successful communication 308d. In response, endpoint 208 maintains bubble-up rate R for a time duration th 340 to accommodate any potential follow-up communications and is then reduced back to minimum bubble-up rate R1 at time t19.",
        "In one example embodiment, following a delayed communication such as communication 308d described above, endpoint 208 expects the next communication attempt 304e to occur according to a predetermined schedule that does not take into account any delay in the previous communication 308d. In another embodiment, the next expected communication attempt 304e is expected to occur at a different time that accounts for the delay of the earlier communication 308d. In either case, at time t20, in anticipation ta of expected communication 304e, bubble-up rate R is increased to rate R2 to facilitate communication attempt 306e resulting in successful communication 308e at time t21.",
        "FIG. 4 illustrates an example operation cycle 400 of an endpoint device that utilizes an adaptive variable bubble-up rate according to one embodiment of the invention. The bubble-up rate in this example is adaptive in the sense that the rate automatically adjusts in response to potentially changing AMR practices. An example endpoint device implementing operation cycle 400 utilizes three timers: (1) a bubble-up timer, (2) a command and control frame (C&C) timer, and (3) a hold time counter. The bubble-up timer is analogous to timer 222 (FIG. 2) that controls the initiation of each bubble-up event. In one embodiment, bubble-up events occur every 15 seconds.",
        "In one example embodiment, the bubble-up timer counts down from a set time duration representing the bubble-up period and, upon expiration of the set time duration, generates a signal that causes the endpoint device to begin bubbling up. However, persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the bubble-up timer can be configured any number of ways to provide a reference time duration. For example, the bubble-up timer can be configured to count from a first value to a second value based on a reference timing signal. In one example embodiment, the bubble-up timer is implemented with an electronic counter circuit that is clocked by a timing signal of a known frequency. In an alternative embodiment, the bubble-up timer is implemented by a microcontroller running a software program. In the example embodiment described below, the bubble-up timer is configured so that it has a minimum set point and a maximum set point. Otherwise, the bubble-up timer can be set to various time durations within the range defined by the minimum and maximum set points.",
        "The C&C timer measures the time between valid command and control frames, which represents the time between successive, successful communication events involving the endpoint device. The time between command and control frames is generally long enough to include a large plurality of bubble-up cycles. For example, in one embodiment, the C&C timer represents 30.5 days. In another example embodiment, the C&C timer is implemented with an electronic counter circuit that is clocked by a timing signal of a known frequency. In an alternative embodiment, the C&C timer is implemented by a microcontroller running a software program.",
        "The hold time counter provides a reference hold period during which the bubble-up rate is maintained at its set level. The hold period is generally long enough to include a smaller plurality of bubble-up cycles. For example, in one embodiment, the hold period is 24 hours. In one example embodiment, the hold time counter is implemented as an electronic counter circuit clocked by a known timing signal. In another embodiment, the hold time counter is implemented in software running on a microcontroller. In example operation cycle 400 described below, the hold time counter counts occurrences of bubble-up events from a preset maximum M, to zero, at which point the hold time is reached. Timing is achieved in this arrangement because each bubble-up cycle takes a certain amount of time T. Thus, the hold period is equal to M*T time units. In example operation cycle 400, the hold time counter can be set to represent three potentially different time periods: (1) a follow-up communication hold period, (2) a bubble-up rate decrease step hold period, and (3) a bubble-up rate increase step hold period. The use of these time periods is described below.",
        "During a majority of the time, the endpoint device operating according to operation cycle 400 is in a low-power standby mode between bubble-up events. In this mode, indicated at 402, the bubble-up timer is counting down to the next bubble-up event. In one example embodiment, the bubble-up timer is a digital counter circuit that counts down to zero from a set value based on a clocking signal having a known frequency. However, persons skilled in the art will recognize that the bubble-up timer can be implemented any number of ways within the spirit of the invention. For example, the bubble-up timer can be implemented as a counter that counts up to a second set value from a first set value. Also, the bubble-up timer can be implemented with a microprocessor running a software program.",
        "At 404, the bubble-up timer expires, or indicates that the set time duration has elapsed. In response, the endpoint device begins performing the various functions associated with a bubble-up event, such as receiving utility meter data, activating the transceiver circuit, potentially engaging in communications with an AMR system, and the like. In one example embodiment, the bubble-up event also includes the activities described below to adaptively configure the endpoint device for the next bubble-up operation cycle.",
        "At 406, the endpoint device determines whether or not a successful communication has occurred during the present bubble-up cycle. If a valid wakeup sequence was detected (indicating a successful communication), at 408, the C&C timer is read. As described above, the C&C timer measures the time duration between valid command and control frames. In one embodiment, the endpoint device maintains a log of C&C timer measurements. In one example embodiment, the most recent 12 measurements are kept in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue. At 410, the most recent measurement made at 408 is entered into the queue, and the least recent entry in the queue is purged. At 412, the C&C timer is reset and restarted.",
        "The time between successful communications is useful for estimating the time of the next expected communication attempt. At 414, the next expected communication attempt is computed. One method of computing the next expected communication attempt involves taking an average of the logged C&C timer measurements. In one example embodiment, where 12 measurements are stored in queue, the two highest and two lowest values are discarded prior to averaging the remaining 8 values. By utilizing a running average to predict each next expected communication attempt, the endpoint device will adapt to changing AMR practices.",
        "At 416, also in response to the detection of the valid wakeup sequence, the bubble-up timer is set to its minimum value, thereby causing the endpoint device to bubble-up at the highest allowed bubble-up rate. In one example embodiment, the minimum bubble-up timer setting is 5 seconds. At 418, the hold time counter is set to represent a time duration referred to above as the follow-up communication hold period. During the follow-up communication hold period, the endpoint maintains a maximum bubble-up rate to maintain the highest probability of achieving a successful follow-up communication between the endpoint device and the AMR system. The follow-up communication hold period is analogous to time duration th described above with reference to FIG. 3A. At 420, regardless of whether a valid wakeup sequence was detected at 406, the endpoint device determines if the hold time counter has expired. If the hold time counter has not expired, the hold time counter is decremented at 422, and operation cycle 400 is repeated at the maximum bubble-up rate. If the hold time counter has expired, this indicates that the bubble-up rate can be reduced to conserve energy. At this point, it is implicit that occurrence of a communication event has become less likely.",
        "In example operation cycle 400, the bubble-up rate is varied according to preconfigured steps. Accordingly, when it is time to increase or decrease the bubble-up rate, the rate is changed by a specific amount, resulting in a new bubble-up rate. The new bubble-up rate is maintained for a minimum time, or for a minimum number of bubble-up events. The hold time counter is used to determine the duration of each step. The size of steps increasing the bubble-up rate can be different from the steps decreasing the bubble-up rate.",
        "When the bubble-up profile is at a point where the bubble-up rate can be changed (i.e. when the hold timer has expired), endpoint device first determines the direction of the bubble-up rate change. In example operation cycle 400, at 424, the endpoint device determines the direction of the bubble-up rate change by testing whether \u00be of the time until the next expected communication attempt has elapsed. At \u00be of the time until the next expected communication attempt and later, there is an increasing likelihood that a communications attempt will occur. Thus, if \u00be of the time until the next expected communication attempt has not elapsed, the endpoint device takes steps to decrease the bubble-up rate by correspondingly incrementing the bubble-up timer. Thus, at 426, the endpoint device determines whether the bubble-up timer is already set at its maximum limit. If it is, then there is no need to further increment the bubble-up timer, and the operation cycle is repeated. If, however, the bubble-up timer is not at its maximum limit, then, at 428, the hold time counter is set to represent the bubble-up rate decrease step hold period. Next, at 430, the bubble-up rate is incremented by a step size associated with incrementing the bubble-up rate. In one example embodiment, this \u201cup\u201d step size is 1 second.",
        "In the next sequential cycle 400, the hold timer will not have expired at 420. Thus, the timer will be decremented towards its expiration and the cycle will repeat. After expiration of the hold time counter, the bubble-up timer will be incremented towards its maximum limit. Eventually, the bubble-up timer will remain at its maximum limit until \u00be of the time until the next expected communication event elapses (determined at 424).",
        "After \u00be of the time until the next expected communication event has elapsed, the endpoint device begins incrementing the bubble-up rate by correspondingly decrementing the bubble-up timer at 432, 434, and 436. As the current time approaches the time of the next expected communications attempt, the probability of an actual communications attempt occurring, increases. Accordingly, at 432, the endpoint device determines whether the bubble-up timer is already set at its minimum limit. If it is, then there is no need to further decrement the bubble-up timer, and the operation cycle is repeated. If, however, the bubble-up timer is not at its minimum limit, then, at 434, the hold time counter is set to represent the bubble-up rate increase step hold period. Next, at 436, the bubble-up rate is incremented by a step size associated with decrementing the bubble-up rate. In one example embodiment, this \u201cdown\u201d step size is 2 seconds. Eventually, the bubble-up timer will reach its minimum setting and remain at that setting until a follow-up communication hold period after the next successful communications event.",
        "FIG. 5 illustrates an example bubble-up rate profile 500 that is produced by operation of an endpoint device utilizing example operation cycle 400 described above. In this embodiment, the bubble-up rate R is varied according to the expectation level of an upcoming communication attempt. Example operation profile is plotted against time axis 502. Expected communication attempts are indicated respectively at 504a-504d, and are referred to generally as expected communication attempts 504. Actual communication attempts are indicated generally at 506, while actual successful communications events are indicated generally at 508. Bubble-up rates Rmin, Rmax and R2-R6, are plotted along the vertical bubble-up rate axis R. Rate Rmin represents the minimum bubble-up rate, which corresponds to the maximum bubble-up timer setting above with referenced in FIG. 4. Rate Rmax represents the maximum bubble-up rate, which corresponds to the minimum bubble-up timer setting discussed above with reference to FIG. 4.",
        "Example bubble-up rate profile 500 represents bubble-up rate R varying over time within rate limits Rmax and Rmin. At time prior to t1, bubble-up rate R is at rate Rmax in expectation of expected communication attempt 504a. At time t1, communication attempt 506a occurs, resulting in successful communication 508a. During a bubble-up event, pursuant to detection 406 of example operation cycle 400 (FIG. 4), the endpoint device detects a valid wakeup sequence contained in the communication attempt 506. The endpoint device proceeds to calculate the time of next expected communication event 504b.",
        "During follow-up communication hold period tf 510, the endpoint device maintains the bubble-up rate R at Rmax. After the expiration of the follow-up communication hold period tf 510, the probability of another communication attempt begins to decrease and the endpoint device can have a lesser expectation of such an event occurring. Therefore, the bubble-up rate may be decreased to conserve energy. Accordingly, at time t2, the hold period expires, and the endpoint device begins to step down bubble-up rate R. The hold time counter is re-set to rate decrease step hold period tsd 512. Rate decrease step hold period tsd 512 is tolled beginning at time t2. At time t3, rate decrease step hold period tsd 512 expires. During time period t3-t2, the bubble-up rate R is maintained at rate R6. This step-wise bubble-up rate reduction is continued sequentially, as depicted in FIG. 5, for the time periods t4-t3, t5-t4, t6-t5, and t7-t6bubble-up rate R is set respectively to R5, R4, R3, and R2. Each bubble-up rate decrease is achieved by incrementing the bubble-up timer by one up step, pursuant to 430 (FIG. 4). In this example, each timer up step is designated as ru, in FIG. 5, and indicated at 514. At time t7, the bubble-up rate reaches pre-defined minimum limit Rmin, and this rate is maintained until the time t8 to begin increasing the bubble-up rate in anticipation of the next expected communication attempt 504b occurs.",
        "As more time passes following a successful communication event, the probability of an occurrence of a communication attempt begins to increase, so the endpoint device can begin to increase its bubble-up rate accordingly. At time t8, \u00be of the time to the next expected communication attempt has elapsed. The \u00be elapsed time period has been pre-defined in this embodiment as the point at which the endpoint will expect an increased likelihood of a communication attempt. Pursuant to decisions 424 and 432, and steps 434 and 436 (FIG. 4) the hold time counter is re-set to a rate increase step hold period tsi 516. Beginning at time t8, bubble-up rate R is incremented by decrementing the bubble-up timer by one down step rd. In this example, down step rd is equal in magnitude to twice the up step ru (rd=2ru). Thus, during time period t9-t8, bubble-up rate R is maintained at R3. Likewise, during the period t10-t9, bubble-up rate R is at rate R5. At time t10, bubble-up rate R is incremented again to the maximum bubble-up rate limit Rmax, which corresponds to a minimum bubble-up timer limit. At its maximum rate Rmax, bubble-up rate R facilitates the greatest probability of achieving a successful communication between the endpoint device and the AMR system.",
        "At time t11, communication attempt 506b1 occurs resulting in successful communication 508b1. A follow-up communication hold period tf 518 is observed. Also, time period TA between successful communications 508b1 508a is logged in the C&C queue according to steps 408, 410 (FIG. 4), and is used for calculating the time of the next expected communication attempt. At time t12 an unexpected follow-up communication 506b2 occurs resulting in successful communication 508b2. In response, another follow-up communication hold period tf 520 is observed. In this example embodiment, the time period TB 524 between follow-up communication 508B2 and communication 508b1 is disregarded from the computation of the next expected communication attempt. The time of expected communication attempt 504b has been determined based on the averaging successful communication events occurring prior to communication 508a.",
        "Because in this example, successful communication 508b1 coincides with the time of expected communication attempt 504b, time duration TA is equal to the previously-computed average time durations between the relevant past communication events. Accordingly, the time of the next communication event 504c is expected to also occur at time t14, which is at a time duration TA (indicated at 526) following communication event 508b1. However, the next actual communication attempt 506c does not coincide with the expected communication attempt 504c. Instead, it occurs at a later time t15, and results in successful communication 508c. The endpoint device logs time duration TC 528 for calculating the next expected communication attempt 504d. The next expected communication attempt 504d is expected at a time duration TD 530 following the previous successful communication 508c. Time duration TD 530 is somewhat longer than time duration TA, but less than time duration TC.",
        "In the manner described above in this example embodiment, the bubble-up rate R is varied roughly in proportion to the expectation level of an occurrence of a future communication attempt 504. Over time, the bubble-up rate variation defines a bubble-up profile 500; bubble-up profile 500 being neither predetermined, nor fixed. Rather, bubble-up profile 500 dynamically varies depending on the occurrences or non-occurrences of communications events, and the relative timing between the communications events.",
        "The above-described example operation cycle 400 (FIG. 4) is simply one way of realizing a dynamically adjustable bubble-up rate for an endpoint device according to one aspect of the present invention. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that aspects of the present invention can be embodied in a variety of alternative embodiments. For example, an example endpoint device can compute an expectation function, over time, of a future occurrence of a communication event. The example endpoint device can then use the present expectation level to set the bubble-up rate. In this example embodiment, the bubble-up rate is varied more closely in proportion with the expectation function. In a related embodiment, the bubble-up rate is varied without regard to hold times. Hence, when viewed over time, the bubble rate profile will appear as a smoother function, without the step-wise bubble-up rate changes depicted in example bubble-up rate profiles 300 (FIG. 3A) and 500 (FIG. 5).",
