        "This is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/978,870 filed Oct. 29, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,115,058, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.",
        "The present invention relates to automotive axle assemblies. In particular, the present invention relates to a differential carrier assembly having an electric drive assembly.",
        "Automobile manufacturers are increasingly offering for sale automobiles powered by electric motors. Electric motors provide numerous advantages when compared to traditional combustion engines. For example, electric motors typically operate more efficiently and emit fewer undesirable emissions to the environment. However, combustion engines generally outperform electric motors in numerous other performance categories and typically provide higher horsepower per pound when the weight of batteries are taken into consideration. Further, automobiles propelled by electric motors are generally more expensive than automobiles propelled by combustion engines and need to be recharged more often than a vehicle propelled by a combustion engine needs to be refueled. Therefore, in spite of the advantages associated with electric motors, consumers are generally reluctant to purchase motor vehicles propelled solely by electric motors.",
        "Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a motor vehicle that offers the advantages of an electric engine, such as increased efficiency, as well as the advantages of a combustion engine, such as reduced cost and enhanced performance.",

A first pinion is in meshing engagement with the ring gear. The first pinion is adapted to be driven by a combustion engine and is operable to drive the ring gear. An electric drive assembly is mounted to the carrier housing. The electric drive assembly includes an electric motor and a second pinion. The second pinion is in meshing engagement with the ring gear. The second pinion is selectively driven by the electric motor and is operable to drive the ring gear.",
        "In another form, the present invention provides for an axle assembly for a motor vehicle. The axle assembly comprises a carrier housing and a ring gear rotatably mounted within the carrier housing. A first pinion is in meshing engagement with the ring gear and is operable to drive the ring gear. A second pinion is in meshing engagement with the ring gear. The second pinion is also operable to drive the ring gear. An electric motor is mounted to the carrier housing. A controller monitors the operating parameters of the motor vehicle. The controller selectively activates and deactivates the electric motor in response to the status of the operating parameters.",
        "In yet another form, the present invention provides for a method for propelling a motor vehicle having both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. The internal combustion engine is selectively coupled to a ring gear. The ring gear is rotatably mounted within a carrier housing. The electric motor is selectively operable to provide drive torque to the ring gear. The method comprises the following steps: drivingly interconnecting the ring gear and the combustion engine; drivingly interconnecting the ring and the electric motor; monitoring predetermined operating parameters of the motor vehicle using a controller; and selectively activating and deactivating the electric motor based on the status of the predetermined operating parameters.",
        "Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter.

The gear teeth 174 can be of any suitable shape or size that allows the teeth to meshingly engage the teeth 83 of the ring gear 82, which also can be of any suitable shape or size. Furthermore, as illustrated, the axis 175 may be offset from axis 46 to form a hypoid gear arrangement.",
        "The motor 162 and the clutch 164 are both seated within a motor housing 178. The motor housing 178 is rigidly coupled to an interior of the support casing 150 in any suitable manner. The motor housing 178 can also be integral with the casing 150. The motor housing 178 includes an interior aperture 180 that extends through the approximate center of the motor housing 178. The tail 170 extends through the interior aperture 180. The motor housing 178 also includes cooling fins 182. The cooling fins 182 are located on an outer surface of the housing 178 to increase the surface area of the motor housing 178 and assist in cooling the components of the housing 178, such as the electric motor 162 and the clutch 164 assembly.",
        "The motor 162 is integral with or mounted within the motor housing 178 using any suitable mounting means. The motor 162 can be any suitable electric motor. The motor 162 includes a rotor 184. The rotor 184 is generally cylindrical and has a center aperture. The rotor 184 is rotationally mounted within the housing 178. The rotor 184 rotates about the third axis 175. The pinion tail 170 extends through the center aperture of the rotor 184. Thus, the rotor 184 may rotate about the pinion tail 170. The motor 162 is powered by any suitable power source, such as the alternator 28 or the battery 29.",
        "The clutch assembly 164 generally includes a clutch pack 190 and an actuator 192. The clutch pack 190 includes a series of first clutch plates 194 and a series of second clutch plates 196. The first clutch plates 194 are splined to the tail 170 of the second pinion 160 and the second clutch plates 196 are splined to the rotor 184. The first and second clutch plates 194 and 196 are interleaved with one another. The first and second clutch plates 194 and 196 are axially slidable along the third axis 175. The actuator 192 is operable to axially slide the second clutch plates 196 into engagement with the first clutch plates 194. The actuator 192 can be any conventional actuator. For example, the actuator 192 can be a hydraulic actuator or an electric actuator, which could be powered by the alternator 28 or the battery 29. When the first and second clutch plates 194 and 196 engage each other, rotation of the rotor 184 effectuates rotation of the second pinion 160.",
        "The controller 30 monitors various operating parameters of the vehicle 10 and controls the operation of the electric drive assembly 26. The controller 30 can by any suitable signal processing device or control device, such as a microcomputer. The controller receives inputs from various sensors 32, which monitor different parameters of the vehicle 10. The sensors 32 can each be any suitable conventional sensing device. Specifically, and as shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, the sensor 32A monitors the speed of the engine 16. The sensor 32B monitors the revolutions of the drive shaft 20 to determine the ground speed of the vehicle 10. The sensor 32C monitors the rotational speed of the ring gear 82. The sensor 32D monitors the rotational speed of the second pinion 160. The sensor 32E monitors the operation of the electric motor 162, the position of the clutch 164, and the position of the actuator 192. The sensor 32F monitors the throttle position as an indication of the amount of acceleration desired by the operator. The controller 30 is also operable to send commands to the engine 16 and the electric drive assembly 26 to control their operation.",
        "The controller 30 activates the electric drive assembly 26 when certain predetermined operating conditions of the motor vehicle 10 are present. In some applications, the controller 30 is programmed to activate the electric drive assembly 26 when the vehicle 10 is accelerating from a standstill, such as between 0 mph and 10 mph, and at highway cruising speeds, such as above 55 mph. However, the controller 30 can be programmed to activate the electric drive assembly 26 in response to the occurrence of a variety of different conditions.",
        "Operation of the electric drive assembly 26 when the controller 30 is programmed to activate the motor 162 at lower speeds (speeds less than 10 mph) and highway cruising speeds (speeds greater than 55 mph) will now be described in detail. If vehicle 10 is at a stationary position, or rolling at less than 10 mph, sensor 32B sends a signal to the controller 30 as such. Controller 30 also receives a signal from sensor 32F indicative of the throttle position. The controller then sends commands to the motor 162 and the actuator 192 to activate the motor 162 and the actuator 192 if vehicle acceleration is requested. Activation of the motor 162 causes the rotor 184 to rotate about the third axis of rotation 175. The activated actuator 192 axially slides the first clutch plates 194 and the second clutch plates 196 into engagement to drivingly interconnect the rotor 184 and the second pinion tail 170. Therefore, rotation of the rotor 184 effectuates rotation of the second pinion 160.",
        "The controller 30 also controls the speed at which the rotor 184 and the second pinion 160 rotate. During acceleration of the vehicle 10, the second pinion 160 exerts a driving force on the ring gear 82 to supplement the driving force that the first pinion 110 exerts upon the ring gear 82. This condition allows decreasing the output required by the engine 16. To properly operate motor 162, the controller 30 identifies the speed of the engine 16, the speed of the ring gear 82 and the position of the throttle. Use of the motor 162 in this manner to decrease the load on the engine 16 advantageously improves the fuel economy of the vehicle 10 and prolongs the life of the engine 16.",
        "After the controller 30 determines that the speed of the vehicle 10 is greater than 10 mph by processing inputs from the sensor 32B, the controller 30 sends a signal to the motor 162 to deactivate the motor 162. Even after the motor 162 is deactivated, the second pinion 160 continues to rotate due to the cooperation between the head 172 and the ring gear 82. At this time, motor 162 may be decoupled from second pinion 160 or may remain coupled to provide braking. For example, the controller 30 may be programmed to deactivate actuator 192 to decouple the second pinion 160 from the rotor 184. Alternatively, if the second pinion 160 and the rotor 184 remain coupled, then rotation of the second pinion due to rotation of the ring gear 82 results in rotation of the rotor 184, thus causing the motor 162 to act as a generator. Electricity generated by the motor 162 can be transferred to the battery 29 during a charging operation. If the second pinion 160 and the rotor 184 are decoupled then the second pinion 160 freely spins and no electricity is generated.",
        "The electric drive assembly 26 can also serve as the sole source of propulsion for the vehicle 10. For example, after the vehicle 10 is propelled to a predetermined cruising speed by the engine 16, such as 55 mph, the controller 30 can activate the electric motor 162 to rotate the second pinion 160 in the manner set forth above. The controller 30 then commands the engine 16 to reduce its RPM output to idle and the rotational speed of the second pinion 160 is set to provide the entire driving force necessary to drive the ring gear 82 and propel the vehicle 10. At idle, the engine 16 is still operable to maintain the power steering, power brakes, and other vehicle accessories, but uses far less fuel and improves the vehicle's fuel economy. To accelerate the vehicle 10 after the engine 16 is brought to idle, the controller 30 can increase the rotational speed of the second pinion 160 and/or increase the speed of the engine 16 to increase the rotational speed of the first pinion 110. The motor 162 can also be used to provide the entire driving force necessary to drive the ring gear 82 to propel the vehicle 10 from a standstill.",
        "FIG. 4 illustrates an electric drive assembly according to an additional embodiment at reference numeral 200. The electric drive assembly 200 is similar to the electric drive assembly 26 and like reference numbers are used to identify like elements of the embodiments with the like elements of the assembly 200 including the prime (\u2032) designation. The above description of the like elements and their operation equally applies to the assembly 200.",
        "The assembly 200 is a simplified version of assembly 26 and does not include the clutch assembly 164. In the assembly 200, the rotor 184\u2032 of the motor 162\u2032 is rotationally fixed to the tail 170\u2032 of the second pinion 160\u2032. Therefore, rotation of the second pinion 160\u2032 by the ring gear 82 when the motor 162\u2032 is not activated causes the rotor 184\u2032 to rotate. Controller 30 is operable to allow motor 162\u2032 to rotate freely or to function as a generator to generate electricity.",
        "FIG. 5 illustrates an electric drive assembly according to an alternate embodiment at reference numeral 300. The electric drive assembly 300 is similar to the electric drive assemblies 26 and 200 and like reference numbers are used to identify like elements of the embodiments with the like elements of the assembly 300 including the double prime (\u2033) designation. The above description of the like elements equally applies to the assembly 300.",
        "The assembly 300 is substantially similar to the assembly 200 except that the assembly 300 includes a pinion actuator 302. The actuator 302 can be any conventional actuator that is operable to linearly slide the second pinion 160\u2033 along the third axis 175\u2033 between a first position A, in which the head 172\u2033 meshingly engages the ring gear 82, and a second position B, in which the head 172\u2033 is spaced apart from the ring gear 82. In this embodiment, when torque is required from the motor 162\u2033, the controller 30 checks the position of the actuator 302 using the sensor 32E to make sure that the second pinion 160\u2033 is at position A. If the second pinion 160\u2033 is not at position A then the controller activates the actuator 302 to move the second pinion 160\u2033 to position A.",
        "When the controller 30 determines that use of the motor 162\u2033 is not necessary, the controller 30 deactivates the motor 162\u2033. If the controller 30 determines that the battery 29, or other device, needs to be recharged, the controller 30 keeps the second pinion 160\u2033 at position A so that rotation of the second pinion 160\u2033 by the ring gear 82 will rotate the rotor 184\u2033 and cause the motor 162\u2033 to generate electricity that can be stored by the battery 29. If the controller 30 determines that the motor 162\u2033 does not need to be used to generate electricity, then the controller 30 signals the actuator 302 to move the second pinion 160\u2033 to position B so that the second pinion 160\u2033 is not in drivingly engaged with the ring gear 82. Use of the assembly 300 is advantageous because the second pinion 160\u2033 can be moved from engagement with the ring gear 82 when the motor 162\u2033 is not in use and, therefore, the second pinion 160\u2033 does not cause unnecessary drag on the ring gear 82, which can negatively effect fuel economy. The actuator 302 of the assembly 300 can also be provided in the assemblies 26 and 200 described above to move the second pinions 160 and 160\u2032 into and out of engagement with the ring gear 82 as desired.",
        "One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the electric drive assemblies 26, 200, and 300 of the present invention can be adapted for use with most any type of motor vehicle. For example, the assemblies 26, 200, and 300 can be adapted to vehicles having front wheel drive, rear wheel drive, two wheel drive, four wheel drive, and all wheel drive systems. Further, the assemblies 26, 200, and 300 may be mounted to existing carrier assemblies of previously manufactured vehicles. Also, the assemblies 26, 200, and 300 may be provided with new carrier assemblies of new vehicles.",
        "Therefore, the electric drive assembly of the present invention is operable to increase the fuel economy of the vehicle 10 and decrease the load on the engine 16 by driving a second pinion 160 that is in cooperation with the ring gear 82. The driving force exerted by the second pinion 160 replaces or supplements the driving force of the first pinion 110 and thus the output required of the engine 16 is decreased. The electric motor 162 may be in operation at all times or only at select times, such as during acceleration when the demands of the engine 16 are the greatest or during highway cruising speeds when the electric motor 162 is capable of solely propelling the vehicle 10 with minimal performance loss. The electric drive assembly offers such advantages while still providing the user with the performance advantages of a traditional combustion engine.",
        "Furthermore, the foregoing discussion discloses and describes merely exemplary embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from such discussion, and from the accompanying drawings and claims, that various changes, modifications and variations may be made therein without department from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims."
