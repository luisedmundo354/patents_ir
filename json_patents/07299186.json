        "A comprehensive recognition evaluating mean 503c comprehensively evaluates recognition results of the individual recognizing engines. Generally, the connected speech recognizing engine uses a recognizing method for using a transition probability model between words, and presents an increased number of recognition errors when a short word such as a command is entered since knowledge on the preceding and the following words is not used.",
        "Thus, it is required for the comprehensive recognition evaluating mean to comprehensively determine which output from the recognizing engines is correct.",
        "The following section specifically describes the operation of the comprehensive recognition evaluating mean 503c while using a specific example, and referring to FIG. 10 to FIG. 13.",
        "FIG. 10 to FIG. 11 show examples where a speech time is used to switch the recognition results from the two recognizing engines. The comprehensive recognition evaluating mean 503c compares the speech data Vin with a threshold, and switches to S when Vin short and switches to L when Vin is long in the speech time evaluation.",

        "It is set that the engine provides a string \u201c=?\u201d for indicating that the recognition is impossible when the recognizing engine receives a speech which is largely different from the dictionary. In this case, when the threshold is selected to a proper value (example: the maximum length of the command strings), an optimal string is provided, thereby improving the overall recognition capability.",
        "As describe in the two types of methods above, when the speech data is a command \u201c\u201d, a problem that a string \u201c\u201d is provided when there is only the connected speech recognizing engine is solved.",

When the command converting mean receives a string Vtext1 from the speech recognizing mean 503, a command string search 505a uses the command text dictionary to determine if a command string is included.",
        "FIG. 15 is a figure for showing an example of the speech command text dictionary of the present invention. The command text dictionary 506 includes a command ID and command name 1 to command name 5, and any commands with the same command ID are treated in the same way. A string \u201c\u201d and a string \u201c\u201d are determined as an identical command ID, D01.",
        "Command text strings in FIG. 15 are roughly classified into commands corresponding to the individual information ASP's (NO 1 to NO 8), commands for speech conversation (NO 9 to NO 10), and commands for screen operations (NO 11 to NO 22).",
        "Though command string search assumes a complete match, it may be designed that the search can be conducted for a case where a partial error is included as described later in FIG. 23 to FIG. 24.",
        "Object extraction 505b for extracting a string of an object other than a command is conducted after the command string search 505a. This processing is a processing for extracting a command transmitted to the individual APS's, and an object which is a subject of the search.",

When a result Vtext1 of the speech recognizing mean is \u201c\u201d the command text search 505a refers to the command text dictionary 506, determines that the command string is \u201c\u201d and determines that the command ID is D01.",
        "Then the object extraction 505b determines that the part other than the command string is an object, and an object \u201c\u201d is extracted. Thus, a result Vtext2 of the object extracting mean 505b is provided as \u201ccommand ID=D01, Object=\u201d.",
        "Though the entire string other than the command characters is assumed as an object in the object extracting mean 505b, it is possible to conduct a morpheme analysis to remove \u201c\u201d from \u201c\u201d for the extraction.",
