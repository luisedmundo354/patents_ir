        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a fluid filter, a drain mechanism thereof, a draining jig used in the fluid filter and a draining method of the fluid filter. The present invention more particularly relates to a fluid filter, a drain mechanism thereof, a draining jig used in the fluid filter and a draining method of the fluid filter, in which a heated fluid is not splashed on a worker at a time of discharging the fluid such as a time of exchanging an element, and can maintain a high reliability in sealing a drain hole for a long time period while inhibiting dusts or the like from being mixed from an external portion at a time of normal use.",
        "The present invention can be widely used, for example, in an oil filter for filtering foreign materials, abraded powders, carbon and the like mixed in an oil lubricating an internal combustion engine, a fuel filter and a field relevant thereto.",
        "2. Description of Prior Art",
        "Conventionally, as a fluid filter, there has been generally known, for example, an element replacement type fluid filter in which a filter element is replaced at a time when a filter media is clogged after a predetermined time has passed and reaches a service life.",
        "As a drain mechanism of the element replacement type fluid filter, there has been known, for example, a structure in which a drain member (a drain plug 15) is screwed with a drain hole formed in a cap (a lower case 12) (refer to a patent document 1). Accordingly, it is possible to detach the drain member from the drain hole by loosening the drain member so as to leave open the drain hole prior to separating the case and the cap by canceling the engagement between both the elements, thereby discharging a residual oil in an inner portion of the housing from the drain hole.",
        "In this case, in the fluid filter for filtering an engine oil for a vehicle, an engine is frequently warmed up at a time of replacing the filter element, and the oil is in a heated state.",
        "However, in the conventional drain mechanism, discharging the residual oil at a time of replacing the filter element is performed by detaching the drain member from the cap. In other words, at the same time when the drain member is loosened, and a sealing of a seal member (a packing 15a) for the drain member is cancelled, discharging the residual oil is started. As a result, there is generated a disadvantage that the heated residual oil overflows during a detaching operation of the drain member, and is splashed on hands of the worker.",
        "Consequently, as the conventional drain mechanism of the fluid filter for solving the problem mentioned above, there has been known, for example, a structure in which a tubular drain pipe member (a drain plug 15) having a drain passage (a center hole 15g and a window hole 15f) is screwed with a drain hole formed in a cap (a lower case 12) (refer to a patent document 2).",
        "The drain passage of the drain pipe member and the inner portion of the housing are sealed by a pair of seal members (the packing 15g) attached to an outer periphery of the drain pipe member, at a time of normally using the fluid filter. Further, when replacing the filter element, the sealing of the upper seal member is cancelled by loosening the drain pipe member, the drain passage of the drain pipe member and the inner portion of the housing are communicated with each other, and the residual oil within the housing is discharged via the drain passage.",
        "Since the residual oil is discharged via the drain passage of the drain pipe member in the manner mentioned above, it is possible to prevent the oil in the middle of the discharging from being splashed on the hands of the worker.",
        "In this case, when the seal of the upper seal member is cancelled by loosening the drain pipe member, the seal of the lower seal member is maintained, so that the residual oil does not leak out from the other portions than the drain passage of the drain pipe member at a time of discharging the residual oil.",
        "Patent Document 1",
        "Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2000-42309",
        "Patent Document 2",
        "Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 11-104408",
        "However, in the drain mechanism of the conventional fluid filter, since the drain pipe member is formed in the hollow shape and is structured such as to have the drain passage, dusts or the like such as sediments or mud or the like is mixed into the inner portion of the cap through the drain passage of the drain pipe member from the external portion, during a normal use of the fluid filter, so that it is hard to secure a reliability of seal in the drain hole achieved by the seal member.",
        "As mentioned above, the present invention is made by taking the actual condition mentioned above into consideration, and an object of the present invention is to provide a drain mechanism of a fluid filter in which a heated fluid is not splashed on a worker at a time of discharging the fluid such as a time of exchanging an element, and can maintain a high reliability in sealing a drain hole for a long time period while inhibiting dusts or the like from being mixed from an external portion at a time of normal use.",
        "Further, another object of the present invention is to provide a fluid filter having the drain mechanism mentioned above, a draining jig preferably used in the fluid filter and a preferable draining method of the fluid filter.",

Further, an O-ring 17 (exemplified as a seal member) is attached to a lower end portion of the bottom portion 3a in the cap 3 so as to surround the drain hole 15. Further, an annular cap projection portion 18 (exemplified as an engaged portion) is provided in an upper end portion of the bottom portion 3a in the cap 3.",
        "Next, a description will be given of the drain mechanism 7. The drain mechanism 7 is basically provided, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, with a metal drain bolt 20 (exemplified as a drain member), a metal valve member 21 and a spring 11 (exemplified as an elastic means). The drain bolt 20 has a plug portion 22 having a male screw 22a formed therein, and a flange portion 23 connected to a lower portion of the plug portion 22. Further, when engaging a male screw 22a of the drain bolt 20 with the female screw 15a of the drain hole 15 so as to screw the drain bolt 20 into the drain hole 15, the flange portion 23 of the drain bolt 20 is pressure contacted against the O-ring 17 and the drain hole 15 is sealed.",
        "The valve member 21 is formed in a socket shape as a whole, and has a contact portion 25 brought into contact with an outer peripheral surface of the cap projection portion 18. The contact portion 25 of the valve member 21 is normally brought into contact with the cap projection portion 18 on the basis of the energizing force of the spring 11, and the drain hole 15 is sealed by metal. Accordingly, even in a state in which the drain bolt 20 is detached from the drain hole 15, only a small amount of residual oil within the housing 4 is flowed out to the outer portion from the drain hole 15.",
        "(2) Structure of Draining Jig",
        "Next, a description will be given of the draining jig 30. The draining jig 30 is made of a synthetic resin and is formed in a tubular shape as a whole, as shown in FIG. 3. The draining jig 30 has a pipe-shaped portion 31 having both ends opened, an engaging portion 32 provided in an upper end portion of the pipe-shaped portion 31 and having an outward bulged shape, and a socket-shaped flange portion 33 provided in an intermediate portion of the pipe-shaped portion 31.",

        "Further, at a time of replacing the filter element 5, the O-rings 9 and 17 and the like, the worker first loosens the drain bolt 20 and detaches the drain bolt 20 from the drain hole 15. At this time, since the contact portion 25 of the valve member 21 is brought into contact with the cap projection portion 18 on the basis of the energizing force of the spring 11 so as to be sealed by metal seal, the residual oil within the housing 4 does not flow out to the outer portion from the drain hole 15.",
        "Thereafter, the worker inserts the draining jig 30 to the drain hole 15, and pushes up the valve member 21 by the upper end surface of the engaging portion 32 against the energizing force of the spring 11. Accordingly, the seal of the drain hole 15 achieved by the valve member 21 is cancelled, and the residual oil within the housing 4 is discharged to the outer portion via the slits 35b and the center hole 35a in the draining jig 30. In this case, the engaging portion 32 of the draining jig 30 is engaged with the cap projection portion 18 by inserting the draining jig 30 to the drain hole 15 accompanying with the elastic deformation, and the draining jig 30 is fixed to the cap 3. Further, in this fixed state, the flange portion 33 of the draining jig 30 is pressure contacted with the O-ring 17 provided in the bottom portion 3a of the cap 3 (refer to FIG. 3).",
        "Thereafter, the worker pulls out the cap 3 from the draining jig 30 at a time when the residual oil within the housing 4 is discharged, and loosens the cap 3 by using an attaching and detaching jig (not shown) so as to separate the cap 3 from the case 2, whereby a replacing work of the filter element 5, the O-rings 9 and 17 and the like is performed.",
        "(4) Effect of Embodiments",
        "As mentioned above, in accordance with the present embodiments, since the drain bolt 20 is screwed with the drain hole 15 and the drain hole 15 is completely closed at a time when the oil filter 1 is normally used, the dusts such as the sediment, the mud and the like are not mixed into the inner portion of the housing 4 via the drain hole 15 from the external portion, and it is possible to maintain a high sealing reliability of the O-ring 17 for a long time period. Further, at a time of replacing the element, since the residual oil is discharged by using the draining jig 30 prior to the separating work between the case 2 and the cap 3, it is possible to prevent the heated oil from being splashed on the worker at a time of discharging the oil.",
        "Further, in accordance with the present embodiment, since the draining jig 30 can be fixed to the cap 3 and cancelled the fixing on the basis of the attaching and detaching work between the engaging portion 32 of the draining jig 30 and the cap projection portion 18, it is possible to fix the draining jig 30 to the cap 3 at a time of discharging the oil, and it is possible to improve a workability thereof.",
        "Further, in accordance with the present embodiment, since the flange portion 33 of the draining jig 30 is pressure contacted with the O-ring 17 of the cap 3 so as to seal, in a state in which the draining jig 30 is fixed to the cap 3, it is possible to more securely prevent the fluid from flowing out to the outer portion from the other portions than the drain passage 35 of the draining jig 30 at a time of discharging the oil.",
        "In this case, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments mentioned above, and can be applied to variously modified embodiments within the scope of the present invention in correspondence to various objects and applications. In other words, in the embodiments mentioned above, the structure is made such that the oil is discharged to the oil receiving plate or the like placed below the draining jig 30 from the lower end opening of the draining jig 30, however, the structure is not limited to this. For example, the structure is made such that a connection portion 37 (refer to FIG. 3) having an outward bulged shape and provided in the lower end portion of the draining jig 30 is connected to one end of an oil discharging hose (not shown), and the oil is discharged via the hose. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the oil from being scattered at a time of discharging the oil.",
        "Further, in the embodiments mentioned above, the draining jig 30 is exemplified as a jig having an exclusive use of draining, however, the structure is not limited. For example, as shown in FIG. 4, the structure may be made such that a draining jig 42 is integrally provided in an attaching and detaching jig 38 for attaching and detaching the cap 3 with respect to the case 2 so as to structure the draining jig. Accordingly, it is possible to discharge the oil and the separate the cap 3 from the case in accordance with a series of works.",
        "Further, in the embodiment mentioned above, the metal seal caused by the contact between the contact portion 25 of the valve member 21 and the cap projection portion 18 is employed, however, the structure is not limited to this. For example, as shown in FIG. 4, an internal seal may be achieved by an O-ring 41 attached to the valve member 40."
