        "The present application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/056,074 filed Feb. 11, 2005 now abandoned.",
        "The present invention relates to a fluoropolymer composite bundle and, more particularly, to ropes and other textiles made of composite bundles including fluoropolymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).",
        "As used in this application, the term \u201cfiber\u201d means a threadlike article as indicated at 16 and 18 of FIG. 1. Fiber as used herein includes monofilament fiber and multifilament fiber. A plurality of fibers may be combined to form a \u201cbundle\u201d 14 as shown in FIG. 1. When different types of fibers are combined to form a bundle, it is referred to herein as a \u201ccomposite bundle.\u201d A plurality of bundles may be combined to form a \u201cbundle group\u201d 12 as shown in FIG. 1. A plurality of bundle groups may be combined to form a \u201crope\u201d 10 as shown in FIG. 1 (although alternative rope constructions are contemplated and included in this invention as described herein).",
        "\u201cRepeated stress applications\u201d as used herein means those applications in which fibers are subjected to tensile, bending, or torsional forces, or combinations thereof, that result in abrasion and/or compression failures of the fiber, such as in ropes for mooring and heavy lifting applications, including, for instance, oceanographic, marine, and offshore drilling applications, and in ropes which are bent under tension against a pulley, drum, or sheave.",
        "\u201cHigh strength fiber\u201d as used herein refers to a fiber having a tenacity of greater than 15 g/d.",
        "\u201cAbrasion rate\u201d as used herein means the quotient of the decrease in the break force of a sample and the number of abrasion test cycles (as further defined in Example 1).",
        "\u201cRatio of break strengths after abrasion test\u201d as used herein means the quotient of the break strength after the abrasion test for a given test article that includes the addition of fluoropolymer fibers and the break strength after the abrasion test for the same construction of the test article without the addition of the fluoropolymer fibers.",
        "\u201cLow density\u201d as used herein means density less than about 1 g/cc.",
        "\u201cPersistence\u201d is defined as the ability to remain effectively in position during use.",
        "\u201cD:d\u201d as used herein means sheave diameter divided by the rope diameter.",
        "\u201cLow coefficient of friction fiber\u201d as used herein means a polymeric material having a coefficient of friction equal to or less than that of dry polypropylene on steel.",
        "High-strength fibers are used in many applications. For example, polymeric ropes are widely used in mooring and heavy lifting applications, including, for instance, oceanographic, marine, and offshore drilling applications. They are subjected to high tensile and bending stresses in use as well as a wide range of environmental challenges. These ropes are constructed in a variety of ways from various fiber types. For example, the ropes may be braided ropes, wire-lay ropes, or parallel strand ropes. Braided ropes are formed by braiding or plaiting bundle groups together as opposed to twisting them together. Wire-lay ropes are made in a similar manner as wire ropes, where each layer of twisted bundles is generally wound (laid) in the same direction about the center axis. Parallel strand ropes are an assemblage of bundle groups held together by a braided or extruded jacket.",
        "Component fibers in ropes used in mooring and heavy lifting applications include high modulus and high strength fibers such as ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers. DYNEEMA\u00ae and SPECTRA\u00ae brand fibers are examples of such fibers. Liquid crystal polymer (LCP) fibers such as liquid crystal aromatic polyester sold under the tradename VECTRAN\u00ae are also used to construct such ropes. Para-aramid fibers, such as Kevlar\u00ae fiber, likewise, also have utility in such applications.",
        "The service life of these ropes is compromised by one or more of three mechanisms. Fiber abrasion is one of the mechanisms. This abrasion could be fiber-to-fiber abrasion internally or external abrasion of the fibers against another object. The abrasion damages the fibers, thereby decreasing the life of the rope. LCP fibers are particularly susceptible to this failure mechanism. A second mechanism is another consequence of abrasion. As rope fibers abrade each other during use, such as when the rope is bent under tension against a pulley or drum, heat is generated. This internal heat severely weakens the fibers. The fibers are seen to exhibit accelerated elongation rates or to break (i.e., creep rupture) under load. The UHMWPE fibers suffer from this mode of failure. Another mechanism is a consequence of compression of the rope or parts of the rope where the rope is pulled taught over a pulley, drum, or other object.",
        "Various solutions to address these problems have been explored. These attempts typically involve fiber material changes or construction changes. The use of new and stronger fibers is often examined as a way to improve rope life. One solution involves the utilization of multiple types of fibers in new configurations. That is, two or more types of fibers are combined to create a rope. The different type fibers can be combined in a specific manner so as to compensate for the shortcoming of each fiber type. An example of where a combination of two or more fibers can provide property benefits are improved resistance to creep and creep rupture (unlike a 100% UHMWPE rope) and improved resistance to self-abrasion (unlike a 100% LCP rope). All such ropes, however, still perform inadequately in some applications, failing due to one or more of the three above-mentioned mechanisms.",
        "Rope performance is determined to a large extent by the design of the most fundamental building block used to construct the rope, the bundle of fibers. This bundle may include different types of fibers. Improving bundle life generally improves the life of the rope. The bundles have value in applications less demanding than the heavy-duty ropes described above. Such applications include lifting, bundling, securing, and the like. Attempts have been made to combine fiber materials in such repeated stress applications. For example, UHMWPE fibers and high strength fibers, such as LCP fibers, have been blended to create a large diameter rope with better abrasion resistance, but they are still not as effective as desired.",
        "The abrasion resistance of ropes for elevators has been improved by utilizing high modulus synthetic fibers, impregnating one or more of the bundles with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) dispersion, or coating the fibers with PTFE powder. Typically such coatings wear off relatively quickly. Providing a jacket to the exterior of a rope or the individual bundles has also been shown to improve the rope life. Jackets add weight, bulk, and stiffness to the rope, however.",
        "Fiberglass and PTFE have been commingled in order to extend the life of fiberglass fibers. These fibers have been woven into fabrics. The resultant articles possess superior flex life and abrasion resistance compared to fiberglass fibers alone. Heat-meltable fluorine-containing resins have been combined with fibers, in particular with cotton-like material fibers. The resultant fiber has been used to create improved fabrics. PTFE fibers have been used in combination with other fibers in dental floss and other low-load applications, but not in repeated stress applications described herein.",
        "In sum, none of the known attempts to improve the life of ropes or cable have provided sufficient durability in applications involving both bending and high tension. The ideal solution would benefit both heavy-duty ropes and smaller diameter configurations, such as bundles.",
        "The present invention provides a composite bundle for repeated stress applications comprising at least one high strength fiber, and at least one fluoropolymer fiber, wherein the fluoropolymer fiber is present in an amount of about 40% by weight or less.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, the high strength fiber is liquid crystal polymer or ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene, or combinations thereof.",
        "Preferred weight percentages of the fluoropolymer fiber are about 35% by weight or less, about 30% by weight or less, about 25% by weight or less, about 20% by weight or less, about 15% by weight or less, about 10% by weight or less, and about 5% by weight or less.",
        "Preferably, the composite bundle has a ratio of break strengths after abrasion test of at least 1.8, even more preferably of at least 3.8, and even more preferably of at least 4.0. Preferably, the fluoropolymer fiber is an ePTFE fiber, which may be a monofilament or multifilament, either of which can be low or high density.",
        "In alternative embodiments, the fluoropolymer fiber comprises a filler such as molybdenum disulfide, graphite, or lubricant (hydrocarbon, or silicone base fluid).",
        "In alternative embodiments, the high strength fiber is para-aramid, liquid crystal polyester, polybenzoxazole (PBO), high tenacity metal, high tenacity mineral, or carbon fiber.",
        "In another aspect, the invention provides for a method of reducing abrasion- or friction-related wear of a fiber bundle in repeated stress applications while substantially maintaining the strength of the fiber bundle comprising the step of including in the fiber bundle at least one filament of fluoropolymer.",
        "In other aspects, the invention provides a rope, belt, net, sling, cable, woven fabric, nonwoven fabric, or tubular textile made from the inventive composite bundle.",
        "In still another aspect, this invention provides ropes comprising high strength fibers with significantly enhanced fatigue performance through the preferred positioning of low friction fibers at or near the surface of bundles or bundle groups in both lay and braid ropes. In this aspect, the invention provides a rope having a plurality of bundle groups, each of the bundle groups having a periphery and comprising a plurality of high strength fibers, the rope having at least one low coefficient of friction fiber disposed around at least a portion of the periphery of one of the bundle groups. Preferably, there are a plurality of low coefficient of friction fibers disposed around at least a portion of said periphery of the bundle groups. The low coefficient of friction fibers include fluoropolymers (preferably expanded PTFE), polyethylene, polypropylene polyethylenechlorotrifluorethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polychlorotrifluoroethylene, polyvinyl fluoride, polyvinylidene fluoride, polytrifluoroethylene, blends, and copolymers.",
        "The invention also provides a bundle group for use in a rope having a periphery and a plurality of high strength fibers and at least one low coefficient of friction fiber disposed around at least a portion of the periphery of one of the bundle groups.",
        "Finally, the invention also provides a method of making a rope having a plurality of bundle groups including the step of disposing around at least one of the bundle groups a low coefficient of friction fiber.",
        "FIG. 1 is an exploded view of an exemplary embodiment of a rope made according to the present invention.",

        "FIG. 6 is a front view of a Holly Board used to produce a rope according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.",
        "The inventors have discovered that a relatively small weight percent of a fluoropolymer fiber added to a bundle of high strength fibers produces a surprisingly dramatic increase in abrasion resistance and wear life.",
        "The high-strength fibers used to form ropes, cables, and other tensile members for use in repeated stress applications include ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) such as DYNEEMA\u00ae and SPECTRA\u00ae brand fibers, liquid crystal polymer (LCP) fibers such as those sold under the tradename VECTRAN\u00ae, other LCAPs, PBO, high performance aramid fibers, para-aramid fibers such as Kevlar\u00ae fiber, carbon fiber, nylon, and steel. Combinations of such fibers are also included, such as UHMWPE and LCP, which is typically used for ropes in oceanographic and other heavy lifting applications.",
        "The fluoropolymer fibers used in combination with any of the above fibers according to preferred embodiments of the present invention include, but are not limited to, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (including expanded PTFE (ePTFE) and modified PTFE), fluorinated ethylenepropylene (FEP), ethylene-chlorotrif-luoroethylene (ECTFE), ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), or perfluoroalkoxy polymer (PFA). The fluoropolymer fibers include monofilament fibers, multifilament fibers, or both. Both high and low density fluoropolymer fibers may be used in this invention.",
        "Although the fluoropolymer fiber typically has less strength than the high-strength fiber, the overall strength of the combined bundle is not significantly compromised by the addition of the fluoropolymer fiber or fibers (or replacement of the high strength fibers with the fluoropolymer fiber or fibers). Preferably, less than 10% strength reduction is observed after inclusion of the fluoropolymer fibers.",
        "The fluoropolymer fibers are preferably combined with the high-strength fibers in an amount such that less than about 40% by weight of fluoropolymer fiber are present in the composite bundle. More preferable ranges include less than about 35% less than about 30%, less than about 25%, less than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 5%, and about 1%.",
        "Surprisingly, even at these low addition levels, and with only a moderate (less than about 10%) reduction in strength, the composite bundles of the present invention show a dramatic increase in abrasion resistance and thus in wear life. In some cases, the ratio of break strengths after abrasion tests has exceeded 4.0, as illustrated by the examples presented below (See Table 3). Specifically, as demonstrated in Examples 1-4 below, the break force of a fiber bundle including PTFE and a high-strength fiber after a given number of abrasion testing cycles are dramatically higher than that of the high-strength fiber alone. The abrasion rates, therefore, are lower for PTFE fiber-containing composite bundles than for the same constructions devoid of PTFE fibers.",
        "Without being limited by theory, it is believed that it is the lubricity of the fluoropolymer fibers that results in the improved abrasion resistance of the composite bundles. In this aspect, the invention provides a method of lubricating a rope or fiber bundle by including a solid lubricous fiber to it.",
        "The fluoropolymer fibers optionally include fillers. Solid lubricants such as graphite, waxes, or even fluid lubricants like hydrocarbon oils or silicone oils may be used. Such fillers impart additional favorable properties to the fluoropolymer fibers and ultimately to the rope itself. For example, PTFE filled with carbon has improved thermal conductivity and is useful to improve the heat resistance of the fiber and rope. This prevents or at least retards the build-up of heat in the rope, which is one of the contributing factors to rope failure. Graphite or other lubricious fillers may be used to enhance the lubrication benefits realized by adding the fluoropolymer fibers.",
        "Any conventionally known method may be used to combine the fluoropolymer fibers with the high-strength fibers. No special processing is required. The fibers may be blended, twisted, braided, or simply co-processed together with no special combination processing. Typically the fibers are combined using conventional rope manufacturing processes known to those skilled in the art.",
        "The inventors have also surprisingly found that not only does the addition of low friction polymer fibers to the synthetic rope greatly enhance fatigue life, but that the specific locations of low friction polymer fibers, tape and/or films within the rope can significantly impact the magnitude of this increase in fatigue life.",
        "Although blending of fluoropolymer fibers within ropes without particular attention to specific positioning within the rope significantly enhances fatigue life, the present inventors have discovered that specific positioning of the fluoropolymers within the rope structure offers the ability to even further enhance life.",
        "With specific reference to FIG. 4, an exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the invention is illustrated. Rope 40 comprises a plurality of bundle groups 41, each formed of bundles of fibers. Each bundle group 41 is wrapped with a low coefficient of friction fiber 42, preferably expanded PTFE. Although each bundle group 41 is wrapped with a low coefficient of friction fiber 42 in the illustrated embodiment, any number of the bundle groups 41 could be so wrapped according to the invention, provided that at least one bundle group 41 is so wrapped. Alternatively, the bundles themselves may be wrapped with low coefficient of friction fiber 42. The inventive rope may be made, for example using a Holly Board such as that illustrated in FIG. 6 according to methods known in the art.",
        "Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it appears that in enhancing fatigue life these low coefficient of friction fibers can work in a multiple of ways. This includes, but is not limited to, effectively providing a low friction wear resistant surface at key rope component interfaces, said low friction interfaces being key, while the form of the low friction material is less critical as long as the form provides persistence in the critical contact area.",
        "The examples included herein show clearly that fluoropolymer fibers may be used to construct the low friction interface; however, other forms of fluoropolymers such as tape, film, and the like are also part of this invention. Other polymeric materials having a low coefficient of friction that are capable of being placed in the preferred positions and are capable of persistence are also contemplated as effective routes to enhanced fatigue performance. Suitable low friction polymers include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbon polymers, halogen containing polymers, fluorine containing polymers, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylenechlorotrifluorethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polychlorotrifluoroethylene, polyvinyl fluoride, polyvinylidene fluoride, polytrifluoroethylene, blends, and copolymers, with fluorinated polymers being preferred and polytetrafluoroethylene being most preferred. The strongest fiber versions of the above polymers, with strength typically being attained by orienting the polymer in the longitudinal fiber direction, may have effective persistence under high stress conditions and therefore providing the most enhanced fatigue performance. Examples of these stronger fiber materials can be found in gel spun polyethylene and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. The low coefficient of friction fiber used herein is alternatively formed in a core-shell configuration, or is itself a composite material. It excludes woven materials however (i.e., the fiber is not part of a woven structure).",
        "Although again not wishing to be bound by theory, the low friction materials placed at key areas can act to reduce, delay, or eliminate heat generation, reduce, delay, or eliminate abrasion damage and reduce, delay, or eliminate the loss of strength in high strength fibers and rope elements that may accompany heat and abrasion and shear stresses. Reduction, delay, or elimination of compressive and shear induced damage in those high strength fibers known to be sensitive, such as in aramid fibers, is also a contemplated effect of this invention.",
        "Since the damaging effects of friction are a function of the magnitude of the normal stress of one bundle group against another, and since the low friction materials can also lead to adjustment of the shape of the bundle groups perpendicular to the normal stress such that the area of contact between the elements is increased, the normal stress is then decreased, and therefore the damaging effects of the friction are further mediated.",
        "Preferred locations for these low friction materials are at interfaces between elements within the rope that are in contact with each other and move or slide relative to one another when the rope is stressed or bent.",
        "These elements are defined in a hierarchical scheme within the rope structure starting at the fiber level where fibers may move relative to one another, the bundle level where bundles may move relative to one another, bundle group level where bundle groups may move relative to one another, and the rope itself, where the rope may move relative to itself in a crossover or relative to other ropes in a rope system.",
        "Since the amount of this low friction fiber, tape and/or film required to enhance life is minimal with respect to the volume or mass of the rope, the low friction polymer need not have high strength or modulus such that it contribute a priori to initial rope strength, a restriction that in the past has limited the choice of rope component fibers to a selection from very high strength fibers. Surprisingly, fibers that are not considered high strength fibers may be used to improve fatigue performance. The low friction sliding elements, created through placement of the low friction polymers at key locations, are better able to share load such that the tensile strength of the rope is typically higher than one would expect with the replacement of some high strength components with low strength fibers and components.",
        "Rope performance has historically been tuned with the use of coatings applied at the fiber, bundle, bundle group, or rope levels. Coatings formulated for abrasion resistance have been reported. Many of these coatings appear to reduce abrasion damage by acting as a lubricant, facilitating bending with less abrasion damage. These coatings are applied in liquid or powder form prior to, during, or after rope manufacture. Such coatings are expected to perform in concert with the subject invention, with the potential for significant enhancement of rope performance and life, especially in bending applications. The ropes of this invention are particularly useful in a deep sea hardware delivery systems.",
        "In the examples presented below, abrasion resistance and wear life are tested on various fiber bundles. The results are indicative of the effects seen in ropes constructed from the bundles of the present invention, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.",
        "Specifically, abrasion rate is used to demonstrate abrasion resistance. The wear life is demonstrated by certain examples in which the fiber bundles (with and without the inventive combination of fluoropolymer fibers) are cycled to failure. The results are reported as cycles to failure. More detail of the tests is provided below.",
        "Testing Methods",
        "Mass Per Unit Length and Tensile Strength Measurements",
        "The weight per unit length of each individual fiber was determined by weighing a 9 m length sample of the fiber using a Denver Instruments. Inc. Model AA160 analytical balance and multiplying the mass, expressed in grams, by 1000 thereby expressing results in the units of denier. With the exception of Examples 6a and 6b, all tensile testing was conducted at ambient temperature on a tensile test machine (Zellweger USTER\u00ae TENSORAPID 4, Uster, Switzerland) equipped with pneumatic fiber grips, utilizing a gauge length of 350 mm and a cross-head speed of 330 mm/min. The strain rate, therefore, was 94.3%/min. For Examples 6a and 6b, tensile testing was conducted at ambient temperature on an INSTRON 5567 tensile test machine (Canton, Mass.) equipped with pneumatic horseshoe fiber grips, again utilizing a gauge length of 350 mm, a cross-head speed of 330 mm/min and, hence, a strain rate of 94.3%/min. The peak force, which refers to the break strength of the fiber, was recorded. Four samples were tested and their average break strength was calculated. The average tenacity of the individual fiber sample expressed in g/d was calculated by dividing the average break strength expressed in grams by the denier value of the individual fiber. In the case of testing composite bundles or bundle groups, the average tenacity of these samples was calculated by dividing the average break strength of the composite bundle or bundle group (in units of grams), by the weight per length value of the composite bundle or bundle group (expressed in units of denier). The denier value of the composite bundle or bundle group can be determined by measuring the mass of the sample or by summing the denier values of the individual components of the sample.",
        "Density Measurement",
        "Fiber density was determined using the following technique. The fiber volume was calculated from the average thickness and width values of a fixed length of fiber and the density calculated from the fiber volume and mass of the fiber. A 2-meter length of fiber was placed on an A&D FR-300 balance and the mass noted in grams (C). The thickness of the fiber sample was then measured at 3 points along the fiber using an AMES (Waltham, Mass., USA) Model LG3600 thickness gauge. The width of the fiber was also measured at 3 points along the same fiber sample using an LP-6 Profile Projector available from Ehrenreich Photo Optical Ind. Inc. Garden City, N.Y. Average values of thickness and width were then calculated and the volume of the fiber sample was determined (D). The density of the fiber sample was calculated as follows:\n\nfiber sample density (g/cc)=C/D.\n\nAbrasion Resistance Measurement",
        "The abrasion test was adapted from ASTM Standard Test Method for Wet and Dry Yarn-on-Yarn Abrasion Resistance (Designation D 6611-00). This test method applies to the testing of yarns used in the construction of ropes, in particular, in ropes intended for use in marine environments.",
        "The test apparatus is shown in FIG. 2 with three pulleys 21, 22, 23 arranged on a vertical frame 24. Pulleys 21, 22, 23 were 22.5 mm in diameter. The centerlines of upper pulleys 21, 23 were separated by a distance of 140 mm. The centerline of the lower pulley 22 was 254 mm below a horizontal line connecting the upper pulley 21, 23 centerlines. A motor 25 and crank 26 were positioned as indicated in FIG. 2. An extension rod 27 driven by the motor-driven crank 26 through a bushing 28 was employed to displace the test sample 30 a distance of 50.8 mm as the rod 27 moved forward and back during each cycle. A cycle comprised a forward and back stroke. A digital counter (not shown) recorded the number of cycles. The crank speed was adjustable within the range of 65 and 100 cycles per minute.",
        "A weight 31 (in the form of a plastic container into which various weights could be added) was tied to one end of sample 30 in order to apply a prescribed tension corresponding to 1.5% of the average break strength of the test sample 30. The sample 30, while under no tension, was threaded over the third pulley 23, under the second pulley 22, and then over the first pulley 21, in accordance with FIG. 2. Tension was then applied to the sample 30 by hanging the weight 31 as shown in the figure. The other end of the sample 30 was then affixed to the extension rod 27 attached to the motor crank 26. The rod 27 had previously been positioned to the highest point of the stroke, thereby ensuring that the weight 31 providing the tension was positioned at the maximum height prior to testing. The maximum height was typically 6-8 cm below the centerline of the third pulley 23. Care was taken to ensure that the fiber sample 30 was securely attached to the extension rod 27 and weight 31 in order to prevent slippage during testing.",
        "The test sample 30 while still under tension was then carefully removed from the second, lower, pulley 22. A cylinder (not shown) of approximately 27 mm diameter was placed in the cradle formed by the sample 30 and then turned 180\u00b0 to the right in order to effect a half-wrap to the sample 30. The cylinder was turned an additional 180\u00b0 to the right to complete a full 360\u00b0 wrap. The twisting was continued in 180\u00b0 increments until the desired number of wraps was achieved. The cylinder was then carefully removed while the sample 30 was still under tension and the sample 30 was replaced around the second pulley 22. By way of example, three complete wraps (3\u00d7360\u00b0) for a fiber sample 30 is shown in FIG. 3. The only deviation from the twist direction during wrapping would arise in the case of the sample being a twisted multifilament. In this case, the direction of this twist direction must be in the same direction as the inherent twist of the multifilament fiber.",
        "In tests in which the test sample consists of two or more individual fibers, including at least one fiber of fluoropolymer, the following modified procedure was followed. After securing the test sample to the weight, the fluoropolymer fiber or fibers were placed side by side to the other fibers without twisting. Unless stated otherwise, the fluoropolymer fiber or fibers were always placed closest to the operator. The subsequent procedure for wrapping the fibers was otherwise identical to that outlined above.",
        "Once the test setup was completed, the cycle counter was set to zero, the crank speed was adjusted to the desired speed, and the gear motor was started. After the desired number of cycles was completed, the gear motor was stopped and the abraded test sample was removed from the weight and the extension rod. Each test was performed four times.",
        "The abraded test samples were then tensile tested for break strength and the results were averaged. The average tenacity was calculated using the average break strength value and the total weight per unit length value of the fiber or composite bundle sample.",

The peak force, which refers to the break strength of the fiber, was recorded. Four samples were tested and their average break strength was calculated.

The fiber volume was calculated from the average thickness and width values of a fixed length of fiber and the density calculated from the fiber volume and mass of the fiber. A 2 meter length of fiber was placed on an A&D FR-300 balance and the mass noted in grams (C). The thickness of the fiber sample was then measured at 3 points along the fiber using an AMES (Waltham, Mass., USA) Model LG3600 thickness gauge. The width of the fiber was also measured at 3 points along the same fiber sample using an LP-6 Profile Projector available from Ehrenreich Photo Optical Ind. Inc. Garden City, N.Y.

        "Single fibers of both fiber types were combined as described in Example 2. The weight percentages of these two fibers when combined were 79% UHMWPE and 21% ETFE. The weight per unit length of the composite bundle was 1998 d. The break force of the composite bundle was 50.44 kg. The tenacity of the composite bundle was 25.2 g/d. Adding the single ETFE fiber to the UHMWPE changed the weight per unit length, break force, and tenacity by +26%, \u22121%, and \u221221%, respectively.",
        "The test method and results of abrasion testing a single UHMWPE fiber were reported in Example 2a. The composite bundle of the UHMWPE fiber and the ETFE multifilament fluoropolymer fiber was also tested for abrasion resistance in the same manner. Three complete wraps were applied to the composite bundle. The test was conducted at 65 cycles per minute and under 757 g tension (which corresponded to 1.5% of the break force of the fiber combination).",
        "The abrasion tests were run for 500 cycles, after which point the abraded test samples were tensile tested to determine their break force. The composite bundle and the UHMWPE fiber exhibited 27.87 kg and 10.9 kg break forces after abrasion, respectively. Thus, adding the single ETFE multifilament fiber changed the break force by \u22121% prior to testing and resulted in a 156% higher break force upon completion of the abrasion test. The abrasion rates for the UHMWPE fiber alone and the composite bundle of the UHMWPE fiber and the ETFE multifilament fiber were 79.80 g/cycle and 45.14 g/cycle, respectively.",
        "In summary, the above examples demonstrate certain embodiments of the present invention, specifically:\n\n    Examples 1-3 demonstrate the combination of a single ePTFE fiber with a single fiber of each of the three major high strength fibers;\n    Example 2 also compares monofilament and multifilament ePTFE fibers.\n    Example 4 demonstrates the effect of combining a graphite-filled ePTFE monofilament fiber with a single UHMWPE fiber.\n    Example 5 demonstrates the performance of a three-fiber construction, as is used in making a rope; the abrasion test was conducted until failure.\n    Example 6 demonstrates the effects of varying the amount of monofilament ePTFE fiber in a two-fiber construction (varying the number of ePTFE fibers and combining them with three UHMWPE fibers).\n    Example 7 demonstrates the effect of using a lower density monofilament ePTFE fiber [to compare with Examples 2a-b and Examples 6a-b].\n    Example 8 demonstrates the effect of using a low tenacity, non-expanded PTFE fiber with a UHMWPE fiber.\n    Example 9 demonstrates the use of an alternative fluoropolymer.\n\nThese results are summarized in the following tables.",
