        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "This invention relates to prosthetic vascular access grafts. More particularly, this invention relates to multilayer composite vascular access grafts and their method of construction.",
        "2. Description of the State of the Art",
        "Vascular access is the method used to access the bloodstream for hemodialysis patients. Hemodialysis removes blood from the body and routes it to an artificial kidney machine where the blood is cleansed and returned to the patient. Hemodialysis patients require easy and routine access to the bloodstream. The most common forms of vascular access are an arteriovenous (A/V) fistula, a central venous catheter (CVC) for temporary access and a prosthetic vascular access graft (VAG). The A/V fistula generally takes 1 to 4 months after surgery to develop, and a CVC is generally inserted until the fistula is ready for use. A VAG is a synthetic tube that is implanted under the skin in your arm and connected to an artery and a vein. The VAG is the most widely used vascular access device for long term vascular access in the hemodialysis patient, since there are a variety of factors that prevent the use of an A/V fistula. More than 60% of the hemodialysis patients in the United States have a VAG.",
        "Hemodialysis patients have benefited from high-flow cannulation VAGs for decades. A primary material used in the construction of a VAG is expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). The ePTFE graft has become a standard among vascular surgeons due to its high kink-resistance, conformability and biocompatibility. The primary disadvantage of the ePTFE graft is that it must be allowed to \u201cmature\u201d for at least two weeks after the implant procedure to ensure that sufficient tissue in-growth has occurred and, although not necessarily required, it is often hoped that cell endothelialization has occurred as well. This maturation time helps to provide hemostasis, long-term healing ability and patency to the graft.",
        "Polyurethane VAGs have been introduced into the U.S. marketplace over the past three years and are beneficial in that they are available for cannulation immediately after implant, are self-sealing, and as a result, provide rapid post-cannulation hemostasis. There are a number of disadvantages with these grafts including undesired handling characteristics that make it difficult for the surgeon to create an anastomosis, particularly with smaller blood vessels. In addition, the high elasticity of polyurethane can result in pulling and kinking in the region of the anastomosis. Accordingly, one of skill in the art in the field of VAGs would benefit from the introduction of a VAG with improved performance characteristics, which include handling characteristics such as ease of suturing, kink resistance and the ability to serve as a cannulation route soon after the implant procedure.",
        "Multilayer composite vascular access grafts and their methods of manufacture are provided. In one embodiment, the multilayer composite vascular access graft comprises a first layer, a second layer in contact with or positioned at a distance from the first layer to form a horizontally aligned composite layer, and a conjoining layer disposed on the composite layer to conjoin the first layer to the second layer. The multilayer composite vascular access graft can further comprise a fiber-reinforced layer disposed on the conjoining layer. In another embodiment, the multilayer composite vascular access graft comprises a first layer, a second layer and a fiber-reinforced layer. The second layer is deposited on the first layer, and the second layer is coated with a fiber-reinforced layer.",

        "As discussed in more detail below, the invention generally includes a multilayer composite vascular access graft (mcVAG) and a method of constructing such a graft. The mcVAG includes a combination of materials that differ in their physical characteristics. The resulting vascular access graft has improved performance characteristics, which include desirable handling characteristics such as ease of suturing, kink resistance and the ability to serve as a cannulation route soon after the implant procedure.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates a cross-section of a mcVAG with a conjoined, composite inner layer according to one embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the mcVAG can be constructed according to any desired dimension and conformation and comprises a first inner layer component 101; a second inner layer component 102; a conjoining layer 103; an inner lumen 104; and, an optional fiber-reinforced layer 105. The first and second inner layer components 101 and 102 form what will be referred to as \u201ca composite inner layer,\u201d which may comprise any combination of components 101 and 102 and can be arranged in any order. The term \u201ccomposite inner layer 102, 101, 102\u201d will be used to refer to any variation of these components in a composite inner layer, including, for example, (i) a mcVAG with a composite inner layer 102, 101, which would have a first inner layer component 101 and a second inner layer component 102 at only one end of the mcVAG; and, (ii) a mcVAG with a composite inner layer 102, 101, 102, which would have a first inner layer component 101 and a second inner layer component 102 at each end of the mcVAG.",
        "The structural dimensions of the mcVAG can vary within the range of dimensions known to be useful to one of skill in the art. In some embodiments, the inner layer components 101 and 102, conjoining layer 103 and optional fiber-reinforced layer 105 can be uniform in thickness or variable in thickness throughout the layer. In other embodiments, a wall thickness 106 for first inner layer component 101 and the second inner layer component 102 can range from about 0.1 millimeter to about 1.0 millimeter, or any range therein. In another embodiment, the inner lumen 104 can have an inner diameter ranging from about 1.0 millimeter to about 30 millimeters, or any range therein. In one example, the inner lumen 104 can have an inner diameter ranging from about 5.0 millimeters to about 6.0 millimeters. In another embodiment, the length of the composite inner layer 102, 101, 102 can range from about 1.0 centimeters to about 100 centimeters, or any range therein. In one example, the length of the composite inner layer 102, 101, 102 can range from about 20 centimeters to about 50 centimeters. In another embodiment, there is a second inner layer component 102 at each end of the mcVAG, and the lengths of the second inner layer components are not equal.",
        "It should be appreciated that the mcVAG can be comprised of any number of layers and that each layer of the mcVAG can be formed by any method known to one of skill in the art. Each layer of the present invention can be either porous or non-porous. In one embodiment, the composite inner layer 102, 101, 102 can be porous and the conjoining layer 103 can be non-porous. In another embodiment, the composite inner layer 102, 101, 102 can be porous; the conjoining layer 103 can be non-porous; and, the fiber-reinforced layer 105 can be porous. In another embodiment, the composite inner layer 102, 101, 102 can be porous; the conjoining layer 103 can be non-porous; and, the fiber-reinforced layer 105 can be non-porous. In some embodiments, the layers are formed by coating or extrusion. Any method of coating can be used in practicing the present invention including, but not limited to, spraying, dipping, brushing, pouring, spinning, roller coating, meniscus coating, powder coating and various inking approaches such as inkjet-type application. In some embodiments, the method of coating is spraying. In other embodiments, the method of coating is dipping. A dipping method is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,409,172.",
        "Casting solvents may be required in the formation of each layer of the mcVAG. A casting solvent can be a liquid medium within which a desired solid material can be solubilized for application. The casting solvent must be carefully selected to avoid adversely affecting an underlying material such as, for example, the underlying first inner layer 101 and second inner layer 102. An underlying material should not be adversely affected where it is reasonably insoluble in a casting solvent used to apply an overlying layer. For purposes of the present invention, a material is reasonably insoluble in a casting solvent when, despite some solubility of the material in the solvent during casting, the product can still be used for its intended purpose. It should be appreciated, however, that the contact between layers can include an integration of an overlying layer with the underlying layer. The integration involves a reduction or elimination of the line of demarcation between layers without adversely affecting either layer. Casting solvents can be selected to achieve an integration of layers.",
        "The casting solvent may be chosen based on several criteria including, for example, its polarity, molecular weight, biocompatibility, reactivity and purity. Other physical characteristics of the casting solvent may also be taken into account, including the solubility limit of the conjoining layer 103 in the casting solvent; oxygen and other gases in the casting solvent; the viscosity and vapor pressure of the combined casting solvent and conjoining layer 103; the ability of the casting solvent to diffuse through an underlying material; and the thermal stability of the casting solvent. One of skill in the art has access to scientific literature and data regarding the solubility of a wide variety of polymers. Furthermore, one of skill in the art will appreciate that the choice of casting solvent may begin empirically by calculating the Gibb's free energy of dissolution using available thermodynamic data. It should be appreciated that the curing process may affect the chemical structure of the underlying materials and, thus, their solubility in the casting solvent. It should also be appreciated that the kinetics of dissolution are also a factor to consider when selecting the casting solvent, because a slow dissolution of a material may not affect the performance characteristics of a product due to a relatively fast processing time. Exemplary casting solvents for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, dimethyl acetamide (DMAC) and tetrahydrofuran (THF).",
        "In one example, the materials used to form the first inner layer component 101 and the second inner layer component 102 may both be soluble in a highly polar casting solvent such as, for example, water, but may be reasonably insoluble in a lower polarity casting solvent such as, for example, butanol. In this example, a low polarity casting solvent can be used for depositing the conjoining layer 103 on the composite inner layer 102, 101, 102 without disrupting the structure of first inner layer component 101 or second inner layer component 102 to an extent great enough to prevent them from being used for their intended purpose of serving as a composite inner layer 102, 101, 102 within a mcVAG.",
        "Each layer can be applied as liquid coating and dried to produce a solid coating. The drying process may be limited to drying without structural chemical changes in the material used to form the coating product, and it may also include curing. Regardless, the solid product is a relatively stable and inert material with all its performance properties intact. Some materials dry under ambient conditions without the aid of any additional process conditions. Other materials dry during treatment with steam or heating in an oven. Many polyester resins require a post-curing processes, which may include a heating-cooling cycle to increase the extent of the cure. Examples of process conditions used to properly dry a material include, but are not limited to, heat, electromagnetic radiation, electron beam, ion or charged particle beam, neutral-atom beam, chemical energy or a combination thereof. The electromagnetic radiation may include light and can be broadband or specific wavelengths. In one embodiment, the drying can occur under ambient conditions without additional application of heat, electromagnetic radiation, electron beam, ion or charged particle beam, neutral-atom beam, or chemical energy.",
        "In one embodiment, the first inner layer component 101 can be formed by coating a mandrel 201 with a polymer or combination of polymers, in a form that is blended, mixed, bonded or connected. For example, polyurethane can be used to form a first inner layer component 101 in the shape of the mandrel 201. In another embodiment, the second inner layer component 102 can be formed, for example, using ePTFE and extrusion techniques that are well-known by one of skill in the art. Essentially, an extruded PTFE is expanded to form an ePTFE second inner layer component 102. Process parameters can be controlled to alter the characteristics of the ePTFE, and such process parameters include, but are not limited to, rate of expansion, deformation level, and temperature. These process parameters can be varied in order to control structural features such as, for example, the microporous structure of the ePTFE tube. Examples of microporous structural features that affect the performance characteristics of the mcVAG include, but are not limited to, fibril orientation and node size. Methods for creating ePTFE tubes with desired characteristics, including multilayer tubes, are taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,428,571.",
        "FIGS. 2a-2c illustrate a method of depositing a conjoining layer in the construction of a mcVAG with a conjoined, composite inner layer according to one embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 2a, the first inner layer component 101 is formed on a mandrel 201 by dipping the mandrel 201 into a vat of first inner layer component 101, drying first inner layer component 101 and trimming first inner layer component 101 at both ends to produce clean edges. Examples of materials that may be used in the formation of the first inner layer component 101 include, but are not limited to, silicones; silicone rubbers; synthetic rubbers; polyethers; polyesters; polyolefins; modified polyolefins such as, for example, halogenated polyolefins that include, but are not limited to, fluorinated polyolefins; polyamides; fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer (FEP); polyfluorinated alkanoate (PFA); polyurethanes; segmented-polyurethanes; segmented polyether-polyurethanes; polyurethaneurea; silicone-polyurethane copolymers; and, any analogs, homologues, congeners, derivatives, salts and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the first inner layer component 101 can be comprised of polyurethane. In another embodiment, the first inner layer component 101 can be comprised of Thoralon\u00ae (Thoratec Corp.) The two major components in Thoralon\u00ae are surface modifying additives and BPS-215 polyurethaneurea, a high-flex-life elastomer. In any embodiment of the present invention, a salt of a polymer can be added for a variety of reasons such as, for example, to provide solubility, conductivity or reactivity.",
        "It is to be appreciated that a mandrel may not be necessary in the construction of a mcVAG of the present invention. However, where a mandrel 201 is used, it should be comprised of materials that are not substantially altered by the chosen process variables such that the mandrel 201 can still be used for its intended purpose. Relevant process variables include, but are not limited to, choice of casting solvents and methods of drying. Furthermore, the mandrel 201 should not be comprised of a material that will adhere or bond to the first inner layer component 101 or second inner layer component 102. The mandrel 201 can be comprised of any material or a combination of materials known to one of skill in the art to be useful in the formation of polymeric layers. In one embodiment, the mandrel comprises stainless steel. In another embodiment, the mandrel comprises glass. In another embodiment, the mandrel comprises wax. The surface properties of the mandrel 201 can also be chemically or physically altered to produce a desired outcome such as, for example, a reduction in surface adhesion or formation of a textured surface on the inner lumen 104.",
        "In FIG. 2b, the second inner layer components 102 are slipped onto both ends of the mandrel 201 until they communicate with the first inner layer component 101 to form a composite inner layer 102, 101, 102. Examples of materials that may be used in the formation of the second inner layer component 102 include, but are not limited to, silicones; silicone rubbers; synthetic rubbers; polyethers; polyesters; polyolefins; modified polyolefins such as, for example, halogenated polyolefins that include, but are not limited to, fluorinated polyolefins; polyamides; FEP; PFA; polyurethanes; segmented-polyurethanes; segmented polyether-polyurethanes; polyurethaneurea; silicone-polyurethane copolymers; and, any analogs, homologues, congeners, derivatives, salts and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the second inner layer component 102 can be comprised of PTFE. In another embodiment, the second inner layer component 102 can be comprised of ePTFE. A common type of PTFE is Teflon\u00ae (DuPont, Inc.), and common types of ePTFE are Gore-Tex\u00ae (W.L. Gore and Assoc., Inc.) and SoftForm\u00ae (EZX Corp.). Both PTFE and ePTFE are biologically inert, non-biodegradable, typically softer than implants comprising silicone and can be manufactured in many forms including, but not limited to, sheets, strands and tubes. The ePTFE is well-suited for a vascular access graft because it is a woven mesh-like form of PTFE that is flexible, soft, strong and sufficiently porous to allow for integration of body tissue within the ePTFE structure. In another embodiment, there is only one second inner layer component 102. In another embodiment, there is a second inner layer component 102 at each end of the mcVAG, and the lengths of the second inner layer components are not equal.",
        "The communicating between the first inner layer component 101 and the second inner layer component 102 includes, but is not limited to, abutting, overlapping or placing in close proximity. In the composite inner layer 102, 101, 102, the first inner layer component 101 communicates with the second inner layer components 102 such that the first inner layer component 101 and the second inner layer components 102 form an inner lumen 104 that is continuous.",
        "The first inner layer component 101 and the second inner layer component 102 are preferably porous. While not intending to be bound by any theory or mechanism of action, the inner lumen 104 is a blood interface that can eventually develop a biologic lining composed of platelets, endothelial-like cells, macrophages and lymphocytes. As a result, the inner lumen 104 can comprise a biologic pseudointima that makes use of an anticoagulant typically unnecessary. Accordingly, the mcVAG can be designed such that the inner lumen 104 has a structure that promotes endothelialization to prevent or inhibit thrombus formation.",
        "Endothelialization can be promoted by creating a porous or rough surface on the inner lumen 104. An average pore diameter sufficient to promote endothelialization can range from 1 micron to about 400 microns, from about 2 microns to about 200 microns, from about 4 microns to about 100 microns, from about 8 microns to about 80 microns, from about 10 microns to about 20 microns, or any range therein. In another embodiment, the inner lumen 104 has a rough surface comprising, for example, pits, grooves, flutes, fibrils, protuberances or a combination thereof. The intersections where fibrils meet are termed \u201cnodes,\u201d and the distance between nodes is termed the \u201cinternodal distance.\u201d The internodal distance can range from about 40 microns to about 200 microns, from about 50 microns to about 100 microns, from about 60 microns to about 75 microns, or any range therein. In some embodiments, nodes are only present in the first inner layer component 101.",
        "Porosity can be introduced into the layers of the present invention by any method known to one of skill in the art. In one embodiment, the porosity can be introduced into the layers by adding particles to the materials used to form the layers. For example, the first inner layer component 101 and second inner layer component 102 can be made porous by adding particles to the material, forming the layer, and then removing the particles to create porous structures. In some embodiments, the porous structure is present only in the first inner layer component 101. Pore size can be controlled by screening the particles according to size and adding particles of a predetermined size to the materials. The particles may include, but are not limited to, salts and water-soluble polymers. In some embodiments, water-soluble polymers include, for example, polymeric salts, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, dextran, and combinations thereof. Such particles may be removed, for example, by washing in water or a very dilute acid bath. Examples of non-polymeric salts include, but are not limited to, NaCl and sodium bicarbonate (bicarb). In other embodiments, the methods of forming the porous structure include stretching the first inner layer component 101 and the second inner layer component 102 to induce formation of pores or voids in the material. In one example, the first inner layer component 101 and the second inner layer component 102 can be formed to a predetermined smaller size and stretched to a necessary dimension. In other embodiments, the methods of forming the porous structure include precipitation of a cast polymer solution in an aqueous liquid such as, for example, water, prior to curing. In other embodiments, the methods of forming the porous structure include pressuring and sintering a powder of a polymer such as, for example, PTFE to form a film with internal bridging that may be stretched to control the size of the pore structure created; and, bombardment of a polymer film with high-energy particles followed by chemical etching to create a pore structure.",
        "In some embodiments, a layer is \u201cporous\u201d when it has a void-to-volume percentage that ranges from about 40% to about 90%, from about 70% to about 80%, or any range therein. In some embodiments, a layer is \u201cnon-porous\u201d when it has a void-to-volume percentage that ranges from about 0% to about 5%, from about 1% to about 3%, and any range therein. The \u201cvoid-to-volume percentage\u201d is defined as the volume of the pores divided by the total volume of the layer including the volume of the pores. In some embodiments, the void-to-volume percentage can be measured using standard test method BSR/AAMI/ISO 7198, which has been adopted in-whole as a revision of ANSI/AAMI VP20-1994 (Cardiovascular Implants\u2014Vascular Prosthesis section 8.2.1.2, Method for Gravimetric Determination of Porosity, Am. Nat'l Stds. Inst./Assoc. for the Adv. of Med. Instr.)",
        "The layers of the mcVAG may also be at least partially coated with an antiplatelet, anticoagulant, antifibrin, antithrombin, or a combination thereof, to prevent or inhibit thrombus formation. Examples of antiplatelets, anticoagulants, antifibrins and antithrombins include, but are not limited to, albumin, gelatin, glycoproteins, heparin, hirudin, recombinant hirudin, argatroban, forskolin, vapiprost, prostacyclin, dextran, D-phe-pro-arg-chloromethylketone (synthetic antithrombin), dipyridamole, platelet receptor antagonist glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antibodies such as 7E-3B, thrombin inhibitors such as ANGIOMAX (Biogen, Inc.), and any analogs, homologues, congeners, derivatives, salts and combinations thereof.",
        "In some embodiments, the inner lumen 104 can act as a scaffolding for host cells comprising nucleic acids encoding for polypeptides that are antithrombogenic. In another embodiment, the inner lumen 104 can be surface-modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG). For example, a PEG-diisocyanate with a molecular weight of about 3400 daltons may potentially react with protein amines to form molecular barriers on adsorbed proteins on inner lumen 104 to prevent or inhibit the attachment of adhesive ligands and formation of acute surface thrombosis. In other embodiments, surface treatments including, but not limited to, plasma treatment, corona discharge, flame treatment, thermal treatment, chromic acid etching, and sodium treatment may be used to control surface properties such as, for example, the surface tension or reactivity of a polymer surface and to potentially introduce functional groups such as, for example, hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, sulfoxyl, aldehyde, hydroperoxide, ether, ester, amino and amido groups.",
        "In FIG. 2c, the conjoining layer 103 is deposited on a segment of the composite inner layer 102, 101, 102.

The conjoining layer 103 is then deposited on the masked composite inner layer 102, 101, 102 to conjoin the first inner layer component 101 to the second inner layer components 102 and form an inner lumen 104 that is continuous and sealed. In one embodiment, the portions 203 can range from about 0.05 inches to about 12 inches in length, from about 0.1 inches to about 6 inches in length, from about 0.2 inches to about 3 inches in length, from about 0.25 inches to about 0.75 inch in length, or any range therein.",
        "The method used for depositing the conjoining layer 103 on the composite inner layer 102, 101, 102 depends on whether conjoining layer 103 was preformed prior to the depositing. As described above, the conjoining layer 103 can be preformed, for example, through an extrusion process or on a mandrel 201, or it can be applied directly as a liquid coating on the composite inner layer 103. In one embodiment, the conjoining layer 103 can be a preformed tubular material that is expanded and placed on a composite inner layer 102, 101, 102 on a mandrel 201. In another embodiment, the conjoining layer 103 can be a liquid that is sprayed on a composite inner layer 102, 101, 102 on a mandrel 201 and dried under ambient conditions. In another embodiment, the composite inner layer 102, 101, 102 can be dipped into a vat of liquid conjoining layer 103, and the conjoining layer 103 can be dried with any method described above.",
        "The mask 202 should be comprised of a material that is reasonably insoluble in the casting solvent used to deposit the conjoining layer 103. In some embodiments, the mask 202 can be easily removed with a solvent that will not adversely affect other materials in the mcVAG. These embodiments may require the use of such a solvent, because the mask 202 can sometimes unavoidably adhere to the composite inner layer 102, 101, 102. For example, if the casting solvent used to deposit the conjoining layer 103 is DMAC, then the mask 202 should be reasonably insoluble in DMAC. Likewise, if the casting solvent is THF, then the mask 202 should be reasonably insoluble in THF. In one embodiment, the mask 202 can be a layer of salt that was applied to the composite inner layer 102, 101, 102 as a supersaturated solution. A variety of salts may be used as the mask 202 and removed with either water or a weak acid. In one example, the mask 202 comprises NaCl, which may be easily removed with water after depositing the conjoining layer 103 and is reasonably insoluble in a DMAC casting solvent. In another embodiment, the mask 202 can be made from a water-soluble polymer. In some embodiments, water-soluble polymers may include, for example, polymeric salts, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, dextran, and combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the mask 202 can be made from a material that may not be easily removable by a solvent and, thus, requires removal by applying force without additional application of a solvent. Examples of such masks 202 include, but are not limited to, metals and metal alloys such as, for example, aluminum, stainless steel, gold, cured silicone, and the like.",
