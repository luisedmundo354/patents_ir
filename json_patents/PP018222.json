        "The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of carnation that is grown for use as a flowering plant for pots and containers. The new cultivar is known botanically as Dianthus\u00d7hybrida and will be referred to hereinafter by the cultivar name \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019.",
        "\u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 is a complex hybrid plant that is the product of a breeding program started by the inventor in 1980. The breeding program is ongoing, conducted in a cultivated area of Houndspool, Dawlish, Devon, United Kingdom. The primary focus of the breeding program is to produce new cultivars of carnations that exhibit unique growth habit. The inventor selected \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 in 2001 for its unique pronounced compact habit accompanied by abundant soft magenta flowers that bloom from May through October.",
        "\u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 is a dwarf carnation exhibiting pronounced compact habit, grey-green foliage, and soft magenta flowers. The colors of stems, leaves, calyx, and epicalyx are of material retaining the characteristic waxy bloom of Dianthus. \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 resulted from the open pollination between two unknown varieties of Dianthus.",
        "The variety of Dianthus which is considered by the inventor to most closely resemble \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 is the inventor's variety Dianthus \u2018Devon Winnie\u2019 (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 14,893). When compared with these two varieties, the vigor of \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 is greater than \u2018Devon Winnie\u2019. \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 exhibits a softer and more purple flower than \u2018Devon Winnie\u2019. \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 has a stronger perfume than the moderately perfumed \u2018Devon Winnie\u2019.",
        "Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar was first accomplished by the inventor in 2001 in a cultivated area of Houndspool, United Kingdom. The method of asexual propagation used was vegetative cuttings. Since that time the characteristics of the new cultivar have been determined stable and are reproduced true to type in successive generations of asexual reproduction.",
        "The following traits have been repeatedly observed and represent the characteristics of the new Dianthus cultivar \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019. These traits in combination distinguish this cultivar from all other commercial varieties known to the inventor. \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 has not been tested under all possible conditions and phenotypic differences may be observed with variations in environmental, climatic and cultural conditions, however, without any variance in genotype.\n\n    \n    \n        1. Dianthus \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 exhibits a pronounced compact habit.\n        2. Dianthus \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 blooms profusely.\n        3. Dianthus \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 exhibits soft magenta flowers from May through October.\n        4. Dianthus \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 exhibits grey-green foliage.\n        5. At maturity, the height of the foliage mound of Dianthus \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 is 15 cm-20 cm. The mature width is approximately 10 cm-15 cm.\n        6. Dianthus \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 is a perennial herb.\n        7. Dianthus \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 is suitable for use as a flowering plant in pots and containers.\n        8. Dianthus \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 is hardy to minus 15\u00b0 Centigrade.",
        "The accompanying color drawings illustrate the overall appearance of the new Dianthus variety \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019 showing colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the drawings may differ from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description, which accurately describe the actual colors of the new variety \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019.",
        "The drawing labeled as FIG. 1 depicts an entire flowering plant.",
        "The drawing labeled as FIG. 2 depicts a close-up view of the flower.",
        "All drawings were made from 12 months old plants which had been grown in 1.5-liter containers in a cold glasshouse in Devon, United Kingdom. No chemicals were used to treat the plants. All drawings were made using conventional techniques and although colors may appear different from actual colors due to light reflectance they are as accurate as possible by conventional photography.",
        "The following is a detailed description of the new cultivar \u2018DEVON ESTHER\u2019. Data was collected in spring from 1.5-liter container plants which had been grown for 12 months in an unheated greenhouse in Devon, United Kingdom. The color determinations are in accordance with the 2001 edition of The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart except where general color terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.
