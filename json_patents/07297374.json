    "description": [
        "This invention relates to polysilazane- or polysiloxazane-containing compositions useful in providing ceramic-based microstructures for, for example, high temperature electronics, telecommunications, and biological applications.",
        "Ceramic materials are well known and widely used for different applications due to some of their exceptional properties such as high modulus, hardness, high temperature stability and chemical resistance. However they are also heavy, brittle, and difficult to process. On the other hand, organic polymers are tough, flexible, light, and easy to fabricate; low modulus and relatively low decomposition temperatures are their main drawbacks. Pre-ceramic polymer technology is emerging as a promising process to produce materials that share the advantages of both polymers and ceramics while minimizing the disadvantages.",
        "Furthermore new methods are needed to create micron-size (or even smaller) ceramic structures for applications such as microelectronics and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). A particularly challenging area is creating three-dimensional (3D) ceramic structures. These application areas are very difficult using traditional ceramic technologies. Pre-ceramic polymers afford unique properties in responding to these requirements.",
        "Many polymers such as polysilazanes are known to act as ceramic precursors and their use for production of ceramic structures has been reported. The formation of miniaturized ceramic structures by pyrolysis of poly (vinylsilazane) using LIGA (German Lithographie, Galvanoformung, and Abformung) process including deep X-ray lithography, electroforming, and plastic molding has been demonstrated. An injectable polymer-precursor technique has been detailed; also a microforged mold method to fabricate high temperature MEMS using polysilazanes has been disclosed. All of the described techniques, however, involve complex and time-consuming processing.",
        "Photopolymerization provides an alternative route to construct solid microstructures. Photopolymerization techniques offers direct pattern formation capability, freestanding structures, and cost-effective processing. Through layer-by-layer processes such as stereolithography, photopolymerization techniques can also allow for the fabrication of 3-dimensional structures. Efforts have been made to create ceramic microstructures using free radial inititated photopolymerization of liquid polysilazane; low photopolymerization speed, however, was observed.",
        "Single-photon polymerization techniques have been used to form patterned pre-ceramic polymer microstructures using thiol-ene chemistry including polysilazanes. Two-photon polymerization of polymer nanocomposites has been used to pattern 3D silica microstructures.",
        "Briefly, the present invention provides a single- or multi-photon reactive composition comprising\n\n    \n    \n        a) a liquid polysilazane precursor,\n        b) a multifunctional acrylate additive, and\n        c) a single- or multi-photon photocuring composition.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a single or multi-photon reactive composition comprising\n\n    \n    \n        a) a liquid polysilazane precursor,\n        b) a multifunctional acrylate additive,\n        c) a single- or multi-photon photocuring composition preferably comprising one or both of\n        \n            i) a single-photon photocuring composition, and\n            ii) a multi-photon photocuring composition comprising at least one multi-photon photosensitizer, and optionally one or both of an electron acceptor and an electron donor.",
        "Preferably, the multi-photon photosensitizer has a two-photon cross-section at least 1.5 times that of fluorescein.",

        "This method is advantageous in that it enables three-dimensional (3D) microstructuring of polysilazane materials in a single exposure step. Also, the method provides a composition with improved multi-photon photosensitivity as well as higher crosslink density compared to compositions without multifunctional acrylate additives. The method produces ceramic microstructures without the need for molds and is especially useful for structures of complex topology. Also, by this method ceramic structures can be added to partially completed articles.",

        "This method is advantageous in that it provides a composition with improved single-photon photosensitivity, resulting in generally reduced manufacturing time. It also provides the advantages described above for the multi-photon reactive composition.",
        "In addition to a single-photon method of photoinitiating a polysilazane-containing/multi-functional acrylate-containing reactive composition the present invention provides a method of multi-photon photosensitizing a polysilazane-containing and multi-functional acrylate-containing photoreactive composition. The multi-photon method comprises irradiating (preferably, pulse irradiating) the composition with light sufficient to cause simultaneous absorption of at least two photons, thereby inducing at least one radical-initiated chemical reaction where the composition is exposed to light. The photoreactive composition comprises: (a) at least one polysilazane-containing and at least one multi-functional acrylate-containing reactive species that is capable of undergoing a radical-initiated chemical reaction (preferably, a curable species selected from the group consisting of monomers, oligomers, and reactive polymers); and (b) at least one multi-photon photocuring composition.",
        "The method of the invention provides enhanced multi-photon photosensitivity by combining (in photochemically-effective amounts) at least one multi-photon photosensitizer having a relatively large two-photon absorption cross section (compared to those of many commonly available dyes) with optionally one or both of an electron acceptor and an electron donor so as to efficiently form a polymerization-initiating species (radicals, etc.). The increased sensitivity of the method of the invention provides utility by, for example, allowing rapid fabrication of three-dimensional structures by means of three-dimensional light patterns and permitting the use of lower peak intensity lasers (including, for example, robust industrial lasers such sa nanosecond and picosecond Nd:YAG lasers) for exposure.",
        "It is believed novel in the art to produce patterned pre-ceramic microstructures by use of single- and multi-photon polymerization of polysilazane/multi-functional acrylate-containing receive compositions that are free of thiols, i.e., free of \u2014SH containing compounds. The multi-photon technology enables fabrication of hollow or solid, three-dimensional microstructures with submicron resolution in a single exposure/development cycle. Complex 3-D geometries can be fabricated that cannot be formed by other methods such as molding or powder pressing.",

        "Prior to exposure, the resulting photoreactive compositions can be coated on a substrate, if desired, by any of a variety of coating methods known to those skilled in the art (including, for example, knife coating and spin coating). The substrate can be, for example, a film, sheet, or other surface depending upon the particular application and the method of exposure to be utilized. Preferred substrates are generally sufficiently flat to enable the preparation of a layer of photoreactive composition having a uniform thickness. For applications where coating is less desirable, the photoreactive compositions can alternatively be exposed in bulk form. Following coating, the reactive composition can, optionally, be soft baked (for example on a hot plate or in an oven) to remove some or all of the residual solvent. The substrate can be made of any suitable material (e.g., glass, fused silica, silicon, calcium fluoride) and can be chosen from a wide variety of films, sheets, wafers, and other surfaces, depending upon the particular application and the method of exposure to be utilized. The substrate can optionally be pre-treated with a primer (for example, silane coupling agents) to enhance adhesion of the photoreactive composition to the substrate.",
        "Single-photon photoreactive compositions can be photopatterned using standard photolithography techniques such as contact or projection lithography (See for example W. Moreau, Semiconductor Lithography: Principles, Practices, and Materials (3rd Ed.), Plenum Press: New York, 1991). The light source can be any light source that produces actinic radiation (i.e., radiation capable of initiating a photoreaction process) and can, in practice, be any light source that provides sufficient intensity at a wavelength appropriate for the photoinitiator or photosensitizer used in the photoreactive composition. Such wavelengths are generally in the ultraviolet or visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and can be in the range of about 150 to about 800 nm; preferably, from about 200 to about 600 nm; more preferably, from about 240 to about 500 nm. Exposure times generally depend upon the type of exposure system used to cause image formation (and its accompanying variables such as numerical aperture, geometry of light intensity spatial distribution, and average light intensity), as well as upon the nature of the photoreactive composition exposed.",
        "Useful exposure systems for multi-photon curing include at least one light source (usually a pulsed laser) and at least one optical element. Suitable light sources include, for example, femtosecond near-infrared titanium sapphire oscillators (for example, a Coherent Mira Optima 900-F, Santa Clara, Calif.) pumped by an argon ion laser (for example, a Coherent Innova). This laser, operating at 76 MHz, has a pulse width of less than 200 fermtoseconds, is tunable between 700 and 980 nm, and has average power up to 1.4 Watts. However, in practice, any light source that provides sufficient intensity (to effect multi-photon absorption) at a wavelength appropriate for the photosensitizer (used in the photoreactive composition) can be utilized. (Such wavelengths can generally be in the range of about 300 to about 1500 nm; preferably, from about 600 to about 1100 nm; more preferably, from about 750 to about 850 nm. Peak intensities can generally range from at least about 106 W/cm2. The upper limit of the pulse fluence is generally dictated by the ablation threshold of the photoreactive composition.) For example, Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers (for example, a Spectra-Physics Quanta-Ray PRO, Mountain View, Calif.), visible wavelength dye lasers (for example, a Spectral-Physics Sirah pumped by a Spectra-Physics Quanta-Ray PRO), and Q-switched diode pumped lasers (for example, a Spectra-Physics FCbar\u2122) can also be utilized. Preferred light sources are near infrared pulsed lasers having a pulse length less than about 10\u22128 second (more preferably, less than about 10\u22129 second; most preferably, less than about 10\u221211 second). Other pulse lengths can be used provided that the above-detailed peak intensity and pulse fluence criteria are met.",
        "Optical elements useful in carrying out the method of the invention include refractive optical elements (for example, lenses and prisms), reflective optical elements (for example, retroreflectors or focusing mirrors), diffractive optical elements (for example, gratings, phase masks, and holograms), polarizing optical elements (for example, linear polarizers and waveplates), diffusers, Pockels cells, waveguides, waveplates, and birefringent liquid crystals, and the like. Such optical elements are useful for focusing, beam delivery, beam/mode shaping, pulse shaping, and pulse timing. Generally, combinations of optical elements can be utilized, and other appropriate combinations will be recognized by those skilled in the art. It is often desirable to use optics with large numerical aperture to provide highly-focused light. However, any combination of optical elements that provides a desired intensity profile (and spatial placement thereof) can be utilized. For example, the exposure system can include a scanning confocal microscope (BioRad MRC600, Thornwood, N.Y.) equipped with a 0.75 NA objective (Zeiss 20X Fluar, Carl Zeiss Micro Imaging, Inc., Thornwood, N.Y.).",
        "Generally, multi-photon exposure of the photoreactive composition can be carried out using a light source (as described above) along with an optical system as a means for controlling the three-dimensional spatial distribution of light intensity within the composition. For example, the light from a pulsed laser can be passed through a focusing lens in a manner such that the focal point is within the volume of the composition. The focal point can be scanned or translated in a three-dimensional pattern that corresponds to a desired shape, thereby creating a three-dimensional image of the desired shape. The exposed or illuminated volume of the composition can be scanned either by moving the composition itself or by moving the light source (for example, moving a laser beam using galvo-mirrors).",
        "If the light induces, for example, a reaction of the reactive species that produces a material having solubility characteristics different from those of the reactive species, the resulting image can optionally be developed by removing either the exposed or the unexposed regions through use of an appropriate solvent, for example, or by other art-known means. Cured, complex, three-dimensional objects can be prepared in this manner.",
        "Exposure times generally depend upon the type of exposure system used to cause image formation (and its accompanying variables such as numerical aperture, geometry of light intensity spatial distribution, the peak light intensity during the laser pulse (higher intensity and shorter pulse duration roughly correspond to peak light intensity)), as well as upon the nature of the composition exposed (and its concentrations of photosensitizer, photoinitiator, and electron donor compound). Generally, higher peak light intensity in the regions of focus allows shorter exposure times, everything else being equal. Linear imaging or \u201cwriting\u201d speeds generally can be about 5 to 100,000 microns/second using a laser pulse duration of about 10\u22128 to 10\u221215 second (preferably, about 10\u221211 to 10\u221214 second) and about 102 to 109 pulses per second (preferably, about 103 to 108 pulses per second).",
        "As disclosed in Assignee's U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0068023A1, filed Oct. 2, 2002, (the description of photopatterners of structures of which is incorporated herein by reference), the single or multi-photon reactive radiation induces a reaction in the reactive composition that produces a material having solubility characteristics different from those of the unexposed reactive composition. The resulting pattern of exposed and unexposed material can then be developed by removing either the exposed or the unexposed regions with an appropriate solvent. An optional post exposure bake following exposure but prior to development may be required for certain photoreactive compositions. Reacted, complex, seamless three-dimensional structures can be prepared in this manner.",
        "The resulting structures can have any suitable size and shape, but the method of the invention is particularly well suited for adding a microstructure to a microstructured surface of an article. The structures can be formed on the surface of the article, or within or on a feature of the surface.",
        "The photopatterned structure can be thermally treated (pyrolysis) to convert the pre-ceramic polymer to a ceramic material. Following the polymerization reaction, the resultant polymeric material is typically pyrolyzed to form the ceramic material. For example, depending on the conditions employed for the thermal treatment, amorphous or crystalline structures can be obtained. Amorphous structures are generally obtained particularly when the pyrolysis is carried out in a temperature range from about 700 to 1200\u00b0 C., preferably from 900 to 1200\u00b0 C. When the thermal treatment is carried out at higher temperatures, for instance from 1200 to 2000\u00b0 C., preferably from 1500 to 2000\u00b0 C., at least partially crystalline structures are typically obtained. Pyrolysis is typically carried out under a protective gas cover or a reaction gas cover (e.g., helium, argon, nitrogen, ammonia, etc.) or in a vacuum. Further, pyrolysis is typically performed for about 0.5 to 2 hours to convert the polymeric material to a ceramic material. Optionally, a ceramic material is subjected to additional processing following pyrolysis. For example, a stable body is typically obtained after a sintering procedure at temperatures of 900\u00b0 C. up to 2000\u00b0 C., preferably 1600-2000\u00b0 C., for 0.5 to 2 hours or more.",
        "After sintering, the structure has a substantially inorganic composition and dimensions that are smaller than prior to the sintering step.",
        "Representative applications for these higher temperature resistant materials include patterned ceramic devices such as microcombustors, micro-heat-exchangers, sensor and actuator systems, microfluidic devices, and micro-optics systems that can be used independently or integrated into other systems, such as microelectromechanical systems. Ceramics that can resist high temperatures are a good alternative to conventional polymeric material because of their superior thermal properties, corrosion and chemical resistance, high modulus, and hardness.",
        "Objects and advantages of this invention are further illustrated by the following examples, but the particular materials and amounts thereof recited in these examples, as well as other conditions and details, should not be construed to unduly limit this invention.",

No. 5,189,136 and triethyl phosphite (37.4 g) was heated to reflux for 6 hours. After cooling, the product was heated under high vacuum to remove residual triethyl phosphite. A thick oil was obtained which slowly crystallized after several days and was used without further purification in the following step. To a mixture of the thick oil (11.60 g), 4-diphenylaminobenzaldehyde (12.34 g), and dry tetrahydrofuran (400 mL) was added dropwise potassium t-butoxide (1.0 M in tetrahydrofuran, 44 mL). The mixture was stirred for 3 hours at room temperature, then the solvent was removed under vacuum. Water (100 mL) was added to the residue, and the mixture was extracted several times with methylene chloride. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using 30/70 methylene chloride/hexane to give 14.44 g of Dye 1, bis-[4-(diphenylamino)stryl]-1-(2-ethyhexyloxy),4-(methoxy)benzene, as a bright green solid.

        "Several drops of a mixture of VL20 (2.00 g), TMPTA (0.30 g), ITX (0.040 g), Dye 1 (0.011 g), and dichloromethane (0.26 g) were placed on each of three clean glass microscope slides between two strips of adhesive tape (SCOTCH 810 MAGIC TAPE, available from 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn.) that were adhered to each slide approximately 1 cm apart. Glass cover slips were then placed over each mixture. Two-photon polymerization was performed using a diode pumped Ti:sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics, Mountain View, Calif.) operating at a wavelength of 800 nm, nominal pulse width 45 fs, pulse repetition rate of 80 mHz, and beam diameter of approximately 1.5 mm. The optical train consisted of low dispersion turning mirrors, a beam expander, an optical attenuator to vary the optical power, an acousto-optic modulator as a shutter, and a computer controlled 2-axis (x-y axes) galvomirror scanning system mounted on a vertical z-axis stage. A 100X oil-immersion Plan Fluorite microscope objective (numerical aperture 1,4, available from Nikon Instruments, Inc., Melville, N.Y.) was used to focus the laser light into the sample. The position of the microscope objective was adjusted to set the focal point at the interface of the polymer composition and the glass slide. Under computer control, the focused laser was rastered to form a series of bars that were approximately 100 microns wide. The scan speed of the laser was varied from 0.67 mm per second to 43 mm per second and the average power of the laser was varied from approximately 7 mW to approximately 12 mW in order to determine the threshold writing speed as a function of average power. The threshold writing speed is the maximum scan speed at a given average power the provides a polymerized structure that remains intact following the development step described below. Following exposure of the samples to the laser, each sample was developed. Each glass slide was washed with acetone to remove unpolymerized poly(vinylsilazanes). After each glass slide was dried in air at room temperature, each was examined using an optical microscope. The data are given in Table 1.",

        "One side of a glass microscope slide was coated with NORLAND OPTICAL ADHESIVE 81 (available from Norland Products, Cranbury, N.J.) at a thickness of approximately 500 microns. The coating was irradiated through a shadow mask for 2 minutes using a light source comprising a Model 66001 lamp housing (available from Oriel Corp., Stratford, Conn.) and a Model USH-200DP lamp (available from USHIO America, Inc., Cypress, Calif.) that was approximately 4 inches (10 cm) from the coating. The sample was then developed by washing the slide in ethyl acetate to remove uncured adhesive. The sample was then dried in a stream of air for approximately 2 minutes to afford the glass slide with a pattern of cured adhesive on one side. A second glass slide was coated with 3M ESPE EXPRESS 7301 vinyl polysiloxane dental impression material (available from 3M ESPE, St. Paul, Minn.) and this slide was pressed against the slide on which the adhesive was cured so that the EXPRESS dental impression material was in contact with the cured adhesive. The slides were held pressed together for approximately 5 minutes to allow the dental impression material to cure, after which time the slides were separated. The cured dental impression material retained the inverse of the pattern of the cured adhesive and provided a mold for the next step. A mixture of VL20 (4.00 g), TMPTA (0.55 g), tetravinylsilane (1.00 g), platinum(II) acetylacetonate (0.02 g), IRGACURE 819 (0.01 g), dicumyl peroxide (0.04 g), and dichloromethane (5 drops) was poured onto the cured dental impression material on the glass slide to fill the pattern with the mixture. The mixture was irradiated with the Model USH-200DP lamp in the Oriel housing for 2 minutes. After the irradiation was stopped, the sample was allowed to stand at room temperature for approximately 3 hours. The dental impression material mold was carefully peeled off of the cured polysilazanes layer. The cured polysilazanes layer was pyrolyzed in air in a model 3-550 oven (available from Neytech, Bloomfield, Conn.) by heating at a rate of 10\u00b0 C. per minute to 600\u00b0 C. for 2 hours, then at 800\u00b0 C. for two hours, then at 1000\u00b0 C. for two hours. The oven containing the sample was allowed to cool to room temperature and the ceramic structure was removed. The ceramic structure produced was an accurate replication of the mold. Other useful ceramic structures can be produced using an inert pyrolysing atmosphere.",
