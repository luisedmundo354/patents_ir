        "The present invention relates to a non-aqueous electrolytic solution which imparts to lithium secondary batteries favorable battery performances in the electric capacity and the storage property and further in the battery cycle property, and further relates to a lithium secondary battery containing the same.",
        "At present, a lithium secondary battery is generally employed as an electric source for driving small electronic devices. The lithium secondary battery essentially comprises a positive electrode, a non-aqueous electrolytic solution, and a negative electrode. A lithium secondary battery utilizing a positive electrode of lithium compound oxide such as LiCoO2 and a negative electrode of carbonaceous material or lithium metal is preferably used. As the electrolytic solution for the lithium secondary battery, a carbonate such as ethylene carbonate (EC) or propylene carbonate (PC) is preferably used.",
        "Heretofore, there have been proposals to incorporate a variety of additives to a non-electrolytic solution so as to improve various performances of a lithium secondary battery.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 5,709,968 (corresponding to Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 9-50822) describes a number of compounds including p-fluoroanisole and 2,4-difluoroanisole to be used as additives for keeping a lithium secondary battery from over-charging.",
        "Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 11-329490 describes pentafluorobenzene derivatives in which the six hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring are replaced with five fluorine atoms and one substituted ester group, substituted acyl group or trifluoromethyl group, such as methyl pentafluorobenzenecarboxylate and octafluorotoluene, which are employable for improving the cycle performance of a lithium secondary battery.",
        "Further improvements of various lithium battery performances are desired. Particularly, the improvement of cycle performance (i.e., rate of retention of discharge capacity after repeated charging-discharging procedures) of a lithium secondary battery is highly desired.",
        "In a lithium secondary battery using LiCoO2, LiMn2O4 or LiNiO2 as the positive electrode material, a portion of a solvent of the non-aqueous electrolytic solution oxidatively decomposes in the course of charging, and the decomposition product disturbs the desired electrochemical reaction of the battery. Accordingly, the battery performances lower. It is assumed that this phenomenon arises from electrochemical oxidation of the solvent in contact with the surface of the positive electrode.",
        "On the other hand, in a lithium secondary battery using a highly crystalline carbonaceous material such as natural graphite or artificial graphite as the negative electrode material, the solvent in the non-aqueous electrolytic solution reductively decomposes on the surface of the negative electrode in the course of charging. The reductive decomposition occurs in a portion of the solvent in the repeated charging-discharging procedures even if the solvent contains EC (ethylene carbonate) which is generally employed as a solvent of the non-aqueous electrolytic solution, and hence the battery performances lower.",
        "For these reasons, the lithium secondary batteries still are not satisfactory in their battery performances such as cycle performance and electric capacity.",
        "The present invention has an object to provide a non-aqueous electrolytic solution which solves the above-mentioned problems concerning lithium secondary batteries and which is effective to impart an improved performance in the electric capacity, stability in the charged condition, and the cycle performance to a lithium secondary battery. The invention further has an object to provide a lithium secondary battery employing the non-aqueous electrolytic solution.",
        "The present invention resides in a non-aqueous electrolytic solution comprising an electrolytic salt in a non-aqueous solvent, which further contains a pentafluorophenoxy compound having the formula (I):",
        "in which R represents a substituting group selected from the group consisting of an alkylcarbonyl group having 2-12 carbon atoms, an alkoxycarbonyl group having 2-12 carbon atoms, an aryloxycarbonyl group having 7-18 carbon atoms, and an alkanesulfonyl group having 1-12 carbon atoms, provided that at least one hydrogen atom contained in the substituting group can be replaced with a halogen atom or an aryl group having 6-18 carbon atoms.",
        "The invention further resides in a lithium secondary battery which comprises a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and a non-aqueous electrolytic solution comprising an electrolytic salt in a non-aqueous solvent, in which the non-aqueous electrolytic solution further contains a pentafluorophenoxy compound of the above-mentioned formula (I).",

Further, an alkylcarbonyl group in which an alkyl substituent having an unsaturated bonding such as methylene (CH2\u2550) or allyl (CH2\u2550CH\u2014CH2\u2014) can be mentioned. Examples are vinylcarbonyl and 1-methylvinyl-carbonyl.",

        "An example of the aryloxycarbonyl group having 7-18 carbon atoms is o-, m-, or p-tolyloxycarbonyl group.",
        "Examples of the pentafluorophenoxy compounds having an arylokycarbonyl group include phenyl pentafluorophenylcarbonate and dipentafluorophenyl carbonate.",
        "Examples of the alkanesulfonyl group having 1-12 carbon atoms include methanesulfonyl, ethanesulfonyl, propanesulfonyl, butanesulfonyl, pentanesulfonyl, hexanesulfonyl, heptanesulfonyl, octanesulfonyl, nonanesulfonyl, decanesulfonyl, and dodecanesulfonyl. Further, branched alkanesulfonyl groups such as 2-propanesufonyl can be mentioned.",
        "Furthermore, substituting groups in which at least one hydrogen atom contained in the substituting group is replaced with a halogen atom. Examples of the last substituting groups are trifluoromethanesulfonyl and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanesulfonyl.",
        "Examples of the pentafluorophenoxy compounds having an alkanesulfonyl group include pentafluorophenyl methanesulfonate, pentafluorophenyl ethanesulfonate, pentafluorophenyl propanesulfonate, pentafluorophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, and pentafluorophenyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethanesulfonate.",
        "In the invention, one or more pentafluorphenoxy compounds are contained in the non-aqueous electrolytic solution. If the pentafluorophenoxy compound of the formula (I) is contained in the non-electrolytic solution in an excessive amount, the battery performances may lower. If the amount is too small, the expected improvement in the battery performance may not appear. Accordingly, the amount in the non-aqueous electrolytic solution generally is 0.01 to 20 wt. %, preferably 0.05 to 10 wt. %, more preferably 0.1 to 5 wt. %, from the viewpoint of increase of the cycle performance.",

It is preferred to employ carbonaceous materials having a graphite crystal structure in which the lattice distance of lattice surface (002), namely, d002, is in the range of 0.335 to 0.340 nm (nanometer). The active materials of negative electrode can be employed singly or in combination.

There are no limitations with respect to the preparing method of the negative electrode. The negative electrode can be prepared by a method similar to that for the preparation of the positive electrode.",

        "The coin-type battery was charged at room temperature (20\u00b0 C.) with a constant electric current (1.1 mA) to reach 4.2 V for 5 hours. Subsequently, the battery was discharged to give a constant electric current (1.1 mA) to give a terminal voltage of 2.7 V. The charging-discharging cycle test was repeated.",
