Pieces of 1.5-2.0 cm length were cut and placed in the organ bath of 20 ml capacity, attaching one end to the tissue holder and other to the transducer by a fine cotton thread. The system was previously calibrated before start of each experiment. Tissue was kept under a resting tension of 0.5-0.75 g. The bath solution was continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and maintained at 35\u00b0 C. temperature. After an initial 30 min of equilibration time the baseline was recorded and non-cumulative responses with sub maximal dose of histamine (7.2\u00d710\u22127M) were initially recorded until the responses were reproducible. The contractions to this typical dose of histamine in absence (only vehicle) and presence of at least 3 different concentrations of the test compounds were recorded after 15 min constant incubation time. The percentage inhibitions caused by different concentrations of test compounds were plotted against the log of molar concentrations of the test compounds for the determination of IC50.",
