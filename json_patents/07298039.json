        "Modules using semiconductor integrated circuits have been used not only for small electronic devices such as video cameras and cellular phones but also to control car engines and revolutions of train wheels. Each of such modules builds electronic parts having semiconductor functions and electronic parts having resistance functions on a circuit board to control signals. To increase the reliability, an example of such modules is manufactured by bonding a circuit board in a casing, mounting electronic parts in place on the circuit board and packing thereof with silicone gel which is flexible in a wide temperature range. This example has been well known as a module that can improve the withstand voltage characteristic. However, this kind of module uses a casing. This results in making its size greater. Further, silicone gel takes a lot of time in injection and hardening and is low in heat radiation characteristic. Japanese Application Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 10-79453 discloses a method of packing a module with a thermosetting resin component. This method packs one side of a circuit board with a thermosetting resin. As the coefficient of thermal expansion of the thermosetting resin component is different from that of the circuit board, the module is apt to warp. Japanese Application Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 10-135377 discloses a method to make the coefficient of thermal expansion of the thermosetting resin closer to that of the circuit board. However, as this method also packs only one side of the circuit board, the interface between the circuit board and the thermosetting resin component is mostly exposed to the atmosphere and apt to be separated.",

        "Recently, control devices of vehicles have been demanded to have high control functions to assure comfortable ride and good mileage of vehicles. Further, they have been demanded to reduce production costs and the number of parts. To meet such demands, control devices have been modularized to combine semiconductor elements, resistors, and capacitors. Recently, however, a machine has been required to house its control device in it to further reduce the number of parts. For example, some approaches have been made to build a control device in a transmission to unify a control device and a machine part. Such a control device is required to overcome the problems below. The first problem is downsizing. The control device must be made smaller to be housed in a limited space in a machine part. The second problem is a warpage. The control device should have a little warpage to be housed in a limited space. The third problem is a resistance to thermal changes. The control device should not cause any separation and cracks and should assure its reliability after a long-period exposure to violent thermal changes near a machine part. The fourth problem is an oil resistance. The control device should be so reliable not to cause any malfunction and part separation even in oily hot environments. The fifth problem is a heat radiation. The control device should have a good heat-radiation ability to keep its temperature below the high temperature limit of a semiconductor element that works in a hot operating environment.",
        "After carefully examining the above problems, we inventors have found that a compound metallic material made from copper oxide and at least one metal selected from a set of gold, silver, and copper is low in modulus of elasticity but high in thermal conductivity and high in adhesiveness to a packing material. We made a module structure by bonding a multi-layer circuit board which connects a semiconductor operating element, semiconductor memory elements, and passive elements thereon and a supporting material with this compound metallic material and packing these into a single package by transfer-molding. We have also found that this resulting downsized electronic circuit device having little warpage excels in resistance to thermal changes, resistance to oil, and heat radiation. From the above facts, we have completed this invention. In other words, this invention is characterized in the electronic circuit devices below.",

Further as the multi-layer circuit board and the supporting material are bonded to each other with a compound metallic material made from copper oxide and at least one metal selected from a set of gold, silver, and copper, the circuit device excels in heat radiation. The low modulus of elasticity of this compound metallic material relaxes stresses due to a difference of thermal expansions of the supporting material and the multi-layer circuit board, prevents separation thereof, relaxes stresses of the packing material and the compound metallic material, and consequently prevents cracks in the packing material. Further, as this compound metallic material is strongly bonded to the packing material, no separation will occur between the compound metallic material and the packing material.",

We prepared the compound metallic material 2 by mixing copper powder and Cu2O powder, cold-pressing the mixture, and sintering it at 950\u00b0 C. for three hours. The resulting compound metallic material is 55 mm long\u00d745 mm wide\u00d70.7 mm thick containing 50% by volume of copper and 50% by volume of Cu2O. The surface roughness (Ra) is 0.2 in 40% or more of the surface area of the compound metallic material and the void content is 6.5%. We prepared an electronic circuit device by bonding the compound metallic material 2 to a copper supporting material 3 with thermosetting resin XNR1244 (fabricated by Nagase ChemTeck), hardening thereof at 150\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes (junction 6), printing thermosetting resin XNR1244 (fabricated by Nagase ChemTeck) on the compound metallic material 2, dispensing silver paste in place on the multi-layer circuit board 1 to mark locations of a bare-chip microcomputer 7 containing memory, a transistor 8, and a diode 13, placing the microcomputer 7, a transistor 8, and a diode 13 on the locations, hardening the silver paste at 150\u00b0 C. for one hour for adhesion, heating the microcomputer 7 containing memory up to 200\u00b0 C. from the circuit side of the multi-layer circuit board on the heating stage, electrically connecting pats of the microcomputer 7 and the lands on the multi-layer circuit board 1 with gold wires 9 by the ultrasonic wire-bonding, dispensing the solder paste of 3.5 parts of Ag, 0.3 part of Cu, and 96.2 parts of Sn by weight as a conductive material 10 to the lands on the multi-layer circuit board 1, placing parts such as resistors 11 and capacitors 12 on the multi-layer circuit board 1, melting solder (junction 5) and the conductive material 10 at 270\u00b0 C. by the infrared reflow equipment, solidifying thereof to make electric connections between the electronic parts (resistors 11 and capacitors 12) and the multi-layer circuit board 1, placing the multi-layer circuit board 1 on the thermosetting adhesive of the assembly of the prepared supporting material 3 and the compound metallic material 2, connecting terminals 15, the transistor 8, and the diode 13 to the multi-layer circuit board 1 with Al wires (as wire 14) at a room temperature by ultrasonic wire bonding, applying the packaging resin component 4 which contains 80% by volume of silica filler as an inorganic filling material and gels in 30 seconds at 180\u00b0 C., and molding the resin component 4 at a mold temperature of 180\u00b0 C. and a transfer pressure of 7 MPa for three minutes by a low-pressure transfer-molding. The characteristics of the packaging resin component after hardening are 3 GPa (as the modulus of elasticity at a room temperature), 8 ppm/\u00b0 C. (as the coefficient of line expansion), and 120\u00b0 C. (as the glass transition temperature).",
        "We tested this prepared electronic circuit device for warpage, air tightness, moldability, mass productivity, malfunction, separation, and cracks after a thermal shock of 2000 cycles, separation, malfunction, and heat radiation after dipping in oil at 140\u00b0 C. for 2000 hours. Table 1 lists the result of this test.",
        "As described above, the electronic circuit device is a single package which packs the whole multi-layer circuit board. This can reduce the size and warpage of the device and makes the device highly resistant to oil. Further as the multi-layer circuit board and the supporting material are bonded to each other with a compound metallic material made from copper and copper oxide, the circuit device excels in heat radiation. The low modulus of elasticity of this compound metallic material relaxes stresses due to a difference of thermal expansions of the supporting material and the multi-layer circuit board, prevents separation thereof, relaxes stresses of the packing material and the compound metallic material, and consequently prevents cracks in the packing material. Further, the use of the ceramic multi-layer circuit board has an effect to increase the thermal conductivity and improve the heat radiation property. Further, the use of a metallic material containing copper in major proportions has an effect to improve the heat radiation property. The packing resin component containing 75% or more by volume of inorganic filling material can improve its oil resistance. As the compound metallic material made from copper and copper oxide is greater than the multi-layer circuit board, stresses will converge on the compound metallic material rather than the multi-layer circuit board. This can prolong the lives of elements connected to the multi-layer circuit board. The organic adhesive used to bond the compound metallic material to the multi-layer circuit board has an effect to release the stresses and prevent parts separation. The organic adhesive used to bond the compound metallic material to the supporting material has an effect to release the stresses and prevent parts separation. Furthermore, as the surface roughness (Ra) is between 0.01 and 500 \u03bcm (including both) in 40% or more of the surface area of said compound metallic material (where Ra is an arithmetic average of roughness defined by JIS B 0660, 1998), the adhesiveness to the packaging resin component is superior and very reliable.",
        "A resin-packaged semiconductor device of Comparative Example 1 has a structure shown in FIG. 3. This example uses a plastic casing 16 incorporating ceramic multi-layer circuit board 1. We prepared this semiconductor device by dispensing solder paste (which starts to melt at 232\u00b0 C.) which is an alloy of 5.0% of Pb and 95.0% of Sn (by weight) to mark locations of a microcomputer 7 containing memory, a transistor 8, and a diode 13 on the multilayer circuit board 1, melting the solder paste in the infrared reflow equipment, solidifying thereof to bond the microcomputer 7 containing memory, the transistor 8, and the diode 13 to the multi-layer circuit board 1, heating the microcomputer 7 containing memory up to 200\u00b0 C. from the circuit side of the multi-layer circuit board on the heating stage, electrically connecting pats of the microcomputer 7 and the lands on the multi-layer circuit board 1 with gold wires 9 by the ultrasonic wire-bonding, and electrically connecting the transistor 8 and the diode 13 to the multi-layer circuit board with Al wires (as wire 14) at a room temperature by ultrasonic wire bonding.",
