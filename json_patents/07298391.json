        "Braille is a writing system for visually impaired or sightless people, consisting of raised elements, e.g. bumps, that are read by touch. A Braille document may include a pattern of Braille elements that are embossed in a relatively thick paper.",
        "A Braille printer may be used to generate Braille documents using a computer system. A Braille printer may include a mechanism for embossing Braille elements into a relatively thick paper. For example, a Braille printer may include a mechanism for punching a pattern of bumps into a thick paper. The relative thickness of the paper is intended to hold the shape of the bumps in the paper.",
        "Unfortunately, prior Braille printers may be relatively expensive and cumbersome to use. For example, an embossing mechanism for punching Braille elements into paper may be relatively expensive to manufacture particularly in light of the relatively low volume of Braille printers that may be produced. In addition, the relatively thick paper used in prior Braille printers may be expensive and difficult to obtain in comparison to paper that is used in sight read text/graphics printers.",
        "A laser printer for Braille is disclosed that obviates the need for embossing mechanisms and specialized paper. A laser printer that prints a Braille element according to the present teachings increases an amount of a toner that adheres to an area of the paper that corresponds to the Braille element. The increased amount of toner yields a printed Braille element that may be read by touch.",
        "Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the detailed description that follows.",
        "The present invention is described with respect to particular exemplary embodiments thereof and reference is accordingly made to the drawings in which:",
        "FIG. 1 shows a laser printer for printing Braille onto a paper according to the present techniques;",
        "FIG. 2 shows progressive close-up views of an example set of Braille characters written onto a drum of a laser printer according to the present techniques;",
        "FIG. 3 shows a set of control circuits in a laser printer that are employed in printing Braille.",
        "FIG. 1 shows a laser printer 10 for printing Braille onto a paper 12 according to the present techniques. The paper 12 may be the same type of paper that may be used for printing text or graphics suitable for sight reading.",
        "The laser printer 10 includes a drum 26 that rotates, e.g. in a counter-clockwise direction as shown. The drum 26 includes a photoconductive material that may be discharged by light. As the drum 26 rotates, a drum charger 30 imparts a positive electrical charge onto the drum 26. The drum charger 30 may be an electrical wire with electrical current passing through or may be a charged roller.",
        "The laser printer 10 writes a Braille element onto the drum 26 by performing an enhanced discharge of an area of the drum 26 that corresponds to the Braille element. The amount of the enhanced discharge may be selected to increase an amount of a toner 34 from a toner holder 35 that adheres to the area of the drum 26 that corresponds to the Braille element. For example, the enhanced discharge may be selected to yield a tactile feel, e.g. a bump feel, to the Braille element after the toner that adheres to the Braille element is transferred to and fused onto the paper 12.",
        "In one embodiment, the enhanced discharge of the area of the drum 26 corresponding to the Braille element is provided by applying an enhanced amount of light from a laser 22 onto the area of the drum 26. For example, a set of additional pulses of light may be applied from the laser 22 to the area of the drum 26 corresponding to the Braille element.",
        "The laser printer 10 includes a scanning mirror 24 that applies light pulses from the laser 22 onto the drum 26. The combination of motions of the scanning mirror 24, the rotation of the drum 26, and the light pulses from the laser 22 are used to draw Braille elements onto the drum 26.",
        "The laser printer 10 includes a roller 32 that rolls the toner 34 onto the surface of the drum 26 as it rotates. The toner 34 is positively charged and adheres to the negatively charged areas of the drum 26. The enhanced discharge of the area of the drum 26 corresponding to the Braille element increases an amount of the toner 34 that adheres to the Braille element on the drum 26 in comparison to an amount of the toner 34 that adheres to areas not having an enhanced discharge, e.g. areas for printing text and graphics for sight reading.",
        "The laser printer 10 includes a paper charger 36 that applies a negative charge to the paper 12 as it approaches the drum 26. The paper charger 36 may be an electrical wire with electrical current passing through.",
        "The negative charge on the paper 12 attracts the toner that has adhered to the drum 26, thereby transferring the Braille element from the drum 26 onto the paper 12. The paper 12 then passes through a fuser 28 that melts the deposited toner onto the paper 12. The enhanced amount of toner transferred from the Braille element on the drum 26 to the paper 12 yields a tactile feel on the paper 12 after fusing.",
        "The laser printer 10 includes a drum discharger 29, e.g. a bright lamp, that discharges the drum 26 to erase the Braille element from the drum 26.",
        "In other embodiments, the above-described charge polarities may be reversed. For example, the drum 26 may initially be charged to a negative charge and then written by positively charging the Braille element areas of the drum 26.",
        "FIG. 2 shows progressive close-up views of an example set of Braille characters 40-46 written onto the drum 26. The Braille characters 40-46 are written using combination of motions of the scanning mirror 24, the rotation of the drum 26, and a series light pulses from the laser 22.",
        "A close-up view of the Braille character 40 shows that it includes an arrangement of Braille elements 60-64. The Braille elements 60-64 each define an area that will be perceivable to touch, i.e. a bump, when printed on the paper 12. The laser 22 writes the Braille elements 60-64 by applying a series of light pulses 50 that discharge the areas of the drum 26 that correspond to the Braille elements 60-64 on the drum 26.",
        "A close-up view of the Braille element 60 shows that the series of light pulses 50 discharge an arrangement of dots 70. Each dot 70 corresponds to the resolution of the laser 22 and the scanning mirror 24, i.e. the maximum resolution of the laser printer 10.",
        "The pattern used to make up the Braille element 60 may have a significant impact on the amount of toner transferred. Depending on the embodiment, the pattern may be a solid fill of toner, or a specific pattern of dots designed to maximize the toner pile height. For example, on jump gap systems in which the roller 32 is not in contact with the drum 26, a solid filled area has higher amounts of toner at the edges than in the center. A series of rings or separate larger dots that are larger than the native resolution of the laser printer 10 may yield a significant increases in toner over a solid filled area.",
        "The laser printer 10 when printing a Braille element uses the laser 22 to provide a greater discharge of the drum 26 so that the discharge pattern on the drum 26 attracts more of the toner 34 from the roller 32. In one embodiment, the laser printer 10 when printing a text or graphics image for sight reading applies one pulse of the laser 22 per dot of resolution. For a Braille element, the laser printer 10 applies two or more pulses of the laser 22 to each of the dots 70. Each pulse of the laser 22 on each dot 70 produces a greater negative charge on the drum 26.",
        "FIG. 3 shows a set of control circuits in the laser printer 10 that are employed in printing Braille. The laser printer 10 includes a printer controller 80 that receives print files from a computer system via a communication path 86. Examples of the communication path 86 includes a USB port, parallel port, serial port, Ethernet, etc.",
        "The laser printer 10 includes a printer memory 82 that holds a bit map of the dots to be printed onto the paper 12 when printing Braille. In some embodiments, the bit map is generated on a computer system and transferred to the laser printer 10 via the communication path 86. In other embodiments, the printer controller 80 generates the bit map in response to information contained in a print file obtained via the communication path 86.",
        "The laser printer 10 includes a laser controller 84. The printer controller 80 issues commands to the laser controller 84. The commands cause the laser controller 84 to issue control signals 88 to the laser 22 and the scanning mirror 24 to hit the drum 26 with pulses of light. When printing Braille, the printer controller 80 causes the laser controller 84 to generate additional pulses of light for each dot of a Braille element.",
        "The laser printer 10 includes a bias control circuit 94 that generates a set of control signals 90 for controlling biases applied to the toner holder 35 that contains the toner 34 and for controlling an amount of charge applied to the drum 26 by the drum charger 30. The bias control circuit 94 enables the printer controller 80 to print Braille elements by controlling the charge on the drum 26 together with a bias applied to the toner holder 35 so that more of the toner 34 is attracted to the drum 26 when printing Braille elements. In one embodiment of the laser printer 10, the bias that is used to adjust the amount of the toner 34 placed on an area of the paper 12 is a DC bias for primary charging of the drum 26 and developing using the toner holder 35 of approximately 700VDC. For wider ranges of density, i.e. more toner deposition, both the DC and AC biases may be adjusted. The biases used on the toner 34 and the drum charger 30 may be independently controlled or may be controlled in concert. An interaction of the biases used on the toner 34 and the drum charger 30 may significantly influence how much toner is applied to the paper 12.",
        "The printer controller 80 uses the bias control circuit 94 to control the charge on the drum 26 together with a bias applied to the toner holder 35 on a page by page basis. The control of charge on the drum 26 with the bias to the toner holder 35 provides a density setting. The density is a measure of how much of the toner 34 is applied to the paper 12. The density may be used to provide a \u201cBraille page\u201d setting for the laser printer 10 such that the amount of the toner 34 applied to the drum 26 (and ultimately the paper 12) is maximized. The Braille page setting may be used in combination with extra light pulses from the laser 22 when printing Braille elements.",
        "The particles of the toner 34 may be enlarged to facilitate the formation of tactile bumps for Braille elements. If toner particle size is changed, the DC and AC biases may be adjusted to compensate for the changed particle size.",
        "The laser printer 10 includes a fuser control circuit 96 that generates a set of control signals 92 to the fuser 28. The fuser control circuit 96 enables the printer controller 80 to control an amount of pressure applied by a set of rollers in the fuser 28 to the paper 12. For example, the printer controller 80 may reduce the amount of pressure applied by the rollers when printing a Braille page. The reduced pressure increases the height of Braille bumps. In addition, the fuser control circuit 96 enables the printer controller 80 to control the temperature applied by the fuser 28. For example, the temperature of the fuser 28 may be reduced when printing a Braille page so that the height of Braille bumps is increased.",
        "The printer controller 80 may reduce the speed of movement of the paper 12 when printing a Braille page. For example, the laser printer 10 in one embodiment includes a motor control circuit 110 that generates a set of control signal 112 that provide paper speeds of one-half, one-third, and one quarter normal speed. The different speeds may be employed for different types of media that require significantly more heating. A slower print speed enables the paper 12 to spend more time in the fuser 28 to increase heat to the toner without generating more heat in the fuser 28. The increased time in the fuser 28 increases the heat applied to the paper 12 and facilitates the heating of larger amounts of toner on Braille elements.",
        "The foregoing detailed description of the present invention is provided for the purposes of illustration and is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise embodiment disclosed. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims."
