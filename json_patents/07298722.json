    "description": [
        "The present invention relates to a radio transmitting apparatus and radio transmission method for use in a radio communication system that employs CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) technologies.",
        "Conventionally, in a radio communication system combining OFDM and CDMA (hereinafter referred to as \u201cOFDM-CDMA\u201d), the combination of the characteristic of resistance to frequency selective fading that is an advantage of OFDM modulation, and the characteristic of excellent interference resistance through spreading gain that is an advantage of CDMA, results in an ability to implement high-speed, high-quality communications.",
        "OFDM-CDMA methods broadly comprise a time domain spreading method and a frequency domain spreading method. With the time domain spreading method, spread data that have been spread on a chip-by-chip basis by means of a spreading code are arranged in the time direction within the same subcarrier. With the frequency domain spreading method, on the other hand, spread data that have been spread on a chip-by-chip basis are assigned to different subcarriers.",
        "The frequency domain spreading method will now be described. FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram showing the state of digital symbols before OFDM-CDMA processing, and FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram showing the arrangement of chips after OFDM-CDMA processing using frequency domain spreading. With frequency domain spreading, each of N digital symbols constituting a serial data sequence (FIG. 1) is multiplied by, for example, a spreading code with a spreading factor of M, the same value as the number of subcarriers M.",
        "After spreading, the chips, arranged with M chips in parallel, undergo IFFT (inverse fast Fourier transform) processing sequentially, one symbol at a time. As a result, N OFDM symbols for M subcarriers are created. That is to say, with frequency domain spreading, spread chips are arranged on the frequency axis at their respective times (FIG. 2). In other words, spread chips are allocated to different subcarriers.",
        "A sample configuration of a conventional OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus that implements this frequency spreading method is shown in FIG. 3. First, transmitting system 2 of OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus 1 will be described. In the OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus 1, a plurality of transmit signals 1 through k, . . . , (4k+1) through 5k are input to spreaders A1 through A(5k) that perform spreading processing using different spreading codes. The spread signals are added by adders C1 through C5, as a result of which code division multiplexed signals are obtained. In the case shown in FIG. 3, k transmit signals are multicode-multiplexed by each of adders C1 through C5.",
        "The code division multiplexed signals output from adders C1 through C5 undergo parallel/serial conversion by a parallel/serial converter (P/S) 4, and then undergo orthogonal frequency division multiplexing by means of inverse fast Fourier transform processing by an inverse fast Fourier transform circuit (IFFT) 5. By this means, an OFDM-CDMA signal is formed in which spread chips are distributed among a plurality of subcarriers that have a mutually orthogonal relationship, and this OFDM-CDMA signal is transmitted via a radio transmitting section (RF) 10 that performs radio transmission processing such as digital/analog conversion and signal amplification, and an antenna AN.",
        "Next, receiving system 3 of OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus 1 will be described. In OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus 1, an OFDM-CDMA signal transmitted from an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus with a similar configuration is input to a fast Fourier transform circuit (FFT) 6 via an antenna AN and a radio receiving section (RF) 11 that performs radio reception processing such as analog/digital conversion. FFT 6 executes fast Fourier transform processing on the input signal, and thereby extracts a code division multiplexed signal distributed among a plurality of subcarriers.",
        "A propagation path compensation circuit 7 compensates for phase fluctuations, etc., occurring in the propagation path, based on a known signal such as a propagation path estimation preamble included in the signal. After propagation path compensation, the signal is despread by a despreader 8, and the received signal for that station is extracted from the spread plurality of transmit signals.",
        "FIG. 4 shows the arrangement of OFDM-CDMA signals formed by OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus 1. As can be seen from FIG. 4, radio transmitting apparatus divides 5k transmit signals 1 through 5k into 5 groups, forms code division multiplexed signals on a group-by-group basis, and performs frequency domain spreading of the code division multiplexed signals in subcarriers of different groups.",
        "Specifically, code division multiplexed transmit signals 1 through k are allocated by frequency domain spreading to subcarriers #1 through #m, the same number as the spreading ratio m, code division multiplexed transmit signals k+1 through 2k are allocated by frequency domain spreading to subcarriers #4m+1 through #5m, and so on through to code division multiplexed transmit signals 4k+1 through 5k, which are allocated by frequency domain spreading to subcarriers #m+1 through #2m.",
        "The number of subcarriers need not coincide with the spreading ratio. Here, a case has been shown in which subcarriers are divided into 5 subcarrier groups, and the spreading ratio is made 1/5 the number of subcarriers in order for code division multiplexed signals to be allocated within each subcarrier group. However, the spreading ratio is not limited to this case, and may be set arbitrarily.",
        "In an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus, it is necessary to increase the degree of signal multiplexing in order to improve spectral efficiency. However, in a multipath environment, for instance, orthogonality between spreading codes is lost and error rate characteristics degrade. This is because multipathing occurs independently in each subcarrier, and therefore inter-chip orthogonality is lost when each spread chip is spread along the frequency axis.",
        "As the degree of signal multiplexing is increased, in particular, interference between spreading codes also increases, resulting in greater degradation of error rate characteristics. Thus, a problem with conventional OFDM-CDMA communication apparatuses is the difficulty of making spectral efficiency compatible with error rate characteristics.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide an OFDM-CDMA radio transmitting apparatus and radio transmission method that make it possible to make spectral efficiency compatible with error rate characteristics.",
        "This object is achieved by forming subcarriers to which spread signals are allocated only in the frequency axis direction, and subcarriers to which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, when performing radio transmission using the OFDM-CDMA method.",

        "With reference now to the accompanying drawings, embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail below.",
        "In an OFDM-CDMA radio transmitting apparatus according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention, the degree of signal multiplexing is set individually for each subcarrier. For example, the spreading ratio may be set as 1/5 the number of subcarriers, with all subcarriers being divided into 5 subcarrier groups. Here, as shown in FIG. 5, the degree of signal multiplexing is set low for one subcarrier group G1 (indicated by shading in FIG. 5) of the 5 subgroups.",
        "As a result, within the 5 subcarrier groups, error rate characteristics can be improved for subcarrier group G1 without lowering spectral efficiency at all for the subcarrier groups other than subcarrier group G1. By this means, it is possible to make spectral efficiency compatible with error rate characteristics.",
        "In this embodiment, a signal for a communicating party whose channel quality is poor, such as a distant radio station or a radio station with a poor SIR (Signal to Interference Ratio), for example, is allocated to subcarrier group G1 for which the degree of signal multiplexing is set low. By this means, it is possible to improve the error rate characteristics of a communicating party with poor channel quality, with almost no lowering of spectral efficiency.",
        "Here, a case has been described in which the spreading ratio is made 1/5 the number of subcarriers, but the spreading ratio is not restricted to this case, and can be set arbitrarily. For example, it is possible to divide all the subcarriers into 4 subcarrier groups, and to set the spreading ratio of one of those subcarrier groups at twice that of the other groups.",
        "Thus, according to this embodiment, by setting the degree of signal multiplexing individually for each subcarrier and reducing the degree of signal multiplexing for a user with poor channel quality, it is possible to improve error rate characteristics with almost no lowering of spectral efficiency.",
        "The actual configuration of an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus according to this embodiment will now be described, using FIG. 6. Transmitting system 101 of OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus 100 divides n transmit signals 1 through n into 5 groups, and performs frequency domain spreading of transmit signals within each group onto the same plurality of subcarriers.",
        "In actuality, in transmitting system 101, transmit signals 1 through n are input to spreaders A1 through An, which perform spreading processing using different spreading codes. The spread signals are added by adders B1 through B5 as signal multiplexing degree selecting sections, one of which is provided for each group (in this embodiment, each of 5 groups), and by this means, code division multiplexed signals S1 through S5 corresponding to the predetermined number of groups are obtained.",
        "Here, in transmitting system 101, adders B1 through B4 form code division multiplexed signals S1 through S4 in each of which k transmit signals are multiplexed, whereas adder B5 forms code division multiplexed signal S5 in which fewer than k transmit signals are multiplexed. That is to say, the number of signals (n\u22124k) of transmit signals (4k+1) through n that are code division multiplexed by adder B5 is selected so that 1<(n\u22124k)<k. By this means, code division multiplexed signals S1 through S4, and S5, with different chip rates, are output by adders B1 through B4 and adder B5.",
        "Code division multiplexed signals S1 through S5 obtained by adders B1 through B5, respectively, are input to a parallel/serial converter (P/S) 102 as a multiplex signal allocation selecting section. Parallel/serial converter 102 rearranges code division multiplexed signals S1 through S5 in a predetermined order, and outputs them as a serial signal S6. In this embodiment, this arrangement order determines which subcarrier groups in FIG. 5 code division multiplexed signals S1 through S5 are allocated to by frequency domain spreading.",
        "Serial signal S6 output from parallel/serial converter 102 is input to an inverse fast Fourier transform circuit (IFFT) 103 as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing section. Inverse fast Fourier transform circuit 103 executes inverse fast Fourier transform processing on serial signal S6 for each of code division multiplexed signals S1 through S5, and thereby allocates spread chips by distributing them among a plurality of subcarriers that are in a mutually orthogonal relationship.",
        "At this time, code division multiplexed signal S1 that was code division multiplexed by adder B1, for example, is allocated by frequency domain spreading to a certain subcarrier group, and code division multiplexed signal S5 that was code division multiplexed by adder B5 is allocated by frequency domain spreading to subcarrier group G1 in FIG. 5.",
        "In this way, it is possible to form an OFDM-CDMA signal S7 in which a transmit signal with a smaller degree of multiplexing than other subcarrier groups is allocated to subcarrier group G1. Obtained OFDM-CDMA signal S7 is then transmitted via a radio transmitting section (RF) 104 that performs radio transmission processing such as digital/analog conversion and signal amplification, and an antenna AN.",
        "Next, receiving system 110 of OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus 100 will be described. In OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus 100, an OFDM-CDMA signal transmitted from an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus with a similar configuration is input to a fast Fourier transform circuit (FFT) 111 via antenna AN and a radio receiving section (RF) 114 that performs radio reception processing such as analog/digital conversion. FFT 111 executes fast Fourier transform processing on the input signal, and thereby extracts a code division multiplexed signal distributed among a plurality of subcarriers.",
        "A propagation path compensation circuit 112 compensates for phase fluctuations, etc., occurring in the propagation path, based on a known signal such as a propagation path estimation preamble included in the signal. After propagation path compensation, the signal is despread by a despreader 113, and the received signal for that station is extracted from the spread plurality of transmit signals.",
        "With the above configuration, transmit signals (4k+1) through n allocated to subcarriers with a low degree of signal multiplexing are subject to less inter-code interference on the propagation path than transmit signals 1 through k, . . . , (3k+1) through 4k allocated to subcarriers with a high degree of multiplexing.",
        "As a result, compared with the case in which the degree of signal multiplexing is decided uniformly for all subcarriers, if transmit signals (4k+1) through n carrying important information or for which it is desired to improve the error rate are allocated to subcarriers with a low degree of signal multiplexing, and transmit signals 1 through k, . . . , (3k+1) through 4k for which the error rate need not be improved so much are allocated to subcarriers with a high degree of signal multiplexing, degradation of error rate characteristics can be prevented without lowering spectral efficiency significantly.",
        "Thus, an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus 100 can be implemented that enables spectral efficiency and error rate characteristics to be made compatible.",
        "A special feature of an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention is that, by selecting as a transmit signal for which the degree of signal multiplexing is set low, described in Embodiment 1, a transmit signal such as retransmission information or control information for which better channel quality is required than for other data, the quality of data for which better channel quality is required than for other data is improved.",
        "FIG. 7 shows the configuration of an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus according to this embodiment. In OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus 200 according to this embodiment, the special feature lies particularly in the transmitting system 201, and therefore a description of the receiving system will be omitted. In FIG. 7, in which parts corresponding to those in FIG. 6 are assigned the same codes as in FIG. 6, OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus 200 transmits retransmission signals 1 through m as transmit signals for which the degree of signal multiplexing is set low.",
        "That is to say, number of signals m of retransmission signals 1 through m is selected so that 1<m<k. As a result, code division multiplexed retransmission signals 1 through m are allocated by frequency domain spreading to subcarrier group G1 with a low degree of signal multiplexing shown in FIG. 5, thereby enabling the error rate characteristics of those retransmission signals 1 through m to be improved.",
        "In performing retransmission as referred to here, the propagation path environment between the local station and the far-end station are often poor, and as the number of retransmissions increases the same signal must be transmitted numerous times, resulting in lower transmission efficiency. In this embodiment, the error rate characteristics of retransmission signals 1 through m can be improved, making it possible to reduce the number of retransmissions.",
        "Signals allocated to subcarriers for which the degree of signal multiplexing is set low are not limited to retransmission signals, and control signals may also be effectively allocated to such subcarriers. For example, if the quality of a control signal degrades, it may no longer be possible to establish communication. According to this embodiment, this can be prevented effectively.",
        "According to the above configuration, by allocating data such as retransmission information or control information, for which better channel quality is required than for other data, to subcarriers for which the degree of signal multiplexing is set low, the quality of data for which better channel quality is required than for other data can be improved with almost no lowering of spectral efficiency.",
        "A special feature of an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus according to Embodiment 3 of the present invention is that, in addition to providing the configuration of Embodiment 1, by reducing the degree of signal multiplexing of subcarriers that include the DC (Direct Current) point, as shown in FIG. 8, the error rate characteristics of the subcarrier located at the DC point are improved.",
        "Generally, in an OFDM-CDMA radio transmitting apparatus, DC offset is generated by analog circuitry provided in the amplifier of the radio transmitting section (RF) 104, and therefore the error rate characteristics of a signal transmitted by subcarriers near the DC point are poorer than those of signals transmitted by other subcarriers.",
        "Focusing on this point, this embodiment improves the error rate characteristics of a subcarrier located at the DC point by reducing the degree of signal multiplexing of subcarriers that include the DC point.",
        "In FIG. 9, in which parts corresponding to those in FIG. 6 are assigned the same codes as in FIG. 6, transmitting system 301 of OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus 300 according to this embodiment has a similar configuration to that of transmitting system 101 in FIG. 6 except for the configuration of parallel/serial converter (P/S) 302 as a multiplex signal allocation selecting section.",
        "That is to say, parallel/serial converter 302 forms a serial signal S10 in which code division multiplexed signals S1 through S5 are rearranged in an order whereby code division multiplexed signal S5 with a low degree of signal multiplexing, output from adder B5, is allocated to subcarrier group G2 that includes the DC point, as shown in FIG. 8, and sends this to next-stage inverse fast Fourier transform circuit 103. By this means, an OFDM-CDMA signal S11 is obtained from inverse fast Fourier transform circuit 103 such that code division multiplexed signal S5 with a low degree of signal multiplexing is allocated to subcarrier group G2 that includes the DC point, as shown in FIG. 8.",
        "According to the above configuration, the error rate characteristics of subcarriers including the DC point can be improved by reducing the degree of signal multiplexing of the subcarrier located at the DC point.",

        "When there are adjacent channel interference signals, the further a subcarrier is from the center frequency, the greater is the interference, and therefore the further a subcarrier is from the center frequency, the greater is the degradation of error rate characteristics. In addition, degradation (amplitude deviation or phase deviation) of an analog filter provided in the latter-stage radio transmitting section (RF) 104 is also greater the further a subcarrier is from the center frequency.",

By reducing the degree of signal multiplexing of subcarriers at a distance from the center frequency in this case, as in this embodiment, the transmission power of subcarriers at a distance from the center frequency can be decreased, and thus side lobes can also be decreased. As a result, according to the configuration of this embodiment, out-of-band leakage power can also be decreased.",
        "A special feature of an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus according to Embodiment 5 of the present invention is that error rate characteristics in the event of adjacent channel interference signals or analog filter degradation are further improved by raising the transmission power of subcarriers for which the degree of signal multiplexing is set low above that of other subcarriers, in addition to reducing the degree of signal multiplexing of subcarriers at a distance from the center frequency in the same way as in Embodiment 4.",
        "Subcarriers for which the degree of signal multiplexing is set low have lower transmission power than other subcarriers. Therefore, transmission power is further raised, enabling error rate characteristics in the event of adjacent channel interference signals or analog filter degradation to be further improved.",

This discrimination processing can be performed easily if, for example, the input signal is split in the same order as in the code division multiplexed signal rearrangement processing by parallel/serial converter 102 of transmitting system 601. This rearrangement order is assumed to have been determined beforehand between the respective radio stations. Discrimination can also be carried out based on the chip rate, etc., of the input code division multiplexed signal.",

        "This principle is not limited to OFDM-CDMA, but is also effective when applied to OFDM. That is to say, in OFDM, the modulation M-ary value of specific subcarriers is made smaller than the modulation M-ary value of the other subcarriers. For example, by making the modulation M-ary value of signals allocated to subcarriers for which degradation is greater than for other subcarriers, such as a subcarrier at the DC point and subcarriers on either side thereof, it is possible to improve error rate characteristics without greatly lowering transmission efficiency. Specifically, this can be implemented with a configuration virtually the same as the configuration of transmitting system 1001 in FIG. 20 with the exception of the spreaders and adders.

Therefore, the configuration can be simplified accordingly, and transmission efficiency can be improved in as much as a signal for frame synchronization such as a preamble need not be transmitted.",

        "In this embodiment, the degree of signal multiplexing is set individually for each subcarrier. Also, as shown in FIG. 5, the degree of signal multiplexing is set low for one subcarrier group G1 (indicated by shading in FIG. 5) of the five subcarrier groups.",
        "In addition, in this embodiment, chips that have undergone spreading processing are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction for subcarrier group G1. On the other hand, chips that have undergone spreading processing are allocated only in the frequency axis direction for other subcarrier groups.",
        "As a result, it is possible to significantly improve error rate characteristics for subcarrier group G1, with no decrease in spectral efficiency whatever for subcarrier groups other than subcarrier group G1 among the five subcarrier groups. By this means, it is possible to make spectral efficiency compatible with error rate characteristics.",
        "In this embodiment, a signal for a communicating party whose channel quality is poor, such as a distant radio station or a radio station with a poor SIR (Signal to Interference Ratio), for example, is allocated to subcarrier group G1. By this means, it is possible to improve the error rate characteristics of a communicating party with poor channel quality, with almost no lowering of spectral efficiency.",
        "As chips that have undergone spreading processing are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction for subcarrier group G1, even if the spreading ratio of a spread signal allocated to this subcarrier group G1 is made larger than the spreading ratio of spread signals allocated to other groups, it is possible to prevent the frequency band of other subcarrier groups from decreasing.",
        "In this embodiment, the spreading ratio of subcarrier groups other than subcarrier group G1 is made 1/5, and the spreading ratio of subcarrier group G1 is set to twice that of other subcarrier groups. However, spreading ratios are not limited to these, and a spreading ratio can be set individually for each subcarrier group.",
        "An actual sample configuration of an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus according to this embodiment will now be described, using FIG. 64. Transmitting system 4601 of OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus 4600 divides n transmit signals 1 through n into 5 groups, and forms an OFDM-CDMA signal by spreading transmit signals in each group in the frequency axis direction only of a plurality of subcarriers, or in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction (so-called \u201ctwo-dimensional spreading\u201d).",
        "In actuality, in transmitting system 4601, transmit signals 1 through n are input to spreaders A1 through An, which perform spreading processing using different spreading codes. The spreading ratio of spreaders A(4k+1) through An is set to a higher value than the spreading ratio of the other spreaders A1 through A(4k) For example, the spreading ratio of spreaders A(4k+1) through An may be set to 1/5 the number of subcarriers while the spreading ratio of spreaders A1 through A(4k) is set to twice that value.",
        "Spread signals are multiplexed by adders B1 through B5, one of which is provided for each group (in this embodiment, each of 5 groups), and by this means, code division multiplexed signals S1 through S5 corresponding to the predetermined number of groups are obtained.",
        "Here, in transmitting system 4601, adders B1 through B4 form code division multiplexed signals S1 through S4 in each of which k transmit signals are multiplexed, whereas adder B5 forms code division multiplexed signal S5 in which fewer than k transmit signals are multiplexed. That is to say, the number of signals (n\u22124k) of transmit signals (4k+1) through n that are code division multiplexed by adder B5 is selected so that 1<(n\u22124k)<k.",
        "Code division multiplexed signals S1 through S5 obtained by adders B1 through B5, respectively, are input to a parallel/serial converter (P/S) 4602 as a spread signal assigning section. Parallel/serial converter 4602, comprising memory and a flip-flop circuit, rearranges code division multiplexed signals S1 through S5 in a predetermined order, and outputs them as a serial signal S6. In this embodiment, this arrangement order determines which subcarrier groups in FIG. 5 code division multiplexed signals S1 through S5 are allocated to, and also determines whether allocation is performed only in the frequency axis direction or in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction.",
        "In this embodiment, code division multiplexed signal S5 for which the degree of signal multiplexing is set low and the spreading ratio is set high is allocated spread in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, and the other code division multiplexed signals S1 through S4 are allocated spread only in the frequency axis direction.",
        "Serial signal S6 output from parallel/serial converter 4602 is input to inverse fast Fourier transform circuit (IFFT) 103. Inverse fast Fourier transform circuit 103 executes inverse fast Fourier transform processing on serial signal S6 for each of code division multiplexed signals S1 through S5, and thereby allocates spread chips by distributing them among a plurality of subcarriers that are in a mutually orthogonal relationship.",
        "At this time, code division multiplexed signal S1 that was code division multiplexed by adder B1, for example, is allocated by frequency domain spreading to a certain subcarrier group, and code division multiplexed signal S5 that was code division multiplexed by adder B5 is allocated by spreading in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction to subcarrier group G1 in FIG. 5.",
        "In this way, it is possible to form an OFDM-CDMA signal S7 in which a spread signal spread in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction is allocated to subcarrier group G1, and spread signals spread only in the frequency axis direction are allocated to other subcarrier groups. Obtained OFDM-CDMA signal S7 is then transmitted via radio transmitting section (RF) 104 that performs radio transmission processing such as digital/analog conversion and signal amplification, and antenna AN.",
        "FIG. 65 shows an example of OFDM-CDMA signal S7 formed by OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus 4600. As can be seen from this drawing, code division multiplexed signal S5 obtained by spreading with a spreading ratio twice that of other code division multiplexed signals S1 through S4, is allocated by two-dimensional spreading to subcarriers in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction (that is, the spread signal is allocated over a plurality of symbols).",
        "In the above configuration, by providing a subcarrier group G1 in which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, it is possible to prevent the frequency band of other subcarrier groups from being decreased even if the spreading ratio of a spread signal allocated to this subcarrier group G1 is increased.",
        "Also, by providing subcarrier groups in which spread signals are allocated only in the frequency axis direction, wasteful band usage due to subcarriers that do not transmit any data can be prevented as compared with the case where spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction for all subcarriers.",
        "Moreover, by making the degree of multiplexing of transmit signals 4k+1 through n of subcarrier group G1, in which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, lower than the degree of signal multiplexing of other subcarrier groups, inter-code interference on the propagation path is reduced, and therefore the error rate characteristics of signals superimposed on subcarriers in which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction can be significantly improved.",
        "As a result, compared with a case in which the degree of multiplexing and spreading direction are decided uniformly for all subcarriers (for example, when it is decided that spread signals are to be allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction for all subcarriers) if transmit signals (4k+1) through n for which it is desired to improve error rate characteristics, such as important information, are spread in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction and also allocated to subcarriers with a low degree of signal multiplexing, and transmit signals 1 through k, . . . , (3k+1) through 4k for which the error rate need not be improved so much are spread only in the frequency axis direction and also allocated to subcarriers with a high degree of signal multiplexing, degradation of error rate characteristics can be prevented without lowering spectral efficiency significantly.",
        "Thus, by selecting independently for each subcarrier whether spread signals are to be allocated only in the frequency axis direction, or are to be allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus 4600 can be implemented that enables spectral efficiency and error rate characteristics to be made compatible.",
        "Furthermore, by making the degree of signal multiplexing of subcarriers for which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction higher than the degree of signal multiplexing of other subcarriers, it is possible to significantly improve the error rate characteristics of signals superimposed on these subcarriers.",
        "In this embodiment, a case has been described in which a code division multiplexed signal for which the degree of signal multiplexing is set lower than for others is spread in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, but the present invention is not limited to this, and it is possible to select independently for any subcarrier whether a signal spread only in the frequency axis direction is to be allocated, or a signal spread in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction is to be allocated.",
        "Also, in FIG. 65 of this embodiment a case has been illustrated in which a signal spread over two symbols is allocated as regards the time axis direction, but the present invention is not limited to this, and allocation is also possible over any number of symbols.",
        "A special feature of an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus according to Embodiment 47 of the present invention is that, as shown in FIG. 66, for subcarriers in which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, the degree of signal multiplexing is further decreased, and spread signals are allocated only in the frequency axis direction at intervals of a plurality of symbols.",
        "By this means, the receiving side need only perform processing from FFT (fast Fourier transform) onward for symbols to which a signal is allocated, enabling power consumption to be further reduced compared with Embodiment 1.",
        "FIG. 67 shows the configuration of the transmitting system of an OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus according to this embodiment. In FIG. 67, in which parts corresponding to those in FIG. 64 are assigned the same codes as in FIG. 64, in transmitting system 4701 of OFDM-CDMA communication apparatus 4700, users allocated to subcarriers for which spread signals are assigned in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction (transmit signals 4k+1 through n) are divided into two groups, for example.",
        "Specifically, a code division multiplexed signal S5-1 is obtained by multiplexing spread signals of half of the users by means of adder B5a, and a code division multiplexed signal S5-2 is obtained by multiplexing spread signals of the other half of the users by means of adder B5b. These code division multiplexed signals S5-1 and S5-2 are then sent to parallel/serial converter (P/S) 102 in a predetermined order via parallel/serial converter (P/S) 4702.",
        "By this means, in transmitting system 4701, as shown in FIG. 66, half of the users are allocated to the first symbol (transmit signals 4k+1 through n/2) and the other half of the users are allocated to the second symbol (transmit signals n/2+1 through n) (that is, they are allocated in the time axis direction). Looking at subcarriers of the same time, code division multiplexed signals of half of the users are allocated in the frequency axis direction. Thereafter, spread signals continue to be allocated to alternate symbols in the same way.",
        "According to the above configuration, when allocating spread signals in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, a plurality of transmit signals 1 through n are divided into at least two groups, a code division multiplexed signal of first group 4k+1 through n/2 and a code division multiplexed signal of second group n/2+1 through n are allocated alternately in the time axis direction, and a first or second group code division multiplexed signal is allocated in the frequency axis direction within the same time, so that on the receiving side, it is only necessary to process code division multiplexed signals (symbols) of the same group in the same time\u2014that is, to perform processing from FFT (fast Fourier transform) onward only for symbols allocated to subcarriers of the same time\u2014thereby enabling power consumption to be further reduced.",
        "In this embodiment, a case has been described in which spread signals are allocated every other symbol, but the present invention is not limited to this, and spread symbols can be allocated at intervals of any number of symbols.",
        "The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments, and various variations and modifications may be possible without departing from the scope of the present invention.",
        "A radio transmitting apparatus according to the present invention has a configuration comprising a plurality of spreading sections that spread a plurality of transmit signals using different spreading codes, and a spread signal assigning section that assigns a spread signal obtained by a spreading section to a plurality of subcarriers, wherein the spread signal assigning section assigns a spread signal only in the frequency axis direction, or in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, independently for each subcarrier.",
        "According to this configuration, by providing subcarriers to which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction., it is possible to prevent the frequency band of other subcarriers from decreasing even if the spreading ratio of spread signals allocated to those subcarriers is increased. Also, by providing subcarriers to which spread signals are allocated only in the frequency axis direction, wasteful band usage due to subcarriers that do not transmit any data can be prevented as compared with the case where spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction for all subcarriers. As a result, spectral efficiency and error rate characteristics can be made compatible.",
        "A radio transmitting apparatus according to the present invention has a configuration wherein the spreading ratios of the above-described plurality of spreading sections are set to different values.",
        "A radio transmitting apparatus according to the present invention has a configuration further comprising a first multiplexing section that multiplexes a first number of spread signals among the plurality of spread signals obtained by the above-described spreading sections, and a second multiplexing section that multiplexes a second number of spread signals smaller than the first number among the spread signals not multiplexed by that first multiplexing section, wherein the above-described spread signal assigning section assigns a code division multiplexed signal obtained by the first multiplexing section to frequency axis direction subcarriers, and assigns a code division multiplexed signal obtained by the second multiplexing section to both frequency axis direction and time axis direction subcarriers.",
        "According to this configuration, inter-code interference on the propagation path is lower for subcarriers for which the degree of transmit signal multiplexing is low than for subcarriers for which the degree of transmit signal multiplexing is high, and it is therefore possible to significantly improve the error rate characteristics of signals superimposed on subcarriers in which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction.",
        "A radio transmitting apparatus according to the present invention has a configuration wherein, of the above-described spreading sections, the spreading ratio of a spreading section that forms spread signals assigned in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction is set to a value greater than the spreading ratio of a spreading section that forms spread signals assigned only in the frequency axis direction.",
        "According to this configuration, since the spreading ratio of subcarriers in which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction is increased, the signal-to-noise ratio of spread signals superimposed on these subcarriers increases, and error rate characteristics improve. Also, as signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, even if the spreading ratio is increased, spread signals can be accommodated within the stipulated subcarrier frequency band, and the frequency band of other subcarriers need not be narrowed.",
        "A radio transmitting apparatus according to the present invention has a configuration further comprising first and second multiplexing sections that multiplex respective predetermined numbers of spread signals among the plurality of spread signals obtained by the above-described spreading sections, wherein the spread signal assigning section, when assigning in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, allocates signals multiplexed by the first and second multiplexing sections alternately in the time axis direction, and, within the same time, allocates a signal multiplexed by the first or second multiplexing section in the frequency axis direction.",
        "According to this configuration, on the receiving side that receives this OFDM-CDMA signal, it is only necessary to process code division multiplexed signals (symbols) of the same group in the same time\u2014that is, to perform processing from FFT (fast Fourier transform) onward only for symbols allocated to subcarriers of the same time\u2014thereby enabling power consumption to be reduced.",
        "As described above, according to the present invention an OFDM-CDMA radio transmitting apparatus and radio receiving apparatus are implemented that make it possible to make spectral efficiency compatible with error rate characteristics, by forming subcarriers to which spread signals are allocated only in the frequency axis direction, and subcarriers to which spread signals are allocated in both the frequency axis direction and the time axis direction, when performing radio transmission using the OFDM-CDMA method.",
