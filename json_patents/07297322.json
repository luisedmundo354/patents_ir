Further, the present invention enables to continuously produce the powders of metal compound containing oxygen with the use of the liquid material of high purity, the solution material prepared by dissolving solid ingredients of high purity in organic solvent. Accordingly, as described in Examples, it became possible to easily mass-produce the fine powders of metal compound containing oxygen as well as reducing the production cost.",
        "While there has been shown and described what are at present considered the preferred embodiments of the invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modification may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention defined by the appended claims."
