        "The present invention relates to pregnancy progress monitoring, more particularly, to an electronic device for helping a relative/friend of a pregnant woman keep track of the pregnancy progress.",
        "In many cultures, child conception and birth is a time when the mother and her family come together to celebrate. Relatives/friends may offer their support, knowledge, wisdom, care, and practical help to the new mother. However, in the absence of traditional family support systems and postpartum support rituals, our society is witnessing a frightening rise in pregnancy related illnesses, such as antenatal and postpartum symptoms (www.radiantmother.com). Postpartum symptoms are a complex mix of emotional, physical and behavioral changes that are very treatable by skilled professionals. In spite of this, many women who suffer do not recognize there is something wrong, and only 1 in 5 will report their symptoms and receive help.",
        "When new mothers are well informed, prepared and supported by family, friends, peers and professionals, they are less likely to experience overwhelming emotional distress during their pregnancy and postpartum months. Thus, there is a need for a simple, user friendly device that helps the new mother's family/friends track a pregnancy progress and provide support and an emotional bond during the pregnancy/postpartum period.",
        "The present invention provides methods and a device for storing and tracking a pregnancy progress and for keeping up to a predetermined number of sound recordings. The user of the device records up to nine sound recordings, wherein the sound recordings include a fetal heartbeat sound from a doctor's Doppler equipment, other personal messages from family or friends, and milestones (such as baby's first cry, first word, etc). The device includes a display screen that displays footprint icons, each of which corresponds to one of the sound recordings stored in the device, whereby the user can count the number of sound recordings stored in the device by counting the icons displayed on the display screen. The display screen also displays the pregnancy period from inception in weeks and days, and the countdown if the countdown is less than a predetermined number. During recording or playback of each sound recording, the display screen sequentially displays the footprint icons to perform an animation.",
        "In one aspect of the present invention, a device for tracking pregnancy progress includes: an input member actuatable by a user to record one or more sound recordings in the device; an audio member for playing back the sound recordings; and a display screen for displaying icons and pregnancy progress data, each icon corresponding to one of the sound recordings so that the user of the device is able to count the number of sound recordings recorded in the device by counting the icons.",
        "In another aspect of the present invention, a method for tracking a pregnancy progress using a device that includes a display screen includes steps of: causing the device to record one or more sound recordings in the device; causing the device to display icons on the display screen, each of the icons corresponding to one of the sound recordings recorded in the device so that the user of the device is able to count the sound recordings by counting the icons; causing the device to play the sound recordings; and causing the device to sequentially display the icons during recording or playback of each of the sound recordings.",
