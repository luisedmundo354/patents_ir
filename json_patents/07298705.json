Therefore, any reference to a packet herein can also refer to at least a frame, a cell, or a data packet, a data frame or a data cell.",
        "Further shown in FIG. 2, each port within the PE devices can be organized into groups of port(s) for one or more customer(s), wherein each organized group of port(s) can represent a VPLS domain for the TLS network system 15.

        "FIG. 3 illustrates one example of a hardware configuration of a PE device. The hardware configuration of Figure can be in an integrated, modular and single chip solution, and therefore can be embodied on a semiconductor substrate, such as silicon. Alternatively, the hardware configuration of FIG. 3 can be embodied in a plurality of discrete components on a circuit board.",
        "FIG. 3 shows a PE device that can include a double tagging loopback engine module 300, a network switching module A 305, a switch fabric module 310, a network switching module B 315, and a network switching module C 320. The double tagging loopback engine module 300 can have one switch fabric port SF pt A that can received information from and/or transmit information to a switch fabric module 310. In addition, the double tagging loopback engine module 300 can include an ingress/egress MAC loopback port (not shown), such as a 10 gigabit Ethernet port. The ingress/egress MAC loopback port can be an external port or a port within the DT loopback engine module 300, whereby one or more packet(s) can be \u201ctransmitted\u201d out of the egress of the DT loopback engine module through the ingress/egress MAC loopback port and can be looped back on the ingress of the same port back into the DT loopback engine module 300.",
        "The PE device of FIG. 3 also shows network switching module A 305, network switching module B 315, and network switching module C 320. Each of the network switching modules A, B and C can be a switching chip such as the network switching chips made commercially available through the Broadcom\u00ae Corporation. Additionally, each of the network switching modules A, B and C can have one or more customer facing ports, and one switch fabric port SF pt B, C, D. The customer facing ports can connect the PE device to the customers of a SPN. The SF ports B, C and D can received information from and/or transmit information to the switch fabric module 310. The customer facing ports and the SF ports B, C and D can be an ingress port as well as an egress port. Furthermore, network switching module A can have one or more uplink ports uplink pt 0 and uplink pt 1 that can be network facing ports for receiving information from and/or transmitting information to an Ethernet, such as the Internet. It is noted that although the example provided in FIG. 3 shows network switching module A as having uplink pt 0 and uplink pt 1, network switching modules B and C can be configured to include uplink pt 0 and uplink pt 1.",
        "The switch fabric module 310 can also be a switching chip such as the network switching chips made commercially available through the Broadcom\u00ae Corporation.",
        "Given the configuration shown in FIG. 3, an example of a packet flow within the configuration can be as follows. A packet can be received at uplink pt 0 of network switching module A 305. The packet can be processed at network switching module A 305 and can be forwarded to the switch fabric module 310 through the switch fabric port SF pt B. The packet can be received and processed at the switch fabric module 310. Thereafter, the switch fabric module 310 can forward the packet to the DT loopback engine module 300. The packet can be received at the switch fabric port SF pt A, and can be a high gigabit port (\u201cHigig port\u201d). The packet is processed and is forwarded out of the ingress/egress MAC loopback port (not shown) such as a 10 gigabit port. For example, the packet can be MAC looped back into the DT loopback engine module 300. In other words, the packet does not necessarily have to physically be transmitted out of the DT looback engine module 300 for the loop back to occur. Thus, the packet can loop back from the MAC, or in the alternative can loop back externally.",
        "Once the packet is looped back from the ingress of the 10 gigabit port, the packet can be processed based on a double tagging engine logic as explain further below. After the packet is processed, the packet is transmitted to the switch fabric module 310 and thereafter to one or more of the network switching module A, B and/or C. The packet can then be forwarded out of one or more specified customer facing ports.",
        "Another example of a packet flow within the configuration shown in FIG. 3 can be as follows. A packet can be received at any one of the customer facing ports of the network switching modules A, B or C. Suppose for this example a packet is received at one of the customer facing ports within network switching module B. The packet can be processed at network switching module A 305 and can be forwarded to the switch fabric module 310 through the switch fabric port SF pt C. The packet can be received and processed at the switch fabric module 310. Thereafter, the switch fabric module 310 can forward the packet to the DT loopback engine module 300. The packet can be received at the switch fabric port SF pt A or the Higig port. The packet is processed and is forwarded out of the egress MAC loopback port (not shown) and can be MAC looped back into the DT loopback engine module 300.",
        "Once the packet is looped back from the ingress of the 10 gigabit port, the packet can be processed based on a double tagging uplink logic as explain further below. After the packet is processed, the packet is transmitted to the switch fabric module 310 and thereafter to the network switching module A. The packet is then transmitted out to of either uplink pt 0 or uplink pt 1.",

        "The PE device 400 can be configured to include at least one uplink port. In this example, the PE device 400 of FIG. 4 shows two uplink ports, them being uplink pt 0 and uplink pt 1. Additionally, the PE device can have one or more customer facing port(s) or subscriber ports, pt 0, pt 1, pt 2 . . . pt n., and a MAC loopback port LB pt.

In addition, the customer facing ports pt 0, pt 1, pt 2 . . . pt n can be subscriber ports wherein each customer facing port can receive packets from and transmit packet to a particular VPLS customer having one or more VLANS as show in FIG. 1. Also, the MAC loopback port LB pt can be a 10 gigabit Ethernet port. The MAC loopback port can be an external port or a port within the DT loopback engine module 300, whereby one or more packet(s) can be \u201ctransmitted\u201d out of the egress of the DT loopback engine module through the ingress/egress MAC loopback port LB pt, and can be looped back on the ingress of the same port back into the DT loopback engine module 300.",

        "The destination address field can be a bit value that can be used by the receiving Media Access Controller (MAC), in order to determine if the incoming packet is addressed to the particular port. There can typically be three types of destination addresses (DA) i) unicast/individual or physical DA, ii) multicast or logical DA and iii) broadcast DA. The source address field can be a bit value and can be supplied by the transmitting MAC, which can inserts its own unique address into the source address field as the frame is transmitted, indicating it was the original station. The receiving MAC is not required to take action based on the source address field. Furthermore, the customer VLAN ID tag is a first packet tag inserted within the packet. The VLAN ID tag can identify a particular VLAN for a unique customer. In other words, if a customer has a plurality of VLANs, such as VLAN 1, VLAN 2, . . . VLANn, the customer VLAN ID tag can identify the packet as originating from one of the customer's VLANs. The T/L field can provide the type or the length of the packet. The payload P can contain the actual frame data that is being transferred.",
        "FIG. 5(b) illustrates one example of a packet 505 that can be received in or transmitted out of any one of an uplink pt 0 or uplink pt 1. The packet 510 can be configured to include, at least, a destination address field DA, a source address field SA, an SP VLAN ID tag, a customer VLAN identification tag VLAN ID, an Ether-type, a SP VLAN ID tag priority, an op-code and a payload P.",
        "Packet 505 can include an SP VLAN ID tag, which can be a second tag in the packet 510. SP VLAN ID tag can specify or identify a customer within the TLS network system 10. In other words, if a TLS network system 10 includes a plurality of customers, such as VPLS CUST A, VPLS CUST B, VPLS CUST C, and VPLS CUST D, the SP VLAN ID tag can identify the packet as originating from and belonging to a particular VPLS customer.",
        "Therefore, packet 505 can include at least a first tag, that being a customer VLAN ID tag, and a second tag, that being an SP VLAN ID tag. The SP VLAN ID tag can identify the packet as belonging to a particular VPLS customer, and the VLAN ID tag can identify the particular VLAN belonging to that VPLS customer. Accordingly, a packet having a first and second tag can always be identified as belonging to a unique VPLS customer, even if a plurality of the VPLS customer have overlapping or common VLAN IDs.",
        "In addition, FIG. 5(c) shows one example of a packet 510 that can contain a third packet tag such as an uplink VLAN tag. The third uplink VLAN tag can be appended to a packet within the PE device before the packet is looped back on the ingress of the MAC loopback port. The uplink VLAN tag can be configurable to identify the corresponding uplink port of a network switching module.",
        "The PE device of FIG. 4 can include a storage unit 402, such as a register. The storage unit 402 can be configured to store a one-bit DT loopback engine bit 403. The DT loopback engine bit 403 can either be set or not set by various way, such as preprogramming. For example, the DT loopback engine bit 403 can have either the value of \u201c1\u201d which sets the DT looback engine module, or the value of \u201c0\u201d which un-set the DT loopback engine module. When the DT loopback engine bit 403 is set, then DT engine loopback engine module is operating under double tagging loopback mode 65.",

The VLPS look-up table 406 can be indexed by a SP VLAN tag that correspond to a particular customer facing port, such as pt 0, pt 1, . . . pt n. In other words, each customer facing port of the PE device 400 can have a corresponding mask entry within the VPLS look-up table 406. Thus, each mask entry can be configured to have a VPLS port bit map 416 or a membership port bit map. The VPLS port bit map 416 can be a bit string having a bit length that can be equal, for example, to a number of ports with the PE device.

A known unicast packet can be a packet that is relayed or transmitted to only one known destination port. In contrast, a known multicast packet can be a packet that is relayed or transmitted to a multiple known destination ports. Moreover, an unknown unicast/multicast/broadcast packet can be a destination-lookup-failure packet. In other words, a received packet can be an unknown unicast/multicast/broadcast packet due to a failure in the destination address (DA) lookup for the packet received. Therefore, if the destination address lookup is not successful, then the destination port or ports with respect to the packet received is unknown.",
