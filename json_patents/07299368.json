        "This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/761,327 filed Jan. 22, 2004 entitled \u201cHigh Power Architecture for Power Over Ethernet\u201d, which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/512,362 filed Oct. 16, 2003 entitled \u201cPOWERED DEVICE ASIC\u201d the contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "The invention relates generally to the field of power over local area networks, particularly Ethernet based networks, and more particularly to an architecture enabling shared power from a plurality of power sources.",
        "The growth of local and wide area networks based on Ethernet technology has been an important driver for cabling offices and homes with structured cabling systems having multiple twisted wire pairs. The ubiquitous local area network, and the equipment which operates thereon, has led to a situation where there is often a need to attach a network operated device for which power is to be advantageously supplied by the network over the network wiring. Supplying power over the network wiring has many advantages including, but not limited to; reduced cost of installation; centralized power and power back-up; and centralized security and management.",
        "The IEEE 802.3af-2003 standard, whose contents are incorporated herein by reference, is addressed to powering remote devices over an Ethernet based network. The above standard is limited to a powered device (PD) having a maximum power requirement during operation of 12.95 watts. Power can be delivered to the PD either directly from the switch/hub known as an endpoint power sourcing equipment (PSE) or alternatively via a midspan PSE. Unfortunately, no provision has been made in the above standard for PDs requiring power in excess of the above maximum power requirement. It is understood by those skilled in the art, that the above power limitation is primarily a function of the power carrying capabilities of the installed twisted wire pairs being utilized to deliver power.",
        "Several patents addressed to the issue of supplying power to a PD over an Ethernet based network exist including: U.S. patent Ser. No. 6,473,608 issued to Lehr et al., whose contents are incorporated herein by reference; U.S. patent Ser. No. 6,643,1066 issued to Lehr et al., whose contents are incorporated herein by reference; and U.S. patent Ser. No. 6,1110,468 issued to De Nicolo whose contents are incorporated herein by reference. Each of the above mentioned patents similarly observe the above power limitation, since this limitation is a function of the power carrying capabilities of the twisted wire pairs being utilized.",
        "It would therefore be desirable to have an architecture enabling powering remote devices over an Ethernet network having high power needs.",
        "Accordingly, it is a principal object of the present invention to overcome the disadvantages of prior art in powering remote devices. This is provided in the present invention by an architecture enabling simultaneous power feeding from multiple sources over two sets of wire pairs, with power sharing being controlled by the operation of the power sourcing equipment.",
        "In particular the invention provides for a local area network adapted to supply power to at least one powered device over a plurality of communication cabling paths, the local area network comprising: a powered device; power sourcing equipment; and communication cabling comprising a plurality of twisted wire pairs connecting the power sourcing equipment to the powered device, the communication cabling providing a first power path comprising a first set of twisted wire pairs of the communication cabling and a second power path comprising a second set of twisted wire pairs of the communication cabling, the first set being different from the second set; the power sourcing equipment comprising: a control circuit; a first power source responsive to the control circuit adapted to supply a first power to the powered device via the first power path; a second power source responsive to the control circuit adapted to supply a second power to the powered device via the second power path, the control circuit being operative to control the first power source such that a current component of the first power is maintained within a pre-determined range.",
        "In one embodiment the predetermined range is a pre-determined limit of the difference between the current component of the first power and a current component of the second power. In another embodiment the pre-determined range is a pre-determined maximum, the maximum being less than a maximum allowable current from the first power source.",
        "In one embodiment the local area network further comprises a current sensing means associated with one of the first power source and the second power source, the current sensing means being operatively connected to the control circuit, the control circuit being operative responsive to the current sensing means. In another embodiment the local area network further comprises a voltage regulating means associated with one of the first power source and the second power source, the voltage regulating means being responsive to the control circuit, the control of the first power source being a result of the voltage regulating means. In one further embodiment the voltage regulating means comprises one of a linear regulator and a switching regulator, and in another further embodiment the voltage regulating means comprises an FET acting as a linear regulator.",
        "In one embodiment the local area network further comprises an unbalance resistor associated with one of the first power path and the second power path. In another embodiment the control circuit is further operative to control the second power source. In yet another embodiment the power sourcing equipment is associated with midspan power insertion equipment. In yet another embodiment the power sourcing equipment is associated with endpoint power insertion equipment.",
        "In one embodiment the communication cabling is adapted for communicating data to and from the powered device according to at least one of 10 Base-T, 100 Base-T and 1000 Base-T. In yet another embodiment local area network further comprises an under-voltage lockout circuit associated with the powered device, the under-voltage lockout circuit being operative to sense the supplied first power and the supplied second power, the under-voltage lockout circuit being further operative to enable power to the powered device responsive to the sensed supplied first power and the sensed supplied second power. In an exemplary embodiment the powered device comprises one of: a wireless access point; a laptop computer; a desk top computer; a security camera having at least one of pan, tilt and zoom functionality; and an entrance control device.",

        "In one embodiment the pre-determined range is a pre-determined limit of a difference between a current output of the first power source and a current output of the second power source. In another embodiment the pre-determined range is a pre-determined maximum, the maximum being less than a maximum allowed current.",

In another embodiment the voltage regulating means comprises an FET acting as a linear regulator. In yet another embodiment the power sourcing equipment further comprises an unbalance resistor associated with one of the first power source and the second power source.",
        "The invention also provides for a method for sharing power providing to a powered device over communication cabling, the method comprising: supplying a first power to a powered device over communication cabling; monitoring a current of the supplied first power; supplying a second power to the powered device over communication cabling; regulating a voltage associated with one of the supplied first power and the supplied second power responsive to the monitored current so as to maintain the monitored current within a pre-determined range.",
        "In one embodiment the pre-determined range is a pre-determined limit of a difference between the monitored current of the supplied first power and a current of the second power source. In another embodiment the pre-determined range is a pre-determined maximum, the maximum being less than a maximum allowed current. In yet another embodiment the method further comprises: monitoring a current of the supplied second power, wherein the pre-determined range is a predetermined limit of a difference between the monitored current of the supplied first power and the monitored current of the second power source.",

The use of an electronically controlled switch is advantageous, as in a typical PSE meeting the requirements of the IEEE 802.3af standard an electronically controlled switch is implemented to enable power to the port. Thus, a single electronically controlled switch implemented in an FET may be utilized to accomplish both the enabling requirements of the standard and as a voltage regulator means in accordance with the principle of the current invention.",
        "FIG. 8a illustrates a high level flow chart of a first embodiment of the operation of control circuit 970 of FIGS. 7a and 7b according to the principle of the current invention. The operation of control circuit 970 may be governed by a state machine, micro-controller, micro-computer or analog circuitry without exceeding the scope of the invention. In stage 1500 a first power source output is enabled and in stage 1510 a second power source output is enabled. It is to be understood that preferably stages 1500 and 1510 are accomplished after appropriate detection and optionally classification in accordance with the applicable standard. Further preferably stages 1500 and 1510 are accomplished substantially simultaneously to prevent current flow on a first path from saturating prior to enabling a second path.",
        "In stage 1520 the current component of one of the first and second paths is monitored. It is to be understood that the term current component is meant to comprise a current value or other indicator of the current output of the respective power source. In accordance with the embodiment of FIG. 7a this is accomplished by control circuit 970 monitoring the output of at least one of first and second current sensor 550. In accordance with the embodiment of FIG. 7b this is accomplished by control circuit 970 monitoring the output of second current sensor 550. In stage 1530 the monitored current component is compared with a pre-determined value. In an exemplary embodiment the pre-determined value is less than the maximum allowed output current according to the above mentioned IEEE 802.3af standard.",
        "In the event that in stage 1530 the monitored current component is not greater than or equal to the predetermined value, stage 1520 is performed as described above. In the event that in stage 1530 the monitored component is greater than or equal to the predetermined in stage 1540 the voltage regulating means associated with the monitored current component is operated to reduce the monitored current component. It is to be understood by those skilled in the art that the reduced current component will be supplied via the second path. In one embodiment this is accomplished in steps of discrete values. In another embodiment this is accomplished directly to yield a value less than the predetermined value. Stage 1520 is then performed as described above.",
        "Thus the operation according to FIG. 8a controls a monitored current component to be less than a pre-determined value. In the event that first through fourth twisted pair connections 60 of FIGS. 6a, 6b or the corresponding fifth through eighth twisted pair connections 60 of FIG. 6c are of a long length, it will be appreciated that typically control circuit 970 will not be required to reduce the current component via operation of voltage regulating means as current will be appropriately shared through an inherent droop.",
        "The operation according to FIG. 8a has been described as having the voltage regulating means associated with the same power source as the monitored component. This is not meant to be limiting in any way. In particular the voltage regulating means may be associated with the non-monitored current without exceeding the scope of the invention. In such an embodiment, current beneath a certain level may be indicative of an excess current in the other path.",
        "FIG. 8b illustrates a high level flow chart of a second embodiment of the operation of control circuit 970 of FIGS. 7a and 7b according to the principle of the current invention. The operation of control circuit 970 may be governed by a state machine, micro-controller, micro-computer or analog circuitry without exceeding the scope of the invention. In stage 1600 a first power source output is enabled and in stage 1610 a second power source output is enabled. It is to be understood that preferably stages 1600 and 1610 are accomplished after appropriate detection and optionally classification in accordance with the applicable standard. Further preferably stages 1600 and 1610 are accomplished substantially simultaneously to prevent current flow on a first path from saturating prior to enabling a second path.",
        "In stage 1620 the current component of both first and second paths is monitored. In accordance with the embodiments of FIG. 7a, 7b this is accomplished by control circuit 970 monitoring the output of both first and second current sensor 550. In stage 1630 the monitored current components are compared with a pre-determined range. In an exemplary embodiment the range represents positive and negative values small enough to be considered negligible. In another embodiment the range represents positive and negative values for which it is considered unnecessary to operate the voltage regulating means. It is to be understood the operation of voltage regulating means results in lost power, as the voltage drop across the voltage regulating means results in a power drop across the voltage regulating means.",
        "In the event that in stage 1630 the monitored current components are within the pre-determined range, stage 1620 is performed as described above. In the event that in stage 1630 the monitored components are not within the predetermined range in stage 1640 the voltage regulating means associated with the greater monitored current component is operated to reduce the monitored current component. It is to be understood by those skilled in the art that the reduced current component will be supplied via the other path. In one embodiment this is accomplished in steps of discrete values. In another embodiment this is accomplished directly to yield a value less than the pre-determined range. Stage 1620 is then performed as described above. Thus the operation according to FIG. 8b controls both monitored current component to be within a pre-determined range.",
