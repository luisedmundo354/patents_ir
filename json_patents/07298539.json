        "This present invention relates generally to manufacturing objects. More particularly, the invention relates to a method and structure for fabricating a spatial light modulator with a co-planar surface and torsion device. Merely by way of example, the invention has been applied to the formation of a spatial light modulator having a torsion spring and mirror plate positioned in the same plane. The method and device can be applied to spatial light modulators as well as other devices, for example, micro-electromechanical sensors, detectors, and displays.",
        "Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) are used in a number of application areas. For example, MEMS have been used in micro-mirror arrays, sensors, and actuators. In some of these applications, a suspended member is supported by a flexible hinge attached to a stationary portion of the mirco-mirror array. Flexibly attached to the hinge, the suspended member is attracted to an electrode upon application of an electrical force and restored to an original position by a restoring force. In this manner, the array of micro-mirrors can be tilted in relation to a light source. In some applications, it is beneficial to have the hinge located beneath the micro-mirror surface in a hidden position, enabling the fill factor of the array to be increased. As the fill factor of the micro-mirror array is increased, the potential quality of two-dimensional images created by optical systems using the array is improved.",
        "As merely an example, some conventional MEMS have utilized various micro-mirror designs, such as micro-mirrors mounted on flexible pedestals coupled to the backside of the micro-mirror surface. In some of these designs, the flexible pedestals extending from the mirror substrate are bonded to a control substrate using a wafer bonding process. However, in these designs, the reliability and repeatability of the process of bonding the flexible posts to the control substrate may be reduced due to the small surface areas joined during the bonding process. Thus, there is a need in the art for methods and apparatus for an improved support structure adapted to couple mirror devices to a control substrate.",

        "FIG. 1 is a diagram that illustrates the general architecture of a spatial light modulator (SLM) 100. The illustrated embodiment has three layers. The first layer is a mirror array 103 that has a plurality of deflectable micro-mirrors 202. In a preferred embodiment, the micro-mirror array 103 is fabricated from a first substrate 105 that is a single material, such as single crystal silicon. An example of one way of forming this SLM is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/378,056, filed Feb. 27, 2003, commonly owned, and hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.",
        "The second layer is an electrode array 104 with a plurality of electrodes 126 for controlling the micro-mirrors 202. Each electrode 126 is associated with a micro-mirror 202 and controls the deflection of that micro-mirror 202. Addressing circuitry allows selection of a single electrode 126 for control of the particular micro-mirror 202 associated with that electrode 126.",
        "The third layer is a layer of control circuitry 106. This control circuitry 106 has addressing circuitry, which allows the control circuitry 106 to control a voltage applied to selected electrodes 126. This allows the control circuitry 106 to control the deflections of the mirrors 202 in the mirror array 103 via the electrodes 126. Typically, the control circuitry 106 also includes a display control 108, line memory buffers 110, a pulse width modulation array 112, and inputs for video signals 120 and graphics signals 122. A microcontroller 114, optics control circuitry 116, and a flash memory 118 may be external components connected to the control circuitry 106, or may be included in the control circuitry 106 in some embodiments. In various embodiments, some of the above listed parts of the control circuitry 106 may be absent, may be on a separate substrate and connected to the control circuitry 106, or other additional components may be present as part of the control circuitry 106 or connected to the control circuitry 106.",
        "In an embodiment according to the present invention, both the second layer 104 and the third layer 106 are fabricated using semiconductor fabrication technology on a single second substrate 107. That is, the second layer 104 is not necessarily separate and above the third layer 106. Rather, the term \u201clayer\u201d is an aid for conceptualizing different parts of the spatial light modulator 100. For example, in one embodiment, both the second layer 104 of electrodes is fabricated on top of the third layer of control circuitry 106, both fabricated on a single second substrate 107. That is, the electrodes 126, as well as the display control 108, line memory buffers 110, and the pulse width modulation array 112 are all fabricated on a single substrate in one embodiment. Integration of several functional components of the control circuitry 106 on the same substrate provides an advantage of improved data transfer rate over conventional spatial light modulators, which have the display control 108 line memory buffers 110, and the pulse width modulation array 112 fabricated on a separate substrate. Further, fabricating the second layer of the electrode array 104 and the third layer of the control circuitry 106 on a single substrate 107 provides the advantage of simple and cheap fabrication, and a compact final product. After the layers 103, 104, and 106 are fabricated, they are bonded together to form the SLM 100. Additional examples of methods for joining the substrates to form a bonded substrate structure are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/756,923, filed Jan. 13, 2004, commonly owned, and hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 1, the substrate 105 includes a number of standoff regions extending from a lower portion of the substrate and arranged in an array as a waffle pack grid pattern. The standoff regions are adapted to align with bonding areas located between adjacent electrodes 126. Mirrors 202 are formed in the upper layers of substrate 105 by a release process in later stages of processing. In some designs, the standoff regions provide mechanical support for the mirror structure and are not moveable. Thus, light reflected from the upper surfaces of the standoff structures reduces the contrast of the optical system incorporating the spatial light modulator. In some designs, an absorbent material may be applied to the upper surfaces of the standoff regions to reduce reflections. However, these approaches reduce the fill factor of the array, potentially degrading system performance.",

This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives. As illustrated in FIG. 2A, a portion of CMOS substrate 310 includes electrodes 312, landing pads 314, and bonding surface 520. Standoff structure 645 includes an integrated surface 210 coupled to the lower surface (not shown) of the mirror layer 640 and a bonding surface (not shown) opposite the integrated surface 210. The standoff structure 645 also includes centrally located base section 650 extending from the integrated surface to the bonding surface along a first axis and lateral extension arms 642 extending from the base section along a second axis orthogonal to the first axis. As further illustrated in FIG. 2A, the first axis is aligned with the z-axis and the extension arms extend from the base section along the x-axis. Of course, this arrangement is not required by the present invention. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2A, a torsion beam is defined in the mirror layer 640 by openings 690 along with openings 682a and 682b. In an embodiment of the present invention, the torsion beam includes two torsion spring arms 684a and 684b that extend away from two sides of central base section 686. As illustrated, the torsion spring arms are coplanar with the mirror layer 640 and extend along the x-axis. Each of the torsion spring arms are fixed to the central base section and the mirror plate at the diagonal corners of the mirror plate. Accordingly, the mirror layer 640 is free to rotate in the y-z plane in response to activation of the electrodes 312. As the mirror layer rotates about the x-axis, a restoring torque is present in the torsion beam. Of course, this geometry is only one of a number of geometries provided by embodiments of the present invention.",

As illustrated in FIG. 2B, mirror layer 640 has been inverted and electrode substrate 310 has been omitted, showing the bonding surface 220 of the standoff structure 645 and the underside of mirror layer 640. As will be described more fully below, the mirror substrate including the mirror layer 640 and the standoff structure 645 is wafer bonded to substrate 310 in a specific embodiment of the present invention. Referring to the illustration provided in FIG. 2B, bonding surface 220 extends along the entire face of the standoff structure and is bonded to bonding surface 520 using techniques described more fully below. Subsequently, mirror layer 640 and standoff structure 645 are preferentially etched from the upper side of the mirror layer to form openings 690 and remove the support provided by standoff structure 645 for portions of the mirror layer 640.",
        "As described with reference to FIG. 6B below, a layer of a composite substrate structure is processed to form the standoff structure 645. In the illustrated embodiment, the standoff structure is fabricated using an etching process that terminates at the underside of layer 640. As illustrated, extension arms 642 extend from opposite sides of central section 650. In particular, adjacent arms 242 and 244 are separated by openings 240. The dimensions of the standoff structure, in particular the height to which the structure extends from layer 640, the dimensions of central section 650, the width and length of the extension arms, and the spacing 240 between the arms are predetermined according to embodiments of the present invention.",
        "FIG. 2C is a simplified perspective illustration of a standoff structure at an intermediate stage of processing according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the embodiment of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 2C, the standoff structure includes a release section 260 that is removed during a release step. Additional details of the fabrication process are discussed below. Initially integrally formed with the mirror layer, the release section 260 includes portions extending along both sets of extension arms 642. The thickness 262 of the release section is defined during the release step and is typically a function of the etch process used to remove the release section, as described more fully below. In some embodiments, the thickness 262 is selected to ensure that the mirror plate does not make contact with the extension arms 642 when the mirror is placed in an activated state. As illustrated in FIG. 2C, the upper surface 220 of the standoff structure, which is an integrated layer coupled to the mirror layer, has a smaller surface area than the lower surface 270 of the standoff structure, which is bonded to the second substrate as described more fully below. As illustrated in FIG. 2C, the lower surface area of the standoff structure is equal to the surface area of the extension arms plus the surface area of the surface 830.",
        "In some embodiments the strength of the bond per unit area between the standoff structure and the second substrate is less than the strength of the bond between layer 220 and the mirror due to the integrated nature of the interface. However, because of the ratio of areas between surfaces 220 and 270, the total strength of the bond and material are balanced and may be equal or different. For example, the presence of voids between surface 270 and the electrode substrate is counteracted by the bond area provided by the extension arms 642.",
        "FIGS. 3A-3B are simplified side-view illustrations of a portion of a spatial light modulator according to an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 3A, a micro-mirror 320 is symmetrically located with respect to standoff structure 330 and is illustrated in an unactivated position.

For example, the power reflectance of portions of upper surface 326 may be greater than or equal to 90%. Moreover, in an embodiment according to the present invention, the flexible member is a vertical torsion spring, in which the height of the hinge is greater than the width, but this is not required by the present invention. Alternative embodiments according to the present invention use other flexible members that bend in response to applied forces and subsequently return to their original shape after removal of such applied forces.",

In FIG. 3, the torque lies in the plane of the figure. In an embodiment according to the present invention, at least one landing pad 314b is adapted to make contact with the micro-mirror at location 340. The landing pad is fabricated from suitable materials as described above.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 3B, the right side of the micro-mirror makes contact with landing pad 314b. However, this is not required by the present invention. An example of one way of utilizing landing pads and landing posts to reduce the amount and impact of contact between the micro-mirror and the first surface is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/718,482, filed Nov. 19, 2003, commonly owned, and hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.

        "Although FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate a micro-mirror transitioning between an unactivated (horizontal) state and an activated (tilted) state, this is not required by the present invention. In alternative embodiments, the micro-mirror transitions between states in which the mirror is tilted in opposite directions. In embodiments according to the present invention, the height and position of the standoff structure are selected so that the upper surface of the micro-mirror is tilted at a predetermined angle with respect to the horizontal when the micro-mirror is in the activated state. For example, the mirror may transition from a state in which the micro-mirror is tilted at 12\u00b0 to the horizontal as illustrated in FIG. 3B and a state in which the micro-mirror is tilted at an angle of \u221212\u00b0 to the horizontal.

Of course, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives.",
        "Comparison of FIGS. 1 and 3 will illustrate one of the benefits provided by embodiments of the present invention. Since the spatial light modulator in FIG. 3 is centrally supported by standoff structure 330, rather than a waffle pack grid structure surrounding micro-mirrors 320, the fill factor of an array of spatial light modulators fabricated according to embodiments of the present invention, which is a function of the gap between adjacent micro-mirrors, can be higher than in some alternative designs. In embodiments in which the openings 680a and 680b are defined using well developed photolithographic processes, the dimensions of the openings are generally well-controlled and may be as small as sub-micron dimensions. Accordingly, high fill factors are available using embodiments of the present invention.",

As illustrated in FIG. 4, a number of micro-mirrors are arranged in a spatial pattern to form a two-dimensional array. The micro-mirrors, supported by the standoff structures and torsion spring hinges as described above, are laterally separated by air gaps 410. For purposes of clarity, FIG. 4 provides an illustration in which portions of the spatial light modulator are omitted as a function of position to illustrate the three-dimensional nature of the spatial light modulator according to embodiments of the present invention.",
        "As described above, because the air gaps between adjacent mirrors are formed using photolithograph processes, the spacing between adjacent mirrors is a predetermined distance. For example, in an embodiment, the air gap 410 is 0.8 \u03bcm. In other embodiments, the air gap 410 ranges from about 0.3 \u03bcm to about 1.0 \u03bcm. Of course, the particular air gap will depend on the particular application and may not be the same on all sides of a particular micro-mirror. The fill-factor of a micro-mirror array, defined as the area of the reflective surfaces divided by the total area of the array, increases as the gap between adjacent micro-mirrors decreases. In display applications, increases in fill-factor typically result in improvement in the image quality produced by the spatial light modulator.

Alternative embodiments employ atmospheric or low pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process to form the dielectric layer. The dielectric layer may be planarized after deposition, for example, by using a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process to form a uniform upper dielectric surface for the layer from which the dielectric bond pads are formed. Planarization processes for dielectric layers utilized in multilevel interconnect applications are well known to one of skill in the art.",

In alternative embodiments according to the present invention, the thickness and composition of the deposited layer or layers of material 664 is varied, utilizing other materials that conduct electricity and reflect light in the visible region.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 6F, multi-layer stack 664 provides a reflective coating on the upper surface of layer 640. As described more fully below, portions of layer 640 are processed to form micro-mirrors, which reflect light incident from above layer 640. Thus, the upper layer of stack 664 illustrated in FIG. 6F, which includes an aluminum layer, provides a high reflectivity coating for the mirror surface suitable for reflecting incident radiation in the visible region.",
        "Moreover, since the deposited material passes through insulating dielectric layer 520, layer 665 provides for electrical connection between the mirrors formed in portions of layer 640 and a bias grid (not shown) coupled to support pads 316. As illustrated in FIG. 6F, material 665 and support pads 316 are coupled at the upper surface of the TiN layer deposited as the upper portion of support pads 316. Thus, structures 664 and 665 provide not only a reflective coating on the upper surface of layer 640, but also provide for an electrical connection between the mirror surface and the bias grid.",
        "In some embodiments, the bias grid is present on the same masking level as the electrodes 312 and support pads 316. In alternative embodiments, the bias grid is present on another level, for example, the same masking level as metals deposited and patterned prior to electrodes 312 and support pads 316. In these alternative embodiments, the bias grid is electrically connected to the support pads 316 through the use of vias, reducing the number of physical structures present at the electrodes masking level and simplifying the electrical design. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives. As the structure 664 is present on the upper surface of the hinges extending toward the corners of the micro-mirror, the multi-layer stack provides electrical connectivity between the bias grid and the entire mirror surface. Semiconductor processing techniques suitable for enhancing the electrical contact between the conductive layer 664/665 and the support pads 316 are well known to one of skill in the art, including plasma treatment after formation of openings 660 and prior to deposition of the first layer making up the multi-layer stack 664/665.",
        "Although in some embodiments, layers 664 and 665 are distinguishable, in other embodiments, a single reflective and conductive material is used both to fill the openings 645 and coat the surface of layer 640. Moreover, in some embodiments, the material 665 does not completely fill the openings 645, but still provides a continuous electrical path from the bias grid to the layer 664.",
        "FIG. 6G illustrates a spatial light modulator at a further stage of a fabrication process according to an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, layer 640 has been patterned using photolithographic processes and processed to form a number of openings 680a, 680b, 682a, and 682b, creating a number of micro-mirrors 670. Although FIG. 6G illustrates a cross-sectional view of the mirror structures, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a three-dimensional structure is represented by the figure. Openings 680 provide for separation between adjacent micro-mirrors. As discussed in relation to FIG. 4, the fill-factor for the micro-mirror array is a function of the gap between adjacent mirrors. Because the openings 680 are defined using well developed photolithographic processes, the dimensions of the openings are generally well-controlled and may be as small as sub-micron dimensions. Openings 680 separate adjacent mirrors from each other, enabling for mirror rotation as described below.",
        "Also illustrated in FIG. 6G and FIG. 6H are openings 682a and 682b formed in layer 640. Openings 682 partially define a torsion spring hinge along section 684 of micro-mirror 670. As shown in FIG. 2A, openings 680 cooperate with openings 690 to form a torsion beam coupled to mirror layer 640. As illustrated in FIG. 6H, the torsion beam, sometimes referred to as a torsion spring hinge, couples the micro-mirrors 670 to a central portion of standoff structure 645. In a specific embodiment, the openings 682 and 690 are formed in layer 640 and selected portions of standoff structures 645 to release the micro-mirror in a manner to allow for rotation of the mirror around an axis. Referring to both FIG. 6H and FIG. 2A, portions of the extension arms 642 initially coupled to the mirror surface at locations 690 are removed during the release process. In other words, sections 690 of the mirror layer are removed along with attached sections of the extension arms, exposing surfaces 692 on the extension arms. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 6H, the width of the torsion spring 684 measured along a direction (the y-direction) perpendicular to the length of the hinge (the z-direction) is a predetermined distance. In one specific embodiment, the width of the torsion spring hinge is 0.18 \u03bcm. In an alternative embodiment, the width ranges from about 0.1 \u03bcm to about 0.5 \u03bcm. The thickness of the torsion beam, measured in the z-direction, is equal to the thickness of layer 640 as illustrated in FIG. 6D.",
        "As a result of the fabrication process described in relation to this embodiment, the centrally located base section extends to a greater z-height than the extension arms as illustrated in FIG. 2A. Thus, in this embodiment, the mirror layer 640 and the standoff structure 645 are in contact at the centrally located base section 210 while other sections of the upper portion of the standoff structure (namely the extension arms) have been removed. The removal process is performed to provide sufficient clearance between the upper portions 692 of the standoff structure and the mirror layer 640 for the mirror to rotate freely under the influence of an applied electric field and placed in an activated state. In the activated state, the torsion force present in the torsion beam provides a restoring force to return the mirror to the unactivated state after removal of the applied electric field. Moreover, because of the spacer (reference numeral 240 in FIG. 2B and reference numeral 622 in FIG. 6B) formed between adjacent extension arms, the majority of section 684 of the torsion beam is not coupled to the standoff structure, but functions as a torsion spring for mirror 670.",
        "The standoff structures employed in embodiments of the present invention provide a mounting surface for the micro-mirror with material properties and dimensions that facilitate bonding of substrates 310 and 610. In some substrate bonding processes, voids are formed at the bond interface, weakening the bond and presenting reliability problems. Embodiments of the present invention reduce the adverse impacts of voids possibly formed at the bond interface. For example, referring to FIG. 2B, the interface between the mirror layer 640 and the standoff structure 645 is fabricated from a single piece of material in the illustrated embodiment. In a particular embodiment, the interface between the mirror layer 640 and the standoff structure 645 is fabricated from a single crystal silicon substrate. Typically, the single crystal silicon substrate is formed as the substrate is cut from a boule or through an epitaxial process, providing a continuous material interface characterized by uniformity at the interface. For this interface, the void density is typically zero as a result of the substrate fabrication processes. Accordingly, the mechanical properties of the material at the interface between the mirror layer and the standoff structure, including the interface strength, are optimal.",
        "Referring once again to FIGS. 2A and 2B, the characteristics of the interface between the standoff structure 645 and the bond pad 520 are a function of the substrate bonding process (or processes) used to join the substrates and form the composite substrate structure. Generally, the substrate bonding process is selected to reduce the number of voids formed at the bond interface. However, in embodiments of the present invention, the dimensions of the lower portions of the standoff structure provide a robust bond, even in the presence of some voids. As illustrated in FIGS. 2A and 2B, the outer dimensions of the lower portion of the standoff structure are approximately 14 \u03bcm by 2 \u03bcm. In particular, the dimensions of the extension arms 642 are approximately 14 \u03bcm by 0.6 \u03bcm, providing a bonding surface that is able to tolerate a number of voids without significant impact on interface strength and reliability.",
        "Moreover, the geometry of the standoff structure and torsion spring hinge are not limited to the geometry illustrated in FIG. 2. In alternative embodiments of the present invention, the shape and dimensions of the standoff structure and torsion spring hinge are modified as appropriate to other applications. In some embodiments, the width of the extension arms 642 are increased to provide additional surface area for the substrate bonding process, thereby increasing the reliability of the bond between the standoff structure and the second substrate. In other embodiments, the width and length of the centrally located base section is increased to increase the surface area of the integrated interface between the upper portion of the standoff structure and the mirror layer. Furthermore, the dimensions of the torsion spring hinge are variable and may be selected to achieve system goals such as flexibility and reliability of the hinge.",
        "FIG. 7 is a simplified flowchart illustrating one method of fabricating a spatial light modulator according to an embodiment of the present invention. Process 700 includes providing a first substrate having a mirror layer in step 710. As described previously, in a specific embodiment, the first substrate is a multi-layer substrate structure, such as a SOI substrate. The dimensions of the layers making up the multi-layer substrate are selected to satisfy various design constraints. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, a silicon layer is provided that is thick enough to form a mirror layer integrated with a standoff structure. The surfaces of the SOI substrate are polished in some embodiments to facilitate substrate bonding processes in subsequent processing steps.",
        "Step 712 includes forming a standoff structure from the first substrate. In some embodiments, the standoff structure is formed by an etching process. In this embodiment, a surface of the first substrate is masked and etched to form a standoff structure extending from the first substrate. Typically, a mask is generated to define the portion of the first substrate that will be etched to form the standoff structures. Standard techniques, such as photolithography, can be used to generate the mask on the first substrate. As mentioned previously, in an embodiment the micro-mirrors and standoff structures are formed from a single material, such as single crystal silicon. The structures fabricated to create the micro-mirrors and standoff structures are typically larger than the features used in CMOS circuitry, so it is relatively easy to form the micro-mirrors and standoff structures using known techniques for fabricating CMOS circuitry.",
        "After the mask is generated, the first substrate is anisotropically etched in an embodiment to form the standoff structures. Other methods besides an anisotropic etch may also be used to form the standoff structures, such as a wet etch or a plasma etch. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives. Because the unetched surface of the standoff structure is masked during fabrication, this surface provides a bonding surface for subsequent substrate bonding processes. As mentioned previously, the polished substrate surface, present at the unetched surface of the standoff structure, provides a high quality bonding surface.",
        "A second substrate is provided in step 714. Typically, the second substrate is an electrode substrate, e.g. a CMOS substrate, including a number of electrodes and bond pads. In embodiments according to the present invention, the second substrate includes a bonding surface adapted to align with the standoff structures fabricated on the first substrate. In some embodiments, the bonding surface is a dielectric bond pad formed in contact with the second substrate, but this is not required by the present invention. In other embodiments, the bonding surface is a portion of the second substrate. The bonding surface associated with the second substrate is typically polished or otherwise fabricated to provide a smooth surface suitable for substrate bonding processes.",
        "In step 716, the bonding surface of the standoff structure is joined to the bonding surface of the second substrate. The first substrate and the second substrate are aligned so that the electrodes on the second substrate are in a proper position to control the deflection of the micro-mirrors formed in subsequent processing steps on the first substrate. In an embodiment, the two substrates are optically aligned using double focusing microscopes by aligning a pattern on the first substrate with a pattern on the second substrate and the two substrates are bonded together by low temperature bonding methods such as anodic or eutectic bonding. There are many possible alternate embodiments to the bonding process illustrated by step 716. For example, thermoplastics or dielectric spin glass bonding materials may be used so that that substrates are bonded thermo-mechanically.",
        "After bonding the first and second substrate together, the surface of the first substrate opposite the standoff structures is thinned to a predetermined thickness in step 718. First, the handling layer 615 is removed, typically by grinding or etching. Then the insulating layer 620 is removed. Then the device layer 630 is thinned or polished, if necessary. This thinning is done in an embodiment by mechanically grinding the first substrate to a thickness that is near the desired thickness of the micro-mirror. For example, in this embodiment, the thickness achieved by mechanical grinding is approximately 5 microns. The first substrate is then polished by mechanical fine polishing or chemical mechanical polishing to the thickness desired for the micro-mirror layer. In an embodiment according to the present invention, this desired thickness is less than approximately 1 \u03bcm. In a specific embodiment, this desired thickness is 0.3 \u03bcm.",
        "In step 720, the first substrate is masked and processed to release a portion of the first substrate to form a torsion beam or torsion spring hinge that is coplanar with the micro-mirror layer. Referring to FIGS. 2A and 6H, in an embodiment, a high-aspect-ratio anisotropic etching process is used to define the mirror plate 670, the torsion spring hinge 684, and the centrally located base section 686. The release step removes a portion 682 of the mirror layer adjacent to the centrally located base section as well as a portion of the mirror layer 690 and the portions of the extension arms above surface 692 of the extension arms. Thus, the centrally located base section provides a connector between the torsion spring hinge coupled to the mirror plate and the standoff structure bonded to the second substrate. Additionally, the release step 720 includes the separation of adjacent mirrors from each other, represented by openings 680 in FIGS. 6G and 6H. In an embodiment, the width of release section 682 is 0.2 \u03bcm. In alternative embodiments, the width varies from about 0.1 \u03bcm to about 1.0 \u03bcm. Moreover, in some embodiments, the release sections 690 extend to about 1 \u03bcm from the corner of the mirror.",
