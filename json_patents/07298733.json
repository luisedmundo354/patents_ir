        "This invention relates to a wireless communication apparatus for transmitting and receiving such as voice data (data for displaying moving pictures or 3D graphics is similarly applicable as data having a real-time characteristic), an internet communication system, in which voice data is transmitted and received over the Internet between a calling party's wireless communication apparatus and a called party's wireless communication apparatus, and its internet communication method. More specifically, this invention relates to an internet communication system, which is provided with a calling party's session managing server for managing a calling party's wireless communication apparatus and a called party's session managing server for managing a called party's wireless communication apparatus, and its internet communication method.",
        "In addition, this invention relates to a session managing server, which is connected with the calling party's wireless communication apparatus and the called party's wireless communication apparatus, for managing both the wireless communication apparatuses of a calling party and a called party, and a program, which operates on the session managing server.",
        "Furthermore, this invention relates to a wireless communication apparatus, which is connected with the calling party's session managing server and the called party's session managing server, for communicating with both the session managing servers of the calling party and the called party, and a program, which operates on the wireless communication apparatus.",
        "Still further, this invention relates to an internet communication system, which carries out data communications between two of the calling party's wireless communication apparatus, a calling party's communication relay server, the called party's wireless communication apparatus and a called party's communication relay server, by using a predetermined communication procedure, and its internet communication method.",
        "Still more, this invention relates to a communication relay server, which carries out data communications between a wireless communication apparatus and a server apparatus by using a predetermined communication procedure, and a program, which operates on the communication relay server.",
        "According to an Internet telephone network system, in which voice data is transmitted and received over the Internet, including a wireless network, with a wireless communication apparatus disposed as a terminal device, IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are allocated for communication to the wireless communication apparatuses of a calling party and a called party. It is to be noted that an IP address is an address for discriminating between a transmission source and a destination in TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) communications. IP addresses include a global IP address, which has a globally unique identification attribute, and a local IP address (or a private IP address in some cases), which is set up by the user privately. However, it is to be noted that \u201cIP address\u201d used by itself hereinafter, means a global IP address.",
        "In addition, it is to be noted that when a calling party's wireless communication apparatus and a called party's wireless communication apparatus communicate with each other, a relay server may be provided for relaying communications between the calling party's wireless communication apparatus and the called party's wireless communication apparatus. For example, in the case where the called party is in the wireless network environment where it is protected by the firewall, an appropriate communication means may be selected according to the wireless network environment of the called party to connect the calling party and the called party by the relay server.",
        "Furthermore, it is to be noted that in the case where the wireless network apparatus of the called party is arranged in a lower layer than an ADSL (Asymmetric digital subscriber line) connection apparatus, an address may be allocated dynamically, or a local IP address may be allocated. In this case, the calling party's wireless communication apparatus may be in the network environment where it is not allowed to be connected with the called party's wireless communication apparatus directly. In such a network environment, an appropriate communication means may be selected according to the network environment of the called party to connect the calling party and the called party by the relay server.",
        "Still further, it is to be noted that the wireless communication apparatus may be arranged in a lower layer, which is set by a router apparatus, in a variety of wireless internet connection environments such as CATV (Cable Television), FTTH (Fiber To The Home), the Internet apartment and so forth as well as ADSL. In this case, the address of the wireless communication apparatus is allocated dynamically or a local IP address is assigned to the wireless communication apparatus. As a result, the calling party's wireless communication apparatus may not be allowed to be connected with the called party's wireless communication apparatus directly. In such a network environment, an appropriate communication means may be selected according to the wireless network environment of the called party to connect the calling party and the called party by the relay server.",
        "FIG. 27 shows a block diagram of an internet telephone network system, which is disclosed in PCT/JP1/04003. (This PCT application has a filing date of May 15, 2001. Refer to the application of PCT/JP1/04003 for further details thereof.",
        "Or, the application of PCT/JP1/04003 is incorporated herein by reference.) Reference numerals 910 and 920 in FIG. 27 denote telephone sets, which are connected with telephone adapters 912 and 922 through indoor telephone lines 911 and 912, respectively. A relay server 918 is provided between the telephone sets 910 and 920 for relaying the transmission and reception of call data. The relay server 918 consists of a plurality of HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) relay servers 918a and 918b, and an HTTP relay server managing server 980 which manages the HTTP relay server. In addition, the relay server 918 is connected with the telephone sets 910 and 920 over the Internet 16. Assuming that the telephone set 910 is in the calling party and the telephone set 920 is in the called party, when a connection is made by the calling party with the called party for a call, the relay server managing server 980 receives a call request from the calling party over the Internet. The HTTP relay server managing server 980 selects an HTTP relay server available for relaying based on the call request received. A selected HTTP relay server relays a communication between the calling party and the called party.",
        "In such a system, a single unit of HTTP relay server managing server manages all the telephone adapters and HTTP relay servers to implement communication relaying.",
        "According to the above mentioned internet telephone network system, if telephone adapters become more popular and some hundreds of thousands of telephone adapters come to be installed all over Japan and all over the world, it is impossible for a single unit of relay server managing server to manage all the relay servers and telephone adapters issuing call requests. This poses a problem in the implementation of the system. Another possible problem is that, even if the relay server managing server is capable of managing all the relay servers, the quality of services, which can be offered may be degraded.",
        "It is an object of this invention, for example, to make a communication system operable even in the case where the number of wireless communication apparatuses is increased.",
        "Furthermore, mobile phone penetration shows a remarkable growth in recent years, where wireless Internet service of mobile phones, etc. started in February 1999. The number of wireless Internet service users continues to grow rapidly. On the other hand, mobile phone calls are charged at a meter rate in the same way as regular and public phone calls. A growing number of Internet services provide a constant Internet access environment for fixed monthly fee these days. Also for mobile phones, some Internet services can be provided on a fixed monthly fee basis. Thus, mobile phone services can be used at low cost if such fixed monthly fee based Internet communication paths for data are used in voice communications. However, it is not possible in the current mobile Internet environment to allocate a fixed global IP address dynamically to a communication apparatus. In addition, it would not be possible to build Internet telephone system in the current IP phone standards based mobile environment without penetration of new Internet protocol standards such as IPv6 (Internet Protocok Version 6) and Mobile IP.",
        "An objective of the present invention is to allow it possible to manage Internet telephone systems in the mobile environment of mobile phones, etc. only through current Internet protocol standards in widespread use instead of using new Internet protocol standards such as IPv6 and Mobile IP.",
        "An internet communication system according to this invention, which carries out data communications by using the Internet, is characterized by including a calling party's wireless communication apparatus; a calling party's wireless base station apparatus connecting the calling party's wireless base station and the Internet, and converting between wireless communication and wired communication; a called party's wireless communication apparatus; a called party's wireless base station apparatus connecting the called party's wireless base station and the Internet, and converting between the wireless communication and the wired communication; a calling party's session managing server which manages the calling party's wireless communication apparatus; and a called party's session managing server which manages the called party's wireless communication apparatus. The calling party's wireless communication apparatus may transmit the wireless communication apparatus ID of the called party's wireless communication apparatus to the calling party's session managing server via the calling party's wireless base station apparatus. The calling party's session managing server may receive the wireless communication apparatus ID of the called party's wireless communication apparatus from the calling party's wireless communication apparatus, and transmits back to the calling party's wireless communication apparatus the server ID of the called party's session managing server managing the called party's wireless communication apparatus which is identified by the wireless communication apparatus ID. The calling party's wireless communication apparatus may receive the server ID of the called party's session managing server from the calling party's session managing server via the calling party's wireless base station apparatus, transmit the wireless communication apparatus ID of the called party's wireless communication apparatus to the called party's session managing server which is identified by the server ID received, and transmit an establishment request of a session with the called party's wireless communication apparatus. The called party's session managing server may receive the wireless communication apparatus ID of the called party's wireless communication apparatus from the calling party's wireless communication apparatus, and store that the establishment request of the session with the adapter identified by the wireless communication apparatus ID received is received.

For that reason, it is necessary for the wireless communication apparatus to acquire the assigned session managing server information.",
        "A reference sign S1 of FIG. 5 corresponds to (1) of FIG. 2 ((1) of FIG. 28 as well). With referring to FIG. 5, the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 is provided with a table of wireless communication apparatus information 113 which stores wireless communication apparatus IDs, each of which is a unique number allocated to each wireless communication apparatus, and addresses for accessing assigned session managing servers, which manage the wireless communication apparatuses, making them correspond. As the wireless communication apparatus has a manufacturer's serial number unique to each wireless communication apparatus, the manufacturer's serial number is used as the ID of the wireless communication apparatus. The wireless communication apparatus makes the session managing server information acquisition request as shown in (1) of FIG. 2 ((1) of FIG. 28 as well) by using the manufacturer's serial number. The calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 sets the \u201cwireless communication apparatus ID\u201d to \u201c1-2-12\u201d in the session managing server information acquisition request when the power is turned on, and transmits it to the assignment notification server 410 as a GET method message. The assignment notification server 410 extracts the \u201cwireless communication apparatus ID \u201c1-2-12\u201d\u201d from the session managing server information acquisition request received, and searches a reference table of assigned session management 411 for it. In the reference table of assigned session management 411, the addresses of the session managing servers which manage the wireless communication apparatuses in a range specified by a wireless communication apparatus ID are stored. The assignment notification server 410 searches the range of the wireless communication apparatus ID in the reference table of assigned session managing server 411 based on the wireless communication apparatus ID \u201c1-2-12\u201d, and then acquires the address of the session managing server to which it is assigned. With this example, \u201cs1@xx.com\u201d (or a 32-bit global IP address such as 210.54.10.156) is acquired as the address of the session managing server. The assignment notification server 410 notifies the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 of the address acquired of the session managing server as a GET response message through (2) of FIG. 2 ((2) of FIG. 28 as well) and S2 of FIG. 5. The wireless communication apparatus registers the address of the assigned session managing server notified by making it correspond to the wireless communication apparatus ID \u201c1-2-12\u201d in a table of wireless communication apparatus information 113. The called party's wireless communication apparatus 120 also carried out the processing of (1) and (2) through S3 and S4 of FIG. 5 in the same manner as that of the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110.",
        "Reference numerals (3) and (4) of FIG. 2 denote the acquisition processing, which is performed by the calling party, of the session managing server information of the session managing server to which the called party's wireless communication apparatus is assigned. The calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 makes a called party's session managing server name request to the session managing server to which it is assigned (the calling party's session managing server 210). The calling party's session managing serer 210 transmits information about the session managing server to which the called party's wireless communication apparatus is assigned (the called party's session managing server 220) to the wireless communication apparatus as the inquiring source by sending a response message as a session managing server name response. According to the first embodiment, for processing load sharing of the session managing server, the wireless communication apparatus to be managed by the session managing server is specified for each wireless communication apparatus ID range, for example. For that reason, it is necessary for the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 to know the session managing server, which manages the called party's wireless communication apparatus when connecting a session with the called party's wireless communication apparatus 120.",
        "Reference signs S5, S6 and S7 of FIG. 6 correspond to the processing of (3) and (4) of FIG. 2. With referring to FIG. 6, when a called parity's telephone number is input through a telephone unit 10 (S5), the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 receives this telephone number, and acquires the called party's wireless communication apparatus ID corresponding to the called party's telephone number with referring to a table of address translation 114. The table of address translation 114 stores the called party's telephone (TEL) number, an IP address for accessing the called party's wireless communication apparatus, a wireless communication apparatus ID unique to the called party's wireless communication apparatus, and the address of the session managing server which manages the called party's wireless communication apparatus by making them correspond. The calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 includes the called party's wireless communication apparatus ID acquired in the called party's session managing server name, and transmits it as the GET method message to the session managing server (the calling party's session managing server 210) obtained through S2 (S6). The calling party's session managing server 210, upon reception of the called party's session managing server name request, acquires the address of the called party's session managing server to which the called party's wireless communication apparatus is assigned with referring to the reference table of called party's session managing server 213. The session managing server manages wireless communication apparatuses for each wireless communication apparatus ID range. For that reason, the reference table of called party's session managing server 213 stores the range of the called party's wireless communication apparatus ID and the address of the called party's session managing server by making them correspond. Since the called party's wireless communication apparatus ID is \u201c2-1-11\u201d, then \u201cs2@xx.com\u201d (or a 32-bit global IP address such as 210.54.10.156) is to be acquired as the called party's session managing server. The calling party's session managing server 210 includes \u201cs2@xx.com\u201d (or a 32-bit global IP address such as 210.54.10.156) as the address of the called party's session managing server acquired in the called party's session managing server name response, and notifies the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 of it as the GET message (S7). The calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 acquires \u201cs2@xx.com\u201d (or a 32-bit global IP address such as 210.54.10.156) as the address of the called party's session managing server from the called party's session managing server name response received, and then registers it by making it correspond to the \u201ccalled party's wireless communication apparatus ID \u201c2-1-11\u201d in the table of address conversion 114. FIG. 7 shows the called party's session managing server name acquisition processing.",
        "Reference numerals (5) and (6) of FIG. 2 denote processing of call message issuance (session ID acquisition). The call message is a message to be transmitted to the called party's session managing server 220 from the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110. The called party's session managing server 220 becomes aware, upon reception of the call message, that a call request has been issued to the called party's wireless communication apparatus 120 which it manages, judges the state of the intended party of the call (the called parity's wireless communication apparatus), at the same time obtains a call relay server available, and then responds with call relay server response information. According to the first embodiment, as shown in FIG. 29, the called party's wireless communication apparatus 120 makes a call arrival inquiry periodically (e.g., at intervals of one second or three seconds) to the session managing server assigned 220. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 30 or FIG. 31, the periodic inquiry may be replaced by the method of waiting until call arrival information is returned after the HTTP based GET is issued once. With this method, the processing load of the periodic inquiry may be saved. However, according to this method, an HTTP connection or a TCP connection has to be held for a long time even in a state where no data is transmitted or received. For this reason, in the actual internet environment, the TCP connection in a communication path from the wireless communication apparatus to the session managing server may be cut without prior notice by the router or the like which is managed by such as ISP. As a result, there is no guarantee of successful acquisition of the call arrival information. For an improvement of this method, in order to hold a continuous TCP connection of Keep-Alive information, FIG. 32 shows a method of continuously transmitting dummy data indicating that data is still being outputted to the wireless communication apparatus from the session managing server. On top of it, even if this method of continuously transmitting dummy data is employed, the TCP connection may possibly be cut somewhere on the communication path, and neither the session managing server nor the wireless communication apparatus may become aware of the disconnection. FIG. 33 shows an improvement method for that kind of situation. According to the method, the dummy data of the Keep-Alive information is to be transmitted to the wireless communication apparatus from the session managing server at a fixed cycle. In this situation, the receiving party's wireless communication apparatus sets up a timeout value having a period little longer than the period of the cycle. Then, in case of the dummy data not arriving at the wireless communication apparatus at the fixed cycle, it is considered that the TCP connection is disconnected, and then another TCP connection is made anew from the wireless communication apparatus to the session managing server. In addition, it is possible that the TCP reconnection and the transmission of the call arrival information to the wireless communication apparatus from the session managing server share the timing. In case of thus sharing the timing of the reconnection with the transmission, the call arrival information maybe lost before reaching the wireless communication apparatus. For that reason, the GET method of HTTP of a TCP reconnection, is added with information indicating that it is a reissue so that the call arrival information reaches the wireless communication apparatus without fail. This allows the session managing server to distinguish it from the GET method of HTTP, which is issued in a normal state. Then, the same call arrival information is to be transmitted again for fear of a transmission failure of the call arrival information. In addition, when this call arrival information maybe added with information indicating that it is a retransmission, then the wireless communication apparatus is allowed to become aware that the call arrival information received is of the retransmission. This provides the state where another new GET method of HTTP can be issued next in the normal state.",
        "In addition, the GET method of HTTP has been explained in the case where the called party's wireless communication apparatus receives the establishment request information of the session from the calling party's wireless communication apparatus as a response. However, the same mechanism as that explained above of receiving the response information of the GET method of HTTP without fail may also be applied to the case of receiving each information indicating that the receiver has been picked up at the other party's wireless communication apparatus (off-hook) (or a call start button has been pressed), the receiver has been hung up to end the telephone call (on-hook)(or a call end button has been pressed), ringing is started at the other party, as the response of this GET method of HTTP.",
        "As aforementioned, when the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 makes a call, it is required that the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 issues a call message to the session managing server 220 to which the called party's wireless communication apparatus 120 is assigned.",
        "The processing of call message issuance discussed above is based on (3) through (6) of FIG. 2, which may be replaced by a series of the operations of (3) through (8) of FIG. 28. The message flow of the calling party includes (4), (5), (6) and (7).",
        "With the called party, the called party's wireless communication apparatus 120 makes a periodic call arrival inquiry (e.g., at intervals of one second or three seconds) in advance to the assigned session managing server 220 to which it is assigned in the same manner as that of the case of FIG. 2 as shown in (3) of FIG. 28. Instead of making the periodic inquiry, however, the called party's wireless communication apparatus 120 may alternatively take the method of waiting until the call arrival information is returned after issuing the HTTP based GET message once.",
        "A reference numeral (4) of FIG. 28 is the processing of call message issuance (session ID acquisition). The call message is a message to be transmitted to the calling party's session managing server 210 from the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110. The calling party's session managing serer 210 obtains the information of the session managing server to which the called party's wireless communication apparatus is assigned (the called party's session managing server 220) in the same manner as that of the case of FIG. 2.

Then, the called party's session managing server 220 transmits a response message in the call relay server response information to the calling party's session managing server 210 in (6) of FIG. 28. Further, in (7) of FIG. 28, the response message is transferred to the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 from the calling party's session managing server 210.

The call message is issued by the issuance of the GET method message. The called party's session managing server 220 receives the issuance of the call message, and then registers the adapter ID of the called party's wireless communication apparatus with which the establishment of a session is requested, the requesting time, and the address of the calling party's session managing server to which the calling party's wireless communication apparatus transmitting the establishment request of the session is assigned in a table of session establishment request 223 of FIG. 9 by making them correspond. The table of session establishment request 223 of FIG. 9 is the table in which the adapter ID of the called party's wireless communication apparatus to which the call message request has been made, the requesting time at which the request was made, and the address of the calling party's session managing server to which the calling party's wireless communication apparatus is assigned are stored by making them correspond. The called party's session managing server 220, after storing them in the table, judges the state of the called party's wireless communication apparatus 120, and obtains a call relay server available. Then, the called party's session managing server 220 responds by information indicating the call relay server obtained in call relay server response information to the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 with FIG. 2, and to the calling party's session managing server 210 with FIG. 28. In the case where all the call relay servers to be used for relaying a call are engaged, then this fact is included in the call relay server response information and notified to the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 with FIG. 2, and the calling party's session managing server 210 with FIG. 28. A response to the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 or the calling party's session managing serve 210 is made by the GET response message.",
        "Reference numerals (7) and (8) of FIG. 2, or (3) and (8) of FIG. 28 denote the processing of inquiring about call arrival verification (session ID acquisition). This is the same as the processing of the called party's wireless communication apparatus and the called party's session managing server of FIG. 8 illustrating the call control methods. The called party's wireless communication apparatus 120 makes a call arrival message request to the called party's session managing server 220 ((7) of FIG. 2 or (3) of FIG. 28) only when it is in a call enable state. For that reason, with FIG. 2, the called party's session managing server 220 judges that the called party's wireless communication apparatus 120 is engaged if no call arrival message has been received from the called party's wireless communication apparatus 120.",
        "With the example of FIG. 2 above, the internet communication system has been discussed with the method in which the calling party's wireless communication apparatus issues a call to the called party's wireless communication apparatus via the session managing server. However, the above method is only one example. Now, the method of FIG. 28 is explained about the transmission and reception of a call control message to and from the session managing server.",
        "With the method of the example of FIG. 2, the message of the call arrival information is transmitted to the called party's session managing server from the called party's wireless communication apparatus only when it is in a call enable state. However, there is the case where the called party's wireless communication apparatus cannot transmit the message of the call arrival information due to some failure. In such a case, there is a possibility of falling into the situation that the abnormal state of the called party's wireless communication apparatus is not noticed at all, and the called party's wireless communication apparatus is left being engaged through. Furthermore, in order to implement a call waiting function, it is necessary to transmit call arrival information from another party's wireless communication apparatus even to the wireless communication apparatus, which is engaged. Therefore, in order to solve those problems, the wireless communication apparatus, no matter if being engaged or not, always transmits the message of the call arrival information to the session managing server so as to provide the session managing server with information notifying of the state of the called party's wireless communication apparatus. This method is considered desirable. With a call from another party's wireless communication apparatus, the information is transmitted to the called party's wireless communication apparatus from the session managing server, whereby the arrival of the call is verified. This is the same as that of the above-mentioned example of FIG. 2.",
        "Thus, the message of the call arrival information is to be continuously outputted to the session managing server. This allows the called party's wireless communication apparatus to be always aware of the presence of a calling from another party's wireless communication apparatus. In addition, the message of the call arrival information is continuously transmitted to the session managing server waiting for the arrival of the message of the call arrival information from the called party's wireless communication apparatus. Therefore, if it is not received, the session managing server may become aware of the abnormal state of the wireless communication apparatus, which may allow some recovery processing to be started.",
        "With the example of FIG. 28, the called party's session managing server 220 receives the call arrival message from the called party's wireless communication apparatus 120 while it is engaged even. The called party's session managing server 220 judges that the called party's wireless communication apparatus 120 is being engaged even if the session managing server is not involved in the call because the engaged state of the called party's adapter during a PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) based call, for example, is notified to the called party's session managing server 220 through some system from the called party's wireless communication apparatus itself.",
        "In addition, the called party's session managing server obtains a call relay server available, and responds to the called party's wireless communication apparatus 120 in the call relay server response information. In the case where all the call relay servers for call relaying are engaged, this fact is included in the call relay server response information so as to notify the called party's wireless communication apparatus 120 of it. The called party's session managing server 220 included in the call relay server response information a search result of the call request to the called party's wireless communication apparatus 120, and transmits it as a response message of call relay server ((8) of FIG. 2 or (8) of FIG. 28). The response message of call relay server is responded by the GET response message.",
        "According to the first embodiment, session managing servers manages wireless communication apparatuses from each other. In other words, the session managing servers assigned to the calling party's wireless communication apparatus and the called party's wireless communication apparatus are not necessarily the same. For that reason, the wireless communication apparatus knows the presence of a call from the intended party only by making a call arrival inquiry to the session managing server to which it is assigned directly with FIG. 2 and by way of the calling party's session managing server with FIG. 28.",
        "Reference signs S9, S10 and S11 of FIG. 10 correspond to the processing of (7) and (8) of FIG. 2 or the processing of (3) and (8) of FIG. 28.

The called party's wireless communication apparatus 120, issues the call arrival message request (S9) to the address of the called party's session managing server acquired. A call arrival message request is transmitted to the called party's session managing server 220 as the GET method message. The called party's session managing server 220 searches the table of session establishment request 223 based on the wireless communication apparatus ID of the wireless communication apparatus to which a call arrival message request is issued, and checks the presence of the session request. With the example of FIG. 10, there is a request having been issued to the address of the wireless communication apparatus ID \u201c2-1-11\u201d in the table of session establishment request 223. Consequently, the called party's session managing server 220 sets the presence of a session request in the call relay server response message, and notifies the called party's wireless communication apparatus 120 of it (S11). The call processing performed by the called party's wireless communication apparatus 120 and the called party's session managing server 220 of the call control method shown in FIG. 8 corresponds to the processing of S9 and S11. In addition, the called party's session managing server 220 acquires from the table of session establishment request 223 the address of the calling party's session managing server 210 of the establishment request of the session based on the call arrival message request.

        "An example of the operational configuration of a system using the internet communication system discussed in the first embodiment is discussed.",
        "FIG. 16 is a diagram illustrating an example of the operational configuration of an internet communication system according to a second embodiment. The figure shows a diagram illustrating the operational configuration of the internet communication system using a call control central management system.",
        "With referring to FIG. 16, several call relay servers are installed throughout the country, and grouped into the areas of western part of Japan and eastern part of Japan. Then, one unit of session managing server is arranged in the western part of Japan and one in the eastern part of Japan, and then a session managing server including an assignment notification server function is arranged in Tokyo. According to the internet communication system having the operational configuration shown in FIG. 16, voice data is transmitted and received between calling and called parties based on procedures illustrated in FIG. 17. The procedures of (1) to (10) of FIG. 17 are the same as those of (1) to (10) of FIG. 2. As alternative procedures to those of FIG. 17, (1) to (10) of FIG. 2 is also applicable. As shown in FIG. 16, the session managing server may be arranged in a predetermined area. This allows wireless communication apparatuses assigned to a session managing server so as to be managed according to the area. In the first embodiment, it was explained that the wireless communication apparatus is managed based on the wireless communication apparatus ID (manufacture's serial number). In the case of arranging the session managing servers as shown in FIG. 16, the wireless communication apparatus ID is formed with an \u201carea identifier\u201d and a \u201cwireless communication apparatus identifier\u201d. The assignment notification server, upon reception of the session managing server name request message from the wireless communication apparatus, determines the session managing server to which the wireless communication apparatus is assigned based on the \u201carea identifier\u201d. According to the case of FIG. 16, the session managing servers are arranged in the western part of Japan and the eastern part of Japan. For that reason, the \u201carea identifier\u201d may be used to determine the session managing server to which it is assigned. Furthermore, the area of the western part of Japan may be divided into segments such as Kyushu block, Kinki block, Sanin block and Shikoku block. Then, a session managing server may be arranged in each block. With this configuration, the \u201carea identifier\u201d may be hierarchized. Then, in the top layer of the hierarchy, an identifier for distinguishing between the western part of Japan and the eastern part of Japan may be arranged, and Kinki block, Sanyo block and Shikoku block may be arranged in a lower layer. This allows determining the session managing server to which a wireless communication apparatus is assigned. Still more, the Tokyo session managing server assignment notification server of FIG. 17 manages a West Japan session managing server and an East Japan session managing server. The West Japan session managing server manages Fukuoka call relay server and Osaka call relay server. The East Japan session managing server manages Sendai call relay server and Sapporo call relay server. In this manner, the call relay servers are managed by the session managing servers, which are arranged in nearby areas to the call relay servers according to the area of the call relay server arranged. This allows voice data to be relayed by the relay server, which is arranged in the nearest place to the area where the wireless communication apparatus is located.",
        "It is also possible as an alternative operational configuration, by tying up with two or more internet service providers (ISP), to install a session managing server and a call relay server in the places where the servers of the respective ISPs are installed, and connect the groups of servers (session managing servers and call relay servers) installed in the respective ISPs with each other over ISP networks. In this case, the wireless communication apparatus ID is formed by an \u201cISP identifier\u201d and a \u201cwireless communication apparatus identifier\u201d. The assignment notification server, upon reception of the session managing server name request message from a wireless communication apparatus, determines the session managing server to which the wireless communication apparatus is assigned based on the \u201cISP identifier\u201d. In addition, in the case where a single ISP manages one or more session managing servers, an \u201carea identifier\u201d is added to the wireless communication apparatus ID, so that the wireless communication apparatus ID is formed with the \u201cISP identifier\u201d, the \u201carea identifier\u201d and the \u201cwireless communication apparatus identifier\u201d. The session managing server to which the wireless communication apparatus is assigned is determined based on the \u201cISP identifier\u201d and the \u201carea identifier\u201d. Thus, the internet communication system may be managed by tying up with not only one ISP company but with two or more ISP companies. Still alternatively, it is also possible that a single ISP company handles a plurality of areas by the area identifiers and manages a plurality of session managing servers installed therein. FIG. 18 shows a diagram illustrating the configuration of a system in which the internet communication system is managed with two or more ISPs tied up.",
        "It is to be noted that the session managing servers or the call relay servers, which are managed by each ISP may communicate with each other through an ISP network owned by the ISP. In this case, communications through the ISP network between session managing servers, between call relay servers, or between a session managing server and a call relay server, are to be carried out by using UDP. Alternatively, RTP (Transport Protocol for Real-time Application) or TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is to be used for carrying out communications. It is beyond question that a similar protocol in another transport layer may alternatively be employed. By thus enabling communications between different ISPs, voice data may be transmitted and received between calling and called parties through call relay servers managed by different ISPs. The wireless communication apparatus and the call relay server communicate with each other over the internet by using HTTP in the same manner as that discussed in the first embodiment. FIG. 19 and FIG. 20 each show an operational configuration of the internet communication system, which uses an ISP network. FIG. 19 illustrates that call relay servers and a session managing server are connected respectively with an ISP network. FIG. 20 illustrates an example of transmitting voice data between call relay servers over an ISP network. In the case of transmitting voice data between call relay servers over the ISP network by using predetermined two units out of the call relay servers shown in FIG. 19, a simple voice data transfer is applied to communication between the call relay servers, and \u201cPOST (in the case of transmitting data from a wireless communication apparatus to a call relay server)\u201d and \u201cGET (in the case of transmitting data to a wireless communication apparatus from a call relay server)\u201d are applied to communication between the wireless communication apparatus and the call relay server of the calling party, and between the wireless communication apparatus and the call relay server of the called party, as shown in FIG. 20. This has been already discussed in the first embodiment.",
        "In addition, as an example of the ISP network, a CATV network owned by an internet connection service provided by a CATV (cable television) company may be used to manage the internet communication system. FIG. 21 and FIG. 22 show operational examples of the internet communication system using CATV networks. FIG. 21 illustrates that a nearby call relay server having a wide band connection for a CATV company area is assigned to the CATV area. According to the example of FIG. 21, Tokyo session managing server, in the case where an internet telephone is used between Hanshin CATV and Ichihara CATV, designates Osaka call relay server to be used on the Hanshin CATV side and Tokyo call relay server to be used on the Ishihara CATV side. Between Tokyo call relay server and Osaka call relay server, UDP is used for transmitting voice data. FIG. 22 illustrates an example of managing the system by installing servers (a session managing server, a call relay server and an assignment notification server) grouped in one place, and connecting the place having the group of servers to a CATV network. In the current state of communication network arrangement, as shown in FIG. 22, broadest band communication networks are concentrated in Tokyo (Otemachi), in which, therefore, an assignment notification server, a session managing server, and a call relay server are installed. In addition, in many cases, communications are carried out between CATV networks via Tokyo (Otemachi). For that reason, by installing the servers grouped in Tokyo (Otemachi), band may be secured.",
        "That explains the format of the wireless communication apparatus ID and the management examples of the internet communication system.",
        "In a third embodiment, a description is given of processes performed by a session managing server.",
        "The session managing servers discussed in the first and second embodiments each perform the \u201cassignment of a call relay server available\u201d and the \u201cmanagement of session IDs\u201d for load sharing and management of call relaying of a call relay server for relaying data between calling and called parties.",
        "There are three processes performed by the session managing server.",
        "One is \u201ccall arrival management process\u201d for receiving an inquiry of confirmation for call arrival, which is made in a cycle by a wireless communication apparatus to a session managing server to which the wireless communication apparatus is assigned.",
        "A second one is \u201ccalled party's assigned session managing server search process\u201d for receiving an inquiry for the session managing server to which the called party is assigned at the session managing server to which the self (calling party's wireless communication apparatus) is assigned when making a call. In the called party's assigned session managing server search process, a corresponding session managing server is searched for in response to the inquiry from the wireless communication apparatus, and a response is made with information indicating a session managing server searched out with FIG. 2. With FIG. 28, on the other hand, a call message is transmitted directly to the session managing server searched out, and a response message from the called party's session managing server is received.",
        "A third one is \u201ccall management process\u201d for receiving a call request at the session managing server to which the called party is assigned at the start of communication.",
        "The internet communication system according to this embodiment has a plurality of session managing servers installed. Each session managing server deals with requests and inquiries from the wireless communication apparatuses assigned to the session managing server itself, so that the load of each session managing server is shared. FIG. 23 illustrates an environment, which corresponds to the case of FIG. 2, of the session managing server in which the three processes discussed above are executed. FIG. 35 illustrates an environment, which corresponds to the case of FIG. 28, of the session managing server in which the three processes discussed above are executed. With referring to FIG. 23 and FIG. 35, the session managing server carries out the processes by using the \u201cassigned session managing server data file\u201d, the \u201carea managing data\u201d, the \u201crelay server managing data\u201d and the \u201csession managing data\u201d.",
        "The \u201cassigned session managing server data file\u201d, the \u201carea managing data\u201d, the \u201crelay server managing data\u201d and the \u201csession managing data\u201d of FIG. 23 are detailed below. The same applies to those of FIG. 35.",
        "The \u201cassigned session managing server data file\u201d includes items shown in FIG. 24, and is provided for every session managing server. With reference to FIG. 24, \u201cstatus\u201d, \u201cISP identifier\u201d, \u201carea identifier\u201d and \u201cassigned session managing server IP address\u201d are included. The \u201cISP identifier\u201d is required when a session managing server is managed by two or more ISPs. This assigned session managing server data file is searched so as to determine a session managing server to which the called party's wireless communication apparatus is assigned. Alternatively, the assignment notification server may be provided with the assigned session managing server file, which allows the assignment notification server to reply to the session managing server name request message from the calling party's wireless communication apparatus.",
        "The following details the \u201care managing data\u201d.",
        "The \u201carea managing data\u201d stores the management information of the call relay server, which is managed by the session managing server. FIG. 25 shows an example of the data structure of the area managing data. The session managing server determines candidates for a call relay server for relaying a call based on this area managing data, confirms the state of each call relay server candidate determined, and selects an acting server for relaying the call.",
        "The following details the relay server managing data.",
        "FIG. 26 shows a relation between the area managing data and the relay server managing data and a relation between the relay server managing data and the session managing data. The relay server managing data links to the call relay server management information of the area managing data. The relay server managing data links to a start address and an end address of the relay server managing data and stores call relay server managing data 510 in the case where the area managing data has the structure of area managing data 500 in FIG. 26. Each piece of call relay server managing data has information including \u201ccall relay server use status\u201d through \u201csession managing data end address\u201d in data 520.",
        "The session managing data stores session managing data 530 in FIG. 26. The session managing data 530 has information including the \u201csession state\u201d through the \u201ccall relay IP address (called party)\u201d of data 540. The session managing data 530 links to the \u201csession managing data start address\u201d and the \u201csession managing data end address\u201d of the call relay server managing data 520.",
        "The session managing server manages the state of the call relay server based on data shown in FIG. 25 and FIG. 26, and searches for a call relay server available and determines it upon reception of a call request made by a wireless communication apparatus.",
        "That explains the function of the session managing server and data stored therein.",
        "In the first through third embodiments, the internet communication system was discussed in the cases where voice data is transmitted and received between calling and called parities. It is to be noted that the voice data is an example of communication data and that the internet communication system is a system for transmitting and receiving communication data between calling and called parties. Furthermore, the mobile phone is an example of wireless communication apparatus, and the call relay server is an example of communication relay server.",
        "In addition, the \u201cID\u201d may be any one of such as a name, identification information, an identifier or an IP address as long as it can discriminate itself from others.",
        "In addition, it is to be noted that the system components (the calling party's wireless communication apparatus unit 111, 121, the called party's wireless communication apparatus unit 112, 122, the calling party's session managing unit 211, 221, the called party's session managing unit 212, 222, the HTTP communication unit 311, 321, and the UDP communication unit 312, 322 of FIG. 1) are executed by software, hardware or a combination of software and hardware.",
        "In addition, it is to be noted that the system components (the calling party's wireless communication apparatus unit 111, 121, the called party's wireless communication apparatus unit 112, 122, the calling party's session managing unit 211, 221, the called party's session managing unit 212, 222, the HTTP communication unit 311, 321, and the UDP communication unit 312, 322 of FIG. 1) are executed by the process of the program which is executed on a computer.",
        "In addition, it is to be noted that the wireless communication apparatus, the session managing server, the assignment notification server and the communication relay server are all computers. Furthermore, the program is executed by the CPU (central processing unit) of a computer.",
        "In addition, it is to be noted that the program is stored in a storage medium such as a FXD (flexible disk) or ROM (read only memory).",
        "A wireless communication apparatus such as that shown in FIG. 27 explained in the conventional example allows a call to be made through a public line other than through an IP line. This case, however, requires exclusive access control in order to avoid parallel processing with a public line based call if the call is to be processed through the IP line as discussed in the first through fourth embodiments of the present invention.",
        "Accordingly, it is designed that a wireless communication apparatus, in the case of making a call through a public line, notifies the session managing server which manages the wireless communication apparatus and also manages call control on the IP (Internet Protocol) line of information about the start and the end of the public line based call at the start and the end of the call, as indicated by (3) in FIG. 36.",
        "In addition, a wireless communication apparatus may be provided with a function for allowing a call not only through a public line but also through other IP line based systems such as H.323 system (terminal rules for voice, video and data communications on the LAN whose service quality is not guaranteed), MGCP (Medical Gateway Control Protocol) system, and SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) system. In this case, exclusive access control is to be performed of call processing based on those communication systems. Accordingly, it is designed that a wireless communication apparatus notifies the session managing server which manages the wireless communication apparatus of information about the start and the end of an IP line based call through such a system as those indicating that the call is being made through the different system at the start and the end of the call through the different system, as indicated by (2) in FIG. 36.",
        "In addition, as indicated by (1) in FIG. 36, the wireless communication apparatuses, which communicate with each other may transmit and receive each other's information about the telephone operations via the session managing server. In this case, if one of the telephones is in a calling state, the other may be controlled to make a ring back tone sound. If the other party picked up the receiver, the call may be started. If the line is cut by the receiver placed on the hook, disconnection noise may be made through the receiver of the other party. FIG. 37 illustrates an example of communication processing of a communication using the GET method of HTTP via the session managing server.",
        "\u201cReceiver off hook\u201d (or, pressing call-start ON button, for example), \u201cdial input\u201d, \u201cring back tone start\u201d and \u201cother side disconnection noise\u201d on the left hand side of FIG. 37 and \u201cring start\u201d, \u201creceiver off hook\u201d (or, pressing call-start ON button, for example) and \u201creceiver on hook\u201d (or, pressing call-end ON button, for example) on the right hand side thereof are telephone operations performed by a telephone as one example of wireless communication apparatus. A call control message sequence using the GET method of HTTP is indicated by the lines with arrows.",
        "As shown in FIG. 37, the calling party's wireless communication apparatus and the called party's wireless communication apparatus each issue a GET method notifying the session managing server of the detail of the receiver operations when performing the operation of the \u201creceiver off hook\u201d, \u201cdial input\u201d or \u201creceiver on hook\u201d by a telephone as one example of wireless communication apparatus. Then, the session managing server, upon notification that the calling party's wireless communication apparatus performed the operation of \u201cdial input\u201d, transmits a call GET response for performing the operation of \u201cring back tone start\u201d back to the calling party's wireless communication apparatus until it receives an off hook report from the called party's session managing server. When the receiver off hook is notified to the called party's session managing server from the called party's wireless communication apparatus, an off hook report is notified to the calling party's session managing server from the called party's session managing server. Then, an arrival get response is sent to the calling party's wireless communication apparatus from the calling party's session managing server. After that, voice call is carried out between the calling party's wireless communication apparatus and the called party's wireless communication apparatus. When the voice call ends, and the called party's wireless communication apparatus performs the operation of \u201creceiver on hook\u201d, then an on hook report is notified to the calling party's session managing server from the called party's session managing server. Then, the calling party's session managing server notifies the calling party's wireless communication apparatus of the arrival GET response, and the calling party's wireless communication apparatus makes it transmit a disconnection noise informing that the other party's receiver is placed on the hook or on hook, through the telephone.",
        "As aforementioned, the session managing server is allowed to collect information about the start and the end of a call by a different call control system and the telephone operations through notification from the wireless communication apparatus. For that reason, if those pieces of information are outputted and stored as log information when transmitted and received, information about various types of call use used by the user may be collected. As a result, the duration of a call may be confirmed, which may be used as service charge information.",
        "In addition, software for analyzing and arranging this call relating log information may be implemented in such as the session managing server. This may allow the system administrator to refer to call history information by day and by month, as shown in FIG. 38, and check the operating state of the system. FIG. 38 shows an example of tabular display of a day-based summary and a month-based summary. The system administrator is allowed to create a table shown in FIG. 38 (or a corresponding file in such as a CSV (abbreviation of Comma Separated Value) form) based on the respective call information files obtained through a software tool for analyzing the log information of the session managing server, display it through such as the Web browser, and refer to it. The total number of calls and a maximum number of instantaneous and simultaneous calls may alternatively be displayed by graphical representation.",
        "If every wireless communication apparatus is allocated a fixed global IP address, it is basically possible to transmit and receive various types of information directly by using any protocols. However, with Ipv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4), most wireless communication apparatuses are connected indirectly to the Internet. Therefore, in many cases, the wireless communication apparatuses are allocated private IP addresses through address translation from the routers having fixed global IP addresses allocated. With those routers, the firewall function for such as blocking access to port numbers not used is set up in many cases together with an address translation function such as NAT (Network Address Translation) and IP Masquerade (Internet Protocol Masquerade).",
        "Furthermore, with an internet line available for ordinary household, a global IP address or a private IP address within a domain is allocated to each household in most cases. For that reason, in many cases, two or more personal computers are connected to the Internet at home by way of a SOHO (Small Office Home Office) router, which is designed for home or small sized office use. Also with this SOHO router, address translation is performed, and the firewall function is installed in many cases.",
        "As aforementioned, the general application level communication protocols which may allow the wireless communication apparatus whose address translation may be performed twice or more into a private IP address as a result of passing through two or more routers to access an external wireless communication apparatus, includes HTTP and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).",
        "In addition, in the current situation where Ipv4 is popular, an IP address, whether it is a global IP address or a private IP address, is allocated dynamically in very many cases. For allocating an IP address thus dynamically, it is designed that the assignment notification server is provided with a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server function and each wireless communication apparatus is provided with a DHCP customer function.",
        "For that reason, it is substantially impossible in many cases for a wireless communication apparatus to employ an IP address as addressing for specifying a destination.",
        "Having mentioned previously, a wireless communication apparatus within each domain which is under area management by such as a firewall and a NAT router (referred to in many cases as a SOHO router or a broadband router) communicates with a wireless communication apparatus outside the domain or various types of servers in external domains by way of the session managing server and the call relay server installed in the DMZ (De-Militarized Zone) of that domain.",
        "FIG. 39 shows types of call relay systems, namely system 1 to system 3, for real-time data communications between a wireless communication apparatus and a call relay server.",
        "With referring to the types of call relay systems of FIG. 39, \u201cSystem 1\u201d represents the type in which the call relay server is not used, \u201cSystem 2\u201d represents the type in which a single call relay server is used by one of the calling party and the called party, and \u201cSystem 3\u201d represents the type in which two call relay servers are used by the calling and called parties, respectively.",
        "With System 1, the calling party's wireless communication apparatus and the called party's wireless communication apparatus communicate with each other by using UDP. This is called Type \u201cU Direct\u201d.",
        "With System 2, the calling party's wireless communication apparatus and the call relay server communicate with each other by using HTTP or UDP. Then, the called party's wireless communication apparatus and the call relay server communicate with each other by using HTTP or UDP. The call relay server may be used by the called party, the call relay server and the called party's wireless communication apparatus may communicate with each other by using HTTP, and the calling party's wireless communication apparatus and the called party's call relay server may communicate with each other by using UDP. This is called Type \u201c-UH\u201d. The call relay server may be used by the calling party, the calling party's wireless communication apparatus and the call relay server may communicate with each other by using HTTP, and the calling party's call relay server and the called party's wireless communication apparatus may communicate with each other by using UDP. This is called Type \u201cHU-\u201d. Furthermore, the call relay server may be used by the calling party, the calling party's wireless communication apparatus and the calling party's call relay server may communicate with each other by using UDP, and the calling party's call relay server and the called party's wireless communication apparatus may communicate with each other by using UDP. This is called Type \u201cUU-\u201d. Still further, the call relay server may be used by the called party, the called party's call relay server and the called party's wireless communication apparatus may communicate with each other by using UDP, and the calling party's wireless communication apparatus and the called party's call relay server may communicate with each other by using UDP. This is called Type \u201c-UU\u201d.",
        "Then, with System 3, the calling party's wireless communication apparatus and the calling party's call relay server communicate with each other by using HTTP or UDP, the calling party's call relay server and the called party's call relay server communicate with each other by using UDP, and the called party's call relay server and the called party's wireless communication apparatus communicate with each other by using HTTP or UDP. The calling party's wireless communication apparatus and the calling party's call relay server may communicate with each other by using HTTP, and the called party's call relay server and the called party's wireless communication apparatus may communicate with each other by using HTTP.

        "A method of judging used or unused about the call relay server in a call between wireless communication apparatuses is discussed below.",

        "As aforementioned, in the current situation where there are various types of network address environment, any communications may be carried out by using HTTP as a basis. However, it is desirable to use UDP such as RTP wherever possible in real-time communication.",
        "For example, the following shows the cases in which UDP is applicable.\n\n    Every wireless communication apparatus is allocated a global IP address (fixed, DHCP).\n    Every wireless communication apparatus is allocated a private IP address (fixed, DHCP) inside the same domain.\n    Firewall may be set up such that a desirable UDP port is accessible.",
        "In various cases such as those mentioned above, the type of the connection terminal of the wireless communication apparatus may be prescribed so that UDP can be used as much as possible, and information about the type may be exchanged with each other between the wireless communication apparatuses while call control is, being set up.

However, it is possible that (static) NAT setup is made for a NAT router so that the NAT router transmits and receives voice data using UDP via a UDP port directly to and from the wireless communication apparatus. In other words, it is allowed to transmit and receive voice data by using UDP between the communication relay server and the NAT router. For that reason, it is desirable that the wireless communication apparatus should just set up a terminal connection type not of A or P but of B, C, D, E, Q or R corresponding to the location of the NAT router. This allows UDP based voice data transmission and reception even in the case where the wireless communication apparatus is connected immediately under the NAT router. As a result, the call quality is enhanced.",

        "As shown in FIG. 54, when the wireless communication apparatus is connected to the Internet and the power is turned ON, it transmits an alive report message (manufacture's serial number, IP address, information of confirmation for normal operation) to the remote control maintenance server in a fixed cycle (e.g., once per day).",
        "The remote control maintenance server confirms a new item in the alive report message, and registers it in a customer management database. The remote control maintenance server then checks the alive report together with registered items whether they are of normal or not. The contents of this alive report may include the addition that the hardware of the wireless communication apparatus is partially damaged. Once such an abnormal state is identified, the administrator who manages the assignment notification server may report the user of the abnormal state of the wireless communication apparatus and start a procedure for replacing it with a substitute and the like.",
        "As an alive report message, information about whether the assignment notification server or the like is operating normally or not may be sent back as a response message in the case of using the GET method of HTTP. In this case, by notifying the wireless communication apparatus side of the abnormal condition of such as the assignment notification server or the session managing server, an error message may be displayed on the display unit of the wireless communication apparatus. Alternatively, the user may be notified of the condition by hearing through the receiver (one example of voice output unit) with such a message as \u201cDue to a failure on the server side, you will be put through via the public line\u201d.",
        "On the other hand, with referring to the assignment notification server and the session managing server, it is possible to have a redundant system provided in case that the hardware breaks down. In this case, assuming that primarily used assignment notification server and session managing server are called primary servers, ones, which may be used as backups are set up as secondary servers. In addition, when each server's IP address is notified to the assignment notification server as the response message to the alive report response message, it may be sent to both the primary one and the secondary one. Alternatively, the redundant system is not limited to the primary and the secondary, but may have three or more servers. FIG. 55 and FIG. 56 show how the secondary server is replaced for the primary server when it breaks down.",
        "In addition, according to this embodiment, it is assumed that the internet telephone network system is used for accounting. For this accounting operation, as shown in FIG. 54, a customer management database 710 is provided. This customer management database 710 manages the payment of service charges. Then, in the case of default in payment being confirmed, when the assignment notification server receives the alive report message, the customer management database 10 disenables reception in an HTTP relay on the session managing server side, or disenables the operation of the wireless communication apparatus directly by the response message to the alive report message. Subsequently, if a customer paid the charge, and a paid-up registration has been made in the customer management database, then the setting of disenabled use is canceled when the alive report message is transmitted again to the assuagement notification server.",
        "In addition, the alive report message to the assignment notification server is used for another purpose, that is, the software version management of the wireless communication apparatus. When the software of the wireless communication apparatus needs upgrading, the download version upgrading process of software upgrading module server 810 is started from the assignment notification server based on a customer management database 710 through remote control. Or, a version upgrading command is inputted through the telephone by the customer so that it is downloaded to the wireless communication apparatus. It is to be noted that, in the former case, since the software upgrading of the wireless communication apparatus is made purely depend on the administrator's convenience, the user is not allowed to use it during the upgrading in process. For that reason, while the user is engaged in a call, the software upgrading is to be delayed until the calling process ends. In addition, the wireless communication apparatus may be provided with the user interface, which allows the operation below. Before performing the upgrading, the user may be reported by means of a display device or a speaker device of the start of upgrading. If the user is not willing to have the upgrading for reasons of his/her own, then the process of upgrading is stopped.",
        "Thus, the system administrator is allowed to perform downloading through remote control for a wireless communication apparatus owned by the user by way of the assignment notification server. Also, it is possible by using the same mechanism that a self-diagnostic program is executed on the wireless communication apparatus, and resultant information is transmitted to the assignment notification server side. Similarly, it is also possible that an optional self-diagnostic program for acquiring more detailed information based on the resultant information is executed through remote control, and that fault information is sent to the user.",

        "The assignment notification server 410 is configured with a plurality of server devices including a primary server and a secondary server. The primary server is designed to act as the assignment notification server, but if the operation of the primary server gets abnormal, then the secondary server is switched over so as to operate as the assignment notification server. Subsequently, the assignment notification server 410 notifies the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 that the secondary server is now acting as the assignment notification server.",
        "Furthermore, the internet communication system according to this embodiment is thus equipped with the client management database 710. The client management database 710 manages system service charge for each wireless communication apparatus of calling party.",
        "Thus, as aforementioned, the assignment notification server 410, upon transmission of the server ID of the session managing server 210 that manages the wireless communication apparatus 110 to the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110, receives from the client management database a service charge statement for the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110, and transmits the service charge statement received and the server ID to the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110.",
        "The calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 determines whether to render its own communication facility in operable or not based on the communication charge statement received from the assignment notification server 410.",
        "The calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 whose communication facility is thus inoperable determines whether to render it operable or not based on the service charge statement received from the assignment notification server 410.",
        "Still more, as aforementioned, the calling party's communication apparatus 110 includes built-in software for executing the wireless communication apparatus facility, the software carrying its version information.

        "The assignment notification server 410 manages the address of a Web server that manages the built-in software in the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110. Then, the assignment notification server 410 transmits the address of a Web server dealing with the different version software to the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 in the case where the assignment notification server 410 determined to switch the built-in software in the calling party's wireless communication apparatus 110 over to the different version software.",
        "The wireless communication apparatus is not substantially allowed to make a phone call by way of the IP line if it is not allowed to communicate with the session managing server or the call relay server, which manage call control. In light of the above, according to the call control of this embodiment, it is designed that when an IP line based call is not allowed, the user is informed accordingly by way of a wireless communication apparatus. Artificial voice may be used as one of the methods to inform through the receiver (one example of voice output unit) of a telephone that an IP line based call is not available. Artificial voice may be produced by the method in which a human voice message is recorded in advance, and its digitized information is stored in a server or a memory in a wireless communication apparatus and then reproduced. As another method, voice sound may be artificially synthesized from the text data of a message and then produced. Alternatively, it is also possible to use the display unit of a wireless communication apparatus to inform of it similarly. In addition, this wireless communication apparatus may also be provided with a public line based call function in addition to the IP line based call function so that in case that an IP line based call is not allowed, a public line based call may automatically be started.",
        "As shown in FIG. 57, the session managing server constantly counts the number of call sessions of the call relay server, which it manages. For that reason, the session managing server is allowed to confirm that the call relay server has performed the process of call relaying up to the limit of its call capacity for relay ((1) in FIG. 57). In that situation, the call relay server cannot afford of relaying a call any more by way of the IP line. Consequently, it may be designed that the disenabled IP line based call is notified to the user, or the call is switched to a public line based call ((2) in FIG.57) as aforementioned.",
        "A warning message to be sent to the user about such as an abnormal state of the wireless communication apparatus is summarized below.\n\n    (1) Such as an abnormal state is informed by means of such as Light Emitting Diode, a liquid crystal display, and buzzer.\n    (2) During a call, a message of such as warning is reproduced through the receiver.

Now, I will put you through.",
        "According to the system of this embodiment, the wireless communication apparatus communicates with the session managing server or the call relay server, which manages call control by using HTTP. For that reason, TCP based communication is executed at the start of communication as shown in FIG. 58. The wireless communication apparatus 110 executes a TCP connection to each server by using a socket function called \u201cconnect\u201d in the first place for an HTTP communication from a client to a server. A timeout value is set up for connect function call waiting time. When the waiting time exceeds the timeout value, the current execution of the connect function is terminated there, and the execution of the connect function is restarted. In addition, an upper limit value is set up also for the number of reexecuting times of the connect function. This is designed for avoiding an infinite execution. In the case where the number of reexecuting times of the connect function exceeds the upper limit value, error processing is to be carried out. FIG. 59 shows how HTTP messages are transmitted and received by the TCP socket function. FIG. 59 illustrates a relation between HTTP data transmission and reception and socket function call.",
        "Initial processing of the connection for TCP communication is started with the wireless communication apparatus calling the connect function as a client (\u201c(1) TCP connection request\u201d in FIG. 59). In this situation, if the blocking mode (the \u201cblocking mode\u201d means that the client side is to wait to proceed to execute further processing until it receives a response from the server side) of the connect function is used, the connect function is not terminated until the TCP connection is established (\u201c(2) TCP connection acceptance\u201d in FIG. 59), so that the execution of a program is blocked and suspended. There is no problem if the TCP connection is established in a shorter period of time. However, it may take a very long period of time to establish this TCP connection due to some causes such as a network related cause. In such a case, the TCP connection may be established soon in many cases if the execution of the connect function is led to forced termination once and then reexecuted anew. For that reason, a timeout value may be set up for the execution of the connect function. Then, when the timeout value is exceeded, the execution of the connect function may be stopped or led to forced termination, and then reexecuted a new. This assures a successful TCP connection without the processing being kept waiting for a long period of time. This reexecution is not necessarily limited to only once. If the waiting time still exceeds the timeout value even after reexecution, reexecution may be repeated. This may enhance efficiency in restoration in case of a failure. On the other hand, it is meaningless to repeat execution infinitely. For that reason, a fixed maximum value may be set up for the times of reexecution. Then, the TCP connection is repeated until the maximum value. Then, in the case of the times of reconnection exceeding the maximum value, it is considered that some failure has occurred with the network, etc., and error processing should be carried out.",
        "In addition, a fixed constant is given to the timeout value for starting the TCP connection or the maximum value for the times of reexecution at the time of starting the wireless communication apparatus. Then, with a higher success rate of starting the TCP connection in a short period of time, the timeout value is made shorter, and the times of reconnections are reduced. As a result, in case that an error occurs, the occurrence of error may be recognized in a short time. On the other hand, if the success rate is lower, then it is desirable that the timeout value is made longer, and the times is increased in order to secure the TCP connection. Thus, it is allowed to implement the function of automatically adjusting the timeout value or the number of times for reexecutions to an optimal value, while an actual period of time before starting the TCP connection or an actual number of times for reexecution is measured. This allows manual labor to be saved for adjusting the timeout value or the number of repeating times to the optimal setting.",
        "In call processing of voice data to be transmitted and received over the Internet, the call quality depends largely on data traffic congestion in an actual path on the internet. Then, the delay time of data at arrival is constantly watched in a specific call route, and it is examined whether or not the delay is in the level of affecting the call quality. In addition, if it is confirmed that there is no doubt about that the delay, which would affect the call quality, has occurred, the user may be informed that the call quality has been degraded by means of such as a display unit of the wireless communication apparatus.",
        "The session managing servers installed throughout the nation store the IP addresses of the respective session managing servers as database. It is possible to measure general communication delay time regularly between specific session managing servers (a call relay server is assumed to be in almost the same position as that of this session managing server) by an OS command called ping of Windows OS (\u201cWindows\u201d is the operating system of Microsoft Corp) or an OS command called tracert of Unix OS (\u201cUnix\u201d is the name of an operating system developed by AT&T Bell Laboratories). Alternatively, the communication delay time may be measured by actually transmitting and receiving a voice packet based on UDP, HTTP, or the like to be used in the IP telephone network system of this invention separately, and creating software for measuring the delay time. Accordingly, a direct route delay between the session managing servers at the two points to which the adapters of calling and called parties are assigned, respectively, may be obtained by means of the OS command or the software. In addition, bypass route delay caused through a third session managing server may also be obtained. As a result, if the time of bypass route delay sum is shorter than the time of the route delay between the session managing servers at the two points, then the setup of the voice data relay route may be changed such that the bypass route is selected and the call relay server route includes the call relay server at the third point.",
        "FIG. 60 is a diagram illustrating the processing of confirming for congestion based on an internet route delay check.",
        "With reference to FIG. 60, a check result, a total delay between Tokyo and Osaka is 100 msec, a total delay between Tokyo and Chiba is 800 msec, and a total delay between Tokyo and Chiba is 200 msec. Consequently, the total of delay between Tokyo and Osaka and delay between Tokyo and Chiba is shorter than a total delay between Osaka and Chiba. For that reason, the communication path of the Tokyo-Osaka route is replaced by the Tokyo-Osaka route and the Tokyo-Chiba route. As for the selection of this third relay point, if the number of session managing servers arranged throughout the country is large, the optimum may be selected by calculating the sum of delay time and comparing them. As a result, a more comfortable condition may be secured for communication. As a matter of course, since many communication paths coexist, those communication paths may be controlled, wherever possible, so that they are appropriately decentralized without concentrating in one place.",
        "Note that software may be implemented to display a diagram illustrating a network traffic condition between the respective session managing servers and call relay servers as shown in FIG. 60. This allows the system administrator to visually check network congestion. As a result, the system administrator is allowed to directly instruct the session managing server to select the call relay server at the third relay point so that a less congested network route is allocated to the voice data transmission and reception path. This allows an effective operation in an emergency when automatic server processing is not enough time-wise.",
        "In FIG. 60, a total delay is indicated by text near its communication path like \u201cTotal Delay 800 msec between Osaka-Chiba\u201d, for example. Alternatively, however, a communication route may be discriminated from others by color or blinking according to delay speed.",
        "The administrator is requested to review, redesign and reconstruct the IP telephone network system, which has been provided, if calling failures occur frequently. For this reason, a warning function to the administrator is important.

An automatic restoration is performed for a failure, and the condition is notified to the administrator by means of such as automatic message transmission or log output.\n    (2) In trying to make an IP telephone call, an access to a server is failed by timeout in many times, and there is no other way than calling through the public line more than a fixed number of times.

In this case, a warning is sent to the administrator by means of such as automatic message transmission or log output.\n    (4) For making an IP telephone call, the normal voice data transmission and reception path of the call relay server is rarely available, so that the call route had to be changed frequently, and the number of the changes exceeds a fixed value. In this case, a warning is sent to the administrator by means of such as automatic message transmission or log output.",

In this case, an extension number system which is available only within a specific area may be set up for telephone calls within the area, unlike outside lines, in many cases. Therefore, it would be convenient if those extension numbers can be managed collectively with a conversion table for translating the extension numbers into the IP addresses and identifiers of the wireless communication apparatuses of the present invention as a database. For that reason, as shown in FIG. 61, this translation table may be set up in the session managing server (extension number database 720). In this case, when an extension number is inputted from a wireless communication apparatus, the wireless communication apparatus transmits extension number information to the session managing server. On the session managing server, the wireless communication apparatus of the call partner is specified. Then, call control is performed with the specified wireless communication apparatus of the other party through the procedures of (1) to (6) shown in FIG. 62.",
        "A procedure of an extension telephone call control system is discussed with reference to FIG. 62.",
        "The calling party's wireless communication apparatus, upon reception of an extension number, transmits a call message together with the telephone number received to the session managing server (2). The session managing server specifies a communication partner based on the transmitted extension number with reference to the extension number database 720 (3). The session managing server, if a call arrival message acquisition is performed by the called party's wireless communication apparatus (1), sends a call arrival message back to the called party's wireless communication apparatus. In addition, the session managing server also responds to the call message to the calling party's wireless communication apparatus (5). After (4) and (5), the calling party and the called party make a call with each other in the same manner as that of the call processing performed between wireless communication apparatuses in the normal UDP direct communication (6). In case of failing to specify the wireless communication apparatus of the other party even by searching the extension number database 720 in the session managing server, the search failure is reported to the calling party (3). The calling party's wireless communication apparatus sends the user a message such as \u201cThe dialed number is not used.\u201d and \u201cNumber management system is currently out of order.\u201d",
        "As an implementation type for actually implementing a call control system using an extension number, there are some examples each for a case with PBX 130 (FIG. 64, FIG. 65) and a case without PBX (FIG. 63).",
        "According to the implementation type without PBX shown in FIG. 63, a type internal U Direct (Type \u201cU Direct\u201d indicates a message transmission and reception process using UDP, which uses no call relay server, of system 1 discussed with reference to FIG. 39 in the sixth embodiment) is applied to extension calls within a base. Then, a point-to-point call UUU is applied there to between bases (\u201cUUU\u201d indicates a message transmission and reception process performed between a wireless communication apparatus and a call relay server and between call relay servers by using UDP according to the system 3 using two call relay servers discussed with reference to FIG. 39 in the sixth embodiment in which). The extension number is determined as follows. Since it is connected directly to a public line network, a point-to-point call is transmitted by using a prefix \u201c7\u201d like \u201c7-area number-extension number\u201d. The session managing server transmits telephone number information, \u201carea number-extension number\u201d, after removing the prefix from it.",
        "Now, the implementation type with PBX is discussed.",
        "FIG. 64 shows the type in which a wireless communication apparatus is installed on the PBX extension side.",
        "In the case of FIG. 64, PBX extension is used within a base, but the point-to-point call \u201cUUU\u201d is used between bases (\u201cUUU\u201d corresponds to Type \u201cUUU\u201d of System 3 discussed with reference to FIG. 39 in the sixth embodiment). The telephone number is determined as follows. Between bases, a prefix \u201c7\u201d is used like \u201c7-area number-extension number\u201d for an IP telephone call made to a different base.",
        "It has already been discussed in the first embodiment that under the condition that the wireless communication apparatus does not know the state of TCP connection from the wireless communication apparatus to the session managing server, the TCP connection is cut somewhere in the internet path in some cases. In order to allow the wireless communication apparatus to confirm that the TCP connection is cut somewhere in the internet path, as shown in FIG. 65, the session managing server sends \u201cHTTP GET status response\u201d, except the body section in response to \u201cHTTP GET method\u201d received from the wireless communication apparatus. Then, the body section is sent back upon reception of an establishment request of a session. The session managing server sends \u201cKeep-Alive information\u201d as part of the body section to the wireless communication apparatus in a fixed cycle until the establishment request of a session is received. The wireless communication apparatus, in the case of not receiving the body section (Keep-Alive information) even with the timeout, makes a request for reconnection with the session managing server. In this case, information notifying of its reconnection may be added to data in the GET method. Consequently, if arrival information arrived a little later than the timeout, the session managing server may reply with the reception or arrival information, which was supposed to be sent after confirming that it is a request for reconnection, as the body section.",
        "On the other hand, the wireless communication apparatus may also transmit and receive voice information by using HTTP or with the TCP connection secured. For that reason, if the TCP connection is cut similarly, then the transmission and reception of voice information is interrupted.",
        "Then, as shown in FIG. 66, also with the transmission and reception of voice information, in the case of HTTP used somewhere in the voice information transmission and reception path, Keep-Alive information is transmitted and received in a fixed cycle through the same TCP connection, regardless of whether voice information exists or not. As a result, when a wireless communication apparatus as the destination of the voice information detects a timeout, the TCP connection may be retried. This may prevent the transmission and reception of voice information from being interrupted.",
        "In addition, voice information may be transmitted and received with a single communication relay server or even two communication relay servers. With the latter case, the TCP reconnection is needed to be made not only by the wireless communication apparatus of the destination of the voice information, but also by the wireless communication apparatus of the transmitting source thereof. The instruction of this TCP reconnection maybe transmitted to the wireless communication apparatus of the transmitting source through the session managing server in the same manner as that of the first embodiment where the off -hook information of the wireless communication apparatus is notified to the wireless communication apparatus of the destination. Thus, the TCP reconnection is made by the wireless communication apparatuses on both sides of the transmitting source and the destination of the voice information. Hence, even if the TCP connection is cut somewhere on the Internet, the transmission of voice information is allowed to continue.",
        "With referring to FIG. 66, the wireless communication apparatus 120 inserts \u201cKeep-Alive information\u201d between pieces of voice information in a fixed cycle, and transmits it to the wireless communication apparatus 110. The wireless communication apparatus 110 waits for the \u201cKeep-Alive information\u201d from the wireless communication apparatus 120. The wireless communication apparatus 110, if not receiving the \u201cKeep-Alive information\u201d with a timeout, makes a request for TCP reconnection to the calling party's call relay server 310. At the same time, the wireless communication apparatus 110 instructs the wireless communication apparatus 120 of the called party through the session managing server to reconnect the call relay server.",
        "The wireless communication apparatuses discussed hereinbefore transmit and receive voice data. The voice data is obtained by converting voice analog data inputted to the wireless communication apparatus through such as a microphone speaker device (one example of voice input unit) of the wireless communication apparatus into voice digital data by means of an analog-to-digital conversion device or software installed in the wireless communication apparatus, and further converting the voice digital data into compressed voice data by means of a voice codec (a voice coder and decoder, or software) which is installed in the wireless communication apparatus.",
        "Compressed voice data per unit time to be subject to voice encoding and decoding by this voice codec is called voice frame data. In the case of transmitting voice data over the IP network, one or more pieces of this voice frame data are accumulated to form an IP packet. The number of pieces of voice frame data to be stored in a single IP packet is determined by the wireless communication apparatus specifying a suitable accumulation time in consideration of quality based on the traffic congestion of the IP network and delay time. For example, the time length of voice frame data becomes 20 msec, and the accumulation time becomes 60 msec. In this case, three pieces of voice frame data are to be stored in a single IP packet.",
        "As shown in FIG. 67, according to the conventional method, voice frame data is generated after 20 msec, and stored mechanically in an IP packet. Then, an IP packet is automatically transmitted after each 60 msec.",
        "On the other hand, there is a method called silent compression. According to this method, voice lower than a fixed level in quantity is regarded as silent. Hence, it is designed not to generate voice frame data so as not to transmit unnecessary IP packets.",
        "Now, it is to be noted that the voice codec generates in many cases voice frame data indicating that ending is voiced when having silence after contiguous voiced sound. Based on the voice frame data indicating that ending is voiced, a voice codec is allowed to reproduce natural voice attenuation and disappearance on the reception side. On the other hand, bit information called marker bit may be turned ON with the first voice frame data after the sound changed from silence to voiced. This shows the voice codec on the reception side the resumption of voiced sound. Hence, voice may be reproduced with a natural rising edge. In addition, on the reception side, natural background sound is supplied to the user by reproducing suitable noise in silence with no voice data arriving.",
        "The voice codec by the silent compression method on the reception side receives the voice frame data indicating that ending is voiced and the voice frame data having the marker bit turned ON indicating the resumption of voiced sound discussed hereinbefore. This allows reproducing natural shift between a voiced state and a silent state. On the other hand, if the voice codec on the reception side fails to receive either one of the voice frame data indicating that ending is voiced and the voice frame data having the marker bit indicating the resumption of voiced sound being turned ON, then loss may occur at the rising edge of voiced sound, unpleasant noise may occur, distortion may occur at the end of voiced sound, or the like.",
        "Consequently, as shown in FIG. 68, according to this conventional method, in the case where a substantive transmission delay fluctuation of IP packets occurs, only an IP packet including the voice frame data indicating that ending is voiced may arrive with a substantive delay from the preceding voiced voice frame data. In that case, silent compression based reproduction process of the voice codec on the reception side may be affected. As a result, distortion may occur at the end of voiced sound if the IP packet is not damaged.",
        "In addition, with referring to FIG. 69, an IP packet including the voice frame data indicating that the ending is voiced may arrive late as illustrated, and soon after that the voice frame data having the marker bit turned ON indicating the resumption of incoming voiced sound may arrive. In this case, the end of voiced sound and the start of voiced sound are instructed in series in a short time to the voice codec on the reception side. As a result, loss may occur at the rising edge of voiced sound, or unpleasant noise may occur.",
        "For that reason, as shown in FIG. 70, according to the present invention, it is designed to maintain the quality of voice even in the case where the IP network has substantive delay fluctuation as mentioned above. Specifically, in the case where the voice frame data indicating that ending is voiced is generated by the voice codec on the transmission side, the formation of an IP packet is immediately stopped there regardless of the accumulation time of an IP packet, and then the IP packet is transmitted over the IP network. As a result, the voice codec by the silent compression on the reception side is allowed to reproduce natural voice attenuation and disappearance and voice may be reproduced with a natural rising edge on the reception side.",
