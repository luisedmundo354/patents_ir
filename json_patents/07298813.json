        "This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-062645, filed on Mar. 7, 2005, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an X-ray computed tomographic apparatus which scans a subject by helical scanning, and reconstructs image data in an ECG-gated reconstruction method on the basis of the obtained data.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "An X-ray computed tomographic apparatus provides information concerning a subject in the form of images on the basis of the intensities of X-rays transmitted through the subject, and plays an important role in many medical activities including diagnoses and medical treatments for diseases, surgical planning, and the like.",
        "It is an important challenge to improve the time resolution of images in examinations on subjects with fast movement, especially in cardiac examinations, which use X-ray computed tomographic apparatuses. A main method for this challenge is a combination of a half reconstruction method and an ECG-gated reconstruction method. As is known, image data is reconstructed by a projection data set acquired while an X-ray tube rotates in the range of 180\u00b0+\u03b1 (where \u03b1 is the fan angle) centered on the phase of the movement of the heart which is designated by an operator. Recently, attempts have been made to apply a half ECG-gated reconstruction method to helical scanning operation using a detector corresponding to multislice operation (multi-row detector).",
        "FIG. 10 shows a data existing range (the paths of the respective detector rows) together with an electrocardiogram (ECG), with the abscissa representing time and the ordinate representing the position on the Z-axis (body axis). Data sets in the 180\u00b0+\u03b1 ranges (thick lines) centered on designated phases on slices Z1 and Z2 are generated by helical interpolation, and tomographic images are reconstructed from the generated data sets. Likewise, tomographic images of a plurality of slices are reconstructed at predetermined intervals. In an actual examination, by using tomographic images of a plurality of slices, an image of a section in an arbitrary direction crossing them is generated by MPR (Multi-Planar Reformatting).",
        "For example, an image of the slice Z1 originates from a data set at a second heartbeat 2, and an image of the adjacent slice Z2 originates from a data set at a third heartbeat 3. Since an MPR image is generated by partially combining images in different heartbeat periods, banding artifacts (a plurality of discontinuities in an image) are produced in an MPR image due to body movement such as respirations during heartbeat periods, as exemplified by FIG. 7A.",

        "An X-ray computed tomographic apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the several views of the accompanying drawing. Note that X-ray computed tomographic apparatuses include various types of apparatuses, e.g., a rotate/rotate-type apparatus in which an X-ray tube and X-ray detector rotate together around a subject, and a stationary/rotate-type apparatus in which many detection elements are arrayed in the form of a ring, and only an X-ray tube rotates around a subject. The present invention can be applied to either type. In this case, the rotate/rotate type, which is currently the mainstream, will be exemplified. In order to reconstruct 1-slice tomographic image data, about 360\u00b0 projection data corresponding to one rotation around a subject is required, or 180\u00b0+\u03b1 (where \u03b1 is a fan angle) projection data is required in the half scan method. This embodiment uses the half scan method which is effective in imaging the heart and the like with fast movement. As mechanisms of converting incident X-rays into electric charges, the following techniques are the mainstream: an indirect conversion type that converts X-rays into light through a phosphor such as a scintillator and converts the light into electric charges through photoelectric conversion elements such as photodiodes, and a direct conversion type that uses generation of electron-hole pairs in a semiconductor by X-rays and movement of the electron-hole pairs to an electrode, i.e., a photoconductive phenomenon. As an X-ray detection element, either of these schemes can be used. In this case, the former type, i.e., the indirect conversion type, will be exemplified. Recently, with advances toward the commercialization of a so-called multi-tube type X-ray computed tomographic apparatus having a plurality of pairs of X-ray tubes and X-ray detectors mounted on a rotating ring, related techniques have been developed. The present invention can be applied to both a conventional single-tube type X-ray computed tomographic apparatus and a multi-tube type X-ray computed tomographic apparatus. In this case, the single-tube type X-ray computed tomographic apparatus will be exemplified here.",
        "FIG. 1 shows the arrangement of an X-ray computed tomographic apparatus according to this embodiment. This X-ray computed tomographic apparatus has a gantry apparatus 1 configured to acquire projection data concerning a subject. The gantry apparatus 1 has an X-ray tube 101 and a multislice type X-ray detector 102. The X-ray tube 101 and the X-ray detector 102 are mounted on a ring-like rotating frame 103 which is rotated/driven by a gantry driving device 105. The rotation axis of the rotating frame 103 is defined as the Z-axis. In this case, a rotary coordinate system centered on the Z-axis is specified. An axis perpendicular to the Z-axis connecting the focal point of the X-ray tube 101 and the center of the detection surface of the X-ray detector 102 is defined as the X-axis. The Y-axis is perpendicular to both the Z-axis and the X-axis.",
        "An opening portion is formed in the central portion of the rotating frame 103. A subject P placed on a top 302 of a bed device 3 is inserted in the opening portion. In order to detect an electrocardiogram of the subject P, an electrocardiograph 106 is mounted on the subject P. Note that the electrocardiograph 106 is mounted as a device for measuring a biometric signal of the subject P. This device may be a respirometer which measures the periodical respiratory movement of the subject P.",
        "A high voltage generator 104 applies a tube voltage (high voltage) between the cathode and anode of the X-ray tube 101. In addition, the high voltage generator 104 supplies a filament current to the filament of the X-ray tube 101. X-rays are generated by applying a tube voltage and supplying a filament current to the X-ray tube 101.",
        "The multislice type X-ray detector 102 has a plurality of X-ray detection elements each having, for example, a 0.5 mm\u00d70.5 mm square light-receiving surface. For example, 916 X-ray detection elements are arrayed in a channel direction (approximate to the Y-axis). For example, 40 such rows are arranged side by side in a slice direction (Z-axis). The X-ray detector 102 may be a so-called two-dimensional array type X-ray detector having a plurality of X-ray detection elements arranged in the form of a matrix along the X- and Y-axes.",
        "A data acquisition device 107 generally called a DAS (Data Acquisition System) converts a signal output from the X-ray detector 102 for each channel into a voltage signal, amplifies it, and converts it into a digital signal. This data (also called raw data) is supplied to a computer main body 2 outside the gantry. A pre-processing unit 202 of the computer main body 2 performs correction processing such as sensitivity correction for the data (raw data) output from the data acquisition device 107. The pre-processed raw data is generally called projection data. The projection data is stored in a projection data storage unit 203 of the computer main body 2, together with the electrocardiogram data from the electrocardiograph 106, in association with codes representing a view angle representing the rotational angle of the X-ray tube 101, a channel number, a row number, and the position of the top 302.",
        "In addition to the pre-processing unit 202 and the projection data storage unit 203, the computer main body 2 has a scan control unit 201, helical interpolation processing unit 204, weighting/adding processing unit 205, image reconstruction processing unit 206, weight generating unit 207, projection data selecting unit 208, image storage unit 209, MPR processing unit (Multi-Planar Reformatting) 210, display device 211, and input device 212. The projection data selecting unit 208 performs read control for the projection data storage unit 203 with respect to at least projection data in an angle range necessary for half reconstruction which corresponds to a slice (a position on the Z-axis) designated from the input device 212 and a heartbeat phase designated from the input device 212, i.e., projection data corresponding to the angle range of 180\u00b0+fan angle \u03b1 in this embodiment.",
        "The helical interpolation processing unit 204 generates a plurality of data sets at the same slice position in different heartbeat periods by performing distance interpolation, centered on a slice designated from the input device 212, for data in the angle range of 180\u00b0+fan angle \u03b1 centered on a heartbeat phase (specific phase) designated from the input device 212 (data corresponding to the angle range of 180\u00b0+fan angle \u03b1 will be simply referred to as a data set hereinafter). One data set covers the angle range (180\u00b0+fan angle \u03b1) required for the reconstruction of 1-frame image data.",
        "A single or a plurality of slices may be designated. However, multislice helical scanning is often directed to generate volume data or MPR images (multi-planar reformatted images). Typically, many slices are often designated at once with reconstruction ranges extending in the Z-axis direction (which are called D-FOVs in distinction from scan ranges S-FOVs) and slice intervals.",
        "Distance interpolation using the helical interpolation processing unit 204 is a general technique, in which projection data at different Z positions, typically two different Z-positions, on both sides of a designated slice are weighted and added in accordance with the distances from the designated slice. Repeating this processing for each of a plurality of view angles within the angle range of 180\u00b0+fan angle \u03b1 makes it possible to prepare data sets concerning the designated slice described above. In this embodiment, a plurality of data sets in different heartbeat periods are generated for each slice.",
        "The weighting/adding processing unit 205 generates a single data set for each slice by weighting/adding a plurality of data sets concerning the same slice in different heartbeat periods, which are generated by the helical interpolation processing unit 204, by using weights determined for the respective data sets and generated by the weight generating unit 207. Reconstructed tomographic image data concerning a plurality of slices are stored in the image storage unit 209, together with codes representing the respective slice positions. The MPR processing unit 210 generates volume data as a voxel aggregate from tomographic image data concerning a plurality of slices by performing interpolation between the slices using an arbitrary technique. The MPR processing unit 210 also generates tomographic image data concerning a designated slice in an arbitrary direction from volume data. The generated tomographic image data is displayed on the display device 211.",
        "FIG. 2A shows an outline of the flow of image reconstruction processing for one slice corresponding to a fan beam in this embodiment. FIG. 3 shows the overall flow of processing between helical scanning (data acquisition) and the generation of an MPR image in this embodiment. Image reconstruction processing in this embodiment will be described with reference to FIG. 4. FIG. 4 shows a data existing range (the paths of the respective detector rows) extending obliquely, together with an electrocardiogram (ECG), with the abscissa representing time and the ordinate representing the position on the Z-axis (body axis). Referring to FIG. 4, the band (to be referred to as the designated phase band) of the angle range of 180\u00b0+fan angle \u03b1 centered on a heartbeat phase (specific phase) designated from the input device 212 is indicated by the oblique lines.",
        "First of all, helical scanning is executed with a designated helical pitch throughout a designated range by using the multiple rows of the X-ray detector 102 (S11). When the helical scanning operation is complete, the acquired projection data are stored in the projection data storage unit 203. The projection data selecting unit 208 then specifies a range RZ1 in which a slice Z1 crosses the data existing range (S12). The range RZ1 represents a range in which projection data on the slice Z1 can be prepared by helical interpolation (interpolation). At least two ranges RS(Z1B2) and RS(Z1B3) which fall within this data existing range and in which the designated slice Z1 crosses at least two adjacent designated phase bands in different heartbeat periods are determined (S13). Note that a helical pitch as a distance that the top 302 moves within the time required for one rotation of the rotating frame 103 is properly set in advance such that a designated slice crosses designated phase bands in at least two adjacent heartbeat periods which fall within the data existing range.",
        "The projection data selecting unit 208 further specifies two positions S1 and S2 on detector row paths which are nearest to each other and located on both sides of the designated slice Z1 for each of discrete sampling points SP on the respective data set ranges RS(Z1B2) and RS(Z1B3). The helical interpolation processing unit 204 weights/adds specified projection data in accordance with the distances from the slice Z1. This helical interpolation processing is repeated for each of a plurality of sampling points SP in the angle ranges RS(Z1B2) and RS(Z1B3) of 180\u00b0+fan angle \u03b1, i.e., each of view point on the rotation path of the focal point of the X-ray tube which are interspaced from each other at intervals of 2\u00b0 or the like, thereby preparing two data sets SEG(Z1B2) and SEG(Z1B3) concerning the slice Z1.",
        "The weight generating unit 207 determines weights for the two data sets SEG(Z1B2) and ZEG(Z1B3) concerning the slice Z1 in different heartbeat periods (S14). Weights are determined for the respective data sets SEG(Z1B2) and SEG(Z1B3) in accordance with distances (time widths) D1 and S2 from the center of the range RZ1 in which the slice Z1 crosses the data existing range to the centers of the respective angle ranges RS(Z1B2) and RS(Z1B3).",
        "Weights are determined in accordance with intervals D1 and D2 from the center of the range RZ1 in which the data sets SEG(Z1B2) and SEG(Z1B3) concerning the slice position Z1 in the angle range of 180\u00b0+fan angle can be prepared by helical interpolation to the centers of the angle ranges RS(Z1B2) and RS(Z1B3) of the respective data set. As shown in FIG. 4, as the center of each of the angle ranges RS(Z1B2) and RS(Z1B3) of the respective data sets approaches the center of the range R1, i.e., the distance D decreases, a weight is determined such that its value becomes higher, i.e., the value becomes nearer to \u201c1\u201d in this case. There are various concrete methods of determining weights. For example, as shown in FIG. 5A, the value of a weight is determined by a linear function that linearly decreases from the center of a range RZ in which a data set in an angle range RS of 180\u00b0+fan angle which concerns a designated slice can be prepared from data by interpolation to an end of the range. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 5B, the value of a weight is determined such that the value approximately changes in a trapezoidal shape from the center of the range RZ in which a data set in the angle range RS of 180\u00b0+fan angle which concerns a designated slice can be prepared from data by interpolation to an end of the range. Alternatively, as shown in FIGS. 5C and 5D, the values of weights are determined by various kinds of curve functions that gradually decrease in the form of curves from the center of the range RZ in which a data set in the angle range RS of 180\u00b0+fan angle which concerns a designated slice can be prepared from data by interpolation to an end of the range.",
        "Weights may also be determined in the following manner. According to the above description, a weight is determined in accordance with the distance (time width) D from the center of the range RZ in which a designated slice crosses the data existing range to the center of the angle range RS. As indicated by equation (1) below, however, as the value obtained by subtracting the absolute value of the distance (time width) D from \u00bd of a width VP1 of the range RZ in which a designated slice crosses the data existing range, i.e., the distance from an end of the range RZ, increases, a weight may be determined such that its value becomes higher, i.e., the value becomes nearer to \u201c1\u201d in this case. According to equation (1), weights are normalized such that the total of the weights with respect to the respective data sets becomes 1. Determining a weight in accordance with the distance from an end of the range in this manner makes it possible to cope with a specific situation in which the center of the data set range RS coincides with the center of the range RZ. In this specific situation, according to the weight determination method shown in FIG. 4, the distance D becomes zero, and hence weights may diverge.",
