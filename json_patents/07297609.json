        "This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2004-0117029, filed on Dec. 30, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, and more particularly, to a method for fabricating a semiconductor device, in which a silicon nitride layer is formed on a lower surface of a semiconductor substrate to prevent the lower surface of the semiconductor substrate from being contaminated by copper during a copper line formation process.",
        "2. Discussion of the Related Art",
        "Device isolation of a semiconductor device may be achieved by local oxidation of silicon or by shallow-trench isolation. FIGS. 1A-1E illustrate a conventional method for fabricating a semiconductor device using shallow-trench isolation.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1A, a semiconductor substrate 100 having an active area and a non-active area is prepared. A pad oxide layer 101 and a pad nitride layer 107 are sequentially deposited on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate 100.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1B, a photoresist is coated on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate 100, including the pad oxide layer 101 and the pad nitride layer 107, and is then patterned by photolithography, thereby forming a photoresist pattern PR on the pad nitride layer 107. The photoresist is patterned to cover the active area of the semiconductor substrate 100. Subsequently, the exposed portion of the pad oxide layer 101 is etched and removed with the patterned photoresist PR used as a mask.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1C, after removing the photoresist pattern PR, the exposed pad oxide layer 101 and the semiconductor substrate 100 are removed with the patterned pad nitride layer 107 used as a mask. Thus, a trench 102 is formed in the non-active area of the semiconductor substrate 100.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1D, an insulating layer is deposited on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate 100, including the trench 102. The deposited insulating layer is then planarized by chemical-mechanical polishing until the pad nitride layer 107 is exposed. Thus, the insulating layer is selectively formed inside the trench 102. In this case, the insulating layer of the trench 102 serves as a device isolation layer 103.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1E, the device isolation layer 103 is exposed by removing the patterned pad oxide layer 101 and the pad nitride layer 107.",
        "However, the semiconductor substrate may become contaminated if copper permeates an exposed lower surface of the semiconductor substrate during a subsequent copper line formation process.",
        "Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method for fabricating a semiconductor device that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.",
        "The present invention provides a method for fabricating a semiconductor device in which a silicon nitride layer is formed on a lower surface of a semiconductor substrate to prevent the lower surface of the semiconductor substrate from being contaminated by copper during a copper line formation process.",
        "Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.",
        "To achieve these and other advantages in accordance with the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a method for fabricating a semiconductor device comprises sequentially forming a pad oxide layer and a pad nitride layer on a substrate, the pad oxide layer including a first oxide layer formed on an upper surface of the substrate and a second oxide layer formed on a lower surface of the substrate, and the pad nitride layer including a first nitride layer formed on the upper surface of the substrate and a second nitride layer formed on the lower surface of the substrate; patterning the first nitride layer by removing a portion of the first nitride layer; forming a trench in the substrate corresponding to the removed portion of the first nitride layer, thereby patterning the first oxide layer; filling the trench with an insulating material to form a device isolation layer; forming a passivation layer on the substrate, the passivation layer including a first passivation layer formed on the upper surface of the substrate including the device isolation layer, and a second passivation layer formed on the lower surface of the substrate including the second oxide layer and the second nitride layer; and removing the first passivation layer, the patterned first oxide layer, and patterned first nitride layer.",
        "It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.",
        "The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding of the invention illustrate exemplary embodiments of the invention and together with the description serve to explain the principle of the invention. In the drawings:",
        "FIGS. 1A-1E are cross-sectional views of a semiconductor device fabricated in accordance with a conventional method;",
        "FIGS. 2A-2H are cross-sectional views of a semiconductor device fabricated in accordance with an first exemplary embodiment of the present invention; and",
        "FIGS. 3A-3G are cross-sectional views of a semiconductor device fabricated in accordance with an second exemplary embodiment of the present invention.",
        "Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, like reference designations will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or similar parts.",
        "FIGS. 2A-2H illustrate a semiconductor device fabricated in accordance with an first exemplary embodiment of the present invention.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2A, a semiconductor substrate 200, including an active area and a non-active area, is prepared. A pad oxide layer 201 and a pad nitride layer 207 are sequentially deposited on the entire upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 200. The pad nitride layer 207 can be formed of silicon nitride. The remaining portions of a semiconductor device will be formed on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 200.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2B, a photoresist is coated on the entire upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 200, including the pad oxide layer 201 and the pad nitride layer 207, and the coated photoresist is then patterned by photolithography. Thus, a photoresist pattern PR is formed on the pad nitride layer 207 provided on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 200. At this time, the photoresist is patterned to cover the active area of the semiconductor substrate 200. With the photoresist pattern PR used as a mask, the exposed pad oxide layer 201 is etched and removed.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2C, after removing the photoresist pattern PR, the exposed pad oxide layer 201 and the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 200 are removed with the patterned nitride layer 207 used as a mask, thereby forming a trench 202 in the non-active area of the semiconductor substrate 200.",
        "Although not shown, when performing an etching process with the photoresist pattern PR used as a mask, the pad oxide layer 201, the pad nitride layer 207 and the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 200 may be etched in sequence to form the trench 202 in the non-active area of the semiconductor substrate 200.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2D, an insulating layer is deposited on the entire upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 200, including the trench 202, and then chemical-mechanical polishing is performed to the deposited insulating layer. The deposited insulating layer is planarized until the pad nitride layer 207 is exposed. As a result, the insulating layer is selectively formed inside the trench 202. The insulating layer formed inside the trench 202 functions as a device isolation layer 203.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2E, a passivation layer 204 is formed on each of the entire lower and upper surfaces of the semiconductor substrate 200. Thus, the passivation layer 204 formed on the entire upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 200 covers the device isolation layer 203, the patterned pad oxide layer 201 and the pad nitride layer 207. The passivation layer 204 formed on the entire lower surface of the semiconductor substrate 200 covers the pad oxide layer 201, and the pad nitride layer 207. At this time, the passivation layer 204 prevents the pad nitride layer 207 formed on the lower surface of the semiconductor substrate 200 from being etched. The passivation layer 204 can be formed of tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate.",

        "As shown in FIG. 3A, a semiconductor substrate 300 having an active area and a non-active area is prepared. A pad oxide layer 301, a pad nitride layer 307 and a passivation layer 304 are then sequentially deposited on the entire upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 300. At the same time, a pad oxide layer 301, a pad nitride layer 307 and a passivation layer 304 are sequentially deposited on an entire lower surface of the semiconductor substrate 300. The pad nitride layer 307 can be formed of silicon nitride. The passivation layer 304 prevents the pad nitride layer 307 formed on the lower surface of the semiconductor substrate 300 from being etched, wherein the passivation layer 304 can be formed of tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate. The remaining portions of the semiconductor device are to be formed on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 300.",
        "As shown in FIG. 3B, a photoresist is coated on the entire upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 300, and the coated photoresist is patterned by photolithography.

        "As shown in FIG. 3D, after removing the photoresist pattern PR, the exposed pad oxide layer 301 and the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 300 are removed with the patterned pad nitride layer 307 used as a mask. As a result, a trench 302 is formed in the non-active area of the semiconductor substrate 300.",
        "Although not shown, when performing an etching process with the photoresist pattern PR used as a mask, the photoresist pattern PR may remain, and the pad oxide layer 301, the pad nitride layer 307 and the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 300 may be etched in sequence to form the trench 302 in the non-active area of the semiconductor substrate 300.",
        "As shown in FIG. 3E, after removing the passivation layer 304 formed on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate, an insulating layer is deposited on the entire upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 300, and is then planarized until the pad nitride layer 307 is exposed by chemical-mechanical polishing. Thus, the insulating layer is selectively formed inside the trench 302, wherein the insulating layer of the trench 302 serves as a device isolation layer 303.",

        "The pad nitride layer 307 formed below the lower surface of the semiconductor substrate 300 prevents the lower substrate of the semiconductor substrate 300 from being contaminated when performing a copper line formation process. The copper of the pad nitride layer is prevented from permeating into the lower surface of the semiconductor substrate.",
