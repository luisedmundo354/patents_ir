        "Genus and species: Petunia hybrida Vilm.",
        "Variety denomination: \u2018Sunsurfcopasamo\u2019.",
        "The present invention comprises a new and distinct cultivar of petunia, botanically known as Petunia hybrida Vilm., and hereinafter referred to by the cultivar name \u2018Sunsurfcopasamo\u2019. The new cultivar originated from a hybridization made in May 2002 in Higashiomi, Shiga, Japan. The female parent was a cultivar petunia plant \u2018Fantasy Crystal Red\u2019 (unpatented), while the male parent was a proprietary petunia plant \u2018P01-583\u2019 (unpatented).",
        "The new cultivar was created in 2002 in Higashiomi, Shiga, Japan and has been asexually reproduced repeatedly by vegetative cuttings in Higashiomi, Shiga, Japan. The present invention has been found to retain its distinctive characteristics through successive asexual propagations.",
        "The following are the most outstanding and distinguishing characteristics of this new cultivar when grown under normal horticultural practices in Higashiomi, Shiga, Japan.\n\n    \n    \n        A) Single, medium-size, pink flowers with red-purple venation;\n        B) Abundant branching with a great profusion of blooms;\n        C) Compact and mounding plant habit;\n        D) Whole plant remains in bloom for a considerable period of time; and\n        E) Excellent tolerance to low temperatures.",
        "This new petunia plant is illustrated by the accompanying photographs which show blooms and foliage of the plant in full color, the colors shown being as true as can be reasonably obtained by conventional photographic procedures. The photographs are of a 4-month-old plant grown in a greenhouse in Higashiomi, Shiga, Japan.",
        "FIG. 1 shows the overall plant habit, including blooms, buds and foliage.",
        "FIG. 2 shows mature flowers.",
        "The following detailed description sets forth the distinctive characteristics of \u2018Sunsurfcopasamo\u2019. The data which define these characteristics were collected from asexual reproductions carried out in Higashiomi, Shiga, Japan. The plant history was taken on 4-month old plants which were planted as rooted cuttings in 15-cm pots in 2005 and grown in a greenhouse between 13\u00b0 C. and 23\u00b0 C. The plants were pinched once in April 2005. Observations were made when the plants were in full flower in June 2005. Color readings were taken under natural light in the greenhouse. Color references are primarily to The R.H.S. Colour Chart of The Royal Horticultural Society of London (R.H.S.) (2001).",
