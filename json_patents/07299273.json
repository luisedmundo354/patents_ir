        "The present invention relates to the field of information dissemination over a computer network. More particularly the invention relates to client server architecture in a computer network where clients seek information items from the server by generating request messages and receiving data messages.",
        "Modem computer networks often involve systems/agents/servers that are required to maintain (have) a large database of information (Items). For example, yahoo.com provides news, stock market quotes, sports information, multimedia content etc involving a multitude of large databases. The databases are used to serve requests for subsets of items of information from various client systems (Information seekers/Seekers).",
        "The most obvious manner of fulfilling the requests is by sending the requested subsets of items to each individual client. This approach however may burden the computational resources of the server as well as the network resources. Alternatively, the server could broadcast all items to all information seekers and the individual recipients would then extract the information required by it. This solution results in inefficient utilization of the network bandwidth while at the same time burdening each recipient with the task of searching through an enormous amount of information. One manner of resolving the contradicting requirements on computational costs at the server as well as at the client system is to group items that are requested by groups of clients and then furnish the set of responses to the corresponding groups of clients. In this manner, a tradeoff between the contradicting requirements can be achieved that optimizes a global objective.",
        "There are various types of costs involved in servicing the requests from clients. The server will incur some cost each time it sends an information bundle across to the clients.",
        "A given client may not receive exact number of items that it has requested; it may receive more/less number of items than that the requested number. There is a cost associated with each item that a client did not receive. Also, there is a cost associated with each item it received and did not request for, because the client has an additional burden to prune such extra information.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 5,805,823 provides a system and method for optimal multiplexed message aggregation between client applications in a client-server network. This invention provides for a message architecture that multiplexes messages to a client. This invention does a plain simple aggregation of messages and not of clients. Further the aggregation done is plain and simple and no optimisation technique is defined in order to save on computational resources.",
        "US patent Publication Ser. No. 2002020124101A1 relates to server side optimization of content delivery to clients by selective in-advance delivery to enable performance optimization based on the current load of the server. This invention based on probabilistic measure delivers the content in advance to the clients. It does not take into consideration the actual requests by one or more clients.",
        "US patent Publication Ser. No. 20010027494A1 bundles one or more messages destined for the same address or sub-address. The data packets are managed only for the same client and the computing devices being served by it. The bundling is done based on the user-defined time limit or the packet size. The invention does not disclose any method wherein an optimisation between bundling the messages as against transmitting them alone is achieved.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,994 provides a system and method for bundling messages for transmission in a telecommunications network. This patent bundles one or more messages intended only for a particular client and does not take into consideration other clients having the requests for the same information item. Thereby though this patent reduces the bandwidth requirement, it does nothing to tackle the processing overhead involved at the server or at the client end.",
        "The object of the present invention is to minimize the overall cost of satisfying clients' requests by simultaneously clustering the clients and their requests. The optimization covers computational costs at both the server and the client.",
        "To achieve the said objective the proposed invention first formulates the various costs involved in serving requests from various clients. The invention then applies a method and system for simultaneously clustering clients and items. The clustering is carried-out over a number of requests and clients over a range of configurable pre-defined values and calculates the costs involved for each chosen cluster number value. The invention uses a fuzzy clustering algorithm for simultaneously clustering the clients and items so as to minimize the overall cost of satisfying the clients' requests.",

The clients and the server communicate using any of the known communication protocols such as TCP/IP or Ethernet. The number of servers and the clients is not limited and the data could reside either on one server or could be distributed over a number of servers. The server (1.6) acts as the information store and clients are seekers of information sending requests to the server for information items contained therein.",
        "The clients (1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5) comprise be electronic devices such as personal computers, mobile phones, interactive televisions and the like, operated by humans or software agents operating on behalf of individuals or organizations.",
        "FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of a general computing system (2.1) on which the invention might be practiced. The computer system (2.1) consists of various subsystems interconnected with the help of a system bus (2.2). The microprocessor (2.3) communicates and controls the functioning of other subsystems. The microprocessor (2.3) also acts as the control unit operating in conjunction with memory (2.4) to perform operations as defined by the stored instructions. In a general computer system the control module is any commercially available processor of which \u00d786 processors from Intel and 680X0 series from Motorola are examples. The computing system could be a single processor system or may use two or more processors on a single system or over a network. This control module also controls the functioning of the other components of the computing system (not shown). Control module (2.3) accesses said memory (2.4) through system bus (2.2) that interconnects the various parts of the computing device. The control module executes a program called the operating system for the basic functioning of the computer system. Some examples of operating systems are UNIX, WINDOWS and DOS. These operating systems allocate the computer system resources to various programs and facilitate the interaction of users with the system. Memory (2.4) supports the microprocessor in its functioning by storing instructions and data required for program execution. Examples of memory are random access memory devices such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) or static memory (SRAM). Storage Device (2.5) is used to hold the data and instructions permanent in nature such as the operating system and other programs. Video Interface (2.6) is used as an interface between the system bus and the display device (2.7), which is generally a video display unit such as a monitor. The network interface (2.8) is used to connect the computer with other computers on a network which can be either a Local Area Network (LAN) or a Wide Area Network (WAN) or any other type of computer network, through wired or wireless means. This networking interface can also be used to connect to the Internet. The computer system might also contain a sound card (2.9). The system is connected to various input devices like keyboard (2.11) and mouse (2.12) and output devices like printer (2.13), through an input/output Interface (2.10). Various configurations of these subsystems are possible. It should also be noted that a system implementing the present invention might use less or more number of the subsystems than described above.",
        "In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the instructions are stored on the storage device (2.5) in the form of a computer program. This program contains coded instructions for different algorithms described herein the specification. On running the program, the instructions are transferred to the memory (2.4) and the microprocessor (2.3) executes the instructions. The system can be manually controlled by giving instructions through means of input devices such as keyboard (2.11) and mouse (2.12). Instructions, whether from the program or from the user input reside in the memory (2.4) and are subsequently acted upon by the microprocessor (2.3). It should be understood that the invention is not limited to any particular hardware comprising the computer system or the software running on it.",
        "Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the various means for generating service requests by the clients and their processing by the server are computer programs. These programs are capable of existing in an embedded form within the hardware of the system or may be embodied on various computer readable media. The computer readable media may take the form of coded formats that are decoded for actual use in a particular information processing system. Computer program means or a computer program in the present context mean any expression, in any language, code, or notation, of a set of instructions intended to cause a system having information processing capability to perform the particular function either directly or after performing either or both of the following:\n\n    \n    \n        a) conversion to another language, code or notation\n        b) reproduction in a different material form.",

        "The invention proposes to solve the aforementioned problem of optimization through clustering of clients and items. The basic steps involved are highlighted in FIG. 3. Firstly a range of values for the number of clusters is defined and K is set to the minimum value (3.1). Using the data of clients' requests (3.2), clients (seekers) and items are simultaneously clustered into \u2018K\u2019 clusters (3.3). The cost of processing with the resulting clusters of items and clients is then calculated (3.4). If the present cost is less than the minimum cost obtained previously (if any) (3.5) then present cost is stored as the minimum cost. Also, the present number of clusters is classified as optimum number of clusters. Next step increments K by 1 (3.6). If K becomes greater than the maximum value of clusters defined (3.7) then optimum number of clusters as stored is output and items and clients are clustered using this number (3.8). Steps 3.3 to 3.6 are repeated till maximum value for clusters is reached. The method of simultaneously clustering items and clients (3.3) is explained below in more detail:",

        "The solution operates by finding R and S that minimizes \u03c6(R, S, K) for various values of K over a given range, and then selecting a K that minimizes the objective function. An optimization algorithm based on fuzzy set theory that optimizes \u03c6(R, S, K) for a given K, denoted as \u03c6(R, S) for simplicity is given below. For a given K, the solution optimizes",
