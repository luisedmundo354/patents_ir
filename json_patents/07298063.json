        "The prior art electric generator, a device which resist rotation; this resistance cause losses which reduce efficiency. This device generally incorporate a single cylindrical rotor per unit which is not cost effective, and is therefore inadequate; for the generating of electricity with respect to the growing energy consumption in general.",
        "Accordingly, the desire and need exists to develop a new form of generator on a format which will produce large amount of electricity at a low cost. My present innovation was designed to fulfill that need as its objective.",
        "This innovation present a new format on which to build electric generator for the present and distance future. This device incorporate plurality of permanent magnet discs used as polefaces are disposed on a armature shaft. Plurality of discs with windings form the armature which are also disposed on said armature shaft, with each armature situated between two permanent magnet polefaces. The armatures are attach to the shaft, said shaft is supported at each end by endframe and rotate there-between. elongated support struts are placed between both endframes and fixedly attach thereto, said struts are part of the framework which support the endframes and also each poleface in the unit attach thereto. The wiring from the armature is taken along a duct cut in the length of the shaft, to a commutator and brush assembly at the output end of said shaft. When a torque is applied to the input shaft, said shaft and all its connected armatures rotate between each set of poleface; current is generated in each armature and is also available at the output.",
        "Unlike the prior art device with its single armature, it is the object of this invention to produce an electric generator having any required number of armature rotating on a single shaft as a unit.",
        "Another object of this invention is to provide an electric generator, so configured to supply electricity to all form of electric powered transportation.",
        "Still another object of this invention is to provide an electric generator which can be constructed to meet the need of Residential, Commercial, and Industrial consumer.",
        "Preferably, the endframes and polefaces are substantially the same size. Preferably, the endframes and polefaces are substantially circular and situated substantially in the same plane. Preferably, the support struts are substantially curve to the contour of both the endframes and polefaces.",
        "Preferably, the duct section of the armature shaft is substantially square.",
