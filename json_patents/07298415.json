    "abstract": "The present invention integrates a structured light source into an imaging system for reconstructing surface topography of an object being imaged. The structured light source includes a mechanism for transmitting a set of lines onto the object from an angle. The lines are displaced, or phase shifted relative to a stage, when they encounter an object with finite height, such as a mouse. This phase shift provides structured light information for the object. A camera captures the structured light information. Using software that employs a structured light analysis, surface topography data for the object is determined from the phase shift of the lines.",

In one example, the object is a small animal such as a mouse and the light source includes tumor cells labeled with light emitting reporters such as firefly luciferase or fluorescent proteins or dyes. This technology is known as in vivo optical imaging.",
        "Tomographic reconstruction in in vivo imaging builds a three-dimensional representation of the internal light source inside the surface of the object. Some tomographic reconstruction techniques rely on a three-dimensional representation of the object surface. Imaging small animals such as a mouse may require a new surface representation for each animal and each time the animal is imaged.",

        "In one aspect, the present invention relates to an imaging system for providing a three-dimensional surface representation of an animal. The imaging system comprises an imaging chamber including a set of walls enclosing an interior cavity and including a camera mount configured to position a camera. The imaging system also comprises a stage configured to support the animal within the interior cavity and within a field of view for the camera. The imaging system further comprises a structured light source configured to produce structured light for transmission onto the animal while the animal rests on the stage.

In other instances well known processes, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present invention.",
        "The present invention relates to imaging systems that comprise a structured light source, which produces structured light for transmission onto an object, such as a small animal. Structured light uses a set of lines of light. In one embodiment, the set of lines is projected down on an object at an angle (at about 30 degrees, for example) to the surface normal. The object generates structured light surface information as each light line reacts to the shape of the animal. Cumulatively, the lines of light each bend or alter in spacing as they pass over the object (FIG. 6C). The structured light surface information can be measured and used to determine the height of the surface at all locations that are illuminated by the structured light source.",
        "A camera captures the structured light surface information, digitizes the information and produces one or more structure light images. A processor produces a three-dimensional surface representation of the object\u2014or a portion of the object facing the camera\u2014using the structured light information. More specifically, a processing system, running on stored instructions for generating a topographic representation (a surface map) from the structured light surface information, builds a 3D topographic representation of the object using the structured light surface information. Various reconstruction techniques may be stored in software and used to build a 3D topographic representation. In one embodiment, the surface topography reconstruction produces a surface mesh.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates the projection of structured light onto an object and the generation of structured light surface information. A light source of the present invention transmits light onto an object 402 in one or more lines 404 at an angle, \u03b8. Since the projection angle is known, horizontal displacement for each line 404 is related to the height of object 402. More specifically, the height of object 402 where it intercepts each line 404 generates structured light information for each line 404 according to the horizontal displacement caused on the incoming light. By transmitting a grid of lines 404 of known dimensions onto the facing surface of object 402, a map of the facing surface topography may be obtained by quantitatively assessing horizontal bends in the captured light. FIG. 6C illustrates bends in a grid of lines cast onto a mouse sample. The structured light surface information then includes differences between the known spacing for the transmitted array of lines without any interference and the observed pattern captured by the camera. Although the present invention will be described with respect to horizontal differences in the structured light for a horizontal surface normal, it is understood that other systems may transmit structured light from other angles that produce structured light information in another direction (e.g., a vertical surface normal or any angle between a horizontal surface normal and vertical surface normal).",
        "The angle of incidence relative to the surface normal may vary. In one embodiment, an angle from about 15\u00b0 to about 30\u00b0 is suitable. Angles greater or less than this range may also be used. Preferably, the projection angle is large enough to get sufficient \u201cbend\u201d in the lines to achieve spatial resolution, but small enough that large shadows are not present.",
        "Light output by a structured light source of the present invention may vary. In general, the light output may include any lines or shapes suitable for generating structured light surface information that is useful in building a surface topography. In one embodiment, a structured light source transmits a grid of lines onto the animal. Line spacing between line in a parallel grid may be adapted to a specific object or image. A structured light source producing a parallel grid of lines having a line spacing in the range of about 0.5 to about 2 lines per mm is suitable for a mouse. Other line spacings are suitable for use with the present invention. Closer line spacing provides higher resolution, but the lines may be more difficult to track on rough surfaces such as fur. The line spacing may also vary based on the object surface texture and object size.",
        "The present invention may use any suitable structured light generating system. In one embodiment, a structured light source used in an imaging system includes a projector that projects a grid of lines 404. In another embodiment, a structured light source includes a laser operatively cooperating with a pair of actuated mirrors that rapidly move a single light beam to form the set of lines across the object 402. Another suitable structured light projector comprises a laser device that employs diffraction patterns to achieve a desired structured light pattern. Other structured light sources may be used with the present invention.",
        "FIG. 2A illustrates a structured light source comprising a scanning laser galvanometer 420 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Scanning laser galvanometer 420 comprises a laser 422 and a pair of mirrors 424 and 426.",
        "Laser 422 generates light. Laser 422 is positioned such that output of its linear laser beam transmits onto mirror 424. Laser 422 may include any suitable laser, such as a diode laser or a diode pumped solid-state laser. Any color is also suitable for use with laser 422. Common commercially available laser colors include red, green and blue. In a specific embodiment, laser 422 comprises a green diode pumped solid-state laser, such as one available from a wide variety of commercial vendors.",
        "Mirrors 424 and 426 each direct light provided by laser 422. As shown, mirror 424 first receives light provided by laser 422 and reflects the light towards mirror 426, which reflects the light into an imaging chamber. The two mirrors cooperate to permit two degrees of freedom for positioning a light beam provided by laser 422. A maximum transmission field 428 defines the spatial range for direction of light by mirrors 424 and 426. Mirrors 424 and 426 may create any line, shape, grid or pattern of light within field 428. For example, the actuators and mirrors 424 may form a set of parallel lines normal to the head to toe facing of a mouse (for any position of the mouse). In one embodiment, mirrors 424 and 426 receive position control from a computer that determines a specific light pattern output by scanning laser galvanometer 420.",
        "Actuators 430 and 432 position mirrors 424 and 426, respectively. Each actuator 430 and 432 may comprise any suitable mechanical actuation responsive to electrical input. For example, motors are suitable for use with actuators 430 and 432. In another specific example, magnetic actuation is suitable for use with actuators 430 and 432. Magnetic actuation provides accurate and rapid response. For galvanometer 420, the actuators operate at a high enough speed such that a single beam of light produced by laser 422 may generate a set of lines. In this case, the mirrors move fast enough such that the laser point sweeps across the surface of the animal quickly enough to register lines as detected by a camera.

Grids of more or less lines are also suitable, as are other scan rates.",
        "In one embodiment, scanning laser galvanometer 420 is custom-designed for use in an imaging chamber of the present invention. In another embodiment, scanning laser galvanometer 420 comprises a commercially available model. One exemplary scanning laser galvanometer system suitable for use with the present invention is a model 6200H galvanometer scanner and a 67120-0627 MicroMax Model 671XX Servo Driver and Controller as provided by Cambridge Instruments of Cambridge, Mass.",
        "Computer control of mirrors 424 and 426 for scanning laser galvanometer 420 also permits custom light output for a structured light source. For example, this permits line spacing to be altered and finely controlled. In this case, computer control may allow a user to increase the density of line spacing and increase the amount of structured light surface information, which results in a more detailed topographic representation. Computer control also permits control of structured light patterns to improve the quality of structured light surface information for an animal. For example, computer-control permits the line spacing to vary to accommodate variations in animal size and fur color or texture for an animal. Computer control also permits control of structured light patterns to adapt for a particular field of view used in imaging or orientation of the animal.",
        "Independent control of each mirror 424 and 426 also permits a user to steer the light to different locations within the imaging chamber. This is useful when a user places an animal or object in an off-center position. In addition, this is useful when multiple animals are imaged within an imaging box.",
        "The projected light pattern produced by scanning laser galvanometer 420 may also be used for other purposes. For example, the projected pattern may be used to generate an alignment target for positioning an object or animal within the imaging chamber. In this case, scanning laser galvanometer 420 creates crosshairs or another suitable alignment target for positioning an animal on a stage or floor of the imaging chamber. The light output may also indicate the field of view for the camera.",
        "In addition, scanning laser galvanometer 420 may be used for automated focusing techniques. More specifically, displacement of grid lines on the top surface of a mouse may indicate how tall the mouse is. Since each mouse may be a different height, this provides an automated focus system for the imaging system that permits the camera to adaptively focus to a specific height for each individual mouse.",
        "Since mirrors 424 and 426 permit flexible re-direction and transmission of light, scanning laser galvanometer 420 may be flexibly located in an imaging chamber. In one embodiment, scanning laser galvanometer 420 is disposed at the top of an imaging chamber and reflects the laser beam of light down onto a top surface of the animal. When galvanometer 420 is disposed outside a top wall 423 (or sub-wall) of the imaging chamber (see FIG. 2B), the top wall includes a small hole 421 that permits light from the second mirror to pass through and into the imaging chamber. Proximity between the second mirror and wall 423 reduces size of hole 421, since any structured light pattern or other pattern splaying at some projection angle has not had significant distance to enlarge.",

In a specific embodiment, movable stage 58 has a threaded bore that is operably engaged with a worm gear 164 that provides vertical translation of the moveable stage 58. A motor drives the worm gear to move the stage 58 up and down along a pair of guides 140. In another embodiment, the stage 58 is driven vertically using a belt driven system that provides a faster response than the worm gear. A temperature control element 132 is provided by a heating blanket placed on top of stage 58 for controlling the temperature of a mammal placed on stage 58.

Diffuser 173 reduces spatial variance in the intensity of light across its surface area to produce light flux at its output surface that has a more even light intensity distribution across the flux area. LEDs 172 and diffuser 173 cumulatively provide light of a desired flux with substantially equal intensity distribution.",
        "Condenser receives light from diffuser 173, condenses the divergent light flux from LEDs 172 and transmits the light onto mask 175. Mask 175 includes a number of apertures that selectively permit the passage of light therethrough. As shown, mask 175 includes a series of parallel lines that form a parallel line grid. The spacing and number of lines may vary as described above. Other patterns may be formed by mask 175 other than parallel lines.

Generally, the present invention may be applied with any non-invasive methods and compositions for detecting, localizing and tracking light-emitting entities and biological events in a mammalian subject. For example, the imaging system 10 may be implemented with intensified Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) cameras to detect the localization of light-producing cells (e.g., certain bacteria or tumor cells made bioluminescent by transforming them with luciferase DNA constructs) inside of living animals, such as mice. In such applications, an animal containing the bioluminescent cells is placed inside of box 12 and on stage 204. Camera 20 is then activated to detect the emitted photons. The photon signal may then be used to construct a luminescent image of photon emission. The luminescent image is constructed without using light sources other than the luminescence from the object itself. This luminescence is recorded as a function of position to produce the luminescence image. The photographic image may also be taken of the same object to aid in position visualization of the luminescent image. One approach to generating such composite photographic/luminescence images is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,650,135 issued to Contag et al. on Jul. 22, 1997.

Process flow 500 begins by placing an object such as an animal to be imaged for light emission on stage 204 within imaging box 12 (202). Using computer 28, a user inputs a desired position for stage 204. Based on the input, transport mechanism 202 moves stage 204 to the corresponding position according to a control signal provided by computer 28 (504). Light transmission device 111 also re-positions according to a control signal provided by computer 28.",

Preparation may include launching imaging and acquisition software (e.g., \u201cLivingImage\u201d as provided by Xenogen Corporation of Alameda, Calif.) on the computer 28 and initializing camera 20. Further preparations may include closing door 18, activating the photographic capture option in the software, focusing camera 20 to a specific depth of the object or animal, and turning on the lights in box 12. Preparations may also include focusing lens 100, selectively positioning an appropriate lens filter 118, setting the f-stop, etc. A photographic image is then captured (508). Upon completion of photographic capture, the photographic image data is transferred to an image processing unit 26 and/or a processor in computer system 28.

The luminescence image data are transferred to the image processing unit 26 and/or a processor in computer 28 (516).",
        "At this point, a user may manipulate and store the luminescence image data as well as process it for display on the computer display 38. The manipulation may also include overlaying the luminescent image with the photographic image and displaying the two images together as a 2-D \u201coverlay\u201d image, with the luminescence data typically shown in pseudocolor to show intensity. This overlay image may then be the basis for user analysis and may be analyzed and manipulated as desired. In particular, an analysis may include a summation of the illumination magnitudes over the pixels within a portion of the luminescence representation. Note that although the discussion will focus on a single luminescence representation for the overlay image, the process flow 500 may include taking multiple luminescence representations from the same position of stage 204, e.g., at the same time or a later time (518).",

Image collection may further continue by capturing images of the object from alternate positions and views of the sample.",

Together, a structured light photographic representation of the object and a luminescence representation of the object may be combined to form a structured light superposition or overlay image. Because the imaging apparatus 100 is typically used to measure the entire object 106, the data in the luminescence representation typically has one or more distinct luminescent portions of interest.",
        "An image of the structured light is taken with camera 20. After the 2-D structured light images have been captured and stored, computer 28 may then process the structured light data to generate a surface topography (522). As one of skill in the art will appreciate, there are numerous conventional algorithms for reconstructing a surface from structured light images. For example, the phase shift of each line at all points on the image can be determined from a computationally-efficient 2D Fourier transform. The actual surface height is then computed by \u201cunwrapping\u201d the phase map.",

In one embodiment, the present invention builds a surface topography of the animal for a surface that faces the camera only. In another embodiment, the present invention builds a surface topography of the animal for a large surface of the animal that is greater than just the surface facing the camera. In this case, imaging apparatus 10 captures a sequence of images from multiple positions. This sequence of images is taken at different viewing angles and provides the information necessary to stitch together multiple surface topography portions (see FIGS. 7A-7C).",
        "The surface topography may then be used to reconstruct the location, brightness, and size of a light source within the animal. One suitable reconstruction algorithm (or inversion algorithm) suitable for use with the present invention is diffuse optical tomography.

        "Process flow 530 begins by imaging a structured light reference to produce a pattern without the sample (531 and FIG. 6B). This may be performed by applying structured light to a stage or surface that the sample rests upon before the sample is imaged. During image capture of the sample, the stage is moved to common locations as those used in image capture without the sample.",
        "Subsequently when the sample is in the imaging chamber, the sample is imaged with structured light (532 and FIG. 6C). Structured light uses a series of lines of light that are projected down on a sample at an angle to the surface normal. The lines bend as they pass over the sample, and the bend in the lines can be used to determine the height of the surface at all locations that are illuminated by a structured light projector. The projection angle is large enough to get sufficient \u201cbend\u201d in the lines to achieve spatial resolution, but small enough that large shadows are not present.",
        "Process flow 530 then proceeds by imaging the sample without structured light (533 and FIG. 6D). The phase shift of each line at all points on the background and sample may be determined from a 2D Fourier transform.",
        "The background data is then converted to a wrapped phase (534 and FIG. 6E). Here, the background data is Fourier transformed and filtered before a wrapped phase is calculated. Similarly, the sample data is converted to a wrapped phase (535 and FIG. 6F) by Fourier transforming and filtering the sample data, and the calculating a wrapped phase for the sample data.",
        "Surface topography for the sample is then calculated (536 and FIG. 6G). In this case, this is performed by \u201cunwrapping\u201d the phase map. Several unwrapping algorithms are available to those of skill in the art for this task. For example, the phase shift of each line at all points on the image can be determined from using Fourier profilometry techniques. With these methods, a 2D Fast-Fourier transform (FFT) of the fringe data (FIG. 6D) is taken to determine the phase shift of the lines everywhere in the image (FIG. 6F). Since the phase will shift by many multiples of 2\u03c0 for a typical object, the phase exhibits 2\u03c0 jumps as seen in FIG. 6F. These phase jumps are \u201cunwrapped\u201d in order to determine the actual surface.",
        "The above processes (531-536) may then be repeated (537) from different views and positions. Imaging a sample from multiple views provides additional information that helps techniques described herein provide a more accurate 3D surface rendering. The multiple images, or the partial surfaces obtained from each view in the 3D imaging system, are then registered together to form a complete 3D surface (538 and FIG. 6H). Registering can be accomplished by using non-linear least squares fitting techniques to minimize the distance between mesh elements on two surfaces that are to be connected. Typically, the surfaces should have a starting orientation that is fairly close to the final registered position. In other words, only fine adjustments to the surface positions may be accommodated with this method. Another registration technique is to provide an absolute reference line or fiducial of some kind in the image, which gives the absolute position of any partial surface with respect to the stage, for example. If the absolute positioning of each surface is accurate enough, then the non-linear fitting method described above can be skipped.",
        "The surface topography derived from structured light data has many uses. Some users may employ the surface topography to provide a pictorial view of the object surface. The surface topography may also be used in tomographic reconstruction of an internal light source. In this case, using a) one or more luminescent images that relate to a light source internal to the object and b) the orientation of the surface topography or a surface mesh built with the surface topography, photon density just below the surface can be determined. The photon density just below the surface is related to the light intensity emitted from the surface and captured in the luminescent images. A set of volume elements can be constructed in the volume interior to the surface. The source strength in each volume element may then be determined using the photon density just below the surface. Further description of one suitable system for tomographic reconstruction is described in commonly owned pending patent application Ser. No. 10/606,976 and entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for 3D Imaging of Internal Light Sources\u201d, which was incorporated by reference above.",
        "Thus, the processing hardware and software may also be applied to perform tomographic reconstruction and various image processing functions described herein. For example, the processor may be configured to produce a 3D structured light representation using structured light information included in images taken from one or more positions of the stage in the interior cavity. In one embodiment, imaging system 10 employs a quantitative model that estimates the diffusion of photons in tissue. In one embodiment, the model processes in vivo image data and in order to spatially resolve a 3D representation of the size, shape, and location of the light emitting source. Typically, a tomographic model is stored as instructions in memory of processing system 28. Various diffusion and reconstruction models may be implemented by system 10 to represent photon propagation through a mammalian subject or a phantom device described herein. One suitable tomographic example of software that builds a digital representation of a light source internal to a mammalian sample or phantom device using data from one or more images is described in commonly owned and pending patent application Ser. No. 10/606,976 entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for 3D Imaging of Internal Light Sources\u201d and naming Brad Rice et al. as inventors. This application is incorporated by reference herein and its entirety for all purposes.",
        "Although structured light generation has been described with respect to structured light sources and methods described above, the present invention also relates to machine-readable media that include program instructions, state information, etc. for performing structured light operations described herein. Examples of machine-readable media include, but are not limited to, magnetic media such as hard disks, floppy disks, and magnetic tape; optical media such as CD-ROM disks; magneto-optical media such as floptical disks; and hardware devices that are specially configured to store and perform program instructions, such as read-only memory devices (ROM) and random access memory (RAM). A processor as described above may then be configured to run from the stored instructions and perform many of the methods described above (e.g., process flow 530). Examples of program instructions include both machine code, such as produced by a compiler, and files containing higher level code that may be executed by the computer using an interpreter.",
        "In one embodiment, the present invention builds a surface topography of the animal for a large surface of the animal that is greater than just the surface facing the camera. In this case, imaging apparatus 10 captures a sequence of images from multiple positions. This sequence of images is taken at different viewing angles and provides the information necessary to stitch together multiple surface topography portions. Each structured light image provides the surface topology for approximately the facing half of the animal only. By taking images from several viewing angles, e.g., about every 45 degrees, the entire 3D surface of the animal can be reconstructed by \u201cstitching\u201d together the partial surface reconstructions obtained from each view. FIGS. 7A-C illustrate one system suitable for obtaining a sequence of structured light images from multiple viewing angles.",
        "FIG. 7A is a top perspective view of internal components in an imaging box with the exterior walls removed showing stage 204 directly below a fixed datum 107. FIG. 7B is a top perspective view of the components in box 12 with the exterior walls removed showing stage 204 below and off-center from fixed datum 107. FIG. 7C is a top perspective view of the components in box 12 with the exterior walls removed showing stage 204 above and off center from fixed datum 107.",
        "As shown in FIG. 7C, a camera mount 109 is attached to side housing 16 of side wall 103b. Camera mount 109 is adapted to receive and position camera 20 relative to fixed datum 107 for viewing of object 106 within cavity 44 by camera 20. While camera 20 is capable of capturing photographic and structured light images, it is also sensitive enough to capture luminescence images thereof.",
        "A moveable stage apparatus 200 is disposed in interior cavity 44, and includes a transport mechanism 202 and a stage 204 to support the light-emitting object 106. Moveable stage apparatus 200 is capable of two degrees of freedom movement to reposition the stage 204 (and object 106) to a plurality of positions within interior cavity 44. Any one position therebetween may be retained for image capture.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 7A-C, the transport mechanism 202 in the embodiment comprises two linear actuators 206 and 208 oriented at substantially perpendicular to one another. Each linear actuator 206 and 208 is capable of positioning stage 204 linearly along the respective actuator. Linear actuator 206 provides vertical positioning for stage 204 while linear actuator 208 provides horizontal positioning for stage 204. Linear actuator 206 has a stationary portion attached to box 12 and a mobile portion attached to linear actuator 208. Linear actuator 208 has a relatively stationary portion attached to linear actuator 206 and a mobile portion attached to stage 204. An example of one such linear actuator suitable for use in the transport mechanism 202 is a LC-33 produced by Thomson Industries of Port Washington, N.Y.",
        "The transport mechanism 202 preferably includes a set of position sensors that are operably coupled to the computer 28 to provide position feedback to control the position of stage 204. Linear actuators 206 and 208, position sensors 212, and computer 28 combine to provide closed loop position control for stage 204 within interior cavity 44. More specifically, a user, via computer 28, may input one or more positions for stage 204 along a substantially circular path about fixed datum 107. In one embodiment, a user provides a viewing angle for stage 204 relative to fixed datum 107. Software included in computer 28 then converts the viewing angle into control signals for moving each of the linear actuators 206 and 208.",
        "Light transmission device 111 directs light reflected or emitted from object 106 along the direction of fixed datum 107 and into lens 100 for image capture by camera 20. Light transmission device 111 is mounted to housing 16 using stationary bracket 119 (FIG. 7A), which includes circumferentially disposed bearings between stationary bracket 119 and moving bracket 126 that allow turning mirror assembly 120 to rotate freely relative to stationary bracket 119. Mirror assembly 120 is thus rotably coupled to housing 16 and rotates about an axis co-axially aligned with the stationary axis of the fixed datum 107.",
        "Referring to FIG. 7C, mirror assembly 120 comprises an angled mirror 121 that reflects light from object 106 on stage 204 in a direction along fixed datum 107. Outer wall 123 is substantially cylindrical and includes aperture 122 that enables light to pass between stage 204 and turning mirror 121. Outer wall 123 of mirror assembly 120 also prevents residual light in interior cavity 44 not directly associated with the current viewing angle of stage 204 from reaching lens 100. This is partially performed by configuring mirror 121 to be sufficiently long to span the length of stage 204. As the stage is positioned along the circular path about the stationary axis, outer wall 123 and turning mirror 121 cooperate to collect light primarily from the angular direction of stage 204 which is then reflected along fixed datum 107 for reception by lens 100.",
        "FIG. 7D illustrates a simplified view of light transmission within box 12 using light transmission device 111. FIG. 7D also show another configuration for a structured light projector 170. As shown, structured light 175, emitted from structured light projector 170, reflects off a mirror 173, passes through partially transparent mirror 121, and onto object 106. In one embodiment, the partial transparence of mirror 121 is achieved using a half-silvered or partially silvered mirror. In another embodiment, a dichroic mirror having wavelength specific transparency properties is used. The structured light 175 may then be captured by camera 20.",
        "The two degrees of freedom movement provided by transport mechanism 202 allow stage 204 and object 106 to be positioned at multiple angles relative to fixed datum 107 for image capture by camera 20. Thus, based on user input via computer 28, transport mechanism 202 and light transmission device 111 cooperate to direct light from object 106 on stage 204 to fixed datum 107 and lens 100 to capture image using camera 20. In addition to providing full 360 degree angular viewing of object 106 about the circular path, transport mechanism 202 is capable of varying the image depth for a given angle of stage 204 relative to fixed datum 107. Together, transport mechanism 202 and light transmission device 111 cooperate to provide a field of view for camera 20 in the range of about 7.5 cm to about 16.5 cm. In a specific embodiment, light transmission device 111 cooperate to provide a field of view for camera 20 in the range of about 13 cm to about 16.5 cm. Similar to the user initiated angular position control described above, a user may input a desired focal depth and viewing angle for stage 204. Software included in computer 28 and linear actuators 206 and 208 would then combine to position stage 204 at the desired angle and depth relative to fixed datum 107.",
        "As the term is used herein, a stage refers to a structure used to support an object during image capture. Flat surfaces are well suited for use, such as a fixed flat bottom panel in the imaging box (a stationary stage). In another embodiment, the stage is moveable. One suitable vertical posistionable stage was discussed above. In general, the present invention is not limited to any particular stage structure or configuration.",
        "Some stages may include transparent portions to permit image capture through the stage. For example, the transport mechanism 202 described above relies on some transparency in the stage.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 8A and 8B, stage 204 comprises a frame 252 and a transparent portion 254. Transparent portion 254 allows light emitted or reflected from object 106 to be transmitted therethrough with substantially no interference and minimal distortion for any position of stage 204 about fixed datum 107. Transparent portion 254 preferably, comprises a transparent wire array 256 that supports object 106. In a specific embodiment, transparent wire array 256 is a single transparent nylon line interwoven through holes 258 on opposing edges of frame 252 and secured in a taut manner to support object 106. In another embodiment, array 256 is a mesh that resembles a cross pattern grid similar to a tennis racket mesh.",
        "In a specific embodiment, stage 204 includes hardware based crash protection measures that prevent undesirable contact between stage 204 and other components within box 12. In a specific embodiment, crash pin 250 is placed on the side of stage 204 closest to the camera 20, as shown in FIG. 8A. Crash pin 250 prevents contact between stage 204 and components within cavity 44. To prevent contact between stage 204 and light transmission device 111, camera 20 or wall 103b, a metal ring 260 is perimetrically disposed around light transmission device 111 on stationary bracket 119.",
        "Although various details have been omitted for brevity's sake, obvious design alternatives may be implemented. For example, although the present invention has been discussed primarily in the context of a structured light source useful for in-vivo imaging applications, the present invention is suitable for other imaging applications and may be tailored correspondingly. Therefore, the present examples are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive, and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims."
