The fourth curved part 1015 forms a bend from which the strips extend in a fifth part 1017, wherein the fifth part 1017 forms a coiled sub-part 1018 encircling the second axis B-B. Preferably, the lengths of the fifth part 1017 of the different strips 1006, 1007, 1008 are slightly different to enable forming of the coiled sub-part 1018, since the different strips 1006, 1007, 1008 will have slightly different curvature at the coiled sub-part 1018. The strips 1006, 1007, 1008 are further provided with a sixth curved part 1019 forming a bend from which the strips 1006, 1007, 1008 extend in a seventh part 1021 in a direction essentially parallel to the second axis B-B. The seventh part 1021 of the strips connects to the second connection means 1005, wherein the second and third strips are connected via the intermediate parts (not shown).",
        "The flexible connector 1001 is arranged to lead through the two-axis hinge, the first connection means 1003 is attached to the first circuitry, and the first part 1009 of the pack of strips 1006, 1007, 1008 extends into the hinge and is coiled 1010 around the first axis A-A to be able to take up movements caused when the members of the communication apparatus are pivoted around the first axis A-A. Similarily, the fifth part 1017 is coiled 1018 around the second axis B-B to take up movements caused when the members of the communication apparatus are pivoted around the second axis B-B. The seventh part 1021 of the pack of strips 1006, 1007, 1008 extends from the coiled part 1018, formed by the third part 1021 of the pack of strips 1006, 1007, 1008, towards the second connection means 1005, which is attached to the second circuitry.",
        "Thus, mechanical stress of the flexible connector is minimized as the communication apparatus is folded, unfolded, and pivoted a great number of times around axes A-A and B-B. Therefore, a reliable connection is provided between the circuitry of the members of the communication apparatus.",
        "The preferred embodiment has three strips, but it is also possible to provide a flexible connector with one strip, as shown in FIG. 4. Further, it is possible to provide a flexible connector with 2, 4, 5 or more strips.",
        "When the flexible connector is provided with two or more strips, wherein each strip has essentially the same shape, as described for the three strip embodiment above, the flexible connector is provided with intermediate parts between each strip, each intermediate part having a first and a second dividing line. The first and second dividing lines are parallel to enable parallel displacement of the strips, analogous to the preferred embodiment. Preferably, the lengths of the first part of the different strips are slightly different to enable forming of the coiled sub-part, since the different strips will have slightly different curvature at the coiled sub-part. Preferably, the lengths of the fifth part of the different strips are slightly different to enable forming of the coiled sub-part, since the different strips will have slightly different curvature at the coiled sub-part. The different strips have preferably the same width, e.g. 8 mm. Alternatively, the different strips have different widths."
