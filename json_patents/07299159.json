Referring to FIG. 1a, health monitoring system 100 includes a processing unit 101 which may be attached to, for example, a person's upper arm. Typically, processing unit 101 is of similar construction and operation to a lightweight Holter type device, with certain modifications according to embodiments of the invention, but may be of other configurations.",
        "The air pressure arm cuff could be the blood pressure arm cuff. By attaching the processing unit 101 to The Blood pressure arm cuff 102 a very efficient health monitor system is provided. This system can even include an integration of a processing unit 101 to additional sensors that are connected to the blood pressure arm cuff 102, thus providing a health monitor system that can be worn or removed very quickly, and does not require wires of wireless connections between a processing unit and sensors, thus reducing the cost of such a system, increasing its reliability and making it more easy to wear. This blood pressure upper arm cuff device could be also blood pressure holter for 24 hours or more. This device could be programmed via processing unit 101, via Personal computer, Cellular phone or PDA.",
        "Processing unit 101 may be mounted on or otherwise attached to other sensors, transceivers or devices and can be embedded within other devices. The processing unit 101 is connected, to one or more physiological data sensors. Conveniently, the processing unit 101 can be attached to an air pressure arm cuff 102, which provides typically automatic measuring of blood pressure values. In one embodiment, air pressure arm cuff 102 includes pressure sensor 109, measuring the air pressure in the arm cuff 102. Additional physiological data may be corrected. Typically, processing unit 101 stores, inter alia, a series of blood pressure values signed by time; other data formats may be used and other data may be stored. Processing unit 101 need not be attached to pressure cuff 102.",
        "Processing unit 101 may be connected to, for example, at least one biophysical data sensor such as accelerometer sensor 103, typically attached to the person's wrist or lower arm, an attitude sensor 104, typically attached to the person's chest or torso, and a foot step or ground contact sensor 105, typically located at a persons foot, typically on the insole. These biophysical data sensors provide an indication about physical activity of the person.",

        "The accelerometer sensor 103 may be used (when placed on one position on the person's body) as a hand motion sensor, detecting particular hand moving patterns. The attitude sensor 104 may provide attitude sensing, measuring acceleration or other physical properties of the person's body (e.g., position, orientation) in, typically, three orthogonal axes. Data produced by attitude sensor 104 may allow for calculation or determination of the person's body attitude, position, or orientation, for example relative to vertical axis. In one embodiment, the foot step sensor 105 includes a strain gage sensing insole placed into the person's shoe, used to monitor the pressure of the foot; other configurations are possible.",
        "FIG. 1B depicts a monitoring system using bi-directional wireless connections according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 1B, system 100 includes, for example, a processing unit 101, an arm cuff 102, an accelerometer sensor 103, an attitude sensor 104, a ground contact sensor 105, and electrodes 106 attached to the person chest. Certain of the units 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 and possibly 106 may be connected using a wireless connection. In one embodiment, each of units 103, 104 and 105 include a transmitter 107a, which typically uses known Bluetooth\u2122 standard technology to transmit the data output by such units to a receiver 107b, located in processing unit 101. Typically, since processing unit 101 is mounted on or adjacent to arm cuff 102, units 101 and 102 need not communicate wirelessly. If processing unit 101 and arm cuff 102 are otherwise located, data may be communicated between them wirelessly. Receiver 107b typically uses known Bluetooth\u2122 standard technology to receive data output by the various physiological monitoring units.",
        "The wireless connections can be utilized for conveying instructions to initiate a measurement when one of the sensors detected that an event occurs (for example raise of blood pressure or heart rate above a certain threshold), or in a periodical manner.",
        "Synchronization between multiple measurements can provide vital information to the person or to a doctor. By analyzing physiological data gathered from various sensors the monitoring system can determine if an event occurred, if there is a need to ask person to initiate additional measurements and/or if to transmit the data to a remote system, whether to generate an alarm signal to the person, and the like. The alarm signal can also include a request to call a certain number (for example of a remote medical center, of a doctor and the like), and can also instruct the person to perform certain acts (for example- to rest, drink, take a drug and the like).",
        "FIG. 2 is a block diagram of various components of the monitoring system 100, according to one embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2, an inflatable arm cuff 102 is connected via tubing or piping 202 to a pressure sensor 109, a cuff-pressure regulator valve 204, and an air pump 205. Other known devices and systems for blood pressure monitoring may be used, having different configuration and functionality. In the system depicted in FIG. 2, data may be transferred wirelessly, in one embodiment using the Bluetooth\u2122 standard. In alternate embodiments, other wireless standards and equipment may be used.",
        "The processing unit 101 includes a band-pass filter 206, a processor such as micro-controller 209, a low-pass filter 207, a low pass filter 221, and one or more ECG amplifiers 218. The micro-controller 209 typically includes a built-in A/D converter (not shown), a read only memory (ROM, not shown) and random access memory (RAM, not shown).",
        "In alternate embodiments such components may be external to the micro-controller 209. The micro-controller 209 may communicate with other devices such as a memory (typically a flash memory) 210, audio amplifier 211, speaker 212, for transmission via phone network (e.g., PSTN), infrared (IR) transceiver 213, a wireless transceiver 214 using, for example the Bluetooth\u2122 standard, and an antenna 215. Other sets of components and other combinations of components may be used. The micro-controller 209 typically processes input signals according to, for example, the control programs stored in a ROM or other memory contained within or connected to micro-controller 209 by, for example, utilizing the temporary-storage function of the RAM, and may produce a drive or control signal to control components of the processing unit 101 to, for example, perform tests. Processing unit 101 may, for example, be connected to a motor 208 and valve 204 for controlling cuff 102. The battery power supply 224 supplies required voltages for components of the processing unit 101. Storage methods other than a flash memory may be used.",
        "On receipt by processing unit 101, the output signal of the pressure sensor 109 (and possibly other received signals) may be processed locally, in processing unit 101. Alternately, such signals may be processed on a remote device, for example at a doctor's office. For example, the of the pressure sensor 109 signal may be input to band-pass filter 206, which selectively transmits a heartbeat-synchronous oscillatory component of the received pressure signal as a pulse wave signal, \u201cPWS,\u201d to an analog input AN4 of micro-controller 209. The pulse wave signal PWS typically represents the pulse wave produced from the pressed arteries of the subject's arm, propagated to the inflatable arm cuff 102 providing pressure on the arm. The pressure signal of the pressure sensor 109 may also be input to, for example, a low-pass filter 207, which may selectively transmit a static component of the received signal, as a cuff pressure signal, \u201cSPS,\u201d to the analog input AN3 of micro-controller 209. In one embodiment, the cuff pressure signal SPS represents the change of static pressure within the inflatable arm cuff 102. Other methods and devices for processing the output of the pressure sensor may be used, and, in alternate embodiments no processing need be performed by the local unit worn on the person.",
        "To measure blood pressure, the micro-controller 209 may, for example, send drive signals to the motor driver 208 of air pump 205 to inflate the cuff 102 and thereby press the upper arm, and may feed drive signals to the cuff-pressure regulator valve 204 to gradually reduce the cuff pressure of the cuff 102. The micro-controller 209 receives, during the reduction of the cuff pressure, the pulse wave signal PWS and the cuff pressure signal \u201cCPS\u201d from the pressure sensor 109 via the respective filters 206, 207. The micro-controller 209 determines, based on the received signals PWS and CPS, the systolic (SAP) and diastolic (DAP) blood pressure values of the subject [Inventor: the following isn't clear\u2014do you mean \u201cusing\u201d instead of \u201cin\u201d?] in the known oscillometric blood pressure measuring process, respectively. The micro-controller 209 collects the SAP and DAP values in, for example, a blood-pressure (BP) memory areas of a flesh memory 210. In one embodiment, the arm cuff 102, air pump 205, pressure sensor 109, filters 206 and 207, and micro-controller 209 cooperate with each other to provide a blood pressure Holter.",
        "Processing unit 101 can at the same time function as, for example, an ECG three-channel Holter. ECG signals capture by electrodes 106 may be input to the ECG amplifiers 218. Analog ECG signals from the amplifiers 218 are transferred to the analog inputs of the built-in A/D converter of the micro-controller 209. Samples of the ECG signal may be collected in the flesh memory 209. Other numbers of signals, other sets of signals, and other types of signals, may be captured.",
        "The processing unit 101 can be connected to additional sensors, such as but not limited to those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,366,871 of Geva. According to an embodiment of the micro-controller 209 is capable of receiving inputs from one or more physiological sensor and in response initiate a measurement of another physiological sensor. Micro-controller 209 can also initiate multiple measurements according to a predefined schedule.",
        "According to an embodiment of the invention if a certain measurement requires human intervention, the processing unit 101 can generate a vocal request to the person to assist in said measurement.",
        "Data from foot step sensor 105 (which is typically placed in a person's shoe) may be used, for example, for monitoring a person's daily activity. FIGS. 3a and 3b illustrate two embodiments of possible construction of foot step sensor 105. Other embodiments are possible. Other types of foot or step sensors may be used, not placed inside a shoe or on the foot.",
        "Referring to FIG. 3a, foot step sensor 105 includes, for example, strain gage transducer 302 and temperature compensated amplifier 303. The output voltage of amplifier 303 is transferred via a suitable connecting cable through low pass filter 221 (FIG. 2) to the analog input of the built-in A/D converter of micro-controller 209. The input data may be, for example, processed by a digital signal processing program in real time.",
        "FIG. 3a depicts a foot step sensor using wireless communication with processing unit 101. For example, Bluetooth\u2122 standard wireless technology may be used. The output signal of the foot step sensor may be transferred through low pass filter 221 (FIG. 2) to the analog input of the built-in A/D converter of micro-controller 209. The input data may be, for example, processed by digital signal processing program in real time and transmitted via, for example, a wireless modem to the processing unit 101.",
        "Certain embodiments of the invention may include a system and method for activity measurement such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,183,425 to Whalen and Breit, incorporated herein by reference. The 6,183,425 patent describes, inter alia, a system and method for quantifying daily activity in terms of daily history of the vertical component of the ground reaction force (GRFz). The device includes a sensor placed in a shoe which detects the contact of the foot with the ground. The time of occurrence of each significant foot-down and foot-up event may be recorded. Ground contact time may be identified as, for example, walking, running or \u201cspecial\u201d by the value of the contact-time interval and may reject a contact pair that falls outside of the known walking or running contact time to stride period relationship. The timing events may be, for example, converted to cyclic peaks of GRFz using appropriate walking and running regression equations. The system and method provide an \u201cactivity index,\u201d reflecting walking and running energy consumption. An embodiment of the present invention may use such methods to quantify the person body activity during normal daily activity.",
        "The data received from the sensing insole 105 is typically processed by a digital signal processing program, typically controlled by micro-controller 209.",
        "During processing, noise and spurious non-significant contacts, like foot tapping or not true gait cycles may be reduced. The signal may be compared to the high and low levels values to capture the primarily weight-bearing contacts. The times of foot contact to ground in pairs of foot-down and foot-up events may be collected sequentially, with other data, in memory 210. This raw data of the periods of contact cycles may be, for example, downloaded to a local computer or transferred to the remote station for farther processing.",
        "In one embodiment, the duration of the pulse at the output of the amplifier 221, or the minimum foot ground contact time during running which indicates a foot fall may be, for example, about 0.15 sec. Using a sampling rate of 250 samples per second (or 4 msec duration between samples), about minimum 37 samples per single pulse or foot fall is obtained. FIG. 4 illustrates the input and output data for a sample contact period tc detection algorithm using the high and low threshold values crossing technique. Other specific values may be used, and other algorithms or processing techniques may be used.",
        "The attitude sensor 104 may be implemented using, for example a Triaxial Digital Accelerometer Model 2420 from Silicon Designs, Inc. The Model 2420 contains three orthogonally mounted Model 1010 integrated accelerometers. The module produces three pulse train outputs. The outputs of the sensor 104 may be connected to the counter inputs T0, T1, T2 of the micro-controller 209 (FIG. 2).",
        "Referring now to FIG. 5 there is shown a coordinate set of axes X, Y and Z designating a person's body orientation with respect to the \u2018horizon\u2019 8 as reference plane, according to one embodiment of the present invention. Rotation motions may be defined within these planes and around these axes, such as \u2018pitch\u2019 (rotation about Y in XZ plane), \u2018roll\u2019 (rotation about X in YZ plane) and \u2018yaw\u2019 rotation about Z in XY plane). Triaxial acceleration monitoring using, for example, attitude sensor 104, may be used to provide a calculation of the center of gravity Ac orientation relative to the projection of this center Ap on the XY plane at a vertical position of the body and coordinate Z=0. The deviation of the person's body from a vertical position causes the changes of the output signals of the sensor 104. These signals may be sampled and, for example, stored in the memory 210 signed by the time for synchronizing with other simultaneously monitored parameters. Further processing of the stored data may provide detection of the person body orientation (e.g., rest, moving in a horizontal plane, moving in vertical plane, rapid or incidence fall, etc.). This information, in correlation with heart rate, blood pressure and other parameters may be used to perform a person health condition analysis during person daily exercising.",
        "The accelerometer sensor 103 may include, for example, a digital accelerometer Model 1010 from Silicon Designs, Inc. Accelerometer sensor 103 may be used for, for example, monitoring the motions of the person hand to which the inflatable arm cuff 102 is attached. Such an accelerometer may be attached at another body position, such as on the leg. The Model 1010 accelerometer produces a pulse train in which the density of pulses (number of pulses per second) is proportional to the applied acceleration. It combines in a single, miniature, hermetically sealed package a micromachined capacitive sense element and an integrated circuit that includes, for example, a sense amplifier and a sigma-delta A/D converter. It is relatively insensitive to temperature changes and gradients. The output signal of the accelerometer sensor 103 may be connected to, for example, the counter input T1 of the micro-controller 209 (FIG. 2). The data of the signal samples may be, for example, stored in the memory 210 signed by time for synchronizing with other simultaneously monitored data. Further analysis of the data downloaded to the computer may provide elimination of the spurious results of, for example, a blood pressure measurement caused by a hand moving during the measuring process. Other accelerometers or methods and systems of measuring acceleration or body movement may be used.",
        "FIG. 6a depicts a sample acceleration signal produced by processing data received from sensor 103, according to an embodiment of the present invention. This acceleration signal shows changes of velocity of a person's movements. It includes oscillation and constant components. For detection of a hand's rapid movements this signal may be processed and, for example, a differential of acceleration may be calculated. FIG. 6b shows the differential of the acceleration depicted in FIG. 6a, according to one embodiment. The analysis of this signal may provides detection of, for example, the rapid or significant motions of the hand, such as components 601 and 602.",
        "Typically, various physiologic, vital signs, physical and body orientation/activity data are collected substantially simultaneously and are recorded and/or transmitted to a remote site (e.g., a doctor's office) for analysis. Vital signs data may be analyzed in correlation with physical activity. The data collected may be, for example, time stamped, so that it can be displayed or analyzed side by side. For example, each data item may be signed by time for synchronizing with other simultaneously monitored data.",
