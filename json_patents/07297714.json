        "Cysteine proteases represent an enzymatic class of proteins that catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds by a nucleophilic sulfhydryl group of a cysteine residue in the active site of the enzyme. Several normal and disease processes in mammals have been associated with cysteine protease activity and include, but are not limited to: osteoporosis, osteoarthritis (Inui, T., O. Ishibashi, J Biol Chem 1997, 272(13), 8109-12; Saftig, P., E. Hunziker, et al., Adv Exp Med Biol 200030 ADs 2000, 477, 293-303; Saftig, P., E. Hunziker, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1998, 95(23), 13453-8), periodontal diseases, Paget's disease, atherosclerosis (Jormsjo, S., D. M. Wuttge, et al., Am J Pathol 2002 161(3), 939-45), multiple sclerosis (Beck, H., G. Schwarz, et al., Eur J Immunol 2001, 31(12), 3726-36), rheumatoid arthritis (Nakagawa, T. Y., W. H. Brissette, et al., Immunity 1999, 10(2), 207-17; Hou, W. S., Z. Li, et al., Am J Pathol 2001, 159(6), 2167-77), juvenile onset diabetes, lupus, asthma (Cimerman, N., P. M. Brguljan, et al., Pflugers Arch 2001, 442(6 Suppl 1), R204-6), tissue rejection, Alzheimer's disease (Lemere, C. A., J. S. Munger, et al., Am J Pathol 1995, 146(4), 848-60), Parkinson's disease (Liu, Y., L. Fallon, et al., Cell 2002, 111(2), 209-18), neuronal degeneration, shock (Jaeschke, H., M. A.

        "Cathepsins are a subclass of cysteine protease that belong to the enzyme classification EC 3.4.22 (Barrett, A. J., N. D. Rawlings, et al., Handbook of proteolytic enzymes. London, Academic Press). Cathepsins play a major role in lysosomal, endosomal, and extracellular protein degradation and have thus been implicated in many disease processes. For example, Cathepsin B [EC 3.4.22.1] has been postulated to play a role in tumor metastasis (Berquin, I. M. and B. F. Sloane Adv Exp Med Biol 1996, 389, 281-94).",
        "Cathepsin S [EC 3.4.22.27] is largely expressed in professional antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Cathepsin S has been shown to be required for proper MHC class II antigen presentation (Shi, G. P., J. A. Villadangos, et al., Immunity 1999, 10(2) 197-206). As a result of its non-redundant role in MHC class II antigen presentation, cathepsin S has been associated with inflammation, arthritis, and atherosclerosis. The selective expression of cathepsin K [EC 3.4.22.38] in osteoclasts coupled with the ability of cathepsin K to degrade type I collagen suggests that it plays a role in normal and pathogenic bone remodeling (Bromme, D., K. Okamoto, et al., J Biol Chem 1996, 271(4), 2126-32). There is a need in the art for compounds and methods that selectively inhibit specific cysteine proteases for treating several pathogenic disorders in mammals. The present invention satisfies these and other needs.",

        "An olefin was oxidized to the corresponding epoxide 9-A. Preferred methods for oxidation of olefin to epoxide include, but not limited to, the methyltrioxorhenium method (K. B. Sharpless et al. Chem. Commun. 1997, 1565; K. B. Sharpless et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 6189), dimethyldioxirane (Adam, W. et al Acc. Chem. Res. 1989, 22, 205), peracids (Camps, F. et al. J. Org. Chem. 1982, 47, 5402). Enatiomerically enriched epoxides can be obtained via asymmetric dihydroxylation as described in Sharpless, K. B. et al. Chem. Rev. 1994, 94, 2483; Sharpless, K. B. et al. In Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis Ojima, I. (Ed.); Wiley-VCH, 2002; 2nd Ed. Pp. 357-398. The epoxide 9-A was then opened to 9-B. If R6 is an NH containing heteroaryl, the reaction was done using powdered potassium carbonate in DMF and microwave irradiation. If R6 is an aliphatic amine, the reaction was done in neat amine using microwave irradiation. Expoxide like synthons such as cyclic sulfates and cyclic sulfites can be used in this transformation (B. B. Lohray Synthesis 1992, 1035). The hydroxyl of 9-B was then functionalized as a mixed carbonate 9-C. This was done with 4-nitrophenyl carbonate in pyridine or in DMF with DMAP as base. If these conditions were not tolerated, then the transformation was affected with phosgene in CH2Cl2. As those of skill in the art will recognize, other leaving groups (LG) can also be employed: methods for preparing compounds 9-C wherein LG is Cl are known in the art and may be used instead. Finally, the mixed carbonate 9C was reacted with an amine 1-A in DMF using DIEA as base to afford the desired carbamate 9-D.",
        "Alternative route to compounds described in this invention is shown in Scheme 10.",
        "",
        "Starting with a diol (available either through dihydroxylation of terminal olefins or reduction of the appropriate lactic acid), the primary hydroxyl group is selectively sulfonylated to generate 10-A. The terminal carbon is then functionalized using either a heteroaryl anion or an amine to afford 10-B. The secondary alcohol is then activated for carbamate formation using either nitrophenyl chloroformate or phosgene to afford 10-C. As above, other reactive acylating agents such as chloroforrnates (10-C, where LG\u2550Cl) may also be used by known methods. This intermediate is then reacted with amine 1-A to furnish the desired 10-D. For the preparation and derivatization of optically pure diols, see Sharpless, K. B. et al.

The reactions are initiated by adding the substrate, acetyl-histidine-proline-valine-lysine-amino carbamoyl coumarin, to a final concentration of 50 \u03bcM.
