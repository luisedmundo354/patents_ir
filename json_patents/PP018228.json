        "The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of New Zealand iris grown for use as an ornamental plant for container, border, deck, and patio. The new cultivar is known botanically as Libertia ixioides and will hereinafter be referred to by the cultivar name \u2018NNGF2\u2019.",
        "\u2018NNGF2\u2019 was discovered by the inventor at the inventor's nursery in Whenuapai, Auckland, New Zealand in 2002. The new Libertia variety \u2018NNGF2\u2019 was discovered as a naturally occurring seedling selection within a commercially grown crop of Libertia \u2018Goldfinger\u2019 (unpatented). Selection was based on the criterion of gold-yellow foliage. The female parent is an individual Libertia ixioides \u2018Goldfinger\u2019 and the male parent is an individual Libertia ixioides \u2018Goldfinger\u2019. The closest comparison plant known to the inventor is a Libertia ixioides \u2018Goldfinger\u2019 which exhibits foliage that is orange-yellow in color. \u2018NNGF2\u2019 is distinguishable from the comparison plant by a prominent golden-yellow central stripe on the leaf.",
        "\u2018NNGF2\u2019 is distinguishable from all other Libertia known to the inventor, by bright golden-yellow foliage, and profusions of white star-like flowers from mid-spring. In fall, flowers give way to large yellow berries. Asexual propagation is accomplished by the methods of tissue culture and division. Cultural requirements are moist, fertile soil, full sun to light shade and adequate but not excess water. Mature height and breadth is 0.60 m. \u2018NNGF2\u2019 is hardy to USDA Zone 7.",
        "\u2018NNGF2\u2019 was first asexually propagated in 2004 in Auckland, New Zealand. Asexual propagation was conducted by the inventor using the method of tissue culture. Since that time under careful observation \u2018NNGF2\u2019 has been determined stable, uniform, and reproduces true to type in successive generations of asexual propagation.",
        "The following traits have been repeatedly observed and represent the distinguishing characteristics of the new Libertia variety known as \u2018NNGF2\u2019. These traits in combination distinguish \u2018NNGF2\u2019 from all other varieties of Libertia known to the inventor. \u2018NNGF2\u2019 has not been tested under all possible conditions and phenotypic differences may be observed with variations in environmental, climatic, and cultural conditions, however, without any variance in genotype. Growing requirements are similar to the species.\n\n    \n    \n        1. \u2018NNGF2\u2019 exhibits compact clumping habit.\n        2. \u2018NNGF2\u2019 exhibits bright golden-yellow foliage.\n        3. \u2018NNGF2\u2019 exhibits fan-shaped habit.\n        4. \u2018NNGF2\u2019 is grown as an ornamental plant for container, border, deck, and patio.\n        5. \u2018NNGF2\u2019 exhibits profusions of white star-like flowers from mid-spring to summer.\n        6. Following the flowers \u2018NNGF2\u2019 exhibits large yellow berries in fall.\n        7. \u2018NNGF2\u2019 is propagated by the methods of tissue culture and division.\n        8. At maturity \u2018NNGF2\u2019 reaches 0.60 m. in height and breadth.\n        9. \u2018NNGF2\u2019 is hardy to USDA Zone 7.\n        10. Cultural requirements for \u2018NNGF2\u2019 include adequate but not excess water, moist fertile soil, and full sun to light shade.",
        "The accompanying color drawings illustrate the overall appearance of the new Libertia variety named \u2018NNGF2\u2019 showing colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type.",
        "The drawing labeled FIG. 1 depicts plants of \u2018NNGF2\u2019 from a side perspective illustrating habit. The plants shown are approximately 18 months old and have been grown out of doors in Auckland, New Zealand.",
        "The drawing labeled FIG. 2 is a close-up view of the flower. Color in the drawings may differ from color values cited in the detailed botanical description, which accurately describe the actual color of the new variety \u2018NNGF2\u2019.",
        "Drawings labeled FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 were made using conventional techniques and although flower and foliage color may appear different from actual color due to light reflectance, they are as accurate as possible by conventional photography.",
        "The following is a detailed description of the new Libertia cultivar named \u2018NNGF2\u2019. Data was collected and compiled in spring of 2006 in a cultivated area of Arroyo Grande, Calif. from 18 month old plants in 10 cm. container.
