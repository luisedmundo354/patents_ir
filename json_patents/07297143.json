        "This application claims the benefit of U.S. Ser. No. 60/445,405 filed Feb. 5, 2003.",
        "The present invention relates generally to the field of electrosurgical devices, and more particularly to methods and devices allowing for the monitoring of temperature in regions adjacent, in contact with, and/or surrounding a working end of such electrosurgical devices.",
        "Electrosurgical procedures are extremely common in today's medical practice. For example, present uses of electrosurgical devices include ablation, dissection, resection, coagulation, contraction, or otherwise modification of a broad range of tissues and organs. Thus, general surgery, cosmetic surgery, neurosurgery, laparoscopy, as well as arthroscopic procedures, etc., routinely employ electrosurgical devices and techniques. However, unintended and excessive heating of non-target tissue during the procedure is a common concern in most electrosurgical applications. Such unintended heating of non-target tissue may cause inadvertent necrosis or other damage. Naturally, a medical practitioner employing such devices has a need to know the temperature of the region adjacent to, surrounding, and/or in contact with the working end of the device.",
        "Most electrosurgical cutting devices operate by applying electrical energy to affect tissue. In a first mode, electrical current flows through tissue and as a result of a high current density at the working end of the electrosurgical device (e.g., an electrode), an electrical arc forms across a gap between the electrode and the target tissue. The arc results in rapid tissue heating and vaporization of cellular fluids into steam. In another mode, electrical energy may be directly conducted through tissue, but instead of forming an arc, the resistive properties of the tissue result in heating of the tissue to produce a thermal effect. In yet another mode, as developed by ArthroCare Corporation, Sunnyvale Calif., RF energy is applied to a conductive medium (usually saline), causing a highly focused plasma field to form around the electrodes. This plasma field is comprised of highly ionized particles which have sufficient energy to break organic molecular bonds within tissue. The by-products of this non-heat driven process are elementary molecules and low molecular weight gases. This latter mode is a non-heat driven (the ablation is achieved via the ionized particles) low temperature (surface tissue temperatures 40\u201370\u00b0 C.) ablative process and is termed Coblation\u00ae. The Coblation\u00ae process is discussed more thoroughly below.",
        "In all of the modes described above, a certain amount of heat is generated in the tissue as either a by-product or as a direct result of the mode. This heat conducts through tissue. In the modes which rely on passing electrical current through tissue, electrical current as well as heat conduct through tissue. As a result, heating often occurs not only in or near the target tissue but also in regions surrounding the target tissue. Accordingly, such heating of the surrounding tissue may result in undesirable collateral tissue damage.",
        "Another problem may be found as some surgical procedures require a \u201cwet\u201d field, (i.e., the surgical site is immersed in a fluid medium.) Heat generated by the electrosurgical procedure may accumulate in the fluid medium through transfer of heat into the fluid. In those cases where the fluid medium is a electrically conductive, shorting of the electrode(s) may also occur and result in additional unintended heating in the treatment area. Ultimately, too much additional heating may result in excessive collateral tissue damage.",
        "A number of electrosurgical devices are known that include temperature sensors for sensing temperature in or around a surgical site during a procedure. Such devices typically use electrical temperature sensors, such as thermistors, thermocouples, resistance temperature detectors (RTDs), or fiber optic-based temperature sensors (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,293,943 and 6,197,021, both to Panescu et al.).",
        "However, during the procedures described above, a medical practitioner's attention is mainly focused on the operative field either through a viewing monitor (e.g., during a less invasive procedure) or direct visualization (e.g., an open surgical procedure.) Accordingly, there remains a need remains for the medical practitioner to be able to identify the temperature in regions adjacent to, in contact with, and/or surrounding a working end of a electrosurgical devices without solely having to remove his or her attention from the operative field. There also remains a need to provide such a medical device that is disposable and compatible with existing controllers or power supplies.",
        "The present invention provides systems, devices, and methods for the monitoring of temperature in regions adjacent, in contact with, and/or surrounding an electrosurgical device.",
        "The invention includes a device having an energy delivery assembly comprising at least one energy delivery element. The device will be coupled to an energy delivery unit. In the operative area of the device, or at any portion of the device that would intersect a patient, the device will include at least one temperature indicating element that gives the medical practitioner or operator of the device a visual indication that a particular temperature adjacent to the device is reached. The device may have one or more temperature-indicating elements, each having one or more activation-temperature ranges.",
        "The temperature-indicating element may be reversible, that is it may give a real-time indication of the temperature adjacent to the element. For example, as the area around the element increases in temperature, the element will give a visual indication upon reaching an initial activation temperature. When the surrounding area cools, the temperature indicating element will revert to its natural state. Alternatively, the temperature indicating element may give an irreversible indication of the temperature adjacent to the element.",
        "One variation of the invention includes an electrosurgical device generally having an elongated shaft having proximal and distal end portions, at least one active electrode disposed on the elongated shaft for applying energy to a patient's tissue, one or more connectors for coupling the active electrode to a source of high frequency electrical energy (e.g., an electrosurgical generator or power supply) and at least one temperature-indicating element which is readily visible to the operator of the device during a procedure. The device typically further includes a return electrode, spaced from the active electrode(s). The temperature-indicating element(s) may be exposed on or conforms to an external surface of the shaft. Typically, the temperature-indicating element is located at a working end of the shaft and/or may be located along any portion or portions of the device where information regarding surrounding temperature is desired.",
        "The temperature-indicating element may include a thermochromic composition, such as an ink, paint, film, sheet, etc., formulated to undergo a visibly apparent transition at one or more pre-defined temperatures. For example, in the many electrosurgical procedures contemplated under the invention the one or more pre-defined temperatures are typically in the range of from about 40\u00b0 C. to 95\u00b0 C. The pre-defined temperature at which the temperature-indicating element undergoes a thermochromic transition may vary, e.g., according to the procedure, e.g., the nature of the target tissue (bone, cartilage, skin), and the intended effect of treatment (ablation, coagulation, contraction). The temperature-indicating element may also include a separate element that incorporates the thermochromatic/thermochromic composition.",
        "In certain embodiments of the invention, a temperature-indicating element may comprise a thermochromic composition that may be applied, or affixed, to the shaft of a device over a temperature indicator base or pad. Such a temperature indicator base may serve to attach the temperature-indicating element to the shaft.

        "As noted above, although the present invention may be applied to any type of electrosurgical device, including those using (RF) energy, the device is particularly useful in those devices using Coblation\u00ae technology (plasma assisted electrosurgical ablation devices).",
        "Coblation\u00ae requires application of a high frequency voltage difference between one or more active electrode(s) and one or more return electrode(s) to develop high electric field intensities in the vicinity of the target tissue. The high electric field intensities may be generated by applying a high frequency voltage that is sufficient to vaporize an electrically conductive medium over at least a portion of the active electrode(s) in the region between the distal tip of the active electrode(s) and the target tissue. The electrically conductive medium may be, for example, a liquid, gel or gas. Such electrically conductive medium include isotonic saline, blood, extracelluar or intracellular fluid, delivered to, or already present at, the target site, or a viscous medium, such as a gel, applied to the target site.",
        "When the conductive medium is heated enough such that atoms vaporize off the surface faster than they recondense, a gas is formed. When the gas is sufficiently heated such that the atoms collide with each other and knock their electrons off in the process, an ionized gas or plasma is formed (the so-called \u201cfourth state of matter\u201d). Generally speaking, plasmas may be formed by heating a gas and ionizing the gas by driving an electric current through it, or by shining radio waves into the gas. These methods of plasma formation give energy to free electrons in the plasma directly, and then electron-atom collisions liberate more electrons, and the process cascades until the desired degree of ionization is achieved. A more complete description of plasma can be found in Plasma Physics, by R. J. Goldston and P. H. Rutherford of the Plasma Physics Laboratory of Princeton University (1995), the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "As the density of the plasma or vapor layer becomes sufficiently low (i.e., less than approximately 1020 atoms/cm3 for aqueous solutions), the electron mean free path increases to enable subsequently injected electrons to cause impact ionization within the vapor layer). Once the ionic particles in the plasma layer have sufficient energy, they accelerate towards the target tissue. Energy evolved by the energetic electrons (e.g., 3.5 eV to 5 eV) can subsequently bombard a molecule and break its bonds, dissociating a molecule into free radicals, which then combine into final gaseous or liquid species. Often, the electrons carry the electrical current or absorb the radio waves and, therefore, are hotter than the ions. Thus, the electrons, which are carried away from the tissue towards the return electrode, carry most of the plasma's heat with them, allowing the ions to break apart the tissue molecules in a substantially non-thermal manner.",
        "By means of this molecular dissociation (rather than thermal evaporation or carbonization), the target tissue structure is volumetrically removed through molecular disintegration of larger organic molecules into smaller molecules and/or atoms, such as hydrogen, oxygen, oxides of carbon, hydrocarbons and nitrogen compounds. This molecular disintegration completely removes the tissue structure, as opposed to dehydrating the tissue material by the removal of liquid within the cells of the tissue and extracellular fluids, as is typically the case with electrosurgical desiccation and vaporization. A more detailed description of this phenomena can be found in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,697,882 the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "In some applications of the Coblation technology, high frequency (RF) electrical energy is applied in an electrically conducting media environment to shrink or remove (i.e., resect, cut, or ablate) a tissue structure and to seal transected vessels within the region of the target tissue. Coblation technology is also useful for sealing larger arterial vessels, e.g., on the order of about 1 mm in diameter. In such applications, a high frequency power supply is provided having an ablation mode, wherein a first voltage is applied to an active electrode sufficient to effect molecular dissociation or disintegration of the tissue, and a coagulation mode, wherein a second, lower voltage is applied to an active electrode (either the same or a different electrode) sufficient to heat, shrink, and/or achieve hemostasis of severed vessels within the tissue. In other applications, an electrosurgical instrument is provided having one or more coagulation electrode(s) configured for sealing a severed vessel, such as an arterial vessel, and one or more active electrodes configured for either contracting the collagen fibers within the tissue or removing (ablating) the tissue, e.g., by applying sufficient energy to the tissue to effect molecular dissociation. A single voltage can be applied to the tissue by the coagulation electrode(s), as well as to the active electrode(s) to ablate or shrink the tissue. In certain applications, the power supply is combined with the coagulation instrument such that the coagulation electrode is used when the power supply is in the coagulation mode (low voltage), and the active electrode(s) are used when the power supply is in the ablation mode (higher voltage).",
        "The amount of energy produced by the Coblation\u00ae technology may be varied by adjusting a variety of factors, such as: the number of active electrodes; electrode size and spacing; electrode surface area; asperities and sharp edges on the electrode surfaces; electrode materials; applied voltage and power; current limiting means, such as inductors; electrical conductivity of the medium in contact with the electrodes; density of the medium; and other factors. Accordingly, these factors can be manipulated to control the energy level of the excited electrons. Since different tissue structures have different molecular bonds, the Coblation\u00ae device may be configured to produce energy sufficient to break the molecular bonds of certain tissue but insufficient to break the molecular bonds of other tissue. For example, fatty tissue, (e.g., adipose) tissue has double bonds that require an energy level substantially higher than 4 eV to 5 eV (typically on the order of about 8 eV) to break. Accordingly, the Coblation\u00ae technology generally does not ablate or remove such fatty tissue; however, it may be used to effectively ablate cells to release the inner fat content in a liquid form. Of course, factors may be changed such that these double bonds can also be broken in a similar fashion as the single bonds (e.g., increasing voltage or changing the electrode configuration to increase the current density at the electrode tips). A more complete description of this phenomena can be found in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,355,032, 6,149,120 and 6,296,136, the complete disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "The active electrode(s) of a Coblation\u00ae device are preferably supported within or by an inorganic insulating support positioned near the distal end of the instrument shaft. The return electrode may be located on the instrument shaft, on another instrument or on the external surface of the patient (i.e., a dispersive pad). The proximal end of the instrument(s) will include the appropriate electrical connections for coupling the return electrode(s) and the active electrode(s) to a high frequency power supply, such as an electrosurgical generator.",
        "While Coblation\u00ae ablates tissue in a non-thermal manner, surface temperature of the tissue has been observed to be in the range of 40\u201370\u00b0 C. Accordingly, it still may be desirable for the medical practitioner to have the ability to directly observe the temperature environment of the surgical site when using a Coblation\u00ae device. However, it is noted that the invention described herein may be applied to any type of surgical instrument which generates heat either directly, or as a by-product of the procedure. For example, the invention may be incorporated in devices using microwave energy, laser, UV light based, mechanical energy, etc. It is noted that the device has particular value in thermal electrosurgical devices.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, radio frequency (RF) electrical energy is applied to one or more active electrodes of a device in the presence of an electrically conductive fluid, to remove and/or modify at least a portion of a target tissue or organ. Depending on the specific procedure, the present invention may be used to: (1) ablate (i.e., volumetrically remove or effect the molecular dissociation of) tissue, including soft tissue, bone, and cartilage; (2) cut or resect tissue; (3) shrink or contract collagen containing tissue; and/or (4) coagulate, occlude, and sever blood vessels.",
        "An electrosurgical device of the invention typically includes a shaft having a proximal end and a distal or working end portion, and one or more active electrodes at the shaft distal end portion. In some embodiments, the active electrode(s) will be disposed at the distal tip or apex of the device. Alternatively or additionally, the active electrode(s) may be formed on lateral surfaces of the shaft (e.g., for facilitating access to a target tissue in certain procedures). A return electrode is typically spaced from the active electrode(s) by an electrically insulating electrode support or spacer.",
        "The shaft may assume a wide variety of configurations. The shaft mechanically supports the active electrode(s), and enables the treating physician or surgeon to manipulate the active electrode(s) from the proximal end of the device. The shaft may be linear, variously curved, rigid, malleable or flexible. Flexible shafts may be combined with pull wires, shape memory actuators, or other known mechanisms for effecting selective deflection of the distal end of the shaft to facilitate positioning of the shaft distal end/active electrode(s) with respect to the target tissue.",
        "Typically, devices of the invention are adapted for coupling to an electrosurgical generator incorporating a RF power supply, wherein the power supply is capable of operation in an ablation mode (for ablating tissue), or a sub-ablation mode (for coagulating or otherwise modifying the tissue). Typically, electrosurgical devices of the invention will include one or more electrode leads by which the electrode(s) are connected to a connection block. The connector is adapted for coupling the electrode(s) to the generator or power supply. Typically, the connector includes a plurality of pins for coupling to the power supply via a connector cable.",
        "Devices of the invention may use a single active electrode or an electrode array distributed over a working end of the device. In the latter embodiment, the electrode array may include a plurality of independently current-limited and/or power-controlled active electrodes to apply electrical energy selectively to the target tissue while limiting the unwanted application of electrical energy to the surrounding tissue and environment. In one configuration, each individual active electrode in the electrode array is electrically insulated from all other active electrodes in the array, and each active electrode is connected to a power source which is isolated from each of the other active electrodes in the array, or to circuitry which limits or interrupts current flow to the active electrode when low resistivity material (e.g., blood, saline) causes a lower impedance path between the return electrode and the particular active electrode. Apparatus incorporating independently current-limited and/or power-controlled active electrodes is described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,312,408, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.",
        "It should be clearly understood that the invention is not limited to electrically isolated active electrodes, or even to a plurality of active electrodes. For example, the array of active electrodes may be connected to a single lead that extends through the probe shaft to a source of high frequency current. In one embodiment, the probe may have only a single active electrode that extends from an insulating spacer at the probe distal end. The active electrode(s) may have a ball shape (e.g., for tissue vaporization and desiccation), a twizzle shape (for vaporization and needle-like cutting), a spring shape (for rapid tissue debulking and desiccation), a twisted metal shape, an annular or solid cylindrical shape, or various other regular or irregular shapes.",
        "The voltage applied between the active and return electrodes will typically be in the radio frequency (RF) range, having a frequency between about 5 kHz and 20 MHz, usually being between about 30 kHz and 2.5 MHz, and often between about 100 kHz and 200 kHz. The RMS (root mean square) voltage applied will usually be in the range from about 5 volts RMS to 1500 volts RMS, typically being in the range of from about 10 volts RMS to 900 volts RMS, and often in the range of from about 20 volts RMS to 500 volts RMS, depending on the active electrode size and geometry, the operating frequency, and the particular procedure or desired effect on the tissue (e.g., ablation, contraction, coagulation). Typically, the peak-to-peak voltage will be in the range of 10 to 2000 volts, usually in the range of 20 to 1200 volts, and often in the range of about 40 to 800 volts (again, depending on the electrode size, the operating frequency, and the operation mode). Voltage parameters for various electrosurgical procedures are presented in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,235,020, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.",
        "The voltage is typically delivered in a series of voltage pulses or alternating current of time varying voltage amplitude having a sufficiently high frequency (e.g., on the order of 5 kHz to 20 MHz) such that the voltage is effectively applied continuously (as compared with, e.g., certain lasers adapted for shallow depths of tissue necrosis, which are generally pulsed at about 10 Hz to 20 Hz). In addition, the duty cycle (i.e., cumulative time in any one-second interval that energy is applied) is on the order of about 50% for apparatus of the present invention, as compared with a duty cycle of about 0.0001% for many pulsed lasers.",
        "The application of a suitable high frequency voltage between the active and return electrodes effects cutting, removal, ablation, shaping, contracting, coagulating, or other form of modification of the target tissue. The tissue volume over which energy is dissipated may be precisely controlled, for example, by the use of a multiplicity of small active electrodes whose effective diameters or principal dimensions typically range from about 5 mm to 0.01 mm, and usually from about 2 mm to 0.05 mm. In these embodiments, electrode areas for both circular and non-circular electrode terminals will have a contact area (per active electrode) of 25 mm2 or less, typically being in the range from 5 mm2 to 0.005 mm2. In general, the use of relatively small diameter active electrodes increases the electric field intensity, and reduces the extent or depth of tissue heating as a consequence of the divergence of current flux lines which emanate from the exposed surface of each active electrode.",
        "A preferred power supply of the present invention delivers a high frequency current selectable to generate average power levels ranging from several milliwatts to tens of watts per electrode, depending on the volume of target tissue being treated, and/or the maximum allowed temperature selected for the probe tip. The power supply allows the user to select the voltage level according to the specific requirements of a particular procedure, e.g., FESS procedure, dermatological procedure, ophthalmic procedure, arthroscopic surgery or other endoscopic surgery, or open surgery. A description of a power supply adapted for electrosurgery can be found in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,142,992, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.",
        "A current flow path between the active and return electrodes may be provided by delivering an electrically conductive fluid (e.g., an electrically conductive gel or saline) to the working end of the device. To provide a suitable current flow path between the active and return electrodes, an electrically conductive fluid delivered to the working end of the device should have a suitable electrical conductivity, typically at least 0.2 millisiemens per centimeter (mS/cm), usually greater than 2 mS/cm, and often greater than 10 mS/cm. In one embodiment, the electrically conductive fluid is isotonic saline, which has a conductivity of about 17 mS/cm. In other embodiments, electrically conductive fluids having electrical conductivity values much higher than that of isotonic saline may also be used.

        "In some procedures, it may also be necessary to retrieve or aspirate excess or unwanted materials, e.g., saline, ablation by-products, from the target site. For example, in procedures in the nose, mouth or throat, it may be desirable to aspirate saline so that it does not flow down the patient's throat. In addition, it may be desirable to aspirate resected tissue fragments, blood, mucus, gaseous ablation by-products, etc., from the surgical site. Accordingly, systems of the invention may include an aspiration element or lumen, which may be integral with the device, for aspirating materials from the target site.

        "One variation of the visual temperature-indicating element 250 typically includes a thermochromic layer of a composition or material, such as an organic polymer in the form of a leuco dye or a liquid crystal, which exhibits a pronounced or readily discernible change in appearance upon exposure to a pre-defined temperature or temperature regime (temperature/time combination). The thermochromic composition is adapted or formulated to undergo one or more distinct visual changes (for example, but not limited to a change in color, shade, hues, saturations or contrasts) upon reaching a particular temperature or range of temperatures. Such change(s) in color may include changing from a colored state to a colorless state or visa-versa, from a dark color to a lighter color or visa-versa. In response to this visual change, application of energy via probe 201 can be discontinued, or the energy level can be decreased.",
        "The present invention may incorporate any number of various types and formulations of thermochromic compositions, including paints, inks, plastics, rubbers, labels, self-adhesive strips, crayons, and synthetic films or sheets, are well known in the art (see, for example, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Fourth Edition, J. I. Kroschwitz & M. Howe-Grant, Eds., Published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.) and may be used with the present invention. A broad range of thermochromic paints are commercially available, e.g., from Lakfabriek Korthals BV, Postbus 135, 1970 AC IJmuiden, The Netherlands and from TMC, Northbrook, Ill. Thermochromic liquid crystal Mylar sheets are available, for example, from Omega Engineering, Inc., Stamford, Conn. One thermochromic ink suitable for use with the present invention is DynaColor\u2122 epoxy screen ink distributed by Chromatic Technologies, Incorporated. This ink is colored below a specific temperature and changes to colorless or to another, lighter color as it is heated through a defined temperature range. This color change is reversible in that the original color is restored upon cooling of the ink.",
        "It may be desirable to place provide some type of protective covering for the temperature element. For example, the thermochromic materials for use with the present invention may be applied to an external surface of a device and then covered by a biocompatible sheath, e.g., comprising a transparent or translucent plastic. Such a sheath may be electrically and/or thermally insulating. In the latter case, the activation temperature of temperature element may be affected by the insulation. However, simple experimentation allows for proper selection of the temperature range of the element and notice as to what external temperature event affects the element.",
        "The temperature element may be formulated with other materials to modify or enhance their color change characteristics. For example, a thermochromic composition may be encapsulated within microscopic capsules or microcapsules, e.g., having diameters in the range of from about 1 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm, and added to a host medium (e.g., a polymer or pigmented resin) to provide a thermochromic composition.",
        "The temperature above which the temperature element begins to change visual appearance shall be referred to as the initial activation temperature of an activation temperature range. The temperature at which the temperature element completes the visual transformation shall define the upper limit of the activation temperature range. The activation temperature range of the temperature element is often a function of the chemical structure or physical configuration of the element or composition forming the element. The thermochromic activation temperature range can be tailored by chemical modification of components of the composition, and/or by adjusting the proportions of one or more components of the composition. The activation temperature range is variable and may be optimized according to the particular type of tissue being treated, e.g., bone, skin, cartilage, and the intended effect on the tissue, e.g., ablation, contraction. For example, a first device intended for ablating hard connective tissue during an arthroscopic procedure may be provided with a first temperature indicating element adapted to indicate a first pre-defined temperature; whereas a second device intended for shrinking collagen containing tissue during a cosmetic procedure may be provided with a second temperature indicating element adapted to indicate a second pre-defined temperature. Typically, the temperatures to be monitored during electrosurgical procedures are well within this range (e.g., from about 40\u00b0 C. to 95\u00b0 C.). As one example only, and not to limit the invention in any way, the temperature-indicating element may comprise a material that undergoes a distinct, readily recognized color change when it experiences a temperature increase to 65\u00b0 C.",
        "The temperature-indicating element may be selected to have more than one specific activation temperatures or temperature ranges. Some thermochromic compositions may undergo a series of color changes with change in temperature, i.e., the temperature-indicating element composition may exhibit a plurality of different colors as the temperature changes, wherein at least one of the different colors is indicative of a particular temperature value or temperature range. For example, the temperature-indicating element may have three activation temperatures, e.g., 45\u00b0 C., 65\u00b0 C. and about 80\u00b0 C., where the element changes colors upon a change from a preferred temperature or range to an acceptable temperature or range to an unacceptable temperature or range, that latter of which may indicate a temperature at which tissue is at a risk of becoming damaged. Thermochromic liquid crystalline materials, e.g., cholesteric liquid crystals, nemetic liquid crystals, and smectic liquid crystals, are highly suitable for such an application. Each thermochromic liquid crystal composition typically exhibits a range of color changes as the temperature changes (increases and decreases) through a defined temperature range. For example, as the temperature increases through a particular temperature range, the composition may change from brown to red, then yellow, green, blue, violet, and black. Liquid crystals may be categorized according to their red start (or \u201cevent\u201d) temperature and bandwidth (see, for example, the article by D. J. Farino, entitled Making Surface Temperature Measurements Using Liquid Crystal Thermography (http://www.electronics-cooling.com/Resources/EC Articles/OCT95/oct95\u201401.htm)).",
        "In some embodiments, the temperature value indicated by the temperature-indicating element may directly provide a useful estimate of the tissue temperature. In other embodiments, a correction factor may be used to estimate a temperature of the target tissue, based on the temperature value indicated by the temperature-indicating element. The value of such a correction factor may depend, for example, on the location of the temperature-indicating element with respect to the active electrode(s), parameters of the voltage applied to the active electrode(s), and other parameters. As an example only, consider a procedure in which it is desired to heat the target tissue to a temperature of y\u00b0 C. In a situation where the temperature differential between the temperature indicating element and the target tissue is x\u00b0 C., the temperature-indicating element can be adapted to show a change in appearance at a temperature of (y\u2212x)\u00b0 C. Such a change in appearance of the temperature-indicating element may comprise, for example, an alpha-numeric signal, e.g., a text message (see, e.g., FIG. 9C).",

According to one embodiment, base 880 may comprise a thermally insulating or thermally reflective material, wherein base 880 serves to thermally insulate or isolate temperature indicating element 850 from shaft 802. According to one embodiment, base 880 may comprise an electrically insulating material which serves to electrically insulate element 850 from other components of device 801.",
        "In another embodiment of the invention, indicator base 880 may comprise a material adapted to affix, or adhere, element 850 to shaft 802. For example, in embodiments where element 850 comprises a thermochromic paint, base 880 may comprise a primer layer to which the thermochromic paint is applied. In another example, temperature-indicating element 850 may comprise a printable medium printed with thermochromic ink, and base 880 may comprise an adhesive for affixing the printable medium to shaft 802. In another embodiment, base 880 may be adapted to maximize or promote the appearance of element 850 before and/or after a thermochromic transition (change in color). For example, base 880 may be variously colored (e.g., black or white, depending on the color change(s) of the thermochromic material) to enhance visualization of the thermochromic transition of element 850. In other embodiments, indicator base 880 may be omitted, and a thermochromic paint or varnish, a printable medium, or a thermochromic film may be applied directly to shaft 802, with or without a covering element (e.g., a light-transmitting sheath, FIG. 7). Media printable with thermochromic ink include synthetic films, glass, ceramics, thermoplastics, and various fabrics. Thermochromic inks and thermochromic paints are commercially available, e.g., from Matsui International Co., Inc., Gardena, Calif.",
        "FIGS. 9A\u2013C each schematically represent an electrosurgical device having a temperature indicating element disposed on a distal end portion of a shaft of the device, according to three different embodiments of the instant invention. FIG. 9A shows a distal end portion 902a of a shaft 902 of a device, as seen in plan view (e.g., FIG. 6F). The device includes a temperature-indicating element 950 disposed at shaft distal end portion 902a. Indicating element 950 comprises a plurality of thermochromic cells 954a\u2013n. Five such thermochromic cells are shown in FIG. 9A, although other numbers are also within the scope of the invention.",
        "In one embodiment, each of the plurality of thermochromic cells 954a\u2013n comprises a different thermochromic composition, such that each cell 954a\u2013n has different, defined thermochromic properties. For example, each cell 954a\u2013n may have a different thermochromic transition temperature. Thus, the plurality of cells 954a\u2013n may undergo a color change at a corresponding plurality of different temperatures. In some embodiments, indicating element 950 may be configured such that cells 954a\u2013n sequentially undergo a thermochromic transition, e.g., from left to right, as the temperature at shaft distal end portion 902a increases within a defined temperature range. For example, cells 954a, 954b, 954c, and 954d may successively undergo a thermochromic transition at temperatures of 50\u00b0 C., 55\u00b0 C., 60\u00b0 C., and 65\u00b0 C., respectively. The type of color change, e.g., from a first color to a second color, or from a colored to a colorless state, may be the same or different for cells 954a\u2013n.",
        "Indicating element 950 may be arranged circumferentially on shaft distal end portion 902a, and indicating element 950 may conform to the external surface of shaft 902. Typically, the device of FIG. 9A will include an electrode assembly having at least one active electrode. Electrode(s) are omitted from FIG. 9A for the sake of clarity.",
        "FIG. 9B is a plan view of the distal or working end of an device, showing a temperature indicating element 950\u2032 disposed at shaft distal end portion 902a. Temperature-indicating element 950\u2032 is configured to display one or more of a plurality of numeric values according to a defined temperature condition of shaft distal end portion 902a. As shown, a plurality of numeric values is indistinctly visible, while one numeric value is distinctly displayed to indicate a temperature corresponding to the displayed numeric value (i.e., 55\u00b0 C.). In alternative embodiments, all numeric values other than that indicative of the actual temperature condition may be invisible. As an example, numeric values corresponding to a range of temperatures, or other alpha-numeric characters, may be made to sequentially appear at particular thermochromic transition temperatures by formulating a plurality of thermochromic compositions to undergo a color change at those temperatures corresponding to each of the plurality of numeric values.",
        "In one embodiment, indicating element 950\u2032 may comprise a plurality of thermochromic cells (see, e.g., FIG. 9A). Each thermochromic cell may have a different thermochromic formulation, such that each cell has a different thermochromic signature or thermochromic transition characteristics. As an example, each of the plurality of thermochromic cells may be adapted to display a different numeral, and the plurality of thermochromic cells can be formulated to undergo a thermochromic transition, e.g., from colored to colorless, at the temperature corresponding to the numeral(s) which it displays. Thus, when the thermochromic composition becomes colorless, the numeral underlying the thermochromic composition becomes readily visible to an operator of the device, thereby indicating the temperature corresponding to the numeric value. In alternative embodiments, alpha-numeric characters may be used to signify a particular temperature or temperature range, as opposed to showing actual temperature values. For example, the numerals I\u2013V (or the letters A\u2013E) could be used to signify five different temperatures or temperature ranges, e.g., numerals I, II, and III could correspond to 45\u00b0 C., 50\u00b0 C., and 55\u00b0 C., respectively.",
        "FIG. 9C also shows a plan view of the distal or working end of an device, the device including a temperature indicating element 950\u2033 disposed at shaft distal end portion 902a. Temperature indicating element 950\u2033 includes a message unit 956 and is adapted to display one or more alpha-numeric characters, or a message, when a defined temperature condition applies. For example, according to one embodiment a message may be imprinted on message unit 956 in a thermochromic material (e.g., a thermochromic ink or thermochromic paint), wherein the thermochromic material is formulated to undergo a color change (e.g., from brown to green) at a pre-defined temperature. Alternatively, a text message imprinted on an underlying medium may be overlaid with a layer of thermochromic material formulated to undergo a thermochromic transition from colored/opaque to colorless/translucent at a defined temperature, whereby the underlying text message becomes visible through the thermochromic layer at the defined temperature.",
        "In one embodiment, a message displayed by indicating element 950\u2033 may be a text message, e.g., for warning an operator of the device that sufficient heat had been generated at the working end of the device for treatment of the tissue. To cite just a few examples, following a thermochromic transition, element 950\u2033 may be adapted to display one or more of the following messages \u201cREDUCE POWER,\u201d \u201cREMOVE PROBE,\u201d or \u201cEND!\u201d. As an example of how element 950\u2033 may be useful in practice, consider a procedure for electrosurgically shrinking collagen containing tissue (for which a temperature in the range of 60\u00b0 C. to 70\u00b0 C. may be desired). Element 950\u2033 may be adapted, formulated, and configured to reveal one or more text messages, e.g., when exposed to a temperature below 60\u00b0 C., and/or in excess of 65\u00b0 C. Apparatus and procedures for shrinking collagen-containing tissue are described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,309,387 and 6,277,112, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.",

        "Device 1001 still further includes a temperature-indicating element 1050 on shaft distal end portion 1002a. Temperature-indicating element 1050 is in the form of a thermochromic annular band, which may comprise, for example, a plastic or a rubber having a thermochromic composition incorporated therein. The annular band and the thermochromic composition may be formulated and configured to undergo a distinct change in appearance, due to a thermochromic transition, upon exposure to a pre-selected temperature.",

Although element 1050 is shown in FIG. 10 as being located distal to return electrode 1016 and proximal to spacer 1014, other configurations are also within the scope of the invention (see, e.g., FIGS. 6A\u2013F).",
        "FIGS. 11A\u2013C schematically represent use of a device in a surgical procedure during which a temperature indicating element of the device undergoes a visual change. FIG. 11A schematically represents an electrosurgical device or probe 1101 including a shaft 1102 having a shaft distal end portion 1102a. Shaft distal end portion 1102a is positioned with respect to a target tissue, TT to be treated. Probe 1101 further includes a temperature indicating element 1150 disposed at shaft distal end portion 1102a. Temperature indicating element 1150 typically includes a thermochromic material, and is adapted to undergo a readily discernible change in appearance in order to indicate a temperature condition to a user of probe 1101.

        "Temperature indicating element 1150 may include various elements, features, and characteristics as described hereinabove for temperature indicating elements according to various embodiments of the invention (e.g., with reference to FIGS. 6A\u201310). Similarly, probe 1101 may include various elements, features, and characteristics as described hereinabove for various devices according to other embodiments of the invention (e.g., with reference to FIGS. 1\u201310). Thus, probe 1101 typically includes at least one active electrode or electrode terminal adapted for applying energy to the target tissue to be treated. Electrodes are omitted from FIGS. 11A\u2013C for the sake of clarity.",
        "Probe 1101 is coupled to an electrosurgical generator or power supply 1128 via a cable 1160. Typically, power supply 1128 is adapted for supplying a RF, alternating-current voltage (ac voltage) to the target tissue via probe 1101. During application of energy to the target tissue, shaft distal end portion 1102a is positioned adjacent to, or in contact with, the target tissue. As shown, a remote control unit or switch 1190 may be coupled to power supply 1128. As an example, unit 1190 may comprise one or more foot pedals for controlling power output from power supply 1128. An electrosurgical apparatus having foot pedal controls is described fully in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,264,650 (Atty. Ref. No. S-5), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.",
        "FIGS. 11B and 11C show enlarged views of the distal end of probe 1101 at time T1 and time T2, respectively. Time T1 represents a stage in the procedure before the working end of probe 1101 has been heated to a an initial activation temperature for the respective temperature indicating element 1150. It can be observed that at time T1 element 1150 has a first appearance. As an example only, element 1150 may comprise a liquid crystal exhibiting a brown color at time T1.",
        "With reference to FIG. 11C, time T2 represents a stage where the working end of probe 1101 has attained a particular pre-defined temperature, as indicated by element 1150 adopting a second appearance, wherein the second appearance is readily discernible from the first appearance. For example, the second appearance may signify that a desired target temperature for the procedure has been attained. As an example, the second appearance may be a green color indicative of a temperature in the middle of the thermochromic liquid crystal bandwidth. Thus, the change in appearance of element 1150 at time T2 may signal the surgeon that the application of energy to the target tissue may be discontinued, and the procedure can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. Such changes in appearance of element 1150 in response to change in temperature may be obtained by suitable formulation of a thermochromic composition as a component of element 1150, as described hereinabove.",
        "According to an alternative aspect of the invention, a change in appearance of element 1150 at time T2 may inform the surgeon of the heat adjacent to the procedure and to adjust the level of power supplied to device 1101 from power supply 1128. It should be noted that the temperature indicating element may give a dynamic visual indication of temperature at a location adjacent to the device. Once the surgeon stops treatment or the site cools, the temperature indicating element will revert to its natural state (e.g., a clear color.)",
        "FIG. 12 is a block diagram schematically representing an endoscopic electrosurgical system 1200, according to another embodiment of the invention. System 1200 typically includes an endoscope 1280; an device 1201, which may be adapted for use in conjunction with endoscope 1280; a power supply 1228 for supplying power to device 1201; as well as a camera 1282 and a monitor 1284 adapted for viewing a working end of device 1201 and the surgical site. Device 1201 typically comprises an electrosurgical catheter or an electrosurgical probe having an electrode assembly disposed at the working end of the device (e.g., as described hereinabove).

        "Device 1201 is adapted for providing a visual indication to the surgeon, via camera 1282 and monitor 1284, of a temperature condition of the working end of the device. Accordingly, device 1201 includes a temperature-indicating element 1250 adapted to undergo a change in appearance in response to one or more pre-defined temperature conditions. As shown, temperature-indicating element 1250 includes a thermochromic unit 1252 having a thermochromic composition incorporated therein. Thermochromic compositions are well known in the art, and can be tailored or formulated, e.g., by chemical modification, such that one or more thermochromic transitions of the composition occur at defined temperature values. Typically, temperature-indicating element 1250 is disposed at the distal or working end of device 1201, at a location that is readily visualized by the surgeon via camera 1282 and monitor 1284. By observing the working end of device 1201, the surgeon can monitor a temperature condition adjacent to the target tissue. For example, power supplied from power supply 1228 to device 1201 can be adjusted according to the appearance of temperature indicating element 1250. Alternatively, if element 1250 indicates that a desired target temperature for the procedure has been achieved, treatment may be discontinued, thereby reducing the risk of thermal damage to underlying or adjacent, non-target tissue.",

Typically, element 1350 comprises a thermochromic composition, and is adapted to provide a visual indication to the surgeon of one or more temperature conditions at the working end of the device by undergoing at least one pre-defined thermochromic transition. The visual indication provided to the surgeon may indicate the progress (e.g., completion) of a procedure, and reduces the risk of an excessively high temperature condition at the surgical site. Accordingly, thermal damage to adjacent or underlying, non-target tissue may be avoided. For greater clarity, temperature-indicating element 1350 is depicted on the monitor image of FIG. 13. Temperature-indicating element 1350 may include various elements, features, and characteristics of temperature indicating elements described herein with reference to other embodiments of the invention.",

        "FIG. 14 illustrates a perspective view of a tissue treatment member or head 910 of another probe 900 having a temperature indicator 930. Tissue treatment member 910 has a generally annular or loop configuration.",
        "Tissue treatment member 910 includes an electrode support 904 extending from and connected to the distal end of shaft 902 of probe 900. Additionally, a base 916 may separate and further affix the support 904 to shaft 902. Support 904 supports an active electrode 906 and a return electrode 908 in a spaced apart relationship. The support may be made of an electrically non-conducting material such as, for example, ceramic or a plastic. In the illustrated embodiment, active electrode 906 has ends 906a extending into and through openings in support structure 904 to a power supply via one or more conducting members (not shown). Return electrode 908 is operatively connected to the power supply via one or more conducting members (not shown).",
        "Support 904 has an annular or circular configuration and a cavity or recess 914 within a tissue contacting surface 912 for holding active electrode 906. Preferably, active electrode 906 has a shape and configuration that allows it to cooperatively fit within recess 914. While the illustrated embodiment provides a support 904 and active electrode 906 as an annular, loop, ring or circular configuration, their respective shapes and that of recess 914 may vary widely, e.g., serpentine, rectangular, oblong, etc. Additionally, more than one cavity may be provided in the support wherein each cavity may support one or more electrodes. Active electrode 906 may be spaced a predetermined distance from the target tissue by properly pre-selecting the depth of the cavity 914 and the size, diameter or thickness of the electrode. Preferably, active electrode 906 is positioned such that a portion of its surface is flush with or just below the tissue-contacting surface 912 of support 904. In the particular variation illustrated, cavity 914 is provided at a depth on the inside top surface of support 904 and active electrode 906 has a diameter and a thickness such that, when active electrode 906 is operatively provided within cavity 914, tissue contacting surface 912 is substantially flush and smooth (or, as stated above, the active electrode may be positioned below or recessed within cavity 914). In addition to operative advantages, such a configuration serves to protect active electrode 906 from damage during surgery. Other variations are contemplated, for example, where cavity 914 and thus active electrode 906 seated therein are provided at a depth on the outer, top surface of support 904 or on a lateral or perimeter surface of support 904.",
        "As shown the probe 900 may also include a temperature indicator 930. Temperature indicator 930 may be as described above. It may have a band shape that extends circumferentially about the support 904. The band may be positioned within an annular gap such that the temperature indicator is flush with the electrode support tissue treatment surface. The temperature indicator may be divided into one or more discrete components or it may be continuous as shown.",
        "Return electrode 908 is provided about the perimeter, circumference or outer surface of support 904 such that support 904 is partially positioned or extends between active electrode 906 and return electrode 908. Similarly, return electrode 908 has a shape and configuration that allows it to fit about support 904. Such a support and electrode configuration provides structural robustness to both electrodes. While return electrode 906 has a clip or loop configuration in the illustrated embodiment, it may have any suitable configuration and position with respect to support 904 and active electrode 906. As shown return electrode 906 surrounds the body of the support 904 such that it is concentric with support 904 and active electrode 906, but has a width or height dimension which is less than that of support 904 such that return electrode 906 does not cover either the active (upper) or inactive (lower) portions of support 904. Accordingly, when treating tissue in a narrow space such that both the active and inactive sides of support 904 contact tissue, tissue at only the active side is ablated because the plasma generated as a result of the application of high frequency voltage via active electrode 906 does not extend to the lower side of support 904.",
        "Electrodes 906 and 908 may be made of any of the electrode materials previously mentioned. Preferably, active electrode 906 is made of a material of that which undergoes minimal oxidation and has a low electrical resistivity, e.g., tungsten or tantalum. Such materials result in an ablated tissue surface that is minimally discolored and has minimal thermal damage. Examples of materials which may be used for return electrode 908 are stainless steel, copper and alloys thereof. Optional additional features of support 904 include one or more cut-out or recessed regions 917 and one or more openings or apertures 918. More particularly, the tissue-contacting surface 912 is recessed in one or more locations 917 to facilitate fluid flow within cavity 914 and contact with active electrode 906. While the illustrated embodiment provides recessed regions 917 about the circumference of annular active electrode 906 that extend the thickness of support 904, such recessed regions may be located internally to the electrode's annulus or within the boundary of the electrode loop. Aperture 918 further facilitates fluid circulation about active electrode 906 to increase conductivity in the contacted tissue area. Additionally, opening 918 acts as a vent to prevent heat from accumulating adjacent to the tissue treatment surface as well as allows air or gas bubbles that are formed during ablation to escape from the tissue treatment zone. While only a single opening 918 positioned concentrically within the electrode loop is illustrated, multiple openings may be provided in any suitable pattern within the space defined by active electrode 906 or outside the perimeter or both.",
        "While the exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail, by way of example and for clarity of understanding, a variety of changes, adaptations, and modifications will be apparent to those of skill in the art. In addition, it is to be understood that certain elements or features of various disclosed embodiments may be substituted for corresponding or analogous elements or features of other disclosed embodiments, or may be combined with elements and features of other disclosed embodiments, without departing from the scope of the instant invention.
