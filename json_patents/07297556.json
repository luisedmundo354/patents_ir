        "Idiopathic nephrotic syndromes due to primary glomerular diseases include the minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS), the focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FGS), the membranous nephropathy (MN), and the membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). Patients with these diseases fall into hypoproteinemia due to the loss of substantial amounts of protein in the urine during the nephrotic stage, and in order to compensate for the loss, protein synthesis is accelerated in the liver.",
        "The four disease types above are finally diagnosed by taking a sample of the kidney (renal biopsy), and testing the sample with a light microscope and an electron microscope, and also testing the sample through the immunofluorescent antibody method. This diagnostic process is a large burden on the patient and requires time and labor for the histological examination.",
        "Therefore, there has been a demand for a diagnosis method for the nephrotic syndromes by using blood serum or urine, which are relatively easily available. The present invention aims at providing a new diagnosis method. Through this method, the patient can be relieved of the biopsy. At the same time, this method enables the distinction between the MCNS and the FGS, in which the clinical feature is similar to MCNS.",
        "The present invention provides, for the first time, sensitive and quick methods and kits that can be used as an aid for diagnosis of MCNS by measuring markers that are differentially present in samples of a MCNS patient and a subject who does not have MCNS (e.g., MN, FGS, IgA nephropathy, or MPGN patients). By monitoring the amount of one or more of these markers, the methods and kits of the invention can determine the subject's pathological status using minute quantities of crude samples. In particular, it has been found that alpha-2-HS glycoprotein beta chain, a protein detected from serum samples as a 5910 Da peak by SELDI mass spectrometry, is a marker for MCNS.",

The detectable moiety often generates a measurable signal, such as a radioactive, chromogenic, or fluorescent signal, that can be used to quantitate the amount of bound detectable moiety in a sample. The detectable moiety can be incorporated in or attached to a primer or probe either covalently, or through ionic, van der Waals or hydrogen bonds, e.g., incorporation of radioactive nucleotides, or biotinylated nucleotides that are recognized by streptavidin. The detectable moiety may be directly or indirectly detectable. Indirect detection can involve the binding of a second directly or indirectly detectable moiety to the detectable moiety. For example, the detectable moiety can be the ligand of a binding partner, such as biotin, which is a binding partner for streptavidin, or a nucleotide sequence, which is the binding partner for a complementary sequence, to which it can specifically hybridize. The binding partner may itself be directly detectable, for example, an antibody may be itself labeled with a fluorescent molecule. The binding partner also may be indirectly detectable, for example, a nucleic acid having a complementary nucleotide sequence can be a part of a branched DNA molecule that is in turn detectable through hybridization with other labeled nucleic acid molecules.

Thus, under designated immunoassay conditions, the specified antibodies bind to a particular protein at least two times the background and do not substantially bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample. Specific binding to an antibody under such conditions may require an antibody that is selected for its specificity for a particular protein. A variety of immunoassay formats may be used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a particular protein. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays are routinely used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein (see, e.g., Harlow & Lane, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual (1988), for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity).

        "In one embodiment of the detection method, a gas phase ion spectrometer can be used. This method comprises: (a) contacting a sample with a substrate comprising an adsorbent thereon under conditions to allow binding between a marker and the adsorbent; and (b) detecting the marker bound to the adsorbent by gas phase ion spectrometry.",
        "The detection of these markers can be enhanced using certain selectivity conditions (e.g., types of adsorbents used or washing solutions). In a preferred embodiment, the same or substantially the same selectivity conditions that were used to discover the markers can be used in the methods for detecting a marker in a sample. For example, a substrate comprising an adsorbent having a hydrophobic group and an anionic group (e.g., polystyrene latex beads functionalized with a sulfonate group) can be used. In another example, a substrate comprising an adsorbent having a hydrophobic group (e.g., an aliphatic C16 hydrocarbon group) can be used. In yet another example, a substrate comprising an adsorbent having a metal ion bound to a metal chelating group (e.g., nickel metal ions chelated by nitrilotriacetic acid groups) as adsorbents can be used. In some embodiments, an adsorbent can be antibodies that specifically bind to the markers. Preferably, a sample is serum taken from a subject.",
        "In one embodiment, a substrate comprising an adsorbent can be in the form of a probe, which is removably insertable into a gas phase ion spectrometer. For example, a substrate can be in the form of a strip with adsorbents on its surface. In another embodiment, a substrate comprising an adsorbent can be positioned onto another substrate to form a probe, which is removably insertable into a gas phase ion spectrometer. For example, a substrate comprising an adsorbent can be a solid phase, such as a polymeric or glass bead with a functional group for binding a marker, which can be subsequently positioned on a second substrate to form a probe. For example, the second substrate can be in the form of a strip, or a plate having a series of wells at a predetermined addressable locations. One advantage of this embodiment is that the marker can be adsorbed to the first substrate in one physical context, and transferred to the second substrate, which can then be submitted for analysis by gas phase ion spectrometry. The probe can be in any shape as long as it is removably insertable into a gas phase ion spectrometer.",
        "The probe can also be adapted for use with inlet systems and detectors of a gas phase ion spectrometer.

For example, the probe substrate material can include, but is not limited to, insulating materials (e.g., glass, ceramic), semi-insulating materials (e.g., silicon wafers), or electrically conducting materials (e.g., metals, such as nickel, brass, steel, aluminum, gold, or electrically conductive polymers), organic polymers, biopolymers, or any combinations thereof.",
        "The probe substrate surface can be conditioned to bind markers. For example, in one embodiment, the surface of the probe substrate can be conditioned (e.g., chemically or mechanically such as roughening) to place adsorbents on the surface. The adsorbent comprises functional groups for binding with a marker. In some embodiments, the substrate material itself can also contribute to adsorbent properties and may be considered part of an \u201cadsorbent.\u201d",

        "Adsorbents can be placed on the probe substrate in continuous or discontinuous patterns. If continuous, one or more adsorbents can be placed on the substrate surface. If multiple types of adsorbents are used, the substrate surface can be coated such that one or more binding characteristics vary in one or two-dimensional gradient. If discontinuous, plural adsorbents can be placed in predetermined addressable locations on the substrate surface. The addressable locations can be arranged in any pattern, but are preferably in regular pattern, such as lines, orthogonal arrays, or regular curves (e.g., circles). Each addressable location may comprise the same or different adsorbent.",
        "The probes can be produced using any suitable methods depending on the selection of substrate materials and/or adsorbents. For example, the surface of a metal substrate can be coated with a material that allows derivitization of the metal surface. More specifically, a metal surface can be coated with silicon oxide, titanium oxide or gold. Then surface can be derivatized with a bifunctional linker, one end of which can covalently bind with a functional group on the surface and the other end of which can be further derivatized with groups that function as an adsorbent. In another example, a porous silicon surface generated from crystalline silicon can be chemically modified to include adsorbents for binding markers. In yet another example, adsorbents with a hydrogel backbone can be formed directly on the substrate surface by in situ polymerizing a monomer solution which comprises, e.g., substituted acrylamide monomers, substituted acrylate monomers, or derivatives thereof comprising a functional group of choice as an adsorbent.",

Typically, the sample and the substrate comprising the adsorbent are contacted for a period of between about 30 seconds and about 12 hours, and preferably, between about 30 seconds and about 15 minutes.",
        "The temperature at which the sample contacts the probe substrate comprising an adsorbent can be a function of the particular sample and the selected probe. Typically, the sample is contacted to the probe substrate under ambient temperature and pressure conditions. For some samples, however, modified temperature (typically 4\u00b0 C. through 37\u00b0 C.), and pressure conditions can be desirable, which conditions are determinable by those skilled in the art.",
        "After the probe substrate comprising an adsorbent contacts the sample or sample solution, it is preferred that unbound materials on the probe substrate surface are washed out so that only the bound materials remain on the substrate surface. Washing a probe substrate surface can be accomplished by, e.g., bathing, soaking, dipping, rinsing, spraying, or washing the substrate surface with an eluant or a washing solution. A microfluidics process is preferably used when a washing solution such as an eluant is introduced to small spots of adsorbents on the probe. Typically, the washing solution can be at a temperature of between 0\u00b0 C. and 100\u00b0 C., preferably between 4\u00b0 C. and 37\u00b0 C.",
        "Any suitable washing solutions or eluants can be used to wash the probe substrate surface. For example, organic solutions or aqueous solutions can be used. Preferably, an aqueous solution is used. Exemplary aqueous solutions include a HEPES buffer, a Tris buffer, a phosphate buffered saline, etc. The selection of a particular washing solution or an eluant is dependent on other experimental conditions (e.g., types of adsorbents used or markers to be detected), and can be determined by those of skill in the art. For example, if a probe comprising a hydrophobic group and a sulfonate group as adsorbents is used, then an aqueous solution, such as a HEPES buffer, may be preferred. In another example, if a probe comprising a metal binding group as an adsorbent is used. then an aqueous solution, such as a phosphate buffered saline, may be preferred. In yet another example, if a probe comprising a hydrophobic group is used, then water may be preferred as a washing solution.",
        "Optionally, an energy absorbing molecule (e.g., in solution) can be applied to markers or other substances bound on the probe substrate surface. Spraying, pipetting, or dipping can be used. This can be done after unbound materials are washed off of the probe substrate surface. An energy absorbing molecule refers to a molecule that absorbs energy from an energy source in a gas phase ion spectrometer, thereby assisting desorption of markers or other substances from a probe surface. Exemplary energy absorbing molecules include cinnamic acid derivatives, sinapinic acid and dihydroxybenzoic acid.",
        "After the marker is bound to the probe, it is detected using gas phase ion spectrometry. Markers or other substances bound to the adsorbents on the probes can be analyzed using a gas phase ion spectrometer. This includes, e.g., mass spectrometers, ion mobility spectrometers, or total ion current measuring devices. The quantity and characteristics of the marker can be determined using gas phase ion spectrometry. Other substances in addition to the marker of interest can also be detected by gas phase ion spectrometry.",
        "In one embodiment, a mass spectrometer can be used to detect markers on the probe. In a typical mass spectrometer, a probe with a marker is introduced into an inlet system of the mass spectrometer. The marker is then ionized by an ionization source such as a laser, fast atom bombardment, or plasma. The generated ions are collected by an ion optic assembly, and then a mass analyzer disperses and analyzes the passing ions. The ions exiting the mass analyzer are detected by a detector. The detector then translates information of the detected ions into mass-to-charge ratios. Detection of the presence of a marker or other substances will typically involve detection of signal intensity. This, in turn, can reflect the quantity and character of a marker bound to the probe.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, a laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometer is used with the probe of the present invention. In laser desorption mass spectrometry, a probe with a bound marker is introduced into an inlet system. The marker is desorbed and ionized into the gas phase by laser from the ionization source. The ions generated are collected by an ion optic assembly, and then in a time-of-flight mass analyzer, ions are accelerated through a short high voltage field and let drift into a high vacuum chamber. At the far end of the high vacuum chamber, the accelerated ions strike a sensitive detector surface at a different time. Since the time-of-flight is a function of the mass of the ions, the elapsed time between ionization and impact can be used to identify the presence or absence of molecules of specific mass. As any person skilled in the art understands, any of these components of the laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometer can be combined with other components described herein in the assembly of mass spectrometer that employs various means of desorption, acceleration, detection, measurement of time, etc.",
        "In another embodiment, an ion mobility spectrometer can be used to detect and characterize a marker. The principle of ion mobility spectrometry is based on different mobility of ions. Specifically, ions of a sample produced by ionization move at different rates, due to their difference in, e.g., mass, charge, or shape, through a tube under the influence of an electric field. The ions (typically in the form of a current) are registered at the detector which can then be used to identify a marker or other substances in the sample. One advantage of ion mobility spectrometry is that it can operate at atmospheric pressure.",
        "In yet another embodiment, a total ion current measuring device can be used to detect and characterize markers. This device can be used when the probe has a surface chemistry that allows only-a single type of marker to be bound. When a single type of marker is bound on the probe, the total current generated from the ionized marker reflects the nature of the marker. The total ion current produced by the marker can then be compared to stored total ion current of known compounds. Characteristics of the marker can then be determined.",
        "Data generated by desorption and detection of markers can be analyzed with the use of a programmable digital computer. The computer program generally contains a readable medium that stores codes. Certain code can be devoted to memory that includes the location of each feature on a probe, the identity of the adsorbent at that feature and the elution conditions used to wash the adsorbent. Using this information, the program can then identify the set of features on the probe defining certain selectivity characteristics (e.g., types of adsorbent and eluants used). The computer also contains code that receives as input, data on the strength of the signal at various molecular masses received from a particular addressable location on the probe. This data can indicate the number of markers detected, optionally including the strength of the signal and the determined molecular mass for each marker detected.",
        "Data analysis can include the steps of determining signal strength (e.g., height of peaks) of a marker detected and removing \u201couterliers\u201d (data deviating from a predetermined statistical distribution). For example, the observed peaks can be normalized, a process whereby the height of each peak relative to some reference is calculated. For example, a reference can be background noise generated by instrument and chemicals (e.g., energy absorbing molecule) which is set as zero in the scale. Then the signal strength detected for each marker or other substances can be displayed in the form of relative intensities in the scale desired (e.g., 100). Alternatively, a standard may be admitted with the sample so that a peak from the standard can be used as a reference to calculate relative intensities of the signals observed for each marker or other markers detected.",
        "The computer can transform the resulting data into various formats for displaying. In one format, referred to as \u201cspectrum view or retentate map,\u201d a standard spectral view can be displayed, wherein the view depicts the quantity of marker reaching the detector at each particular molecular weight. In another format, referred to as \u201cpeak map,\u201d only the peak height and mass information are retained from the spectrum view, yielding a cleaner image and enabling markers with nearly identical molecular weights to be more easily seen. In yet another format, referred to as \u201cgel view,\u201d each mass from the peak view can be converted into a grayscale image based on the height of each peak, resulting in an appearance similar to bands on electrophoresis gels. In yet another format, referred to as \u201c3-D overlays,\u201d several spectra can be overlayed to study subtle changes in relative peak heights. In yet another format, referred to as \u201cdifference map view,\u201d two or more spectra can be compared, conveniently highlighting unique markers and markers which are up- or down-regulated between samples. Marker profiles (spectra) from any two samples may be compared visually.",
        "Using any of the above display formats, it can be readily determined from the signal display whether a diagnostic marker having a particular molecular weight (e.g., about 2955.3 Da (DA-1), 6116.6 Da (DA-2), 5910.0 Da (DA-3), 2962.5 Da (DB-1), 6130.8 Da (DB-2), or 3161.5 Da (DB-3)) is detected from a sample. Alternatively, it can be readily determined from the signal display whether a therapeutic marker having an apparent molecular weight of about 2952.3 Da (TA-1), 5910.0 Da (TA-2), 5922.6 Da (TB-1), 10224.4 Da (TB-2), 10793.3 Da (TB-3), 13672.1 Da (CA-1), 13980.1 Da (CA-2), 13895.6 Da (CA-3), 13788.5 Da (CA-4), or 13965.4 Da (CA-5) is detected from a sample. Moreover, from the strength of signals, the amount of diagnostic or therapeutic markers bound on the probe surface can be determined.",
        "B. Immunoassay Detection",
        "In another embodiment of the detection method, an immunoassay can be used to qualitatively or quantitatively detect and analyze diagnostic or therapeutic markers in a sample. This method comprises: (a) providing an antibody that specifically binds to a marker, wherein the marker is a polypeptide which is differentially present in samples of a MCNS patient and a subject who does not have MCNS (e.g., MN, FGS, IgA nephropathy, or MPGN patients) or is differentially present in a sample obtained from a patient before and after treatment; (b) contacting a sample with the antibody, and (c) detecting the presence of a complex of the antibody bound to the marker in the sample.",
        "To prepare an antibody that specifically binds to a marker, purified markers or their nucleic acid sequences can be used. Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for other markers can be obtained by further characterization of these markers. For example, each marker can be peptide mapped with a number of enzymes (e.g., trypsin, V8 protease, etc.). The molecular weights of digestion fragments from each marker can be used to search the databases, such as SwissProt database, for sequences that will match the molecular weights of digestion fragments generated by various enzymes. Using this method, the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of other markers can be identified if these markers are known proteins in the databases.",
        "Alternatively, the proteins can be sequenced using protein ladder sequencing. Protein ladders can be generated by, for example, fragmenting the molecules and subjecting fragments to enzymatic digestion or other methods that sequentially remove a single amino acid from the end of the fragment. Methods of preparing protein ladders are described, for example, in International Publication WO 93/24834 (Chait et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,792,664 (Chait et al.). The ladder is then analyzed by mass spectrometry. The difference in the masses of the ladder fragments identify the amino acid removed from the end of the molecule.",
        "If the markers are not known proteins in the databases, nucleic acid and amino acid sequences can be determined with knowledge of even a portion of the amino acid sequence of the marker. For example, degenerate probes can be made based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the marker. These probes can then be used to screen a genomic or cDNA library created from a sample from which a marker was initially detected. The positive clones can be identified, amplified, and their recombinant DNA sequences can be subcloned using techniques which are well known. See, e.g., Current Protocols for Molecular Biology (Ausbel et al., Green Publishing Assoc. and Wiley-Interscience 1989) and Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. (Sambrook el al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York 1989).",
        "Using the purified markers or their nucleic acid sequences, antibodies that specifically bind to a marker can be prepared using any suitable methods known in the art. See, e.g., Coligan, Current Protocols in Immunology (1991); Harlow & Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (1988); Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice (2d ed. 1986); and Kohler & Milstein, Nature 256:495-497 (1975). Such techniques include, but are not limited to, antibody preparation by selection of antibodies from libraries of recombinant antibodies in phage or similar vectors, as well as preparation of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies by immunizing rabbits or mice (see, e.g., Huse et al., Science 246:1275-1281 (1989); Ward et al., Nature 341:544-546 (1989)).",
        "After the antibody is provided, a marker can be detected and/or quantified using any of a number of well recognized immunological binding assays (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,366,2411 4,376,110; 4,517,288; and 4,837,168). Useful assays include, for example, an enzyme immune assay (EIA) such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a radioimmune assay (NA), a Western blot assay, or a slot blot assay. For a review of the general immunoassays, see also, Methods in Cell Biology: Antibodies in Cell Biology, volume 37 (Asai, ed. 1993); Basic and Clinical Immunology (Stites & Terr, eds., 7th ed. 1991); Harlow & Lane, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual (1988).",
        "Generally, a sample obtained from a subject can be contacted with the antibody that specifically binds the marker. Optionally, the antibody can be fixed to a solid support to facilitate washing and subsequent isolation of the complex, prior to contacting the antibody with a sample. Examples of solid supports include glass or plastic in the form of, e.g., a microtiter plate, a stick, a bead, or a microbead. Antibodies can also be attached to a probe substrate or ProteinChip\u00ae array described above. The sample is preferably a biological fluid sample taken from a subject. Examples of biological fluid samples include blood, serum, urine, semen, seminal fluid or tissue extracts. The sample can be diluted with a suitable eluant before contacting the sample to the antibody.",
        "After incubating the sample with antibodies, the mixture is washed and the antibody-marker complex formed can be detected. This can be accomplished by incubating the washed mixture with a detection reagent. This detection reagent may be, e.g., a second antibody which is labeled with a detectable label. Exemplary detectable labels include magnetic beads (e.g., DYNABEADS\u2122), fluorescent dyes, radiolabels, enzymes (e.g., horse radish peroxide, alkaline phosphatase and others commonly used in an ELISA), and colorimetric labels such as colloidal gold or colored glass or plastic beads. Alternatively, the marker in the sample can be detected using an indirect assay, wherein, for example, a second, labeled antibody is used to detect bound marker-specific antibody, and/or in a competition or inhibition assay wherein, for example, a monoclonal antibody which binds to a distinct epitope of the marker are incubated simultaneously with the mixture.",
        "Throughout the assays, incubation and/or washing steps may be required after each combination of reagents. Incubation steps can vary from about 5 seconds to several hours, preferably from about 5 minutes to about 24 hours. However, the incubation time will depend upon the assay format, marker, volume of solution, concentrations and the like. Usually the assays will be carried out at ambient temperature, although they can be conducted over a range of temperatures, such as 10\u00b0 C. to 40\u00b0 C.",
        "Immunoassays can be used to determine the presence or absence of a marker in a sample as well as the quantity of a marker in a sample. First, a test amount of a marker in a sample can be detected using the immunoassay methods described above. If a marker is present in the sample, it will form an antibody-marker complex with an antibody that specifically binds the marker under suitable incubation conditions described above. The amount of an antibody-marker complex can be determined by comparing to a standard. A standard can be, e.g., a known compound or another protein known to be present in a sample. As noted above, the test amount of marker need not be measured in absolute units, as long as the unit of measurement can be compared to a control.",
        "The methods for detecting these markers in a sample have many applications. For example, one or more markers can be measured to aid MCNS diagnosis or prognosis. For example, these diagnostic markers include polypeptides having an apparent molecular weight of about 2955.3 Da (DA-1), 6116.6 Da (DA-2), 5910.0 Da (DA-3), 2962.5 Da (DB-1), 6130.8 Da (DB-2), or 3161.5 Da (DB-3). In another example, the methods for detection of the markers can be used to monitor responses in a subject to MCNS therapeutic treatment For example, these therapeutic markers include polypeptides having an apparent molecular weight of about 2952.3 Da (TA-1), 5910.0 Da (TA-2), 5922.6 Da (TB-1), 10224.4 Da (TB-2), 10793.3 Da (TB-3), 13672.1 Da (CA-1), 13980.1 Da (CA-2), 13895.6 Da (CA-3), 13788.5 Da (CA-4), or 13965.4 Da (CA-5). In another example, the methods for detecting markers can be used to assay for and to identify compounds that modulate expression of these markers in vivo or in vitro.",
        "In another aspect, the invention provides methods for aiding a MCNS diagnosis using a marker which is differentially present in samples of a MCNS patient and a subject who does not have MCNS (e.g., a MN, FGS, IgA nephropathy, or MPGN patient). Any one or combination of markers described above can be used for aiding MCNS diagnosis. Compared to the current MCNS tests available, the present methods provide a quick and simple way to differentiate if a subject has MCNS or MN, FGS, IgA nephropathy, or MPGN, and thus aiding a MCNS diagnosis. The methods comprise: (a) determining a test amount of a marker in a sample from the subject; and (b) determining whether the test amount is a diagnostic amount consistent with a diagnosis of MCNS.",
        "In step (a), a test amount of a marker in a sample from a subject is determined. Any suitable samples can be obtained from a subject. Preferably, a sample is a biological fluid sample taken from a subject being tested. Examples of biological fluid samples include blood, serum, urine, semen, seminal fluid or tissue extracts. Moreover, testing a serum sample does not require an invasive procedure, such as a biopsy.",
        "After a sample is obtained, any suitable method can be used to determine a test amount of the marker in a sample from a subject being tested. For example, gas phase ion spectrometry or an immunoassay can be used.",
        "In one embodiment, gas phase ion spectrometry can be used to determine a test amount of a marker in a sample from a subject. First, one or more markers can be detected with gas phase ion spectrometry using the methods described above. After the marker is detected by a gas phase ion spectrometer, the test amount of marker can be determined. For example, a signal is displayed at the molecular weight of the marker of interest. Based on the strength or magnitude of the displayed signal, the amount of marker in a sample being tested can be determined. It is noted that the test amount of marker in a sample need not be measured in absolute units, but can be in relative units as long as it can be compared qualitatively or quantitatively to a control amount of a marker. For example, as described above, the amount of the marker detected can be displayed in terms of relative intensity based on the background noise. Preferably, the test amount and the control amount of markers are measured under the same conditions.",
        "If desired, the absolute amount of a marker can be determined by calibration. From the peak intensity vs. concentration plot, the absolute amount of a marker in any sample being tested can be determined.",
        "In another embodiment, an immunoassay can be used to determine a test amount of a marker in a sample from a subject. First, a test amount of a marker in a sample can be detected using the immunoassay methods described above. If a marker is present in the sample, it will form all antibody-marker complex with an antibody that specifically binds the marker under suitable incubation conditions described above. The amount of an antibody-marker complex can be determined by comparing to a standard. As noted above, the test amount of marker need not be measured in absolute units, as long as the unit of measurement can be compared to a control amount.",
        "After a test amount of marker is determined using either method, then based on the test amount, it can be determined whether a subject has MCNS. This determination can be made by any suitable methods. For example, the test amount can be compared to a control amount which can be a value or a range of values determined as follows.",
        "In one embodiment, the control amount can be an amount of a marker present in comparable samples from MN, FGS, IgA nephropathy, or MPGN patients. The control amount is measured under the same or substantially similar experimental conditions as in measuring the test amount. For example, if a test sample is obtained from a subject's serum and a marker is detected using a particular probe, then a control amount of the marker is preferably determined from a serum sample of a MN, FGS, IgA nephropathy, or MPGN patient using the same probe. It is preferred that the control amount of marker is determined based upon a significant number of samples from subjects who do not have MCNS (e.g., MN, FGS, IgA nephropathy, or MPGN patients) so that it reflects variations of the marker amounts in that population. If the test amount of marker is significantly increased compared to the control amount of marker which is known to be elevated in samples of MCNS patients (e.g., 5753 Da), then it can be a positive indication that a subject being tested has MCNS. For example, if the test amount is increased by 1.5 fold, preferably by 2 fold, more preferably by 5 fold, or most preferably by 10 fold compared to the control amount, then the test amount is a diagnostic amount which is consistent with a diagnosis of MCNS. The converse would apply for markers that are known to be elevated in the samples of MN, FGS, IgA nephropathy, or MPGN patients than MCNS patients (e.g., 3600 Da).",
        "In another embodiment, a control amount can be an amount of a marker present in comparable samples from a MCNS patient. Again, it is preferred that the control amount of a marker is determined based upon a significant number of samples taken from MCNS patients so that it reflects variations of the marker amounts in that population. If the test amount of the marker is about the same as the control amount of the marker, then it can be a positive indication that a subject being tested has MCNS.",
        "In yet another embodiment, a control amount can be an mount of a marker present in comparable samples from a normal person (i.e., who is known to be free of MCNS and MN, FGS, IgA nephropathy, or MPGN). It is preferred that the control amount of marker is determined based upon a significant number of samples taken from normal persons so that it reflects variations of the marker amounts in that population. If the control amount of a particular marker is significantly lower than the amount of the same marker present in comparable samples of MCNS patients, then this marker can be used to diagnose MCNS and rule out MN, FGS, IgA nephropathy, or MPGN in a single test. In such a case, if the test amount of marker is significantly increased compared to the control amount of marker, then it can be a positive indication that a subject being tested has MCNS. For example, if the test amount is increased by 1.5 fold, preferably by 2 fold, more preferably by 5 fold, most preferably by 10 fold compared to the control amount, then the test amount is a diagnostic amount which is consistent with a diagnosis of MCNS. The converse would apply for markers that are known to be elevated in the samples of MN, FGS, IgA nephropathy, or MPGN patients than MCNS patients.",
        "Data generated by mass spectrometry can then be analyzed by a computer software. The software can comprise code that converts signal from the mass spectrometer into computer readable form. The software also can include code that applies an algorithm to the analysis of the signal to determine whether the signal represents a \u201cpeak\u201d in the signal corresponding to a marker of this invention, or other useful markers. The software also can include code that executes an algorithm that compares signal from a test sample to a typical signal characteristic of \u201cnormal\u201d and MCNS and determines the closeness of fit between the two signals. The software also can include code indicating which the test sample is closest to, thereby providing a probable diagnosis.",
        "In yet another aspect, the invention provides kits for aiding a diagnosis of MCNS, wherein the kits can be used to detect the markers of the present invention. For example, the kits can be used to detect any one or combination of markers described above, which markers are differentially present in samples of a MCNS patient and a MN, FGS, IgA nephropathy, or MPGN patient. The kits may be used to detect any one or a combination of markers, which markers are differentially present in samples obtained from a patient before and after treatment. The kits of the invention have many applications. For example, the kits can be used to differentiate if a subject has MCNS or MN, FGS, IgA nephropathy, or MPGN, thus aiding a MCNS diagnosis. In another example, the kits can be used to determine if a patient is responding to treatment. In another example, the kits can be used to identify compounds that modulate expression of the markers in in vivo animal models for MCNS.",

Such kits can be prepared from the materials described above, and the previous discussion of these materials (e.g., probe substrates, adsorbents, washing solutions, etc.) is fully applicable to this section and need not be repeated.",

        "The Immobilized Metal Affinity Capture array, called \u201cIMAC3\u201d arrays (Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc., Fremont, Calif. USA), can be used to capture molecules that bind divalent cationic metals such as nickel, gallium, copper and zinc. The active spots contain nitrilotriacetic acid groups on the surface that chelate the metal ions. Proteins applied to the chip surface may bind to the chelated metal ion through histidine, tryptophan, cysteine, and phosphorylated amino acids.",
        "Since IMAC3 chips are manufactured in a metal-free form, IMAC3-Cu chips were prepared as follows. Each spot was outlined using a hydrophobic pen and allowed to dry. The chip was then assembled in the bioprocessor. After loading 50 \u03bcl of 100 mM copper sulfate to each spot, the chip was shaken for 5 minutes, the excess copper was removed with running deionized water, and the chip was shaken for 5 minutes with an excess of 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4. The chip was further rinsed under running deionized water. Binding buffer (PBS) was applied to each spot and shaken for 5 min. The surface was wiped dry around the spots and removed excess buffer without touching the active surface. IMAC3-Cu comprising a chelated copper metal ion as an adsorbent was thus prepared.",
