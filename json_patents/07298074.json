        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an image forming device, such as a display using an electron beam and, more specifically, to an image forming device including spacers.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "A known image forming device using an electron emitter is a flat display panel. The known flat display panel comprises an electron source substrate including a plurality of cold cathode electron emitters and an anode substrate including an anode electrode and phosphors. The electron source substrate and anode substrate are disposed parallel to each other. A vacuum is generated between the electron source substrate and the anode substrate. Generally known cold cathode electron emitters are surface-conduction type emitters, field electron emission (FE) type emitters, and metal-insulator-metal (MIM) type emitters. The flat display panel including known cold cathode electron emitters is light-weight and has a large display area compared to other widely used CRTs. Moreover, the flat display panel is brighter and is capable of displaying higher quality images compared to other flat display panels using liquid crystal and flat display panels such as plasma displays and electroluminescent displays.",
        "In general, the above-described image forming device comprises a face plate and a rear plate facing each other. The face plate is the display surface for displaying an image. The face plate includes a metal back, which receives an acceleration voltage Va, and a fluorescent film. The rear plate is the electron source for generating light from the phosphors. The rear plate includes cold cathode electron emitters and wires, wherein the wires electrically connect the electron emitters and run in the longitudinal and horizontal directions. Sidewalls seal the circumference of the face plate and the rear plate, forming a vacuum vessel. Spacers are interposed between the face plate and the rear plate to maintain the plates apart from each other at a predetermined distance and to support the plates against atmospheric pressure. The spacers are usually interposed between and are in contact with the conductor of the rear plate (e.g., the wires in the horizontal direction) and the electrode on the face plate (e.g., the metal back) (for example, refer to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,614,781 and 5,742,117 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 08-180821).",
        "In such an image forming device, sometimes the spacers emit a secondary electron when a part of an electron beam or a reflected electron strikes the surface. This secondary electron generates an electric potential in the area where the secondary electron was emitted from. Accordingly, the electric potential distribution at the spacer and the vicinity is distorted. As a result, not only the trajectory of the electron beam becomes unstable but also an electric discharge will occur inside the image forming device.",
        "To prevent electrical charging of the spacers, the spacers may be formed of an insulating substrate covered with a high-resistance film, which is capable of preventing electrical charging. This method of preventing electrical charging is disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,614,781 and 5,742,117 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 08-180821.",
        "The inventors propose a more preferable method for preventing electrical charging of spacers in which spacers formed of an insulating substrate covered with a high-resistance film are disposed intermittently in contact with the conductors on the rear plate (refer to Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-136741).",
        "However, when the contact area of the spacer actually in contact with the conductor is small in comparison with the surface area (including the contact area) that faces the conductor, electrical currents are converged (or, in other words, current crowding occurs) at the edge of the contact area. This current crowding occurs, for example, when the spaces contact the conductors intermittently, as described above, or when the thickness (width) of the planer spacers is greater than the width of the conductors in contact.",
        "FIG. 11 illustrates the latter case in which the contact area of a spacer 1020 contacting a conductor (horizontal wire 1013) on a rear plate 1015 or an electrode (metal back 1019) on a face plate 1017 is smaller than the area of the surface including the contact area. In such a case, current crowding occurs at the edges of the contact area (points b in the drawing). Due to current crowding, heat is generated locally at the points b and the vicinity. Therefore, depending on the type of material used for a high-resistance film 1001, the property of the film (such as resistance) may change when the high-resistance film 1001 is used for a long period of time (i.e., when Va is applied for a long period of time). As a result, the electric field in the vicinity of the spacer 1020 is distorted, causing the formed images to be distorted. FIG. 11 also illustrates an insulating substrate 1000, a fluorescent film 1018, a longitudinal wire 1014, and an insulating layer 1021.",
        "Current crowding that occurs at some of the edges of the high-resistance film even when the high-resistance film is disposed on the edge of the spacer, as illustrated in FIG. 11, is known to be caused by the relationship of electric properties between the high-resistance film on the side of the spacer, the film on the edge of the spacer, and the conductor in contact with the spacer in addition to the above-described case in which the contact area of the spacer is only partially in contact with the rear plate or the face plate contact. When the entire end surface of the spacer is a contact area, it is desired to effectively use the entire high-resistance film on the end surface as a current path.",
        "The present invention has taken into consideration the above mentioned problems, and its main object is to provide a panel for an image forming device, such as a planer display panel including cold cathode electron emitters, in which images are not distorted even when the panel is used for a long period of time.",
        "According to the present invention, a spacer has a first high-resistance film on an exposed surface and a second high-resistance film on a surface contacting a rear plate or a face plate. When this spacer contacts the rear plate or the face plate through a third high-resistance film, local current crowding is prevented from occurring at the contact area and the vicinity of the high-resistance films. As a result, a local change in resistance at the contact area of the high-resistance film can be prevented. Accordingly, an image forming device capable of stably maintaining an excellent image having high brightness for a long period of time is provided.",
        "An image forming device comprises a rear plate having a conductor set to a low voltage, a face plate having an electrode set to a high voltage, the face plate facing the rear plate, and a spacer electrically connected to the conductor and the electrode. The spacer comprises an insulating substrate having a first end surface facing the rear plate, a second end surface facing the electrode, and side surfaces connecting the first end surface and the second end surface, a first high-resistance film covering the side surfaces of the insulating substrate, and a second high-resistance film covering at least one of the first end surface and the second end surface of the insulating substrate and having a sheet resistance greater than or equal to a sheet resistance of the first high-resistance film. In the image forming device, the spacer and the conductor and the electrode are electrically connected via a third high-resistance film interposed between the conductor or the electrode and the second high-resistance film. Moreover, the resistivity \u03c12 and the film thickness t2 of the second high-resistance film and the resistivity \u03c13 and the film thickness t3 of the third high-resistance film satisfy the formulae below:",

In other words, local current crowding on the second high-resistance film 102 can be alleviated when Formulae 4 are satisfied. In this way, quality (resistance) of the second high-resistance film 102 can be prevented from being altered locally due to a long-term application of a voltage. Furthermore, image distortion caused by the change in film quality at the spacer 120 and its vicinity can be prevented. Prevention of local current crowding according to the present invention will now be described below.",
        "The current flow in the display panel having a structure according to the present invention and the current flow in a structure not according to the present invention are described below.",
        "FIG. 12 is schematic view of the current flow at the edge of the spacer in the display panel according to the present invention. In comparison with FIG. 12, FIG. 13 is a schematic view of the current flow at the edge of a spacer in a display panel not having a third high-resistance film 103. In comparison with FIG. 12, FIG. 14 is a schematic view of the current flow at the edge of the spacer in the display panel wherein the sheet resistance of the second high-resistance film is smaller than the sheet resistance of the first high-resistance film. The same components illustrated in FIGS. 12 to 14 are represented by the same reference numerals. FIGS. 12 to 14 include a spacer substrate (insulating substrate) 2100, a first high-resistance film 2101, a second high-resistance film 2102, a third high-resistance film 2103, a wiring electrode 2113, and a current crowding region 2130. The arrows in the drawings represent the flow of electricity. In the case illustrated in FIG. 13, the current flowing through the first high-resistance film 2101 at the edge of the spacer 2100 flows toward the wiring electrode 2113 via a pathway in the second high-resistance film 2102 having the smallest resistance because the sheet resistance of the second high-resistance film 2102 is greater than or equal to the first high-resistance film 2101. As a result, the current flows through a pathway having the shortest distance to the wiring electrode, as illustrated in the schematic view of FIG. 13. Consequently, this current flow generates a current crowding region 2130. In the case illustrated in FIG. 14, the current flowing through the first high-resistance film 2101 disperses in the second high-resistance film 2102 at the edge of the spacer 2100 because the sheet resistance of the second high-resistance film 2102 is smaller than the sheet resistance of the first high-resistance film 2101. More specifically, since the difference in sheet resistance causes the voltage drop in the second high-resistance film 2102 to be smaller than the voltage drop in the first high-resistance film 2101, the second high-resistance film 2102 appears to function as an electrode and, thus, the electric current disperses in the second high-resistance film 2102. Consequently, as illustrated in the schematic view of FIG. 14, the electric current disperses uniformly within the second high-resistance film 2102, and current crowding is alleviated compared to the case illustrated in FIG. 13. However, a current crowding region 2130 is still present. On the other hand, in the case of the structure according to the present invention illustrated in FIG. 12, the sheet resistance of the second high-resistance film 2102 is greater than or equal to the sheet resistance of the first high-resistance film 2101, and the relationship between the second high-resistance film 2102 and the third high-resistance film 2103 satisfies the above-mentioned Formulae 4. Hence, the current flowing through the first high-resistance film 2101 is slowly dispersed in the second high-resistance film 2102. More specifically, since the second high-resistance film 2102 and the third high-resistance film 2103 have a relationship represented by Formulae 4, even though the second high-resistance film 2102 does not function as an electrode for the first high-resistance film 2101 because the sheet resistance of the second high-resistance film 2102 is greater than or equal to the sheet resistance of the first high-resistance film 2101, the second high-resistance film 2102 appears to function as an electrode for the third high-resistance film 2103. Hence, the current flowing from the first high-resistance film 2101 to the second high-resistance film 2102 is dispersed in the second high-resistance film 2102 while receiving a downward force in the Y direction. Therefore, current crowding due to a sudden dispersion, such as that illustrated in FIG. 14, does not occur. Moreover, unlike the case illustrated in FIG. 13, current crowding does not occur even though the current is dispersed in the second high-resistance film 2102 and flows through a pathway having the shortest distance from the third high-resistance film 2103 to the wires. The reason the relationship between the first high-resistance film 2101 and the second high-resistance film 2102 is defined by using sheet resistance is because the important components of the currents flowing through the first high-resistance film 2101 and the second high-resistance film 2102 are the components orthogonal to the thickness directions of the first high-resistance film and the second high-resistance film.",
        "Next, Formulae 4 are explained.",
        "The electric potential difference in the thickness direction of the second high-resistance film 102 is used as an index for current crowding. This will now be described with reference to FIG. 5.",
        "FIG. 5 is an enlarged view of one of points a and the vicinity indicated in FIG. 2. The components in FIG. 5 are represented by the same reference numerals as in FIG. 2. The electric potential between two points a and a\u2032 on a line extending orthogonally from the rear plate 115 or the face plate 117 (refer to FIGS. 1 and 2) and passing through the edge point of the contact area of the third high-resistance film 103 and the horizontal wire 113 is measured. When the potential difference is large, the current flow in the thickness direction of the film (i.e., Y direction in FIG. 5) is large. Therefore, excessive current crowding occurs at the edge of the contact area. On the other hand, when the potential difference is small, the current flow in the film surface direction (i.e., X direction in FIG. 5) is great. Therefore, current crowding at the edge of the contact area is moderate.",
        "FIG. 6 is a graph indicating the proportion of the potential difference of a-a\u2032 in FIG. 5 (corresponding to a case in which the third high-resistance film 103 (refer to FIG. 2) is provided) to the potential difference of the same points a-a\u2032 for a case in which the third high-resistance film 103 is not provided. This proportion is dependent on the resistivity ratio (\u03c13/\u03c12). The values for each different film thickness ratio (t3/t2) are plotted on separate lines representing each film thickness ratio. The horizontal axis of the graph represents the resistivity ratio (\u03c13/\u03c12), and the vertical axis represents the proportion of the potential difference (the potential difference of a case in which the third high-resistance film 103 is provided compared to a case in which the third high-resistance film 103 is not provided).",
        "The area near 100% in the graph of FIG. 6 represents conditions in which the third high-resistance film 103 (refer to FIG. 2) is mostly ineffective for preventing current crowding. The points representing the relationship between the resistivity ratio and the film thickness observed in FIG. 6 when the proportion of the potential difference clearly starts to decrease from 100% (i.e., the critical points (inflection points) where the proportion starts to suddenly decrease) are extracted and re-plotted as a graph of resistivity ratio (vertical axis) over film thickness ratio (horizontal axis), as illustrated in FIG. 8. FIG. 8 is a graph representing a condition in which current crowding can be prevented by using the third high-resistance film 103 at the edge of the contact area. The condition represented here satisfies Formulae 4.",
        "According to the graph in FIG. 6, as the proportion of current crowding (the ratio of the potential differences of a case in which the third high-resistance film 103 is provided to a case in which the third high-resistance film 103 is not provided) approaches 0%, a double-digit improvement in current crowding prevention is observed. The points representing the relationship between the resistivity ratio and the film thickness observed in FIG. 6 when the decrease in the proportion of the potential difference suddenly becomes moderate as 0% is approached (i.e., the critical points (inflection points) where the decrease in proportion slows down) are extracted and re-plotted on a graph of resistivity ratio (vertical axis) over film thickness ratio (horizontal axis), as illustrated in FIG. 7. By plotting the relationship between the film thickness (horizontal axis) and the resistivity ratio (vertical axis), FIG. 7 represents the conditions in which current crowding is effectively prevented (improved) by the use of the third high-resistance film 103 (refer to FIG. 2).

        "The thickness of the third high-resistance film 103 (refer to FIG. 2) should preferably be in the range from 10\u22128 m to 10\u22125 m. Although the resistance depends on the surface energy of the material, the adhesiveness of the film to the substrate, and the substrate temperature, in general, when the thickness of the third high-resistance film 103 is 10\u22128 m or more, the film is formed in patches. Therefore the resistance becomes unstable and difficult to reproduce. When the film thickness is 10\u22125 m or more, film stress is increased, causing an increase in the possibility of the film being peeled off. Moreover, when the film thickness is 10\u22125 m or more, more time is required for deposition and, thus, productivity decreases. Accordingly, by taking into consideration these upper and lower limits, it is concluded that the preferable film thickness ratio t3/t2 of the second high-resistance film 102 to the third high-resistance film 103 is between 0.001 and 1,000.

The sheet resistance of the spacer 120 is set in a preferable range according to the ability of preventing electrical charging and electric power consumption. When the ability of preventing electrical charging is taken into consideration, it is preferable for the sheet resistance to be 1014 \u03a9/sq or lower. The lower limit of the sheet resistance depends on the shape of the spacer 120 and the voltage applied to the spacer 120. However, the sheet resistance should preferably be at least 107 \u03a9/sq.

The resistivity of the second high-resistance film 102 and the third high-resistance film 103 should preferably be in the rage of 0.1 to 108 \u03a9m.
