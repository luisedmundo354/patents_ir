        "The present application claims priority from Japanese patent application P2005-57734 filed on Mar. 2, 2005, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.",
        "This invention relates to a technique of transporting with retaining temperature, and more particularly to a technique of transporting living tissues such as cultured cells.",
        "In transporting medical instruments that contain cell tissues, such as artificially cultured skin or cornea or living tissues taken for inspections, JP 2004-217290 A discloses that transports the medical instruments while keeping the temperature within a predetermined range to avoid damage to the cells (for example, see Patent Document 1). In this technique, medical instruments that contain living tissues are placed in a container having a thermal insulation function and a thermal storage function or having a warming function, and transported with their temperature kept within a predetermined range. A temperature recording device for recording the temperature in the container is provided in order to secure the temperature during the transportation.",
        "With the related technique, checking, after transportation, to see whether the predetermined temperature range has been kept requires making a judgment by referring to the results recorded by the temperature recording device, which involves labor and time.",
        "Also, with the related technique, if a mistake is made during the process of putting a large number of medical instruments in a single container for transportation, e.g., when a wrong medical instrument is mistakenly put in the container instead of the correct one, the provision of the mistakenly delivered medical instrument cannot be recognized until the container arrives at the destination of delivery and is checked for identification. Particularly, with medical instruments used for a surgical operation of a particular patient, for example, it is necessary to prove that the medical instruments delivered to the destination medical facility are the right products for the patient, but the conventional example just ensures the retainment of temperature of the living tissues and proving the correctness of the delivered products is difficult.",
        "This invention has been made to solve the problems above, and an object of this invention is, in transportation of medical instruments including living tissues, to easily and quickly prove the quality during the transportation and to prove the correctness of the individual medical instruments.",
        "An embodiment of this invention relates to a method of transporting living tissues contained in a container retaining temperature, which includes the steps of: putting the living tissues in a first container including a first storage for storing a predetermined first identifier and a first IC tag including a first temperature sensor for measuring temperature and a radio communication mechanism; putting the first container in a second container including a second storage capable of storing the first identifier of the first IC tag and a second IC tag including a second temperature sensor for measuring temperature and a radio communication mechanism; storing a copy of the first identifier of the first IC tag in the second storage before beginning transportation of the living tissues; putting the second container in a third container having the temperature retaining function; transporting the third container; causing a controller provided in the third container to communicate with the first IC tag and the second IC tag being transported to read the temperatures from the first temperature sensor and the second temperature sensor; and writing information indicating an occurrence of a temperature abnormality to the first storage of the first IC tag and the second storage of the second IC tag when one of the temperatures read from the first temperature sensor and the second temperature sensor is out of a predetermined temperature range.",
        "When the abnormality occurs, an indicator provided in the third container indicates abnormality occurrence information, and when no abnormality occurs, the indicator indicates the temperature of the first temperature sensor or the second temperature sensor.",
        "After the completion of the transportation, the first container and the second container are disposed of together with the first IC tag and the second IC tag.",
        "Thus, according to the embodiment of this invention, before transportation, the identifier of the first IC tag is copied to the second IC tag of the second container for accommodating the first container, and after the transportation, the first identifier copied to the second IC tag is compared with the first identifier read from the first IC tag of the first container, whereby the correctness of the delivered living tissues is proved very easily and quickly.",
        "When a temperature abnormality occurs in the first or second container during the transportation of the living tissues, the indicator indicates the contents of the abnormality. Accordingly, by visually checking the indicator, whether there is an abnormality or not can be known very quickly and easily before the first or second container is taken out from the third container.",
        "Also, because the first and second containers having the first and second IC tags attached thereto are disposed of after use, the containers are kept in a sanitary condition and overwriting of identifiers caused by reuse is avoided, whereby reliabilities are ensured both in sanitation and information (correctness) aspects. Furthermore, because the first and second containers that are disposed of after use are just provided with the first and second IC tags, highly reliable services are offered at suppressed transportation costs.",

        "As shown in FIG. 1, a carrying container for transportation (a first container) 1, which is shaped like a laboratory dish, is used to accommodate a medical instrument 11, such as a solution or gel including living tissues like cultured cells or a specimen. A label-like passive IC tag 10 is attached to the cover 1A of the carrying container for transportation 1, where the passive IC tag 10 includes a memory that previously stores a unique identifier (a first identifier) and a temperature sensor for measuring the temperature of the carrying container for transportation 1 (the passive IC tag 10 is hereinafter referred to also as a passive IC tag with temperature sensor, a radio IC tag, or an IC tag). The carrying container for transportation 1 is used as a disposable container that is thrown away without removing the attached IC tag 10 at the destination of delivery after being used for transportation once.",
        "The carrying container for transportation 1 is put in a disk-like individual carrying container 2 (a second container). The individual carrying container 2 is a container for accommodating a plurality of carrying containers for transportation 1.

The passive IC tag with temperature sensor 20 with a temperature sensor, attached to the individual carrying container 2, has a previously set unique identifier (a second identifier). The individual carrying container 2 is used as a disposable container that is thrown away without removing the attached IC tag 20 at the destination of delivery after being used for transportation once.",
        "The individual carrying container 2 is made of, e.g., styrene foam having good thermal insulation ability, and it has an internal structure (e.g., recesses) for holding the carrying containers for transportation 1 so as to prevent the carrying containers for transportation 1 from coming off the individual carrying container 2 during transportation.",
        "As will be described later, information is written to and read from the passive IC tag with temperature sensor 20 using a reader/writer for IC tag 6 and a computer 60, where, with the individual carrying container 2 placed on the reader/writer for IC tag 6, identifiers etc. are read from the passive IC tags with temperature sensors 10 of the carrying containers for transportation 1 accommodated in the individual carrying container 2, and are written to the passive IC tag with temperature sensor 20 of the individual carrying container 2.",
        "The individual carrying container 2 is put in a cylindrically-shaped transportation container for constant temperature 3. The transportation container for constant temperature 3 is a cylindrical container for accommodating a plurality of individual carrying containers 2 in a stack, and includes a thermal insulation member and a thermal storage member as described later, so as to retain the temperature of the carrying containers for transportation 1 in the individual carrying containers 2. For example, the thermal insulation member provides thermal insulation from the outside, and the thermal storage member internally keeps the living tissues in the carrying containers for transportation 1 at constant temperature (e.g., around human body temperature).",
        "The transportation container for constant temperature 3 (a third container) has a controller 30 shown in FIG. 2 that reads and writes information to and from the passive IC tags with temperature sensors 10, 20 attached to the carrying containers for transportation 1 and individual carrying containers 2 accommodated inside. Also, an indicator 31 is provided in the cover 3A of the transportation container for constant temperature 3 to indicate conditions of the carrying containers for transportation 1 and presence/absence of abnormalities, for example.",
        "While the transportation container for constant temperature 3 can alone be used for the purpose of transportation this embodiment describes an example which uses a carrying container 4 to hold a plurality of transportation containers for constant temperature 3 in order to transport a larger number of carrying containers for transportation 1.",
        "The carrying container 4 (a fourth container) is shaped like a box in appearance and has cylindrical recesses for holding a plurality of transportation containers for constant temperature 3. The carrying container 4 includes a thermal insulation member to thermally insulate the plurality of individual carrying containers 2 from the outside.",
        "Also, the carrying container 4 has a controller 40 shown in FIG. 2, that sends and receives information to and from the controller 30 of the transportation container for constant temperature 3 placed inside.

In other words, the containers to which the medical instruments 11, containing solution or gel, or living tissues, may attach because of vibrations during transportation are disposed of after use, in order to keep the containers in a sanitary condition. The passive IC tags with temperature sensors 10 attached to the carrying containers for transportation 1 and the passive IC tags with temperature sensors 20 attached to the individual carrying containers 2 are also used as disposable parts. Because the passive IC tags with temperature sensors 10, 20 store the identifiers of the medical instruments 11 or living tissues, past data on a management server 5 at the control center may be overwritten with different pieces of data if the identifiers are not erased when the passive IC tags with temperature sensors 10, 20 are reused. Accordingly, the carrying containers for transportation 1 and the individual carrying containers 2, with the passive IC tags with temperature sensors 10, 20 having temperature sensors, are disposed of after use, whereby the containers are kept in a sanitary condition and overwriting of identifiers is avoided, thus ensuring reliabilities in both sanitation and information aspects.",

The controller 40 of the carrying container 4 also has a position detecting device for detecting the present position by using Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites or the mobile communication network, and the sender of the medical instruments 11 and the medical facility that receives the medical instruments 11 are capable of obtaining information about the conditions and present position of the medical instruments 11 being transported, by making inquiries to the management server 5.",

When the measured value is out of the predetermined temperature range, it is judged that an abnormality of outside temperature has occurred and goes to step S23. On the other hand, when the measured temperature value is within the predetermined temperature range, it is judged that the temperature outside of the cover 3A is normal and goes to step S24.",
        "When it is detected that the temperature outside of the cover 3A becomes out of predetermined temperature range, in step S23, an \u201coutside temperature abnormality flag\u201d in the memory 312 is turned \u201cON\u201d and the time when the out of the temperature range is detected is recorded. When the flag is already ON, the first abnormality is recorded without making a new record.",
        "Next, in step S24, the remaining battery power (voltage) read from the sensor for remaining battery power 305 is compared with a predetermined voltage value. When the measured value is below the predetermined voltage value, it is judged that an abnormality of remaining battery power has occurred and goes to step S25. On the other hand, when the measured voltage value is over the predetermined voltage, it is judged that the remaining battery power of the battery 313 is normal and goes to step S26.",

When the detected value indicates \u201copen\u201d, it is judged that an abnormality has occurred, i.e., the cover 3A opened during the transportation, and goes to step S29. On the other hand, when the detected value from the sensor for cover open and shut 306 indicates \u201cclose\u201d (e.g., OFF), it is judged that the cover 3A is in the normal condition and goes to step S30.",

Also, when abnormality information is recorded in the abnormality flags, the data is sent to the controller 40 of the carrying container 4 through the output terminal for external data 303.",
        "On the other hand, when all abnormality flags are OFF, the indicator 31 indicates the present temperature of the carrying containers for transportation 1 or individual carrying containers 2.",

        "The controller 30 writes abnormality information to the IC tags 10 and 20 in the four kinds of recording modes shown below. They are previously set for each transportation container for constant temperature 3 (a switch may be provided to select the recording modes).",
        "(D-1) No record mode: Nothing is recorded.",
        "(D-2) All record mode: All sensor information is recorded.

Then, according to the flowchart of FIG. 9, the sensors are driven periodically (e.g., once in every five minutes) using an interval timer, which is not shown in the sensor controller 410, and the sensor controller 410 reads the measurements from the sensors. The sensor values are then checked for abnormalities. As for the value measured by the sensor for acceleration 407 and the value detected by the sensor for cover open and shut 406, the sensor controller 410 stores the values in the memory 412 only for a predetermined time period (e.g., for five minutes).",

It should be noted that the priority of abnormality information is the same as that of the controller 30 of the transportation container for constant temperature 3.",
        "On the other hand, when all abnormality flags are OFF, the indicator 41 indicates the present temperature of the carrying containers for transportation 1 or the individual carrying containers 2.",

Also, because abnormality information sent from the controller 30 is written to the IC tags 10 and 20 by the controller 30, no processing and no sending to the controller 40 is performed.",
        "(D-3) At-the-time-of-abnormality record mode: A record is made only when conditions are met in the abnormality judgements of steps S48 to S56.",
        "The controller 40 of the carrying container 4 has the radio module 414 and communicates with the management server 5 at the control center. Then, the GPS module 416 obtains the present position of the carrying container 4.",
        "Using the interval timer, which is not shown in the sensor controller 410, an attempt to make a circuit connection for external communication is made periodically (e.g., once in every ten minutes). When an attempt for making a connection fails, another attempt is made after a certain time period (e.g., after one minute). When the attempt fails N times (e.g., three times), the present communication processing is ended and the operation waits until the next time.",
        "When a connection to the communication circuit has been successfully made, the abnormality information, sensor values, etc. recorded in the memory 412 and the present position of the carrying container 4 are transmitted to the management server 5.",
        "After the transmission of information, a response signal from the recipient (management server 5) is received. When no response signal is received or when the response signal indicates \u201cdata abnormality\u201d, then the information is transmitted again.",
        "After the transmission, the sensor values etc. recorded in the memory 412 are erased.",
        "Through the communication above, the management server 5 accumulates, periodically (e.g. with given cycles), the conditions and present position of the carrying container for transportation 1 to the carrying container 4 being transported, allowing the sender of the medical instruments 11 and the medical facility as the consignee of the medical instruments 11 to make inquiries to the management server 5 to know the conditions and present position of the medical instruments 11 being transported.",
        "As above, during transportation of the carrying container 4, the controller 40 performs the operations shown in FIG. 10 to monitor the conditions of the contents of the carrying container 4 (transportation containers for constant temperature 3, individual carrying containers 2, and carrying containers for transportation 1).",
        "The time and measured values of each measurement, the digital values of identifiers, and the abnormality judgement results (flag values) are outputted from the output terminal for external data 403 of the controller 40 of the carrying container 4. Accordingly, connecting the output terminal for external data 403 to a computer carried on a vehicle, for example, makes it possible to check, at any time, the conditions of the medical instruments 11 being transported.",
        "When the radio module 414 did not make external communication, or failed to make external communication, it may be recorded in the memory 412 as abnormality information.",
        "Also, the controller 30 of the transportation container for constant temperature 3 may obtain a temperature gradient (and/or temperature variation) from measured temperature values obtained from the IC tags 10 and 20 and judge whether it is possible to keep the predetermined temperature range till the due time of arrival (1-1-4) written in the IC tags 10. Then, if the judgement indicates that the temperature range cannot be maintained, the possibility that the temperature may be out of the predetermined range at the time of arrival at the destination may be recorded as an abnormality, even when the present temperatures of the carrying containers for transportation 1 and individual carrying containers 2 are normal.",
        "Particularly, the temperature retaining ability of the transportation container for constant temperature 3 depends on the amount of thermal storage of the thermal storage material 33, and the temperature retainable period varies with outside temperature. Accordingly, the temperature retainable period may be obtained on the basis of temperatures measured outside and inside the transportation container for constant temperature 3, and a warning may be displayed on the indicator 31 or 41 when the temperature retaining ability cannot be maintained until the time of arrival.",
        "Thus, when an abnormality about temperature or the like occurs in the carrying containers for transportation 1 or individual carrying containers 2 during transportation of the medical instruments 11 including living tissues, the controller 30 of the transportation container for constant temperature 3 and the controller 40 of the carrying container 4 operate as above to cause the indicators 31 and 41 to indicate the contents of the abnormality. This makes it possible to very quickly and easily know the presence/absence of abnormality by visually checking the indicators 31 and 41 of the carrying container 4 and transportation container for constant temperature 3 before the carrying containers for transportation 1 and individual carrying containers 2 are taken out of the transportation container for constant temperature 3.",
        "Next, a method of confirming the correctness of the carrying containers for transportation 1 will be described referring to the flowchart of FIG. 11. As shown in FIG. 7, this confirming process is conducted by using the reader/writer for IC tag 6 and the computer 60, where the computer 60 performs the operations shown in FIG. 11.",
        "When the indicators 31 and 41 indicate no information showing abnormalities, it is ensured that the temperature and acceleration were kept normal during the transportation. A transportation container for constant temperature 3 addressed to the consignee is taken out of the carrying container 4 and an individual carrying container 2 addressed to the consignee is offered from the transportation container for constant temperature 3.",
        "The delivered individual carrying container 2 is placed on the reader/writer for IC tag 6 and then the process of FIG. 11 starts. In step S60, the identifiers of the IC tags 10 (1-2-6) of the carrying containers for transportation 1 which have been copied in step S3 and step S4 are read from the IC tag 20 of the individual carrying container 2. The identifiers are read also from the IC tags 10 of the carrying containers for transportation 1 in the individual carrying container 2.",
        "Then, in step S61, the identifiers of the IC tags 10 of the carrying containers for transportation 1 read from the individual carrying container 2 are compared with the identifiers read from the IC tags 10 of the carrying containers for transportation 1 to judge whether they agree. When they do not agree, the processing goes to step S64 to make an indication of error showing that the identifiers of the IC tags 10 of the carrying containers for transportation 1 do not agree with the identifiers copied to the IC tag 20 of the individual carrying container 2.",
        "When two identifiers agree, the processing goes to step S62 to check whether the IC tags 10 and 20 contain any abnormality information. When abnormality information is absent, the processing indicates in step S63 that the check results show \u201cnormal\u201d. When abnormality information is present, the processing goes to step S65 to indicate the contents of the abnormality information.",
        "Thus, at the beginning of transportation, the identifiers of the IC tags 10 of the carrying containers for transportation 1 accommodated in the individual carrying container 2 are copied to the IC tag 20 of the individual carrying container 2, and a check is made at the destination of delivery to confirm that the identifiers copied to the IC tag 20 agree with the identifiers of the IC tags 10 of the carrying containers for transportation 1, whereby the correctness of the medical instruments 11 in the carrying containers for transportation 1 is ensured.",
        "In the first embodiment, the labels 111 of the IC tags 10 and 20 may be temperature labels that change color depending on temperature, in which case the color of the temperature labels changes when the temperature becomes out of a predetermined range, making it possible to easily show the occurrence of a temperature abnormality.",
        "Thus, the carrying containers for transportation 1 and individual carrying containers 2, and the passive IC tags with temperature sensors 10 and 20 attached thereto, are disposed of after use, and so the containers are kept sanitary and overwriting of identifiers is avoided, whereby reliability is ensured in sanitation aspect and correctness is ensured in information aspect. Also, because the carrying containers for transportation 1 and individual carrying containers 2, disposed of after use, are just provided with the IC tags 10 and 20, highly reliable services are offered at suppressed transportation costs.",
        "Also, by copying the identifiers of the IC tags 10 of carrying containers for transportation 1 to the IC tag 20 of the individual carrying container 2 accommodating the carrying containers for transportation 1, and by comparing the copied identifiers and the identifiers of the IC tags 10 of the carrying containers for transportation 1, the correctness of the delivered medical instruments 11 is ensured very easily and quickly.",
        "While the first embodiment uses a thermal storage material to maintain the temperature of the medical instruments 11, a warming device may be provided as described in the conventional example.",
        "Also, in the first embodiment, at the beginning of transportation, the external reader/writer for IC tag 6 is used to copy the identifiers of passive IC tags with temperature sensors 10 of carrying containers for transportation 1 to the passive IC tag with temperature sensor 20 attached to the individual carrying container 2. However, the controller 30 of the transportation container for constant temperature. 3 may copy the identifiers.",
        "Also, in the first embodiment, after transportation, the computer 60 connected to the reader/writer for IC tag 6 is used to check the identifiers of the passive IC tags with temperature sensors 10 attached to the carrying containers for transportation 1 with the identifiers of the carrying containers for transportation 1 that are stored in the passive IC tag with temperature sensor 20 attached to the individual carrying container 2. However, though not shown, a reader/writer having a checking and comparing function may be used instead.",
        "FIG. 12 shows a second embodiment, where the controller 30 of the transportation container for constant temperature 3 shown in FIG. 5 includes a radio module 314, a GPS module 316, a radio terminal antenna 315, and an antenna for GPS 317. In other respects, the configuration is the same as that of the first embodiment.",
        "In the second embodiment, the carrying containers for transportation 1 may be transported just by using the transportation container for constant temperature 3 without using the carrying container 4 of the first embodiment, and it is still possible to send the conditions of the carrying containers for transportation 1, including the present position, to the management server 5, just like the controller 40 of the carrying container 4 of the first embodiment does. In this case, in transportation of a small number of medical instruments 11 to a single destination, the removal of the need for the carrying container 4 reduces the cost.",
        "While the embodiments above have shown examples of transportation of medical instruments 11 including living tissues, this invention is applicable to transportation of any objects that require temperature control and identification of individual objects.",
        "FIG. 13 shows a third embodiment, where an external relay apparatus 9 for relaying radio communication is provided between the management server 5 shown in FIG. 2 and the carrying container 4, and the radio module 414 of the controller 40 of the carrying container 4 performs short-distance radio communication. In other respects, the configuration is the same as that of the first embodiment.",
        "In the third embodiment, the external relay apparatus 9 has a short-distance radio communication module 93 for making a connection to a short-distance radio communication network and a radio module 92 for making a connection to a cellular phone network, where the short-distance radio communication network and the cellular phone network are interswitchable.",
        "The controller 40 of the carrying container 4 can communicate with the management server 5 by using the short-distance radio communication network to reduce consumption of the battery 413.",
        "As has been described so far, this embodiments of this invention secures the environments of transportation and the identification of individual objects and is therefore applicable to transportation systems and transportation methods for transporting medical instruments including living tissues.",
        "While the present invention has been described in detail and pictorially in the accompanying drawings, the present invention is not limited to such detail but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the purview of the appended claims."
