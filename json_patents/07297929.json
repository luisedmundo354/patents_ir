        "Embodiments generally relate to methods and apparatus for detecting light.",
        "Typically, conventional ambient light sensors consist of a reversed biased photodiode, an amplifier, and an analog to digital converter (ADC). FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a conventional ambient light sensor 100. Ambient light sensor 100 includes a reversed biased photodiode 102 for detecting light 104 that strikes ambient light sensor 100. Photodiode 102 is coupled to a voltage source 106 and a resistor 108. Resistor 106 is coupled to ground.",
        "Ambient light sensor 100 also includes an amplifier 110 coupled to photodiode 102. Amplifier 110 amplifies the signal from photodiode 102. Ambient light sensor 100 also includes an analog to digital converter (ADC) 112 coupled to amplifier 108. ADC 112 converts the analog signal from amplifier into a digital signal for further processing. The spectral response of the photodiodes, such as photodiode 102, may be tuned, to the extent possible by the photodiode, to mimic the spectral response of the human eye.",
        "Ambient light sensors, such as sensor 100, may be incorporated into electronic devices such as televisions, computer monitors, and cell phones. In these devices, ambient light sensors provide environmental illumination information to backlight controllers or front light controllers of displays in the electronic devices. The information provided by the ambient light sensors assists in determining the brightness of the display in these devices. For example, if the ambient light sensor detects that the environmental illumination conditions are bright (e.g. a cell phone outside on a sunny day), the brightness of the display may be increased so that images on the displays may be viewable in the bright environmental conditions.",
        "These ambient light sensors, however, as designed to assume only homogeneous and static environmental illumination conditions. That is, these sensors assume that light from all angles is the same and the light does not change quickly over time. Because the ambient light sensors assume such illumination conditions, these sensors do not detect light well in settings where the intensity and direction of light may change rapidly, for example, within seconds or less. As such, these ambient light sensors are not suitable for devices such as avionics displays where lighting conditions may change rapidly. For example, fighter jets make rapid movements during flight, especially during combat. As such, the lighting conditions inside the cockpit of jet change rapidly as the jet maneuvers.",
        "Additionally, these ambient light sensors are not designed to account for certain conditions of the human eye, such as behavior of the eye when exposed to flashes of light, the dependence of eye sensitivity to illumination history, the response of the eye to extremely patterned light, and the adaptation of the eye to contrast. As such, these ambient light sensors are not suitable where these conditions may be a factor.",
        "An embodiment of the invention concerns a sensor. The sensor includes a light detector for dividing light in an environment into optical zones and detecting light from the optical zones. The sensor also includes a processor coupled to the light detector. The processor is configured to determine characteristics of the optical zones based on the detected light. The sensor also includes a memory coupled to the processor for storing the detected light as historic light readings.",
        "Another embodiment of the invention concerns a method for detecting light. The method includes detecting light from an environment by dividing the light into optical zone and storing the detected light as historic light readings for the optical zones. The method also includes determining a luminosity of a light source based on the historic light readings.",
        "Yet another embodiment of invention concerns a sensor. The sensor includes means for dividing an ambient environment into optical zones and means for detecting light from the optical zones positioned adjacent to the dividing means. The sensor also includes means for processing the detected light coupled to the detecting means and means for storing the detected light as historic light readings coupled to the processing means.",
        "Additional embodiments will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The embodiments will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.",
        "It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.",
        "The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate several embodiments and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.",

        "Embodiments of the invention are directed to a light sensor and a light sensing method. Accordingly to embodiments, the light sensor includes a multi-element light detector for detecting light in multiple optical zones in the environment. The multi-element light detector allows the light sensor to detect light in the optical zones and determine the characteristics of the environmental illumination conditions for each optical zone.",
        "Specifically, the multi-element light detector divides the environment into optical zones so that illumination conditions for each zone may be considered instead of considering the environment as a whole. By dividing the environment into optical zones, the light sensor may detect the environmental illumination conditions for the different optical zones. As such, the light sensor may determine the characteristics of the environmental illumination conditions for each optical zone.",
        "For example, the light sensor may determine the spatial characteristics of the environmental illumination conditions. The light sensor may determine the spatial distribution of light, spatial differentials of the environmental illumination conditions, and the spatial density of the environmental illumination conditions.",
        "Further, the light sensor stores the detected light in memory as historic data for the different optical zones. The light sensor may use the historic data to determine temporal characteristics of the environmental illumination conditions. For example, the light sensor may determine the rate of change in the illumination levels. Also, the historic data may be used to determine the spatial characteristics of the environmental illumination conditions over time.",
        "Further, the light sensor may use the detected environmental illumination conditions to determine the behavior of the human eye to these conditions. The light sensor may apply the environmental illumination conditions to models of human eye behavior. For example, the light sensor may use such models as Ricco's law, Bloch's law, Weber's law, Broca-Sulzer effect, Ferry-Porter Law, and Brucke-Bartley Effect. Also, the light sensor may use viewer specific metrics such as eye mobility, tolerances to visual excitations, and time constants.",

        "Further, light sensor 200 may use the environmental illumination conditions to determine the behavior of the human eye to these conditions. Light sensor 200 may apply the environmental illumination conditions, the temporal characteristics, and the spatial characteristics to a model of human eye behavior. Light sensor 200 may use such models as Ricco's law, Bloch's law, Weber's law, Broca-Sulzer effect, Ferry-Porter Law, and Brucke-Bartley Effect as described below. Each of these models may be used to determine the effect of a condition of the environment illumination effect on the human eye.",
        "To accommodate both sensitivity and resolution, the human eye developed two overlapping (duplex) sensory networks: one for high sensitivity and the other for increased resolution. The high sensitivity network consists of a mesh of rods (photoreceptor cells in the retina) and ganglion cells (neurons located in the retina of the eye attached to photoreceptor cells) with large receptive fields. The vision provided by this network is known as scotopic vision. Scotopic vision dominates the way we see at night.",
        "The second network has a much higher percentage of cones (cells in the eye retina of the eye which function in relative bright light and detect color) than rods. The cones are associated with ganglion cells with very small receptive fields. Vision using this network is called photopic vision. Photopic vision provides most of our visual input under bright light conditions.",
        "The human eye contains over 130 million photoreceptors. The photoreceptors are roughly divided between 3 million L (red) cones, 3 million M (green) cones, and only 1 million S (blue) cones, with the balance consisting of achromatic rods. At the center of the macula (center of the retina), we find mostly cones\u2014about 150,000 of them packed into an area of one square millimeter.",
        "Since cones occupy most of the macula, photopic visual acuity is associated mostly with the cones. The low density of S cones also indicates that our eyes have a much lower resolution for blue color detail. Still, the brain integrates the S cone signals into a continuous blue image which explains why gaps do not appear when observing a blue object.",
        "Ricco's law concerns the relationship between size of an object and the threshold illumination level needed to perceive the object. As it gets darker, humans have more and more difficulty reading small print and distinguishing small object. For a quantitative evaluation of Ricco's law, objects are standardized to a set of small white disks of different areas. For a fixed period of time, the threshold intensity, I, is inversely proportional to the area, A, of the disk. The relationship between the threshold intensity and area is known as Ricco's Law of Spatial Summations:\n\nI*A=constant",
        "The retinal response is an integral or summation of the photon flux over small retinal areas. In relative darkness, the threshold response disk area spans a 0.5 degree angle, while under good lighting condition the angle is found to be 0.06 degrees. Past a certain disk size (known as the area of complete summation), the threshold light intensity remains constant, which may indicate a dynamic pixilation of the retina. Once a certain object detail size is reached, that size becomes a pixel equivalent for the rest of the visual processing chain.",
        "There is considerable evidence that each area of complete summation is processed by single ganglion cell. The area of complete summation quantifies the two-dimensional resolution of the eye. In good lighting conditions, the eye's one-dimensional (line to line) threshold response may be up to three times better (approximately 0.02 degrees) than its two-dimensional performance. This may possibly be due to signal processing inference rather than eye optics.",
        "According to Ricco's law, high convergence areas of the retina (large receptive fields) correspond to high sensitivity. In other words, the larger the receptive filed, the lower the intensity threshold. In low convergence areas, the size of individual receptive fields is significantly smaller. Because these fields are closely packed, the resolution of the eye is much higher, but the intensity threshold increases accordingly.",
        "Bloch's law describes behavior when disk sizes and intensity level are kept constant, but the duration of each observation is varied. The time, T, it takes to perceive an object of a given (small) size is in inverse proportion to the luminosity, I, on that object. The relationship between I and T is given by Bloch's law:\n\nI*T=constant",
        "When the duration is increased past a critical value (called the duration of complete summation), the threshold intensity becomes constant. For rods, Bloch's law levels off at about 100 milliseconds. For cones, Bloch's law levels off after 50 milliseconds.",
        "The formal similarity between Ricco's law and Bloch's law suggests that threshold intensity level may be determined by the total energy of the photons contributed to a ganglion cell, regardless if it is obtained by summation over time or integration over local retinal area.",
        "The receptive fields associated with ganglion cells are not all the same, but the most common type is the center-surround receptive field. The center-surround receptive field's distinguishing feature is the presence of two distinct concentric subfields with opposite stimuli responses: a center circle and a doughnut. Subfields may be center-on/doughnut-off and center-off/doughnut-on fields. The center-on/doughnut-off field responds stronger when the center is illuminated more than the periphery. The center-off/doughnut-on responds stronger when the periphery is illuminated more.",
        "This arrangement makes the associated ganglion cell indifferent to uniform illumination but sensitive to high illumination gradients. High illumination gradient may be found in high-contrast images or around the edges of objects. Weber's law describes what happens when an illumination gradient \u0394I is superimposed on top of a uniform illumination Io. Weber's law states that a minimally noticeable change in light intensity is a constant proportion of the background intensity.\n\n\u0394I/Io=constant",
        "An object illuminated by a local source shows more detail when placed against a dark background than when placed against a well-lit background. This phenomenon is known as lightness constancy. However, when both the object and the background are illuminated by the same source the degree of detail evidenced by the object is the same regardless of scene illumination (for the same background). In this case, both \u0394I and Io are the result of surface reflectance. As such, the object's and background's ratio remains the same for all illumination levels. This effect is known as lightness contrast. A related parameter is maximum linear eye resolution which, under photopic conditions, is found to be about 0.02 degrees.",
        "An interesting side effect of Bloch's law is the Broca-Sulzer effect. The Broca-Sulzer occurs when the eye is exposed to bright flashes of light comparable in length to the Bloch critical duration (50 to 100 milliseconds). Under these conditions, a normalized decay follows a transient apparent amplification of the intensity of the light. A secondary gain mechanism appears during the temporal summation period that subsides when the summation is complete. This effect mimics a transient response of an under-damped feedback system.",
        "The critical flicker frequency (CFF) is a frequency value of an alternating illumination source above which the light appears to be continuous. Many factors influence our perception of flicker. One factor is the size of the light source. A large light source as a TV monitor may not exhibit flicker when viewed directly. The flicker may be quite pronounced if viewed at an angle. This occurrence suggests a higher CFF for the peripheral retina (rod-dominated) than for the macula (cone-dominated).",
        "CFF is also higher for larger objects than for smaller ones. Humans may also be trained to tolerate flicker. For example, Europe uses 50 Hz Pal monitors. Although most Europeans do not see the flicker, many visitors who grew up watching 60 Hz NTSC monitors are quite aware of flicker in the 50 Hz monitors.",
        "According to the Ferry-Porter law, the CFF is a linear function of the logarithm of the source luminance, I:\n\nCFF=A log(I)+B",
        "where A and B are constants.",
        "The Ferry-Porter law indicates that the higher the light intensity is, the higher the CFF. In other words, for a given stimulus frequency, the lower the intensity, the lower the CFF. The flickering of a Pal monitor, for example, becomes less evident if the luminosity is lowered or if the monitor is moved into a well-lit area (unless the area's lights are also powered by a 50 Hz frequency power source).",
        "Above CFF, there is not a distinction between the perceived luminosity of a continuous source and that of an intermittent source of equivalent emissive power. The Talbot Plateau law sets forth this effect.",
        "The perceived brightness of a source operating below CFF is significantly higher then the brightness of an equivalent continuous source (Brucke-Bartly effect). Peak perceived brightness is reached when the \u201con\u201d time of the flicker approaches the Bloch critical duration. This explains the high effectiveness of colored flashing warning signs operating in the 15 to 20 Hz range. The Brucke-Bartly effect is a steady state variation of the Broca-Sulzer effect discussed earlier.",
        "However, this maximum sensitivity peak holds only for photopic (cone-dominated) vision. Then, the CFF is close to a familiar 60 Hz and the flicker contrast threshold is around 1 percent. For scotopic vision, the CFF drops to 15 Hz and the contrast threshold increase to 20 percent.",
        "To account for all these effects a general function for the compensated output of a display can be written as:\n\nO(t)=f[[Ii(t),[Ii(t)\u2212Ij(t)],[Ii(t)\u2212Ii(tk)])]",
        "Where O(t) is the display output at time t, Ii(t) is the ambient light intensity seen by element i at time t, Ij(t) is the ambient light intensity seen by element j at time t, and Ii(tk) is the ambient light intensity seen by element i at a past lime tk. To a linear approximation this expression can be reduced to:\n\nO(t)=\u03a3i\u03b1iIi(t)+\u03a3i\u03a3j\u03b2i,j[Ii(t)\u2212Ij(t)]+\u03a3i\u03a3k\u03b3i,k[Ii(t)\u2212Ii(tk)])]",
        "Where the summations occur across elements (i,j) and across time (k), and the coefficients \u03b1i, j\u03b2i,j, and \u03b3i,k are empirical in nature and depend on the characteristics of the user. The above approximation concerns the environmental lighting condition of ambient light intensity. One skilled in the art will realize that the above approximation may be used with other environmental lighting conditions. Further, one skilled in the art will realize that the above linear approximation is exemplary and that higher order non-linear approximations or other approximations or other models may also be used.",
        "The execution of the above model may be performed by any hardware, software, or combination thereof, such as a microprocessor, a field programmable gate array (FPGA), or by other hardware, firmware, or software methods.",
        "For example, processor 208 in combination memory may determine the eye's responses to the environmental illumination conditions as a linear combination such as the above approximation. Processor 208 would apply the illumination information from multi-element sensor 202 to the models mentioned above to determine the eyes response to such conditions. The linear combination of this information would be used to determine the driving signal of a display device. Processor 208 may use various conditions such as contrast and intensity to determine the eyes response.",
        "Also, light sensor 200 may use viewer specific metrics such as eye mobility, tolerances to visual excitations, and time constants. These metrics may be standard for a typical user or these metrics may be programmed into light sensor for a particular user.",
        "Other embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims."
