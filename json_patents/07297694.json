        "Raf protein kinases are key components of signal transduction pathways by which specific extracellular stimuli elicit precise cellular responses in mammalian cells. Activated cell surface receptors activate ras/rap proteins at the inner aspect of the plasma-membrane which in turn recruit and activate Raf proteins. Activated Raf proteins phosphorylate and activate the intracellular protein kinases MEK1 and MEK2. In turn, activated MEKs catalyse phosphorylation and activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). A variety of cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates of activated MAPK are known which directly or indirectly contribute to the cellular response to environmental change. Three distinct genes have been identified in mammals that encode Raf proteins; A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf (also known as Raf-1) and isoformnic variants that result from differential splicing of mRNA are known.",
        "Inhibitors of Raf kinases have been suggested for use in disruption of tumor cell growth and hence in the treatment of cancers, e.g. histiocytic lymphoma, lung adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer and pancreatic and breast-carcinoma; also in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders associated with neuronal degeneration resulting from ischemic events, including cerebral ischemia after cardiac arrest, stroke and multi-infarct dementia and also after cerebral ischemic events such as those resulting from head injury, surgery and/or during childbirth; also in chronic neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease; also in the treatment of pain, migraine and cardiac hypertrophy.",

For instance see, W. Friedrichsen (p351, furans), R. J. Sundberg (p119, pyrroles) and J. Nakayama (p607, thiophenes) in Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry II, volume 2, series eds. A. R.

        "Typically, compounds of this invention may be prepared by a Paal-Knorr synthesis from a 1,4-dicarbonyl precursor, as outlined in Scheme 1 (where the groups \u2014XR1, R3, and R4 are hydrogen, and Y1 and Y2 are CH). For example, base (e.g. diethylamine) mediated condensation of an aryl-methyl ketone with pyridine4-carboxaldehyde results in the formation of a chalcone derivative (1, see S. E. deLaszlo et al Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1999, 9, 641). Subsequent reaction of the chalcone (1) with a suitably protected (e.g. a methoxyimine, PG=MeON) derivative of indan-1-one-5-carboxaldehyde and catalytic sodium cyanide under Stetter conditions (H. Stetter and K. Kuhlmann, Org. React., 1991, 40, 407) generates the aforementioned 1,4-dicarbonyl precursor (2). Cyclisation under the appropriate conditions then results in the formation of the desired furan (e.g. phosphorus pentoxide-methanesulphonic acid or concentrated sulphuric acid or HCl/acetone/dioxan), pyrrole (e.g. ammonium acetate, acetic acid) or thiophene (e.g. Lawessons reagent) ring systems (3). Thereafter, any substituents on the groups R2, X1/X2 may be modified using conventional functional group interconversion procedures and the group PG may be converted into an hydroxyimino group as in (4). It will also be appreciated to one skilled in the art, that the aldehyde components could be utilised in reverse order generating the chalcone derivative (5) and subsequently the regioisomeric heterocycles (6).",

        "wherein X1, X2 and R2 are as described for compounds of formula (I).",
        "Compounds of this invention may also be prepared by sequential transition metal catalysed cross-coupling reactions on a 2,3-dihalo heterocycle, as shown in Scheme 2; this is particularly applicable for furan or thiophene derivatives, i.e. when one of X1 or X2 are O or S. For example, Suzuki coupling of pyridine4-boronic acid with a 2,3-dibromofuran derivative (7) preferentially results in the formation of the 2-(4-pyridyl)-3-bromo-furan (8). Subsequent Suzuki reaction with an indanone boronic acid derivative (9, wherein PG is O, N\u2014OMe or another ketone protecting group) generates the derivative (10). Subsequently the group PG can also be converted into an hydroxyimino group as in (11). It will also be appreciated, to one skilled in the art, that the above cross-coupling reactions may be carried out in reverse order giving access to the regioisomeric heterocycles (12).",

        "Organotypic cultures provide an intermediate between dissociated neuronal cell cultures and in-vivo models of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). The majority of glial-neuronal interactions and neuronal circuitry are maintained in cultured hippocampal slices, so facilitating investigation of the patterns of death among differing cell types in a model that resembles the in vivo situation. These cultures allow the study of delayed cellular damage and death 24 hours, or more, post-insult and permit assessment of the consequences of long-term alterations in culture conditions. A number of laboratories have reported delayed neuronal damage in response to OGD in organotypic cultures of the hippocampus (Vornov et al., Stroke, 1994, 25, 57-465; Newell et al., Brain Res., 1995, 676, 3844). Several classes of compounds have been shown to protect in this model, including EAA antagonists (Strasser et al., Brain Res., 1995, 687, 167-174), Na channel blockers (Tasker et al., J. Neurosci., 1992, 12, 984308) and Ca channel blockers (Pringle et al., Stroke, 1996, 7, 2124-2130). To date, relatively little is known of the roles of intracellular kinase mediated signalling pathways in neuronal cell death in this model.",
        "Method: Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared using the method of Stoppini et al., J. Neurosci. Methods, 1995, 37, 173-182. Briefly, 400 micron sections prepared from hippocampi of 7-8 day postnatal Sprague Dawley rats are cultured on semiporous membranes for 9-12 days. OGD is then induced by incubation in serum and glucose-free medium in an anaerobic chamber for 45 minutes. Cultures are then returned to the air/CO2 incubator for 23 hours before analysis. Propidium iodide (PI) is used as an indicator of cell death. PI is non toxic to neurones and has been used in many studies to ascertain cell viability. In damaged neurons PI enters and binds to nucleic acids. Bound PI shows increased emission at 635 nm when excited at 540 nm. One PI fluorescence image and one white light image are taken and the proportion of cell death analysed. The area of region CA1 is defined from the white light image and superimposed over the PI image. The PI signal is thresholded and area of PI damage expressed as a percentage of the CA1 area. Correlation between PI fluorescence and histologically confirmed cell death has been validated previously by Niss1-staining using cresyl fast violet (Newell et al., J. Neurosci., 1995, 15, 7702-7711).\n\nMethylene Blue Growth Inhibition Assay (Assay 2)",

To release stain from the cells 100 \u03bcl of solubilization solution was added (1% N-lauroyl sarcosine, sodium salt, Sigma L5125, in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS)), and plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Optical density at 620 nM was measured on a microplate reader. Percent inhibition of cell growth was calculated relative to vehicle treated control wells. Concentration of compound that inhibits 50% of cell growth (IC50) was interpolated using nonlinear regression (Levenberg-Marquardt) and the equation, y=Vmax*(1\u2212(x/(K+x)))+Y2, where \u201cK\u201d was equal to the IC50.",

        "Human diploid foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) or human colon carcinoma (Colo 201) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen/Life Technologies) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and the antibiotics penicillin (100 Units/ml) and streotomycin (100 micrograms/ml) (Invitrogen/Life Technologies). Growth was at 37\u00b0 C. in humidified 5% CO2 incubators in 75 cm2 plastic flasks. Cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin/1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), resuspended in growth medium, and counted using a hemocytometer. Flat-bottomed 96-well plates were seeded with 2\u00d7103 cells/well in a volume of 200 ul from trypsinized exponentially growing cultures. To \u201cblank\u201d wells, growth medium was added with no additions. Cells were incubated overnight to permit attachment.",
        "Next day, medium from wells that contained cells was replaced with 180 microliters of fresh medium. Appropriate dilutions of test compounds were added to the wells from stock soloutions of compound dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); final DMSO concentration in all wells was 0.2%. Cells plus compound were incubated for an additional 72 hr at 37\u00b0 C. under normal growth conditions. Cells were then assayed for viability using standard XTT/PMS*. Fifty microliters of XTT/PMS solution was added to each well and plates were incubated for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Absorbance at 450 nM was then determined using a 96-well UV plate reader (Molecular Devices). Under these conditions, absorbance of untreated control cells at 450 nm was at least 1.0 optical density unit/ml. Percent viability of cells in each well was calculated from these data (having been corrected for background absorbance). It was equal to\n\n100\u00d7(A450 test well/A450 untreated control well),\n\nthe A450s being averages of triplicate determinations. IC50 was that concentration of compound that reduced cell viability to 50% of control (untreated) viability, as determined from plots of concentration vs percent viability.\n\nPreparation of XTT/PMS Solution (immediately before assay).\n\n    \n    \n        For each 96-well plate, 8 mg XTT (2,3-bis[2-Methoxy4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) (Sigma Chemical Co.) per plate was dissolved in 100 ul DMSO. 3.9 ml H2O was added to dissolve XTT and 20 ul of PMS (phenazine methosulfate, Sigma Chemical Co.) stock solution (30 mg/ml) was added from frozen aliquoted stock solution (10 mg of PMS in 3.3 ml phosphate buffered saline (Invitrogen/Life Technologies). (These stocks are routinely frozen at \u221220\u00b0 C. until use).",
