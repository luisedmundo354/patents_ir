The reception system also includes a modified legacy VSB receiver for processing the data received from the VSB transmission system in a reverse order of the VSB transmission system by using the sequence, and a demultiplexer for demultiplexing the data from the modified legacy VSB receiver into the MPEG data and the supplemental data. The VSB reception system also includes a supplemental data processor for processing the supplemental data segment from the demultiplexer in a reverse order of the transmission system, to obtain the supplemental data, thereby carrying out the slicer prediction, decoding, and symbol decision more accurately by using the predefined sequence, to improve a performance.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present intention relates to a digital television reception system, and more particularly, to a 8T-VSB (Vestigial Sideband) reception system resistant to ghost and noise and receiving and decoding supplemental data in addition to MPEG data.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "The United States of America has employed ATSC 8T-VSB (8 Trellis-Vestigial Sideband) as a standard since 1995, and has been broadcasting in the ATSC 8T-VSB since the later half of 1998. South Korea also has employed the ATSC 8T-VSD as a standard. South Korea started test broadcasting in May 1995, and has since August 2000 put in place a regular test broadcasting system. The advancement of technology allows the transmission of digital television(DTV) in the same 6 MHz bandwidth currently used by NTSC.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of a conventional ATSC 8T-VSB transmission system 25 (\u201cVSB transmission system\u201d). The VSB transmission system 25 generally comprises a data randomizer 1, Reed-Solomon coder 2, data interleaver 3, Trellis coder 4, multiplexer 5, pilot inserter 6, VSB modulator 7 and RF converter 8.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1, there is a data randomizer 1 for receiving and making random MPEG data (video, audio and ancillary data). The data randomizer 1 receives the MPEG-II data output from an MPEG-II encoder. Although not shown in FIG. 1, the MPEG-II encoder takes baseband digital video and performs bit rate compression using the techniques of discrete cosine transform, run length coding, and bi-directional motion prediction. The MPEG-II encoder then multiplexes this compressed data together with pre-coded audio and any ancillary data that will be transmitted. The result is a stream of compressed MPEG-II data packets with a data frequency of only 19.39 Mbit/Sec. The MPEG-II encoder outputs such data to the data randomizer in serial form. MPEG-II packets are 188 bytes in length with the first byte in each packet always being the sync or header byte. The MPEG-II sync byte is then discarded. The sync byte will ultimately be replaced by the ATSC segment sync in a later stage of processing.",
        "In the VSB transmission system 25, the 8-VSB bit stream should have a random, noise-like signal. The reason being that the transmitted signal frequency response must have a flat noise-like spectrum in order to use the allotted 6 MHz channel space with maximum efficiency. Random data minimizes interference into analog NTSC. In the data randomizer 1, each byte value is changed according to known pattern of pseudo-random number generation. This process is reversed in the VSB receiver in order to recover the proper data values.",
        "The Reed-Solomon coder 2 of the VSB transmission system 25 is used for subjecting the output data of the data randomizer 1 to Reed-Solomon coding and adding a 20 byte parity code to the output data. Reed Solomon encoding is a type of forward error correction scheme applied to the incoming data stream. Forward error correction is used to correct bit errors that occur during transmission due to signal fades, noise, etc. Various types of techniques may be used as the forward error correction process.",
        "The Reed-Solomon coder 2 takes all 187 bytes of an incoming MPEG-II data packet (the sync or header byte has been removed from 188 bytes) and mathematically manipulates them as a block to create a digital sketch of the block contents. This \u201csketch\u201d occupies 20 additional bytes which are added at the tail end of the original 187 byte packet. These 20 bytes are known as Reed-Solomon parity bytes. The 20 Reed-Solomon parity bytes for every data packet add redundancy for forward error correction of up to 10 byte errors/packet. Since Reed-Solomon decoders correct byte errors, and bytes can have anywhere from 1 to 8 bit errors within them, a significant amount of error correction can be accomplished in the VSB reception system. The output of the Reed-Solomon coder 2 is 207 bytes (187 plus 20 parity bytes).",
        "The VSB reception system will compare the received 187 byte block to the 20 parity bytes in order to determine the validity of the recovered data. If errors are detected, the receiver can use the parity bytes to locate the exact location of the errors, modify the corrupted bytes, and reconstruct the original information.",
        "The data interleaver 3 interleaves the output data of the Reed-Solomon coder 2. In particular, the data interleaver 3 mixes the sequential order of the data packet and disperses or delays the MPEG-II packet throughout time. The data interleaver 3 then reassembles new data packets incorporating small sections from many different MPEG-II (pre-interleaved) packets. The reassembled packets are 207 bytes each.",
        "The purpose of the data interleaver 3 is to prevent losing of one or more packets due to noise or other harmful transmission environment. By interleaving data into many different packets, even if one packet is completely lost, the original packet may be substantially recovered from information contained in other packets.",
        "The VSB transmission system 25 also has a trellis coder 4 for converting the output data of the data interleaver 3 from byte form into symbol form and for subjecting it to trellis coding. In the trellis coder 4, bytes from the data interleaver 3 are converted into symbols and provided one by one to a plurality of Trellis coders and precoders 32-1 to 32-12, shown in FIG. 7.",
        "Trellis coding is another form of forward error correction. Unlike Reed-Solomon coding, which treated the entire MPEG-II packet simultaneously as a block, trellis coding is an evolving code that tracks the progressing stream of bits as it develops through time.",
        "The trellis coder 4 adds additional redundancy to the signal in the form of more (than four data levels, creating the multilevel (8) data symbols for transmission. For trellis coding, each 8-bit byte is split up into a stream of four, 2-bit words. In the trellis coder 4, each 2-bit input word is compared to the past history of previous 2-bit words. A 3-bit binary code is mathematically generated to describe the transition from the previous 2-bit word to the current one. These 3-bit codes are substituted for the original 2-bit words and transmitted as the eight level symbols of 8-VSD. For every two bits that enter the trellis coder 4, three bits come out.",
        "The trellis decoder in the VSB receiver uses the received 2-bit transition codes to reconstruct the evolution of the data stream from one 2-bit word to the next. In this way, the trellis coder follows a \u201ctrail\u201d as the signal moves from one word to the next through time. The power of trellis coding lies in its ability to track a signal's history through time and discard potentially faulty information (errors) based on a signal's past and future behavior.",
        "A multiplexer 5 is used for multiplexing a symbol stream from the trellis coder 4 and synchronizing signals. The segment and the field synchronizing signals provide information to the VSB receiver to accurately locate and demodulate the transmitted RF signal. The segment and the field synchronizing signals are inserted after the randomization and error coding stages so as not to destroy the fixed time and amplitude relationships that these signals must possess to be effective. The multiplexer 5 provides the output from the trellis coder 4 and the segment and the field synchronizing signals in a time division manner.",
        "An output packet of the data interleaver 3 comprises the 207 bytes of an interleaved data packet. After trellis coding, the 207 byte segment is stretched out into a baseband stream of 828 eight level symbols. The segment synchronizing signal is a four symbol pulse that is added to the front of each data segment and replaces the missing first byte (packet sync byte) of the original MPEG-II data packet. The segment synchronizing signal appears once every 832 symbols and always takes the form of a positive-negative-positive pulse swinging between the +5 and \u22125 signal levels",
        "The field synchronizing signal is an entire data segment that is repeated once per field. The field synchronizing signal has a known data symbol pattern of positive-negative pulses and is used by the receiver to eliminate signal ghosts caused by poor reception.",
        "The VSB transmission system 25 also has the pilot inserter 6 for inserting pilot signals into the symbol stream from the multiplexer 5. Similar to the synchronizing signals described above, the pilot signal is inserted after the randomization and error coding stages so as not to destroy the fixed time and amplitude relationships that these signals must possess to be effective.",
        "Before the data is modulated, a small DC shift is applied to the 8T-VSB baseband signal. This causes a small residual carrier to appear at the zero frequency point of the resulting modulated spectrum. This is the pilot signal provided by the pilot inserter 6. This gives the RF PLL circuits in the VSB receiver something to lock onto that is independent of the data being transmitted.",
        "After the pilot signal has been inserted by the pilot inserter 6, the output is subjected to a VSB modulator 7. The VSB modulator 7 modulates the symbol stream from the pilot inserter 6 into an 8 VSB signal of an intermediate frequency band. The VSB modulator 7 provides a filtered (root-raised cosine) IF signal at a standard frequency (44 Mhz in the U.S.), with most of one sideband removed.",
        "In particular, the eight level baseband signal is amplitude modulated onto an intermediate frequency (IF) carrier. The modulation produces a double sideband IF spectrum about the carrier frequency. The total spectrum is too wide to be transmitted in the assigned 6 MHz channel.",
        "The sidelobes produced by the modulation are simply scaled copies of the center spectrum, and the entire lower sideband is a mirror image of the upper sideband. Therefore using a filter, the VSB modulator discards the entire lower sideband and all of the sidelobes in the upper sideband. The remaining signal (upper half of the center spectrum) is firmer eliminated in one-half by using the Nyquist filter. The Nyquist filter is based on the Nyquist Theory, which summarizes that only a \u00bd frequency bandwidth is required to transmit a digital signal at a given sampling rate.",
        "Finally, there is a RF (Radio Frequency) converter 8 for converting the signal of an intermediate frequency band from the VSB modulator 7 into a signal of a RF band signal, and for transmitting the signal to a reception system through an antenna 9.",
        "The foregoing VSB communication system is at least partially described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,636,251, 5,629,958 and 5,600,677 by Zenith Co. which are incorporated herein by reference. The 8T-VSB transmission system, which is employed as the standard digital TV broadcasting in North America and South Korea, was developed for the transmission of MPEG video and audio data. As technologies for processing digital signals develop and the use of the Internet increases, the trend currently is to integrate digitized home appliances, the personal computer, and the Internet into one comprehensive system.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates a related art ATSC 8T-VSB reception system 150 (\u201cVSB reception system\u201d). In FIG. 2, there is a demodulator 11 for receiving a RF band signal through an antenna 10 and converting the RE band signal into a base band signal, a synchronizing and timing recovery (not shown) for recovering a segment synchronizing signal, a field synchronizing signal and symbol timing.",
        "There is a comb filter 12 for removing an NTSC interference signal, and a channel equalizer 13 for correction of a distorted channel by using a slicer predictor 14. A phase tracker 15 is provided for correcting a phase of a received signal, and a Trellis decoder 16 for subjecting the phase corrected signal to Viterbi decoding. There is a data deinterleaver 17 for carrying out a reverse action of the data interleaver 3 in the transmission system, and a Reed-Solomon decoder 18 for decoding the Reed-Solomon coded signal.",
        "The VSB reception system 150 further includes a a data derandomizer 19 for making a reverse action of the data randomizer 1 in the transmission system. Thus, the VSB reception system 150 can receive only the MPEG data, and no supplemental data. Accordingly, the development of a reception system that can receive the supplemental data as well as the MPEG video and audio data is needed. Moreover, the prediction reliability of the slicer predictor 14 in the VSB reception system 150, which predicts a signal level group, degrades in the presence of excessive channel noise or an excessive ghost.",
        "Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a VSB reception system that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.",
        "An object of the present invention is to provide a digital VSB reception system which can receive both MPEG data and supplemental data.",
        "Another object of the present invention is to provide a digital VSB reception system which has significantly improved performance over channel noise and ghost than the related art ATSC 8T-VSB reception system.",
        "Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.",
        "To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described, a VSB reception system for receiving and decoding an input signal (comprising an MPEG data segment and a supplemental data segment) transmitted from a VSB transmission system comprises a sequence generator for indicating a symbol corresponding to the supplemental data and generating a predefined sequence encoded with the supplemental data; a modified legacy VSB receiver for processing the input signal received from the VSB transmission system in a reverse order of the VSB transmission system and outputting a derandomized data signal; a demultiplexer for demultiplexing the derandomized data signal from the modified legacy VSB receiver into the MPEG data segment and an encoded supplemental data segment; and a supplemental data processor for decoding the encoded supplemental data segment from the demultiplexer to obtain the supplemental data segment.",
        "According to one aspect of the present invention, the sequence generator includes a multiplexer for receiving and multiplexing a supplemental data dummy packet and an MPEG data dummy packet; a randomizer for randomizing an output signal of the multiplexer; a parity inserter for inserting dummy bytes to randomized data; a data interleaver for interleaving an output of the parity inserter; and a trellis coder for converting interleaved data to symbols and outputting the converted symbols without subjecting to trellis coding. Preferably, the trellis coder includes a plurality of coders and precoders for receiving the symbols and forwarding the symbols without subjecting to precoding and coding.

        "According to another aspect of the present invention, the modified legacy VSB receiver includes a demodulator for receiving the input signal through and converting the input signal into a base band signal, and recovering a segment synchronizing signal, a field synchronizing signal, and a symbol timing from the base band signal; a comb filter for removing an NTSC interference signal from an output signal of the demodulator, if the NTSC interference signal is detected; a slicer predictor for providing a slicer prediction signal and a prediction reliability signal by using a predefined sequence from the sequence generator; a channel equalizer for correcting a distorted channel in an output signal of the comb filter by using the slicer prediction signal, the prediction reliability signal and the predefined sequence and outputting a channel equalizer output signal; a phase tracker for correcting a phase of an output signal of the channel equalizer by using the predetermined sequence and the slicer prediction signal from a trellis decoder; a trellis decoder for decoding an output of the phase tracketer using Viterbi algorithm and the predefined sequence received from the sequence generator; a data deinterleaver for deinterleaving a trellis decoder output signal; a Reed-Solomon decoder for decoding a Reed-Solomon coded signal outputted from the data deinterleaver; and a data derandomizer for derandomizing a Reed-Solomon decoder output signal.",

However, because there is a data interleaver in the ATSC 8T-VSB transmission system, the data interleaver for the supplemental data can be omitted if it is not required to enhance the burst noise performance of the supplemental data. For this reason, the data interleaver 21 may not be necessary for the VSB supplemental data processor 90.",
        "The VSB supplemental data processor 90 also includes the null sequence inserter 22 for inserting a null sequence to an allocated region of the interleaved (if the data interleaver 21 was present) or Reed-Solomon coded supplemental data for generating the predefined sequence for the supplemental data at an input terminal of a Trellis coder (shown in FIG. 1). The null sequence is inserted so that the VSB reception system receives the supplemental data reliably, even in a noisy channel or multipath fading channel. An example structure of the transmission data formed by the insertion of the null sequence will be explained below in detail with reference to FIG. 4.",
        "Further referring to FIG. 3, the VSB supplemental data processor 90 includes the MPEG header inserter 23 for adding an MPEG header to the supplemental data having the null sequence inserted thereto, for backward-compatibility with the legacy VSB reception system. Because the MPEG-II data supplied to the VSB transmission system 25 is 187 bytes long, the MPEG header inserter 23 places, preferably, three headers in front of each packet (which was 184 bytes) to form a 187 byte long packet identical to the MPEG-II data packet.",
        "The supplemental data having the MPEG header added thereto is provided to a multiplexer 24. The multiplexer 24 receives as inputs the processed supplemental data from the MPEG header inserter 23 and MPEG data packets. MPEG data packet, such as a broadcasting program (movie, sports, entertainment, or drama), coded through a different signal path (output from MPEG encoder), is received together with the supplemental data at the multiplexer 24. Upon reception of the MPEG data and the supplemental data, the multiplexer 24 multiplexes the supplemental data and the MPEG data at a fixed ratio under the control of a controller defining a multiplexing ratio and unit and forwards the multiplexed data to the 8T-VSB transmission system 25.",
        "The VSB transmission system 25, which is described in detail in reference to FIG. 1, processes the multiplexed data and transmits the processed data to the VSB reception system through the antenna 26.",

On the other hand, as a generator polynomial of the Galois Field and the Reed-Solomon coder 20, the same code as the Reed-Solomon coder 2 described with respect to FIG. 1 may be used. According to the preferred embodiment, other values of the block size N, the payload K, and the error correction capability T may be used in the Reed-Solomon coder 20 in FIG. 3. For an example, a code having N=184, K=154, and T=15 may be used, or a code having N=92, K=82, and T=5 may be used. Although the Reed-Solomon code is used in the present invention other code suitable for error correction known to one of ordinary skill in the art may be used therein.",
        "In the VSB transmission system 25, one data field has 313 segments: 312 data segments 124 and one field synchronizing segment 122. The 312 data segments have data segments of the supplemental data and the MPEG data segments. Each data segment has 184 byte data, a 3 byte MPEG header, and the 20 byte Reed-Solomon parity. The 3 byte MPEG header will be used by the MPEG decoder in the VSB reception system.",
        "The use of the MPEG header is explained in more detail. ISO/IEC 13818-1 has a definition on an MPEG transport packet header. If a 0\u00d747 synchronization byte is removed from the MPEG transport packet header, a 3 byte header is left. A PID (program identification) is defined by this 3 bytes. A transport part of the MPEG decoder discards a packet if the PID of the received packet received is not valid. For example, a null packet PID or other reserved PID can be used. Therefore, the MPEG header inserter 14 in FIG. 2 inserts the 3 byte header containing such a PID into the supplemental data packet. Therefore, the supplemental data can be discarded at the MPEG decoder of the legacy VSB receiver.",
        "The VSB reception system determines the multiplexing locations of the MPEG data and the supplemental data in the field data received synchronous to the field synchronizing signal. The VSB reception system demultiplexes the MPEG data and the supplemental data based on the multiplexing locations. A multiplexing ratio and method for multiplexing the MPEG data and the supplemental data may vary with amounts of data thereof.",
        "Information on the variable multiplexing method and ratio may be loaded, for example, on a reserved area of the 92 bits not used in the field synchronizing signal. By retrieving and decoding such information, the VSB reception system identifies the correct multiplexing ratio and method from the multiplexing information contained in the field synchronizing signal.",
        "Alternatively, the multiplexing information may be inserted, not only in the reserved area of the field synchronizing signal, but also in the data segment of the supplemental data. One of the supplement data segment may be used to transmit the multiplexing information for use by the VSB reception system.",

For example, the predefined sequence may be an output of a pseudo random sequence generator whose initial value is fixed in advance. As shown in FIG. 4, upon reception of one bit of supplemental data, the null sequence inserter 22 inserts one null bit therein, to provide 2 bits. The null bit is randomized in the 8T-VSB transmission system in FIG. 3, and then subjected to Reed-Solomon coding. The coded supplemental data is interleaved, and applied to a Trellis coder (not shown) as an input d0. The input signal d0 is a low order bit of the two bits applied to the Trellis coder.",

The null sequence is randomized by the data randomizer 1 of the VSB transmission system 25, and coded by the Reed-Solomon coder 2. Then, the null sequence is interleaved by the data interleaver 3, and provided to the Trellis coder 4 as an input signal D0. This converted sequence is the predefined sequence. The input signal D0 is a lower bit of the two input bits to the Trellis coder 4. The Trellis coder is basically operative such that three bits are provided with two received bits.",
        "The VSB reception system generates the sequence received as the input signal D0 from the Trellis coder in the 8T-VSB transmission system 25, i.e., the predefined sequence, and uses the generated sequence for improving the performance of the VSB reception system.

An 8T-VSB modulator 29 provides modulated values \u2018z\u2019 of the three output bits C0, C1, and C2. In FIG. 5, reference numerals 27a and 28b denote adders, and 27b, 28a, and 28c denote registers.",
        "As shown in FIG. 5, the input bit D1 is precoded into the output bit C2 by the precoder 27. The input bit D0 is the same as the output bit C1. The output bit C0 is a value stored in the register 28c of the Trellis coder 28. Signal levels are determined by an output bitstream C0, C1, and C2 of the Trellis coder 28 and the precoder 77, wherein there are 8 whole signal levels (\u22127, \u22125, \u22123, \u22121, +1, +3, +5, +7). The whole signal levels are divided into two groups of signal levels (\u22127, \u22123, +1, +5) (\u22125, \u22121, +3, +7) each with 4 levels according to the output bit C0. In other words, one out of the two groups of signal levels (\u22127, \u22123, +1, +5) (\u22125, \u22121, +3, +7) each with 4 levels are selected according to the value stored in the register 28c.",
        "Therefore, if the estimation of the present value stored in the register 28c in the coder 28 is possible, prediction of an output signal level of the coder 28 falling on one of the two signal level groups is possible. In other words, to estimate the present value of the register 28c in coder 28 means to predict one of the two signal level group in which the next output signal of the coder 28 will fall on. As a result, a four level slicer having two times the distance between each signal level can be used instead of a conventional 8 level slicer with reduced signal level separations.",
        "In order to estimate the value stored in the register 28c of the coder 28, the Viterbi algorithm is preferably used for the Trellis decoder 52 of the VSB reception system 100 (shown in FIG. 8). If a wrong prediction is made on the signal level groups, the prediction error can be higher. Therefore, for minimizing the prediction error, the conventional 8T-VSB reception system 150 (shown in FIG. 2) uses the four level slicer if the prediction reliability is high, and/or uses an original 8 slicer if the prediction reliability is low.",

A part that carries out such a process is called an ACS (Accumulate/Compare/Select) module.

The output signal of the channel equalizer 68 is provided to the nine slicers 69-1 to 69-9 in common, for the slicers 69-1 to 69-9 to decide the signal level.",
        "The controller 71 controls the multiplexer 70 such that the multiplexer 70 selects one of the outputs of the slicers 69-1 to 69-9 and provides to the feedback filter 67, and the controller 71. The controller 71 updates filter coefficients of the feed-forward filter 66 and the feedback filter 67 by using the selected slicer output and file output of the channel equalizer 49. As shown in FIG. 8, the slicer predictor 50 receives the output signal of the channel equalizer 49 and the output signal of the sequence generator 46, and predicts a value stored in the register 28c of the Trellis coder 28 in the VSB transmission system by using the received signals. The slicer predictor 50 then calculates the reliability of the predicted value, and forwards the values to the controller 71 of the channel equalizer 49.",
        "The controller 71 of the channel equalizer 49 receives information on the symbol received as being the supplemental data or the MPEG data, and the predefined sequence D0 inserted in the supplemental data symbol from the sequence generator 46. The controller 71 receives the estimated value of the register 28c of the Trellis coder 28 in the transmission system together with the prediction reliability from the slicer predictor 50, and, selects one of the outputs of the nine slicers 69-1 to 69-9.",
        "As described above, the VSB reception system 300 according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention has the following advantages. First, the VSB reception system has components for processing both the MPEG data and the supplemental data.",
        "Second, the sequence generator 46 provided in the VSB reception system 300 (for generating a predefined sequence as an input signal to a Trellis coder of a transmission system) can improve reception performance of the reception system with respect to a channel ghost signal and a noise signal over the related art ATSC 8T-VSB reception system. Particularly, performances of the slicer predictor and the Trellis coder in the reception system are significantly improved.",
        "Third, by using the predefined sequence, the VSB reception system 300 can use slicers each having a greater signal distance than the conventional slicers at the channel equalizer and the phase tracker therein, which minimizes decision error. This enhances the tracker deghosting performance of the equalizer and the phase tracking performance of the phase tracker.",
        "It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the VSB communication system, and the signal format for the VSB communication system of the present invention without depositing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents."
