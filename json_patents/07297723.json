        "Here and below, a combination effect coat is a coat which in a color and/or effect coating system fulfills at least two functions. Functions of this kind are, in particular, protection against corrosion, promotion of adhesion, absorption of mechanical energy, and imparting of color and/or effect. In particular, the combination effect coat serves to absorb mechanical energy and to impart color and/or effect at the same time it therefore fulfills the functions of a primer-surfacer coat or antistonechip primer coat and of a basecoat. Preferably, furthermore, the combination effect coat has a corrosion protection effect and/or adhesion promotion effect (cf.

The dual-cure mixtures necessarily include constituents, such as (meth)acrylate copolymers, which besides isocyanate-reactive functional groups mandatorily contain (meth)acryloyl groups, and constituents, such as (meth)acrylate copolymers, for example, which besides complementary free isocyanate groups likewise mandatorily contain (meth)acryloyl groups. Furthermore, they may comprise (meth)acrylate copolymers which are free from (meth)acryloyl groups but contain isocyanate-reactive groups. Over and above this, the German patent application describes a host of alternatives to these components, which are all said to be of equal effect. For example, instead of the (meth)acrylate copolymers which besides isocyanate-reactive functional groups mandatorily contain (meth)acryloyl groups it is possible to use the analogous urethane (meth)acrylates. Moreover, the glass transition temperatures, Tg, which the (meth)acryloyl-free (meth)acrylate copolymers are to have are not stated.",

In the case of aqueous dual-cure coating materials, measures must be taken to ensure the dilutability of the binders in water. To achieve sufficient water dilutability it is preferred to use emulsifiers, with particular preference nonionic emulsifiers. Dual-cure powder slurries, however, are not described.",
        "It is indeed stated that the known dual-cure coating materials give coatings having very good chemical, gasoline and solvent resistance, high scratch resistance, and good and rapid sandability, and are said in this respect to satisfy the requirements imposed on a multicoat system in the field of automotive finishing, especially automotive refinish. Furthermore, the coatings are said to be free from cracks and to exhibit good adhesion to the substrate. Overall, they are said to show a flawless visual appearance. But as to how this profile of properties can be optimized and adjusted in detail, and as to which of the virtually innumerable alternatives, which may be inferred from a plurality of lists, are the ones which function best, neither the description nor any example gives specifics.",

The clearcoat material contains, based on its solids content, from 50 to 98% by weight of a system A) which is curable thermally by addition and/or condensation reactions, and is substantially free from free-radically polymerizable double bonds and substantially free from groups reactive in other ways with free-radically polymerizable double bonds of the system B), and from 2 to 50% by weight of a system B) which can be cured by free-radical polymerization of olefinic double bonds on exposure to actinic radiation.",

        "The German patent application DE 199 20 799 A1 discloses a dual-cure coating material mandatorily containing\n\n    (a1) at least one constituent containing\n    \n        (a11) at least two functional groups which serve for crosslinking with actinic radiation, and if desired\n        (a12) at least one functional group which is able to undergo thermal crosslinking reactions with a complementary functional group (a22) in the constituent (a2),\n\nand\n\n    \n    \n    (a2) at least one constituent containing\n    \n        (a21) at least two functional groups which serve for crosslinking with actinic radiation, and\n        (a22) at least one functional group which is able to undergo thermal crosslinking reactions with a complementary functional group (a12) in the constituent (a1),\n\nand if desired\n\n    \n    \n    (a3) at least one photoinitiator,\n    (a4) at least one thermal crosslinking initiator,\n    (a5) at least one reactive diluent curable thermally and/or with actinic radiation,\n    (a6) at least one coatings additive and/or\n    (a7) at least one thermally curable constituent;\n\nwith the proviso that the coating material comprises at least one thermally curable constituent (a7) if the constituent (a1) contains no functional group (a12).",
        "The dual-cure coating material may be used as a clearcoat material and, given an appropriate choice of its constituents, may also be a dual-cure powder slurry.",
        "As constituent (a1) it is possible, inter alia, to use a urethane (meth)acrylate. It is also possible, however, to use hydroxyl-containing urethane (meth) acrylates (a1). The (meth) acrylate functionality of constituent (a1) is at least 2. No further details are given.",
        "The mandatory constituent (a2) comprises in particular an isocyanato acrylate having free isocyanate groups, as is described, for example, in the European patent application EP 0 928 800 A1.",
        "Furthermore, the dual-cure mixture may also comprise thermally curable (meth)acrylate copolymers (a7), for which, however, numerous alternatives are stated. Moreover, the thermally curable (meth)acrylate copolymers (a7) are not characterized in any more detail in respect of their composition, their glass transition temperature Tg or the amount of reactive functional groups for thermal crosslinking they contain.",
        "Furthermore, the dual-cure coating material may comprise, inter alia, blocked polyisocyanates as constituent (a7). There is no reference to the fact that, from the many proposed blocked polyisocyanates, those to be selected are polyisocyanates which contain at least one soft, flexibilizing segment as a molecule building block.",
        "The clearcoats produced with the aid of the known dual-cure clearcoat materials exhibit good scratch resistance, intercoat adhesion, weathering stability and chemical stability, and also an outstanding profile of optical properties.",
        "A comparable dual-cure coating material is known from the German patent application DE 199 20 801 A1. As far as the thermally curable (meth)acrylate copolymers are concerned, all that is stated is that their amount should in general not exceed 40% by weight, based on the coating material. The known dual-cure coating material is used to produce multicoat clearcoat systems which are highly scratch resistant, weathering stable, yellowing free, hard, flexible, and free from surface defects, on all substrates, and which have a high level of adhesion within the clearcoat systems and can be produced in the high film thickness necessary for an outstanding overall appearance. To this end, a film of the dual-cure coating material is overcoated with a further film of the dual-cure coating material that contains nanoparticles, after which the two films are cured together. However, this process is comparatively complex.",
        "The dual-cure powder slurries known to date, and the coatings produced from them, thus have an entirely advantageous profile of properties, which should be retained.",
        "In a continuous coating process, however, such as, for example, in continuous operation in the paint shop of a motor vehicle plant, the dual-cure powder slurries exhibit certain weaknesses. In these paint shops, the applied dual-cure powder slurry films on the bodies are first of all dried and thermally cured at relatively high temperatures, immediately following which\u2014ideally without substantial cooling\u2014they are cured using UV radiation.",
        "Since the bodies represent three-dimensional substrates of complex shape, they have numerous shadow zones, such as cavities, folds, and other structural undercuts or edges. Optimum, in particular complete, exposure of the shadow zones to UV radiation is, however, highly complex in terms of apparatus and control technology, and is also time-consuming, since it has to be done using\u2014additionally\u2014pointwise, small-area and all-round emitters in conjunction with automatic movement means.",
        "Unless optimum exposure is achieved, however, it has to date been necessary to accept that the resulting coatings or finishes will have an unsatisfactory profile of performance properties in the shadow zones. In particular, they do not attain the scratch resistance and chemical resistance of the fully cured coatings or finishes outside the shadow zones. This may cause problems not only during the subsequent use of the motor vehicles but indeed also in the course of the further painting process in the paint shop and during the further manufacturing process: for example, when installing seats, doors, windows, electrical components, and motors into the painted bodies. The finishes may easily be damaged by mechanical and chemical exposure.",
        "The problems depicted above also occur with the dual-cure sealing compounds and adhesives of the prior art and with the seals and adhesive films produced from them.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide novel dual-cure powder slurries which are easy to prepare and have outstanding application properties. The novel dual-cure powder slurries should provide coatings, adhesive films and seals, especially coatings, such as clearcoats, single-coat or multicoat color and/or effect coating systems, and combination effect coats, which match, if not indeed exceed, the profile of performance properties of the prior art coatings, adhesive films and seals. On and in three-dimensional substrates of complex shape, they should exhibit a good profile of performance properties, especially as regards scratch resistance and chemical resistance, in particular in continuous operation, and even where exposure of the shadow zones to actinic radiation is less than ideal, in particular incomplete, so that the apparatus and measurement and control technology involved in curing with actinic radiation may be simplified and the process time shortened.",
        "The invention accordingly provides the novel powder slurries curable thermally and with actinic radiation and comprising highly viscous and/or solid particles dimensionally stable under storage and application conditions, comprising\n\n    (A) a binder free of carbon-carbon double bonds activatable with actinic radiation, comprising at least one (meth)acrylate copolymer containing on average per molecule at least one isocyanate-reactive functional group and at least one ion-forming group,\n    (B) at least one blocked and/or part-blocked polyisocyanate, and\n    (C) at least one olefinically unsaturated constituent which is free of isocyanate-reactive functional groups and contains on average per molecule more than four carbon-carbon double bonds activatable with actinic radiation.",
        "In the light of the prior art it is surprising, and was not foreseeable for the skilled worker, that the object on which the invention is based might be achieved by means of the novel dual-cure powder slurries.",
        "A particular surprise was that the novel dual-cure powder slurries gave coatings, adhesive films and seals, especially coatings, such as clearcoats, single-coat or multicoat, color and/or effect coating systems, and combination effect coats which matched, if not indeed exceeded, the profile of performance properties of the prior art coatings, adhesive films and seals.",
        "Even more of a surprise was that on and in three-dimensional substrates of complex shape, and especially in continuous operation and even with less than optimum, in particular incomplete, exposure of the shadow zones to actinic radiation, they gave coatings, adhesive films and seals which had a good profile of performance properties, especially as regards scratch resistance and chemical resistance, so that the apparatus and measurement and control technology involved in curing with actinic radiation could be simplified and the process time shortened.",
        "Another particular surprise was the broad applicability of the novel dual-cure powder slurries in a very wide variety of fields of use.",
        "The novel dual-cure powder slurries comprise particles which are solid and/or highly viscous and dimensionally stable under storage and application conditions.",
        "In the context of the present invention, \u201chighly viscous\u201d means that, under the customary and known conditions of storage and application of powder slurries, the particles behave substantially like solid particles.",
        "The particles are also dimensionally stable. In the context of the present invention, \u201cdimensionally stable\u201d means that, under the customary and known conditions of storage and application of aqueous dispersions or powder slurries, the particles neither agglomerate nor break down into smaller particles but instead substantially retain their original form, even on exposure to shear forces.",
        "Preferably, the novel dual-cure powder slurries are free of organic solvents. In the context of the present invention this means that they have a residual volatile solvent content of <10% by weight, preferably <5% by weight, and with particular preference <1% by weight.",
        "In accordance with the invention it is of very particular advantage if the residual content lies below the gas-chromatographic detection limit.",
        "The average particle size of the solid particles is preferably from 0.8 to 20 \u03bcm and with particular preference from 3 to 15 \u03bcm. By average particle size is meant the 50% median value determined in accordance with the laser diffraction method, i.e., 50% of the particles have a particle diameter\u2266the median and 50% of the particles have a particle diameter\u2267the median.",
        "The novel dual-cure powder slurries comprising particles having such average particle sizes exhibit better application properties and, at the applied film thicknesses of >30 \u03bcm as currently practiced in the automotive industry for the final finishing of automobiles, show little if any tendency toward popping and mud cracking.",
        "The particle size reaches its upper limit when the particles are unable, owing to their size, to flow out fully on baking, with the consequence of adverse effects on film leveling. Where appearance requirements are not so critical, the particle size may, however, also be higher 30 \u03bcm is considered a rational upper limit, since above this particle size it becomes more likely that the spray nozzles and conveying units of the highly sensitive application equipment will become clogged.",
        "Preferably, the preferred particle sizes described above are obtained, even without the aid of additional external emulsifiers, if the particles overall contain an amount of ion-forming groups that corresponds to an average acid number or amine number of from 3 to 56 g KOH/g solids (MEQ acid or amine of from 0.05 to 1.0 meq/g solids), preferably up to 28 (MEQ acid or amine: 0.5) and in particular up to 17 (MEQ acid or amine: 0.3).",
        "It is of advantage if the ion-forming groups are present exclusively or predominantly, i.e. to an extent of more than 50, especially more than 70 mol %, in the below-described binders (A).",
        "It is preferred to aim for a low amount of such groups, generally speaking since free groups of this kind remain in the cured coating and may lessen its resistance to environmental substances and chemicals. On the other hand, the amount of such groups must still be high enough to ensure the desired stabilization.",
        "Using neutralizing agents, the ion-forming groups are neutralized 100% or else partially neutralized (<100% neutralized). The amount of neutralizing agent is chosen such that the MEQ value of the novel dual-cure powder slurry is situated below 1, preferably below 0.5 and in particular below 0.3 meq/g solids. It is of advantage if the amount of neutralizing agent corresponds at least to an MEQ value of 0.05 meq/g solids.",
        "Suitable anion-forming groups include acid groups such as carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid or phosphonic acid groups. Accordingly, neutralizing agents used include bases, such as alkali metal hydroxides, ammonia or amines. Alkali metal hydroxides can be used only to a limited extent, since the alkali metal ions are not volatile on baking and, owing to their incompatibility with organic substances, may cloud the film and lead to loss of gloss. Consequently, ammonia or amines are preferred. In the case of amines, water-soluble tertiary amines are preferred. By way of example, mention may be made of N,N-dimethylethanolamine or aminomethylpropanolamine (AMP).",
        "Suitable cation-forming groups include primary, secondary or tertiary amines. Accordingly, neutralizing agents used include, in particular, low molecular mass organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid or lactic acid.",
        "For the preferred use of the novel dual-cure powder slurries as dual-cure coating materials, adhesives or sealing compounds, acid groups are preferred as ion-forming groups, since the coatings, adhesive films or seals produced therefrom generally have better resistance to yellowing than the coatings, adhesive films and seals produced from the novel dual-cure powder slurries based on particles containing cationic groups.",
        "Nevertheless, cationic particles containing groups convertible into cations, such as amino groups, are likewise suitable for use in principle, provided the field of use tolerates their typical secondary properties such as their tendency to yellow.",
        "The first key constituent of the novel dual-cure powder slurries is a binder (A) which is free of carbon-carbon double bonds activatable with actinic radiation. In the context of the present invention, \u201cfree of carbon-carbon double bonds\u201d means that the binders (A) in question contain no, or only technically occasioned traces of such double bonds.",
        "The binder (A) contains at least one, preferably at least two, (meth) acrylate copolymer(s) (A) containing on average per molecule at least one, preferably at least two, with particular preference at least three, and in particular at least four isocyanate-reactive functional groups and at least one, preferably at least two, and in particular at least three ion-forming groups.",
        "Examples of suitable isocyanate-reactive functional groups are thiol, hydroxyl and primary and secondary amino groups, especially hydroxyl groups.",
        "Examples of suitable ion-forming groups are those described above.",
        "The (meth)acrylate copolymer (A) or the mixture of at least two (meth)acrylate copolymers (A) preferably has a glass transition temperature Tg of from \u221240 to +80\u00b0 C.",
        "Where only one (meth)acrylate copolymer (A) is used, it may have a low or a high glass transition temperature Tg within the stated temperature range. The (meth)acrylate copolymer (A) preferably has a low glass transition temperature Tg, preferably below room temperature, in particular below 0\u00b0 C.",
        "In one preferred embodiment the binder (A) comprises at least one, especially one, (meth)acrylate copolymer (A1) and at least one, especially one, (meth)acrylate copolymer (A2), or the binder consists of these (meth) acrylate copolymers (A1) and (A2)",
        "The (meth)acrylate copolymer (A1) contains on average per molecule at least one, preferably at least two, with particular preference at least three, and in particular at least four isocyanate-reactive functional groups and has a glass transition temperature Tg below room temperature, preferably below 0, more preferably below \u22125, with particular preference below \u221210, with very particular preference below \u221215, and in particular below \u221220\u00b0 C.",
        "The (meth)acrylate copolymer (A2) contains on average per molecule at least one, preferably at least two, with particular preference at least three, and in particular at least four isocyanate-reactive functional groups and has a glass transition temperature Tg above room temperature, preferably above 30, more preferably above 32, very preferably above 35, with particular preference above 40, with very particular preference above 42, and in particular above 45\u00b0 C.",
        "Examples of suitable isocyanate-reactive groups for use in the (meth)acrylate copolymers (A1) and (A2) are those described above. The (meth)acrylate copolymers (A1) and (A2) may contain different or identical isocyanate-reactive groups, or combinations of isocyanate-reactive groups, with the number of isocyanate-reactive groups in the (meth)acrylate copolymers (A1), on the one hand, and in the (meth)acrylate copolymers (A2), on the other hand, being identical or different. For example, the (meth)acrylate copolymers (A1) may contain hydroxyl groups and the (meth)acrylate copolymers (A2) may contain secondary and/or primary amino groups. Numerous further permutations are conceivable here, and are easy for the skilled worker to infer, so that there is no need to go into this in detail here.",
        "Preferably, hydroxyl groups are used.",
        "The hydroxyl content of the (meth)acrylate copolymers (A1) and (A2) may vary widely. The lower limit is a result of the proviso that there must be at least one hydroxyl group in the (meth)acrylate copolymers (A1) and (A2). The hydroxyl number is preferably from 50 to 300, more preferably from 80 to 250, very preferably from 100 to 220, with particular preference from 120 to 200, with very particular preference from 140 to 190, and in particular from 150 to 185 mg KOH/g.",
        "The (meth)acrylate copolymers (A1) and (A2) preferably have an acid number of from 3 to 70, more preferably from 3 to 65, with particular preference from 5 to 60, with very particular preference from 7 to 55, in particular from 10 to 50, and especially from 12 to 45 mg KOH/g. It is possible for one of the (meth)acrylate copolymers, (A1) or (A2), to have an acid number of 0 or near to 0 mg KOH/g, while the other (meth)acrylate copolymer, (A2) or (A1), has an acid number>0 mg KOH/g, provided the (meth)acrylate copolymer (A) free of acid groups is dispersed along with the one containing acid groups. Preferably, the (meth)acrylate copolymers (A1) and (A2) have the same, or approximately the same, acid number.",
        "The weight ratio of (meth)acrylate copolymer (A1) to (meth)acrylate copolymer (A2) may vary widely from one binder (A) to another. Preferably, the weight ratio of (A1) to (A2) is from 1:10 to 10:1, more preferably from 1:8 to 8:1, with particular preference from 1:6 to 6:1, with very particular preference from 1:4 to 4:1, and in particular from 1:2 to 2:1.",
        "It is a particular advantage of the novel dual-cure powder slurries that the above-described (meth)acrylate copolymers (A1) and (A2) may also be used individually as binders (A) without any risk of this lessening the advantageous technical effect aimed at in accordance with the invention. Indeed, it is a further, very particular advantage of the novel dual-cure powder slurries that any, possibly unwanted change in the profile of properties which may be induced by the choice of the binder (A) can easily be compensated, or even overcompensated, by appropriate selection of the blocked and/or part-blocked polyisocyanates (B) described below and/or of the olefinically unsaturated constituents (C) described below.",
        "The above-described (meth)acrylate copolymers (A), including the (meth)acrylate copolymers (A1) and (A2), are prepared by free-radical copolymerization of at least two, preferably at least three and in particular at least four different olefinically unsaturated monomers (a).",
        "One of the monomers (a) is an olefinically unsaturated monomer (a1) by means of which the isocyanate-reactive functional groups are introduced into the (meth)acrylate copolymers (A). At least one of the other monomers (a) substantially comprises olefinically unsaturated monomers (a2) containing no isocyanate-reactive functional groups. These monomers (a2) may be free of reactive functional groups or may contain reactive functional groups which are able to undergo thermal crosslinking reactions with other, complementary reactive functional groups, with the exception of isocyanate groups.",
        "Examples of suitable olefinically unsaturated monomers (a1) are\n\n    hydroxyalkyl esters of alpha,beta-olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as hydroxyalkyl esters of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and ethacrylic acid in which the hydroxyalkyl group contains up to 20 carbon atoms, such as 2-hydroxyethyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, 3-hydroxypropyl, 3-hydroxybutyl, 4-hydroxybutyl acrylate, methacrylate or ethacrylate; 1,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexane, octahydro-4,7-methano-1H-idenedimethanol or methylpropanediol monoacrylate, monomethacrylate, monoethacrylate or monocrotonate; or reaction products of cyclic esters, such as epsilon-caprolactone, and these hydroxyalkyl esters;\n    olefinically unsaturated alcohols such as allyl alcohol;\n    allyl ethers of polyols, such as trimethylolpropane monoallyl ether or pentaerythritol monoallyl, diallyl or triallyl ether.

In this case too, the amounts of chain extender, isocyanate and compound are chosen so that the equivalents ratio of the NCO groups to the isocyanate-reactive groups of the chain extender is between 3:1 and 1:2, and is preferably 2:1, and the equivalents ratio of the remaining NCO groups to the isocyanate-reactive groups of the compound is 1:1. Of course, all forms lying between these two processes are also possible. For example, some of the isocyanate groups of a diisocyanate may first be reacted with a diol as chain extender, after which a further portion of the isocyanate groups may be reacted with the compound, especially the hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate, and subsequently the remaining isocyanate groups may be reacted with a diamine as chain extender.",

Especially suitable lightfast organic dyes (D) are those having little or no tendency to migrate from the coatings, adhesive films and seals produced from the novel dual-cure powder slurries.

        "The novel dual-cure powder slurries preferably comprise nonionic and ionic thickeners (D), thereby effectively countering the tendency of the comparatively large solid and/or highly viscous particles to undergo sedimentation.",
        "Examples of nonionic thickeners (D) are hydroxyethylcellulose and polyvinyl alcohols.",
        "Thickeners known as nonionic associative thickeners (D) are likewise available commercially in a diverse selection. They generally consist of water-dilutable polyurethanes, the reaction products of water-soluble polyetherdiols, aliphatic diisocyanates and monofunctional hydroxy compounds with an organophilic radical.",
        "Likewise commercially available are ionic thickeners (D). These normally include anionic groups and are based in particular on specific polyacrylate resins possessing acid groups, some or all of which may have been neutralized.",

        "For the novel dual-cure powder slurries it is advantageous that both of the above-described types of thickener (D) are present therein. The amount of the thickeners to be added and the ratio of ionic to nonionic thickener is guided by the desired viscosity of the slurry of the invention, which in turn is predetermined by the required sedimentation stability and by the specific needs of spray application. The skilled worker will therefore be able to determine the amount of the thickeners and the ratio of the types of thickener to one another on the basis of simple deliberations, with the assistance, if necessary, of preliminary tests.",
        "Preference is given to a viscosity range from 50 to 1500 mPas at a shear rate of 1000 s\u22121 and from 150 to 8000 mPas at a shear rate of 10 s\u22121, and also from 180 to 12,000 mPas at a shear rate of 1 s\u22121.",
        "This viscosity behavior, known as \u201cpseudoplasticity\u201d, describes a state which does justice both to the requirements of spray application, on the one hand, and to the requirements in terms of storage stability and sedimentation stability, on the other: in the state of motion, such as when pumping the novel dual-cure powder slurries in circulation in the ring circuit of the paint shop and when spraying, for example, the novel dual-cure powder slurries adopt a state of low viscosity which ensures easy processability. Without shear stress, on the other hand, the viscosity rises and thus ensures that dual-cure coating materials, adhesives or sealing compounds present, following application, on the substrates to be coated, bonded and/or sealed have a reduced tendency to form runs on vertical surfaces. In the same way, a result of the higher viscosity in the stationary state, such as during storage, for instance, is that sedimentation of the solid and/or highly viscous particles is very largely prevented, or that any slight degree of settling of the novel dual-cure powder slurries during the storage period may be removed again by agitation.",
        "For the usefulness of the above-described additives (D) it is important that the glass transition temperature Tg or the minimum film formation temperature (MFFT) (cf. Lexikon Lacke und Druckfarben, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, N.Y., 1998, p. 391, \u201cMinimum film formation temperature\u201d) of the particles of the novel dual-cure powder slurries is not lowered to such an extent by said additives (D) that the slurries coagulate.",
        "The solids content of the novel dual-cure powder slurries may vary very widely. The content is preferably from 10 to 80, more preferably from 12 to 75, with particular preference from 14 to 70, with very particular preference from 16 to 65, and in particular from 18 to 60% by weight, based in each case on the novel dual-cure powder slurry.",
        "The preparation of the novel dual-cure powder slurries from the above-described constituents has no special features in terms of its method but instead takes place substantially as described in detail in the patent applications DE 195 40 977 A1, DE 195 18 392 A1, DE 196 17 086 A1, DE-A-196 13 547, DE 196 18 657 A1, DE 196 52 813 A1, DE 196 17 086 A1, DE-A-198 14 471 A1, DE 198 41 842 A1 and DE 198 41 408 A1, except that in the context of the present invention pigments and/or fillers (D) may be processed as well.",
        "In a first preferred variant of the preparation, the starting point is a pigmented powder coating material which is prepared as in the product information from BASF Lacke+Farben AG, \u201cPulverlacke\u201d [Powder coatings], 1990, or in the BASF Coatings AG brochure \u201cPulverlacke, Pulverlacke f\u00fcr industrielle Anwendungen\u201d [Powder coatings, powder coating materials for industrial applications], January 2000, by homogenizing and dispersing, by means for example of an extruder or screw kneading apparatus, and grinding. Following the preparation of the powder coating materials, they are prepared for dispersion by further grinding and, if appropriate, by classifying and sieving.",
        "The aqueous powder coating dispersion can then be prepared from the powder coating material by wet grinding or by stirred incorporation of dry-ground powder coating material. Particular preference is given to wet grinding. The novel dual-cure powder slurry is then filtered prior to its further processing.",
        "It is of advantage in accordance with the invention to prepare the novel dual-cure powder slurries with the aid of the secondary dispersion process described in the German patent application DE 199 08 018 A1 on page 15 lines 37 to 65 or in the German patent application DE 199 08 013 A1 in column 4 lines 22 to 40 and column 12 line 38 to column 13 line 23.",
        "The particles of the dual-cure powder slurries may also be mechanically comminuted in the wet state, which is referred to as wet grinding. In this case it is preferred to employ conditions such that the temperature of the material being ground does not exceed 70\u00b0 C., preferably 60\u00b0 C., and in particular 50\u00b0 C. Preferably, the specific energy input during the grinding process is from 10 to 1000, more preferably from 15 to 750, and in particular from 20 to 500 Wh/g.",
        "For wet grinding it is possible to employ a very wide variety of equipment which produces high or low shear fields.",
        "Examples of suitable equipment which produces low shear fields are customary and known stirred tanks, slot homogenizers, microfluidizers or dissolvers.",
        "Examples of suitable equipment which produces high shear fields are customary and known stirred mills or inline dissolvers.",
        "Particular preference is given to employing the equipment which produces high shear fields. Among such equipment, the stirred mills are particularly advantageous in accordance with the invention and are therefore used with very particular preference.",
        "During wet grinding, generally, the novel dual-cure powder slurry is supplied to the above-described equipment, and circulated therein, by means of appropriate devices, such as pumps, until the desired particle size is reached.",
        "For energy reasons it is particularly advantageous if the novel dual-cure powder slurry to be ground contains only a portion, preferably from 5 to 90, more preferably from 10 to 80 and in particular from 20 to 70% by weight, of the above-described thickeners (D) that are to be introduced into it. Where this variant of the preferred process is employed, the remaining amount of thickener (D) is to be added after wet grinding.",
        "Preferably, the novel dual-cure powder slurries are prepared in the absence of actinic radiation, in order to prevent premature crosslinking of, or other damage to, the novel dual-cure powder slurries.",
        "The novel dual-cure powder slurries are outstandingly suitable as, or to prepare, dual-cure coating materials, adhesives and sealing compounds.",
        "The novel dual-cure coating materials are outstandingly suitable for the production of single-coat or multicoat, color and/or effect, electrically conductive, magnetically shielding or fluorescent coatings, such as primer-surfacer coats, basecoats, solid-color topcoats or combination effect coats, or of single-coat or multicoat clearcoats.",
        "The dual-cure adhesives of the invention are outstandingly suitable for producing adhesive films, and the dual-cure sealing compounds of the invention are outstandingly suitable for producing seals.",
        "Very particular advantages result when the novel dual-cure coating materials are used as clearcoat materials for producing single-coat or multicoat clearcoats. In particular, the novel dual-cure clearcoat materials are used to produce multicoat color and/or effect coating systems by the wet-on-wet technique, in which a basecoat material, especially an aqueous basecoat material, is applied to the surface of the substrate, after which the resulting basecoat film is dried, without-being cured, and is overcoated with a clearcoat film. Subsequently, the two films are cured together.",
        "In terms of method, the application of the novel dual-cure coating materials, adhesives and sealing compounds has no special features, but may instead take place by any customary application method, such as spraying, knifecoating, brushing, flow coating, dipping, trickling or rolling, for example. In the case of the dual-cure coating materials of the invention it is preferred to employ spray application methods, such as compressed air spraying, airless spraying, high-speed rotation, electrostatic spray application (ESTA), alone or in conjunction with hot spray applications such as hot air spraying, for example. Preferably, application takes place in the absence of daylight, in order to prevent premature crosslinking of the novel dual-cure powder slurries.",
        "Suitable substrates are all those whose surface is undamaged by the conjoint use of actinic radiation and heat for curing the dual-cure films present thereon. The substrates preferably consist of metals, plastics, wood, ceramic, stone, textile, fiber composites, leather, glass, glass fibers, glass wool and rockwool, mineral-bound and resin-bound building materials, such as plasterboard and cement slabs or roof tiles, and composites of these materials.",
        "Accordingly, the novel dual-cure coating materials, adhesives and sealing compounds are not only outstandingly suitable for applications in the fields of automotive OEM finishing and automotive refinish, but are also suitable for the coating, bonding and sealing of buildings, inside and out, and of doors, windows and furniture, for industrial coating, including coil coating, container coating and the impregnation and/or coating of electrical components, and also for the coating of white goods, including domestic appliances, boilers and radiators. In the context of industrial coatings, they are suitable for coating, bonding or sealing of virtually all parts and articles for private or industrial use, such as domestic appliances, small metal parts such as nuts and bolts, hubcaps, wheel rims, packaging, or electrical components, such as motor windings or transformer windings (electrical wound goods).",
        "In the case of electrically conductive substrates, it is possible to use primers which are prepared in a customary and known manner from electrodeposition coating materials. Both anodic and cathodic electrodeposition coating materials are suitable for this purpose, but especially cathodic electrodeposition coating materials. Nonfunctionalized and/or nonpolar plastics surfaces may be subjected prior to coating in a known manner to a pretreatment, such as with a plasma or by flaming, or provided with a water-based primer.",
        "The thermal curing of the applied dual-cure mixtures of the invention also has no special features in terms of its method but instead takes place in accordance with the customary and known thermal methods, such as heating in a forced air oven or irradiation using IR lamps.",
        "Suitable radiation sources for curing with actinic radiation are sources such as high or low pressure mercury vapor lamps, with or without lead doping in order to open up a radiation window of up to 405 nm, or electron beam sources. Further examples of suitable processes and equipment for curing with actinic radiation are described in the German patent application DE 198 18 735 A1, column 10 line 31 to column 12 line 22. Preference is given to the use of a continuous UV unit from IST.",
        "The resulting coatings, especially the single-coat or multicoat color and/or effect coatings and clearcoats of the invention, are easy to produce and have outstanding optical properties and very high light stability, chemical resistance, water resistance and weathering stability. In particular, they are free from clouding and inhomogeneities. Moreover, they are hard, flexible and scratch resistant. They possess outstanding intercoat adhesion and good to very good adhesion to automotive refinishes and to automotive production-line repair finishes. As is known, in the case of automotive production-line repair finishing, the ready-painted bodies are coated once again with the OEM finishes.",
        "The adhesive films connect a very wide variety of substrates to one another firmly and durably and have a high chemical and mechanical stability even at extreme temperatures and/or with extreme temperature fluctuations.",
        "Similarly, the seals provide durable sealing of the substrates, and exhibit high mechanical and chemical stability even under extreme temperatures and/or temperature fluctuations, and even in conjunction with exposure to aggressive chemicals.",
        "It is, however, a very important advantage of the novel dual-cure powder slurries and of the novel dual-cure coating materials, adhesives and sealing compounds that, even in the shadow zones of three-dimensional substrates of complex shape, such as vehicle bodies, radiators or electrical wound goods, and even without optimum, especially complete, exposure of the shadow zones to actinic radiation, they give coatings, adhesive films and seals whose profile of performance properties at least comes close to that of the coatings, adhesive films and seals outside the shadow zones. As a result, the coatings, adhesives and seals present in the shadow zones are also no longer readily damaged by mechanical and/or chemical exposure.",
        "Accordingly, the primed or unprimed substrates commonly employed in the technological fields recited above and coated with at least one novel coating, bonded with at least one novel adhesive film and/or sealed with at least one novel coating combine a particularly advantageous profile of performance properties with a particularly long service life, which makes them particularly attractive economically.",
        "The Preparation of a Methacrylate Copolymer (A1)",
        "A suitable laboratory reactor equipped with stirrer, reflux condenser, thermometer, nitrogen inlet pipe and two feed vessels was charged with 895 parts by weight of methyl ethyl ketone and this initial charge was heated to 80\u00b0 C. Subsequently, from the first feed vessel, a monomer mixture of 424 parts by weight of ethylhexy acrylate, 95 parts by weight of styrene, 257 parts by weight of hydroxyethyl methacrylate and 143 parts by weight of 4-hydroxybutyl acrylate and 34 parts by weight of acrylic acid was metered in over the course of four hours, and from the second feed vessel a solution of 95 parts by weight of tert-butyl peroxyethylhexanoate and 57 parts by weight of methyl ethyl ketone was metered in over the course of four and a half hours, both feeds taking place at a uniform rate and with stirring. The feeds were commenced simultaneously. After the end of the second feed (initiator feed), the reaction mixture was polymerized at 80\u00b0 C. for two hours more. This gave a solution of the methacrylate copolymer (A1) having a solids content of 52% by weight (one hour/130\u00b0 C.) with an acid number of 24.3 mg KOH/g solids and a hydroxyl number of 175 mg KOH/g solids. The methacrylate copolymer (A1) had a glass transition temperature, Tg, of \u221222\u00b0 C.",
        "The Preparation of a Methacrylate Copolymer (A2)",
        "Preparation example 1 was repeated except that 889 parts by weight of methyl ethyl ketone were used as the initial charge and the initiator feed added was a solution of 66 parts by weight of tert-butyl peroxyethylhexanoate and 87 parts by weight of methyl ethyl ketone, and was added over 6.5 hours, and the monomer feed used was a monomer mixture of 146 parts by weight of styrene, 459 parts by weight of tert-butyl acrylate, 219 parts by weight of n-butyl methacrylate, 583 parts by weight of hydroxypropyl methacrylate and 51 parts by weight of acrylic acid. This gave a solution of the methacrylate copolymer (A2) having a solids content of 58.6% by weight (one hour/130\u00b0 C.) with an acid number of 27.5 mg KOH/g solids and a hydroxyl number of 156 mg KOH/g solids. The methacrylate copolymer (A2) had a glass transition temperature, Tg, of +65\u00b0 C.",
        "The Preparation of a Blocked Polyisocyanate (B)",
        "A suitable laboratory reactor equipped with stirrer, reflux condenser, thermometer and nitrogen inlet pipe was charged with 1068 parts by weight of an isocyanurate-type trimer of hexamethylene diisocyanate (Desmodur\u00ae N 3300 from Bayer AG) and 380 parts by weight of methyl ethyl ketone and this initial charge was slowly heated to 40\u00b0 C. Thereafter, a total of 532 parts by weight of 3,5-dimethylpyrazole were added in portions in such a way that the temperature of the reaction mixture did not rise higher than 80\u00b0 C. The reaction mixture was held at 80\u00b0 C. until free isocyanate was no longer detectable, and then cooled. The resulting solution of the blocked polyisocyanate (B) had a solids content of 80% by weight.",
        "The Preparation of the Novel Dual-cure Powder Slurry",
        "A suitable glass stirred vessel equipped with a high-speed stirrer was charged with 395 parts by weight of the solution of the methacrylate copolymer (A2) from preparation example 2, 490 parts by weight of the solution of the methacrylate copolymer (A1) from preparation example 1, 449 parts by weight of the solution of the blocked polyisocyanate (B) from preparation example 3, 236 parts by weight of an aliphatic urethane acrylate based on isophorone diisocyanate and containing 6 acrylate groups in the molecule (Ebecryl\u00ae 1290 from UCB, Belgium) and 22 parts by weight of dimethylethanolamine, and these components were mixed intensively with one another. To the resulting mixture there were added 9.4 parts by weight of a photoinitiator mixture consisting of Irgacure\u00ae 184 and Irgacure\u00ae 819 in a weight ratio of 7:1, 11.1 parts by weight of a commercially customary UV absorber and 11.1 parts by weight of a commercially customary reversible free-radical scavenger (HALS), and these components were likewise thoroughly mixed.",
        "To this organic phase there were added, slowly and with stirring, 1775 parts by weight of water. The methyl ethyl ketone was subsequently removed by vacuum distillation at not more than 35\u00b0 C.",
        "The novel dual-cure powder slurry was completed by adding 1.5 parts by weight of a commercially customary leveling agent and also 8.8 parts by weight of Optiflo\u00ae L100, 26.4 parts by weight of Optiflo\u00ae M 200 and 8.8 parts by weight of Optiflo\u00ae M 210 (commercial thickeners from S\u00fcd Chemie).",
        "The novel dual-cure powder slurry was storage-stable and easy to apply.",
        "The Production of a Multicoat Color Coating System Using the Novel Dual-cure Powder Slurry",
        "The novel dual-cure powder slurry of example 1 was applied pneumatically using a gravity-feed gun to steel panels which had been precoated with a black aqueous basecoat material. The wet film thickness of the applied films was from 30 to 40 \u03bcm. Following a flashoff time of 5 minutes at 23\u00b0 C., the applied films were cured both under dual-cure conditions and under purely thermal conditions in order to simulate the curing in the shadow zones of three-dimensional substrates of complex shape.",
        "For the thermal curing, forced air ovens from Binder and from Heraeus were used. The temperatures reported refer to the circulating air.",
        "The radiation curing was carried out using a continuous UV unit from IST. Irradiation was carried out under atmospheric air. The radiation dose was determined immediately prior to curing, using a commercially customary dosimeter, and, where necessary, was varied by altering the belt speed. The radiation source was a medium-pressure mercury vapor lamp.",
        "In order to simulate the continuous dual-cure coating and curing process involved in the production of automobiles, the coated steel panels were transferred within a very short time (no more than ten seconds) from the forced air oven, which was regulated at a temperature of 120\u00b0 C., to the continuous UV unit. The cooling of the coated steel panels that occurred under these conditions was measured using a contact thermometer. It was not more than 20\u00b0 C.",
        "For the dual cure, the following conditions were employed:\n\n    drying: 10 minutes at room temperature, 5 minutes at 60\u00b0 C., 7 minutes at 120\u00b0 C.; UV curing: dose 3 J/cm2; thermal curing: 30 minutes at 155\u00b0 C.",
        "For the purely thermal cure, the following conditions were employed:\n\n    drying: 10 minutes at room temperature, 5 minutes at 60\u00b0 C., 7 minutes at 120\u00b0 C.; curing: 30 minutes at 155\u00b0 C.",
        "The scratch resistance of the resulting multicoat systems was determined with the aid of the Amtec-Kistler test, which is known in the art. 1.5 g/l ultrafine quartz flour Sikron SH 200 were used. The parameter measured was the loss of gloss at 20\u00b0 C. following cleaning with petroleum washing spirit.",
        "The chemical resistance was determined by means of the gradient oven test, known in the art, in accordance with DaimlerChrysler PBODDC371. The temperatures recorded were those above which the applied chemicals left visible damage in the multicoat systems.",
        "The results of the tests are given in the table.",
        "The results in the table underline the fact that the novel dual-cure powder slurry gave coatings, even in the shadow zones (simulated by the purely thermal curing), whose scratch resistance and, chemical stability matched that of coatings outside the shadow zones.",
