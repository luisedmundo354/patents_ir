        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The invention relates to a network print system and its printing method of proposing substitute means which is used in the case where a printing apparatus cannot realize setting of print set information when printed matter is outputted by the printing apparatus in a print shop which is connected via the Internet on the basis of the print set information such as picture quality, post-process, and the like on the basis of document information such as an image, characters, and the like.",
        "2. Related Background Art",
        "In the conventional technique, when document information and print set information stored in a server are downloaded into a print shop via the Internet and printed matter is outputted, if a printing apparatus provided in the print shop can realize print setting (for example, color print, resolution is set to 1200 dpi, and post-processing function is set to corner binding) shown by the print set information, the printing apparatus in the print shop outputs the printed matter in accordance with the print setting. If the printing apparatus provided in the print shop cannot realize print setting shown by the print set information, one of the following operations is selected: (1) the print is executed without using the print set information; (2) the print is executed in accordance with print setting which has newly been set by the user; and (3) the most similar print setting is presented to the user on the basis of the print set information and the user can determine whether he prints or not.",
        "However, the user often feels that it is tiring to decide the print setting. There is a possibility that the user who is weak in execution of the print setting performs print setting which is quite different from the print set information. Completely different printed matter is outputted in such a case.",
        "When the most similar print setting is presented to the user, there is a case where similarity is not sufficient. Even if a print system determines that the print setting is most similar to the print setting shown by the downloaded print set information, the user does not always judge in a manner similar to the above. Even if the user judged in a manner similar to the above, at that time, the user does not always demand to output printed matter by the print setting that is most similar to the print setting shown by the downloaded print set information. Therefore, even if the print setting that is most similar to the print setting shown by the print set information is merely presented to the user, the needs of the user cannot be met.",
        "The invention is made in consideration of the foregoing problems. When a printing apparatus in a print shop cannot realize print setting shown by downloaded print set information, more similar substitute print setting can be proposed to the user, or a plurality of substitute print settings are proposed to the user so as to urge him to select a desired one of them, thereby printed matter can be outputted by the desired print setting of the user.",

A user 211 inputs document information 202 to be printed and bookbinding-processed to a PC 204 and selects a bookbinding method at the time of performing the print and the bookbinding process of the document information 202 on a display screen of the PC 204. The PC 204 transmits the document information 202 inputted by the user 211 and bookbinding information 203 showing the bookbinding method selected by the user to the Web server 102 via the Internet 100.",
        "The Web server 102 transmits bar code information 201 corresponding to the received document information 202 and bookbinding information 203 to the PC 204 via the Internet 100.

The Web server 102 manages an access right to the document information 202 and bookbinding information 203 stored in the Web server 102 on the basis of the bar code information 201. The Web server 102 holds a storing device (not shown) which can store the document information 202, bookbinding information 203, and bar code information 201.",
        "If the user 211 wants the print and the bookbinding process, the Web server 102 transmits the document information 202, bookbinding information 203, and bar code information 201 to a local server 214. After the local server 214 received the document information 202, bookbinding information 203, and bar code information 201, it adds the bar code information 201 to the document information. The local server 214 transmits the document information 202 to which the bar code information 201 has been added and the bookbinding information 203 to one of image forming apparatuses 205, 206, 207, and 208 via a local area network (hereinafter, abbreviated to LAN) 215. One of the image forming apparatuses 205 to 208 executes the print and the bookbinding process in accordance with the bookbinding information 203 on the basis of the bar code information 201 and the document information 202, thereby forming a book 209. The user 211 pays a cost 210 including charges for the print and the bookbinding process of the book 209, use charges for the storing device in the Web server 102, and the like.",
        "FIG. 3 shows the book 209 to which the bar code information 201 has been added. The bar code information 201 has been printed onto the last page in the case of a book 300a. The bar code information 201 has been printed onto the back cover in the case of a book 300b.",
        "FIG. 4 is a flowchart showing processes which are executed in a print shop 212 when the user 211 desires to issue the first edition. The user 211 inputs the document information 202 to be printed and bookbinding-processed to the PC 204 existing in the print shop 212 via a media such as a floppy (registered trademark) disk or the like (step S401).",
        "Subsequently, the PC 204 calculates server use charges to use the Web server 102 (S402). The use charges for the Web server 102 are displayed on the PC 204 (S403). The PC 204 discriminates whether the user 211 has approved the displayed use charges or not (S404).",
        "If the user 211 does not approve the displayed use charges for the Web server 102, the PC 204 displays a message to interrupt the print of the printed matter (S411) and finishes the processing routine (S412).",
        "If the user 211 approves the use charges for the displayed Web server 102, he inputs output set data and a property to output the book 209 on the PC 204 (S405). The output set data shows an outputting function of the image forming apparatus for outputting the book 209, for example, a bookbinding form such as monochromatic (black and white) print (hereinafter, simply referred to as a monochro print) or color print, punch, binding, or the like. The property shows an implementor, date/time of the creation, a copyright, use charges for the Web server 102, and the number of issued copies of the first edition.",
        "The PC 204 transmits the inputted output set data and property as bookbinding information to the Web server 102 via the local server 214 and Internet 100 (S406). At the same time, the PC 204 also transmits the document information 202 to the Web server 102. The local server 214 receives the bar code information 201 from the Web server 102 (S407).",
        "Subsequently, when the user 211 inputs the number of books which he wants to output (S408), the local server 214 transmits the bar code information 201, document information 202, and bookbinding information 203 to the image forming apparatus, the bookbinding process is started (S409), and the processing routine is finished (S412).",

        "FIG. 6 is a flowchart showing processes which are executed in the print shop 512 when the user 511 desires a copy of a book. The user 511 allows the bar code information 201 added to the book 209 to be read by using the bar code scanner 516 connected to the PC 504 (S601). The PC 504 transmits the bar code information 201 read by the bar code scanner 516 to the Web server 102 and receives the document information 202 and the bookbinding information 203 (S602).",
        "The PC 504 compares the bookbinding information 203 with the outputting functions of the image forming apparatuses 505 to 508 provided in the print shop 512 (S603).

When the user 511 selects that he does not execute the bookbinding process in the different bookbinding form, the processing routine is finished as it is (S613). When the user 511 selects that the bookbinding process is performed in the different bookbinding form, the PC 504 searches substitute bookbinding forms in place of the bookbinding form shown by the bookbinding information 203 on the basis of the bookbinding information 203 (S606) and sequentially displays a plurality of substitute bookbinding forms to the user 511 from the substitute bookbinding form of the small difference degree (S607).",

If the user 511 selects \u201cre-search\u201d, the PC 504 displays the substitute bookbinding form of the next small difference degree and urges again the user 511 to select. Until the user 511 selects \u201cdecide\u201d, the PC 504 sequentially displays the substitute bookbinding forms from the form of the smaller difference degree (S607). If the user 511 does not select \u201cdecide\u201d even after completion of the display of all of the substitute bookbinding forms, the substitute bookbinding form of the smallest difference degree is displayed again and the above processes are repeated.
