        "In connection with miniaturization of LSI in recent years, miniaturization of logical elements in the LSI is progressing. Accordingly, driving performance of the logic element decreases, and thus a delay failure of the logic element becomes a major cause for a failure of the LSI.",

        "In the mean time, in case of the voltage Va being changed from VH to VL, if the voltage Va is lower than the threshold voltage Vth (H) of the pre-stage P-channel FET 250, the pre-stage P-channel FET 250 is switched from OFF to ON (time t3). As a result, the voltage Vb of the output signal of the pre-stage logic element 230 begins to change from VL to VH. Then, if the voltage Va is lower than the threshold voltage Vth (L) of the pre-stage N-channel FET 260, the pre-stage N-channel FET 260 is switched from ON to OFF and the voltage Vb of the output signal becomes VH.",

As a result, the time from t1 to t2 at which the voltage Vb becomes lower than the threshold voltage Vth (H) of the post-stage P-channel FET 270 becomes longer than that in a normal state. Since the voltage Vc begins to change from VL to VH at the time t2, a delay time of the circuit 220 becomes longer as a result of the time (t2\u2212t1) becomes larger caused by the delay failure.",

Thus, the threshold voltage of each of the pre-stage P-channel type 250 and the post-stage P-channel FET 270 is set to a voltage Vth1 (H).",
        "Then, the first delay time measuring unit 152ameasures a first P-channel side delay time Tp1 when the substrate voltage of the post-stage P-channel FET 270 is set to the first substrate voltage VBBp1 (S510). A method for measuring the delay time Tp1 is described in the following, for example. The clock setting unit 110 sets a clock interval from the time when a clock signal is provided to the FF 200 to the time when a clock signal is provided to the FF 210 based on an instruction of the first delay time measuring unit 152a. The setting vector generating unit 130 generates a setting vector for testing the logic path including the FF 200, the circuit 220, and the FF 210 and provides a signal terminal of the DUT 100 with it. Then, the scan pattern generating unit 140 generates a scan pattern used for a test for a delay failure of the logic path, and provides a scan terminal of the DUT 100 with it to make the DUT 100 operate. The first delay time measuring unit 152a acquires a result of the operation of the DUT 100 from the DUT 100 and compares the result with an expectation value generated by the scan pattern generating unit 140. In case of the result of the operation of the DUT 100 being the same as the expectation value, the clock interval is reduced and then the above steps are repeated. According to the above process, the test apparatus 10 can acquire a minimum clock interval at which the logic path in the DUT 100 operates properly and use it as the delay time Tp1.",
        "Then the second substrate voltage setting unit 122b sets the P-channel side substrate voltage VBBp to the second P-channel side substrate voltage VBBp2 (S520). Thus, the threshold voltage of each of the pre-stage P-channel FET 250 and the post-stage P-channel FET 270 is set to a voltage Vth2 (H). Here, the threshold voltage depends on the substrate voltage as disclosed in Hiroyuki Mizuno, \u201cIncrease of Leak Current Accompanying Low voltage and High-Speed of CMOS LSI and a Technique for Reducing the Leak Current,\u201d Collection of Learned Papers of Electronic Information Communication Society, Electronic Information Communication Society, Vol. J83-C, No. 10, October of 2000, p. 926-935). Therefore, the test apparatus 10 can set the post-stage P-channel FET 270 to a second threshold voltage Vth2 (H) different from the first threshold voltage Vth1 (H) by setting the second substrate voltage VBBp2 different from the first substrate voltage VBBp1.",

In this case, the index a shows a variation in the delay time with respect to the variation of the substrate voltage. Further, the index a is larger In a case where there is a delay failure in one N-channel side FET or there are delay failures in a plurality of N-channel side FET's provided on the logic path, than that in a normal state.",

In other words, the test apparatus 10 can acquire \u0394Td which is an increase in the delay time caused by a delay failure of the pre-stage logic element 230 by the above process and find out a delay failure of the switching by the N-channel FET based on \u0394Td. Further, it is preferable that the reference value is set so that it has a value larger than a variation width of \u0394Td caused by a variance of the process in order to distinguish the delay failure from the variance of the process.",
