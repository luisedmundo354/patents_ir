        "This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/594,608 filed Apr. 22, 2005, and the subject matter thereof is hereby incorporated herein by reference thereto.",
        "The present invention relates generally to packages, and more particularly to a system for a chip-scale-package.",
        "Integrated circuit devices and packages are used in equipment and products including cars, planes, industrial control systems as well as the appliances and devices we typically associate with electronics. The growing numbers of portable electronics, such as cell phones, portable computers, voice recorders, etc, are some of these devices. However, across virtually all the uses for integrated circuit devices, there continues to be a demand for reducing the size and increasing the features or functions as well as the performance. We want more features for less size, weight and cost from the largest equipment to the smallest device. Continued improvement in integrated circuit devices and packages are a significant part of the smaller size, more functions and high performance.",
        "As the demand for electronic devices grows, manufacturers are seeking ways to reduce the size and cost of the packaged integrated circuit devices. To meet these needs, packaging technologies are shifting towards smaller dimensions in both the integrated circuit devices and packages. This is driving the demand for smaller integrated circuit device packages and higher I/O pin counts. These smaller packages, such as chip-scale-packages, are scarcely larger than the tiny integrated circuit devices they protect. Unfortunately, this smaller size and the increased functions bring along their own set of problems, many of which have significantly negative effects on the reliability, assembly processes, high volume production and costs of the devices and products in which they are included.",
        "In most chip-scale-packages, a printed circuit board (PCB), film, or lead frame has been used as a base or a substrate. This type of package structure, particularly when using a PCB substrate, has suffered from reliability problems in part due to poor adhesion between molding compounds and the surfaces of the base or substrate. Many chip-scale-packages suffer from poor adhesion between the molding compound and the solder mask of the PCB or film substrate. Similarly, adhesion problems plague the film substrates as well.",
        "As for the lead frame chip-scale-package, attempts for improvements suffer from limitations in increasing the number of the I/O pin counts for the packages. The lead frame types of leads or electrical connections, such as peripheral types of leads, significantly limit the number of the I/O of the package. These packages impose their capacity limitations on the functions of the integrated circuit devices that they contain, rather than address the demands of increasing features and functions.",
        "Many other attempts have been unsuccessful in meeting the demands of continued decreases in size, increases in functions while improving reliability and cost effective volume manufacturing. These attempts at decreasing size and increasing functions have complicated assembly processes. The attempts have also been difficult to apply in the production processes for the chip-scale-packages. The complications and difficulties have had a negative effect on package reliability and costs.",
        "Thus, a need still remains for a micro chip-scale-package system to provide smaller size, increased I/O pin count, improved reliability, simpler assembly processes and easy implementation in high volume production and lower costs. In view of the increasing demand for improved density of integrated circuit devices and their packages, particularly portable electronic products, it is increasingly critical that answers be found to these problems.",
        "Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.",

A portion of the adhesion material 504 may also be removed, substantially exposing the signal I/O pins 122 providing electrical connection to a next level system (not shown) or the system interconnect 426. It has been discovered that the removal of the temporary film 502 provides a package without substrate, such as the micro chip-scale-package system 100.

        "In greater detail, a method to fabricate the micro chip-scale-package system 100, in an embodiment of the present invention, is performed as follows:\n\n    \n    \n        1. Forming the metal pattern 118 on the adhesion material and over the temporary film 502. (FIG. 5)\n        2. Mounting the integrated circuit die 106 over the temporary film 502 having the electrical interconnection 114 between the integrated circuit die 106 and the temporary film 502. (FIG. 1)\n        3. Molding the encapsulant 102 over the integrated circuit die 106 and the electrical interconnection 114 on the temporary film 502. (FIG. 1)\n        4. Removing the temporary film 502 and substantially exposing the signal I/O pins 122. (FIG. 6)",
        "It has been discovered that the present invention thus has numerous aspects.",
        "An aspect is that the present invention allows the package to be of a smaller size. The thinness of the film or substrate as well as its removal to expose the package pins provides a significantly smaller form factor.",
        "It has been discovered that the disclosed structure provides a more reliable packaged device. The elimination of a solder mask and the substrate provide improved adhesion for the mold compound or encapsulant.",
        "It has also been discovered that the disclosed structure provides for higher I/O pin count. The I/O pin count is not restricted to peripheral leads and the signal I/O pins can be located across the surface area of the package.",
        "Yet another discovery of the disclosed structure is improved performance. The thin z-dimension for the metal pattern provides significantly shorter distances from the top side of the metal pattern to the bottom side of the metal pattern.",
        "Yet another discovery of the disclosed structure is a much simpler assembly process. The materials do not require special handling or processing. The processing steps are also fewer in number and requirements.",
        "Yet another discovery of the disclosed structure is an easily applied to high volume production processes. Existing high volume processes and equipment are directly applicable to the manufacturing requirements.",
        "These and other valuable aspects of the present invention consequently further the state of the technology to at least the next level.",
        "Thus, it has been discovered that the micro chip-scale-package system method and apparatus of the present invention furnish important and heretofore unknown and unavailable solutions, capabilities, and functional aspects. The resulting processes and configurations are straightforward, cost-effective, uncomplicated, highly versatile and effective, can be implemented by adapting known technologies, and are thus readily suited for efficient and economical manufacturing.",
        "While the invention has been described in conjunction with a specific best mode, it is to be understood that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the aforegoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variations, which fall within the scope of the included claims. All matters hithertofore set forth herein or shown in the accompanying drawings are to be interpreted in an illustrative and non-limiting sense."
