        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a method for producing a magnetic recording medium, and particularly to a method for producing a low-noise and high-density coating-type magnetic recording medium.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "For increasing the density of the magnetic recording medium, the method of increasing the tape length (reducing the tape thickness) to increase the volume recording density, and the method of reducing the track width to increase the area recording density have been generally used in many systems as for tape-shaped media.",
        "Consequently, the reduced tape thickness has caused the problem of insufficient edge strength of tapes, thus bringing about a situation in which substrates of materials that have higher strength and are more expensive than conventional products must be used. Also, a servo technique has been developed for accommodating the recently adopted method of reducing the track width, but this technique is difficult to apply particularly in a linear-type system, and the cost of development is considerably be increased.",
        "Methods other than those described above include the method of increasing the linear recording density as a method for increasing the density, but this method has been avoided because of the considerable reduction in C/N (carrier output/noise ratio) associated with short-wave recording.",
        "Recently, an increasing number of systems have adopted high-sensitivity MR heads as playback heads as a method for increasing the density. In this case, reduction of the medium noise and extreme reduction in thickness of the magnetic layer are required for the magnetic recording medium. It can be considered that a finely granulated and uniformly distributed magnetic material is used, and the magnetic material is uniformly dispersed in preparation of a liquid as the method for reducing the medium noise.",
        "In the conventional liquid preparation method, however, the initial contact of the magnetic material with a binder is achieved by a kneader or the like. In this case, since the coagulated magnetic material powder and the solution containing a high concentration of binder are mixed with a high shear force applied thereto, there arise problems such that the wettability of the magnetic material is reduced and hence the dispersibility of the magnetic material is compromised, and the coagulation of the magnetic material formed by kneading cannot be dispersed after it is dispersed, if a magnetic material of fine particles is used. Also, there is a problem that the coagulation of the magnetic material causes not only a noise source but also defects such as seams in coating of an extremely thin magnetic layer.",
        "The object of the present invention is to solve the above problems of the prior art and provide a low-noise high-density coating-type magnetic recording medium.",
        "In order to attain the above-described object, the present invention is directed to a method for producing a magnetic recording medium having a nonmagnetic substrate coated with a magnetic coating material containing a ferromagnetic powder and a binder, wherein: the magnetic coating material contains a liquid A constituted by the ferromagnetic powder and a solvent, and a solution B of the binder; and the liquid A and the solution B are mixed together by applying an ultrasonic wave thereto, and are thereafter subjected to dispersion processing.",
        "According to the present invention, since the liquid A constituted by a ferromagnetic powder and a solvent can be mixed with the solution B of binder by applying the ultrasonic wave thereto, coagulated particles of the ferromagnetic powder can be dispersed and the coagulation of the ferromagnetic powder can be prevented, thus making it possible to obtain a liquid of ferromagnetic powder with uniform adsorption of the binder. As a result, a magnetic coating material suitable for a low-noise high-density coating-type magnetic recording medium is obtained.",
        "That is, as the particle size of the magnetic material decreases, the surface area of the magnetic material increases. Consequently, the ferromagnetic powder more likely coagulates when the raw material is prepared. The coagulated magnetic material has air trapped therein, but it is difficult to remove the air instantaneously when it initially contacts the binder solution because the magnetic material has a large surface area, and thus the surface of the magnetic material is not sufficiently wetted.",
        "Generally, there is the method in which by granulation such as compaction, deaeration in the powder is promoted to improve the wettability at the time of contact with the solution, but the method has a disadvantage that compaction with a fine particle magnetic material causes coagulation that is difficult to dispersed in the subsequent processing of dispersion of the magnetic coating material.",
        "According to the method for preparation of the magnetic coating material of the present invention, both the dispersing of coagulation of the ferromagnetic powder and the uniform mixing of the ferromagnetic powder and the binder can be performed at a time by cavitation of the ultrasonic wave, thus making it possible to create a state in which the size of secondary coagulation is reduced, and the binder is uniformly absorbed on the surface of the magnetic material. As a result, a magnetic coating material such that the amount of coagulated mass occurring after dispersion processing is not significant, and no magnetic materials are bound together magnetically can be prepared.",
        "In the present invention, it is preferable that the ultrasonic wave is applied within one second after the liquid A and the solution B are mixed together. If the ultrasonic wave is applied within a predetermined amount of time after the liquid A and the solution B are mixed together in this way, the above effect can be achieved more efficiently.",
        "Furthermore, it is preferable that the time until the ultrasonic wave is applied after the liquid A and the solution B are mixed together is within 5 seconds at the maximum. If a larger amount of time passes after the liquid A and the solution B are mixed together, a binder may be adsorbed on the surface of the coagulated ferromagnetic powder, and this situation should be prevented.",
        "Also, in the present invention, it is preferable that the liquid A is subjected to dispersion processing by applying an ultrasonic wave thereto before the liquid A and the solution B are mixed together. If the liquid A is subjected to dispersion processing before the liquid A and the solution B are mixed together in this way, the effect of the present invention can be exhibited more reliably.",
        "Also, in the present invention, it is preferable that the mixing of the liquid A and the solution B by application of the ultrasonic wave is carried out by a flow-type ultrasonic dispersion apparatus. This is because, if the flow-type ultrasonic dispersion apparatus is used in this way, the effect of the present invention can be achieved more reliably.",
        "The present invention is also directed to a method for producing a magnetic recording medium having a nonmagnetic substrate coated with a magnetic coating material containing a ferromagnetic powder and a binder, wherein: the magnetic coating material contains a liquid A constituted by the ferromagnetic powder and a solvent, and a solution B of the binder; and the liquid A is subjected to dispersion processing by applying an ultrasonic wave thereto, and thereafter the liquid A and the solution B are mixed together.",
        "According to the present invention, since the liquid A constituted by a ferromagnetic powder and a solvent is subjected to dispersion processing by applying an ultrasonic wave thereto, and is thereafter mixed with the solution B, coagulated particles of the ferromagnetic powder can be dispersed, and coagulation of the ferromagnetic powder can be prevented, thus making it possible to obtain a liquid in which a binder is uniformly adsorbed. Consequently, a magnetic coating material suitable for a low-noise high-density coating-type magnetic recording medium can be obtained.",
        "According to the method for preparation of a magnetic coating material of the present invention, ultrasonic dispersion processing is carried out with the ferromagnetic powder immersed in the solvent, whereby both the deaeration of the coagulated magnetic material and dispersing of the coagulated magnetic material by cavitation of the ultrasonic wave can be performed at a time, thus making it possible to provide a liquid condition such that the size of secondary coagulation is small, and the surface of the magnetic material is covered with the solvent to improve the wettability.",
        "By mixing the liquid A in this condition with the solution B, the initial contact between the magnetic material and the binder can be uniformalized. As a result, a magnetic coating material in which the amount of coagulated mass is insignificant and magnetic materials are not magnetically bound together can be prepared after dispersion processing.",
        "In the present invention, the ferromagnetic powder can be a needle particle with a major axis length of 10 to 100 nm. Alternatively, the ferromagnetic powder can be a plate particle with a plate diameter of 10 to 50 nm. If the present invention is applied to a ferromagnetic powder having such a form, a magnetic coating material suitable for a low-noise high-density coating-type magnetic recording medium can be obtained.",
        "The nature of this invention, as well as other objects and advantages thereof, will be explained in the following with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate the same or similar parts throughout the figures and wherein:",
        "FIG. 1 is an overall block diagram of a production apparatus for a magnetic coating material for use according to an embodiment of the present invention; and",
        "FIG. 2 is a detailed sectional view of an ultrasonic dispersion apparatus for use in an ultrasonic dispersion system.",
        "A preferred embodiment of a production apparatus 10 for a magnetic coating material for use in a method for producing a magnetic recording medium according to the present invention will be described below based on the accompanying drawings. FIG. 1 is an overall block diagram of the production apparatus 10 for the magnetic coating material, and FIG. 2 is a detailed sectional view of an ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 40 for use in an ultrasonic dispersion system 16.",
        "The production apparatus 10 for the magnetic coating material is constituted by an ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 11 for liquid A, a liquid A supplying system 12, a solution B supplying system 14, the ultrasonic dispersion system 16, a sand mill dispersion system 18 and a magnetic coating solution preparing system 20 in this order from the upstream. Furthermore, the liquid A supplying system 12 and the solution B supplying system 14 are placed side by side, and are arranged so that they join into one just before the ultrasonic dispersion system 16.",
        "The ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 11 for liquid A is an apparatus for dispersing the liquid A constituted by a ferromagnetic powder and a solvent by applying an ultrasonic wave thereto before the liquid A and the solution B are mixed together, and may have any of a batch-type processing form and a flow-type processing form. In other words, the apparatus may have any form as long as the liquid concentration, and the frequency, the irradiation area, the number of circulations and the like in ultrasonic dispersion can be set so that cavities (voids) generated in ultrasonic dispersion processing can be assigned in larger quantity and more uniformly to the ferromagnetic powder immersed in the solvent. The ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 11 for liquid A shown in the drawing has a batch-type processing form.",
        "In the case where the ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 11 for liquid A has a batch-type processing form, a frequency of 15 to 1000 kHz can suitably be employed as an ultrasonic frequency. A high frequency is preferable in terms of the number of generated cavities, while a low frequency is preferable in terms of explosive power of generated cavities. In this respect, by using ultrasonic dispersion processing of different frequencies in combination, the coagulated magnetic material can be dispersed more effectively.",
        "If ultrasonic dispersion processing is carried out with a single frequency, the magnetic material can be dispersed by spending a predetermined amount of time (power consumption) at a frequency of 20 to 40 kHz. If the frequency of 20 kHz is compared with the frequency of 40 kHz, the frequency of 40 kHz is more preferable in that the irradiation area is more likely increased, and a larger number of cavities in the liquid are generated and fractured. For the batch-type ultrasonic dispersion apparatus with the frequency of 40 kHz, a various kinds of commercially available ultrasonic cleaners and the like may be used. The manufacturer and the like are not specifically limited.",
        "When ultrasonic dispersion processing is carried out with the batch-type processing form, it is preferable that the unprocessed liquid A is put in a closed container made of glass, plastic or the like having a diameter smaller than the ultrasonic irradiation area, and the container is placed on an ultrasonic irradiation part. Also, if the unprocessed liquid A is put in a container having a diameter larger than the ultrasonic irradiation area, the liquid is more preferably stirred by a stirrer.",
        "In the case where the ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 11 for liquid A has a flow-type processing form, the frequency of the commercially available ultrasonic dispersion apparatus for flow processing is generally around 20 kHz. Hence, it is preferable that the number of circulations of the liquid A is secured, and thereby the number of generated and fractured cavities in the liquid is secured to promote the dispersing of the coagulated magnetic material. Also, the configuration may be employed such that a plurality of ultrasonic dispersion apparatuses 11 for liquid A are arranged in series. Also, the processing is preferably carried out at a higher flow rate as a measure against settlement of the magnetic material.",
        "For this type of ultrasonic dispersion apparatus, for example, a flow-type ultrasonic dispersion apparatus (trade name: US-1200TCVP) manufactured by Nippon Seiki Co., Ltd. may be used. For the specifications of this apparatus, the frequency is 20 kHz, the MAX amplitude is 30 \u03bcm, the rated output is 1200 W, the space between the irradiation part and a holder is 3 mm, and so on. This ultrasonic dispersion apparatus has an ultrasonic irradiation zone having a circular shape with the diameter of 50 mm, which is preferable in that a larger irradiation area can be provided.",
        "The liquid A supplying system 12 for supplying the liquid A and the solution B supplying system 14 for supplying the solution B are each constituted by a liquid tank, a liquid supplying device and the like. Specifically, the liquid A supplying system 12 is constituted by a liquid tank 21, a stirrer 22 with its leading end placed in the liquid tank 21, and a liquid supplying pipe 23 from the liquid tank 21 and a liquid supplying pump 24. Similarly, the solution B supplying system 14 is constituted by a liquid tank 25, a stirrer 26 with its leading end placed in the liquid tank 25, a liquid supplying pipe 27 from the liquid tank 25 and a liquid supplying pump 28.",
        "For various kinds of constituent members for use in the liquid A supplying system 12 and the solution B supplying system 14 described above, a various kinds of well known members may be used. However, materials causing no contamination and corrosion are preferably employed in consideration of the nature specific to the magnetic coating material for the magnetic recording medium.",
        "In the ultrasonic dispersion system 16, three flow-type ultrasonic dispersion apparatuses 40, 60 and 62 are placed in series. For these three apparatuses, apparatuses of the same specifications are used. These ultrasonic dispersion apparatuses 40, 60 and 62 each have a configuration such that a liquid is supplied from the bottom face of the apparatus, and the liquid is discharged from the side face of the apparatus. By placing three ultrasonic dispersion apparatuses 40, 60 and 62 in series in this way, coagulated particles of the ferromagnetic particle can reliably be dispersed, and the ferromagnetic powder and the binder can be mixed uniformly.",
        "In FIG. 2, a liquid tank 42 of the ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 40 is a cylindrical container, and a straight part (liquid supplying part) 32 of an inverted Y type pipe 30 is connected to the lower end of the cylindrical container. A pipe 38 (liquid discharging part) is connected to the upper part of the side face at one point. The inverted Y type pipe 30 has its leading end bifurcated, and a pipe 34 for the liquid A and a pipe 36 for the solution B joint into the straight part 32.",
        "By providing such the inverted Y type pipe structure, the liquid A and the solution B flow into the liquid tank 42 of the ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 40 to be exposed to an ultrasonic wave within a predetermined amount of time after they are mixed together. Also, by providing this inverted T type pipe structure, the liquid A and the solution B flow into the liquid tank 42 of the ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 40 to be exposed to an ultrasonic wave after a predetermined amount of time passes after they are mixed together. Thus, as long as the same effect can be exhibited, a same function can be obtained even if an inverted T type pipe or lateral T type pipe is used in place of the inverted Y type pipe 30.",
        "The upper end of the liquid tank 42 of the ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 40 is blocked by a flange 50 of an oscillator 44 described later to form a closed container. The cylindrical oscillator 44 is placed in the liquid tank 42 so that an ultrasonic wave can be applied to a liquid passing through the inside of the liquid tank 42. Furthermore, the flange 50 is combined with the oscillator 44 as one united body.",
        "A converter 46 is fixed to the upper end of the oscillator 44, and electricity is supplied to the converter 46 from a power supply 48. Hence, if the ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 40 is activated, ultrasonic vibrations are promoted by the converter 46, and an ultrasonic wave is applied to the inside of the liquid tank 42 by the oscillator 44.",
        "In the ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 40 of this structure, the space between the upper end of the oscillator 44 and the bottom face of the liquid tank 42 is 3 mm. In the ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 40 of this structure, the area where an ultrasonic wave is effectively applied is a nearly conic zone 52 (hatched area in FIG. 2) below the lower end of the oscillator 44, and other zones are much inferior to the zone 52 in the effect of the ultrasonic wave.",
        "As described previously, the ultrasonic dispersion apparatuses 60 and 62 are placed one after another in the downstream of the ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 40. The ultrasonic dispersion apparatuses 60 and 62 each have the same structure as that of the ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 40 as described previously, and therefore the description thereof is not presented. However, they differ from the ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 40 in that the pipes connected to the ultrasonic dispersion apparatuses 60 and 62 on the upstream side are straight pipes.",
        "For the flow-type ultrasonic dispersion apparatuses 40, 60 and 62 described above, for example, Flow-type Ultrasonic Dispersion Apparatus (trade name: US-1200TCVP) manufactured by Nihon Seiki Co., Ltd. can be used. The specifications of this apparatus are not described here because they have been described previously.",
        "Also, the inner diameters on inlet and outlet sides of the ultrasonic dispersion apparatuses 40, 60 and 62 are each 14 mm, and the pipe volume of the straight part of the inverted Y type pipe 30 (extending from the mixing part of the liquid A and the solution B to the inlet of the liquid tank 42) is 3 cm3.",
        "In FIG. 1, the sand mill dispersion system 18 placed in the downstream of the ultrasonic dispersion system 16 is constituted by a liquid tank 70, a stirrer 72 with its leading end placed in the liquid tank 70, a liquid supplying pipe 74 from the liquid tank 70 and a liquid supplying pump 76, a sand mill dispersion apparatus 78, and a return pipe 80 from the sand mill dispersion apparatus 78 to the liquid tank 70.",
        "In this sand mill dispersion system 18, a liquid flowing from the ultrasonic dispersion system 16 is repeatedly circulated by the sand mill dispersion apparatus 78, and a part thereof is supplied to the magnetic coating solution preparing system 20 in the downstream.",
        "This sand mill dispersion system 18 is intended for further dispersing the ferromagnetic powder of the mixture of the liquid A and the solution B, and for various kinds of constituent members for use in the system, various kinds of well known members may be used. However, materials causing no contamination and corrosion are preferably employed in consideration of the nature specific to the magnetic coating material for the magnetic recording medium.",
        "The magnetic coating solution preparing system 20 placed in the downstream of the sand mill dispersion system 18 is constituted by a liquid tank 82, a stirrer 84 with its leading end placed in the liquid tank 82, a liquid supplying pipe 86 from the liquid tank 82, a filter 88, and a pipe 90 from the filter 88. Also, in the liquid tank 82, a liquid C constituted by a lubricant and a solvent, and a liquid D being an additive solution (constituted by carbon black and an abrasive) are newly added.",
        "In the magnetic coating solution preparing system 20, the magnetic coating material is finally prepared, and is passed through the filter 88, whereby contaminants are removed, the magnetic coating material is supplied for a coating step.",
        "The production of the magnetic coating material using the production apparatus 10 for the magnetic coating material will now be described. For the ferromagnetic powder for use in the present invention, various kinds of materials may be used, but if the ferromagnetic powder is a hexagonal ferrite, a material with the plate diameter of preferably 10 to 50 nm, more preferably 10 to 35 nm, and the plate ratio of 2 or greater may be used, and if the ferromagnetic powder is a ferromagnetic metal powder, a material with the major axis length of preferably 10 to 100 nm, more preferably 10 to 60 nm, and the axis ratio of 2 or greater may be used. For the particle size of this ferromagnetic powder, a material with the average primary particle volume of 10,000 nm3 or smaller may suitably be used.",
        "In the liquid A, the solvent in which the ferromagnetic powder is immersed is preferably a solution containing a cyclohexanone. The content of cyclohexanone is preferably 30 to 100% by weight of the total amount of solvent. For the solution other than cyclohexanone, methyl ethyl ketone, toluene, butyl acetate or the like is preferably used.",
        "The liquid concentration of the liquid A is preferably 5 to 80% by weight, more preferably 10 to 50% by weight, further preferably 25 to 50% by weight. The upper limit of the liquid concentration is defined by permeability, and the lower limit of the liquid concentration is defined by the effect of ultrasonic dispersion.",
        "The liquid A subjected to ultrasonic dispersion processing by the ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 11 for liquid A is put in the liquid tank 21 of the liquid A supplying system 12, and is stirred by the stirrer 22.",
        "In the solution B supplying system 14 shown in FIG. 1, the concentration of solution B of binder is preferably set so that it has a liquid viscosity of 10 Pa\u00b7s (100P) or lower, more preferably 1 Pa\u00b7s (10P) or lower, most preferably 0.1 Pa\u00b7s (1P) or lower by vismetron.",
        "The ratio of the binder of the magnetic material in the solution B when the liquid A is mixed with the solution B is preferably 0.5 to 30 parts by weight, more preferably 2 to 15 parts by weight of binder relative to 100 parts by weight of magnetic material. Also, in consideration of assurance of film strength, assurance of dispersion and so on, it is preferable that a necessary binder is added in midstream depending on the dispersion level in the sense that the dispersion efficiency can be improved.",
        "The speed at which the magnetic coating material is processed by the production apparatus 10 for the magnetic coating material varies depending on the apparatus size, the concentrations of liquids, the compositions of liquids and the like, but for example, the liquid A and the solution B can be mixed at a flow rate of 500 g/minute, respectively, in the inverted Y type pipe 30 corresponding to the inlet of the ultrasonic dispersion system 16 of the production apparatus 10 for the magnetic coating material. In this case, as long as the inverted Y type pipe 30 has a structure described previously (the pipe volume of the straight part is 3 cm3), the ultrasonic wave is applied when the time of 0.18 to 0.32 seconds passes (when the specific gravity of the mixture reaches 1 to 1.8 g/cm3) after the liquid A and the solution B are mixed together.",
        "Various kinds of well known methods of production may be employed for production of the magnetic recording medium by the magnetic coating material obtained by the production apparatus 10 for the magnetic coating material.

        "The magnetic layer of the produced magnetic recording medium preferably has a thickness of 0.02 to 3 \u03bcm, more preferably 0.02 to 0.2 \u03bcm in dry state. Also, the layer composition is preferably such that a nonmagnetic layer having mainly a nonmagnetic powder and a binder is provided between the magnetic layer and a nonmagnetic substrate. Particularly, the composition in which the magnetic layer is a thin layer has not only an advantage that a reduction in C/N in the shortwave range is prevented to improve the medium performance but also an advantage that productivity can be improved because the level of coating seams associated with the dispersing of the coagulated magnetic material can be reduced.",

        "Also, the flow-type ultrasonic dispersion apparatuses 40, 60 and 62 are employed in the ultrasonic dispersion system 16, and the sand mill dispersion apparatus 78 is employed in the sand mill dispersion system 18, but their processing order may be reversed, or the ultrasonic dispersion system may be additionally introduced after the sand mill dispersion system 18. Also, various kinds of other types of mixing devises may be employed in place of the ultrasonic dispersion apparatus 40 mixing together the liquid A and the solution B. Other types of mixing devises include such as a dissolver-type stirrer, a homomixer stirrer and a thin-layer revolving type fast stirrer (e.g. manufactured by Tokushukikako Industry Co., Ltd.).",
        "Also, three flow-type ultrasonic dispersion apparatuses 40, 60 and 62 are placed in series in this illustrative embodiment, but only one ultrasonic dispersion apparatus having greater output may be placed, or multiple ultrasonic dispersion apparatuses each having small output may be placed.",

Numbers of masses equivalent to 8 visual fields in the 500 times visual field were summed to determine the number of masses. The area equivalent to 8 visual fields in the 500 times visual field corresponds to 0.1768 mm2.",

Consequently, a magnetic coating material suitable for a low-noise high-density coating-type magnetic recording medium can be obtained.",
        "Also, according to the present invention, since the liquid A constituted by a ferromagnetic powder and a solvent is subjected to dispersion processing by applying an ultrasonic wave thereto, and is thereafter mixed with the solution B, coagulated particles of the ferromagnetic powder can be dispersed, and the coagulation of the ferromagnetic powder can be prevented, thereby making it possible to obtain a solution of ferromagnetic powder in which a binder is uniformly adsorbed. Consequently, a magnetic coating material suitable for a low-nose high density coating-type magnetic recording medium can be obtained.",
        "It should be understood, however, that there is no intention to limit the invention to the specific forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the invention is to cover all modifications, alternate constructions and equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."
