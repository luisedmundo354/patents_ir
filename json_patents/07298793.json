        "OFDM is a multi-channel modulation system employing Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) of orthogonal sub-carriers, each modulating a low bit-rate digital stream. The simplest way to describe an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is as a set of closely spaced frequency-division multiplexed carriers. While this is a good starting point for those unfamiliar with the technology, it falls short as a model for analyzing the effects of signal impairment.",
        "The reason it falls short is that the carriers are more than closely spaced; they are heavily overlapped. In a perfect OFDM signal, the orthogonality property prevents interference between overlapping carriers. This is different from the FDM systems. In FDM systems, any overlap in the spectrums of adjacent signals will result in interference. In OFDM systems, the carriers will interfere with each other only if there is a loss of orthogonality. So long as orthogonality can be maintained, the carriers can be heavily overlapped, allowing increased spectral efficiency.",
        "Table 1 lists a variety of common analog signal impairments and their effects on both OFDM signals and the more familiar single-carrier modulations such as quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) or 64-QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation). Most of these impairments can occur in either the transmitter or the receiver.",

        "For cost reasons, analog in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) modulators and demodulators are often used in transceivers especially for wide bandwidth signals. Being analog, these I/Q modulators and demodulators usually have imperfections that result in an imperfect match between the two baseband analog signals, I and Q, which represent the complex carrier. For example, gain mismatch might cause the I signal to be slightly different from the Q. In a single-carrier modulation system, this results in a visible distortion in the constellation\u2014the square constellation of a 64-QAM signal would become rectangular.",
        "To better understand how gain imbalance will affect an OFDM signal, look at the equations describing each individual sub-carrier. In the following analysis, it's important to keep in mind that, while an individual sub-carrier is analyzed, the I/Q gain imbalance error is on the signal that is the composite of all sub-carriers.",
        "In the equation (1), Ck,m is a complex number representing the location of the symbol within the constellation for the kth sub-carrier at the mth symbol time. For example, if sub-carrier k is binary-phase-shift-keying (BPSK) modulated, then Ck,m might take on values of \u00b11+j0. The complex exponential portion of equation (1) represents the kth sub-carrier, which is amplitude- and phase-modulated by the symbol Ck,m. Therefore:\n\nCk,m(ej2\u03c0k\u0394ft)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere \u0394f is the frequency space between the sub-carrier.

        "In words, the equation (5) shows that a gain imbalance produces two error terms. The first error term is at the frequency of the kth sub-carrier. The second error term is at the frequency of the \u2212kth sub-carrier. The phase and magnitude of the error terms are proportional to the symbol being transmitted on the kth sub-carrier. Another way of saying this is that I/Q gain imbalance will result in each sub-carrier being interfered with by its frequency mirror-image sub-carrier. Persons skilled in the art will instantly recognize this as imperfect sideband cancellation.",
        "The equation (5) has several implications. First, it is generally true that for sub-carriers used to carry data (as opposed to pilots), the symbol being transmitted at any given time on the kth sub-carrier is uncorrelated to the symbol on the \u2212kth sub-carrier.",
        "For a given sub-carrier, the lack of correlation from the mirror-image sub-carrier implies a certain randomness to the error. This results in a spreading of the sub-carrier's constellation states in a noise-like fashion. This is especially true for higher-order modulations such as 64-QAM. For lower-order modulations, such as BPSK, the error term from the mirror-image carrier has fewer states.",
        "This can result in constellations where the BPSK pilot carriers of an 802.11a signal exhibit spreading that does not appear noise-like. Also, as the BPSK pilots do not have an imaginary component; the error terms associated with the pilot sub-carriers are real\u2014so the spreading is only along the real (I) axis. Note that the phase relationships between the pilot carriers in an 802.11a system are highly correlated, so the errors introduced by quadrature errors are not random.",
        "Quadrature skew produces error terms similar to those produced by gain imbalance. Quadrature skew occurs when the two oscillators used in an I/Q modulator or demodulator do not differ by exactly 90\u00b0. For a small angular error, it can be shown that the resulting error is orthogonal to the data. This is indicated by the j in front of the error terms in the equation (6). As with gain imbalance, the error generates energy at the kth and \u2212kth sub-carriers. Again, the 802.11a BPSK pilots do not have an imaginary component, so the error term, which is now orthogonal, causes spreading along the Q axis. For the QPSK carriers in this example, the error is also orthogonal. However, unlike BPSK, a QPSK constellation doesn't look any different when rotated by 90\u00b0. (See the equation (6)):",

        "In both 802.11a and Hiperlan2, a channel estimation sequence is transmitted at the beginning of a burst. This special sequence is used to train the receiver's equalizer. The intended function of the equalizer is to compensate the received signal for multi-path distortion a linear impairment in the signal that is the result of multiple signal paths between the transmitter and the receiver. As the ideal channel estimation sequence is known by the receiver, the receiver can observe the effects of the channel on the transmitted signal and compute a set of equalizer coefficients.",
        "In the transmitter, the channel estimation sequence is created by BPSK modulating all 52 carriers for a portion of the preamble. Not coincidentally, the equalizer consists of 52 complex coefficients\u2014one for each sub-carrier. It should come as no surprise that each sub-carrier in the channel estimation sequence has the greatest influence on the equalizer coefficient computed for that same sub-carrier.",
        "The channel estimation sequence, and the receiver algorithms that compute the equalizer coefficients, are not immune from signal impairments. Consider, for example, the effect of I/Q gain imbalance on sub-carriers +26 and \u221226 of the channel estimation sequence. Recall from equation (5) that each sub-carrier has two error terms: one at the same frequency as the sub-carrier, and one at the mirror image frequency. The I/Q gain imbalance will cause mutual interference between sub-carriers +26 and \u221226.",
        "From the IEEE 802.11a standard, the sub-carrier modulation for the channel estimation sequence is defined to be C\u221226=1+j0 and C+26=1+j0. Using these values in equation (5), one can easily determine that the two sub-carriers, when combined with the resulting error terms, will suffer an increase in amplitude. The equalizer algorithm will be unable to differentiate the error from the actual channel response, and will interpret this as a channel with too much gain at these two sub-carrier frequencies. The equalizer will incorrectly attempt to compensate by reducing the gain on these sub-carriers for subsequent data symbols.",
        "The result will be different for other sub-carrier pairs, depending on the BPSK channel estimation symbols assigned to each.",
        "With QPSK sub-carriers, the equalizer error caused by gain imbalance, or quadrature skew, results in seven groupings in each corner. Each QPSK sub-carrier suffers from QPSK interference from its mirror image. This results in a spreading to four constellation points in each corner. Each QPSK sub-carrier also suffers from a bi-level gain error introduced by the equalizer. This would produce eight groupings, except that the gain error is such that corners of the groupings overlap at the ideal corner state. Only seven groupings are visible.",
        "I/Q Channel Mismatch",
        "When the frequency response of the baseband I and Q channel signal paths are different, an I/Q channel mismatch exists. I/Q channel mismatch can be modeled as a sub-carrier-dependent gain imbalance and quadrature skew. I/Q gain imbalance and quadrature skew, as described above, are simply a degenerate form of I/Q channel mismatch in which the mismatch is constant over all sub-carriers. Think of channel mismatch as gain imbalance and quadrature skew as a function of a sub-carrier. It is still generally true that channel mismatch causes interaction between the kth and \u2212kth sub-carriers, but that the magnitude of the impairment could differ between the kth and the (k+n)th carriers.",

The estimator is entirely analog and includes two mixers 120, 121 to which are applied two carrier signals P1 and P2 derived from a carrier signal P obtained from a local oscillator and from a 90\u00b0 phase-shifter 122. A modulating signal X, Y is applied to each of the mixers 120, 121. The output signals of the mixers 120, 121 are applied to a combiner 123 to constitute a modulated signal S. The modulated signal S is either an intermediate frequency signal or a microwave frequency signal. The estimator 124 of the invention includes means 125 for detecting the instantaneous power Pd of the modulated signal S, means 126, 127 for multiplying the detected instantaneous power Pd by each of the modulating signals X, Y, means 128A, 129A for rectifying the signals produced, which rectifier means can be diodes, for example, and means 130, 131 for integrating the rectified signals, the integrator means being followed by subtractors 160, 161 supplying respective signals E1 and E2 proportional to the amplitude of the modulator imbalance. The subtractors 160 and 161 receive respective analog reference signals REF1 and REF2, which are usually identical (REF1=REF2), the output signals of the integrator means 130, 131 being subtracted from REF1 and REF2, respectively. For example, REF1 and REF2 are equal to twice the mean amplitude of the modulated signal S. The subtractors 160 and 161 generally need to be used only for the purposes of correcting imbalance. The signals E1 and E2 are respectively applied to the multipliers 150 and 151 on the input side of the mixers 121 and 120, respectively, to correct the offsets introduced by these mixers.",

        "FIG. 2 shows a setup of TX I/Q channel mismatch and carrier local leakage calibration for 802.11 g of a transmitter according to the embodiment of the present invention. First, a discrete-time signal x[n]=x(nTs)=ej2\u03c0fTnTs is generated by a signal generator 30, where x(t)=ej2\u03c0fTt represents a single tone signal, fT is a real number representing the frequency in Hz of the signal x(t) and TS is the sampling period. Next, the signal x[n] is passed to an I/Q correction module 31 including local leakage correction module 32 and gain/phase correction module 33, then the corrected signal xc[n] output by the I/Q correction module 31 is fed to a pair of D/A converters, the first D/A converter 34A and the second D/A converter 34B, which convert the corrected signal xc[n] to an analog signal xc(t). To speak more specifically, the first D/A converter 34A converts the real part of the corrected signal xc[n] to the real part of the analog signal xc(t) and the second D/A converter 34B converts the imaginary part of the corrected signal xc[n] to the imaginary part of the analog signal xc(t). The analog signal xc(t) is applied to an I/Q modulator, which increase the central frequency of the analog signal xc(t) by fc Hz and outputting a modulated signal xm(t), wherein fc is a preset real number. The modulated signal xm(t) is then monitored by a spectrum analyzer 36, or other equipment that can monitor the signal spectrum, to obtain the intensities of the frequency components of the modulated signal xm(t) at fc+fT, fc\u2212fT, and fc Hz, denoted by W(fT), W(\u2212fT), and L, respectively. The W(fT), W(\u2212fT), and L are actually values indicative of the power of the equivalent baseband signal of xm(t) at fT, \u2212fT, and 0 Hz, respectively. From the point of view of the I/Q correction, the term W(fT) represents a desired component, which will contain all the energy of the analog corrected signal xc(t) if the I/Q mismatch is ideally compensated. And the term W(\u2212fT) represents the image component, which is the additional interfering component at the image frequency due to the I/Q imbalance. And the term L represents the local leakage component, which is the baseband-equivalent DC component incurred by the carrier leakage. According to the obtained data W(fT), W(\u2212fT), and L, the personal computer (PC) 38 computes the parameters required by the I/Q correction module 31 to minimize the impacts due to the I/Q channel mismatch and local leakage.",

        "In addition, the step S14 is performed by the personal computer 38 shown in FIG. 2 of the present invention.",
        "The previously described method can be applied to a transceiver module, e.g., an IEEE 802.11 compliant wireless LAN transceiver module, involving I/Q demodulation. Wireless LANs based on the IEEE 802.11 standard have achieved wide customer acceptance in the enterprise environment. They are expected to continue to expand in popularity and become ubiquitous communication systems even in private and public places.",
        "Thus, after the calibration procedure, the I/Q correction module compensates the I/Q channel mismatch in the signal from the baseband transmitter by the finally determined coefficients Ap, Bp and \u03b3p. The previously described calibration procedure may be implemented upon production stage of the transceiver.",
        "In conclusion, the present invention provides a new method and apparatus for transmitter I/Q mismatch calibration, especially suitable for an IEEE 802.11g compliant WLAN transceiver module. The compensation of the I/Q mismatch is achieved by a signal pre-distortion prior to the I/Q modulation. The coefficients of the pre-distortion function are determined by a calibration procedure. After performing the procedure disclosed by the embodiment of the present invention, the coefficients are accurate enough for the transmitted signal to be free from the I/Q mismatch.",
        "In addition, the present invention can be applied to any kind of transmitter having an I/Q modulator, and the OFDM transmitter is just one example, thus it is not limited to the scope of the present invention.",
        "The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of this invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description.
