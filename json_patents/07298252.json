Wireless interface 210 includes a wireless transmitter 209 and a wireless receiver 211.",
        "The operation of the media player/recorder is as follows. Operation of the media player/recorder is controlled by the user through keypad 208. Status of the media player/recorder is provided to the user by display 212.",
        "Media data, which was previously digitized, may be obtained (downloaded) from a personal computer, network appliance, local area network, Internet 50 and the like, including wireless networks with infrastructure, such as a designated access point, peer-to-peer wireless networks, and the like. Such external devices communicate with the media player/recorder via wired interface 206 and wireless interface 210, which are controlled by processor 300. Wired interface 206 may be implemented, for example, as a parallel interface, serial interface, USB, Ethernet connection, IEEE 1394 (a.k.a. Firewire), and the like. Wireless interface 210 may be implemented, for example, as an infrared interface, IEEE 802.15, IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth\u2122 and the like. Again the present invention is independent of the interface selected. Media data is then stored on the storage device such as, disk drive 230 in accordance with processor 300. Disk drive 230 is preferably a miniature drive with a capacity of 1 Gbyte of data storage, which is particularly suitable for a portable device. Of course, any other appropriate sized disk drive may be employed.",

The quantity of solid state memory contemplate is about 2 Mbytes, which is sufficient to store about 2 minutes of MP3 data. Of course, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, when dealing with video data, more solid state memory may be required. The amount of solid state memory supplied is selected to minimize energy consumption.",
        "After the selected data is stored in memory 202, disk drive 230 is then powered down. In this manner, during playback disk drive 230 is powered up only during the transfer of the selected media data from disk drive 230 to memory 202, which results in lower energy consumption. A more detailed description of the powering down of disk drive 230 is provided herein below. The media data is retrieved from memory 202.

A media playback/recorder apparatus having a processor implemented as a single integrated circuit can be fabricated at lower cost and have lower energy consumption. Alternatively, processor 300 may be implemented by discrete components. Processor 300 comprises a read channel 341, storage controller or hard disk controller 342, digital signal processor/microprocessor unit (DSP/MPU) 343, random access memory (RAM) 344, a non volatile memory such as read only memory (ROM) 345, digital to analog converter (DAC) 346 and analog to digital converter (ADC) 347.

RAM 345 is provided as a working memory for DSP/MPU 343. For each of the various compression formats discussed above, the decompression and compression algorithms for Codec 348 are stored on disk drive 230. Storing the decompression and compression algorithms on disk drive 230 minimizes the size of ROM 345 and its energy consumption. Additionally, this feature allows future compression and decompressions formats to be easily implemented for the media player/recorder.",
        "In the implementation of FIG. 3, wireless interface 210 is implemented separately from processor 300, and includes an antenna 356, a wireless unit 354, a baseband processor 352, and a media access controller (MAC) 350. Antenna 356 is a conventional antenna for receiving and transmitting wireless signals. Wireless unit 354 converts wireless signals received by antenna 356 to analog baseband signals, and converts analog baseband signals received from baseband processor 352 to wireless signals for transmission by antenna 356. Baseband processor 352 converts analog baseband signals received from wireless unit 354 to a digital bitstream, and converts a digital bitstream received from MAC 350 to analog baseband signals, both according to well-known methods. MAC 350 frames the digital bitstream produced by baseband processor 352, and filters the frames to select the frames addressed to processor 300, both according to well-known methods. MAC 350 also converts frames received from processor 300 to a digital bitstream for baseband processor 352, also according to well-known methods. In some implementations, MAC 350 includes an embedded microprocessor.",
        "Prior to discussing the operation of processor 300, reference is made to FIG. 6. FIG. 6 shows an exemplary data format of a magnetic media used in disk drive 230, comprising a series of concentric data tracks 13 wherein each data track 13 comprises a plurality of sectors 15 with embedded servo wedges 17. Servo controller 349 processes the servo data in servo wedges 17 and, in response thereto, positions the read/write head over a desired track. Additionally, servo controller 349 processes servo bursts within servo wedges 17 to keep a disk head of disk drive 230 aligned over a centerline of the desired track while writing and reading data. Servo wedges 17 may be detected by the discrete time sequence detector implemented in DSP/MPU 343. It is important to note that DSP/MPU 343 is utilized only during the time period for detecting servo wedges 17; during other periods DSP/MPU 343 is available to perform other functions as described below, such as signal processing for media data playback and recording. By using only one DSP rather than two, the cost of fabrication and the amount of energy consumption can be reduced.",
        "As described above, the powering up of the device is done in a sequential manner so as to minimize energy consumption of the device. More specifically, the mechanical or motor portions of the storage device are energized first. After the motor reaches operating speed, VCM 234 is energized, followed by the energization of read channel 341 and HDC 342.",
        "The operation of processor 300 is as follows. DSP/MPU 343 controls the entire operation of the media player/recorder. DSP/MPU 343 is coupled to hard disk controller 342. When writing data to disk drive 230, hard disk controller 342 receives a write instruction and write data from DSP/MPU 343. The write data is temporarily stored in a cache memory (not shown) which is used as a buffer memory. Based on a clock from a clock generator (not shown), DSP/MPU 343 controls voice coil motor (VCM) and spindle motor 234 via servo unit 349. As a result, the magnetic head is moved to a desired track position on the magnetic disk by the head arm, and the magnetic disk is rotated at a rated rotational speed by the spindle, which is driven by spindle motor 234. The data is read from the cache memory and supplied to read channel 341 via hard disk controller 342. Read channel 341 encodes the write data under the control of DSP/MPU 343, and supplies the encoded write data to preamplifier 232. The magnetic head writes the encoded write data on the magnetic disk in accordance with a signal from preamplifier 232.",
        "When reading data from the magnetic disk, hard disk controller 342 receives a read instruction from DSP/MPU 343. Based on a clock signal, DSP/MPU 343 controls voice coil motor and spindle motor 234 via servo unit 349. Hence, the magnetic head is moved to a desired track position on the magnetic disk by the head arm, and the magnetic disk is rotated by spindle motor 234.",
        "The data read from the magnetic disk by the magnetic head is supplied to read channel 341 via preamplifier 232. Read channel 341 decodes the read data under the control of DSP/MPU 343, and generates read data. The read data are supplied from read channel 341 to hard disk controller 342 under the control of DSP/MPU 343, and are temporarily stored in the cache memory. The read data read from the cache memory are supplied to DSP/MPU 343 from hard disk controller 342.",

Status of the media player/recorder is provided to the user by display 212 in accordance with DSP/MPU 343. When either uploading or downloading data, the media player/recorder is in communication with personal computer, network appliance, local area network, Internet 50. Otherwise the media player/recorder can be operated independently. The user selects the file to be downloaded from personal computer, network appliance, local area network, Internet 50 by way of keypad 208. Alternatively the user can select the file to be downloaded from the personal computer. DSP/MPU 343 controls the flow of data through interfaces 206 and/or 210 and stores the data onto hard disk 230 in accordance with the method described above. When uploading data to personal computer, network appliance, local area network, Internet 50 the process is reversed.",
        "To record data directly input into media player/recorder from an external analog source, the external device is placed in communication with input 214. Input 214 takes the input signal from the external device and sets the analog signal to an appropriate level. The analog signal is then converted to a digital signal by ADC 347 of processor 300. Codec 348 of DSP/MPU 343 compresses the digitized data using a default compression format or one selected by the user by way of keypad 208. The default or selected compression program is transferred from hard disk 230 to RAM 344 and provided to Codec 348 for encoding. The compressed digital data is similarly stored on disk drive 230 under the control of DSP/MPU 343.",
        "When the user chooses a selection of media data to be played back with keypad 208, DSP/MPU 343 powers up disk drive 230 and retrieves the selected data as described above. The retrieved data is then written to memory 202. After the selected data is stored in memory 202, disk drive 230 is then powered down by DSP/MPU 343. In this manner, during playback disk drive 230 is powered up only during the transfer of the selected media data from disk drive 230 to memory 202, which results in lower energy consumption. A single song stored in MP3 format may take approximately one second to retrieve from disk drive 230. The media data is retrieved from memory 202 by DSP/MPU 343 and the compression format is then determined.",
        "If the decompression program has already been transferred to RAM 344, the program is provided to Codec 348. Otherwise the decompression algorithm is retrieved from hard disk 230 and transferred to RAM 344. The data is then decompressed by Codec 348 and converted to an analog signal by DAC 346.

        "Referring now to FIGS. 3, 7 and 9, when the user turns on the media player and selects a file to be played (step 912), the various components of media player are powered up in a sequential manner so as to minimize energy consumption of the device. More specifically, the mechanical or motor portions of the storage device or disk drive 230 are energized first (step 914). After the motor reaches its operating speed (step 916), VCM 234, preamp 232, read channel 341 and HDC 342 are energized, since these components are only functional after disk drive 230 becomes operational. Energy would be unnecessarily expended if preamp 232, read channel 341 and HDC 342 were energized before disk drive 230 becomes operational. Therefore, VCM 234, preamp 232, read channel 341 and HDC 342 are energized only after disk drive 230 becomes operational (step 918). Preamp 232, read channel 341 and HDC 342 can be referred to as a storage circuit and include circuits to transform data stored on a storage device to a digital signal.",
        "FIG. 7 is a schematic representation of memory 202. User data is first stored from location 724 to location 702 in a sequential manner in memory 202. In one embodiment, DSP/MPU 343 uses a pointer system in connection with memory 202 to determine when the amount of data stored the amount data stored reaches an upper threshold value (step 922). When the amount of data stored in memory 202 reaches the upper threshold value, HDC 342, read channel 341, preamp 232, disk drive 230 and VCM 234 are powered down or deenergized (step 924). Of course, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, while data is being to memory 202, data may also be read contemporaneously therefrom by DSP/MPU 343 for decompression and playback. Data is then read out from memory 202 starting at location 702 towards location 724 by DSP/MPU 343 (step 926). When the data file has been completely read from memory (step 928), the user can select another file. The data is continually read from memory 202, until the amount of data remaining is below a low threshold value (step 930). When the data remaining in memory 202 is below the threshold value, disk drive 230, VCM 234, preamp 232, read channel 341 and HDC 342 are sequentially energized as noted above, and data is transferred from the storage device to memory 202.",
        "FIG. 10 is an alternate embodiment to FIG. 9. Instead of utilizing a pointer system, the amount of data transferred to memory 202 is counted (step 1020) by a counter incorporated in DSP/MPU 343. The sequential energization of the disk drive 230, VCM 234, preamp 232, read channel 341 and HDC 342 is similar to that of the embodiment of FIG. 9 (steps 1012, 1014, 1016 and 1018). When amount of data transfer to memory 202 is greater than or equal to an upper limit U (step 1022), HDC 342, read channel 341, preamp 232, disk drive 230 and VCM 234 are powered down deenergized (step 1024). As data is read from memory, the counter decrements the count, and when the count is less than or equal to a lower limit 1 (step 1030), disk drive 230, VCM 234, preamp 232, read channel 341 and HDC 342 are sequentially energized as noted above, and data is transferred from the storage device to memory 202.",
        "FIG. 11 is another alternate embodiment to FIG. 9. The embodiment in FIG. 9 utilizes a timer incorporated in DSP/MPU 343 to approximate the amount of data transferred to memory 202 in accordance with the data transfer rate of disk drive 230. The sequential energization of disk drive 230, VCM 234, preamp 232, read channel 341 and HDC 342 is similar to that of the embodiment of FIG. 9 (steps 1112, 1114, 1116 and 1118). The timer is started (step 1119) as data is transferred form disk drive 230 to memory 202. When the timer times out, HDC 342, read channel 341, preamp 232, disk drive 230 and VCM 234 are powered down or deenergized (step 1124). As data is read from memory, the timer is started (1125), and when the timer times out (step 1130), disk drive 230, VCM 234, preamp 232, read channel 341 and HDC 342 are sequentially energized as noted above, and data is transferred from the storage device to memory 202.",
        "In the simplest implementation, media data representing one selection (such as a single song) is transferred from disk drive 230 to memory 202 for playback. FIG. 8 is a schematic representation of memory 202, and FIG. 12 is a flow chart illustrating an alternate implementation. As shown therein, instead of retrieving just one selection, first portions of multiple selections are transferred from disk drive 230 to memory 202. These multiple selections may include the user's favorite selections, random selections from an external source, or the like (step 1204). When the user starts playing back the selection, a timer is started (step 1208) and the first selection is played back (step 1210). If a user instruction is received (step 1212) to continue playing that selection is received within a predetermined time (step 1214), the remaining portion of the selection is transferred from disk drive 230 to memory 202 (step 1216) for continued play back (step 1218). If the timer times out (step 1214), the first portion of the next selection (step 1206) is played back and the process is repeated for each remaining first portion. Alternatively, instead of using a timer, a memory threshold, as shown in FIG. 8, may be utilized permit playback of the entire current selection if the user instruction is received before the memory being read out goes below the current selection threshold. Otherwise the first portion of the next selection is played back. Of course, the play back of portions of selections 1 through N may be in any order, such as sequential, random and predetermined. If the play back is in sequential order new selections may be transferred from disk drive 230 to memory 202 to replace previously played back selections.",

In some implementations, MAC 350 includes an embedded DSP/MPU. These implementations operate in a manner similar to that described for the implementations of FIG. 15.",
        "The implementations using non-volatile memory instead of a hard drive are especially useful for receiving streaming media from broadcasts such as internet radio stations and other media player recorders. Some implementations feature a \u201cbroadcast\u201d mode where the media player/recorder plays a media selection and wirelessly transmits the media selection, either compressed or uncompressed, or in analog form, such that other media player/recorders can receive the broadcast media and play it at the same time as the broadcasting player/recorder.",
        "The implementations with no hard drive or non-volatile memory are especially useful in a \u201clocal radio\u201d mode where the media to be played is stored on a personal computer, server, or the like that is separate from the media player/recorder.",
        "FIG. 17 illustrates the local radio mode. In this mode, the media is wirelessly streamed to the media player/recorder 1704, which decompresses and plays the media without storing the media. Because the media player/recorder never stores a copy of the media, it is ideal for playing media for which only a single copy is licensed. The single copy is stored on a personal computer (PC) 1702, and is streamed to media player/recorder 1704 for playback. Because only a single copy of the media is stored, the single-copy license is satisfied.",
        "FIG. 18 shows an implementation where a media player/recorder 1804 is implemented within a digital camera 1802. In recording mode, an image sensor 1806 within camera 1802 captures one or more images, and passes a signal representing the image to media player/recorder 1804. If the signal is analog, a analog-to-digital converter within media player/recorder 1804 converts the analog signal to a digital signal. A digital signal processor within media player/recorder 1804 then encodes the digital signal. The encoding can include image compression, image manipulation, and the like. A storage controller within media player/recorder 1804 stores the encoded image data on a storage device. In some implementations, digital camera 1802 is a digital motion picture camera and the encoded image data represents a motion picture.",
        "In playback mode, the storage controller retrieves the encoded image data from the storage device. The digital signal processor decodes the retrieved encoded image data. Media player/recorder 1804 sends a signal representing the decoded image data to a display 1808, which displays the image(s) captured by image sensor 1806.A The media player/recorder described herein can be implemented as a portable unit, as a permanently mounted unit within a vehicle such as an automobile, and the like. FIG. 19 shows automobiles 1902A and 1902B equipped with such a media player/recorder. In this implementation, the antenna of the automobile can serve as the antenna of the media player/recorder. The media player/recorders in the automobiles 1902 can communicate with each other, without user intervention, while traveling near each other, while stopped at intersections, and in other similar scenarios, to share media data, items of interest, and the like. The media player/recorders in the automobiles 1902 can also communicate with portable media player/recorders 1904 in a similar fashion. The vehicular and portable media player/recorders can communicate with a stationary base station 1906 to share media over a network such as the Internet. For example, a homeowner can equip his garage with such a base station 1906 so the media player/recorder in his automobile can share media and items of interest while parked in the garage during the night. Similarly, a user of a portable player/recorder 1904 can equip his home with a base station 1906 so the media player/recorder 1904 can share media and items of interest while not otherwise in use, for example while the user sleeps.",
