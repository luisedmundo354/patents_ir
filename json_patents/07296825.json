        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "This invention relates to vehicle occupant safety restraint systems and devices. More specifically, this invention relates to seat belt restraint devices and in particular to buckle switches that sense whether a buckle is latched or unlatched and which provide appropriate signals for the various buckle latch states: buckled, unbuckled, short circuited, and open (damaged).",

        "The accompanying drawings incorporated in and forming a part of the specification, illustrate a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Some, although not all, alternative embodiments are described in the following description. In the drawings:",
        "FIG. 1 depicts the preferred switch body diagram.",
        "FIG. 2 depicts the preferred circuit diagram and output circuit.",
        "FIG. 3 depicts a preferred seat belt buckle having the switch of this invention.",
        "FIGS. 4(a)-4(e) depict the detailed mechanical drawings of the preferred switch of this invention.",
        "Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiment of the invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings.",
        "FIG. 1 shows a diagram of the switch body of the preferred embodiment of this invention. The switch body 101 holds a first wire terminal 206b and a second wire terminal 206a. A first conductive path 103a electrically connects the first wire terminal 206b with a switching device 104. The switching device 104, in turn, is connected by a second conductive path 103b with a resistive circuit 105. The resistive circuit 105 is then connected to the second wire terminal 206a via a third conductive path 103c. The switching device 104 is preferably comprised of a flexible metal member and a shorting pad, between which an air gap is maintained when the buckle is in an unbuckled state. When the buckle is buckled, the flexible metal member 104 is deflected bringing the flexible metal member and the shorting pad in direct electrical contact and thereby modifying the resistance of the circuit as measured at the first and second wire terminals 206b,a.",
        "FIG. 2 shows the preferred circuit diagram and output circuit of this invention. The preferred resistive circuit 105 is typically electrically connected to a control module 201, which in an adaptive restraints application, monitors the switch resistance so that, in the event of a vehicle crash, the control module 201 can deploy other safety devices based on whether or not the occupant is belted, as determined from the resistance of the switch. The control module 201 may also use the measured resistance values from the switch to light courtesy lights in the vehicle to encourage the use of the seat belt. Electrically, typically and preferably, the control module connects to the resistive circuit 105 by the wire terminals schematically depicted in FIG. 2 as 206a,b. The dome switch 104 is shown schematically as a switch. The present preferred resistive circuit 105 itself comprises two resistors R1205 and R2204, which are electrically in parallel when the dome switch 104 is closed and which have approximately equal resistance values. This preferred resistive circuit 105 provides four resistance determinative states. (1) A buckled state. When the latch plate/tongue is inserted in the buckle, the dome switch 104 is closed, thereby establishing an equivalent resistance REQ due to the parallel combination of R1205 and R2204. In the buckled state REQ is non-zero, but relatively low. (2) The unbuckled state. When no latch plate/tongue is inserted in the switch, the dome switch 104 remains open, thereby establishing an equivalent resistance REQ equal to R1205. Therefore, in the unbuckled state REQ is non-zero and relatively high. (3) Open Loop state. In the event that the resistive circuit or the switch is broken, the REQ is expected to be equal to an open circuit, or approximately infinite. (4) Shorted switch condition. On occasion the switch may be shorted out, either intentionally by the user or unintentionally by accident. A shorted switch may defeat or impair the operation of the control module 201. In a shorted switch condition the REQ is equal to approximately zero. In sum, each condition, buckled, unbuckled, open and shorted, is detectable by the control module 201 by measuring the relative resistance of the resistive circuit 105.",
        "FIG. 3 shows a seat belt buckle 300 having the preferred switch of this invention. The buckle latch plate/tongue 305 being inserted into the buckle 300 causes the latch 306 to impose force on the flexible metal member 104, thereby closing the circuit and indicating the buckling to the control module 201. Two inserts 301, 302 are shown in FIG. 3. Insert 301 shows a detail perspective of the switch membrane 303 with the buckle tongue 305 not inserted and therefore, with the latch 306 out of contact with the dome switch 104. Insert view 302 shows the latch 306 in contact with the dome switch 104 placing the flexible metal member in a deflected closed condition 304.",
        "FIGS. 4(a)-4(e) show a variety of views of the mechanical assembly drawings of the preferred embodiment of this invention. The detail of the switch body 101 is shown having placement 402a,b for the wire terminals 206a,b, as well as 404 for the switching device 104 and 401 for the insertion of the preferred resistive circuit 105. View 405 shows additional detail of the conductive paths 103a,b,c. And, side views 402, 406 show the side view depicting the dome switch 104. Additional detailed mechanical dimensions are shown in view 407 of the switch body.",
        "The described preferred embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not as restrictive.
