        "The present invention relates generally to equipment for assisting in the assembly, preparation, and/or display of silk floral arrangements and the like. More specifically, the present invention relates to a stand for holding silk floral arrangements and the like during their assembly, preparation, and/or display.",
        "Typically, silk floral arrangements and the like are assembled and/or prepared by inserting a plurality of silk flowers, branches with leaves, etc., the stems of which comprise a plurality of covered or uncovered wires or the like, into a rigid foam base. This foam base may have a substantially conical, tapered, or wedge shape. During the assembly and/or preparation process, it is often difficult for a floral arranger to adequately support and/or manipulate the foam base. The floral arranger needs to have his or her hands free to insert and align the plurality of silk flowers, branches with leaves, etc., and this is made difficult if he or she must also support and/or manipulate the foam base.",
        "Typically, floral arrangers have used vases, jars, or crudely-fashioned, homemade stands to support and/or manipulate the foam bases as they assemble and/or prepare their silk floral arrangements and the like. Often, these vases, jars, or homemade stands are also used to display the silk floral arrangements and the like. The problem with using such equipment, however, is that, because the sizes of the foam blocks vary from floral arrangement to floral arrangement, different vases, jars, or homemade stands must be used for each. This results in an inefficient use of time and added expense.",
        "Thus, what is needed is a stand for holding silk floral arrangements and the like during their assembly, preparation, and/or display that is adjustable and capable of easily accommodating a plurality of foam base sizes. This would free the floral arrangers' hands to insert the plurality of silk flowers, branches with leaves, etc. into a silk floral arrangement or the like and align them, while eliminating the inefficient use of time and added expense of having to provide a plurality of different sized vases, jars, or homemade stands.",
        "In various embodiments, the present invention provides a stand for holding silk floral arrangements and the like during their assembly, preparation, and/or display that is adjustable and capable of easily accommodating a plurality of foam base sizes. This frees a floral arranger's hands to insert a plurality of silk flowers, branches with leaves, etc. into the foam base of a silk floral arrangement or the like and align them, while eliminating the inefficient use of time and added expense of having to provide a plurality of different sized vases, jars, or homemade stands.",
        "In one embodiment, the present invention provides a stand for holding silk floral arrangements that includes a substantially-tubular piece having a longitudinal axis and defining a first cross-sectional interior area at a first position along the longitudinal axis of the substantially-tubular piece and a second cross-sectional interior area at a second position along the longitudinal axis of the substantially-tubular piece. The stand also includes a base piece attached to an end of the substantially-tubular piece, the base piece attached perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the substantially-tubular piece, the base piece configured to support the substantially-tubular piece in an upright alignment. The stand further includes a first area-adjustment piece configured to engage the substantially-tubular piece at the first position along the longitudinal axis of the substantially-tubular piece, the first area-adjustment piece defining a third cross-sectional interior area that is smaller than the first cross-sectional interior area defined at the first position of the substantially-tubular piece. The stand still further includes a second area-adjustment piece configured to engage the substantially-tubular piece at the second position along the longitudinal axis of the substantially-tubular piece, the second area-adjustment piece defining a fourth cross-sectional interior area that is smaller than the second cross-sectional interior area defined at the second position of the substantially-tubular piece.",
        "In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing a stand for holding silk floral arrangements that includes providing a substantially-tubular piece having a longitudinal axis and defining a first cross-sectional interior area at a first position along the longitudinal axis of the substantially-tubular piece and a second cross-sectional interior area at a second position along the longitudinal axis of the substantially-tubular piece.

        "The substantially-tubular piece 12 may have any suitable cross-sectional shape (which may, optionally, be variable along the longitudinal axis 14) and may comprise a solid or partially-solid-walled structure. For example, in the embodiment illustrated, the substantially-tubular piece 12 comprises a plurality of ring members 28 disposed concentrically about the longitudinal axis 14 and a plurality of straight members 30 disposed parallel to the longitudinal axis 14. The plurality of ring members 28 are connected together and held in a fixed relationship with respect to one another by the plurality of straight members 30. The plurality of ring members 28 and the plurality of straight members 30 are made of a substantially-rigid material, such as metal, wood, or plastic, and are connected together using welds, an adhesive, mechanical fasteners, etc.",
        "Preferably, the plurality of ring members 28 and the plurality of straight members 30 each have a thickness or diameter of between about \u215b in. and about \u00bd in., although another suitable dimension may be used. Preferably, the substantially-tubular piece 12 has an overall height of between about 3 in. and about 18 in. and a cross sectional area (which may, optionally, be variable along the longitudinal axis 14) of between about 1 sq. in. and about 20 sq. in., although other suitable dimensions may be used. The cross-sectional shape and area of the substantially-tubular piece 12 are selected such that the substantially-tubular piece is capable of receiving the lower portion 32 of the rigid foam base 34 associated with a silk floral arrangement or the like, while supporting the upper portion 36.",
        "The base piece 24 attached to the end 26 of the substantially-tubular piece 12 may comprise a solid or wire-frame structure. For example, in the embodiment illustrated, the base piece 24 comprises a ring member 38 welded, adhered, or mechanically fastened to radially-extending portions 40 of the plurality of straight members 30. Preferably, the base piece 24 has a size and shape that are sufficient to support the substantially-tubular piece 12 in an upright alignment, especially when a silk floral arrangement or the like is disposed partially within the substantially-tubular piece 12.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2, the stand for holding silk floral arrangements 10 also includes a first area-adjustment piece 42 configured to engage the substantially-tubular piece 12 at the first position 18 along the longitudinal axis 14 of the substantially-tubular piece 12, the first area-adjustment piece 42 defining a third cross-sectional unobstructed interior area 44 that is smaller than the first cross-sectional interior area 16 defined at the first position 18 of the substantially-tubular piece 12. The first area-adjustment piece 42 may comprise a solid or wire-frame structure. For example, in the embodiment illustrated, the first area-adjustment piece 42 comprises a plurality of ring members 46 of varying interior diameter joined together by a plurality of spanning members 48. The first area-adjustment piece 42 is secured relative to the first position 18 of the substantially-tubular piece 12 via a plurality of attachment mechanisms 50, such as a plurality of metal tabs, clips, or the like.",
        "Referring to FIG. 3, the stand for holding silk floral arrangements 10 further includes a second area-adjustment piece 52 configured to engage the substantially-tubular piece 12 at the second position 22 along the longitudinal axis 14 of the substantially-tubular piece 12, the second area-adjustment piece 52 defining a fourth cross-sectional interior area 54 that is smaller than the second cross-sectional interior area 20 defined at the second position 22 of the substantially-tubular piece 12. The second area-adjustment piece 52 may comprise a solid or wire-frame structure. For example, in the embodiment illustrated, the second area-adjustment piece 52 comprises a plurality of ring members 56 of varying interior diameter joined together by a plurality of spanning members 58. The second area-adjustment piece 52 is secured relative to the second position 22 of the substantially-tubular piece 12 via a plurality of attachment mechanisms 60, such as a plurality of metal tabs, clips, or the like.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, in one exemplary configuration of the stand for holding silk floral arrangements 10 of the present invention, the fourth cross-sectional interior area 54 defined by the second area-adjustment piece 52 is smaller than the third cross-sectional interior area 44 defined by the first area-adjustment piece 42. In another exemplary configuration of the stand for holding silk floral arrangements 10 of the present invention, the first cross-sectional interior area 16 defined at the first position 18 of the substantially-tubular piece 12 is equal to the second cross-sectional interior area 20 defined at the second position 22 of the substantially-tubular piece 12.",
        "In general, the stand for holding silk floral arrangements 10 (FIG. 1) may be selectively used with or without the first area-adjustment piece 42 (FIG. 2) and/or the second area-adjustment piece 52 (FIG. 3) depending upon the size and shape of the foam base 34 (FIGS. 1-3) used. For example, the size and shape of the foam base 34 of FIG. 1 require that neither the first area-adjustment piece 42 nor the second area-adjustment piece 52 be used. The size and shape of the foam base 34 of FIG. 2 require that only the first area-adjustment piece 42 be used. Finally, the size and shape of the foam base 34 of FIG. 3 require that both the first area-adjustment piece 42 and the second area-adjustment piece 52 be used. This illustrates the flexibility of the apparatus of the present invention.",
