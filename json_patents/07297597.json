    "abstract": "Conventional fabrication of top oxide in an ONO-type memory cell stack usually produces Bird's Beak. Certain materials in the stack such as silicon nitrides are relatively difficult to oxidize. As a result oxidation does not proceed uniformly along the multi-layered height of the ONO-type stack. The present disclosure shows how radical-based fabrication of top-oxide of an ONO stack (i.e. by ISSG method) can help to reduce formation of Bird's Beak. More specifically, it is indicated that short-lived oxidizing agents (e.g., atomic oxygen) are able to better oxidize difficult to oxidize materials such as silicon nitride and the it is indicated that the short-lived oxidizing agents alternatively or additionally do not diffuse deeply through already oxidized layers of the ONO stack such as the lower silicon oxide layer. As a result, a more uniform top oxide dielectric can be fabricated with more uniform breakdown voltages along its height. Additionally, adjacent low and high voltage transistors may benefit from simultaneous formation of their gate dielectrics with use of the radical-based oxidizing method.",

        "(B) Ser. No. 10/821,100 filed Apr. 7, 2004 by Zhong Dong et al. and which is originally entitled, Method of Forming ONO-Type Sidewall with Reduced Bird's Beak.",
        "So-called, FLASH memory devices and alike forms of electrically re-programmable and nonvolatile memory devices have become commercially popular due, in part, to their ability to store data in a small and dense form factors, their ability to be repeatedly and quickly re-programmed, and their ability to retain programmed data in a nonvolatile fashion so that even when power is lost, the stored data is preserved.",
        "One relatively simple format of such electrically re-programmable nonvolatile memories is known as the vertically-stacked gate configuration. In this configuration, a so-called \u201cfloating gate\u201d (FG) electrode is insulatively sandwiched between an underlying, tunnel insulator layer and an overlying, inter-gates insulator (IGI) layer. A so-called \u201ccontrol gate\u201d (CG) electrode is stacked atop the inter-gates insulator (IGI) layer. In some embodiments (NAND Flash) there is also a select gate (SG) for enabling a group of cells. Under the tunnel insulator layer (beneath the FG) there is typically provided a semiconductive channel region with opposed source (S) and drain (D) regions for defining a multi-gate transistor.",
        "Because of the way the layers stack in the stacked gates memory cell, the IGI layer (inter-gates insulator layer) is sandwiched at least between the floating gate electrode (FG) and the control gate electrode (CG). The inter-gates insulator (IGI) layer typically contains a series of different dielectric materials. The classical combination is that of silicon Oxide, silicon Nitride and again silicon Oxide in the recited order, hence the name, ONO. Such sandwiching of different kinds of dielectric material layers between the gate electrodes, as well as the use of conductive materials to form the gate electrodes can create problems as will be further explained shortly. In passing, it is to be observed that other types of more complicated configurations of gate electrodes are possible beyond the simple stacking of a CG electrode above an FG electrode. These other configurations may include various staggered gate configurations. The example of the simpler, stacked gate configuration will be sufficient for describing the improvement disclosed herein.",
        "The insulatively-isolated floating gate (FG) of a stacked gates cell is intended to store a relatively precise amount of charge and to retain that stored amount of charge even when external power is turned off. The amount of charge stored by the FG can be used to define the data state of the memory cell. The state of the memory cell can be altered by moving additional charge into the FG for representing a first data state and by removing charge from the FG for representing another data state. Different mechanisms may be used for injecting charge into or removing charge from the FG, including hot carrier injection and/or Fowler-Nordheim tunneling.",
        "The charged or uncharged state of the floating gate (FG) can be sensed by applying a cell-read voltage VGS-read to the control gate (CG), where the cell-read voltage VGS-read is selected to cause a first magnitude of current conduction between the drain (D) and source (S) regions of the cell when the floating gate (FG) is in a first programmed state and to cause no or a different magnitude of IDS to flow when the floating gate (FG) is in another programmed state. (Some devices store multiple data bits per cell, where each of different amounts of charge trapped within the FG represents a different multi-bit pattern.) During data write and/or erase operations, it is common to apply relatively large voltages (VGS-write or VGS-erase) to the control gate (CG) so as to induce Fowler-Nordheim tunneling and/or other charge transport mechanisms between the floating gate (FG) and one or more other electrode regions within the memory cell (including source and/or drain regions).",
        "It is important, for purposes of carrying out the various read and write/erase operations of floating gate type memory cells (e.g., stacked gate cells), to establish an appropriate pattern of electric field intensities through the insulators, especially the ones that surround the charge-storing, floating gate (FG). These electric fields (E-fields) may be established by generating correspondingly appropriate voltages between the control gate (CG), the drain (D), the source (S) and/or substrate (U) regions of the memory cell. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that electric field intensity in dielectric insulators is usually a function of voltage difference (V) divided by dielectric thickness (d) and multiplied by dielectric constant (E=kV/d). Capacitive coupling is a function of plate area divided by dielectric thickness (C=f(kA/d)). In order to get consistent results from one mass produced device to the next, it is important to maintain precise control, during mass production, over the per-cell plate-area (A), the dielectric thickness (d) and the dielectric constant (k) of the various insulators which surround the FG of each cell so that same results will occur in one device and the next for a given control gate voltage (VCG). Stated otherwise, consistently same capacitive coupling should occur, without excessive leakage, from one mass produced device to the next as measured between the CG, the FG, the source (S), the drain (D) and the substrate (U).",
        "Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that most insulators are not perfect. A small amount of leakage current can flow through them. They can undergo high voltage breakdown. Contaminating chemicals can pass through pinhole or other defects in the insulators. Much progress has been made in the formation of the so-called, thermal gate oxide insulator that normally lies between the substrate and the floating gate (FG). However, the inter-gates insulator layer (IGI) that is typically sandwiched between the FG and the CG still poses numerous problems.",
        "The inter-gates insulator layer (IGI) is particularly prone to problems with excessive leakage current, premature voltage breakdown, and inconsistent mass production results. Practitioners in the art have developed a so-called ONO solution. According to basic ONO practice, after the material for the floating gate (FG) is deposited (typically it is doped polysilicon), three insulative layers are vapor deposited in sequence. The three insulative layers are respectively composed of silicon-Oxide, silicon-Nitride and silicon-Oxide; hence the ONO acronym. The material for the control gate (CG) is then deposited (typically it is doped polysilicon) on top of the ONO structure. The ONO structure is advantageous because the silicon-nitride (Si3N4) in the middle generally has a greater dielectric constant (k) than does the silicon dioxide (SiO2) at the top and bottom. The higher dielectric constant of the silicon-Nitride layer in the ONO stack allows cell designers to use lower gate voltages than would otherwise be possible for an equal thickness of insulator material made of only silicon-oxide. It is desirable to keep gate voltages relatively small. The ONO approach allows this to happen.",
        "Despite improvements in fabrication techniques, the ONO approach still suffers from various problems including the formation of Bird's Beak between the different material layers of the ONO stack. It is believed that the oxidation-resistant properties of the middle silicon-nitride layer make it difficult to consistently form insulation of both good quality and consistent dimensions during mass production. Silicon nitride resists conventional oxidation more so than does silicon oxide. As a result, when the top oxide of the ONO sequence is being formed after the middle nitride of the ONO stack has already been deposited, part of the oxidation reaction proceeds non-uniformly by diffusing through oxide-containing sidewall areas of the ONO stack and by non-uniformly increasing oxide thickness at the peripheral sides of the floating gate electrode (FG) while leaving the sides and top of the silicon nitride layer relatively un-oxidized. This differential behavior often results in the formation of a Bird's Beak geometry. (A deformity that is V-shaped, with the V rotated about 90 degrees.) As a result, dielectric thickness is no longer uniform across device layers. This in turn makes it more difficult to guarantee consistent device performance for mass-produced memory cells. Often the sidewall portions of the ONO stack are seen to have slightly greater height dimensions than the middle of the ONO stack due to Bird's Beak development. Why this is so will be explained in more detail below. The present disclosure shows how such undesirable Bird's Beak formation may be reduced.",
        "At the same time that the dielectric insulator portions (the ONO sequence) of the ONO stack are being formed, it is sometimes desirable to simultaneously form gate dielectric layers for adjacent, high voltage and/or low voltage transistors so that manufacturing costs can be reduced. The present disclosure shows how such simultaneous formation of gate dielectric layers for adjacent transistors may be carried out while Bird's Beak formation is reduced in the ONO stack.",
        "Structures and methods may be provided in accordance with the present disclosure of invention for improving over the above-described problems.",
        "More specifically, in accordance with one set of aspects of the present disclosure, a high-kinetics, dry oxidation process (ISSG) is used to at least, initiate formation of additional oxide on the top of the nitride layer of the ONO stack, where the process for at least initiating formation of additional oxide includes the generation of atomic oxygen radicals or other such short-lived oxidizing agents for more uniformly producing oxides along exposed nitride-containing regions as well as along exposed silicon-containing regions.",
        "A method in accordance with the present disclosure for forming an ONO-type stack comprises: (a) defining a bottom oxide layer of the ONO-type stack above a substrate, a tunnel oxide and a floating gate layer; (b) defining a middle nitride layer of the ONO-type stack on top of the bottom oxide layer; (c) thermally growing high voltage gate oxide on the substrate; and (d) after the high voltage gate oxide has been grown, generating a sufficient amount of atomic oxygen near said middle nitride layer of the ONO-type stack so as to at least initiate formation of additional oxide on the top of the nitride layer of the ONO type stack. In one set of embodiments, the atomic oxygen generating step is part of a dry ISSG process that includes: (a.1) flowing molecular oxygen (O2) towards the stack; and (a.2) flowing molecular hydrogen (H2) towards the stack, where the volumetric flow ratio of the H2 to the O2 is less than about 0.2.",

Fabrication of the memory cell and the adjacent low and high voltage transistors is still in progress at this point. More work will be done to finish the integrated circuit. For example, the source and drain regions, 107 and 108, which are not yet present and are thus shown in phantom, will be implanted at a later time and self-aligned to sidewalls other than the ones shown in FIG. 1. Distances and other dimensional aspects shown in the diagram are not to scale. The schematic of FIG. 1 may apply to embodiments of the present invention and also embodiments outside the scope of invention, depending on what process are used to arrive at the schematically illustrated structure 100.",
        "The illustrated high voltage transistor 120 (partially formed) may be used to selectively apply high voltage erase and/or high voltage write signals to a control gate (CG, defined by Poly-2 layer 118) of the ONO-type stack 110. The low voltage transistor 130 may be used to selectively apply a lower voltage, read signal to the control gate (118). Low and high voltages are relative terms here, these being dependent on the specific channel lengths and gate dielectric thicknesses used in the structure 100. The high voltage is of course, greater than the low voltage. Dielectrics that are to insulate against the high voltage will generally need to have greater thickness and/or to have better insulating characteristics than dielectrics which are to insulate against the low voltage if leakage currents are to be kept relatively small. Formation of the N and P type source/drain regions like 107 and 109 will happen later in the fabrication process, after the illustrated stacked structures 110, 120, 130 have had their lateral dimensions reduced (e.g., by sidewall etch) so as to provide for shorter channel lengths (e.g., 108).",
        "When the transistor-completing fabrication steps are later completed, and the overall, monolithic integrated circuit (IC) 100 becomes an operable whole (e.g., after it is made to include metal interconnect layers and means for coupling to external systems) and after the completed IC is inserted into a larger circuit, various voltages of different magnitudes will develop at corresponding terminal points of the memory cells (only one shown at 110), and at terminal points of the high voltage transistors (only one shown at 120) and at terminal points of the low voltage transistors (only one shown at 130). In anticipation of these low and high voltages, the gate dielectric layer (HVOX) 126 for the high voltage transistors 120 is made relatively thick while the gate dielectric layer (LVOX) 136 for the low voltage transistors 130 is made comparatively thinner. It is often desirable, for purpose of reducing the number of process steps and thus saving cost and manufacturing time, to form the respective gate electrodes 128 and 138 of the low and high voltage transistors, 120 and 130, at the same time that the so-called Poly-2 layer (second polysilicon layer) is deposited to define the control gate (CG) 118 of the ONO-type stack 110.",
        "At the fabrication phase shown in FIG. 1, a monocrystalline silicon substrate 105 has been provided, a tunnel oxide layer (TOX) 111 has been formed on the substrate by thermal growth or otherwise, then a first polysilicon layer (Poly-1) 112 has been deposited for later defining the floating gate (FG) of the corresponding memory cell stack 110. On top of the Poly-1 layer 112, a first silicon oxide layer (SiO-1) 114 has been formed to begin definition of the so-called, ONO stack 117. This has been followed by deposition of a silicon nitride layer (SiN-2) 115 and subsequent formation of a second silicon oxide layer (SiO-3) 116. Although the construction of the device 100 of FIG. 1 is couched here in past tense, use of the past tense for FIG. 1 does not indicate that any specific working example has been fabricated per the description of FIG. 1. The triad of layers defined by the SiO-1 layer 114, the SiN-2 layer 115 and the SiO-3 layer 116 will form the ONO insulation stack 117. (Although a conventional, oxide-nitride-oxide combination is described for purpose of this example, it is within the contemplation of the invention to provide other dielectric materials in place of those shown in the fundamental ONO stack 117. For example, a NONO stack may include oxynitride layers within it. The gate electrodes may be made of conductive materials other than doped polysilicon.)",
        "After the SiO-3 layer 116 was defined in FIG. 1, but before the illustrated tower structure 110 was shaped by way of lithographic patterning to look like a tower, a second polysilicon layer (Poly-2) 118 was deposited for later defining the so-called, control gate (CG) of the corresponding memory cell. On top of the Poly-2 layer 118, a sacrificial passivating layer of silicon nitride (SiN-Pad, not shown) was formed. Then photolithography and/or other patterning steps were used to define an etch mask (not shown). An etchback was performed down to the top surface of the semiconductor substrate 105 so as to thereby leave behind the tower-like shape of the illustrated ONO memory cell stack 110 protruding from the substrate 105 as shown in FIG. 1. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many copies of the illustrated one ONO memory cell stack 110 will be protruding from the substrate and that the copies will be in spaced apart relation to one another after the etchback process is performed. For sake of simplicity, only one ONO tower is shown. Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that the etchback through the different material layers of the ONO tower\u2014that is, through the nitrides, oxides and polysilicon layers of the example\u2014will typically entail different etch chemistries, each tailored to selectively remove the targeted material. Such details are not relevant to the present disclosure. What is relevant is that the memory cell tower is produced with different materials that can behave differently when exposed to an oxidizing environment. This can lead to formation of Bird's Beak as will be shortly seen.",
        "FIG. 2A is a schematic, side cross sectional diagram showing an intermediate stage 200 of a conventional process for forming an ONO memory stack 210 as well as adjacent low and high voltage transistors (not yet shown). Where practical, like reference numbers in the \u201c200\u201d century series are used for elements of FIG. 2A which correspond to but are not necessarily the same as the elements represented by similar symbols and reference numbers of the \u201c100\u201d century series in FIG. 1. In FIG. 2A, layers 211, 212, 214 and 215 have been formed by a suitable set 210 of layer deposition or growth steps. Then a first, masked etchback 202 was performed to leave behind the partial tower structure shown at 210. Next thermal oxidation 203a is commenced for oxidizing the exposed surfaces of the substrate 205 and the SiN-2 layer 215. The in-process ONO stack 217a now contains SiO layer 214 and SiN layer 215.",
        "FIG. 2B is a schematic, side cross sectional diagram showing a subsequent, second intermediate stage 200\u2032 of the conventional process. Thermal oxidation step 203b is about to finish. A relatively thick oxide layer 221 has grown from the exposed substrate 205, and as can be seen, the thick oxide layer 221 is to be later used for defining the high voltage gate dielectric region 226 of a planned, high voltage transistor 220. At the same time that thick oxide layer 221 was grown; a relatively thinner, thermal oxide layer 219 also grew on top of SiN layer 215. Silicon atoms for the thinner oxide layer 219 were scavenged out from SiN layer 215\u2032. As a result, the concentration of nitrogen atoms at the top of SiN layer 215\u2032 increased. The more nitrogen rich top of SiN layer 215\u2032 then functioned as an oxidation stop, blocking further growth of layer 219. The in-process ONO stack 217b now contains SiO layer 214, SiN layer 215\u2032 with its nitrogen rich top, and thermal oxide layer 219.",
        "FIG. 2C is a schematic, side cross sectional diagram showing a subsequent, third intermediate stage 200\u2033 of the conventional process. A second masked etchback 204 was performed to leave behind the partial tower structure shown at 210\u2033 as well as the tower structure 220 at which the high voltage transistor will form. The in-process ONO stack 217c now contains SiO layer 214 and SiN layer 215\u2033 with its nitrogen rich top, but with its silicon oxide crest (219) removed.",
        "FIG. 2D is a schematic, side cross sectional diagram showing a subsequent, fourth intermediate stage 200\u2032\u2033 of the conventional process. An oxide deposition process 250 has been commenced to begin forming the top-oxide material layer 216 of the ONO stack 217d. High Temperature Oxidation (HTO) is conventionally used as the oxide deposition process 250. One particular HTO process flows DCS (dichlorosilane) and nitrous oxide (N2O) over the exposed ONO memory cell stacks 210\u2032\u2033 (only one shown) in order to trigger an exothermic reaction which releases molecular oxidizing agents (e.g., O2) along the exposed tops and sidewalls of the ONO towers 210\u2032\u2033. The DCS plus N2O reaction simultaneously decomposes the DCS to provide silicon atoms for deposition and oxidation about the towers. At the same time, oxide deposition layer 256 forms on HVOX base 226\u2033. LVOX deposition layer 236 forms in the vicinity 230 of planned low voltage transistors. Although not shown, masking for the patterned formation of the illustrated silicon oxide depositions 216, 256 and 236 may be provided concurrently or it may be provided afterwards for use in patterned etchback of the deposited oxide.",
        "Of importance, during HTO deposition 250, the oxidizing agents 252 of the HTO deposition process do not interact only with the top of the ONO stack 217d as is indicated by flow path 255. The HTO oxidizing agents 252 also interact with the exposed sidewalls of tower 210\u2032\u2033 as is indicated by flow paths 253 and 254. Polysilicon material, such as that present at the sidewalls of layer 212\u2032\u2033, tends to oxidize rapidly in the presence of the high temperature, molecular oxygen (O2) released by the HTO process 250. On the other hand, silicon nitride, such as that present at the topside and sidewalls of layer 215\u2032\u2033 does not usually oxidize as readily as does the polysilicon. The SiN material layer 215\u2032\u2033 also blocks the molecular oxygen (O2) from diffusing through its material. Conversely, the silicon oxide material of layer 214 may permit the molecular oxygen (O2) of flow 254 to diffuse through with relative ease and to attack the upper, oxide-coated surface of polysilicon layer 212\u2032\u2033. Accordingly, oxide is formed at different rates along the sidewalls of the ONO towers 210\u2032\u2033 as well as on the top surface 215\u2032\u2033/216 of the ONO towers when the conventional oxidation process (HTO) is used. More specifically, it has been observed that the sidewall encroachment distance by which silicon oxide forms along the nitride sidewall parts (e.g., on the vertical sides of SiN-2 region 215\u2032\u2033) tends to be about one tenth (0.1 factor) the encroachment distance by which silicon oxide forms along the polysilicon parts of the sidewalls (e.g., on the vertical sides of Poly-2 region 212\u2032\u2033). As a result, a non-uniform distribution of dielectric material develops.",
        "FIG. 2E is a schematic, side cross sectional diagram showing a subsequent, fifth intermediate stage 200\u2032\u2033 of the conventional process. The oxide deposition process 250 has completed even though it is shown in phantom at 250\u2032. The rapid formation of silicon oxide around layer 212\u2033\u2033 has produced Bird's Beak formation 256 (composed of silicon oxide). A second polysilicon layer 218 was subsequently deposited for defining the control gate (CG). A sacrificial silicon nitride layer 259 was formed on the polysilicon layer 218. For sake of illustrative convenience, tower 210\u2033\u2033 is shown alone without the adjacent low and high voltage transistor towers (220\u2033 and 230 of FIG. 2D). The Bird's Beak formations 256 tend to produce height distortions, as are schematically illustrated at 258. Schematic icon 258 indicates that the heights of the sidewall portions (outer edges) of the memory cell ONO stack 210\u2033\u2033 are noticeably greater than the height of the central portion of the same stack 210\u2033\u2033. The Bird's Beak formation can produce undesirable stresses in the stack 210\u2033\u2033 as well as non uniform electric field distributions, different effective plate areas for the capacitive structures, and premature voltage breakdown. It would therefore be advantageous if practical methods could be found for reducing or eliminating Bird's Beak formation while still being able to form a silicon oxide layer like 216 of FIG. 2D simultaneously with formation of the silicon oxide layers 256 and 236 of the low and high voltage transistors.",
        "FIG. 3 is a schematic, side cross sectional diagram showing an alternate fourth intermediate stage 300 that, in accordance with the invention, replaces stage 200\u2032\u2033 of FIG. 2D of the conventional process. Where practical, like reference symbols and numbers in the \u201c300\u201d primed series are used for elements of FIG. 3 which correspond to but are not necessarily the same as the elements represented by similar primed symbols and reference numbers of the \u201c200\u201d series in FIG. 2D. As such, a repeated introduction is not necessary. In FIG. 3, instead of relying on HTO, the oxide deposition process 350 uses a high-kinetics, dry oxidation process (dry-ISSG) to at least initially begin oxidizing the top of SiN layer 315\u2032\u2033 of the ONO tower 310. \u201cISSG\u201d is an industry-recognized acronym for In-Situ Steam Generation. However, despite its name, wet steam is not formed in dry-ISSG. Instead, a stream of H2 is typically supplied in the presence of a volumetrically, faster flowing stream of O2 and in the presence of heat (e.g., provided from InfraRed lamps (IR source) 360) to thereby produce free atomic oxygen (e.g., O\u2212\u2212) and/or other radicals (not molecularly bound) which can combine with the materials in the multi-layered tower 310 to form topside dielectric layer 316 on the nitride-containing layer 315\u2032\u2033. ISSG-initiated oxide forms more uniformly on nitride-containing surfaces (e.g., topside of SiN-2 layer 315\u2032\u2033) as well as on oxide-containing surfaces (e.g., topside of HVOX layer 326\u2033) and on silicon-containing surfaces (e.g., topside of substrate 305, in area 330, where LVOX layer 336 starts forming as a result of the ISSG process 350).",
        "Use of the dry-ISSG process has been found to reduce Bird's Beak formation as shall be explained below with reference to FIG. 4A. In one set of embodiments for the ISSG process 350 of FIG. 3, the volumetric flow ratio of H2/O2 (each in terms of sccm) is less than about 0.2. In a subset of these embodiments, the volumetric flow ratio of H2/O2 is less than about 0.1. In another subset of these embodiments, the volumetric flow ratio of H2/O2 is equal to, or less than, about 0.02.",
        "It is believed that ISSG-produced free atomic oxygen (e.g., O\u2212\u2212 as illustrated at 352) and/or hydroxyl radicals (e.g., OH as illustrated at 329) and/or other radicals tend to form readily adjacent to the topside sites where the silicon oxide dielectric will initially and desirably begin to form, namely, at the topside of SiN-2 layer 315\u2032\u2033 where SiO-3 layer 316 is to form, at the topside of HVOX layer 326\u2033 where SiO layer 356 is to form, and at the topside of substrate 305, in area 330, where the LVOX layer 336 is to start forming. The radiation direction of the IR lamps 360 may play a role in preferential formation of radicals at topside surfaces. It is believed that some of the ISSG-produced radicals may continue to proceed along non-vertical paths 353 and 354 for possible formation of Bird's Beak oxide in the lateral direction between, for example, Poly-1 layer 312\u2032\u2033 and SiO-1 layer 314. However, it is believed that such sidewall-approaching radicals (of non-vertical paths 353 and 354) are relatively few and short-lived in comparison to the radicals that form along the more, substantially vertical approach paths 355, 358a and 359 shown in FIG. 3. It is believed that as a result of the shorter lives of the laterally-approaching radicals 353-354, the Bird's Beak formation at the tower sidewalls is reduced in comparison to what would have formed (formation 257 of FIG. 2E) had HTO process 250\u2032 (FIG. 2E) been used instead. In one embodiment of the dry-ISSG process 350 (FIG. 3), a dry and low-pressure mixture of hydrogen gas (H2) and oxygen gas (O2) is streamed over a wafer while the wafer is rapidly heated (e.g., by RTP heating\u2014rapid thermal process heating such as by way of IR radiation) to a high temperature of about 1000\u00b0 C. The combination of supplied reactant gases and heat tends to generate both atomic oxygen (which could be in charged or neutral forms such as: O\u2212\u2212, O\u2212, O0, O+, O++) and hydroxyl radicals (OH), more so\u2014it is believed\u2014at the exposed topside surfaces (315\u2032\u2033) of the tower 310 that at the exposed sidewall surfaces of that tower. The atomic oxygen and/or hydroxyl radicals can diffuse into the exposed surface materials at various diffusion rates to produce correspondingly oxidized reaction products. An Applied Materials Centura\u2122 Rapid-Thermal-Processing (RTP) reactor may be used for carrying out the dry-ISSG process. The Centura\u2122 RTP tool (available from Applied Materials of Santa Clara, Calif.) can be modified to provide an ISSG operation with the volumetric flow ratio of H2/O2 being less than about 0.3 (that is, 30%), less than about 0.1 (10%), and even as low as about 0.02 (2%).",
        "More specifically, in one embodiment according to the present disclosure, an ISSG recipe is used in an Applied Materials Centura\u2122 Rapid-Processing (RTP) reactor as set forth in Table 1.",

        "Step 8 of Table 1 is where most of the dry-ISSG occurs to provide topside oxidation to a thickness of about 30-70 \u212b. The process can be varied as appropriate to provide ISSG-generated topside oxide in thickness range of about 20 \u212b to about 300 \u212b. The ISSG operating temperature may be set in, or varied over the range of about 850\u00b0 C. to about 1050\u00b0 C. The ISSG process maintenance time may be set in, or varied over the range of about 20 seconds to about 300 seconds. The O2 flow rate may be set in, or varied over the range of about 3 slm to about 10 slm. The H2 flow rate may be set in, or varied over the range of about 0.1 slm to about 1 slm. The H2/O2 volumetric flow ratio may be set in, or varied over the range of about 0.3 to about 0.01, and in one subset of embodiments, in, or over the range of about 0.1 to about 0.02. Pressure in the RTP chamber may be set in, or varied over the range of about 5 Torr to about 50 Torr.",
        "Referring still to FIG. 3, the locations where the oxidizing agents of the ISSG process 350 may react is examined in more detail to clarify some points. Although the additional height 356 for the high-voltage-transistor dielectric is drawn at the top of HVOX block 326\u2033, the actual mechanism by which that additional height 356 is attained is believed to be from the bottom up. The path 358a of travel and formation for the ISSG oxidizing agents continues vertically through the pre-formed HVOX block 326\u2033 by diffusion to reach the underlying silicon in substrate 305. There, the ISSG oxidizing agents react with the silicon to form fresh silicon oxide which pushes the oxide above higher. For sake of illustrative convenience, the continued path is drawn at 358b, outside the HVOX block 326\u2033 even though diffusion is through that block. Some of the oxidizing agents present within the continued path 358b may react with silicon oxide material in the HVOX block 326\u2033 to thereby increase the degree of oxidation in the block 326\u2033 and to thereby form a more perfected SiO2 composition within the block 326\u2033. As a result the insulative properties of the dielectric material of block 326\u2033 is enhanced. The ability of the later-completed high voltage transistor (320\u2033) to withstand relatively large voltages across its gate dielectric is enhanced. This is indirectly demonstrated in FIG. 4C by the improved dielectric characteristics of the low voltage transistor 330.",
        "Although it is believed that atomic oxygen (352) is the primary oxidizing agent, it is possible that other byproducts (e.g., OH radicals 329) of the ISSG process may also act as oxidizing agents. It is believed that the atomic oxidizing agents 352/329 supplied at topside surfaces of tower 310 and transistor areas 320, 330 are highly reactive, particularly when energized by the radiation of the RTP lamps 360. As a result, they are able to initiate thermal growth of silicon oxide and/or silicon oxynitrides (SiOxNy) even at the nitride rich, topside surface of SiN layer 315\u2032\u2033. Oxidation rates on the order of as much as about 0.6 of silicon oxidation rates are believed possible at the nitride topside surface of SiN layer 315\u2032\u2033. Some of the ISSG produced, oxidizing agents, 353-354, may diffuse into exposed silicon oxide layers (e.g., 314) to thereby attack the topside of the Poly-1 layer 312\u2032\u2033 and to thereby produce some amount of Bird's Beak formation. However, because of the short life span and/or high reactivity of such ISSG produced, oxidizing agents, 353-354, it is believed that they extinguish rapidly and do not penetrate as deeply into the silicon oxide layer (314) and/or to the same extent as can the longer-lived oxidizing agents (e.g., 253\u2032, 254\u2032 in FIG. 2E) of HTO processes. As a result, Bird's Beak formation is reduced (as will be demonstrated shortly by experimental results).",
        "FIG. 4A is a comparative graph 400 of experimental results. ONO towers were fabricated in substantially same ways except that the results of vertical bar 410 came from use of the HTO process (see 250 of FIG. 2D) for forming the upper silicon oxide layer 216 while the results of vertical bar 430 came from use of the dry-ISSG process (see 350/360 of FIG. 3) for forming the upper silicon oxide layer 316 of its respective ONO towers. After the towers were finished, measurements were taken of the resultant inner and outer stack heights, Hinner and Houter. Statistical regression was used to reduce experimental noise, and height variation ratios, RH=Houter/Hinner were computed respectively for the statistically-corrected results of the HTO oxidation process and the ISSG-based oxidation process. As indicated in the bar graph 400, the computed RH value for the HTO-based devices was found to be about 1.33 and the computed RH value for the ISSG-based devices was found to be about 1.28. This may not seem like a big difference, but it can be. FIG. 4A uses iconic bar symbols 410 and 430 to visually demonstrate the difference. The ratio between the outer edge height of first iconic bar symbol 410 and its indented, inner height is about 1.33. The ratio between the outer edge height of second iconic bar symbol 430 and its indented, inner height is about 1.28. It can be visually appreciated from these that the represented amount of vertical height deformation is significantly different. When Bird's Beak formation occurs, as is shown in FIG. 2E, the outer height, Houter will be larger than the inner height, Hinner by the amount indicated at 258. Such deformation, even if small, can create undesired stress and can change the effective capacitive plate area and/or the dielectric breakdown characteristics of the ONO stack 217e. FIG. 4A shows that there was less Bird's Beak formation in the ISSG-based ONO towers 430 than in HTO-based ONO towers 410 by virtue of RH being about 1.28 in the experiments of bar 430 and RH being about 1.33 in the experiments of bar 410.",
        "FIG. 4B is a second bar graph 402 showing breakdown voltage results for memory cells having HTO formed top-oxide and for memory cells having ISSG formed top-oxide. Breakdown is measured in terms of megavolts per centimeter of ONO thickness (MV/cm). Breakdown test were performed by plotting IV curves (current versus voltage) for capacitor structures having the ONO stack under-test as their dielectric. There are different measures for when breakdown is said to be occurring. In some situations, the reaching of a specific magnitude of ILEAK with increasing voltage, such as the one microampere (1E-06 A) level for a standard capacitor plate area (e.g., 1 mm2), is deemed as a soft breakdown voltage (VBsoft). A rapid increase of ILEAK by one or more orders of magnitude for a small increase of stress voltage is often deemed as the hard breakdown voltage (VBhard). VBhard is generally larger than VBsoft and varies depending on quality and thickness of the stressed dielectric. It may be seen from FIG. 4B that test were carried out for soft breakdown voltage-per-cm of ONO thickness (BV1E-6) and for hard breakdown voltage-per-cm of ONO thickness (BVHD). In both instances, the ONO stacks having to top-oxide formed by the ISSG method (FIG. 3) exhibited comparatively higher breakdown voltages than comparative ONO stacks having to top-oxide formed by the HTO method (FIG. 2D). More specifically, bar 421 shows a soft breakdown field intensity (BV1E-6) of about 12.1 megavolts/cm for the ONO stacks with top-oxide formed by the HTO method while bar 431 shows a greater soft breakdown field intensity (BV1E-6) of about 12.5 megavolts/cm for the ONO stacks with top-oxide formed by the ISSG method. Bar 422 shows a hard breakdown field intensity (BVHD) of about 15.2 megavolts/cm for the ONO stacks with top-oxide formed by the HTO method while bar 432 shows a greater hard breakdown field intensity (BVHD) of about 16.2 megavolts/cm for the ONO stacks with top-oxide formed by the ISSG method.",
        "FIG. 4C is a third bar graph 403 showing breakdown voltage results for adjacent low voltage transistors having HTO formed gate dielectric and for adjacent low voltage transistors having ISSG formed gate dielectric. Breakdown was determined in terms of megavolts per centimeter of gate dielectric thickness (MV/cm). Bar 441 shows a hard breakdown field intensity (BVHD) of about 14 megavolts/cm for the low voltage transistors having gate dielectric formed by the HTO method while bar 451 shows a greater hard breakdown field intensity (BVHD) of about 15 megavolts/cm for the low voltage transistors having gate dielectric formed by the ISSG method. This demonstrates that the use of ISSG to react with silicon from the substrate and to produce silicon oxide produces a dielectric with better ability to withstand high voltages before breakdown as compared to use of HTO for forming the gate dielectrics of the low voltage transistors. The combination of FIGS. 4B and 4C demonstrates that the use of ISSG to react with silicon-nitride for forming top-oxide in the ONO stacks and to react with silicon for forming the gate dielectrics of adjacent low voltage transistors provides a combination of memory cells and low voltage transistors that are better able to withstand high voltages before breakdown as compared to use of HTO for forming counterpart combinations of memory cells and low voltage transistors. Because part of the gate dielectric in the high voltage transistors is also formed by ISSG when the ISSG process 350/360 of FIG. 3 is used, it may be expected that the gate dielectrics of high voltage transistors also exhibit a better ability to withstand high voltages before breakdown as compared to use of HTO for forming counterpart high voltage transistors.",
