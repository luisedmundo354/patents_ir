        "This Nonprovisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 119(a) on Patent Applications Nos. 2003-22461, 2003-22412, 2003-22364, all filed in Japan on Jan. 30, 2003, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "The present invention relates to heaters heating a medium under heat and pressure, as well as image forming apparatuses and heating methods incorporating such a heater.",
        "When used as a fixer fixing an developing agent on a recording medium in copying machines, printers, and other electrophotographic image forming apparatuses, heaters heating a medium (heated material) under heat and pressure are typically arranged to operate according to heat roller fixing.",
        "A fixer arranged to operate according to heat roller fixing has a pair of rollers (heat and pressure rollers) disposed to press each other. Inside the roller (heat roller) in contact with the toner image side of a recording medium (recording paper) is provided heating means, such as a halogen heater.",
        "The heat roller is heated to a predetermined temperature (fixing temperature) by the heating means. Then, a recording medium carrying an unfixed toner image is passed through a pressure application section (fix nip section) of the heat and pressure rollers where the toner image is fixed under heat and pressure.",
        "A disadvantage of heat roller fixing is that it takes a long time (warm-up time) for the heat roller to reach the fixing temperature after the onset of its heating. For convenience, the heat roller needs to be pre-heated when in standby. Power consumption in warm-up and standby is considerable.",
        "To address the problems, fixers have been proposed recently which implement thin heat roller fixing. Japanese unexamined patent application 9-244448 (Tokukaihei 9-244448/1997; published on Sep. 19, 1997), for example, discloses such a fixer.",
        "The thin-heat-roller-fixing fixer includes a heat roller with core metal having a reduced thickness for a reduced thermal capacity. The warm-up time is thus reduced, which reduces the warm-up and standby power consumption.",
        "However, in thin heat roller fixing, the heat roller can be reduced in thickness relatively easily in low-to-medium speed apparatuses (e.g., capable of making less than 50 A4 copies per minute when the recording paper is fed in landscape orientation), but only with difficulty in high speed apparatuses (e.g., capable of making 50 or more A4 copies per minute when the recording paper is fed in landscape orientation).",
        "These are reasons why high speed apparatuses have longer warm-up time (typically 3 minutes or longer) and greater power consumption. Referring to FIG. 16, the following will describe difficulties in incorporating a thin heat roller in high speed apparatuses.",
        "FIG. 16 is a graph showing relationships between a nip transit time, a heat roller temperature (roller temperatures), and a pressure applied to recording paper in the fix nip section (surface pressures) in conventional low-to-medium and high speed apparatuses.",
        "The nip transit time is also called the duel time. It is the width of the fix nip section divided by the fixing rate (transport speed of recording paper) and represents the time taken for any given point on recording paper to pass through the fix nip section. A greater copy rate normally means a shorter nip transit time.",
        "It would be understood from FIG. 16 that the low-to-medium speed apparatus uses higher fix roller temperatures to achieve a greater copy rate, i.e., to compensate for a shorter nip transit time and by doing so, applies an adequate quantity of heat to the recording paper to ensure sufficient fixing performance. The surface pressure is therefore substantially constant regardless of nip transit time.",
        "The high speed apparatus must work at a greater fixing rate than the low-to-medium speed apparatus, resulting in a nip transit time of 23 ms (2.3\u00d710\u22122 sec.) or less. Meanwhile, the always-on temperature for the heat roller is limited (for example, to 200\u00b0 C.) in an ordinary situation. In view of heat resistance issues of the heat roller, the heat roller temperature cannot be raised exceeding the limit temperature. The high speed apparatus therefore ensures sufficient fixing performance by means of a high surface pressure while maintaining a constant heat roller temperature (at the limit temperature).",
        "This places a heavy load on the heat roller, which unlike in the low-to-medium speed apparatus inhibits the provision of a thin heat roller in the high speed apparatus. Thus, the warm-up time is difficult to reduce. A result is great power consumption.",
        "In addition, the heavy load on the heat roller causes the heat roller to creep and suffers from a shortened lifetime, as well as causes the recording paper to crease and curl up.",
        "Further, the difficulties in reducing the heat roller thickness invite increases in size of the apparatus. In addition, the heat roller will have an increased drive torque which in turn entails increased power consumption and shortened driver components lifetime.",
        "To address the aforementioned large warm-up and standby power consumption problems, fixers implementing external roller heating (hereinafter, \u201cexternal roller heating fixers\u201d) have also been proposed recently. Japanese unexamined patent application 2000-338818 (Tokukai 2000-338818; published on Dec. 8, 2000), for example, discloses such a fixer.",
        "An external roller heating fixer incorporates an external heat roller into the fixer implementing heat roller fixing. The external heat roller is an auxiliary heating means for the pressure roller. It contacts the pressure roller to externally heat the surface of the pressure roller.",
        "This raises the surface temperature of the pressure roller and unlike in the fixer for heat roller fixing, enables the pressure roller to actively supply thermal energy to the recording paper. The warm-up time is thus reduce, and so is the pre-heating of the heat roller in standby, enabling reductions in power consumption.",
        "In addition, the pressure roller actively supplying additional thermal energy to the recording paper allows reductions in the fixing load to the recording paper. This prevents the recording paper passing through the fix nip section from curling up.",
        "Further, the reduced fixing load opens up possibilities that the fixer may be used in high speed apparatus generally regarded as requiring a heavy fixing load (e.g., 55 or more A4 copies [sheets] per minute when the recording paper is fed in landscape orientation, or a 23 millisecond or less transit time taken for any given point on recording paper to pass through the fix nip section). Thanks to the reduced fixing load, the external roller heating fixer allows the use of a heat roller which is reduced in thickness and/or diameter, hence in thermal capacity. The fixer thereby shortens the warm-up time and accordingly reduces power consumption. For these reasons, the fixer is suitably applied in the high speed apparatus field.",
        "The pressure roller in the external roller heating fixer has however a higher surface temperature and thus dissipates more heat from the surface than the counterpart in the fixer for heat roller fixing. The external heat roller also dissipates heat from the surface.",
        "Therefore, under some structural and physical conditions of the external heat roller, such as its diameter, thickness, the load it exerts to the pressure roller, and its surface temperature, the fixer dissipates too much heat, which possibly causes poor heat efficiency, higher internal temperature, and like problems. An outcome may be the opposite of what is intended in the first place: greater power consumption than the fixer for heat roller fixing.",
        "The present invention has a first objective to provide a power saving heater with a heat roller receiving less load, and an image forming apparatus and heating method incorporating the same.",
        "To achieve the first objective, a heater in accordance with the present invention includes a first heating member and a second heating member pressing each other, heats a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where the first heating member and the second heating member meet, and is characterized in that the heater includes an external heating member heating the second heating member from outside the second heating member, wherein: a transit time taken for any given point on the heated material to pass through the press region is less than or equal to 2.3\u00d710\u22122 sec.; and a surface temperature, T1 (\u00b0 C.), of the first heating member and a surface temperature, T2 (\u00b0 C.), of the second heating member satisfy T1-T2\u2266100 (\u00b0 C.) and preferably satisfy T1-T2\u226670 (\u00b0 C.).",
        "According to the arrangement, the surface temperature, T1 (\u00b0 C.), of the first heating member and the surface temperature, T2 (\u00b0 C.), of the second heating member satisfy either T1-T2\u2266100 (\u00b0 C.) or T1-T2\u226670 (\u00b0 C.). This eliminates the need for an increase in surface pressure in the press region even in a high speed apparatus for which the transit time taken for any given point on the heated material to pass through the press region is less than or equal to 2.3\u00d710\u22122 sec. In other words, the arrangement allows for a smaller load being applied to the heating members.",
        "This allows for construction of thinner and smaller thermal capacity heating members, and hence reduces the warm-up time of the heater. Therefore, pre-heating of the heating members becomes unnecessary. Power consumption in warm-up and standby is lowered.",
        "The less load on the heating- members, for example, prevents the heating members from creeping and extends the heating members' lifetime.",
        "Further, the reduced thickness of the heating members allows for construction of a more compact heater. The reduced drive torque of the heating members allows for lower power consumption and extends lifetime of driver components.",
        "To achieve the first objective, a heater in accordance with the present invention includes a first heating member and a second heating member pressing each other, heats a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where the first heating member and the second heating member meet, and is characterized in that: a transit time taken for any given point on the heated material to pass through the press region is less than or equal to 2.3\u00d710\u22122 sec.; and a quantity, Q1, of heat transferred from the first heating member to the heated material while the heated material is passing through the press region and a quantity, Q2, of heat transferred from the second heating member to the heated material while the heated material is passing through the press region satisfy Q2/(Q1+Q2)\u22670.25, and preferably satisfy Q2/(Q1+Q2)\u22670.3.",
        "For example, when the material composing the second heating member has extremely poor heat conductivity, the second heating member in some cases transfers only an insufficient quantity of heat to the heated material, failing to provide sufficient heating, even if the surface of the second heating member is maintained at a high temperature.",
        "However, the arrangement specifies the quantity of heat transferred to the heated material, not the temperature of the heating members. Regardless of from what material the heating members are made, similar effects are achieved to a case where the aforementioned surface temperature, T1, of the first heating member and surface temperature, T2, of the second heating member are determined to satisfy T1-T2\u226670 (\u00b0 C.).",
        "In other words, the arrangement allows the load on the heating members to be reduced and enables lower power consumption.",
        "To achieve the first objective, an image forming apparatus in accordance with the present invention is characterized in that it includes: an image transfer device forming an image of an unfixed toner on the heated material; and the heater described above fixing the unfixed toner on the heated material.",
        "The arrangement provides a low power consumption image forming apparatus. In addition, for example, the heater can be used as a fixer. This enables reductions in power consumption through the smaller load, while securing toner's fixing performance, and prevents recording paper which is a heated material from creasing and curling up.",
        "The arrangement also provides image forming apparatus containing a heater made up of long-life heating members and driver components.",
        "To achieve the first objective, a heating method in accordance with the present invention is a method of heating a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where a first heating member and a second heating member meet so that any given point on the heated material passes through the press region in 2.3\u00d710\u22122 sec., and is characterized in that the method involves the step of heating the second heating member by an external heating member from outside the second heating member so that a surface temperature, T1 (\u00b0 C.), of the first heating member and a surface temperature, T2 (\u00b0 C.), of the second heating member satisfy T1-T2\u2266100 (\u00b0 C.), and preferably satisfy T1-T2\u226670 (\u00b0 C.).",
        "According to the method, the surface temperature, T1 (\u00b0 C.), of the first heating member and the surface temperature, T2 (\u00b0 C.), of the second heating member satisfy either T1-T2\u2266100 (\u00b0 C.) or T1-T2\u226670 (\u00b0 C.). This eliminates the need for an increase in surface pressure in the press region even in a high speed apparatus for which the transit time taken for any given point on the heated material to pass through the press region is less than or equal to 2.3\u00d710\u22122 sec. In other words, the method allows for a smaller load being applied to the heating members.",
        "This allows for construction of thinner and smaller thermal capacity heating members, and hence reduces the warm-up time of the heater implementing the heating method. Therefore, pre-heating of the heating members becomes unnecessary. Power consumption in warm-up and standby is lowered.",
        "To achieve the first objective, a heating method in accordance with the present invention is a method of heating a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where a first heating member and a second heating member meet so that any given point on the heated material passes through the press region in 2.3\u00d710\u22122 sec., and is characterized in that the method involves the step of controlling so that a quantity, Q1, of heat transferred from the first heating member to the heated material while the heated material is passing through the press region and a quantity, Q2, of heat transferred from the second heating member to the heated material while the heated material is passing through the press region satisfy Q2/(Q1+Q2)\u22670.25, and preferably satisfy Q2(Q1+Q2)\u22670.3.",
        "The method specifies the quantity of heat transferred to the heated material, not the temperature of the heating members.

In other words, the method allows the load on the heating members to be reduced and enables lower power consumption.",
        "The present invention has a second objective to provide a power saving and/or heat efficiency improving heater, an image forming apparatus incorporating the heater, and a heating method, even if there is provided an external heating member heating the heating members so that the heating members heating heated material have predetermined temperatures.",
        "To achieve the second objective, a heater in accordance with the present invention includes a first heating member and a second heating member pressing each other, heats a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where the first heating member and the second heating member meet, and is characterized in that the heater includes an external heating member rotating with the second heating member in contact with the second heating member and heating the second heating member so that the second heating member has a predetermined surface temperature, wherein a heating nip transit time taken for any given point on the second heating member in rotation to pass through a heating nip region where the second heating member contacts the external heating member is determined based on a material and thermal capacity of the external heating member, a power consumption in the heater while the heated material is passing through the press region, and a surface temperature of the external heating member while the heated material is passing through the press region.",
        "According to the arrangement, the heating nip transit time can be determined in accordance with the material and thermal capacity of the external heating member so that, for example, the power consumption in the heater (first, second, and external heating members) while the heated material is passing through the press region is smaller than that in a heater without an external heating member and the surface temperature of the external heating member while the heated material is passing through the press region does not exceed a predetermined temperature (for example, heat resistance temperature).",
        "Therefore, power consumption can be lowered by arranging the heater so as to achieve the determined heating nip transit time in this manner, although the external heating member is included.",
        "To achieve the second objective, a heater in accordance with the present invention includes a first heating member and a second heating member pressing each other, heats a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where the first heating member and the second heating member meet, and is characterized in that the heater includes an external heating member heating the second heating member so that the second heating member has a predetermined surface temperature, wherein the heated material passes through the press region between the first heating member and the second heating member either upward or downward.",
        "According to the arrangement, the direction in which the heated material passes through the press region (transport direction for the heated material) is substantially vertical. A region is therefore downward with respect to the first and second heating members. This lowers heat dissipation by convection from the first and second heating members.",
        "The air heated in the heater remain in the lower space than the first and second heating members, heating the second heating member. The heat efficiency of the heater is improved.",
        "To achieve the second objective, an image forming apparatus in accordance with the present invention is characterized in that it includes: an image transfer device forming an image of an unfixed toner on the heated material; and the heater described above fixing the unfixed toner on the heated material.",
        "According to the arrangement, the heater can be used as a fixer. The arrangement provides a low power consumption image forming apparatus. In addition, for example, when the heater is applied to a high speed image forming apparatus, the heater enables reductions in power consumption through the smaller load even in a high speed apparatus, while securing toner's fixing performance, and prevents recording paper (recording medium) which is a heated material from creasing and curling up.",
        "In addition, the arrangement provides a heat efficient image forming apparatus.",
        "To achieve the second objective, a heating method in accordance with the present invention is a method of heating a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where a first heating member and a second heating member meet, and is characterized in that the method involves the step of determining a heating nip transit time for any given point on the second heating member in rotation to pass through a heating nip region where the second heating member and the external heating member contact each other, based on a material and thermal capacity of an external heating member rotating with the second heating member in contact with the second heating member and heating the second heating member so that the second heating member has a predetermined surface temperature, power consumptions by the first heating member, the second heating member, and the external heating member, and a surface temperature of the external heating member.",
        "According to the method, the heating nip transit time can be determined in accordance with the material and thermal capacity of the external heating member so that, for example, the power consumption in the heater (first, second, and external heating members) while the heated material is passing through the press region is smaller than that in a heater without an external heating member and the surface temperature of the external heating member while the heated material is passing through the press region does not exceed a predetermined temperature (for example, heat resistance temperature).",
        "The method therefore heats the heated material on low power consumption by arranging the heater so as to achieve the determined heating nip transit time in this manner, although the external heating member is included.",

        "The core metal 231a forms the main body of the heat roller 231 and has a hollow cylindrical structure. The core metal 231a is preferably iron, aluminum, copper, or an alloy of these metals. Specifically, the metal 231a is, for example, stainless steel or carbon steel. Here, the core metal 231a is iron (STKM (carbon steel)) and has a diameter of 40 mm and a thickness of 0.4 mm to give it low thermal capacity.",

        "Slightly above the outer surface of the heat roller 231 in the downstream vicinity of the fix nip section Y is there provided a guide section 238 guiding the recording paper P with the fixed toner T off the heat roller 231.",
        "The pressure roller 232 is rotatable in the direction indicated by arrow B in the figure. The roller 232 is pressed to the heat roller 231 by a spring or other pressure member (not shown) with a force of, for example, 274 N. Thus, the fix nip section Y, about 7 mm wide, is formed between the pressure roller 232 and the heat roller 231. The pressure roller 232 is made up of a core metal 232a, a heat resistant elastic layer 232b, and a releasing layer 232c.",

        "Slightly above the outer surface of the heat roller 231 is there provided a temperature sensor (temperature sensing means or temperature sensing section) 237 sensing the surface temperature of the heat roller 231.

        "A cleaning roller 240 is provided upstream to the external heat roller 233 near the outer surface of the pressure roller 232.",

The cleaning roller 240 is disposed upstream to the heating nip section Z and presses the pressure roller 232 with a predetermined push force.",
        "Supported at the axis, the cleaning roller 240 is rotated by the rotation of the pressure roller 232. The cleaning roller 240 is a cylindrical core material made of aluminum, stainless steel, or a like metal. Here, the cleaning roller 240 is made of stainless steel.",

        "Now, the fixer 23 will be further described in terms of its operation. Still referring to FIG. 1, the recording paper P carrying an image formed by unfixed toner T is transported in the direction indicated by arrow C in the figure. The recording paper P is heated to a predetermined temperature by the external heat roller 233 and the heat roller 231 heated to 200\u00b0 C. by the heater lamps 234, 235. The paper P is then passed between the heat roller 231 and the pressure roller 232 which is being pressed by the roller 231, that is, through the fix nip section Y.",
        "While passing through the section Y, the unfixed toner T melts and firmly adheres onto the recording paper P under heat and pressure from the rollers 231, 232. Hence, the fixer 23 arranged as above is capable of fixing the toner T onto the recording paper P passing between the rollers 231, 232.",
        "The nip transit time in the present embodiment is preferably 23 milliseconds or less. The nip transit time is defined as a time taken for any given point on the recording paper P to pass through the fix nip section Y, that is, the width (mm) of the fix nip section Y divided by the transport speed (fixing rate) (mm/sec.) of the recording paper P. In other words, the fixer 23 is applicable to high speed apparatuses.",
        "A typical copying machine operates in copy mode, warm-up mode, standby mode, etc.",
        "Warm-up mode is the mode in which the copying machine operates immediately after its power supply is turned on. In that mode, the copying machine first feeds current to the heater lamps 234, 235 to heat up the heat roller 231 to a predetermined temperature (here, 200\u00b0 C.). As the heat roller 231 reaches the predetermined temperature, the machine turns on the drive motor, driving the rollers 231, 232, 233 to rotate at a peripheral speed (fixing rate) of 36.5 mm/sec. and simultaneously with the driving, feeds electric current to the heater lamp 239. The external heat roller 233 is continuously heated until it reaches a predetermined temperature (here, 170\u00b0 C.).",
        "In copy mode, the copying machine forms an image on the recording paper P moving at a predetermined speed. It is in this mode that the fixer 23 fixes toner onto the recording paper P. In copy mode, the electric current feeds to the heater lamps 234, 235, 239 are controlled so as to maintain the heat roller 231 and the pressure roller 232 at predetermined temperatures (here, 200\u00b0 C. and 135\u00b0 C. respectively).",
        "Specifically, the heater lamp 239 in the external heat roller 233 is so controlled as to maintain the external heat roller 233 at a temperature (here, 170\u00b0 C.) required to maintain the surface of the pressure roller 232 at a predetermined temperature (here, 135\u00b0 C.).",
        "In standby mode, electric consumption is maintained at such a level that the copying machine can enter copy mode immediately in response to a print request. After copying is finished, the copying machines is in standby mode for some time before entering low power mode.",
        "Fixing toner T onto the recording paper P requires some amount of surface pressure between the heat roller 231 and the pressure roller 232 in the fix nip section Y. In other words, some load needs to be applied to the recording paper P while transiting the fix nip section Y, to fix toner T.",
        "Next, referring to Table 1, relationship will be described between the load necessary to fix toner T (hereinafter, \u201crequired fixing load\u201d), the surface temperature, T1, of the heat roller 231, and the surface temperature, T2, of the pressure roller 232. The surface temperature, T1, of the heat roller 231 was 200\u00b0 C. Required surface pressure (kPa) is defined as the required fixing load (N) divided by the area of the fix nip section Y where toner T is fixed.",
        "In arrangements (I), (II), and (III) of the fixer 23, the surface temperature, T2, of the pressure roller 232 was respectively set to 105\u00b0 C., 130\u00b0 C., and 135\u00b0 C.",
        "In comparative examples (I), (II), there was provided no external heat roller 233 heating the pressure roller 232. In comparative example (III), a heater lamp heating the heat roller 231 was provided inside the pressure roller 232, replacing the external heat roller 233.",

        "In comparative examples (II), (III), and arrangement (I) to (III), the nip transit time was 19.2 milliseconds (ms) (the copy rate was 65 copies per minute if A4 recording paper. P was fed in landscape orientation), and the fix nip section Y was 7 mm wide (\u201cfix nip width\u201d as measured in the direction indicated by arrow A in the figure). In comparative example (I), the nip transit time was 17.8 milliseconds, and the fix nip width was 6.5 mm.",
        "Table 1 shows that a very high surface pressure (360 kPa or greater) is necessary in comparative examples (I), (II) where the pressure roller 232 is not heated.",
        "This is because the nip transit time is too short to transfer sufficient thermal energy from the heat roller 231 to the recording paper P for the toner to melt, despite the fact that the surface temperature, T1, of the heat roller 231 is controlled at the limit temperature, 200\u00b0 C. Another reason is the missing heat source (for example, the external heat roller 233, the heater lamp, or similar heating means) in the pressure roller 232: without the heat source, the surface temperature, T2, of the pressure roller 232 falls to or below 100\u00b0 C. (hence, T1-T2\u2267100\u00b0 C. (deg.)), where sufficient thermal energy is not transferred from the pressure roller 232 to the recording paper P; very high fixing load becomes necessary to compensate for the insufficient thermal energy transfer.",
        "On the other hand, by maintaining the surface temperature, T2, of the pressure roller 232 at a high value (hence, T1-T2\u2266100\u00b0 C. (deg.)) by means of the provision of the heating means (the external heat roller 233 or the heater lamp) heating the pressure roller 233 as in comparative example (III) and arrangements (I) to (III), an increased amount of thermal energy is transferred from the pressure roller 232 to the recording paper P. The required fixing load is therefore reduced-to or below 300 kPa.",
        "Now see FIG. 2 for a graphical representation of the relationship between the required surface pressure (kPa) and the difference, T1-T2 (\u00b0 C.), between the surface temperature, T1, of the heat roller 231 and the surface temperature, T2, of the pressure roller 232, all data taken from Table 1.",
        "As shown in the figure, approximating, by the least squares method, the relationship between the required surface pressure P (kPa) and the difference, T1-T2 (\u00b0 C.), in temperature between the heat roller 231 and pressure roller 232 based on comparative examples (I) to (III) and arrangements (I) to (III), we obtain T1-T2=30\u00d7ln(P)\u221272.5.",
        "As mentioned earlier, a smaller difference, T1-T2 (\u00b0 C.), in temperature between the heat roller 231 and the pressure roller 232 allows more thermal energy transfer from the pressure roller 232 to the recording paper P, and hence a less required fixing load. Taking these facts into account, it is preferred if the relationship between the required surface pressure P (kPa) and the difference, T1-T2 (\u00b0 C.), in temperature between the heat roller 231 and the pressure roller 232 is given by equation (1):\n\nT1\u2212T2\u226630\u00d7ln(P)\u221272.5 \u2003\u2003(1)",

        "As in the foregoing, the fixer 23 includes the mutually pressing heat roller 231 and pressure roller 232. The recording paper P is heated while transiting the fix nip section Y (press region) where the heat roller 231 and the pressure roller 232 meet. The toner T on the recording paper P is thereby fixed.",
        "The external heat roller 233 heats up the pressure roller 232 from the outside. The transit time in which any given point on the recording paper P can pass through the fix nip section Y is 2.3\u00d710\u22122 sec. So, the fixer 23 is applicable to high speed apparatuses. Here, \u201cT1-T2\u2266100 (\u00b0 C.)\u201d holds where T1 is the surface temperature of the heat roller 231 in degrees Celsius, and T2 is the surface temperature of the pressure roller 232 in degrees Celsius. It is preferable if T1-T2\u226670 (\u00b0 C.) holds.",
        "Employing one of the above arrangements, the surface pressure in the fix nip section Y does not need to be increased in high speed apparatuses. The load applied to the rollers 231, 232 can be reduced.",
        "Therefore, rollers, especially, the heat roller 231 can be reduced in thickness, hence in thermal capacity, which in turn reduces the warm-up time of the fixer 23. As a result, pre-heating of the fixer 23 becomes unnecessary. Power consumption in warm-up and standby is lowered.",
        "Further, the reduced load on the rollers 231, 232 prevents the rollers 231, 232 from creeping and extends the rollers' lifetime.",
        "The reduced thicknesses of the rollers 231, 232 allow for a more compact fixer 23. The reduced drive torques of the rollers 231, 232 allow for lower power consumption and extends lifetime of driver components.",
        "The difference between the surface temperature of the heat roller 231 and the surface temperature of the pressure roller 232 is controlled by the external heat roller 233.",
        "Specifically, the fixer 23 includes the temperature sensor 236 sensing the surface temperature of the external heat roller 233 and the control means (not shown) controlling the surface temperature of the external heat roller 233 based on the result of the sensing.",
        "Thus, the surface temperature of the heat roller 231 and the surface temperature of the pressure roller 232 are controllable using a simple arrangement.",
        "On the other hand, the surface temperature of the heat roller 231 is controlled at a substantially constant value.",
        "Thus, the difference between the surface temperature of the heat roller 231 and the surface temperature of the pressure roller 232 is controllable by the external heat roller 233 through the control of only the surface temperature of the pressure roller 232.",
        "It is preferred if the fixer 23 satisfies the equation:\n\nT1\u2212T2\u226630\u00d7ln(P)\u221272.5\n\nwhere P is a surface pressure (kPa) on the recording paper P in the fix nip section Y, T1 is the surface temperature (\u00b0 C.) of the heat roller 231, and T2 is the surface temperature (\u00b0 C.) of the pressure roller 232.",
        "Thus, T1-T2 can be reduced, and an increased quantity of heat can be transferred to the recording paper P. Therefore, the load on the pressure roller 232 can be reduced.",
        "Now, referring to Table 2, the warm-up time and energy consumption efficiency are compared among the aforementioned comparative example (III) and arrangements (I) to (III). In arrangements (I) to (III), the thickness of the core metal 231a of the heat roller 231 was determined for each required fixing load so that the heat roller 231 did not warp exceeding the allowable amount.",

        "Table 2 shows that in comparative example (III) where the pressure roller 232 is heated by the heater lamp from the inside (which is not the case in arrangements (I) to (III)), the warm-up time is 424 seconds, much longer than in arrangements (I) to (III).",
        "This is because it takes a very long time to heat the surface of the pressure roller 232 to a predetermined temperature (here, 130\u00b0 C.) due to the large thermal capacity of the pressure roller 232 and the poor heat conductance of the heat resistant elastic layer 232b made of silicone rubber.",
        "These results show that the pressure roller 232 is preferably heated externally using, for example, the external heat roller 233, rather than internally using, for example, the heater lamp.",
        "Table 2 and FIG. 3 demonstrate also that although arrangements (I) to (III) all employ an external heating approach, they do differ in energy consumption efficiency (power consumption per hour (Wh/h)): arrangements (II), (III) in which the pressure roller 232 is heated so that T1-T2\u226670 (\u00b0 C.) lowers the energy consumption efficiency further than arrangement (I).",
        "This is because when T1-T2\u226670 (\u00b0 C.), the warm-up time (time taken for the heat roller to reach a predetermined fixing temperature) can be reduced to 30 seconds or less, and therefore the OFF mode can be started in 15 minutes or less of the shift time (standby mode) to the low power mode. Here, the standby mode is supposed to last for 6 minutes.",
        "Now, move on to FIG. 4, a graphical representation of the relationship between the warm-up time (sec.) and the thermal capacity per unit length (J/m\u00b7\u00b0 C.) of the heat roller 231 in the axis direction for arrangements (I) to (III), all data taken from Table 2.",
        "The figure shows that to make the warm-up time 30 seconds or less, the thermal capacity per unit length of the heat roller 231 in the axis direction should be 200 (J/m\u00b7\u00b0 C.) or less.",
        "Incidentally, as mentioned earlier, a sufficient quantity of heat may not be transferred in some cases from the pressure roller 232 to the recording paper P, causing defects in the fixing of toner T. This can happen when, for example, the pressure roller 232 is made of a material with extremely poor heat conductivity even if the surface temperature, T2, of the pressure roller 232 is maintained at a high temperature state (hence, T1-T2\u2266100 (\u00b0 C.) or T1-T2\u226670 (\u00b0 C.)).",

        "As mentioned earlier, a larger Q2/(Q1+Q2) results in a greater amount of thermal energy being transferred from the pressure roller 232 to the recording paper P, and allows for a reduced required fixing load. Taking these facts into account, it is preferred if the relationship between the required surface pressure P (kPa) and the ratio, Q2/(Q1+Q2), of the heat quantity Q2 to the total heat quantity Q1+Q2 is given by equation (2):\n\nQ2/(Q1+Q2)\u2267\u22120.078\u00d7ln(P)+0.7 \u2003\u2003(2)",

        "As shown in FIGS. 17 to 19, a longer heating nip transit time, hence a greater width of the heating nip section Z, improves fixing of toner T even at low external heat roller temperatures. On the other hand, a longer heating nip transit time results in a greater power consumption during paper transit. Reasons will be examined in the following.",
        "To increase the width of the heating nip section Z, the diameter of the external heat roller needs to be increased. Here, as shown in Table 5, the external heat rollers are varied only in thickness, disregarding their diameters, to give them equal thermal capacity. While all the rollers do have an equal thermal capacity (34.4 J/\u00b0 C.), a greater diameter of the external heat roller gives the roller a greater surface area, which results in increased thermal radiation and convection, and hence heat loss from the rollers. The increase in heat loss presumably exceeds the reduction in heat consumption realized by the lowered surface temperature of the external heat roller. The result is an increased total power consumption.",
        "FIGS. 17 to 19 also show as a comparative example the relationship, in for a fixer having no external heat roller, between the heating nip transit time and the power consumption during paper transit under the conditions. The fixer for the comparative example is identical in structure to the fixer 23 shown in FIG. 1, except that the external heat roller 233 is removed.",
        "The structure of the comparative example fixer is shown in FIG. 20. Specifically, the comparative example fixer 53 includes a heat roller 531, a pressure roller 532, a cleaning roller 540, heater lamps 534, 535, a temperature sensor 537, and a guide section 538.",

        "The following description will focus on the distinctions of the fixer 53 over the fixer 23. Description on common features will be omitted.",
        "As with the core metal 231a of the heat roller 231, the core metal 531a of the heat roller 531 in the fixer 53 is carbon steel (STKM). The core metal 531a however measures 55 mm in diameter and 1.3 mm in thickness. The heater lamps 534, 535 have a combined power rating of 1200 W.",
        "As with the core metal 232a of the pressure roller 232, the core metal 532a of the pressure roller 532 in the fixer 53 is stainless steel. The core metal 532a however measures 43 mm in diameter.",
        "The pressure roller 532 is pressed to the heat roller 531 by a spring or other pressure member (not shown) with a force of 980 N (100 kgf). Thus, a fix nip section Y\u2032, about 8 mm wide, is formed between the heat roller 531 and the pressure roller 532.",
        "Consequently, in the fixer 23, the rollers 231, 232 measure about 40 mm in diameter; the load necessary to fix toner T onto recording paper P (hereinafter, \u201crequired fixing load\u201d), that is, the pressure of the pressure roller 232 to the heat roller 233 is 745N; and the fix nip section Y is 6 mm wide. In contrast, in the fixer 53, the roller 531, 532 measure about 55 mm in diameter; the required fixing load is 980 N; and the fix nip section Y\u2032 is 8 mm wide.",
        "As discussed in the foregoing, the roller diameter, fixing load, fix nip section width are specified to greater values in the fixer 53 than in the fixer 23, because the fixer 53, including no external heat roller, inevitably requires a greater fixing load, fix nip section width, etc. to achieve equivalent fixing performance at the same fixing rate (recording paper transit speed) as in the fixer 23.",
        "The heating nip transit time t (ms) is preferably determined to meet two conditions: (a) The power consumption during paper transit is less than or equal to the power consumption during paper transit of the fixer 53 with a conventional structure. (b) The surface temperature of the external heat roller is 200\u00b0 C. or lower.",
        "In condition (b), the surface temperature of the external heat roller is 200\u00b0 C. or lower. This is because an examination of the aforementioned heat resistance of the external heat roller revealed that the heat resistance temperature (upper limit value) was about 200\u00b0 C.",

        "As mentioned earlier, the upper limit value t2 of the heating nip transit time is substantially constant at 9.15 or less without regard to the fixing rate V (mm/sec.).",

        "As in the foregoing, the fixer 23 includes the heat roller 231 and the pressure roller 232 pressing each other and heats up the recording paper P by passing the recording paper P through the fix nip section Y. The external heat roller 233, in contact with the pressure roller 232 to rotate with the pressure roller 232, heats the pressure roller 232 so that the surface of the pressure roller 232 reaches a predetermined temperature (for example, the limit for the heat resistance temperature).",
        "The heating nip transit time required for any given point on the rotating pressure roller 232 to pass through the heating nip section Z is decided on the basis of the material and thermal capacity of the external heat roller 233, the power consumption by the fixer 23 (heat roller 231, pressure roller 232, and external heat roller 233) during the transit of the recording paper P, and the surface temperature of the external heat roller 233 during the transit of the recording paper P.",
        "In other words, the fixer 23 is arranged to meet equation (3) or (4) in the case of an aluminum external heat roller 233 (core metal 233a). When this is the case, the external heat roller 233 has a thermal capacity of 34.4 J/\u00b0 C.",
        "Thus, the heating nip transit time can be determined in accordance with the material and thermal capacity of the external heat roller 233 so that, for example, the heater's power consumption during the transit of the recording paper P is smaller that in the comparative example with no external heat roller 233 or the surface temperature of the external heat roller 233 during the transit of the recording paper P does not exceed a predetermined temperature (for example, heat resistance temperature (here, 200\u00b0 C.)).",
        "Therefore, power consumption can be lowered although the external heat roller 233 is included.",
        "The following will examine an external heat roller (equivalent to the external heat roller 233) with a carbon steel (steel) core metal (equivalent to the core metal 233a shown in FIG. 1).

        "As in the foregoing, the fixer 23 is arranged to meet equation (5) or (6) in the case of a carbon steel external heat roller 233 (core metal 233a). When this is the case, the external heat roller 233 has a thermal capacity of 34.4 J/\u00b0 C.",
        "Thus, the heating nip transit time can be determined in accordance with the material and thermal capacity of the external heat roller 233 so that, for example, the heater's power consumption during the transit of the recording paper P is smaller than in the comparative example with no external heat roller 233 or the surface temperature of the external heat roller during the transit of the recording paper P does not exceed a predetermined temperature (for example, heat resistance temperature (here, 200\u00b0 C.)).",
        "Therefore, power consumption can be lowered although the external heat roller 233 is included.",
        "The external heat roller 233 may be made of any given material, but preferably of carbon steel or stainless steel with a high Young modulus. These materials improve the mechanical strength of the external heat roller 233.",
        "The foregoing description took the fixer (heater) 23 as an example of a device including the rollers 231, 232, 233. The embodiment is not limited to this, and may be preferably applied to, for example, a dryer device in the wet electrophotographic image forming apparatus, a dryer device in the inkjet printer, and an eraser device for the rewriteable medium.",

        "FIG. 28 shows the structure of a major part of the fixer (heater) 23 in accordance with the present embodiment. As shown in the figure, the fixer 23 includes in covers 230a, 230b a heat roller (first heating member) 231, a pressure roller (second heating member) 232, and an external heat roller 233.",
        "The following will describe an example of the fixer 23 applied to an electrophotographic copying machine. The fixer 23 fixes toner T to recording paper P by applying heat and pressure the recording paper P carrying an image formed by unfixed toner T.",
        "As shown in FIG. 28, the heat roller 231 is rotatable in the direction indicated by arrow C1 in the figure. The roller 231 is provided to heat the recording paper P while transiting a fix nip section Y where the heat roller 231 and the pressure roller 232 (detailed later) touch the recording paper P to fix the toner T onto the recording paper P. See a later description for details about the section. The heat roller 231 is made up of a cylindrical core metal 231a and a releasing layer 231b.",
        "The pressure roller 232 is rotatable in the direction indicated by arrow D1 in the figure. The core metal 233a is an aluminum cylinder shaft measuring 15 mm in diameter and 1.0 mm in thickness.",
        "Now, the fixer 23 will be described in terms of its operation. Still referring to FIG. 28, the recording paper P carrying an image formed by unfixed toner T is transported in the direction indicated by arrow E1 in the figure. The recording paper P is heated by the external heat roller 233 heated to a predetermined temperature and the heat roller 231 heated to 200\u00b0 C. by the heater lamps 234, 235. The paper P is then passed between the heat roller 231 and the pressure roller 232 which is being pressed by the roller 231, that is, through the fix nip section Y.",
        "While passing through the section Y, the unfixed toner T melts and firmly adheres onto the recording paper P under heat and pressure from the rollers 231, 232. Hence, the fixer 23 arranged as above is capable of fixing the toner T onto the recording paper P passing between the rollers 231, 232.",
        "A typical copying machine operates in copy mode, warm-up mode, standby mode, etc.",
        "warm-up mode is the mode in which the copying machine operates immediately after its power supply is turned on. In that mode, the copying machine first feeds current to the heater lamps 234, 235 to heat up the heat roller 231 to a predetermined temperature (here, 200\u00b0 C.). As the heat roller 231 reaches the predetermined temperature, the machine turns on the drive motor, driving the rollers 231, 232, 233 to rotate at a peripheral speed (fixing rate) of 365 mm/sec. and simultaneously with the driving, feeds electric current to the heater lamp 239. The external heat roller 233 is continuously heated until it reaches a predetermined temperature (here, 190\u00b0 C. (at which time the pressure roller 232 reaches 150\u00b0 C.)).",
        "In copy mode, the copying machine forms an image on the recording paper P moving at a predetermined speed. It is in this mode that the fixer 23 fixes toner onto the recording paper P. In copy mode, the electric current feeds to the heater lamps 234, 235, 239 are controlled so as to maintain the heat roller 231 and the pressure roller 232 at predetermined temperatures (here, for example, 200\u00b0 C. and 136\u00b0 C. respectively).",
        "Specifically, the heater lamp 239 in the external heat roller 233 is so controlled as to maintain the external heat roller 233 at a temperature (170\u00b0 C.) required to maintain the surface temperature of the pressure roller 232 at a predetermined temperature (136\u00b0 C.).",
        "In copy mode, if the recording paper P is A4 in landscape orientation, 65 sheets per minute of the recording paper P are fed to the fix nip section Y. Under these conditions, the nip transit time (time taken for any given point on the recording paper P to pass through the fix nip section Y) is 19.2 milliseconds.",
        "In standby mode, electric consumption is maintained at such a level that the copying machine can enter copy mode immediately in response to a print request. After copying is finished, the copying machine is in standby mode for some time before entering low power mode.",
        "The thermal energy dissipated in the form of radiation from the fixer 23 varies depending on the place of the fixer 23, the transport direction of the recording paper P, and the positional relationship between the pressure roller 232 and the external heat roller 233.",
        "The following will examine the layout in the fixer 23, the transport direction of the recording paper P, and the positional relationship between the pressure roller 232 and the external heat roller 233 so as to reduce the thermal energy dissipated in the form of radiation (radiation energy) from the fixer 23.",
        "The fixer 23 is placed so that the recording paper P is transported vertically upward in the fixer 23 (the paper transit direction is the direction indicated by arrow E1 in the figure) (arrangement (V)).",
        "In comparative example (IV), arrangement (VI), and arrangement (VII), all as comparative examples, the fixer differs from arrangement (V) in accordance with the present embodiment in the layout in the fixer, the transport direction of the recording paper P, and the positional relationship between the pressure roller 232 and the external heat roller 233.

        "As viewed in a cross section, showing the external heat roller 233, vertical to the center of rotation (rotation axis) of the pressure roller 232, region B (second region) is a part of the surface of the pressure roller 232 stretching from the recording-paper-P-ejecting end of the fix nip section Y to the heating position of the external heat roller 233 in the rotational direction of the pressure roller 232. Similarly, region A (first region) is another part of the surface of the pressure roller 232 stretching from the heating position of the external heat roller 233 to the recording-paper-P-loading end of the fix nip section Y.",
        "The angles (\u03b8p) in the description below is measured counterclockwise off a line (dash-dot line H in the figure (facing the right hand side)) vertical to a normal to the plane on which is installed the copying machine incorporating the fixer 23 (substantially parallel to the ground), the line H present on a plane parallel to that plane. For example, as shown in FIG. 28, in arrangement (V), the paper transit direction is vertical upward (its angle is 90\u00b0), and the external heat roller 233 is positioned at 225\u00b0 on the pressure roller 232. In other words, the line linking the center of the pressure roller 232 to the center of the external heat roller 233 is 225\u00b0 off line H, with the external heat roller 233 disposed lower than the pressure roller 232 in terms of the rollers' centers.",
        "As shown in FIG. 28, region A is located lower than region B in arrangement (V) in terms of the widthwise center lines of regions A, B. In other words, as shown in Table 10, region A faces downward, and region B upward.",
        "The area Sa of region A is 1.40\u00d7104 (mm2), whilst the area Sb of region B is 2.34\u00d7104 (mm2). The temperature of region A is 136\u00b0 C., whilst the temperature of region B is 119\u00b0 C.",
        "In arrangement (V), the radiation energy from the fixer is 238 W.",
        "As shown in Table 10 and FIG. 30, comparative example (IV) differs from arrangement (V) in that the fixer is rotated 90\u00b0 counterclockwise. That is, in comparative example (IV), the paper transit direction is horizontal (in the direction indicated by E2 in FIG. 30; the angle is 0\u00b0), and the external heat roller 233 is positioned at 315\u00b0 on the pressure roller 232 (lower than the pressure roller 232).",
        "In comparative example (IV), the area Sa of region A, the area Sb of region B, the temperature of region A, and the temperature of region B are identical to those in arrangement (V). In comparative example (IV), the radiation energy from the fixer is 259 W.",
        "Setting the paper transit direction to the vertical upward direction as in arrangement (V) as discussed in the foregoing improves heat efficiency by reducing radiation energy by about 9.1% compared to setting the paper transit direction to the horizontal direction as in comparative example (IV).",
        "This is because of reduction in heat dissipation by convection from region A. Where the temperature of region A is Tpa, and the temperature of region B is Tpb, Tpa>Tpb holds because region B is yet to be heated by the external heat roller 233, and region A has been already heated by the external heat roller 233. Therefore, region A is likely to lose heat to the air by radiation compared to region B. In addition, in the case of arrangement (V), region A faces downward, resulting in less heat dissipation from region A by convection. The total heat dissipation from the pressure roller 232 is therefore less than in comparative example (IV).",
        "In arrangement (V), the recording paper P is moved (transported) in a substantially vertical direction. This makes a part of the surface of the heat roller 231 face downward. The downward region (part) dissipates less heat by convection. Still in the case of arrangement (V), part of the air heated by the heat roller 231 flows toward the pressure roller 232, heating the pressure roller 232. This improves the heat efficiency of the fixer.",
        "Still in the case of arrangement (V), the paper transit direction of the recording paper P is substantially vertical. The space in the fixer 23 is therefore divided into an upper half (hereinafter, \u201cupper space\u201d) and a lower half (hereinafter, \u201clower space\u201d) by the heat roller 231 and the pressure roller 232. Since region A of the surface of the pressure roller 232 and the external heat roller 233 are in the lower space, the air in the lower space is heated to a higher temperature than the air in the upper space. The air heated to this higher temperature hardly flows out of the fixer 23 and remains inside the lower space, improving the heat efficiency of the fixer 23.",
        "Now, referring to FIG. 31 and Table 10, arrangement (VI) will be described as an example where the external heat roller 233 is in a different position from arrangement (V).",
        "As shown in FIG. 31, in arrangement (VI), the external heat roller 233 is positioned at 135\u00b0 on the pressure roller 232 (higher than the pressure roller 232).",
        "Again in arrangement (VI), the area Sa of region A is 2.34\u00d7104 (mm2), and the area Sb of region B is 1.40\u00d7104 (mm2). The temperature of region A is 136\u00b0 C., and the temperature of region B is 119\u00b0 C. In the case of arrangement (VI), the radiation energy from the fixer 23 is 251 W.",
        "Similarly to arrangement (V), the paper transit direction in arrangement (VI) is vertical; therefore, the radiation energy is smaller than in comparative example (IV).",
        "Arrangement (V) improves heat efficiency by reducing radiation energy by about 5.2% compared to arrangement (VI).",
        "This is because region A in arrangement (V) is smaller in terms of area, and hence dissipates less heat by convection, than region A in arrangement (VI).",
        "Another reason is that the external heat roller 233 is present in the lower space in arrangement (V), which makes it difficult for the air heated by the external heat roller 233 to flow out of the fixer 23.",
        "Referring to FIG. 32 and Table 10, arrangement (VII) will be described as an example where the paper transit direction for the recording paper P differs from that in arrangement (VI).",
        "As shown in FIG. 32, the paper transit direction in arrangement (VII) is vertically downward (in the direction indicated by arrow E3 in the figure; the angle is 270\u00b0). This is different from arrangements (V), (VI). Therefore, region A is located higher than region B. This is different from arrangements (V), (VI).",
        "In arrangement (VII), the area Sa of region A is 1.40\u00d7104 (mm2), and the area Sb of region B is 2.34\u00d7104 (mm2). The temperature of region A is 136\u00b0 C., and the temperature of region B is 119\u00b0 C. In the case of arrangement (VII), the radiation energy from the fixer 23 is 256 W.",
        "Similarly to arrangement (V), the paper transit direction in arrangement (VII) is again vertical; therefore, the radiation energy is smaller than in comparative example (IV).",
        "Arrangement (V) improves heat efficiency by reducing the radiation energy by about 7.0% compared to arrangement (VII).",
        "This is because region A in arrangement (VII) faces upward and dissipates more heat by convection than region A in arrangement (V). The total heat dissipation from the pressure roller 232 is therefore more than in arrangement (V).",
        "Another reason is that in arrangement (VII) the paper transit direction is upward; therefore, the heat roller 231 and the pressure roller 232 rotate upward where they face the cover 230a and the cover 230b respectively, exerting such a force to generate an upward flow of air in their vicinity.",
        "This helps the air in the lower space heated by the heat roller 231, pressure roller 232, and external heat roller 233 move into the upper space and flow out of the fixer 23 through, for example, a paper ejection opening on the fixer 23. On the other hand, if the paper transit direction is upward as in arrangement (V), the heat roller 231 and the pressure roller 232 rotate downward where they face the cover 230a and the cover 230b respectively, exerting such a force to generate an downward flow of air in their vicinity. This helps the air in the lower space heated by the heat roller 231, pressure roller 232, and external heat roller 233 remain in the lower space.",
        "As detailed in the foregoing, the arrangement where the paper transit direction is vertically upward and the external heat roller 233 is provided such that region A faces downward and is smaller (i.e., shorter in length) than region B (arrangement (V)) achieves the greatest reduction in radiation energy. Somewhat less significant, nevertheless similarly meaningful, reduction in radiation energy is achieved by arranging one of the paper transit direction, the placement (region A, B) of the external heat roller 233, etc. similarly to arrangement (V) (arrangements (VI), (VII)).",
        "A cleaning roller 240 may be provided near the surface of the pressure roller 232. An arrangement incorporating such a cleaning roller 240 will be now described.",
        "The following will examine the relationship between the radiation energy from the fixer 23 and the placement of the cleaning roller 240.",
        "The cleaning roller 240 is supported at its axis so that it is rotated by the rotation of the pressure roller 232. The cleaning roller 240 is a core material made of aluminum or a like metal and has a cylindrical shape. Here, the cleaning roller 240 is made of stainless steel.",
        "Arrangement (VIII) is identical to aforementioned arrangement (V), except the cleaning roller 240 provided upstream to the external heat roller 233. In arrangement (VIII), the cleaning roller 240 is positioned at 135\u00b0 on the pressure roller 232.",
        "In comparative examples (V), (VI), the position of the cleaning roller 240 differs from arrangement (VIII). Comparative examples (V), (VI) were compared to arrangement (VIII) (FIG. 29) regarding radiation energy.",
        "Table 11 shows the arrangement (paper transit direction, positional relationship (contact position of the external heat roller 233) between the external heat roller 233 and the pressure roller 232, orientation, area Sa, and temperature of region A, and orientation, area Sb, and temperature of region B), the position of the cleaning roller 240 (positional relationship with the external heat roller 233), and the radiation energy of comparative examples (V), (VI) and arrangement (VIII).",

        "As shown in Table 11 and FIG. 34, in comparative example (V), the cleaning roller 240 is positioned upstream to the external heat roller 233, at 90\u00b0 on the pressure roller 232. The radiation energy in comparative example (V) is 252 W.",
        "As shown in FIG. 33, the cleaning roller 240 in comparative example (V) is positioned downstream to the external heat roller 233, at 270\u00b0 on the pressure roller 232. The radiation energy in comparative example (VI) is 256 W.",
        "The radiation energy in arrangement (VIII) is 245 W.",
        "As discussed in the foregoing, arrangement (VIII) improves heat efficiency by reducing radiation energy by about 4.3% compared to comparative example (VI).",
        "This is because the cleaning roller 240 is positioned above the external heat roller 233 in arrangement (VIII). This is different from comparative example (VI). The cleaning roller 240 in arrangement (VIII) is capable of preventing the air heated by the external heat roller 233 from flowing out of the fixer 23 through a paper ejection opening on the fixer 23.",
        "When in contact with the pressure roller 232, the cleaning roller 240 in typical situations acts as a thermal load and adversely affects the external heat roller 233's function of heating the pressure roller 232. Comparative example (VI) is susceptible to the negative effects of the cleaning roller 240 positioned downstream to the external heat roller 233. Arrangement (VIII), however, is less affected by the cleaning roller 240 acting as a thermal load, because the air heated by the external heat roller 233 (thermal radiation) heats the cleaning roller 240 in advance.",
        "Arrangement (VIII) improves heat efficiency by reducing the radiation energy by about 2.8% compared to comparative example (V).",
        "In comparative example (V), as seen from the external heat roller 233, the entire cleaning roller 240 is hidden behind the pressure roller 232. The thermal radiation from the external heat roller 233 does not reach the cleaning roller 240. In contrast, in arrangement (VIII), the external heat roller 233 and the cleaning roller 240 are disposed almost to face each other, so as not to be obstructed by the pressure roller 232. In other words, the external heat roller 233 and the cleaning roller 240 are positioned to face each other around the pressure roller 232.",
        "Therefore, in arrangement (VIII), the cleaning roller 240 absorbs part of the thermal radiation from the external heat roller 233, reducing the heat loss from the external heat roller 233.",
        "The arrangement (for example, material, dimensions, shape, etc.) of the heat roller 231, pressure roller 232, external heat roller 233, and cleaning roller 240 is by no means limited to the aforementioned arrangement in any special manner.",
        "The foregoing description took the fixer (heater) 23 as an example of a device including the rollers 231, 232, 233. The embodiment is not limited to this, and may be preferably applied to, for example, a dryer device in the wet electrophotographic image forming apparatus, a dryer device in the inkjet printer, and an eraser device for the rewriteable medium.",

The core metal 232a is aluminum, iron, stainless steel, or a like metal. The heat resistant elastic layer 232b is made of a 6-mm thick silicone rubber foam.",
        "Table 12 shows comparison in the radiation energy from the fixer 23 between arrangement (IX) and arrangement (V).

        "As shown in Table 12, the radiation energy in arrangement (V) is 238 W, whilst the radiation energy in arrangement (IX) is 206 W. Arrangement (IX) in accordance with the present embodiment improves heat efficiency by reducing the radiation energy by about 13.4% compared to arrangement (V).",
        "This is because the heat roller method entails heat loss (about 47 W) from the surface of the external heat roller 233 through thermal radiation and convection, whereas the induction heating method allows the pressure roller 232 to directly heat up and causes the induction heating coil 241 itself to hardly heat up, let alone make heat loss.",
        "Aforementioned embodiments 1, 2 assumed that the paper transit direction was preferably vertical.

In other words, the arrangement allows for a smaller load being applied to the heating members.",
        "This allows for construction of thinner and smaller thermal capacity heating members, and hence reduces the warm-up time of the heater. Therefore, pre-heating of the heating members becomes unnecessary. Power consumption in warm-up and standby is lowered.",
        "The less load on the heating members, for example, prevents the heating members from creeping and extends the heating members' lifetime.",

        "A heating method in accordance with the present invention, as described in the foregoing, is a method of heating a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where a first heating member and a second heating member meet, and is arranged so that the method involves the step of determining a heating nip transit time for any given point on the second heating member in rotation to pass through a heating nip region where the second heating member and the external heating member contact each other, based on a material and thermal capacity of an external heating member rotating with the second heating member in contact with the second heating member and heating the second heating member so that the second heating member has a predetermined surface temperature, power consumptions by the first heating member, the second heating member, and the external heating member, and a surface temperature of the external heating member.",
        "According to the method, the heating nip transit time can be determined in accordance with the material and thermal capacity of the external heating member so that, for example, the power consumption in the heater (first, second, and external heating members) while the heated material is passing through the press region is smaller than that in a heater without an external heating member and the surface temperature of the external heating member while the heated material is passing through the press region does not exceed a predetermined temperature (for example, heat resistance temperature).",
        "The method therefore heats the heated material on low power consumption by arranging the heater so as to achieve the determined heating nip transit time in this manner, although the external heating member is included.",
        "It is preferred if the heating method is such that when, for example, the external heating member is made of aluminum, the heating nip transit time t (ms) satisfies 0.0005V2\u22120.283V+43.9\u2266t\u22669.15 where V (mm/sec.) is a transit speed at which the heated material passes through the press region.",
        "Alternatively, it is preferred if the heating method is such that when the heated material is a A4 sheet and passes through the press region so that a 210-mm long side of the heated material is parallel to a transit direction, the heating nip transit time t (ms) satisfies 0.0128 P2\u22121.36 P+35.2\u2266t\u22669.15 where P (copies per minute) is a transit speed at which the heated material passes through the press region.",
        "The method heats the heated material on low power consumption by specifying a range for the heating nip transit time t in accordance with the material (aluminum) of the external heating member, although the external heating member is included.",
        "It is preferred if the heating method is such that when the external heating member is made of steel, the heating nip transit time t (ms) satisfies 0.0005V2\u22120.351V+56.2\u2266t\u226613.10 where V (mm/sec.) is a transit speed at which the heated material passes through the press region.",
        "Alternatively, it is preferred if the heating method is such that when the heated material is a A4 sheet and passes through the press region so that a 210-mm long side of the heated material is parallel to a transit direction, the heating nip transit time t (ms) satisfies 0.0175 P2\u22121.96 P+54.8\u2266t\u226613.10 where P (copies per minute) is a transit speed at which the heated material passes through the press region.",
        "The method heats the heated material on low power consumption by specifying a range for the heating nip transit time t in accordance with the material (steel) of the external heating member, although the external heating member is included.",
        "A heater in accordance with the present invention, as described in the foregoing, includes a first heating member and a second heating member pressing each other, heats a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where the first heating member and the second heating member meet, and is arranged so that the heater comprises an external heating member heating the second heating member so that the second heating member has a predetermined surface temperature, wherein the heated material passes through the press region between the first heating member and the second heating member either upward or downward.",
        "According to the arrangement, the direction in which the heated material passes through the press region (transport direction for the heated material) is substantially vertical. A region is therefore downward with respect to the first and second heating members. This lowers heat dissipation by convection from the first and second heating members.",
        "The air heated in the heater remain in the lower space than the first and second heating members, heating the second heating member. The heat efficiency of the heater is improved.",
        "It is preferred if the heater the heated material passes through the press region in a substantially vertically upward direction.",
        "According to the arrangement, for example, the heating members, where they face the cover housing the heater, rotate downward, exerting such a force to generate a downward flow of air in their vicinity. This helps the air in the heater heated by the first, second, and external heating members readily remain in the lower space.",
        "It is preferred if the heater the first heating member and the second heating member pass the heated material by rotation; and most of a first region is positioned lower than a center of rotation of the second heating member, the first region being, in a cross-section, showing the external heating member, vertical to a center of rotation of the second heating member, a part of a surface of the second heating member stretching from a heating position of the external heating member to a heated material loading end of the press region in a rotational direction of the second heating member.",
        "In typical situations, the second region is yet to be heated by the external heating member, whilst the first region is already heated by the external heating member; the temperature of the first region is therefore higher than the temperature of the second region. Therefore, the first region is likely to lose heat to the air by radiation compared to the second region.",
        "However, according to the arrangement, most of the first region is positioned lower than center of rotation of the second heating member, and most of the first region faces downward. This reduces heat dissipation from the first region by convection. Therefore, the heater reduces radiation energy and improves heat efficiency.",
        "It is preferred if the heater is such that a second region is wider than the first region, the second region being, in the cross-section, a part of the surface of the second heating member stretching from a heated material ejecting end of the press region to the heating position of the external heating member in the rotational direction of the second heating member.",
        "The arrangement further reduces heat dissipation from the first region by convection. Therefore, the heater reduces radiation energy and improves heat efficiency.",
        "It is preferred if the heater is such that the first heating member and the second heating member pass the heated material by rotation; and a center of a first region is positioned lower than a center of a second region, the first region being, in a cross-section, showing the external heating member, vertical to a center of rotation of the second heating member, a part of a surface of the second heating member stretching from a heating position of the external heating member to a heated material loading end of the press region in a rotational direction of the second heating member, the second region being, in the cross-section, a part of the surface of the second heating member stretching from a heated material ejecting end of the press region to a heating position of the external heating member.",
        "According to the arrangement, the heated material is transported in a substantially vertically upward direction. Therefore, the air heated by the first, second, and external heating members readily remains in the lower space in the heater. This improves heat efficiency.",
        "It is preferred if the heater is such that the external heating member is a roller rotating with the second heating member in contact with the second heating member.",
        "According to the arrangement, the second heating member is heated using a simple structure occupying less space. This facilitates the mounting of a cleaning roller and other components.",
        "It is preferred if the heater is such that a center of rotation of the external heating member is positioned lower than a center of rotation of the second heating member.",
        "Typically, the air heated by the external heating member can readily flow out of the device through a heated material ejection opening.",
        "However, according to the arrangement, the heated material ejection opening is located far from the external heating member in the heater. The structure better retains the heated air inside the heater. Heat efficiency is thus improved.",
        "It is preferred if the heater is such that the second heating member includes a member heated by induction heating, and the external heating member is an induction heating coil heating the second heating member by induction.",
        "The arrangement enables the second heating member to directly heat up; there is little thermal radiation or convection heat loss from the surface of the second heating member. The external heating member hardly heats up, let alone make heat loss. This further improves heat efficiency.",
        "It is preferred if the heater is such that the external heating member is shaped to have a curvature.",
        "The arrangement develops a concentration of magnetic flux inside the induction heating coil as the external heating member and hence increases the magnitude of eddy current. This helps the second heating member heat up quickly.",
        "It is preferred if the heater is such that the first heating member and the second heating member pass the heated material by rotation; and the heater includes a cleaning member cleaning the surface of the second heating member, the cleaning member located upstream to the external heating member in the rotational direction of the second heating member.",
        "It is preferred if the heater is such that the cleaning member is made of a metal.",
        "According to the arrangement, the cleaning member is positioned above the external heating member. The cleaning member prevents the air heated by the external heating member from flowing out of the device through a heated material ejection opening on the heater. Heat efficiency thus improved.",
        "In addition, the air heated by the external heating member pre-heats the cleaning member. The cleaning member therefore does not act as a thermal load. The provision of the cleaning member does not hamper the external heating member's function of heating the second heating member.",
        "It is preferred if the heater is such that the cleaning member and the external heating member are positioned to face each other.",
        "According to the arrangement, the thermal radiation heat from the external heating member is partly absorbed by the cleaning member, which reduces heat loss from the external heating member.",
        "It is preferred if the heater fixes toner on the heated material by passing the heated material through the press region.",
        "According to the arrangement, the heater is applicable as a fixer, providing a high heat efficiency fixer.",
        "An image forming apparatus in accordance with the present invention is arranged so that it includes: an image transfer device forming an image of an unfixed toner on the heated material; and the heater described above fixing the unfixed toner on the heated material.",
        "The arrangement provides a high heat efficiency image forming apparatus.",
        "The embodiments and examples described in DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS are for illustrative purposes only and by no means limit the scope of the present invention. Variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the claims below."
