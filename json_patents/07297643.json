        "This application is a Divisional of U.S. Ser. No. 10/044,414, filed on Oct. 22, 2001 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,936,076 by Cates et al., and entitled \u201cTextile Substrate Having Coating Containing Multiphase Fluorochemical, Cationic Material, And Sorbant Polymer Thereon, For Image Printing\u201d. Priority is hereby claimed to such application, and its contents are incorporated herein in its entirety by specific reference thereto.",
        "The present invention generally relates to placing images on textiles, and in particular, to the treatment of textiles for enhancing the definition of the image placed upon the textile.",
        "Images are placed upon a substrate by various methods such as digital printing. Digital printing is the process of placing various small predetermined quantities of a colorant, known as pixels, in predetermined matrix zones of a substrate. Colorants can include dyes, pigments, polymeric colorants, or combinations thereof. Additionally, colorants can include different types and colors of dyes and/or pigments. The pixels can be placed on the substrate by various methods, such as ink jet printing. Typically, digital printing uses a limited small number of different colorants, and only one of these colorants is used for a particular pixel. Variations in colors and shades in digital printing is generally accomplished in digital printing by positioning different colored pixels in adjacent or near-by matrix zones. Although the actual color of the individual pixels is not changed, the impression to a viewer is that the area containing the different colored pixels is a color or shade that is different than any of the actual pixels in the associated area. The impression is created because the pixels are of such a small nature that the viewer cannot readily perceive the individual pixels, and perceives more of an average of the pixels.",
        "Placing images on textiles presents various difficulties not experienced in all substrates. It has been discovered by the inventors of the present invention that, due to the nature of the material in a textile, or the construction of the textile, the color medium (such as ink) used to place the image on the textile may not fill the intended zone for the medium, may bleed outside of the intended zone, or may be absorbed into the textile substrate. If the color medium does not fill the intended zone, the image placed on the textile can lose color intensity due to the presence of the underlying textile substrate color. If the color medium is absorbed into the textile, color intensity can be lost due to at least a portion of the color medium being disposed in an area of the textile that cannot be seen, and/or by the color medium failing to fill the intended zone. If the color medium bleeds outside of the intended zone, image acuity and intensity can be impacted.",
        "These problems are of greater concern with digital printing, where the intended zones for the color medium are smaller and closer together. Furthermore, methods to correct these problems can increase the ability of the textile substrate to lose colorant due to rubbing contact with another surface. Therefore, there is a need for textiles, textile treatments, and methods which reduce the difficulties in placing an image on textiles.",
        "FIG. 1 is a plot of the intensity value versus edge definition for various Examples of the present invention.",
        "In the present invention, a coating having cationic and repellant characteristics is coated onto the surface of a textile to receive a colorant image by processes such as digital printing. In one version of the present invention, the coating generally comprises a combination of a repellant finish chemical, a cationic material, and a sorbant polymer. In another version of the present invention, the coating generally comprises a multiphase fluorochemical, such as a \u201cdual action\u201d fluorochemical, and the cationic material. The version of the present invention having a multiphase fluorchemical can also include the sorbant polymer. In yet another version of the present invention, the coating generally comprises the cationic material and the sorbant polymer, wherein the cationic material comprises organic cationic materials that include at least two or more carbon atoms. The version of the present invention having organic cationic materials with two or more carbon atoms can also include the repellant finish chemical. The version of the present invention having organic cationic materials with two or more carbon atoms can also include the multiphase fluorochemical, such as the \u201cdual action\u201d fluorochemical.",
        "Generally, the textile of the present invention can include banner or sign fabrics, upholstery fabrics, drapery fabrics, other fabrics for home furnishings, napery fabrics, apparel fabrics, carpeting, and the like. The textile can be a woven, knitted, non-woven material, tufted materials, and the like. Woven textiles can include, but are not limited to, satin, poplin, and crepe weave textiles. Knit textiles can include, but are not limited to, circular knit, warp knit, and warp knit with a microdenier face. The textile may be flat, or may exhibit a pile. Such textile materials can be formed of natural or synthetic fibers, such as polyester, nylon, wool, cotton, silk, polypropylene, rayon, lyocell, poly(lactide), acrylic, and the like, including textile materials containing mixtures and combinatios of such natural and synthetic fibers.",
        "Repellant finish chemicals include fluorochemicals, silicones, resin-based finishes, waxes, wax-metal emulsions, organometallic complexes, and combinations thereof. It is believed that the repellant properties of the repellant finish chemicals help prevent the colorant from being absorbed into the textile, and facilitates allowing the colorant to fill the entire intended zone for the colorant.",
        "Fluorochemical repellants include chemicals that contain perfluorocarbon groups. The fluorochemical repellants can be the products of copolymers of perfluoroalkyl acrylates or methacrylates with other comonomers. The comonomers include esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid containing alkyl groups, alkylamide groups, or polyether groups. The fluorochemical repellants can also be emulsions or solvent solutions for application to the textile material.",
        "Silicone repellants include polymers of methyl(hydrogen)siloxane and dimethylsiloxane. In one embodiment, the silicones are an aqueous emulsion or a solvent solution for application to the textile material.",
        "Resin-based finishes include modified melamine formaldehyde resin based finishes, and can be blended with waxes. In one example, the resin-based finishes are a water soluble material such as Aerotex M3 from BF Goodrich for application to the textile material.",
        "In the version of the present invention using a \u201cdual action\u201d, fluorochemical, the \u201cdual action\u201d fluorochemical is a fluorochemical that has hydrophobic properties under a first condition, and hydrophilic properties under a second condition. Typically, the two conditions changing the properties of the \u201cdual action\u201d fluorochemical related to the temperature. For example, the \u201cdual action\u201d fluorochemical can exhibit hydrophobic properties at room temperature, and hydrophillic properties at an elevated temperature. \u201cDual action\u201d fluorochemicals generally have block copolymers with a fluorine containing hydrophobic segment and a hydrophilic segment. One common hydrophilic segment is an alkylene oxide containing segment. The block copolymer will typically have a backbone such as an acrylate or a urethane, which contain the hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments. It is believed that under the first condition the fluorinated segment aligns at the surface, resulting in the oil and water repellency, and that under the second condition the polyethylene oxide containing segment aligns at the surface, resulting in the hydrophilic properties. Various commerically available \u201cdual action\u201d fluorochemicals include FC-248 and FC-268 from 3M, Repearl F-84 and Repearl SR-216 from Mitsubishi International, and Unidyne S1040 and Unidyne TG-992 from Daikin.",
        "It is believed that when the \u201cdual action\u201d fluorochemical class of repellant finish chemicals are present on the textile substrate under normal room temperatures, the \u201cdual action\u201d fluorochemical experiences the first condition of the hydrophobic state, thereby helping to prevent the colorant from being absorbed into the textile and facilitating the spread of the color medium to fill the entire intended zone for the color medium, just as with the standard repellant finish chemical. However, it is also believed that when the printed textile substrate is subjected to heat for fixing the colorant image, the dual action fluorochemical experiences the second condition of the hydrophilic state, thereby allowing the colorant to better penetrate the textile to help fix the color.",
        "Cationic materials are materials that have a positive charge. The charge of the cationic material could also be a partial charge. It is believed that the cationic material helps hold the colorant on the surface of the intended zone, thereby reducing any bleeding of the color medium into unintended areas or absorption of the colorant into the textile. Cationic materials that can be used for the present invention include, but are not limited to, polymeric or non-polymeric organic compounds, and metal salts. In one version of the present invention, the cationic compounds are organic cationic materials that include two or more carbon atoms.",
        "Polymeric cationic materials and non-polymeric organic cationic materials of the present invention, including the version of the invention having two or more carbon atoms, can include nitrogen-containing and phosphorus-containing materials. Nitrogen containing cationic materials include, but are not limited to, various primary amines (such as polyvinylamine or polyallyamine), secondary amines, tertiary amines, quaternary amines, and amines converted to cationic amines under acidic conditions. Examples of nitrogen containing cationic polymer materials include homopolymers or copolymers of cationic monomers. Cationic monomers can include diallyldimethylammonium chloride, or methacrylamidopropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, or the like. Phosphorus containing cationic material include, but are not limited to, the phosphonium group. Examples of a phosphonium group cationic material include stearyltributyl phosphonium bromide, or the like.",
        "Metal salts that can be used for the cationic material of the present invention include water soluble salts of cations from Group II, Group III, or the Transition Metals of the Periodic Table. Examples include magnesium, calcium, aluminum, zinc, zirconium, and boron. In one embodiment, the salts have an anion of a weak acid, such as acetate forming or the like.",
        "The sorbant polymer is also used to fix the colorant to the textile, to create an image with good resolution and edge acuity. A sorbant polymer is a polymer that the ink components, such as dyes, have a greater affinity for than those ink components have for the textile material substrate.

A measure of color intensity, \u0394Ep, may be determined by this method. \u0394Ep is generally calculated according to the following equation:\n\n\u0394Ep=((Lbackground\u2212Lprinted)2+(abackground\u2212aprinted)2+(bbackground\u2212bprinted)2)1/2\n\nwherein \u0394Ep represents the difference in color between the background textile and the textile after printing.
