        "The present application relates generally to cement-free zeolite and Class F fly ash settable fluids and methods for using such settable fluids as cementitious materials for sealing a subterranean zone penetrated by a wellbore or for using such fluids as settable spotting fluids.",
        "In the drilling of an oil or gas well, a wellbore is drilled using a drilling fluid that is continuously circulated down a drill pipe, through a drill bit, and upwardly through the wellbore to the surface. When the desired drilling depth of the well is reached, a pipe string, e.g., a casing, is run into the wellbore. After clean-up operations are performed in the wellbore, a cement composition is pumped into the annular space between the walls of the wellbore and the casing. In this method, known as \u201cprimary cementing\u201d, the cement composition sets in the annular space, supporting and positioning the casing, and forming a substantially impermeable barrier, or cement sheath, that isolates the wellbore from subterranean zones. Performance of the cement composition is important to achieving and maintaining zonal isolation.",
        "During operations performed in a wellbore, a number of problems can occur such as difficulty in removing portions of the drilling fluid, or an inability to achieve a satisfactory bond between the pipe and the walls of the wellbore due to drilling fluid that remains in the wellbore during primary cementing operations. Incomplete removal of drilling fluid may interfere with proper setting of cement resulting in poor bonding between the cement and the subterranean formation. Even though spacer fluids are commonly used for displacing the drilling fluid from the wellbore prior to cementing, frequently such displacement efforts still leave pockets of drilling fluid in the wellbore.",
        "Settable spotting fluids (SSF's) were developed to help reduce risks associated with incomplete drilling fluid displacement, and to improve zonal isolation. SSF's have rheological properties that can effect optimum mud displacement and are compatible with cement slurries. SSF's contain a hydraulic material that can allow them to set with time. If an SSF is bypassed during displacement, the fluid and filter cake from the drilling fluid will set up providing compressive strength. However, drilling fluids and spacer fluids lack cementitious properties. Therefore, using an SSF can be superior to circulating a drilling fluid into the well before cementing. Bypassing the drilling fluid with the cement slurry results in partial zonal isolation.",
        "Conventional settable spotting fluids include a material that sets over time, such as blast furnace slag, fly ash, and similar hydraulic components. Water-based settable spotting fluids have been designed with either fly ash (U.S. Pat. No. 6,138,759 to Chatterji et al., filed Dec. 16, 1999) or zeolite (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/738,199, filed Dec. 17, 2003) in which lime-hydrate was used for activation.",
        "FIG. 1 shows the time in days to reach 50 psi (0.34 MPa) @160\u00b0 F. (71.1\u00b0 C.) in an ultrasonic cement analyzer as a function of retarder concentration.",
        "FIG. 2 shows compressive strength data in psi obtained by the Tinius Olsen method for slurries 1-7 of Table 4 of Example 2 plotted as a function of zeolite concentration. The slurries were cured in a water bath at 80\u00b0 F. (26.7\u00b0 C.) for 72 hours. Slurries having up to and including 40% zeolite had a slurry density of 13.8 ppg (1656 Kg/m3) and slurries having 50% or greater zeolite had a slurry density of 12 ppg (1440 Kg/m3).",
        "FIG. 3 provides data on UCA compressive strength development versus time in hours for four 13.8 ppg (1656 Kg/m3) slurries at 80\u00b0 F. (26.7\u00b0 C.). The data are designated as follows:\n\n    \n    \n        Fly Ash: Pozmix\u00aeA+lime at 15%, no Na2SO4, no zeolite;\n        Fly Ash+Na2SO4: Pozmix\u00aeA+lime at 15%, 2% Na2SO4, no zeolite (Slurry 4 of Table 4);\n        Fly Ash+Zeo+2% Na2SO4: Pozmix\u00aeA+lime at 15%, 2% Na2SO4, 15% zeolite (Slurry 3 of Table 4);\n        Fly Ash+Zeo+3% Na2SO4: Pozmix\u00aeA+lime at 15%, 3% Na2SO4, 15% zeolite.",

        "Zeolite and Class F fly ash settable fluids are provided herein for use as a cement-free settable spotting fluid and as a cement-free cementitious settable fluid composition in cementing operations. The term \u201ccementitious,\u201d as used herein, means having the properties of cement. The settable spotting fluids have a set delay time that can be adjusted by the ratio of components. The cementitious materials are suitable for a broad range of cementing applications, in particular, at low temperature, and provide for pumpable slurries that have a broad density range.",
        "According to embodiments described herein, a blended cement-free zeolite and Class F fly ash settable spotting fluid composition is provided. The fluid comprises a zeolite, Class F fly ash, a source of calcium ion, and a carrier fluid. In embodiments of the invention, the settable spotting fluid further comprises a retarder, and in further embodiments of the invention, the settable spotting fluid comprises an activator. When the settable spotting fluid sets, the set fluid has a compressive strength comparable to that of a settable spotting fluid in which zeolite is the only settable material. For example, as shown in Example 1 below, a settable spotting fluid having an equal weight ratio of zeolite and fly ash developed a compressive strength of 400 psi (2.75 MPa) in 7 days at 160\u00b0 F. (71\u00b0 C.) while a control composition of fly ash did not set during that period of time. By comparison, a settable spotting fluid where zeolite is the only settable material set in 5 hours with a compressive strength of 500 psi (3.45MPa).",
        "The settable spotting fluid is used in oil field operations as described herein and assists in addressing difficulty in removing portions of drilling fluid, mud, spacer fluid, or filter cake from a wellbore. The settable spotting fluid remains fluid with low gel strength for extended periods, having a setting time of 2 to 50 times longer than a settable spotting fluid in which zeolite is the only settable material. Because the slurry remains fluid, the settable spotting fluid contributes to wellbore hydrostatic pressure transmission and helps to maintain control while casing is run in the well. The settable spotting fluid of the present invention can provide isolation in wellbore channels created by poor displacement efficiency during a primary cementing method due to its compatibility with cement.",
        "According to further embodiments described herein, a blended cement-free cementitious zeolite and Class F fly ash settable fluid is provided. The composition comprises a base mix of zeolite and Class F fly ash, a source of calcium ion, an accelerator, and a carrier fluid. In embodiments of the invention, the settable fluid comprises an activator.",
        "The amounts of the components of the cementitious zeolite and Class F fly ash settable fluids are adjusted to achieve a target setting time. In certain embodiments where a wellbore is being cemented, a target setting time may begin in 2 to 6 hours after placement in the wellbore with the setting reaching a compressive strength plateau within a further time period of about one day as described in Example 2 below. Cement-free cementitious settable fluids are suitable for use in a broad temperature range including low temperature cementing applications. Such settable fluids are also useful for preparation of pumpable slurries having a density range that is broader than a density range that is possible with just zeolite and lime compositions. In particular, a settable fluid having 85% fly-ash in a base mix provided a compressive strength of 495 psi (3.42 MPa) at a temperature of 80\u00b0 F. (26.7\u00b0 C.). This particular slurry demonstrated a pumpable rheology with a density of 13.8 ppg (1656 Kg/m3).",
        "The cementitious settable fluids of embodiments of the present invention are useful as a replacement for hydraulic cement, in particular, where cement is to be set in a water environment.",
        "Zeolites: Zeolites are porous alumino-silicate minerals that may be either a natural or manmade material. Manmade zeolites are based on the same type of structural cell as natural zeolites, and are composed of aluminosilicate hydrates having the same basic formula as given below. It is understood that as used in this application, the term \u201czeolite\u201d means and encompasses all natural and manmade forms of zeolites. All zeolites are composed of a three-dimensional framework of SiO4 and AlO4 in a tetrahedron, which creates a very high surface area. Cations and water molecules are entrained into the framework. Thus, all zeolites may be represented by the crystallographic unit cell formula:\n\nMa/n[(AlO2)a(SiO2)b]\u00b7xH2O.\n\nM represents one or more cations such as Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Li or Ba for natural zeolites and NH4, CH3NH3, (CH3)3NH, (CH3)4N, Ga, Ge and P for manmade zeolites; n represents the cation valence; the ratio of b:a is in a range from greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 5; and x represents the moles of water entrained into the zeolite framework.",
        "Preferred zeolites for use in the settable fluids of the present embodiments include analcime (hydrated sodium aluminum silicate), bikitaite (lithium aluminum silicate), brewsterite (hydrated strontium barium calcium aluminum silicate), chabazite (hydrated calcium aluminum silicate), clinoptilolite (hydrated sodium aluminum silicate), faujasite (hydrated sodium potassium calcium magnesium aluminum silicate), harmotome (hydrated barium aluminum silicate), heulandite (hydrated sodium calcium aluminum silicate), laumontite (hydrated calcium aluminum silicate), mesolite (hydrated sodium calcium aluminum silicate), natrolite (hydrated sodium aluminum silicate), paulingite (hydrated potassium sodium calcium barium aluminum silicate), phillipsite (hydrated potassium sodium calcium aluminum silicate), scolecite (hydrated calcium aluminum silicate), stellerite (hydrated calcium aluminum silicate), stilbite (hydrated sodium calcium aluminum silicate) and thomsonite (hydrated sodium calcium aluminum silicate). Most preferably, the zeolites for use herein include chabazite and clinoptilolite.",
        "For the settable spotting fluids of the present embodiments, weight ratios of components are based on the amount of zeolite present. For the cementitious settable fluids of the present embodiments, zeolite is present in an amount by weight of a base mix of zeolite and class F fly ash and is present in an amount of from greater than zero to less than 100% by weight of the base mix. In additional embodiments of the cementitious composition, zeolite is present in an amount ranging between any of and including any of 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% by weight of base mix.",
        "Particle sizes of zeolites are measured on a Malvern Particle Size Analyzer, available from Malvern Instruments Ltd., of Worcestershire, UK, for example. For a given particle size, the Particle Size Analyzer identifies the volume percentage of particles in the sample that are beneath that particle size. The Particle Size Analyzer also provides a median particle size. Another parameter reported by the Particle Size Analyzer is the \u201cspan,\u201d that describes the width of the distribution independent of the median particle size. For example, two zeolites, clinoptilolite and chabazite, have very similar median particle size. However, clinoptilolite has a much higher span, meaning that clinoptilolite has more particles with larger size as compared to chabazite. A smaller sized particle provides a packed or reactive surface area that is greater than the packed or reactive surface area of larger sized particles. For a given zeolite-activator composition with the same median particle size, compressive strength is inversely proportional to the span of the particle size distribution. With a comparable or narrower span of particle size distribution, better compressive strengths are obtained with a smaller mean particle size. According to certain embodiments described herein, the mean particle size for a zeolite is less than or equal to 100 microns. In further embodiments, the mean particle size for a zeolite is less than or equal to 90 microns, 80 microns, 70 microns, 60 microns, 50 microns, 40 microns, 30 microns, 20 microns, or 10 microns. In a further embodiment, the mean particle size for a zeolite is greater than 1.0 micron and less than or equal to 10 microns.",
        "Fly Ash: The presence of Class F fly ash in embodiments of the present invention provides settable fluids that are less expensive than settable fluids in which zeolite is the only settable material. Fly ash is produced by the combustion of powdered coal with a forced draft. The fly ash which is carried by the flue gases is recovered, for example, by electrostatic precipitators. Class F fly ash is commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services as Pozmix\u00ae A. For the settable spotting fluid of the present embodiments, Class F fly ash is present in an amount of from greater than zero to about 600% by weight of zeolite and, in additional embodiments, is present in an amount ranging between any of and including any of 50%, 100%, 200%, 300%, 400% or 500% by weight of zeolite. For the cementitious settable fluids of the present embodiments, Class F fly ash is present in an amount greater than zero and less than 100% by weight of a base mix of zeolite and Class F fly ash and, in additional embodiments, is present in an amount ranging between any of and including any of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% or 95% by weight of base mix.",
        "Source of Calcium Ion: A source of calcium ion is required for Class F fly ash to form a cementitious composition with water. Calcium ion is present in the settable fluids of the present invention in an amount of from about 5% to about 50% by weight of Class F fly ash and, in certain embodiments, calcium is present in the settable fluids of the present invention in an amount ranging between any of and including any of 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40% or 45% by weight of Class F fly ash. A source of calcium may be the activator, or a calcium salt such as a salt having an anion containing a Group 4a, Group 5a, Group 6a, or Group 7a element, or a combination thereof, of the periodic table. That is, carbonates, carboxylates, silicates, nitrates, nitrites, phosphates, sulfates, sulfites, and halide salts of calcium in addition to oxides and hydroxides of calcium provide a source of calcium, for example.",
        "Activator: The activator catalyzes the pozzolan \u201ccementing\u201d reaction. The activator is present in the settable fluids in an amount of from about 5% to about 50% by weight of zeolite for the settable spotting fluid and in an amount of from about 5% to about 50% by weight of the base mix for the cementitious settable fluids. In further embodiments, the activator is present in the settable fluids in an amount ranging between any of and including any of 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, or 40% by weight of the zeolite for settable spotting fluids or by weight of the base mix for cementitious settable fluids. The activator may be one or more of lime, lime hydrate, calcium hydroxide, calcium chloride, sodium silicate, sodium fluoride, sodium silicofluoride, magnesium silicofluoride, zinc silicofluoride, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium sulfate, or hydrates thereof. In one embodiment, the activator is calcium hydroxide. Selection of the type and amount of activator depends on the type and make-up of the composition in which the activator is contained, and it is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the present disclosure how to select a suitable type and amount of activator.",
        "Retarder: The term, \u201cretarder,\u201d as used in this application means a composition having properties of slowing the setting time of a zeolite-fly ash/activator settable fluid and, thereby, controlling the setting time of such a composition. Controlling the set time is desirable for a settable spotting fluid, for example, to allow flexibility to adjust to wellbore conditions, or to adjust for adequate removal of drilling or spacer fluids. Suitable retarders include but are not limited to one or more of a lignosulfonate, an organic acid having an \u03b1-hydroxy group such as citric acid, tartaric acid or gluconic acid, salts thereof, and combinations thereof. Further examples of carboxylic acids that retard the setting time include carboxylic acids such as malic acid, lactic acid, combinations thereof, as well as alkaline earth metal salts thereof such as calcium, potassium, or barium salts, and the like. The salt of the organic acid may have a cation containing an element of the periodic chart listed in Group I or in Group II. Selection of the type and amount of retarder largely depends on the nature and composition of the set composition, and those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the present disclosure will understand how to select a suitable type and amount of retarder.",
        "In general, the retarder is present in an amount of from about 1.0% by weight of zeolite to about 5.0% by weight of zeolite for settable spotting fluids and, in additional embodiments, the retarder is present in an amount ranging between any of and including any of 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.4%, 2.5%, 2.6%, 2.7%, 2.8%, 2.9%, 3.0%, 3.2%, 3.5% or 4.0% by weight of zeolite for settable spotting fluids. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand in light of the present disclosure how to exert control over the amount of time that it takes the settable fluid to set by determining, through the exercise of routine experimentation, the amount of retarder necessary to achieve a set over a desired period of time. In general, settable fluids having an amount of an organic acid retarder greater than about 5.0% by weight of the zeolite have an impractically long setting time. In one embodiment, the retarder comprises a 2/1 lignosulfonate/tartaric acid solution, commercially available under the tradename HR-13L from Halliburton Energy Services, Duncan, Okla.",
        "A retarder in addition to an accelerator may be used in settable fluids of the present invention useful as cementitious materials. The set time of a cementitious slurry may be adjusted to a desired set time by one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the present disclosure by adjusting the amount of an accelerator and the amount of a retarder.",
        "Accelerators: Setting accelerators increase the rate of the setting reaction and are added to the mixes for cementitious settable fluids. Setting accelerators include compounds such as sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, sodium aluminate, sodium carbonate, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, aluminum sulfate, potassium sulfate, potassium carbonate and alums, or a combination thereof, for example. The accelerating additives are present in an amount of from about 0.5% to about 9.0% based on the weight of the base mix and, in additional embodiments, the accelerators are present in an amount ranging between any of and including any of 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0%, 5.0%, 6.0%, 7.0% or 8.0% of the weight of the base mix. In particular embodiments, an accelerator is present in settable fluids where conditions of a setting temperature is less than about 140\u00b0 F. (60.0\u00b0 C.). In certain embodiments, sodium sulfate is the accelerator.",
        "Carrier Fluids: Carrier fluids suitable for use in embodiments of the settable fluids of the present invention comprise aqueous fluids, oil-based and synthetic-based fluids, emulsions, acids, or mixtures thereof. Exemplary aqueous fluids include but are not limited to water and water-based gels. When the carrier fluid comprises water, the water can be fresh water, unsaturated salt solution, including brines and seawater, and saturated salt solution. The carrier fluid is present in an amount of from about 20% to about 200% by weight of zeolite for compositions for settable spotting fluids, and in an amount of from about 20% to about 200% by weight of the base mix for cementitious materials. In further embodiments, the carrier fluid is present in an amount of from about 100% to about 200%, from about 50% to about 150% or from about 100% to about 125% by weight of zeolite for settable spotting fluids, and by weight of base mix for cementitious materials. Exemplary oil-based fluids include but are not limited to canola oil, kerosene, diesel oil, fish oil, mineral oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, soy oil, olive oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil and paraffin. Exemplary synthetic-based fluids include but are not limited to esters, olefins or ethers, e.g., esters having a C2-C12 alcohol portion and a C16-C24 carboxylic acid portion, olefins having a C6-C18 linear internal portion, or ethers having a C6-C24 portion. Those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the present disclosure will understand that the carrier fluid for the settable fluids as provided herein depends upon the properties desired for the compositions, as well as the cost, availability, temperature, stability, viscosity, clarity, and the like of the carrier fluid, and further that when non-aqueous carrier fluids are used, the settable fluid is expected to be exposed to an aqueous fluid in the well for the composition to set. For example, such aqueous fluids may come from the cementitious slurry or from the subterranean formation.",
        "Setting Conditions: Setting of the settable spotting fluids and cementitious settable fluids of the present embodiments may occur under a variety of conditions including variations in time and temperature. In general, the rate of compressive strength development increases with temperature. Setting temperatures of about 32\u00b0 F. to about 200\u00b0 F. (0\u00b0 C. to 93.3\u00b0 C.) are appropriate for setting of the present compositions. In further embodiments, a temperature ranging between any of and including any of 70\u00b0 F.

Preferably, the mud in the wellbore is displaced by the settable spotting fluid before the mud has had a chance to gain significant gel strength. By displacing the mud before it gains significant gel strength, difficulties with removing portions of it during clean-up operations in the wellbore are reduced. As used herein, the term \u201cmud\u201d encompasses any fluid used in hydrocarbon drilling operations, including but not limited to all types of water-base, oil-base and synthetic-base drilling fluids, and fluids that contain significant amounts of suspended solids, emulsified water or oil.",

A cementitious slurry may then be pumped into the annulus and allowed to set, thus bonding the pipe to the walls of the wellbore. The setting of the cementitious material, and consequently the bonding of the pipe to the walls of the wellbore, is improved because difficulties with removing portions of the mud from the wellbore are reduced.",

According to such an embodiment, a subsequent composition, for example, a drilling fluid, pill, spotting fluid, cement or other mud is pumped into the wellbore. The subsequent composition is pumped into the wellbore, either after the settable spotting fluid, or after the washes or spacer fluids, if such are used.

The delay in strength development (in other words, delay in the occurrence of the pozzolan-lime reaction) was minor for retarder concentrations up to 2.4%. However, the delay became prominent at higher concentrations of retarder. Organic acid present in the retarder is believed to gradually react with the sparingly soluble Ca(OH)2 in the slurry thereby delaying the pozzolan-lime reaction that is limited by diffusion in such a condensed phase. Once the acid molecules are consumed to produce the calcium salt, strength development i.e., the pozzolan-lime reaction begins. The initial low response of the retarder at concentrations up to 2.4% is believed due to the immediate neutralization of the acid molecules upon reaction with the already dissolved Ca(OH)2 in the slurry.",

For a given density, a decrease in the compressive strength is observed as the amount of fly-ash is increased and the amount of zeolite correspondingly decreased. At 85% of fly-ash in the slurry and 15% zeolite, no dispersant (i.e., no CFR-6) is needed to prepare a mixable slurry having a high density of 13.8 ppg (1656 Kg/m3). Further, lower amounts of zeolite in the composition contribute to a lower cost of the composition. The inventors also observed that for a slurry density of 12 ppg (1440 Kg/m3) decreasing the zeolite content below 50% led to over-thinning of the slurry, and that slurries having a density of 13.8 ppg (1656 Kg/m3) were difficult to mix above 40% zeolite. Such results may be compensated for by adding either light or heavy weight additives known to one of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. In general, an increase in slurry density (from 12 to 13.8 ppg (1440 to 1656 Kg/m3)) increases the compressive strength when the slurry composition does not change except for the water content. In general, the presence of more water yields less strength.",

(26.7\u00b0 C.). However, it is known that such a composition would develop compressive strength at a temperature of 140\u00b0 F. (60.0\u00b0 C.). Addition of 2% Na2SO4 accelerates the reaction such that by 80 hours, the compressive strength is about 300 psi (2.07 MPa).
