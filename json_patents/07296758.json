        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a faucet, and more particularly to an automatic lift faucet that can hide under the working top in idle time.",
        "2. Description of Prior Art",
        "In accordance with the conventional technology, the most of the structure of the faucet located on the side of the kitchen sink occupies big space, especially nearing the window, even affect to open the window.",
        "This is the sake of discovering the present invention.",
        "It is therefore a main object of the present invention to provide an automatic lift faucet that can hide under the working top in the idle time, only lift out in use time so as to save space efficiently.",
        "For achieving the above-mentioned object, the present invention provides an automatic lift faucet that is typically comprised of a hydraulic cylinder, a lifting faucet, a lifting piston, a pressure release valve and an accumulator cylinder; wherein said hydraulic cylinder has a through-hole penetrating the both ends axially, and a inlet approaching to the low end, and is vertically mounted under the working top; said lifting faucet has an outlet at top end, and a closed bottom end, and an inlet built on the middle portion, and is mounted at the inside of the hydraulic cylinder in motion fitting connection, and is attached with a balance weight at the bottom side; said lifting piston is located on the lifting faucet coordinating to the inlet, and is attached with a pressure valve and a restoring spring for controlling the inlet communicating to the hydraulic cylinder or not; said accumulator cylinder mounted below the working top horizontally has a center baffle-plate built on the center having a central hole levelly for a valve stem fitting in, and said valve stem is attached with tow pistons fixed on the both ends respectively and crossly to divide the inside of the accumulator cylinder into three accumulator sub-chambers, such as the left end of the accumulator cylinder and the left piston surround the first accumulator sub-chamber, the left piston and the center baffle-plate construct the second sub-chamber, and the right piston and the right end of the accumulator cylinder form the third sub-chamber, coordinating to the three sub-chambers, said accumulator cylinder has three through-holes drilled on left end, middle portion and the right end respectively on the trunk communicating to said three sub-chambers individually; one branch pipe of the inlet pipe is connected to the first through-hole, and one other branch pipe is indirectly connected to the second and third through-holes, and the inlet of the hydraulic cylinder via said pressure release valve respectively.",
        "Said balance weight of the lifting faucet is the accumulator cylinder fixed on bottom end of said lifting faucet.",
        "As utilizing above-mentioned project, the present invention is mounted in place with full accumulator cylinder and hydraulic cylinder, in this time the three sub-chambers are filled water. When cutting off the inlet pipe, the pistons of said accumulator cylinder are in static without any motion, said lifting faucet is pulled down by said full accumulator cylinder working as the balance weight until to get the lowest point hiding into the working top, such as home position.",
        "When cutting on the inlet pipe, in the hydraulic cylinder, the water pressure exerting on the lifting piston is increased so as to be bigger than the sum of the weight and the friction of the lifting faucet, so the lifting piston goes up under the water pressure to lift the faucet rising from the working top gradually, but in this time, the pressure valve blocks the inlet to communicate with the hydraulic cylinder under the restoring spring and the water pressure, so the faucet is closed without water flowing out; on the other hand, in the accumulator cylinder, the sum of the leftward pressure exerting on left sides of the pistons in the second and the third accumulator sub-chambers is equal to the sum of the rightward pressure exerting on the right side of the left piston in the first accumulator sub-chamber and the friction and other contacting reaction forces, such as the valve stem is in balance, so it stays in the original position.",
        "When the lifting piston going up is stopped on the tip end of the hydraulic cylinder, in the hydraulic cylinder, said faucet is lifted to expose above the working top by the lifting piston driven by the water pressure overcoming the sum of the weight, friction and all resistance forces until the pressure valve touches against the top end of the hydraulic cylinder overcoming the sum of the water pressure and the spring force to press down the restoring spring, so as to allow the inlet communicating to the hydraulic cylinder, in this time the water in the hydraulic cylinder is led into the faucet, and spray out from the outlet of the faucet facilitating to using, in this time the pressure release valve is in action, the pressure in the water line is changed; and in the accumulator cylinder, because the water in the second and the third accumulator sub-chambers flows to the faucet via the hydraulic cylinder, so sum of the leftward pressures exerting on the right sides of the left and right pistons in the second and third accumulator cylinders is less than the rightward pressure exerting on the left side of the left piston in the first accumulator sub-chamber, so the balance is broken off, the pistons are moved to the right to assist water in the second and third accumulator cylinders with draining out until running out.",
        "When turning off the gate of the inlet pipe, in the hydraulic cylinder, the water pressure exerting on the lifting piston and the friction are less than the owning weight, so the lifting facet goes down under the weight force automatically until fully hiding under the working top; during going down, when the pressure valve is departed with the top end of the hydraulic cylinder, it is pushed up by the restoring spring to block the inlet to communicate to the hydraulic cylinder again, so the faucet is cut off without water flowing out; in this time, the water at inside of the hydraulic cylinder is pushed into the second and the third accumulator sub-chambers, in the accumulator cylinder, the increased water pressures in the second and the third accumulator sub-chambers push the left and right pistons leftward as it is bigger than sum of the water pressure in the first accumulator sub-chamber rightward and other rightward extra forces, so that the first accumulator sub-chamber starts to drain water, the drained water from the first accumulator sub-chamber is led into the second and the third accumulator sub-chambers via the pressure release valve, and they are accumulated water until the lifting faucet gets into the home position, the all system is gone back to the original state.",
        "Therefore, by means of the hydraulic cylinder, the accumulator cylinder, the pressure release valve and water pressure, the faucet hidden under the working top provided by the present invention can carry out automatic lifting up and falling down, so as to get in lifting up in using time, and falling down in idle time functions, not only facilitating to using, but also saving occupied space. Additionally, water in the whole system is circled without any pollution occurred.",

When an extra force pressed said pressure valve 31 moving down overcoming the restoring force of the restoring spring 32, the inlet 22 is opened to communicate to the hydraulic cylinder, when said extra force is eliminated from the pressure valve 31, said pressure valve 31 is pushed up under the restoring force coming from the restoring spring 32 to block off the inlet 22 again not to communicate to the hydraulic cylinder 1.",
        "Said accumulator cylinder 5 mounted below the working top A horizontally has a center baffle-plate 50 built on the center having a central hole 501 levelly for a valve stem 59 fitting in, and said valve stem 59 is attached with tow pistons 54 55 fixed on the both ends respectively and crossly to divide the inside of the accumulator cylinder 5 into three accumulator sub-chambers, such as the left end of the accumulator cylinder 5 and the left piston 54 surround the first accumulator sub-chamber 56, the left piston 54 and the center baffle-plate 50 construct the second sub-chamber 57, and the right piston 55 and the right end of the accumulator cylinder 5 form the third sub-chamber 58, coordinating to the three sub-chambers 56 57 58, said accumulator cylinder 5 has three through-holes 51 52 53 drilled on left end, middle portion and the right end respectively on the trunk communicating to said three sub-chambers individually.",

        "As tending to use, as shown in FIG. 2, when cutting on the inlet pipe, in the hydraulic cylinder 1, the water pressure exerting on the lifting piston 3 is increased so as to be bigger than the sum of the weight (including the weights of the lifting faucet 2 and the lifting piston 3, and the accumulator cylinder 5 at here and below unless otherwise noted) and the frictions, so the lifting piston 3 goes up under the water pressure to lift the faucet 2 rising from the working top A gradually, but in this time, the pressure valve 31 blocks the inlet 22 to communicate with the hydraulic cylinder 1 under the restoring spring 32 and the water pressure, so the faucet 2 is closed without water flowing out; on the other hand, in the accumulator cylinder 5, the sum of the leftward pressure exerting on left sides of the pistons 54 55 in the second and the third accumulator sub-chambers 57 58 is equal to the sum of the rightward pressure exerting on the right side of the left piston 54 in the first accumulator sub-chamber 56 and the friction and other contacting reaction forces, such as the valve stem 59 is in balance, so it stays in the original position.",
        "Referring to FIG. 3, when the lifting piston 3 going up is stopped on the tip end of the hydraulic cylinder 1, in the hydraulic cylinder 1, said faucet 2 is lifted completely to expose above the working top A by the lifting piston 3 driven by the water pressure overcoming the sum of the weight, friction and all resistance forces until the pressure valve 31 touches against the top end of the hydraulic cylinder 1 overcoming the sum of the water pressure and the spring force to press down the restoring spring 32, so as to allow the inlet 22 communicating to the hydraulic cylinder 1, in this time the water in the hydraulic cylinder 1 is led into the faucet 2, and spray out from the outlet 21 of the faucet 2 facilitating to using, in this time the pressure release valve 4 is in action, the pressure in the water line is changed.",

        "Tending to stop use, as showing in FIG. 5, when turning off the gate of the inlet pipe, in the hydraulic cylinder 1, the water pressure exerting on the lifting piston 3 and the frictions are less than said weight, so the lifting facet 2 goes down under the weight force automatically until fully hiding under the working top A getting into home position; during going down, when the pressure valve 31 is departed with the top end of the hydraulic cylinder 1, it is pushed up by the restoring spring 32 to block the inlet 22 to communicate to the hydraulic cylinder 1 again, so the faucet 2 is cut off without water flowing out; meanwhile, the water at inside of the hydraulic cylinder 1 is pushed into the second and the third accumulator sub-chambers 57 58, in the accumulator cylinder 5, the increased water pressures in the second and the third accumulator sub-chambers 57 58 push the left and right pistons 54 55 leftward as it is bigger than sum of the water pressure in the first accumulator sub-chamber 56 rightward and other rightward extra forces, so that the first accumulator sub-chamber 56 starts to drain water, the drained water from the first accumulator sub-chamber 56 is led into the second and the third accumulator sub-chambers 57 58 via the pressure release valve 4, and they are accumulated water until the lifting faucet 2 gets into the home position, the all system is gone back to the original state.",
