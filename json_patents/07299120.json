        "The invention relates to methods for reducing juddering vibrations and an electronic controller.",
        "Electronic controllers are already known. They are used, for example, in the automotive area to control certain functionalities of components, such as transmission, clutch, internal combustion engine or similar items.",
        "A known method for reducing or gradually eliminating juddering vibrations that are present in the drive train of a motor vehicle is such that the vehicle is brought to a standstill. In this case, for example, a service brake may be operated and the shifted gear disengaged. If the vehicle comes to a stop and the starting clutch is completely disengaged, juddering vibrations as a rule are gradually eliminated.",
        "The object of the invention is to produce a method for reducing juddering vibrations that is operationally reliable and ensures a good comfort, as well as an electronic controller.",
        "The objective is achieved in particular via a method for reducing juddering vibrations in a motor vehicle drive train that can be loaded by a drive device, such as an internal combustion engine, and has a clutch device as well as a transmission device, comprising the steps:\n\n    \n    \n        Determining whether juddering vibrations are present and/or establishing that juddering vibrations are present;\n        Adjustment, and especially automatic adjustment, of a device in order to counteract the juddering vibrations, this device being disposed in the drive train or coupled thereto in such a manner that a rotary parameter, such as torque or speed, that is assigned to a drive train component is modified by adjustment of this device, and the course of the juddering vibration, as a result of this change, is modified over time.",
        "In particular, a method for reducing juddering vibrations that occur in a motor vehicle drive train is provided. This motor vehicle drive train may be loaded by a drive device. Such a drive device may be, for example, an internal combustion engine. Also provided in the drive train are a clutch device and a transmission device. The clutch device may, for example, be an electronically controlled clutch device. Such an electronically controlled clutch device may be configured, for example, like an electronically controlled clutch device offered by the applicant under the designation \u201cElectronic Clutch Management\u201d (EKM). However, an electronically controlled clutch device may also be configured differently.",
        "The transmission device may be of any type. It may be shifted in such a manner that it is possible to select different ratios. It may have, in particular, shift steps or be continuously variable. For example, the transmission device may be an automatic transmission or an automated-shift transmission (ASG) or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Also other types of transmissions may be used.",
        "The method for avoiding juddering vibrations may in particular be such that the juddering vibrations are \u201cweakened\u201d without them being eliminated. However, this does not necessarily mean that the juddering vibrations are immediately reduced or eliminated. The method may also be such that only in the course of the method are the juddering vibrations counteracted, while in some cases, in the meantime, the juddering vibrations are assisted, especially in an undesired way. However, the method may also be such that the juddering vibrations are directly counteracted.",
        "It is provided in particular according to the invention that a check or determination is made of whether juddering vibrations are present. This does not necessarily mean that it is absolutely guaranteed that the juddering vibrations are present. It may be provided, for example, that it is not excluded or assumed that or whether juddering vibrations are present. The determination of juddering vibrations may also be such that certain measures are also implemented from which it is concluded that juddering vibrations are present. For example, this may be such that\u2014and there are also many additional possibilities\u2014that the speed of the transmission input shaft is examined and a vibrating characteristic, or a characteristic in which a vibration is shifted, is evaluated as a sign that juddering vibrations are present.",
        "It is further provided according to the invention that a device is adjusted in order to counteract the juddering vibrations. This adjustment preferably occurs in an automatically and/or electronically controlled manner. The device that is adjusted is disposed within the drive train or coupled thereto in such a manner that, by adjusting this device, a rotary parameter assigned to a drive train component is changed. Such a rotary parameter may in particular be a torque or a rotary speed. The aforementioned device, in a preferred embodiment, is the clutch device. This device may, however also be a different device. For example, this device may also be the engine or a throttle valve or the like. Thus, the throttle angle could be changed, for example, in order to change the engine speed or the engine torque. It is also preferred that juddering vibrations be counteracted by specific shift operations of the transmission.",
        "However, for the sake of simplification, the invention may be illustrated using a design in which the device in question is a clutch device, and a rotary parameter assigned to a drive train component is changed via an adjustment of this clutch device. However, it should be noted that another device might be used accordingly instead of this clutch device.",
        "According to the invention, it is provided in particular that the adjustment of the device, in the preferred example a clutch device, changes the time characteristic of the juddering vibration. This change is preferred so that the juddering vibration is reduced or even gradually removed.",
        "Juddering vibrations are, in the sense of the invention, in particular vibrations of the transmission input against the vehicle. Quantitatively, the judder may be represented by the relative speed \u03c9Grabbing, which may be represented in particular as the difference of the angular or rotary speed of the transmission input, on the one hand, and the product of the shifted gear ratio (iGear) or the ratio assigned to the shifted gear and the angular or rotary speed of the driven wheel (\u03c9Wheel). However, in some cases other ratios could also be considered. However, the invention is not limited by the indicated connection. There may also be designs in which the judder may be quantitatively expressed in another manner.",
        "The method of the invention may also be used in particular to prevent self-excited juddering vibrations. In self-excited juddering, the relative rotary or angular speed of the juddering (\u03c9Grabbing) vibrates with an intrinsic frequency that may be, for example, in the range of 10 Hz. However, other frequency values are also possible.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, it is provided that the torque that is transmissible by the clutch device and/or the clutch control travel is modulated in order to counteract the juddering vibrations. For many clutches there exists a connection between the torque transmissible by the clutch and the clutch control travel. However, there may also be clutches in which, for example, it is possible to change the transmissible torque without a clutch control travel being changed. Likewise, the connection between the transmissible torque and the clutch control travel may be at least in part such that a travel change does not or does not always cause a change to the transmissible torque. Cited as an example of this, is that a clutch is disengaged far enough that it no longer transmits any torque; in clutches of this type, it is frequently provided that the clutch control travel in this disengaged state, in which no torque is transmitted, may be changed.",
        "For the sake of simplicity, in the following regarding such designs one speaks of a change of the modulation of the clutch control travel. However, it should be noted that a modulation or change of the torque transmitted by the clutch may likewise be provided. In the preferred embodiment, it is therefore preferably provided that, even if only the clutch control travel is mentioned, the corresponding designs relate to the torque transmissible by the clutch.",
        "It should be noted is the transmissible clutch torque or torque transmissible by the clutch is especially preferred is the reference clutch torque, and the clutch control travel is especially preferred is the reference clutch control travel. These reference quantities may be prescribed and then driven, for example, by a control device. This relates in particular to characteristic values that are modulated.",
        "It is especially preferred that the clutch control travel is modulated to reduce the vibrations in a vibrational manner, especially sinusoidally. This modulation may in particular be such that a sinusoidal function is superimposed on a particular prescribed or controlled clutch position or a clutch control travel or the time characteristic of these parameters.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, a prescribed parameter of the time characteristic of the juddering vibration and/or a rotary parameter of a drive train component is calculated. Such a parameter or rotary parameter may be, for example, the transmission input speed. The transmission input speed may also be used, for example, to check whether juddering vibrations are present.",
        "This parameter or rotary parameter may, for example, also be estimated or calculated or measured. Such a parameter may, for example, also be the amplitude and/or the duration of period and/or the phase of the juddering vibration or the angular speed or rotary speed of a drive component.",
        "Especially preferred is the phase and/or the amplitude and/or the duration of the juddering vibration is calculated as a function of the transmission speed or as a function of the time characteristic of the transmission input speed.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, the phrase and/or the amplitude and/or the duration of period of the vibration modulation of the clutch control travel is calculated as a function of the speed. The transmission input speed may be estimated, for example, or calculated. In a preferred embodiment, the transmission input speed is measured, and a suitable measuring device is provided. Such a measuring device may be configured in different ways. A preferred measuring device is designed in such a manner that speed signals are provided at time intervals.",
        "In a preferred design it is provided that the period and/or the phase and/or the amplitude of the modulated clutch control travel is determined as a function of at least one local extremum of the transmission input speed. This local extremum may in particular be a local maximum.",
        "In this context, the local extremum of the transmission speed may in particular be calculated or estimated or measured.",
        "It is preferable that the local extremum be determined in a manifold manner. In so doing, it is possible to increase the degree of precision of this determination. For example, it may first be provided that such a local extremum is determined using measured values at time intervals and then the precision is increased by a calculation being made as a function of these measured values or, in some cases, additional factors.",
        "It is also preferable that local extremum of this type in the time characteristic of the transmission input speed, which may in particular be local maxima, are used to determine the phase of the transmission input speed. It may also be provided in this embodiment that the transmission input speed in this context was measured or calculated or estimated. Moreover, as previously illustrated, a manifold determination of the local extrema or the phases may be carried out, and especially in such a manner that the degree of precision is increased.",
        "Especially in the determination of the phase of the transmission input speed or the juddering vibration, it may be provided that different influences which could cause a deviation of timing position of the extrema and maxima from the actual one are taken into consideration in order to obtain more precise values for the extrema, especially maxima, of the transmission input speed or the juddering vibration.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, the modulation of the clutch control travel is carried out in such a way that, within the context of the precision, the phase and the period essentially correspond to those of the speed of the transmission input shaft, or those which were determined in relation to the speed of the transmission input shaft. It is also preferred that the amplitude of the modulated clutch control travel be prescribed to be proportional to the judder amplitude of the transmission input speed. The judder amplitude is especially preferably defined from a comparison between the filtered and unfiltered transmission input speed. In this context it is provided in particular that the transmission input speed, on the one hand, is treated as a transmission input speed with a vibrating portion and, on the other hand, as a transmission input speed without a vibrating portion; the latter may in particular be an average transmission input speed. In this context, the non-vibrating one is the filtered one, while the vibrating one is the unfiltered one. In a preferred form, it is also provided that at least first and in a first step, the amplitude of the transmission input speed is determined in such a way that the speed is determined within specified evaluation periods or interrupts. These interrupts may have a specific duration, such as 2.5 ms or 5 ms or 10 ms. Other values for this duration are also preferable. Another type of speed measurement or calculation may also be provided.",
        "In such a preferred design, in which the speed is determined within prescribed interrupts, it may be provided in particular that during this interval pulses of rotary transducer are counted and set in a ratio with the time. In the maximum search, it is possible, for example, to check how the particular rotary speed values, which may each be assigned to a particular interrupt, behave in comparison to the adjacent rotary speed values. Using such a comparison, a local maximum may, for example, be determined for the rpm's or speed. In a preferred embodiment, it is provided that a first parameter of the juddering vibration and/or the time characteristic of the transmission input speed, especially an extremum such as a maximum, is determined via an estimation and/or a calculation and/or a measurement in a first step. This may, for example, be such that a maximum search is carried out in the aforementioned manner.",
        "Preferably, to improve and/or check the precision of the parameter calculated in the first step, this first parameter is determined in a second step as a function of the result of the first step. To this end, for example, calculations or other measures that increase the precision may be made. In a preferred, very specific embodiment of the invention, it may be provided, for example, that using speed signals set a time intervals that were calculated in the aforementioned manner, for example, via rotary transducer, local maxima are calculated by comparison with adjacent signals. Next, the deviation of the timing position of an actual maximum may be determined, for example, via calculation. Using different calculations, it is possible to consider, for example, deviations that have different causes, such as a deviation that is attributable to the fact that rpm or rotary speed signals at the time are provided only at time intervals, or deviations that are required by a non-vibrating portion of the time characteristic of the rpm's, or deviations that are required by the evaluation. It should be noted that the invention is not to be limited by preferred, exemplary embodiments. In particular, a plurality of additional exemplary embodiments may be provided in which a characteristic is determined in the first step and then the precision is improved or reviewed in a second step.",
        "Such a parameter may in particular be a local extremum of the time characteristic of the transmission input speed.",
        "It is also preferable that, using this parameter, which is determined in a first and a second step, or the difference of these parameters, calculated in different steps, an additional characteristic, such as the phase of the transmission input speed, is calculated.",
        "Especially preferably according to the invention the transmission input speed is only measured and/or evaluated so that tachometers are provided at time intervals. In a first step, at least one local extremum, such as a local maximum of these measured values can be determined in this design. This may, for example, be such that the local extremum is determined via a comparison to the adjacent measured values of the time characteristic. In particular, it may be provided that for the case that a plurality of local extrema are detected, the last one to occur is selected. In this preferred embodiment, the local extremum in some cases may deviate from the actual local extremum because only individual measured values, which in some cases are also average values, and which are set at time intervals are taken into consideration. In this preferred embodiment, it is especially preferred that in a second step, the actual local extremum or maximum of the transmission input speed is more closely approximated or calculated. It is also preferable that the time interval or the deviation between the timing position of the extremum calculated in the first step and the local extremum or local maximum calculated in the second step is calculated.",
        "In the following, for the sake of simplicity, only a local maximum is discussed, it being acknowledged that a local minimum by all means may be used. Depending on the purpose of use other characteristic values may also be used, if necessary. Therefore, for example, zero crossings of the vibrating portion could also be used for phase determination, whereby in this case, if necessary, consideration would be made of whether the vibrating portion is transitioning from the negative range into the positive range or vice-versa.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, the phase angle of the transmission input speed is calculated, and in particular is roughly calculated, in a first phase. For this purpose, local extrema or zero crossings could be used, in some cases while taking into consideration the slope. Therefore, an extremum of this type may be, for example, a local maximum that is used on the basis of speed signals that are spaced at time intervals, which are each provided, depending on the particular case, for an interrupt or an evaluation period. In a manner already illustrated, this may, for example, be such that rpm signals are compared with adjacent ones, and based on such comparisons, individual rpm signals are considered as a local extremum. In this context, it may be provided that the deviation between the phase angle determined in the first step and the actual phase angle of the transmission input speed is calculated or approximated in a second step. This may in particular be such that, based on the deviation of the timing position between a local maximum determined in the first step and a local maximum determined in the second step corresponding to or at least approximating the actual one, the phase shift is determined.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides that in the determination of such a deviation, if this is the case, the fact that rpm signals spaced at time intervals are used is taken into consideration. It is also especially preferable that measurement accuracy, which is directly required by the rotational speed sensing measurement in the first step, is taken into consideration.",
        "One example which, however, should not limit the invention is such that a deviation, or as a part of the deviation, the quotient from an angle \u03c6Pulse and two times a local extremum of the angular speed \u03c9max that was calculated in the first step, is considered as the deviation. The angle \u03c9Pulse would in this example be an angle that is present between two adjacent teeth of a speed sensor. The aforementioned deviation is also called dPulse for the sake of simplicity.",
        "It is also preferable that a partial deviation be considered, which is attributable to the fact that a control or an evaluation, especially an evaluation of the transmission speed, only takes place once within a prescribed time frame or time interrupt (Tint), and therefore, only one value is considered for the transmission speed\u2014if this is the case. This may, to cite one example, be such that a speed sensor provided with teeth enables pulses to be detected corresponding to its number of teeth, and in a prescribed time interval, such as 2.5 ms or 5 ms or 10 ms, the number of pulses are counted and from this the speed or the wind velocity derived for the time interval. In this context, for example, a deviation from an actual value of the timing position of an extremum that is required as a result may be considered. This may, for example, be such that the deviation required thereby, which for the sake of simplicity is called dInterrupt or dInt, is calculated as follows:\n\ndinterrupt=0.5*Tint+0.5*(Median\u2212tmax)*[3*\u03c9max/(d2\u03c9/dt*Tint2+5/4],\n\nwhereby Tint is the duration of the evaluation time interval or interrupt; Median is a median that describes the focal point of predetermined evaluation pairs, such as three evaluation pairs, that indicates an assignment of the angular speed or rotary speed of the transmission input shaft at particular instants; Tmax is an instant at which a local maximum \u03c9max or \u03c9i of \u03c9 is determined in a first step; and d2\u03c9/dt is the second time derivative of \u03c9.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, in determining the deviation, any increase of the transmission input speed, which is essentially independent of the juddering vibration or transmission speed vibration, may also be considered. This may also be an average drop of the transmission speed.",
        "This deviation, which is called dGradient for the sake of simplicity, may be described in the approximation as the quotient of the total or average slope B of the transmission input speed and the product of Amplitude A, or the last measured amplitude value of the vibrating portion of the transmission speed, which essentially corresponds to the last found or detected maximum of the vibrating portion of the transmission speed, and the square of \u03c9Grabbing whereby \u03c9Grabbing corresponds to (2*\u03c0) times the juddering frequency.",
        "Preferably, the deviation is calculated on the basis of the following equation:\n\ntPeak\u2212tmax\u2248\u2212dInterrupt\u2212dGradient\u2212dPulse,\n\ntPeak being the instant at which the actual extremum or maximum is present or a value that more closely approximates this value compared to the one given for Tmax, and \u201c\u2248\u201d indicating that there is an approximate correlation.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, one, several or all of the following values or parameters are considered for the\u2014or in the\u2014determination of the deviation, that is, in particular a deviation between a local extremum, such as a local maximum, of the transmission input speed determined in a first step and the actual extremum or the value for this local extremum or maximum that approximates the actual extremum, or maximum, in a second step.",
        "A first parameter is the interrupt time Tint. This interrupt time is the duration of a period in which an evaluation or measurement evaluation occurs once and for which a measured value or measured value pair is provided once. This may also be such that a measured value or measured value pair is provided multiple times for this interrupt time Tint. A predetermined number, for example, may be prescribed.

        "A boundary condition may also be such that the time derivative of the torsion angle at the instant \u201czero\u201d is also=\u201czero\u201d.",
        "Another alternative or supplementary boundary condition may be such that the torsion angle \u03c6(T/2) at the instant of the half period (T/2) of the juddering vibration corresponds to the rotary angle \u03c60 that would be present in a given load scenario while disregarding the juddering vibration.",
        "There may also be other boundary conditions.",
        "As a supplement or an alternative, a boundary condition may be provided such that the time derivative of the torsion angle is equal to \u201czero\u201d at the instant of the half period of the juddering vibration. In a preferred embodiment, the period of the modulation of the torque transmissible by the clutch device and/or of the clutch control travel corresponds to the half period of the juddering vibration.",
        "Preferably, the torque transmissible by the clutch device and/or the clutch control travel is modulated according to or depending on a function that has the following form:\n\na*sin(\u03c9*t),\n\na being a factor. In a preferred embodiment, this factor is determined on the basis of prescribed boundary conditions that may be such as were already mentioned within the context of this publication.",
        "Preferably, the following equation is applicable for the factor a, especially taking into account the boundary conditions:\n\na=2*\u03c92A\u03c6/\u03c0,\n\nA\u03c6 being the amplitude of the torsion angle as compared to the rotary angle \u03c60 that is or would be present if there were no juddering vibrations.",

        "In the following, several exemplary or preferred aspects of the embodiments according to the invention will explained with reference to the Figures; the invention is not to be limited hereby.",
        "Shown are:",
        "FIG. 1 is a diagrammatic illustration of the steps of an exemplary method according to the invention;",
        "FIG. 2 is a diagrammatic illustration of the steps of an exemplary method according to the invention;",
        "FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary time characteristic of the rotary speed of a transmission input shaft shown in sections;",

        "FIG. 5 is a diagrammatic illustration of the steps of an exemplary method according to the invention;",
        "FIG. 6 is a diagrammatic illustration of the steps of an exemplary method according to the invention;",
        "FIG. 7 illustrates characteristics of a torque transmissible by a clutch device over time and of the torsion angle of a drive train section over time;",
        "FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary characteristic of a clutch control travel modulation or a clutch torque modulation; and",
        "FIG. 9 illustrates an exemplary characteristic of a clutch control travel modulation or a clutch torque modulation.",
        "FIG. 1 is an exemplary method in diagrammatic illustration.",
        "In step 10, a determination is made whether juddering vibrations are present, or their presence has been detected.",
        "If juddering vibrations of this type are present, a device is adjusted in step 12 in order to counteract these juddering vibrations. This device is in particular a clutch device of a motor vehicle, such as a drive clutch. The counteraction may, for example, be such that, in the case that the device is a starting clutch of a motor vehicle, the clutch control travel or the torque transmissible by the clutch device is modulated. Such a modulation may in particular be in the form of vibration. It may also be provided, for example, that the modulation is sinusoidally formed.",
        "FIG. 2 shows the steps of an exemplary method according to the invention in diagrammatic illustration.",
        "In step 20, a value is determined for rotary speed \u03c9 of the transmission input speed in different evaluation interrupts, and a specific instant is assigned thereto.",
        "In step 22, a last occurring maximum of these rotary speed values \u03c9 of the transmission input speed is determined.",
        "It may be provided that based on this maximum or its timing position, the phase of a modulated clutch torque or a modulated clutch control travel is determined and the reference clutch torque or the reference clutch control travel is modulated accordingly.",
        "In step 24 a determination is made of whether the time interval between the last found local maximum of the transmission input speed and an actual maximum of the transmission input speed or the juddering vibration speed is present. This may in particular be such that the time interval between the last found local maximum of the transmission input speed and a local maximum of the actual clutch control travel or the actual clutch torque is determined. Other possibilities of determining this deviation may also be used.",
        "In step 26, the clutch control travel modulation that is carried out in order to counteract juddering vibrations in the drive train is changed. For this purpose, a period of the modulated travel allowance is set in such a manner that it corresponds to the old period, which is reduced by the deviation determined in step 24. This new period is used as a period for a vibration run. Next, the old period is used again for the clutch control travel modulation.",
        "Based on FIGS. 3 and 4, the steps of an exemplary method according to the invention will be explained.",
        "In FIG. 3, an exemplary, actual time characteristic of a vibrating transmission input speed or rotary or angular speed \u03c9(t) over time is shown (reference character 30).",
        "In a plurality (in this case three) of successive time interrupts TInt, the rotary speed \u03c9(t) is evaluated each time. The rotary speed values determined in this way, \u03c9i\u22121, \u03c9i=\u03c9Max and \u03c9i+1, are determined in these particular time intervals TInt and assigned to the particular time values ti\u22121, ti=tmax and ti+1.",
        "Then, the local maximum of these\u2014in this case three\u2014rotary speed values is calculated. From the comparison of the values \u03c9i\u22121, \u03c9i and \u03c9i+1, it is evident in FIG. 3 that the maximum of these three values is at \u03c9i=\u03c9max.",
        "Next, the reference clutch torque or the reference allowance for the clutch control travel is modulated, the phase of this modulation being determined as a function of the phase of the rotary speed of the transmission input shaft. In this case, an orientation to the local maximum \u03c9i=\u03c9Max occurs, so that a corresponding local extremum, especially a local maximum, of the clutch control travel is set at the appropriate place.",
        "As already indicated in FIG. 3, the actual local maximum of the rotary speed of the transmission input shaft, however, is not present at instant ti, but rather, at instant tPeak. Accordingly, the actual local maximum of the rotary speed of the transmission input shaft is not \u03c9i, but \u03c9Peak.",
        "Consequently, an actual deviation between the phase of the rotary speed of the transmission input shaft and the phase of the modulated clutch control travel is present. These relationships are clarified in FIG. 4.",
        "There, in the top half, the vibrating portion of the transmission input speed, and in the bottom half, the vibrating, modulated portion of the actual travel of the clutch servo unit are illustrated whose vibration is required by a modulation of the reference clutch control travel or of the reference clutch torque.",
        "In a second step, the timing deviation between the position of the local maximum of the transmission input speed or rotary speed of the transmission input shaft determined in the first step, and the actual position of this maximum of the transmission input speed is determined.",
        "This deviation essentially corresponds to the deviation that is calculated between the local maximum of the actual travel and the actual local maximum of the transmission input speed.",
        "To this end, different influences that place conditions on the deviation are taken into account.",
        "Then, the period of the modulated clutch control travel changes for a period by the deviation \u0394t in order to achieve a phase alignment.",
        "FIG. 5 shows the steps of an exemplary method according to the invention in diagrammatic illustration. In step 40, a calculation and/or determination is made of whether juddering vibrations are present in the drive train of a motor vehicle.",
        "In step 42, a clutch control travel modulation is started by which the juddering vibrations are to be counteracted.",
        "The modulation started in step 42 is such that a control thereafter alternates according to first and second time segments.",
        "The control in first time segments is indicated by step 44 and the control according to second time segments is indicated by step 46.",
        "In the first time segments, the clutch control travel is modulated according to the following equation:\n\nWegmod=(Ramp_up,1,Ramp_down)*Kcontrol setting*Acurrent*sin(\u03c9grabbing*y+\u03c6current),\n\nThe clutch control travel modulation is carried out as a function of a ramp function. In this example, this is (Ramp_up, 1, Ramp_down).",
        "Furthermore, it is provided that this ramp is run up at the beginning of the first time segment and is run back down at the end of the first time segment.",
        "Furthermore, in step 44 it is provided that the amplitude Acurrent is updated during the sine zero crossing based on the measured transmission input speed.",
        "Within the first time segment, the phase \u03c6current remains constant.",
        "The first time segment may have, for example, a duration of 2-3 judder periods.",
        "After the updating, a check is made of whether this judder amplitude Acurrent is smaller than a predetermined shutoff threshold.",
        "If this is the case, the method in step 48 is terminated. If this is not the case, the method is continued in step 46 after step 44 is terminated.",
        "In step 46, the modulation of the clutch control travel is interrupted so that the system may freely vibrate for a specified time. This is in particular a time that is needed and/or used to determine the phase of the vibrations. Therefore, a new phase \u03c6current is specified.",
        "The method is then continued in step 44 as a function of this newly determined phase \u03c6current.",
        "FIG. 6 shows the steps of an exemplary method according to the invention in diagrammatic illustration.",
        "In step 50, a determination is made of whether juddering vibrations are present in a drive train, or it is detected that juddering vibrations are present in the drive train of a motor vehicle.",
        "In step 42, a start is made in counteracting these juddering vibrations, and in particular via a modulation of the torque transmitted by the clutch or according to the following equation.\n\nMMod=M\u2212k*(\u03c9Clutch Disk/iGear\u2212\u03c9Wheel)",
        "In this context, the factor k is selected according to the following equation:\n\nk=[(2*d/T\u2212\u03b1)*fnom*JKS\u2212Mnom\u20140*f\u2032(S)]/f(S)",
        "In this context, it is provided that this factor k at the beginning builds up in ramp form to its target value. In this context, this ramp is such that the target value of the factor k is reached after approximately one period of judder vibration.",
        "In the top half of FIG. 7, a modulated torque 60 that is transmissible by a clutch device is depicted. The torsion angle of a predetermined drive train section 62 that is present if no torque modulation is carried out at a prescribed juddering vibration is depicted in the bottom half of FIG. 7. Furthermore, 64 of the torsion angle, which is adjusted if the torque transmissible by the clutch is modulated according to 60, is depicted in the bottom half of FIG. 7.",
        "From 62, it is obvious that in this exemplary case, the juddering vibration has an essentially sinusoidal characteristic.",
        "The modulation of the torque transmissible by the clutch device or of the clutch control travel is carried out in such a manner that amplitude 66 of a first half wave 68 is larger then the amplitude of a second half wave or a wave 70 that is not present.",
        "It may be provided that the characteristic of half wave 68 is prescribed in such a manner that, after the cycle of half wave 68 or of a corresponding clutch control travel and/or torque modulation, the juddering vibration is essentially eliminated.",
        "To this end, appropriate limit conditions may be provided on the basis of which the characteristic of the clutch torque modulation or half wave 68 is determined.",
        "In curves 62 and 64, as already mentioned, the torsion angle of a drive train section is depicted over time.",
        "The torsion angle \u03c90 essentially corresponds to the torsion angle that would be present if no juddering vibration were present in the drive train. This is therefore in particular a torsion angle that adjusts on the basis of a non-vibrating drive train load if no self-excited vibrations are present.",
        "As is evident from the bottom part of FIG. 7, curve 62 essentially vibrates around this torsion angle \u03c60.",
        "The value A\u03c6 essentially corresponds to the amplitude that the juddering vibration exerts around torsion angle \u03c60 according to curve 62.",
        "It may be provided that half wave 64 corresponds to a function that essentially may be expressed as \u201c\u2212a*sin(\u03c9*t).",
        "The characteristic of juddering vibration 62, for example may be expressed by\n\nd2\u03c6/dt+\u03c92*\u03c6=m0=constant\n\nIn this context, m0 represents a constant, while \u03c6 represents the torsion angle and d2\u03c6/dt represents the second derivative of the torsion angle.",
        "Boundary conditions may be set here, such as a boundary condition \u03c6(0)=0\u2212A\u03c6and [d\u03c6/dt](0)=0 and \u03c6(T/2=\u03c60 and [d\u03c6/dt](T/2)=0). In this way, exemplary conditions are established in this embodiment that are to be present at instants \u201c0\u201d or \u201cT/2\u201d.",
        "Based on these boundary conditions and these characteristics, in this example factor a of the torque modulation may be calculated. In this example\u2014because the torque modulation is supposed to counteract the juddering vibration, that is, in this case\n\nd2\u03c6/dt+\u03c92*\u03c6=m0\u2212a*sin(\u03c9*t)\n\nis applicable\u2014this yields\n\na=2*\u03c92A\u03c6/\u03c0",
        "As characteristic 64 in FIG. 7 shows, with an appropriate selection of a, the juddering vibration is essentially eliminated after a half wave (T/2) of this juddering vibration, or the torsion angle of the drive train section essentially corresponds to torsion angle \u03c60.",
        "FIGS. 8 and 9 show two exemplary characteristics of a modulated clutch torque over time in sections. Such a modulated clutch torque may be used in order to counteract juddering vibrations in a drive train.",
        "It should be noted that the time axis that is represented in FIGS. 8 and 9 is displaced in the vertical direction.",
        "In FIGS. 8 and 9, characteristic 80 of the modulated clutch torque has a first half shaft 82 and a second half wave 84.",
        "Amplitude 86 of first half wave 82 is greater than amplitude 88 of second half wave 84. This also becomes clear based on an additional hypothetical half wave 90 depicted in FIGS. 8 and 9, whose theoretical amplitude essentially corresponds to that of first half wave 82. This half wave 90 is shown for comparison, although in another embodiment of the invention a second half wave may also be like this, like that of half wave 90.",
        "Double arrow 92 indicates that the characteristic of second half wave 82 may also be different, the amplitude of second half wave 84 in particular being changed.",
        "The embodiments according to FIGS. 8 and 9 are distinguished in particular by the inward or outward run of the particular half waves 82, 84 of the vibrations.",
        "In FIG. 8 takeoff 94, which is present at the beginning of the period, is essentially such that the time axis or a line parallel to the time axis is placed essentially in the form of a tangent to the takeoff or the modulated clutch torque, as is shown in region 96.",
        "In a corresponding manner, the modulated clutch torque according to FIG. 8 runs out at the end of the period in such a manner that the time axis or a line parallel to the time axis is placed essentially in the form of a tangent to runout 98 or the modulated clutch torque, as is shown in region 100.",
        "In the design according to FIG. 9, the takeoff 94 or the runout 98 at the beginning or end of a period is formed differently, and specifically such that the time axis or an axis parallel thereto is disposed at an angle to the particular tangent in the region of takeoff run 94 or runout 98. This is shown in regions 102 and 104."
