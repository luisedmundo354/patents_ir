In embodiments, the amount of photogenerating pigment and the amount of electron transport selected can each be adjusted to, for example, permit the photosensitivity tuneability of the photogenerating layer.

Also, when a blocking layer is present, especially a thick layer of, for example, from about 1 to about 20 microns, there can be achieved a reduction in the residual voltage caused primarily by the diffusion/penetration of the electron transport component from the photogenerating layer into the blocking layer thereby improving the electron mobility of the blocking layer. Moreover, in embodiments when the photogenerating layer contains the electron transport component there is permitted, for example, thicker photogenerating layers while maintaining relatively high pigment concentrations such that much of the light absorption is accomplished at the top, from about 2 to about 5 microns, and which layer may also minimize charge deficient spots and may allow improvements in the preparation of the members and the coating robustness thereof.

        "The devices of Example I were electrically tested with a cyclic scanner set to obtain 100 charge-erase cycles immediately followed by an additional 100 cycles, sequences at 2 charge-erase cycles and 1 charge-expose-erase cycle, wherein the light intensity was incrementally increased with cycling to produce a photoinduced discharge curve from which the photosensitivity was measured. The scanner was equipped with a single wire corotron (5 centimeters wide) set to deposit 100 nanocoulombs/cm2 of charge on the surface of the drum devices. The devices of Example I were tested in the negative charging mode. The exposure light intensity was incrementally increased by means of regulating a series of neutral density filters, and the exposure wavelength was controlled by a band filter at 780\u00b15 nanometers. The exposure light source was 1,000 watt Xenon arc lamp white light source. The dark discharge of the photoreceptor was measured by monitoring the surface potential for 7 seconds after a single charge cycle of 100 nanocoulombs/cm2 (without erase). Photosensitivity (dV/dx) was calculated from the initial discharge rate at low exposure intensity, determined at about 70 percent of the initial voltage (about 0 to about 0.7 erg/cm2 exposure).",

        "Devices 1 and 2 of Example I demonstrate the selective tuning of photosensitivity where, for example, as the loading of pigment decreases the sensitivity of the photoreceptor decreases, but the residual voltage does not concomitantly increase since the necessary mobility was maintained by the introduction of the electron transport (ETM). As the concentration of pigment was decreased from 40 percent to 20 percent, it was replaced by ETM to facilitate the transport of electrons in the charge generating layer (CGL). The diffusion of the charge transporting small molecules from the CTL into the CGL as a result of the coating process enabled efficient charge injection into the charge, especially hole, transport layer (CTL). The concomitant decrease in the dark discharge voltage was commensurate with the decreased pigment loading. A comparison of Device 1 with Comparative Device 2 (prepared with a slightly higher pigment loading in the same binder system) demonstrated the transport advantage obtained from the addition of the electron transporting material, which resulted in lowering the residual voltage while the photosensitivity remained constant.",

        "An imaging member was prepared by providing a 0.02 micrometer thick titanium layer coated on a biaxially oriented polyethylene naphthalate substrate (KALEDEX\u2122 2000) having a thickness of 3.5 mils, and applying thereon with a gravure applicator, a hole blocking layer solution containing 50 grams of 3-amino-propyltriethoxysilane, 41.2 grams of water, 15 grams of acetic acid, 684.8 grams of 200 proof denatured alcohol and 200 grams of heptane.

The adhesive layer was then dried for about 5 minutes at 135\u00b0 C. in the forced air dryer of the coater. The resulting adhesive layer had a dry thickness of 200 Angstroms.",

To this solution were added 2.4 grams of hydroxygallium phthalocyanine Type V and 300 grams of \u215b inch (3.2 millimeter) diameter stainless steel shot. This mixture was then placed on a ball mill for about 20 to about 24 hours. Subsequently, 1.71 grams of PC-Z 500, 0.672 gram of N,N\u2032-bis-(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-4,4\u2032-biphenyl amine charge transport molecules (HTM) and 0.168 gram of 4-n-butoxycarbonyl-9-fluorenylidene malononitrile electron transporting material (ETM) were dissolved in 22 grams of tetrahydrofuran, and then added to 19.26 grams of the Type V OHGaPc slurry. This slurry was then rolled to mix without milling media overnight, about 18 to 20 hours. The resulting slurry was, thereafter, applied to the adhesive interface with a Bird applicator to form a charge generation layer. The charge generation layer was dried at 120\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes in a forced air oven to form a dry charge generation layer with a final dry thickness of about 3 microns. This imaging member web was overcoated with a charge transport layer in contact with the charge generation layer.

The resulting mixture was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran to form a solution containing 15 percent by weight solids. This solution was applied on the charge generation layer to form a charge transport layer coating with a final dry thickness of about 17 \u03bcm.

Note that devices F to J have similar characteristics to the Comparative Device 3 which has a higher pigment:binder ratio. The dark decay and residual voltage were slightly higher for device E indicating that the ratio of the active transport materials (HTM, ETM) and pigment to the binder was of value to, for example, maintain acceptable discharge characteristics including a low residual voltage and low dark decay while maintaining excellent photosensitivity as indicated. The photoinduced discharge characteristics indicate that as the binder ratio was increased (pigment loading remaining constant), sufficient transport occurred within the charge generation layers, while the devices also exhibited excellent charge injection at both the undercoat and transport layer interfaces.",
