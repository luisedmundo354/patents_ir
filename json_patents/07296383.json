        "This application is continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/456,439, filed Jun. 6, 2003, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/392,320, filed Jun. 27, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,968,656.",
        "The present invention relates to a decorative building shutter for mounting on a wall surface. More specifically, the present invention relates to an improved plastic batten shutter.",
        "Decorative building panels, such as shutters, are widely used in the building industry to add character to a house or other type of building structure. Additionally, decorative building panels are frequently installed on existing structures to change the appearance of the structure. A popular type of building panel that is used is a window shutter. These shutters, which are typically not functional, present a decorative facade that gives the appearance of being a functional shutter.",
        "One popular style of shutter is commonly referred to as a batten shutter. The batten shutter includes a plurality of batten slats or boards arranged vertically in a row. At least one, and usually two, cross slats overlay each of the batten slats. The cross slats adjoin the batten slats forming the batten shutter assembly. A simulated plastic batten shutter commonly includes slats having a decorative surface and flanges projecting rearward from the surface creating a hollow slat that gives the appearance of being a complete wooden slat. While the plastic materials reduce the cost of producing the batten shutter, connecting the slats together is a labor intensive and costly operation.",
        "One such example is U.S. Pat. No. 4,184,300 to Deschamps. Deschamps discloses a batten shutter having plastic batten slats with decorative surface and side flanges. Each batten slat is affixed to a cross slat with pin. Utilizing pins to connect the batten slats to the cross slats adds cost and assembly time due to the increased number of parts required for assembly.",
        "Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a batten shutter that is simple to produce and yet presents the appearance of being assembled from real wood.",
        "The present invention discloses a decorative shutter assembly having a plurality of batten slats arranged in a row and connected together by at least one cross slat. Each batten slat presents a batten decorative surface having side batten flanges projecting rearward. Each cross slat overlays the batten slats and presents a decorative cross surface with side cross flanges projecting rearward. Each cross slat includes at least one mating member affixed behind the cross-decorative surface with a mating wall affixed to each of the batten decorative surfaces. The slats are affixed to the mating member by sonic welding or heat welding. Each of the slats includes end plugs at each end to present a finished appearance of being a complete wooden board.",
        "The inventive batten shutter provides a simple design that is easily produced and presents the appearance of being made from wooden boards. The mating member maximizes the amount of extrusion processing that can be utilized enabling a single extruder to be used for both the cross slats and the batten slats by providing a mating surface to the batten slats. Further, hiding the mating surface behind the cross slat provides the ability to form an attachment point from either a sonic weld or a heat weld.",
        "Other advantages of the present invention will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein:",

The base wall 56 is affixed to the rear cross surface 55 of the cross slat 16 and the mating wall 48 is affixed to each of the batten decorative surfaces 20 thereby affixing the plurality batten slats 14 to at least one cross slat 16. In one embodiment, the assembly 10 will include one less mating member 18 than the number of batten slats 14. Thus, each mating member 18 will straddle adjacent batten slats 14 as is best represented in FIG. 2.",
        "Each mating member 18 is affixed to the cross slat 16 and to the batten slats 14 by the plurality of apertures or mating attachment points 52. The attachment points 52 may comprise sonic welds. Alternatively, the attachment points 52 comprise heat welds. Generally, sonic welds will be utilized when making an attachment point 52 to a visible decorative surface 20, 30.",
        "It should be noted that the decorative shutter assembly may have any number of batten slats 14, e.g., four. Each cross slat 16 includes the mating member 18 and the first front plane 20.",
        "The batten slats 14 include the batten decorative surface 20. Each batten slat 14 also includes two side flanges 36 and two end flanges 40. The two side flanges 36 and the two end flanges 40 define an batten interior volume on an opposite side of the batten decorative surface 20.",
        "In one embodiment, the batten slats 14 are manufactured in predetermined lengths, e.g., 60 inches. In order to assembly a shutter assembly 10 having an overall length other than 60 inches, one or more batten slats 14 may be cut such that their combines length equals the desired length. As discussed below, the end flange(s) 40 of the cross slat(s) 16 may be used to hide the seam 28 or joint between the two batten slats 14.",
        "Each mating member 18 includes a plurality of regularly repeating reinforced structural sections 46. The number of sections 46 correspond directly to the number of batten slats 14 in the assembled shutter assembly 10. For example, the mating member 18 includes three sections 46 corresponding to the three slats 14 shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. Each mating member 18 includes the regularly repeating reinforced structural sections 46 and the ribs 50 formed with and rising from the planar portion or back wall 48. The sections 46 are formed by mating member side flanges 49, mating member end flanges 51, plurality of ribs 50 and the back wall 48.",
        "The back wall 48 includes at least one large aperture 52. The back wall 48 also includes at least two smaller apertures 53 in each section 46. The large aperture 52 is used to assist in separating the first front plane or top cover 20 and the mating member 18.",
        "To assemble the shutter assembly 10, the mating members 18 are affixed to the batten slats 14 by a suitable process, such as sonic welding, heat welds, or by using a suitable fastener such as a clip, a screw, or the like. The smaller apertures 53 may be formed during the fastening process.",
        "The top cover 30 of the cross slat 16 includes the cross decorative surface 30, two side flanges 36 and two end flanges 40. The two side flanges 36 and the two end flanges 40 define a cross batten interior volume.",
        "In one embodiment, the cross slats 16 includes the locking mechanism 38 which is used to removably lock the top cover 20 to its corresponding mating member 18 when the decorative shutter assembly 10 is assembled The top cover 20 and the corresponding mating member 18 may also be assembled in a non-locking position pre-assembly, e.g., during shipping (see below).",
        "The locking mechanism 38 includes the first notch 42 and second notch 44 located on an interior surface of each side flanges 36. In the illustrated embodiment, the notches 42, 44 are located on each side flange 36. Each notch 42, 44 is directly across from the corresponding locking mechanism or tab 38 on the inner surface of the opposing side flange 36. Each tab 38 is offset from the end flange 40 by a predetermined distance. For example, the tabs 38 on the left in FIGS. 6B and 6B are offset from the end flange 40 by a distance of \u201cX\u201d. The tabs 38 in the right in FIGS. 6B and 6B are offset from the end flange 40 by a distance if \u201cY\u201d. X and Y are not equal.",
        "Each mating member 18 includes the second notch 44 corresponding to each tab 38. Each notch 44 includes a channel portion 60 and a locking portion 62 (see FIG. 7B). The locking portions 62 are adjacent the corresponding channel portion 60. The locking portions 62 are offset from a respective mating member end flange 40 by a distance of X\u2032, Y\u2032. X\u2032and Y\u2032 are not equal.",
        "As discussed above, the top cover 30 of each cross slat 16 may be assembled with the mating member 18 in either a locking position or a slidably removable position. In the illustrated embodiment, the locking position is defined when one of the side flanges 36 is oriented with a predetermined one of the mating member side flanges 49. The slidably removable position is defined when the top cover 20 is assembled 180 degrees from the locking position.",
        "When the top cover 30 and the mating member 18 are assembled in the slidably removable or non-locking position, each tab 38 is maintained within a respective channel portion 60. Thus, the top cover 20 is able to slide from on and off.",
        "When the top cover 32 and the mating member 18\u2032 are assembled in the locked position, each tab 38 is aligned with a corresponding locking portion 60. When fully assembled each tab 38 is maintained in position by the corresponding locking portion 60, and thus, the top cover 20 and the mating member 18 are \u201clocked\u201d. It should be noted that although the top cover 20 and the mating member 18 are locked, the top cover 20 may be removed from the mating member 18 by flexing the side flanges 36 such that the tabs 38 are disengaged from the locking portions 60.",
        "In an alternative embodiment, a cross slat 14 includes a top cover 20 and a mating member 18\u2032 for use in a shutter assembly having four batten slats or boards.",
        "If the shutter assembly 10 length must be composed of portions of one or more batten slats 14, the seam is hidden by the cross slat 16. Furthermore, the cross slat end flanges extend past the side flanges 36 to cover the seam 28 in the side flanges 14.",
