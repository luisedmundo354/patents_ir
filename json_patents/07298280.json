It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1, a representation of a fluid flow monitor or fluid flow indicator 10 is shown. Fluid flow monitor 10 includes a housing 12 having an inlet coupler 14, an outlet coupler 16, and a fluid passage 18. Fluid passage 18 connects inlet coupler 14 and outlet coupler 16 in fluid communication such that fluid introduced at fluid inlet coupler 14 may be passed to fluid outlet coupler 16. Inlet coupler 14 and outlet coupler 16 are each configured to be coupled to an external device such as a conduit, a single lumen cannula, a fluid flow regulator, a source of regulated fluid, and other fluid transporting, utilizing, and/or delivery devices. In one example, inlet coupler 14 and/or outlet coupler 16 include a hose barb configured to receive a section of conduit or tubing. In another example, inlet coupler 14 and/or outlet coupler 16 include a threaded portion, such as an exterior threaded portion, the threaded portion sized to be received by a mating threaded portion on an external device. The above two examples are examples of removable couplers. In still a further example, input coupler and/or output coupler are permanently coupled to an external device by welding, with an adhesive, or other means.",
        "Fluid flow monitor 10 further includes a sensor 20 and an indicator 22. As explained in more detail herein, sensor 20 is in fluid communication with fluid passage 18 and senses the pressure and/or flow of fluid in fluid passage 18. In one example, sensor 20 is a mechanical sensor, such as a diaphragm or a piston. In another example, sensor 20 is an electrical sensor, such as a temperature measuring resistor or electrical transducer.",
        "Sensor 20 in one embodiment includes a flow sensor which provides a measurement of the flow rate of fluid in fluid passage 18. Sensor 20 in another embodiment includes a pressure sensor which provides a measurement of the fluid pressure in fluid passage 18.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, input coupler is connected to a source of fluid, such as oxygen gas, outlet coupler 16 is coupled to a single lumen cannula which is positioned to provide fluid, such as oxygen gas, to the nostrils of a patient. Since the single lumen cannula is not capped, but is constantly permitting oxygen gas to escape to the nostrils of the patient a pressure sensor can be used to give an indication of fluid flow in the fluid passage 18 and to determine if the cannula has been disconnected from fluid monitor 10, if fluid monitor 10 has been disconnected from the fluid source, or if pressure in the fluid passage has dropped below a predetermined level due to a leak or pressure drop in the fluid supply. Assuming the gas delivery system, the single lumen cannula and fluid source, are operating correctly, the pressure sensor should expect to detect a pressure determined by calculating the back pressure expected due to the single lumen cannula and the expected flow rate from the fluid source.

        "In step 404, controller 302 reads the input to determine the state of pressure sensing switch 334. The step of reading the input includes reading the value of Port B Bit 6 followed by a second reading of Port B Bit 6 (\u201cDeBounce\u201d). If the input is high at block 406, indicating that the pressure in the respective fluid passage is low (the gas delivery system is operating improperly), controller 302 executes a time for alarm routine 408.

It should be appreciated that as long as the input at block 406 is low the flash LED routine 410 will be repeated, thus simulating a flashing LED. Also, in one example the separation between flashes and the duration of each flash are chosen to maximize battery life.",
        "As stated above, circuit 300 is configured to wait for a predetermined time before sounding an alarm condition. This delay is implemented with time for alarm routine 408. Once a high condition is read on the input at block 406, time for alarm routine 408 is executed. As represented by step 418, a counter is incremented. Next, the input is read again, as represented by block 420. If the value of the counter exceeds a threshold number (the threshold being set based on the delay desired), then an alarm routine 422 is executed, as represented by block 424.

        "Returning to FIG. 2, housing seal 124 is illustratively a rubber annular element configured to be compressed between inlet housing 114 and outlet housing 112 when the housings 112,114 are threadably engaged.

Threaded portion 162 is configured to engage threaded portion 134 of inlet housing 114, 116 to, along with housing seal 124, provide a fluid tight housing. Barbed end 132 receives a piece of plastic tubing/cannula 128 thereon as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4.",
        "In use, inlet housing 116 is connected to a cannula 128 (FIG. 3) or inlet housing 114 is connected to a regulator 126 (FIG. 4) and outlet housing 112 is connected to a cannula 128 which is in turn connected to a fluid utilizing device or fluid dispensing device 166. Once fluid flow is introduced to the cannula 128 or regulator 126 connected to input 131, pressure is applied to diaphragm 122. Diaphragm 122 is then deflected or biased from the first position to the second position such that conductive pad 146 moves toward circuit board 154 to engage contact 158 and complete circuit 118. Completing circuit 118 causes LED 152 to receive power from batteries 120 and emit light. Furthermore, distortion of the diaphragm 122 allows fluid to flow from input 131, around diaphragm 122 and circuit 118, to outlet 164. If fluid flow stops, or drops below a predetermined pressure, diaphragm 122 moves back to first position causing pad 146 to move away from contact 158, thereby opening circuit 118. The position of diaphragm 122 is dictated by the pressure developed therebehind.",
        "While the present invention has been described as using circuit gap between contact 158 and conductive pad 146, it should be appreciated that other switch mechanism such as a piston that activates a switch or any other switching mechanism known in the art may be used. It is also envisioned to use different colored LED's 152 to indicate different gases. The placement of LED 152 within housing 111 allows light from LED 152 to be seen by a user. LED 152 light can be seen if housing 111 is transparent or translucent or if the light from LED 152 travels down a transparent/translucent outlet cannula 128.",
        "In yet another embodiment, fluid flow indicator 110 includes a flow meter 168 as shown in FIG. 6. Flow meter 168 is preferably includes a digital readout 170 that displays the fluid flow speed. Flow meters which measure flow rate through a tube are generally known. Alternatively, the rate at which LED 152 flashes or a change in color of LED 152 may be used to indicate the fluid flow speed. Also, while the invention has been described as activating an indicator when fluid flow is present, embodiments are envisioned where indicators such as lights or buzzers are activated upon loss of fluid flow or fluid pressure. Such an embodiment is shown in FIG. 5.",
        "The embodiment of FIG. 5 shows an indicator or monitor 200 such that an alarm sounds when indicator 200 becomes un-attached from the fluid source or a significant amount of fluid is escaping, or pressure in the fluid supply drops below a predetermined level. Pressure within a flow path 202 is translated to a diaphragm 204 similarly as it was for indicator 110. However, in FIG. 5, a conductive pad 246 is in a fixed position and normally engaged with a contact 258 on diaphragm 204 when diaphragm is in its first, unbiased position shown in FIG. 5. Pressure within flow path 202 distorts diaphragm 204 moves contact 258 away from pad 246 to de-activate circuit 206. However, distorted diaphragm 204 does not allow the passage of the gas thereby. The gas is maintained beneath diaphragm 204. A loss of pressure in flow path 202 results in diaphragm 204 returning to its first, rest position and activating circuit 206 that in turn activates an indicator such as an LED 208 or a buzzer. Thus, a lack of connection to the fluid source, a leak in the system, or drop in pressure of the source will visually or sonically alert the user. The embodiment of FIG. 5 may be used concurrently with the embodiment of FIG. 1.",
        "The back pressure indicator 200 of FIG. 5 is preferably mounted as close as possible to the regulator, because it relies on tubing restriction for proper operation. Typical tubing restrictions range from three to 15 inches of water. The electrical circuit is designed to give a battery life of about 28 days of continuous operation per set of batteries. This is accomplished with the use of short duty cycles and careful circuit design to minimize current consumption. In one embodiment, the back pressure indicator 200 emits a pattern of beeps for 3 minutes (or other preselected time) after the gas pressure is lost or until the gas pressure is restored. If the beeper timer has passed three minutes, the unit will not beep, until the gas has been restored. (Light operates.)",
        "Other features of the invention include having LED 152, 208 flash at a first speed to indicate that the fluid flow is normal and flash at a second speed to indicate that fluid flow is abnormal. In another system, LED's 152, 208 flash at a certain speed and are detected by an alarm system that determines the speed or existence of flashing LED 152, 208 and alerts appropriate individuals upon noting an abnormal signal. Likewise, a preferably wireless transmitter may be placed in circuits 118, 206 to transmit signals to an alarm system in a facility.

Further conductive pad 540 is replaced with a pad 805 having a surface 806 which is at least partially colored.",
        "In operation, when the pressure in the fluid passage (not shown) is below the threshold value (gas delivery system is not operating properly), diaphragm 804 is in a relaxed position and colored surface 806 is spaced apart from a focus 810 of collimating lens 802. When the pressure in the fluid passage (not shown) is at or above the threshold value (gas delivery system is operating properly), diaphragm 804 is in a biased position and colored surface 806 (shown in phantom) is generally located at focus 810 of collimating lens 802. When colored surface 806 is at focus 810, an observer from the opposite side of lens 802 (outside of the housing) will see a large, if not full view image of colored surface 806. When colored surface 806 is spaced apart from focus 810, an observer of the opposite side of lens 802 will see a small or no image of colored surface 806.",
        "In a preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 22, a kit 900 is provided including a package 902 containing a single lumen cannula 904, a fluid flow monitor 906, and an instructional information 308. Single lumen cannula 904 and fluid flow monitor 906 are each sterilized for use with a patient. The sterilized single lumen cannula 904 and fluid flow monitor 906 are sealed in package 902 along with instructional information 908. Package 902 in one example is hated sealed along two edges to enclose the single lumen cannula 904, fluid flow monitor 906 and instruction information 908. In one example, instructional information 908 is provided on an information sheet or pamphlet either placed inside package 902 with single lumen cannula 902 and fluid flow monitor 904 or attached to an exterior of package 902. In another example, instructional information is printed onto a surface of package 902. It should be appreciated that kit 900 provides a caregiver with a disposable system for delivering oxygen to a patient with a disposable single lumen cannula 902 and monitoring the delivery of oxygen to the patient with a disposable fluid flow monitor 904. Fluid flow monitor 904, in one example, may be one of fluid flow monitors 10,110, 200, 500, 600, 700, and 800.",
