        "This application claims benefit of Japanese Application No. 2000-326522 filed in Japan on Oct. 26, 2000, Japanese Application No. 2001-019044 filed in Japan on Jan. 26, 2001, the contents of which are incorporated by this reference.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an image-pickup apparatus, or more particularly, an image-pickup apparatus capable of substantially reproducing an image obtainable with a wide dynamic range.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Various types of image-pickup apparatus for electrically producing an object image have been proposed in the past. In a digital still camera that is one type of image-pickup apparatus, a solid-state image-pickup device converts a light image, which is converged on a surface of the solid-state image-pickup device through a lens, into electric information and thus produces an image.",
        "The solid-state image-pickup device incorporated in the digital still camera can produce many pixels at present and can therefore produce an image of a higher resolution. However, since the image-pickup device can offer only a very narrow dynamic range, a resultant image suffers from a narrow latitude (a range of reproduced brightness levels from a highlight to a shadow).",
        "What is essential to reproduce an image despite the narrow dynamic range is an automatic exposure setting (AE) facility that properly determines a condition for exposure optimal to a photographic scene (exposure time (shutter speed) or an f-number). Some proposals have been made for a technology of reproducing an image using the AE facility in the past.",
        "As an example of such a technology, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 6-38092 describes a technology concerning a video camera that can properly determine a condition for exposure and a photometry method employed in the camera. More particularly, according to the technology, when a value calculated by integrating luminance values that are specified in image information acquired for a photometric period within a horizontal scanning period is judged to fall within a predetermined range, photometry is performed based on the value. Furthermore, the patent unexamined publication describes that if the number of times by which the value calculated by integrating the luminance values is judged to fall outside the predetermined range exceeds a predetermined value, the condition for exposure is changed.",
        "In order to acquire image information, which is obtainable with a wide dynamic range, from a solid-state image-pickup device suffering a narrow dynamic range, exposure is performed a plurality of times with an exposure level varied. This technology is well known.",
        "The foregoing technologies will be described with reference to FIG. 19A, FIG. 19B, and FIG. 19C that show a photographic scene whose objects having a difference in luminance are exposed with an exposure level varied and which is thus exposed a plurality of times.",
        "FIG. 19A shows a photographic scene having a figure, which is a dark major object, located nearly in the center of a background that is bright scenery. In order to pick up an image of the scenery using a solid-state image-pickup device that suffers a narrow dynamic range, exposure is performed with an exposure level lowered so that the background will appear more distinctly as shown in FIG. 19B. Moreover, exposure is performed with the exposure level raised so that the figure will appear more distinctly as shown in FIG. 19C. The background portion of the image shown in FIG. 19B and the figure portion of the image shown in FIG. 19C are combined in order to produce an image obtainable with a wide dynamic range. The image obtainable with a wide dynamic range shows both the background and figure distinctly.",
        "Even when the foregoing technology of performing exposure a plurality of times is used to produce an image obtainable with a wide dynamic range, the AE facility plays a significant role in reproducing an optimal image. Specifically, when a scene which requires a wide dynamic range and in which a dark major object (figure) and a bright background coexist as shown in FIG. 19A, FIG. 19B, and FIG. 19C is imaged, the major object and background alike must be imaged while being exposed optimally.",
        "Some technologies have been proposed for controlling photographing according to a photographic scene, which requires a wide dynamic range, so that both a major object and a background can be exposed optimally. For example, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 7-298142 describes an image-pickup apparatus that has a gray scale control facility. The gray scale control facility properly exposes both a major object and a background contained in a backlit photographic scene. To be more specific, the technology described in the patent unexamined publication requires a gray scale control means that switches timings, which set storing time of light information, according to whether a luminance value specified in image information indicates a high-luminance point or a low-luminance point.",
        "Moreover, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 11-205661 describes a means that synthesizes a long-time exposure image produced under the predetermined condition for exposure, and a short-time exposure image produced while being exposed for a shorter exposure time. The means adjusts a ratio of exposure levels according to the position of a peak level point in a synthetic image.",
        "However, according to the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 6-38092, if the number of times by which a value calculated by integrating luminance information falls outside a predetermined range exceeds a predetermined value, a condition for exposure is changed. Thereafter, photometry is performed in the same manner. As long as the scene shown in FIG. 19A, FIG. 19B, and FIG. 19C is concerned, after an initial condition for exposure is changed, it must be judged whichever of a bright point and a dark point should be subjected to photometry. Furthermore, according to the means, the condition for exposure under which either the bright point or dark point is imaged is optimized, and the condition for exposure under which the other point is imaged remains improper.",
        "Moreover, according to the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 7-298142, in order to produce an image that enjoys excellent reproducibility, information concerning a photographic scene must be read from a solid-state image-pickup device or the like all the time. This results in an increase of power consumption. Furthermore, when photographing is performed a plurality of times with an exposure level varied, information of a bright point and information of a dark point must be read independently of each other. Based on the read information, control must be extended so that both the bright and dark points will be imaged properly all the time. This may lead to a larger amount of consumed power compared with an amount normally consumed power.",
        "As a measure to be taken for lightening a load imposed on the AE facility, a means is conceivable. Namely, the AE facility is used to control exposure of either a major object or a background. The other of the controlled major object or background is exposed at a fixed exposure ratio. If an exposure ratio is thus fixed, the AE facility can be designed similarly to that adopted for a typical digital still camera.",
        "However, a backlit state in which a major object and a background are distinguished from each other includes various cases. If brightness changes moderately between the major object and background, photographing may fail. Moreover, if a difference in brightness is as large as a difference in brightness between a dark indoor and a bright outdoor is, a scene may not be reproduced with an exposure ratio set to a value permissible for imaging of a normally backlit scene.",
        "Furthermore, the condition for exposure under which one of bright and dark points is photographed may not be determined using the AE facility, and the condition for exposure under which the other point is photographed may not be determined using a fixed ratio. Instead, a means enabling a user to designate an exposure time and an exposure ratio is conceivable. However, a user may have difficulty in judging a proper exposure time or exposure ratio according to a difference in brightness. But for a certain experience or knowledge, it may be hard to judge what exposure time or exposure ratio is optimal. The means is therefore unpractical.",
        "In addition, a means is conceivable for preparing a plurality of exposure settings in association with photographic scenes, and allowing a user to select any of the exposure settings. However, a user who does not have for a certain experience or knowledge may have difficulty in subjectively judging from a difference in brightness or the like what exposure setting is optimal for an actual photographic scene. The means cannot therefore be said to be practical.",
        "According to the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 7-298142, when exposure is performed a plurality of times with an exposure level varied, a high-luminance point and a low-luminance point are specified manually in units of each of blocks into which an image field is divided. It is not clearly described how to automatically identify the high-luminance point and low-luminance point. Besides, how to identify the high-luminance point and low-luminance point after photographic scenes are changed is not clarified.",
        "Moreover, according to the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 11-205661, the long exposure-time image and short exposure-time image are produced under the predetermined condition for exposure. If the levels of a signal representing an object do not fall within the range from the level of the signal representing the long exposure-time image to the level of the signal representing the short exposure-time image, an incorrect peak level may be detected. This poses a problem in that the ratio of exposure levels is not calculated properly.",
        "Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an image-pickup apparatus capable of properly photographing even a photographic scene, which exhibits a large difference in brightness and contains an object that exhibits a brightness range comparable to an arbitrary dynamic range, without the necessity of driving an AE facility all the time. The image-pickup apparatus can thus reproduce an image that requires a wide dynamic range.",
        "Another object of the present invention is to provide an image-pickup apparatus capable of automatically determining a condition for exposure optimal to a dynamic range comparable to a brightness range exhibited by a photographic scene. Consequently, the image-pickup apparatus can reproduce an image that exhibits a brightness range comparable to the dynamic range required by the photographic scene.",
        "Briefly, according to the present invention, there is provided an image-pickup apparatus consisting mainly of an information acquiring means, an analyzing means, a conditions-for-photographing setting means, and a photographing means. The information acquiring means acquires information concerning a dynamic range, which is required to photograph a photographic scene, with a condition for exposure varied before performing actual photographing. The analyzing means analyzes the information acquired by the information acquiring means. The conditions-for-photographing setting means sets the conditions for actual photographing according to the result of the analysis performed by the analyzing means. The photographing means performs actual photographing under the actual photographing conditions set by the conditions-for-photographing setting means.",

        "A digital still camera shown in FIG. 1 employs an image-pickup device 1 that is a single-plate color CCD or the like having an electronic shutter facility. An object image is converged on the image-pickup device 1 via a lens 2 and a diaphragm/shutter mechanism 3. The object image is photoelectrically converted and transmitted as an image signal. The image signal representing the object image and being transmitted from the image-pickup device 1 has a noise component thereof removed by a correlative double sampling circuit or the like that is not shown. The resultant signal is amplified by an amplifier 4, digitized by an A/D converter 5, and transferred to a camera signal processing circuit 6. The camera signal processing circuit 6 processes the signal as image data.",
        "An output of the A/D converter 5 is transferred to an AF/AE/AWB wave detecting circuit 7 and a shutter timing control circuit 21. The AF/AE/AWB wave detecting circuit 7 performs AF wave detection to acquire AF-related information that is needed to automatically control the focus of the camera prior to actual photographing. The AF/AE/AWB wave detecting circuit 7 also performs AE wave detection to acquire AE-related information that is needed to automatically control exposure. Moreover, the AF/AE/AWB wave detecting circuit 7 performs AWB wave detection to acquire AWB-related information that is needed to automatically set a white balance. The AF-related information, AE-related information, and AWB-related information are transferred to a CPU 8 that is a control means.

During the pre-photographing, a photographic scene is sequentially photographed according to the shutter timings ST1, ST2, and ST3 respectively. Image values (luminance values) acquired are transferred to the signal synthesizing circuit 32 via the A/D converter 5.",
        "The signal synthesizing circuit 32 that is an information synthesizing means synthesizes the received image values for three image fields in accordance with the exposure levels attained for photographing, and produces luminance information obtainable with a wide dynamic range.

The shutter timing signal is also transferred to the CPU 8 as data for use in controlling the strobe, whereby an amount of flashlight to be emitted from the strobe 19 is controlled in proportion to the shutter speed indicated by the shutter timing signal. Actual photographing is then performed.",
        "In the shutter timing calculation LUT 36, the shutter timing signals that permit proper exposure are stored in association with luminance levels.",
        "Operation to be performed in the photographic scene dependent photographing mode will be described with reference to FIG. 3 to FIG. 7.",
        "FIG. 3 is a flowchart describing the operation to be performed in the photographic scene dependent photographing mode. In the photographic scene dependent photographing mode, first, the shutter timing signals ST1, ST2, and ST3 are read from the shutter timing ROM 24 (step S1). Based on the shutter timing signals ST1, ST2, and ST3, the timing generator 18 is driven in order to perform pre-photographing (step S2). Image values (luminance values) for three image fields are acquired with an exposure level varied (step S3). Incidentally, pre-photographing is started at step S2 by, for example, pressing a release switch halfway.",
        "When pre-photographing is completed, the signal synthesizing circuit 32 synthesizes the luminance information of the images based on the exposure levels attained for pre-photographing, and produces luminance information obtainable with a wide dynamic range (step S4).",
        "Assume that a photographic scene contains, as shown in FIG. 4A, a backlit scene containing a figure that is a dark major object and a bright background, and exhibits a brightness distribution shown in FIG. 4B. In this case, the photographic scene is pre-photographed with the shutter timing signals ST1, ST2, and ST3. The luminance information acquired in response to the shutter timing signals are matched to the exposure levels attained during pre-photographing. This results in photographic scene information shown in FIG. 5. Luminance values relevant to the same exposure level or brightness level are weighted with a coefficient proportional to the brightness level, and then added up. All the luminance values are then synthesized at step S4, whereby luminance information acquirable with a wide dynamic range is produced.",
        "For example, assume that a luminance information acquired by performing pre-photographing with each shutter timing signal is expressed with 8 bits. In this case, the shutter timing signals ST1, ST2, and ST3 are determined so that luminance information acquired in response to two adjoining shutter timing signals and related to the same exposure level will be 2 bits long. Information of 20 bits long (approximately 120 dB) can be acquired as a result.",
        "In reality, a photographic scene exhibiting such a large difference in brightness as to be expressed with luminance information of 20 bits long is exceptional. For example, assuming that luminance values related to the same exposure level are 4 bits long, luminance information of 16 bits long (approximately 96 dB) is acquired. In this case, since luminance values related to the same exposure level are 4 bits long out of 8 bits long, the ratio of the shutter speed values indicated by the adjoining shutter timing signals is 1:16. For example, as mentioned above, the shutter speed (exposure time) value indicated by the shutter timing signal ST1 is set to 1/30 sec. The shutter speed value indicated by the shutter timing signal ST2 is set to 1/500 sec. The shutter speed value indicated by the shutter timing signal ST3 is set to 1/8000 sec. Thus, assuming that luminance values acquired with the shutter speed set sequentially to the values indicated by the shutter timing signals ST1, ST2, and ST3 are Y1, Y2, and Y3, synthetic luminance information Y is calculated as Y=Y1+16\u00d7Y2+16\u00d7\u00d716\u00d7Y3.",
        "Referring to FIG. 3, luminance information acquirable with a wide dynamic range is produced at step S4 as mentioned above. Thereafter, the signal distribution arithmetic circuit 33 produces a histogram, which represents the distribution of frequencies of brightness levels, using the luminance information (step S5). For example, when a photographic scene is the one shown in FIG. 4A, the produced histogram is outlined with a curve shown in FIG. 6.",
        "Thereafter, the signal distribution analyzing circuit 34 detects a peak frequency of the histogram produced at step S5, and retrieves a luminance level related to the peak frequency (step S6). At step S6, a peak detection interval between instants at which a peak frequency of a histogram is detected is pre-set. When a slope determined by frequency values detected at the start and end of each peak detection interval changes from a positive value to a negative value, the frequency detected at the end of an immediately preceding peak detection interval is regarded as a peak frequency. A luminance level related to the peak frequency is then retrieved. In the case of the histogram shown in FIG. 6, a frequency indicated with a hatched bar and concerned with a figure is detected as a peak frequency, and a luminance level related to the peak frequency is retrieved. Referring to FIG. 6, the slope hardly changes during adjoining peak detection intervals (including an interval during which the slope determined with frequency values hardly changes from a positive value and an interval during which the slope changes to a negative value). The frequencies detected during the intervals are judged to share the same peak frequency value and detected as a peak frequency. A luminance level related to the peak frequency is then retrieved. Consequently, in the case of the histogram shown in FIG. 6, the adjoining frequencies indicated with the hatched bars and concerned with a background are detected as one peak frequency, and the luminance level related to the peak frequency is then retrieved. Therefore, when the photographic scene is as shown in FIG. 4A, two peak frequencies are detected, and related luminance levels are then retrieved.",
        "A peak frequency of a histogram is used to obtain the imaging timing at which a related luminance level permits relatively appropriate exposure. As shown in FIG. 6, even when the frequencies indicated with the hatched bars and concerned with a background are detected as a peak frequency, luminance levels related to the frequencies do not vary very greatly but result from the same exposure. The peak frequency need therefore not be detected very strictly. Consequently, the signal distribution analyzing circuit 34 can be configured simply.",
        "The luminance levels related to the peak frequencies are retrieved from the histogram at step S6. Thereafter, the shutter timing calculating circuit 35 retrieves, as shown in FIG. 7, a shutter speed value, which is indicated by a shutter timing signal and associated with each luminance level, from the shutter timing calculation LUT 36 (step S7). The shutter timing signal indicating the retrieved shutter speed value is used as shutter timing signals for actual photographing (step S8). With the shutter timing signal, for example, the release switch is pressed fully in order to start actual photographing (step S9).",
        "Consequently, when a photographic scene is like the one shown in FIG. 4A, actual photographing makes it possible to acquire image information for two image fields at the exposure levels determined with the shutter speed values of 1/60 sec and 1/500 sec shown in FIG. 7. The camera signal processing circuit 6 that is an image information converting means synthesizes the image values for two image fields acquired during the actual photographing according to a known means. Eventually, an image obtainable with a wide dynamic range that is matched to a brightness range exhibited by the photographic scene can be produced.",
        "As mentioned above, according to the present embodiment, in the photographic scene dependent photographing mode, a photographic scene is pre-photographed with the shutter speed set to the pre-set values indicated by the shutter timing signals ST1, ST2, and ST3 in order to acquire information concerning a dynamic range. A histogram graphically expressing synthetic information is produced. A shutter speed value to be indicated with a shutter timing signal is determined so that a luminance level related to a peak frequency of the histogram will permit relatively appropriate exposure. Actual photographing is then performed with the shutter speed set to the determined value. Even when a photographic scene exhibits a large brightness difference, the AE facility need not be driven all the time but imaging can be achieved optimally for the photographic scene. Eventually, an image obtainable with a wide dynamic range can be reproduced.",
        "According to the present embodiment, all pixels are read during pre-photographing during which photographing is performed with the shutter speed set sequentially to the values indicated with the shutter timing signals ST1, ST2, and ST3 respectively. A histogram is then produced. The present invention is not limited to this mode. For example, the camera signal processing circuit 6 may thin out the pixels to read one pixel per two to eight pixels lined in a horizontal or vertical direction under the control of the CPU 8. A histogram may then be produced using the read pixels. In this case, precision deteriorates a little but a processing time can be shortened.",

The acquired image values (luminance values) are transferred to the signal synthesizing circuit 42 via the A/D converter 5. The image values for three image fields are synthesized based on exposure levels attained during imaging, whereby luminance information acquirable with a wide dynamic range is produced. The luminance information is transferred to the signal distribution arithmetic circuit 43. A histogram representing the distribution of luminance levels in the photographic scene is then produced arithmetically.",

This results in the cumulative histogram that is, as shown in FIG. 10B, devoid of frequencies of luminance levels affected by noise. The cumulative histogram is transferred as a gray scale conversion characteristic curve to the camera signal processing circuit 6. The cumulative histogram is used to convert image information acquired during actual photographing, and then transferred to the shutter timing calculating circuit 45.",

In other words, a domain indicating an area in an image field in which image data is present at a high density is detected in the characteristic curve. Frequencies contained in the domain detected in the characteristic curve that outlines a cumulative histogram are weighted, and luminance levels related to the weighted frequencies are averaged or a mean of the luminance levels is obtained. A shutter speed value associated with the obtained luminance level is retrieved from the shutter timing calculation LUT 46 and indicated by a shutter timing signal.",

A gray scale conversion characteristic curve is produced by removing frequencies of luminance levels affected by noise from a histogram produced using the synthetic information. A shutter speed value to be indicated by a shutter timing signal and adopted for actual photographing is determined using the gray scale conversion characteristic curve. Actual photographing is then performed with the shutter speed set to the determined value. Eventually, even if a photographic scene exhibits a large brightness difference, a good-quality image obtainable with a wide dynamic range that is matched to a brightness range exhibited by the photographic scene can be produced. Moreover, the gray scale conversion characteristic curve produced by the gray scale conversion characteristic calculating circuit 44 is transferred to the camera signal processing circuit 6 so that it will be used to convert image information acquired during actual photographing. It is therefore unnecessary to produce a gray scale conversion characteristic curve in the course of processing image information values acquired during actual photographing.

The number of shutter timing signals is not limited to three but may be any value equal to or larger than 2. Moreover, the aforesaid embodiments have been described by taking for instance a photographic scene that is actually photographed in response to two shutter timing signals to be produced. Depending on a photographic scene, one or more than three shutter timing signals may be produced for actual photographing. Therefore, when only one shutter timing signal is produced, the camera signal processing circuit 6 need not perform image synthesis.

The A/D converter 5 converts analog information, which is amplified by the amplifier 4, into digital information. The camera signal processing circuit 6 performs various kinds of processing on the signal digitized by the A/D converter 5. The AF/AE/AWB wave detecting circuit 7 receives the digital signal from the A/D converter 5, and detects automatic focusing (AF)-related information, automatic exposure (AE)-related information, and automatic white balance control (AWB)-related information.

The shutter control information circuit 50 receives a digital signal from the A/D converter 5, and designates a condition for exposure as one of the conditions for actual photographing that is performed in a wide dynamic range photographing mode that will be described later. Moreover, the shutter control information circuit 50 outputs information concerning an exposure level, such as, an exposure time. The selection switch 22 controls input of information concerning an exposure level according to what imaging mode is designated.

        "First, assuming that the result of judgment made to see if a condition for exposure is appropriate is \u201cdetermination of a condition for exposure\u201d, the conditions-for-exposure judging circuit 53 transmits actual photographing exposure information ff as a condition for exposure that is one of the conditions for actual photographing. A shutter control information-for-actual photographing producing circuit 55 serving as a conditions-for-photographing setting means receives the actual photographing exposure information ff, produces shutter control information with which actual photographing is performed, and transmits the shutter control information as actual photographing shutter control information hh.",
        "On the other hand, when the result of judgment made to see if a condition for exposure is appropriate is \u201cchange of a condition for exposure\u201d, the conditions-for-exposure judging circuit 53 transmits changed exposure information ee as a condition for exposure to be changed. A conditions-for-exposure changing circuit 54 serving as a conditions-for-photographing setting means and a control means receives the changed exposure information ee, changes the current condition for exposure, and produces shutter control information that matches the changed condition for exposure and that is used to perform pre-photographing again. The conditions-for-exposure changing circuit 54 then transmits the shutter control information as pre-photographing shutter control information gg.",
        "A shutter control information selection switch 56 switches input signals according to control information ii sent from the CPU 8 that has received the exposure optimization information dd from the conditions-for-exposure judging circuit 53. Since the shutter control information selection switch 56 thus switches input signals, the pre-photographing shutter control information gg or actual photographing shutter control information hh is transmitted as shutter control information kk to the selection switch 22.",
        "Moreover, the CPU 8 judges from the result of judgment, which is represented by the exposure optimization information dd, whether pre-photographing should be performed again or a standby state should be retained until actual photographing is started.",
        "Specifically, if the exposure optimization information dd represents \u201cchange of a condition for exposure\u201d, the CPU 8 instructs that pre-photographing should be performed again according to the shutter control information kk produced by the conditions-for-exposure changing circuit 54 in order to acquire luminance information concerning a photographic scene. The CPU 8 then instructs the shutter control information circuit 50 to perform the foregoing processing according to the luminance information aa produced by the A/D converter 5.",

        "FIG. 14 is a flowchart describing processing to be performed by the shutter control information circuit 50.",

        "When the processing is started, the scene information distribution calculating circuit 51 produces a histogram of luminance information aa concerning a photographic scene (step S11). The histogram to be produced is equivalent to luminance distribution information bb shown in FIG. 13.",
        "Thereafter, the scene information analyzing circuit 52 references the produced histogram to obtain the frequency of a luminance level indicating a dark point and the frequency of a luminance level indicating a bright point (step S12). The obtained frequencies and related luminance levels are equivalent to luminance analysis information cc shown in FIG. 13.",
        "Thereafter, the frequency of the luminance level indicating a bright (dark) point is compared with a predetermined value (for example, 10% of the sum total of frequency values contained in the histogram) (step S13).",
        "If it is judged at step S13 that the frequency of the luminance level indicating a bright (dark) point is equal to or larger than the predetermined value, it is thought that a highlight (shadow) results from photographing to be performed under a current condition for exposure. The current condition for photographing is therefore changed to the one determining an exposure value (EV) that makes an image one-step darker (brighter) (step S14). The condition for exposure treated at step S14 is equivalent to changed exposure information ee shown in FIG. 13.",
        "Thereafter, the conditions-for-exposure changing circuit 54 produces pre-photographing shutter control information gg, which is needed to perform pre-photographing again, according to the changed condition for exposure (step S15).",
        "The produced pre-photographing shutter control information gg is transmitted as shutter control information kk through the shutter control information selection switch 56. The CPU 8 is thus instructed to perform pre-photographing again according to the shutter control information kk (step S16). The instruction given to the CPU 8 at step S16 is equivalent to exposure optimization information dd shown in FIG. 13.",
        "On the other hand, if it is judged at step S13 that the frequency of the luminance level indicating a bright (dark) point is smaller than the predetermined value, it is thought that imaging to be performed under a current condition for exposure is optimal for the relatively bright (dark) object. Under the current condition for exposure (that is, actual photographing exposure information ff shown in FIG. 13), the shutter control information-for-actual photographing producing circuit 55 produces actual photographing shutter control information hh that is needed to perform actual photographing (step S17).",
        "The produced actual photographing shutter control information hh is transmitted as shutter control information kk through the shutter control information selection switch 56. The CPU 8 is thus informed of the fact that actual photographing can be performed based on the shutter control information kk (the standby state is retained). The information given to the CPU 8 is, like the instruction given at step S16, equivalent to the exposure optimization information dd shown in FIG. 13.",
        "When step S16 or S18 is completed, the processing is terminated.",
        "Herein, when exposure is performed twice with a condition for exposure varied as it is in the present embodiment, imaging including the processing described in FIG. 14 is performed as mentioned below.",
        "As mentioned above, an initial condition for exposure is determined based on normal automatic exposure (AE)-related information, and pre-photographing is performed.",
        "Thereafter, as described in FIG. 14, both processing concerning a bright point and processing concerning a dark point are carried out.",
        "When both the processing concerning a bright point and the processing concerning a dark point enter the step at which a standby state is retained until actual photographing is started, photographing is performed once. This is because it is unnecessary to perform imaging twice under the same condition for exposure (the photographing is the same as the photographing in the normal photographing mode).",
        "If a condition for exposure is changed in both the bright and dark points as they are at step S14, the condition for exposure is changed such that an exposure value (EV) makes an image one-step darker (condition for exposure determining a one-step smaller EV). Moreover, the condition for exposure is changed such that an EV makes an image one-step brighter (condition for exposure determining a one-step larger EV). Then, pre-photographing is performed again with the respective condition for exposure varied as mentioned above.",
        "Thereafter, the processing described in FIG. 14 is performed. If the condition for exposure is the condition for exposure determining a one-step smaller EV, information concerning the bright point alone is processed. If the condition for exposure is changed as described as step S14, the condition for exposure is changed such that an EV makes an image one-more-step darker (that is, a two-steps smaller EV). Pre-photographing is then performed again. Thereafter, the processing described in FIG. 14 is performed on the information concerning the bright point alone.",

        "Furthermore, in the case of the condition for exposure is changed as described as step S14 relative to photographing of either the bright or dark point, changing of the condition is made as follows. When the condition for exposure may be changed relative to photographing of the bright point, the condition for exposure is changed such that an EV makes an image one-step darker (one-step smaller EV). When the condition for exposure is changed relative to photographing of the dark point, the condition for exposure is changed such that an EV makes an image one-step brighter (one-step larger EV). Thereafter, the processing of information concerning either the bright or dark point is performed.",
        "FIG. 15A to FIG. 15J show images concerning processing performed in the shutter control information circuit 50.",
        "First, pre-photographing is performed under an initial condition for exposure (for example, with an exposure time set to 1/250 sec). Consequently, luminance information concerning a photographic scene shown in FIG. 15A is acquired. A luminance histogram produced this time represents a distribution like the one shown in FIG. 15B. In this case, the frequency of a luminance level indicating a dark point DK (left side of a left-hand dashed line) and the frequency of a luminance level indicating a bright point BR (right side of a right-hand dashed line) are so large as to exceed a frequency threshold Th. The frequency threshold Th is indicated with a dotted-chain line and used as a criterion for a condition for exposure. The condition for exposure must therefore be changed both the bright point BR and the dark point DK.",
        "Thereafter, the condition for exposure is changed relative to the bright point BR and the dark point DK respectively. Pre-photographing is performed again in order to acquire luminance information.",
        "First, an initial condition for exposure under which the dark point DK is imaged is changed such that an EV that makes an image one-step brighter (a one-step larger EV, that is, with an exposure time set to 1/125 sec). At this time, luminance information like the one shown in FIG. 15C is acquired. A luminance histogram like the one shown in FIG. 15D is then produced. In this case, the condition for exposure under which the dark point DK is imaged is checked based on the criterion for a condition for exposure. Since the frequency of the luminance level indicating the dark point DK still exceeds the frequency threshold Th, the condition for exposure is requested to be further changed. The condition for exposure is then changed such that an EV makes an image two-steps brighter (a two-steps larger EV, that is, with the exposure time set to 1/60 sec). Pre-photographing is performed again in order to acquire luminance information. The luminance information acquired under the condition for exposure determining a two-steps larger EV is, for example, like the one shown in FIG. 15G. A luminance histogram like the one shown in FIG. 15H is produced accordingly. As illustrated, the frequency of the luminance level indicating the dark point DK is smaller than the frequency threshold Th. The condition for exposure (the exposure time set to 1/60 sec) is adopted as one of the conditions for actual photographing. Consequently, the conditions for actual photographing are determined so that a figure contained in the photographic scene shown in FIG. 15A can be imaged while being exposed properly.",
        "On the other hand, the condition for exposure under which the bright point BR is imaged is changed such that an EV makes an image one-step darker (one-step smaller EV, that is, with the exposure time set to 1/500 sec). At this time, luminance information like the one shown in FIG. 15E is acquired, and a luminance histogram like the one shown in FIG. 15F is produced accordingly. The condition for exposure is checked based on the criterion for a condition for exposure to see if the bright point BR is photographed properly under the condition. In this case, the frequency of the luminance value indicating the bright point BR, which is contained in the histogram, exceeds the frequency threshold Th. Similarly to the case of the dark point DK, the condition for exposure is requested to be further changed. The condition for exposure is therefore changed such that an EV makes an image two-steps darker (two-steps smaller EV, that is, with the exposure time set to 1/1000 sec). Pre-photographing is then performed again in order to acquire luminance information. The luminance information acquired under the condition for exposure determining the two-steps smaller EV is, for example, like the one shown in FIG. 15I, and a luminance histogram like the one shown in FIG. 15J is produced accordingly. As illustrated, the frequency of the luminance level indicating the bright point BR, which is contained in the histogram, is smaller than the frequency threshold Th. The condition for exposure determined this time (the exposure time set to 1/1000 sec) is therefore adopted as the other one of the conditions for actual photographing. Consequently, the conditions for actual photographing are determined so that the background of the photographic scene like the one shown in FIG. 15A can be imaged while being exposed properly.",
        "When the photographic scene like the one shown in FIG. 15A is photographed in the wide dynamic range photographing mode, exposure is performed twice continuously under the conditions for imaging including the condition of the exposure time set to 1/60 sec and the condition of the exposure time set to 1/1000 sec. Both proper image information concerning the figure and proper image information concerning the background are acquired and then synthesized. This results in an image obtainable with a wide dynamic range. In the image, both the figure and background appear in a properly exposed state.",
        "According to the third embodiment, prior to actual photographing, information concerning a dynamic range needed to photograph a photographic scene is acquired and analyzed. The conditions for actual photographing are determined based on the results of the analysis. Imaging is then achieved by performing one exposure or by performing a plurality of exposures with a condition for exposure varied. The condition for exposure optimal for a dynamic range needed to image the photographic scene can be determined automatically in order to perform imaging. Eventually, an image obtainable with a dynamic range needed to photograph the photographic scene can be produced in order to reproduce the photographic scene. In particular, when exposure is performed a plurality of times with the condition for exposure varied, even if photographing a photographic scene requires a wide dynamic range, the photographic scene can be imaged optimally. Eventually, an image obtainable with the wide dynamic range can be substantially produced in order to reproduce the photographic scene.",

        "In the digital still camera of the fourth embodiment, similarly to the aforesaid digital still cameras, the shutter is controlled on the assumption that when the wide dynamic range photographing mode is selected, exposure is performed twice with a condition for exposure varied.",
        "In the configuration shown in FIG. 16, pre-photographing is performed in order to acquire luminance information concerning a photographic scene. The processing from the step at which the A/D converter 5 produces luminance information aa concerning the photographic scene to the step at which a scene information distribution calculating circuit 61 produces luminance distribution information bb is identical to the processing described in FIG. 13 implemented in the third embodiment. The scene information distribution calculating circuit 61 has the same configuration as the scene information distribution calculating circuit 51 and serves as an information acquiring means.",
        "Thereafter, a scene information analyzing circuit 62 that is an analyzing means receives the luminance distribution information (histogram) bb from the scene information distribution calculating circuit 61, and receives strobe setting information mm from the CPU 8. The scene information analyzing circuit 62 then analyzes the histogram. Specifically, according to the fourth embodiment, the strobe setting information mm is acquired in order to estimate within what range the brightness of a major object falls. The subsequent processing is performed so that the major object will be exposed properly. If the major object exists at a bright point, a condition for exposure is determined relative to imaging of the bright point alone. If the major object exists at a dark point, the condition for exposure is determined relative to imaging of the dark point alone. At this time, the condition for exposure is determined to realize proper exposure.",
        "For example, if the strobe setting information mm signifies that the strobe is used, a photographic scene in which a figure poses while being backlit in the daytime or a figure poses at night is estimated. At this time, the luminance distribution information (histogram) bb produced under an initial condition for exposure is referenced.",
        "Assume that the luminance distribution information (histogram) bb reveals that the frequency of a luminance level indicating a bright point (highlight) in the histogram is larger than a predetermined value. This means that the photographic scene contains many points equivalent to the highlight. The photographic scene is therefore thought to correspond to the photographic scene in which a figure poses while being backlit in the daytime. Since the strobe is used, a major object is estimated to lie at a relatively dark point. Consequently, the subsequent processing is performed in order to optimize a condition for exposure under which the dark point at which the major object lies is imaged.",
        "Moreover, if the frequency of a luminance level indicating a bright point (highlight) in the histogram is equal to or smaller than a predetermined value, it is thought that the photographic scene does not contain many points equivalent to the highlight. The photographic scene is therefore regarded to correspond to the photographic scene in which a figure poses at night. The strobe is therefore used to image the photographic scene, and the major object is estimated to lie at a relatively bright point. Consequently, the subsequent processing is performed in order to optimize the condition for exposure relative to the bright point under which the main object lies.",

A difference between a maximum value of the photometry level and a minimum value thereof which are detected in each area is calculated, and the ratio of the difference to the largest value of the photometry level detected in the image field is calculated. An exposure ratio value is retrieved from the lookup table shown in FIG. 18 in association with the calculated ratio.",
        "In the example shown in FIG. 18, the ratio of the difference to the largest value is classified into five ranges. Depending on whether the actual photographing exposure information oo is concerned with a bright point or a dark point, a unique exposure ratio value is retrieved from the table. Specifically, assuming that the ratio of the difference to the largest value falls within a range of 50% or more, the exposure ratio assumes a value of, for example, 16. That is to say, if the actual photographing exposure information oo is concerned with the bright point, the exposure ratio assumes a value of 16. If the actual photographing exposure information oo is concerned with the dark point, the exposure ratio assumes a value of 1/16. The same applies to any other value assumed by the ratio of the difference to the largest value. Namely, if the ratio of the difference to the largest value falls within a range from 25 to 50%, the exposure ratio assumes a value of 8. If the ratio of the difference to the largest value falls within a range from 10 to 25%, the exposure ratio assumes a value of 4.

If the ratio of the difference to the largest value falls within a range less than 5%, the exposure ratio assumes a value of 1.

Thus, an exposure ratio value may be calculated. Nevertheless, the present invention is not limited to these means but can be applied to any other various means.",
        "According to the fourth embodiment, prior to actual photographing, information concerning a dynamic range required to photograph a photographic scene is acquired and analyzed. The conditions for actual photographing are determined based on the result of the analysis. Photographing is then achieved by performing one exposure or by performing a plurality of exposures with a condition for exposure varied. The fourth embodiment can therefore provide the same advantages as the third embodiment. In particular, when photographing is achieved by performing a plurality of exposures with the condition for exposure varied, the exposure ratio is adjusted. Therefore, even when a photographic scene requires a wide dynamic range, the photographic scene can be photographed optimally. Namely, an image obtainable with a wide dynamic range can be produced in order to reproduce the photographic scene.",
