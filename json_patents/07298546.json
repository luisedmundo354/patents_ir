        "This is a continuation of PCT/JP/2003/015772 filed Dec. 10, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "The present invention relates to an ultraviolet light source that amplifies signal light in an infrared-to-visible range by a fiber optical amplifier and converts the amplified light into ultraviolet light as an output by a wavelength-converting optical system. The present invention relates also to laser treatment apparatus and to exposure apparatus, each apparatus comprising an ultraviolet light source, respectively.",
        "Nowadays, ultraviolet laser lights, which have short wavelengths and high temporal coherence, are used in various fields. For example, ultraviolet laser light are used in exposure apparatus in semiconductor-device and in surgical and laser treatment apparatus for such operations as performed in surgery, ophthalmology and dentistry. Ultraviolet laser light are used also in various measuring instruments and analyzers and in processing apparatus. Ultraviolet light sources used in such apparatus include KrF excimer laser, which has an oscillation wavelength at \u03bb=248 nm, and ArF excimer laser, which has an oscillation wavelength at \u03bb=193 nm. Although these excimer lasers are already comprised as light sources in various apparatus, they have problems of troublesome maintenance and high running costs because these lasers use fluorine gas as an operational medium besides their being expensive and large in size.",
        "Therefore, a study has been eagerly conducted for an all solid state ultraviolet light source that comprises as a signal light source a solid state laser oscillating in an infrared-to-visible range, that amplifies the light output from the solid state laser by a fiber optical amplifier, and that converts the amplified light into ultraviolet light having a predetermined wavelength as an output by a wavelength-converting optical system. As such an all solid state ultraviolet light source, a proposed ultraviolet light source comprises as a signal light source a DFB semiconductor laser oscillating stably in a band at wavelength \u03bb=1.55 \u03bcm, amplifies the light output from the semiconductor laser to a desired light intensity by an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (hereinafter abbreviated to \u201cEDFA\u201d), and converts the amplified light to ultraviolet light having a wavelength \u03bb=193 nm, which is the eighth harmonic, as an output by a wavelength-converting optical system, which comprises a crystal for wavelength conversion (refer to, for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2000-200747 and No. 2001-353176).",
        "As EDFAs used in such an all solid state ultraviolet light source, known are a single-clad EDFA, which excites an erbium-doped single-clad and single mode fiber (EDF) by a semiconductor laser of single mode oscillation, and a double-clad EDFA, which excites a double-clad EDF by a semiconductor laser of multi-mode oscillation (refer to, for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2000-200747 and No. 2001-353176).",
        "Yet, prior-art EDFAs such as those mentioned above have the following problems. First of all, for a single-clad EDFA, the optical power of the single mode oscillation semiconductor laser that excites the EDFA is limited within a range of hundreds of mW, which is comparatively low, so signal light at a low repetition frequency of a few kHz and at a low duty must be used to generate a peak power higher than 10 kW (with a pulse width of up to 1 ns). The light output from the EDFA in this case, even if a high peak power is gained, achieves only a relatively low power of about 100 mW at the most as an average power. This is a problem indicating that the original amplifying ability of the fiber optical amplifier is not utilized fully.",
        "Also, in a fiber-optical amplifier like that described above, it is a common practice to arrange a plurality of EDFAs in series connection in a multiple stage construction to achieve a predetermined peak power. However the ASE lights generated in the EDFA are added as DC noises to the signal-less parts between adjacent signal pulses, which leads to a significant reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio of the output signal. Therefore, as an arrangement for removing DC noise components in a multi-staged EDFA, an electro-optic modulating element or an acousto-optic modulating element is provided between adjacent stages, and each modulating element is controlled to synchronize with a signal light source to supply signal light at a high signal-to-noise ratio to a rear stage EDFA. However, the construction of the EDFA becomes complicated, and the manufacturing cost of the EDFA also grows expensive. In addition, there is a problem of loss in the signal light caused by inserting the modulation elements.",
        "On the other hand, a double-clad EDFA comprises a first clad and a second clad. The first clad surrounds a core doped with a laser medium and functions as a coupler for excitation light, and the second clad is formed around the first clad to provide a waveguide to the first clad. As the first clad has a multi-mode and a relatively large cross-sectional area, it can efficiently couple high-power semiconductor lasers that have multi-mode oscillations, improving the power transmission of the excitation light, and thereby increases the pulse repetition frequency and the average output power. However, in a double-clad EDFA, the excitation efficiency per unit length is lower than a single-clad EDFA, which feeds excitation light directly into the core. Because of this, it is difficult to reduce the length of the fiber in a double-clad EDFA, so there is a problem of an increased loss in the signal light, which is caused by nonlinear effects such as a parametric process or a simulated Raman scattering, occurring in the fiber. As a result, a double-clad EDFA cannot achieve as high a peak power as a single-clad EDFA.",
        "The present invention has been conceived in view of the above mentioned problems and has an objective to provide an ultraviolet light source that has a simple construction and generates both a high peak power and a high average power. It is also an object of the present invention to provide exposure apparatus and laser treatment apparatus, each system comprising such an ultraviolet light source.",
        "To solve the above problems and to achieve the objectives, the present invention provides an ultraviolet light source that comprises a laser light source, which generates signal light in an infrared-to-visible range, a optical amplifier, which includes at least one stage of fiber optical amplifier and amplifies the signal light generated by the laser light source, and a wavelength-converting optical system, which converts the signal light amplified by the optical amplifier into ultraviolet light as an output. In the ultraviolet light source, a single mode fiber laser is used as an excitation light source for at least one stage of fiber optical amplifier in the optical amplifier.",
        "In this ultraviolet light source according to the present invention, it is preferable that the fiber optical amplifier that uses a single mode fiber laser as an excitation light source be a final stage fiber optical amplifier in the optical amplifier.",
        "In the ultraviolet light source, it is also preferable that the single mode fiber laser be a Raman fiber laser.",
        "In this ultraviolet light source, the single mode fiber laser can be a ytterbium-doped (Yb) fiber laser.",
        "Furthermore, the ultraviolet light source may comprise a wavelength division multiplexer, which is provided on the input side of the optical amplifier. In this case, the wavelength division multiplexer is a fiber-fused type and mixes the signal light coaxially with the excitation light output from the excitation light source.",
        "Laser treatment apparatus according to the present invention comprises an ultraviolet light source described above and an irradiation optical system, which leads ultraviolet light emitted from the ultraviolet light source to a treatment site for irradiation.",
        "Exposure apparatus according to the present invention comprises an ultraviolet light source described above, a mask-supporting part, which supports a photomask provided with a predetermined exposure pattern, an object-supporting part, which supports an object to be exposed, an illumination optical system, which leads ultraviolet light emitted from the ultraviolet light source to illuminate the photomask supported by the mask-supporting part, and a projection optical system, which leads the light that has passed through the photomask in the illumination through the illumination optical system, to project the object to be exposed, which is supported by the object-supporting part.",

        "Ultraviolet Light Source",
        "At first, an embodiment of an ultraviolet light source according to the present invention is described in reference to FIG. 1\u02dcFIG. 4, each of which shows a section of the ultraviolet light source. The ultraviolet light source 1 comprises a laser light source 10, which generates signal light in an infrared-to-visible range, an optical amplifier 20, which includes a front stage fiber optical amplifier 21 and a rear stage fiber optical amplifier 22 and amplifies the signal light generated by the laser light source 10, and a wavelength-converting optical system 30, which converts the signal light amplified by the optical amplifier into ultraviolet light as an output in wavelength conversion. The ultraviolet light source 1 further comprises a single mode fiber laser as an excitation light source 26 for the rear stage fiber optical amplifier 22 of the optical amplifier 20.",
        "The laser light source 10 comprises a solid state laser 11 and a controller 12, which controls the operation of the solid state laser, and the laser light source 10 is a signal light source that outputs signal light in pulses to the light amplifier 20. The solid state laser 11 can be, for example, an InGaAsP, Distributed Feedback (DFB) semiconductor laser, which oscillates at wavelength \u03bb=1.55 \u03bcm in an infrared band. The oscillating wavelength of the above mentioned DFB semiconductor laser has temperature dependency of about 0.1 nm/degree C., so while the semiconductor laser is controlled at constant temperature, it outputs narrow-band infrared light at a single wavelength, for example, \u03bb=1547 nm. The controller 12, which is a driver that controls the DFB semiconductor laser 11, supplies a driving signal with a pulse width of about 1 ns at repetition-frequency f=tens or hundreds kHz to the DFB semiconductor laser 11, so that the DFB semiconductor laser 11 operates in pulse oscillation and outputs a pulse-like signal light at a peak power of about 10 mW to the optical amplifier 20.",
        "An external modulator, for example, an electro-optic modulating element or an acousto-optic modulating element may be used to form optical pulses from an output of the DFB semiconductor laser 11 stably oscillating in CW mode. By such an arrangement, narrow-band signal light with little frequency chirp can be output to the optical amplifier 20.",
        "The optical amplifier 20, which is an amplifier that amplifies the signal light having a wavelength \u03bb=1547 nm output from the laser light source 10, comprises the above mentioned front stage and rear stage fiber optical amplifiers 21 and 22, a polarization controller 24, a compound module 25, and the above mentioned excitation light source 26, which excites the rear stage fiber optical amplifier 22. In the optical amplifier 20, the front stage and rear stage fiber optical amplifiers 21 and 22 are connected with each other in series.",
        "The polarization controller 24, which is provided at the input part of the optical amplifier 20, is a fiber type polarization controller, and controls the polarization of the signal light to suppress nonlinear processes like four-wave mixing or stimulated Raman scattering, which can occur at the rear stage fiber optical amplifier 22.",
        "The front stage fiber optical amplifier 21 is a preamplifier that amplifies the signal light of a peak power of about 10 mW output from the laser light source 10 up to about 1 kW. As the peak power of the light output is about 1 kW at this preamplifier part, a single clad erbium-doped fiber (EDF) is used as the fiber optical amplifier 21, and the output of a single mode semiconductor laser as excitation light is coupled to the EDF. This excitation light source for the EDF, which constitutes the front stage fiber optical amplifier 21, and a Wavelength Division Multiplexer (WDM), which leads the excitation light to the fiber core are not shown in FIG. 1.",
        "For a stable optical amplification of the peak power from 10 mW to 1 kW (gain 50 dB), it is preferable that the front stage fiber optical amplifier 21 comprise two stages of EDFAs. In this case, between the first stage EDFA and the second stage EDFA, a narrow-band filter is provided to remove ASE, which is generated at the first stage, and an isolator is inserted to suppress the oscillations at the first stage and at the second stage.",
        "On the other hand, it cannot be ignored that the signal gain decreases in the range where the peak power exceeds 1 kW because of nonlinear effects such as four-wave mixing or stimulated Raman scattering. Therefore, it is desirable that the fiber of the fiber optical amplifier 21, if the fiber optical amplifier 21 comprises a single stage, or the fiber of the second stage, if the fiber optical amplifier 21 comprises two stages, be a single clad EDF with high erbium concentration (Er concentration>1000 ppm) and a large mode radius of about 10 \u03bcm.",
        "The signal light emitted from the front stage fiber optical amplifier 21 enters the compound module 25, in which a collimator lens 251, a narrow-band filter 252, an isolator 253, a Wavelength Division Multiplexer (WDM) 254, a collimator lens 255, and a condenser lens 256 are assembled together into one unit as shown in FIG. 3.",
        "Here, the narrow-band filter 252 is a filter that passes signal light only within a predetermined transmission bandwidth whose center is at the output wavelength of the DFB semiconductor laser 11. As the narrow-band filter 252, a narrow-band filter with a transmission bandwidth of, for example, about 1 nm is used to remove noise components like ASE that is generated at the front stage fiber optical amplifier 21 and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal light fed into the rear stage fiber optical amplifier 22. In addition, an isolator 253 is provided to isolate the front stage fiber optical amplifier 21 from the rear stage fiber optical amplifier 22 for preventing oscillation caused by the backward propagation of the light coming from the rear stage fiber optical amplifier 22 and gain reduction caused by multiple reflections of the ASE.",
        "The Wavelength Division Multiplexer (hereinafter referred to as \u201cWDM\u201d) 254 is a device that mixes the signal light, which is emitted from the front stage fiber optical amplifier 21 and is collimated by the collimator lens 251, with the excitation light (pumping light), which is led from the excitation light source 26 through a fiber 268 and is collimated by the collimator lens 255. FIG. 3 shows a reflective type WDM, which superposes coaxially the signal light and the excitation light by transmitting the signal light having a wavelength \u03bb=1547 nm, which is emitted from the fiber optical amplifier 21, and by reflecting the excitation light having a wavelength \u03bb=1480 nm, which is led from the excitation light source (Raman fiber laser) 26.",
        "The fiber-type compound module 25, which comprises the above described optical elements as a unit, has a high efficiency because of its design minimizing coupling loss and fusion splice loss. It also avoids nonlinear effect as fibers involved can be shortened.",
        "The excitation light source 26 is a single mode fiber laser, and FIG. 1 shows a Raman fiber laser as an example. The Raman fiber laser 26 is an excitation light source for the rear stage fiber optical amplifier 22 and supplies excitation light having a wavelength \u03bb=1480 nm at a single mode CW power of 10 W through a fiber 268 to the WDM 254. Here, the Raman fiber laser is explained briefly. It is a laser that comprises a ytterbium-doped fiber laser and a cascade Raman resonator including FBGs. The output terminal of the ytterbium-doped fiber laser is connected to the cascade Raman resonator. It can output a laser light at a CW power of up to about 20 W and at wavelength \u03bb=1480 nm in single mode.",
        "If the excitation light source 26 is operated in a range where the excitation light output therefrom exceeds 5 W in CW power, then instead of the reflective type WDM used in the compound module 25 described above, preferably, a fiber-fused type WDM 29 be provided separately in addition to a compound module 28, which comprises an isolator and a band-pass filter as shown in FIG. 4. By this arrangement, the optical amplifier can be durable even in a case where a high power excitation light source is used to generate an average power above 5 W.",
        "In the case where the reflective type WDM 254 is used, the coupling can be done not only by a forward excitation (in which the direction of the excitation light is the same as that of the signal light) but also by a backward excitation (in which the direction of the excitation light is opposite to that of the signal light) as shown in FIG. 1. However, in the case where the fiber-fused type WDM 29 is used as shown in FIG. 4, it is preferable that a forward excitation (in which the direction of the excitation light is the same as that of the signal light) be executed.",
        "If the fiber-fused type WDM 29 is used in a backward excitation, then signal light at a high peak power, which has been amplified, passes through the WDM 29, inducing a nonlinear process. Therefore, it is not possible to achieve a high peak power.",
        "On the other hand, if a forward excitation is executed, then no nonlinear process is induced because signal light at a low peak power before its amplification passes through the WDM. In this case, it is possible to achieve a high peak power.",
        "At the outlet of the EDF, where signal light at a high power passes, even though the power of the excitation light decreases while it passes through the EDF, the Raman fiber laser maintains a sufficiently high power for the signal light relatively and does not interfere with the amplification of the signal light occurring near the outlet.",
        "The signal light emitted from the front stage fiber optical amplifier 21 and the excitation light emitted from the Raman fiber laser 26, which are combined coaxially at the WDM 254 in the above described way, are collected by the condenser lens 256 and then fed into the rear stage fiber optical amplifier 22.",
        "The rear stage fiber optical amplifier 22 is the last stage amplifier, which amplifies the signal light at a peak power of 1 kW after the amplification by the front stage fiber optical amplifier 21 up to a peak power of about 20 kW. This fiber optical amplifier 22 comprises a single clad EDF and operates with single mode high power excitation light, which is fed from the Raman fiber laser 26.",
        "At the rear stage fiber optical amplifier 22, the peak power of the input signal light is a already about 1 KW, which is amplified to become extremely high about 20 KW at the output of the amplifier. Therefore, the EDF comprises a single clad EDF doped with erbium at a high concentration (Er>1000 ppm) and has a large mode diameter greater than about 10 \u03bcm to avoid nonlinear process in the fiber.",
        "FIG. 5 is a graph describing a relation between the power of the excitation light output from the Raman fiber laser and the power of the signal light (fundamental wave output at 1547 nm) output from the light amplifier. The signal light output from the optical amplifier is controlled by changing the power of the excitation light output from the Raman fiber laser. The repetition-frequencies of the signal light at 100 kHz and at 200 kHz are indicated by (---\u25aa--- ) and by (), respectively, and an LD excitation is indicated by ().",
        "In this arrangement, for example, when the power of the excitation light output from the Raman fiber laser 26 is at 10 W, the signal light having a repetition-frequency f=200 kHz with a pulse width of 1 ns and a peak power of 10 mW, which is input from the front stage fiber optical amplifier 21, is amplified to infrared light at a high power with a peak power of 15 kW and an average power of more than 3 W as an output.",
        "By using a high power single mode fiber laser as an excitation light source for the last stage fiber optical amplifier in this way, the optical amplifier can achieve both a high peak power of more than 20 kW and a high average power of more than 2 W. In addition, a single clad and single mode EDF, which has a high excitation efficiency per unit length as EDF, can be used. Therefore, by shortening the fiber length of the EDFA, the device can be made smaller and lighter and the optical amplifier is realized with both a high peak power and a high average power.",
        "Moreover, the pulse-repetition frequency of the signal light can be increased up to hundreds kHz, increasing the pulse signal ON time per unit time and decreasing the pulse signal OFF time per unit time. As a result, the DC noise component in the signal light decreases correspondingly, and the signal-to-noise ratio improves remarkably. Therefore, this system does not need active modulating elements like electro-optic modulating elements or acousto-optic modulating elements, which are provided in a prior-art multi-staged EDFA between adjacent stages to cut the DC noise component, and therefore it does not need a controller that synchronizes the operation of these modulating elements to pulses of the signal light. As a result, the optical amplifier can be simplified substantially, reducing manufacturing cost and realizing a high stabilization.",
        "The above described embodiment discloses an example that uses an EDF whose core is doped only with erbium. However, a Yb-codoped EDF, which is an EDF added with ytterbium (Yb) in addition to erbium, can be also used. In this case, the fiber optical amplifier 22 comprises a ytterbium-doped fiber laser as a single mode fiber laser for the excitation light source 26. The ytterbium-doped fiber laser achieves a CW power of more than 10 W in single mode, so it can constitute a fiber optical amplifier that can output an average power of more than 2 W like the EDFA which comprises a Raman fiber laser as an excitation light source in the above described case.",
        "FIG. 1 and FIG. 4 disclose examples that comprise an LD 23 as an excitation light source for the EDF that constitutes the front stage fiber optical amplifier 21. However, a Raman fiber laser can be used also as an excitation light source for the EDF that constitutes the front stage fiber optical amplifier 21. In this case, a Raman fiber laser, which is different from the Raman fiber laser 26, is provided additionally, or the fiber 268 provided to the Raman fiber laser 26 is branched, and this branch fiber is provided to a compound module (not shown).",
        "The signal light having a wavelength \u03bb=1547 nm amplified by the optical amplifier 20 is collimated once by a collimator lens 27 and then output to the wavelength-converting optical system 30, which is an optical system that converts the signal light in an infrared range coming from the optical amplifier 20 into ultraviolet light. As an example of wavelength-converting optical system that functions in this way, FIG. 2 illustrates an arrangement that converts the signal light (fundamental wave laser light Lr) having a wavelength \u03bb=1547 nm input from the optical amplifier 20 into an ultraviolet laser light Lv having a wavelength \u03bb=193.4 nm, which is the eighth harmonic of the fundamental wave, as an output. This diagram is referred to in the following description.",

In this process, the fundamental wave (\u03bb=1547 nm) undergoes wavelength conversion and is converted into the second harmonic (\u03bb=773.5 nm), into the third harmonic (\u03bb=515.6 nm), into the sixth harmonic (\u03bb=257.8 nm), into the seventh harmonic (\u03bb=221 nm), and into the eighth harmonic (\u03bb=193.4 nm) in this listed order. Finally, the converted wave is output to the right side of the schematic diagram as ultraviolet laser light Lv having a wavelength \u03bb=194.3 nm, which corresponds to the eighth harmonic (eighth higher harmonic) of the fundamental wave.",

The phase matching is achieved by tuning the temperature of the LBO crystal (Non-Critical Phase Matching (NCPM)). At the LBO crystal 31, a Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) is performed to generate the second harmonic (frequency 2\u03c9, wavelength \u03bb=773.5 nm), having frequency which is twice of the fundamental wave of the light.",

It may be, for example, in a 248 nm band, which is substantially equal to that generated by a KrF excimer laser, or in a 157 nm band, which is substantially equal to that generated by an F2 laser.",
        "Laser Treatment Apparatus",
        "Now, laser treatment apparatus that comprises the ultraviolet light source 1 according to the present invention, which has been described above, is described in reference to FIG. 7 and FIG. 8. The laser treatment apparatus 5 is an apparatus for treating such disorders as myopia and astigmatism by correcting irregularities in the convexity and concavity or curvature of the cornea. In this case, the cornea is irradiated with an ultraviolet laser light for a cornea-ectal ablation in Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK) or for an inner ablation of the incised cornea in Laser Intrastromal Keratomileusis (LASIK).",

        "The apparatus housing 60 is mounted on an X-Y stage 62 on a base 61, so the apparatus housing 60 as a whole is movable with respect to the eyeball EY in the direction indicated by arrow X, i.e., the right and left direction in FIG. 7 and in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the page carrying the drawing, i.e., the Y direction.",
        "FIG. 8 shows the construction of the irradiation optical system 70 and that of the observation optical system 80. The irradiation optical system 70 comprises a condenser lens 71, which collects the ultraviolet laser light Lv having a wavelength \u03bb=193 nm emitted from the ultraviolet light source 1 to form a spot with a predetermined diameter on the eyeball EY, and a dichroic mirror 72, which reflects the ultraviolet laser light from the condenser lens 71 so as to irradiate the surface of the cornea HC of the eyeball EY as an object to be treated. The dichroic mirror 72 is set to reflect light in the ultraviolet range and to pass light in the visible range through. Therefore, the ultraviolet laser light Lv is reflected and aligned coaxial to the optical axis of the observation optical system 80, which is described below, for the irradiation of the cornea HC surface.",

The operator can see a magnified image of the cornea HC through the eyepiece 83.",
        "With this apparatus, the operator, for example, an ophthalmologist, can perform a laser treatment while he or she is watching through the observation optical system 80. For example, while the operator is observing the eyeball EY, he or she shifts the apparatus housing 60 in the X coordinate and in the Y coordinate and irradiates the surface of the cornea HC, which is an object to be treated, with a spotlighting ultraviolet laser light to cause a ablation in the irradiated area. The movement of the X-Y coordinate table 62 is controlled by an operation controller (not shown) so that the apparatus housing 60 is shifted in the X coordinate and the Y coordinate, moving the spotlight, which is projected on the surface of the cornea HC. Therefore, a cornea-ectal ablation is performed accurately as a treatment correcting such as myopia or astigmatism or hyperopia.",
        "By the way, the size of the ablation in laser treatment changes greatly in correspondence to the power of the ultraviolet laser light Lv irradiating the cornea HC. For this reason, the power of the ultraviolet laser light source 1 is easily adjustable, for example, by controlling the pulse-frequency of the laser light source 10, or by controlling the power of the excitation light of the optical amplifier 20. Furthermore, the ultraviolet laser light can be turned ON and OFF by controlling the ON-OFF of the DFB semiconductor laser of the laser light source 10.
