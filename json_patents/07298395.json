        "1. Technical Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates generally to an angular position sensor working to measure an angular position of a rotary member, and more particularly to an improved structure of such an angular position sensor designed to sense a magnetic flux density that is higher in linearity.",
        "2. Background Art",
        "Typical angular position sensors working to measure an angular position of a rotary shaft are made up of a ring-shaped magnet with an N-pole and an S-pole arrayed in a circumferential direction thereof, a magnetic yoke disposed around the periphery of the magnet, and magnetic sensors. The magnetic yoke has formed therein radial grooves forming air gaps. The magnetic sensors are disposed within the air gaps and work to measure magnetic flux densities in the air gaps. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,528,139 to Oudet et al., issued Jun. 18, 1996 (corresponding to Japanese Patent No. 2842482) teaches such a type of angular position sensor.",
        "The N-pole and the S-pole of the magnet are disposed at an angular interval of 180\u00b0 and create a magnetic flux density changing at a constant rate in the circumferential direction of the magnet. This causes the magnetic flux density as measured by the magnetic sensors to change in the form of a sine wave upon rotation of the rotary shaft. It is, thus, impossible for the magnetic sensors to measure the magnetic flux density that is higher in linearity. Determination of an absolute angular position of the rotary shaft requires large-scaled operations on trigonometric functions and/or using a map, thus posing the problem that the operation load on the system is undesirably high.",
        "It is therefore a principal object of the invention to avoid the disadvantages of the prior art.",
        "It is another object of the invention to provide an angular position sensor designed to measure a magnetic flux density that is higher in linearity.",
        "According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided an angular position sensor which may be employed in electric power steering devices for automotive vehicles. The angular position sensor comprises: (a) a hard magnetic member connected to a rotary member, the hard magnetic member having a circumference and magnetized in a circumferential direction thereof to produce a magnetic field therearound; (b) a soft magnetic member disposed within the magnetic field produced by the hard magnetic member to form a magnetic circuit, rotation of the rotary member to change a relative position between the magnetic field and the hard magnetic member causes a magnetic flux density in the magnetic circuit to change; and (c) a magnetic flux density measuring sensor disposed at an interval away from the soft magnetic member. The magnetic flux density measuring sensor works to measure the magnetic flux density in the magnetic circuit to produce a signal as a function of the magnetic flux density as indicating an angular position of the rotary member. The hard magnetic member is so designed as to create magnetic flux that is substantially uniform in amount within a given angular range in a circumferential direction thereof, thereby causing the density of magnetic flux developed in the magnetic circuit to change substantially in proportion to a change in angular position of the rotary member, which enables the angular position sensor to provide a change in output that is higher in linearity upon rotation of the rotary member.",
        "In the preferred mode of the invention, the hard magnetic member has a first magnetic pole and a second magnetic pole which are different in polarity from each other and joined at ends thereof together to define the circumference of the hard magnetic member. The first and second magnetic poles work to create the magnetic flux that is substantially uniform in amount within angular ranges defined around central portions of the first and second magnetic poles in the circumferential direction of the hard magnetic member. This structure provides a change in amount of the magnetic flux produced upon rotation of the rotary member in the form of substantially a rectangular wave within the angular range around the central portion of each of the first and second magnetic poles.",
        "The central portions of the first and second magnetic poles may have a thickness defined in a direction perpendicular to a plane extending over the circumference of the hard magnetic member which is smaller than a thickness of portions of the first and second magnetic poles around interfaces between ends of the first and second magnetic poles. Specifically, the central portions of the first and second magnetic poles are thinner, in other words, peripheral areas of the first and second magnetic poles are smaller than those of the portions around the interfaces between the ends of the first and second magnetic poles, so that a total amount of magnetic flux produced from the central portions are decreased as compared with when the first and second magnetic poles have the thickness that is uniform over the circumference of the hard magnetic member, thereby resulting in the uniformity of the amount of magnetic flux within the angular ranges defined around the central portions of the first and second magnetic poles.",
        "The central portions of the first and second magnetic poles may alternatively have a width defined in a direction oriented parallel to a plane extending cover the circumference of the hard magnetic member which is smaller than a width of the portions of the first and second magnetic poles around the interfaces between ends of the first and second magnetic poles. Specifically, the peripheral areas of the first and second magnetic poles are smaller than those of the portions around the interfaces between the ends of the first and second magnetic poles, so that a total amount of magnetic flux produced from the central portions are decreased as compared with when the first and second magnetic poles have the width that is uniform over the circumference of the hard magnetic member, thereby resulting in the uniformity of the amount of magnetic flux within the angular ranges defined around the central portions of the first and second magnetic poles.",
        "The hard magnetic member may alternatively have sub-soft magnetic members which work to convert magnetic flux generated from the first and second magnetic poles into the magnetic flux that is substantially uniform in amount within the given angular range. The sub-soft magnetic members are disposed on outer peripheries of the central portions of the first and second magnetic poles.",
        "In the structure wherein the hard magnetic member has the thickness defined in the direction perpendicular to a plane extending over the circumference thereof which is smaller than that of the soft magnetic member, the hard magnetic member and the soft magnetic member may be so disposed that a plane defined on a circumferential center line of the hard magnetic member in a thickness-wise direction thereof coincides with a plane defined on a circumferential center line of the soft magnetic member in a thickness-wise direction thereof. This structure serves to keep the hard magnetic member inside the soft magnetic member in a thickness-wise direction of the hard magnetic member even if a slight shift between the hard magnetic member and the soft magnetic member occurs in the thickness-wise direction of the hard magnetic member, thereby minimizing a change in magnetic flux density to be measured by the magnetic flux density measuring sensor.",
        "The angular position sensor may further comprise a magnetic shield which surrounds the soft magnetic member to minimize an error of a sensor output arising from external magnetic disturbances.",
        "The soft magnetic member may have a circumference and be disposed outside the circumference of the hard magnetic member. The soft magnetic member may have a first, a second, a third, and a fourth gap formed therein at an interval of approximately 90\u00b0 in a circumferential direction of the soft magnetic member. A distance between an outer periphery of the soft magnetic member and the magnetic shield is greater than a length of each of the first to fourth gaps in the circumferential direction of the soft magnetic member, thereby avoiding leakage of the magnetic flux from the soft magnetic member to the magnetic shield.",
        "The widths of the first and second magnetic poles of the hard magnetic member defined in the direction perpendicular to the plane extending over the circumferential direction of the hard magnetic member may decrease toward circumferential centers of the first and second magnetic poles. Specifically, the peripheral areas around the circumferential centers of the first and second magnetic poles are smaller than those of the portions around the interfaces between the ends of the first and second magnetic poles, so that a total amount of magnetic flux produced from the central portions are decreased as compared with when the first and second magnetic poles have the width that is uniform over the circumference of the hard magnetic member, thereby resulting in the uniformity of the amount of magnetic flux within the angular ranges defined around the central portions of the first and second magnetic poles.",
        "Each of the hard magnetic member and the soft magnetic member may have a circular inner circumference. The hard magnetic member may have substantially circular outer circumference defined by geometry that widths of the circumferential centers of the first and second magnetic poles in the direction perpendicular to the circumferential direction of the hard magnetic member are smaller than widths of interfaces between the first and second magnetic poles.",
        "In the structure wherein the thickness of the hard magnetic member in the direction perpendicular to the plane extending over the circumference of the hard magnetic member is greater than that of the soft magnetic member, ends of the hard magnetic member opposed in the direction perpendicular to the plane extending over the circumference of the hard magnetic member may project outside ends of the soft magnetic member in the direction perpendicular to the circumference of the hard magnetic member. This causes the magnetic flux to flow from corners of the hard magnetic member out of the soft magnetic member which serves to attract incoming iron powders to avoid sticking thereof to the inner periphery of the soft magnetic member and an opposed portion of the outer periphery of the hard magnetic member, thus ensuring the stability of flow of magnetic flux from the hard magnetic member to the inner periphery of the soft magnetic member for an extended period of time.",
        "According to the second aspect of the invention, there is provided an angular position determining apparatus which comprises: (A) an angular position sensor including (a) a hard magnetic member connected to a rotary member, the hard magnetic member having a circumference and magnetized in a circumferential direction thereof to produce a magnetic field therearound and working to produce magnetic flux that is substantially uniform in amount within a given angular range in a circumferential direction thereof, the hard magnetic member having a first magnetic pole and a second magnetic pole different in polarity from the first magnetic pole, the first and second magnetic poles being jointed at ends thereof at locations 180\u00b0 apart from each other in a circumferential direction of the hard magnetic member, (b) a soft magnetic member disposed outside the circumference of the hard magnetic member within the magnetic field produced by the hard magnetic member to form a magnetic circuit, rotation of the rotary member to change a relative position between the magnetic field and the hard magnetic member causes a magnetic flux density in the magnetic circuit to change, the soft magnetic member having gaps formed therein at an interval of approximately 90\u00b0, and (c) a magnetic flux density measuring sensor including a first and a second sensor element respectively disposed in two of the gaps adjacent in the circumferential direction of the soft magnetic member, the first and second sensor elements working to measure magnetic flux densities within the two gaps and produce electric signals indicative thereof; and (B) an angular position computing circuit working to computing an angular position of the rotary member based on the electric signals produced by the magnetic flux density measuring sensor. Specifically, the densities of magnetic flux produced in the gaps are 90\u00b0 out of phase with each other, so that outputs of the first and second sensor elements will also be 90\u00b0 out of phase with each other, thereby enabling the angular position computing circuit to determine the angular position of the rotary member in a full angular range.",
        "The angular position computing circuit is designed to combine the electric signals to determine the angular position of the rotary member within the full angular range.",
        "The angular position computing circuit is designed to perform at least one of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on the electric signals provided by the magnetic flux density measuring sensor, thus resulting in a decrease in operation load on the angular position computing circuit.",
        "The rotary member may be a steering shaft connected to a steering wheel of an automotive vehicle.",
        "According to the third aspect of the invention, there is provided an angular position determining apparatus which comprises: (a) a ring-shaped hard magnetic member connected to a rotary member, the hard magnetic member including a first magnetic pole and a second magnetic pole different in polarity from the first magnetic pole, the first and second magnetic poles being jointed at ends thereof at locations 180\u00b0 apart from each other in a circumferential direction of the hard magnetic member, the hard magnetic member being so designed as to create magnetic flux that is substantially uniform in amount within a given angular range in a circumferential direction thereof; (b) a soft magnetic member disposed outside a circumference of the hard magnetic member having formed therein gaps arrayed at an interval of approximately 90\u00b0, rotation of the rotary member to change a relative position between the hard magnetic member and the soft magnetic member causes a magnetic flux density in the gaps to change; (c) magnetic flux density measuring sensors disposed one in each of two of the gaps adjacent in a direction of array of the gaps, the magnetic flux density measuring sensors working to magnetic flux densities within the two gaps and produce electric signals indicative thereof which exhibit substantially triangular waves shifted 90\u00b0 apart in phase from each other and each of which has a straight portion; and (d) an angular position computing circuit working to combine and correct the straight portions of the triangular waves to form a substantially single straight line. The angular position computing circuit computes an angular position of the rotary member using the straight line. This structure serves to provide outputs of the magnetic density measuring sensors which are higher in linearity as a function of a change in angular position of the rotary member. The above combination and correction minimizes an error in determining the angular position of the rotary member.",
        "The electric signals produced by the magnetic flux density measuring sensors are voltage signals whose level change as a function of the angular position of the rotary member. The correction of the straight portions of the triangular waves is achieved in the angular position computing circuit by extracting segments from the straight portions each of which extends over one of preselected angular ranges of rotation of the rotary member, bringing signs of inclinations of the segments into agreement with each other, moving the segments in parallel to bring a voltage level of an end of each of the segments into agreement with that of an end of an adjacent one of the segments, and joining the moved segments to produce a single voltage-to-angle line, defining a straight voltage-to-angle line extending between a maximum voltage level and a minimum voltage level indicated by the single voltage-to-angle line, determining a middle voltage level intermediate between the straight voltage-to-angle line, determining a voltage correction value required to bring the middle voltage level into agreement with an ideal one, and determining an inclination correction value required to bring an inclination of the straight voltage-to-angle line into agreement with an ideal one.",
        "Each of the magnetic flux density measuring sensors may be designed to correct the electric signal so as to compensate for an error arising from an ambient temperature.",
        "Each of the magnetic flux density measuring sensors may be equipped with a temperature-to-correction value map. Each of the magnetic flux density measuring sensors works to pick up a correction value from the temperature-to-correction value map which corresponds to the ambient temperature and correct the electric signal using the correction value.",
        "The angular position computing circuit may store therein an ideal maximum voltage level and an ideal minimum voltage level of the electric signals, determine a first difference between an actual maximum voltage level of the electric signals and the ideal maximum voltage level and a second difference between an actual minimum voltage level and the ideal minimum voltage level, and correct the actual maximum and minimum voltage levels using the first and second differences. Usually, the amount of magnetic flux produced by the hard magnetic, member decreases gradually with a rise in ambient temperature, thus resulting in a decrease in magnetic flux density to be measured by the magnetic flux density measuring sensors. This will cause the voltage levels of outputs of the magnetic flux density measuring sensors to drop. In order to eliminate this problem, the angular position computing circuit is designed to compensate for the drops in voltage levels of the outputs from the magnetic flux density measuring sensors in the above manner.",

The angular position computing circuit 6 is designed to determine an angular position of the rotary shaft 2 using an output of the angular position sensor.",
        "The angular position sensor includes a magnet 3 made of a hard magnetic material, a yoke 4 made of a soft magnetic material, and a magnetic sensor 5 working to measure the density of magnetic flux.",
        "The magnet 3 is of a ring-shape and affixed to the outer periphery of the rotary shaft 2. The magnet 3 is made up of two semicircular parts: one having an N-pole 3a, and the other having an S-pole 3b. The N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b are joined integrally at ends thereof at locations 180\u00b0 far away from each other. The magnet 3 has a thickness h, as shown in FIG. 2, which decreases gradually from interfaces 3c between the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b to circumferential centers of the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b.",

Specifically, an area of a peripheral surface around the circumferential centers of the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b of the magnet 3 is smaller than that when the thickness h is constant over the entire circumference of the magnet. In other words, the amount of magnetic flux produced in the radius direction of the magnet 3 from the circumferential centers of the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b which are the greatest in magnetic flux density is decreased. This causes a total amount of magnetic flux to be almost uniform around the circumferential centers of the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b of the magnet 3.

The first and second sensor elements 5a and 5b output voltage signals having levels on a broken line II, as illustrated in FIG. 4(d).",
        "When the rotary shaft 2 further rotates 90\u00b0 in the clockwise direction from the angular position II to an angular position III, as shown in FIG. 4(c), it causes a maximum magnetic flux density of the positive polarity to be developed in the gap 41 between the first and second yoke segments 4a and 4b.

This causes the density of magnetic flux flowing out of the peripheral surface around the circumferential center of each of the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b to be constant, so that the amount of magnetic flux within the gaps 41 during rotation of the rotary shaft 2 changes at substantially a constant rate. Specifically, each of the first and second sensor elements 5a and 5b works to output a voltage signal as a function of the magnetic flux density within the gap 41 which exhibits higher linearity.",

The sub-yokes 44a and 44b are installed on the periphery of the magnet 3 near the circumferential centers of the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b and works to regulate, like the ones in FIGS. 13(a) and 13(b), an amount of magnetic flux to be substantially uniform around the circumferential centers of the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b of the magnet 3. Other arrangements are identical with those in the first embodiment, and explanation thereof in detail will be omitted here.",
        "FIGS. 15(a) and 15(b) show the angular position sensor of the angular position detector 1 according to the sixth embodiment of the invention.",
        "The magnet 3 is made of two arc-shaped magnetic members joined to each other each of which has the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b opposed to each other in the thickness-wise direction thereof (i.e., the lengthwise direction of the rotary shaft 2). The N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b are uniform in thickness over the circumference of the arc-shaped magnetic members. The magnet 3 also has, as a whole, the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b opposed to each other in the radius direction thereof. The inner diameter of the magnet 3 is, as can be seen from FIG. 15(a), greater than that of the yoke 4, while the outer diameter of the magnet 3 is smaller than that of the yoke 4. The magnet 3 is, as clearly illustrated in FIG. 15(b), opposed at an end surface thereof to an end surface of the yoke 4. Other arrangements are identical with those in the first embodiment, and explanation thereof in detail will be omitted here.",
        "The yoke 4 in each of the first to sixth embodiments is made up of four segments, but may alternatively be made up, as shown in FIGS. 16(a) and 16(b), two arc-shaped segments 4e and 4f. The yoke segments 4e and 4f are opposed at ends thereof to each other through the gaps 41 located 180\u00b0 away from each other. A magnetic sensor element 5c is disposed within one of the gaps 41. The yoke 4 may alternatively be made up of more than four segments. Other arrangements are identical with those in the first embodiment, and explanation thereof in detail will be omitted here.",
        "The angular position detector 1 of the seventh embodiment of the invention will be described below with reference to FIGS. 17 to 22.",
        "FIG. 17 demonstrates ideal waveforms of the output voltages Va and Vb of the sensor elements 5a and 5b of the magnetic sensor 5. FIG. 18 demonstrates an ideal output voltage Vl of the angular position computing circuit 6.",
        "The waveform of the output voltage Va of the sensor element 5a in an angular range of a complete turn of the rotary shaft 2 (i.e., \u2212180\u00b0 to +180\u00b0) includes straight segments Val1, Val2, and Val3. The waveform of the output voltage Vb of the sensor element 5b in the angular range of a complete turn of the rotary shaft 2 includes straight segments Vbl1 and Vbl2. The output voltages Va and Vb are of substantially a triangular shape and shifted 90\u00b0 apart in phase. The angular position computing circuit 6 works to perform the operations, as discussed in the first embodiments, to bring signs of inclinations of the straight segments Val1, Val2, Val3 Vbl1, and Vbl2 into agreement with each other and move them in parallel to form a straight line, as shown in FIG. 18, made of a combination of the straight segments Val1, Val2, Val3 Vbl1, and Vbl2. This enables the absolute angular position of the rotary shaft 2 to be determined over an angular range of 360\u00b0 correctly.",
        "The magnetic sensor 5, as described above, works to measure the amount of magnetic flux produced from the magnet 3 as the magnetic flux density. Usually, there is a variation in amount of magnetic flux produced by the magnet 3 due to a geometrical production error thereof, which will result in variations in the output voltages Va and Vb of the sensor elements 5a and 5b of the magnetic sensor 5. The variations in the output voltages Va and Vb will result in a variation in the output voltage Vl of the angular position computing circuit 6. Specifically, the level of voltage appearing at an end of each of the straight segments Val1, Val2, Val3 Vbl1, and Vbl2 (i.e., at each of joints P1, P2, P3, and P4 of the straight segments Val1, Val2, Val3 Vbl1, and Vbl2) may not agree with that of an adjacent one of the straight segments Val1, Val2, Val3 Vbl1, and Vbl2, thus resulting in shifts between the straight segments Val1, Val2, Val3 Vbl1, and Vbl2 on the line of FIG. 18.",
        "In order to avoid the above problem, the angular position computing circuit 6 of this embodiment is designed to correct the output voltages Va and Vb of the sensor elements 5a and 5b of the magnetic sensor 5, as discussed below, to ensure the linearity of the waveform of the output voltage Vl of the angular position computing circuit 6.",
        "FIG. 19 shows actual examples of periodic waves of the output voltages Va and Vb of the sensor elements 5a and 5b of the magnetic sensor 5. FIG. 20 shows an output voltage LH of the angular position computing circuit 6 in the event that the straight segments Val1, Val2, Val3 Vbl1, and Vbl2 (as expressed by La1, La2, La3, Lb1, and Lb2 in the drawing) of the waveforms of the output voltages Va and Vb are out of alignment with each other. FIG. 21 shows the output voltage LH of the angular position computing circuit 6 after voltages appearing at the joints P1, P2, P3, and P4 of the straight segments La1, La2, La3, Lb1, and Lb2 are corrected. FIG. 22 is a flowchart of logical steps or a program performed by the angular position computing circuit 6 to ensure the linearity of the waveform of the output voltage LH.",
        "After entering the program, the routine proceeds to step 100 wherein two intersections Xmax and Xmin, as shown in FIG. 19, of the waveforms of the output voltages Va and Vb resulting from a 90\u00b0 shift in phase thereof are found to determine output voltages VXH and VHL appearing at the intersections Xmax and Xmin.",
        "The routine proceeds to step 101 wherein a middle voltage VXM between the output voltages VXH and VHL, as determined in step 100, is calculated according to an equation below.\n\nVXM=(VXH+VXL)/2",
        "The routine proceeds to step 102 wherein the same operations as those in FIG. 5 are executed to determine locations (i.e., voltages) of ends of the straight segments La1, La2, La3, Lb1, and Lb2, as illustrated in FIG. 20, to be connected together (i.e., the joints P1, P2, P3, and P4). In execution of the program of FIG. 5, 3.0V in step 1 is replaced with the output voltage VXH, 2.0V in step 2 is replaced with the output voltage VXL, and 2.5V in step 4 is replaced with the middle voltage VXM.",
        "A manner of determining the joints P1, P2, P3, and P4 will be described below in detail.",
        "Each of voltage levels P10 to P17 at ends of the straight segments La1, La2, La3, Lb1, and Lb2, as illustrated in FIG. 20, to be connected together are, as described above, does not identical with that of an adjacent one. Thus, the straight segment Lb1 is first moved in parallel until a difference between the voltage P11 of the straight segment Lb1 and the voltage P11 of the straight segment La3 decreases to zero. In other words, the straight segment Lb1 is moved while keeping an inclination thereof as it is to bring the voltage P11 into agreement in level with the voltage P10 of the straight segment La3. Similarly, the straight segment La1 is moved in parallel to bring the voltage P13 thereof into agreement with the voltage P12 of the parallel-moved straight segment Lb1. The straight segment Lb2 is moved in parallel to bring the voltage P15 thereof into agreement with the voltage P14 of the parallel-moved straight segment La1. Finally, the straight segment La2 is moved in parallel to bring the voltage P17 thereof into agreement with the voltage P16 of the parallel-moved straight segment Lb2. This makes a single line. The voltage P18 at the end of the straight segment La2 after moved parallel is illustrated as a maximum voltage P18a in FIG. 21. For ease of visibility, the maximum voltage P18a is illustrated in FIG. 21 as being much higher than 4.5V.",
        "Next, a straight line LH is defined, as shown in FIG. 21, which extends between the minimum voltage P9 and the maximum voltage P1 8a at the parallel-moved straight segment La2. A middle voltage value VM between the value VH of the maximum voltage P1 8a and the value VL of the minimum voltage P9 is determined using the following equation.\n\nVM=(VH+VL)/2",
        "Afterwards, the routine proceeds to step 103. The middle voltage value VM is not always identical with a middle voltage value 2.5V on the ideal straight line VI, as indicated by a dotted line in FIGS. 20 and 21. Thus, a middle voltage correcting value Vofs is determined in accordance with an equation below to correct the middle voltage value VM to 2.5V.\n\nVofs=VM\u22122.5",
        "The routine proceeds to step 104. The inclination K of the line LH extending between the maximum and minimum voltages P9 and P1 8a is not always identical with an inclination of the ideal line Vl. Thus, an inclination correcting value Kf is determined in accordance with an equation below to bring the inclination K into agreement with that of the ideal line Vl.\n\nKf=4/(VH\u2212Vl)",
        "The routine proceeds to step 104 wherein an actual output voltage Vj of the angular position computing circuit 6 is corrected in accordance with an equation below using the middle voltage correcting value Vofs and the inclination correcting value Kf to produce an output voltage Vout\u2032.\n\nVout\u2032=(Vj\u22122.5+Vofs)\u00d7Kf+2.5",
        "The above correction works to bring the output voltage Vout\u2032 of the angular position computing circuit 6 nearly into agreement with an ideal output voltage. Specifically, the line made up of the straight segments La1, La2, La3, Lb1, and Lb2 in the parallel-moving operation in step 102 is corrected, as indicated by a solid line in FIG. 21, to almost overlap the ideal line Vl made up of segments VaL1, VaL2, VaL3, VbL1, and VbL2. An output voltage range of the angular position computing circuit 6 is also adjusted to an ideal output voltage range of 0.5V to 4.5V. The above operations enable the angular position computing circuit 6 to work to measure an absolute angular position of the rotary shaft 2 over a full range of 360\u00b0 with minimum errors.",
        "As apparent from the above discussion, correction values used to connect the straight segments La1, La2, La3, Lb1, and Lb2 at the joints P1, P2, P3, and P4 in the parallel-moving operation in step 102 are different from each other, thus resulting in an increased operation load on the angular position computing circuit 6. Usually, a steering wheel of automotive vehicles stays at a neutral position (angular position of zero (0\u00b0)) for the longest period of time. Therefore, in a case where the angular position detector 1 is installed in the automotive electric power steering device 11 of FIG. 11, a decrease in number of operations to determine the joints P1, P2, P3, and P4, in other words, a decrease in operation load on the angular position computing circuit 6 is accomplished by setting angular positions of the joints P1, P2, P3, and P4 to any angular positions other than the neutral position of the steering wheel. The setting of the angular positions of the joints P1, P2, P3, and P4 to any angular positions other than the neutral position of the steering wheel is achieved by moving the magnet 3 in a circumferential direction of the rotary shaft 2 (i.e., the steering shaft) upon installation on the rotary shaft 2.",
        "The waveforms of the output voltages Va and Vb of the sensor elements 5a and 5b, as illustrated in FIG. 19, are unchanged. A further decrease in operation load on the angular position computing circuit 6 may be achieved by rotating the steering wheel over 360\u00b0 one time in either of clockwise and counterclockwise directions to determine the middle voltage correcting value Vofs and the inclination correcting value Kf as fixed initial values.",
        "The angular position detector 1 of the eighth embodiment will be described below with reference to FIG. 23.",
        "FIG. 23 demonstrates actual and ideal periodic waveforms of the output voltages Va and Vb of the sensor elements 5a and 5b of the magnetic sensor 5.",
        "Usually, the amount of magnetic flux produced by the magnet 3 decreases gradually with a rise in ambient temperature, thus resulting in a decrease in magnetic flux density to be measured by the sensor elements 5a and 5b. This will cause the output voltages Va and Vb of the sensor elements 5a and 5b to drop. In order to eliminate this problem, the angular position detector 1 of this embodiment is designed to compensate for the drops in output voltages Va and Vb of the sensor elements 5a and 5b arising from a rise in ambient temperature. This compensation will be described below in detail.",
        "In FIG. 23, broken lines Vam and Vbm represent the ideal waveforms of the output voltages Va and Vb, respectively. Solid lines Vaj and Vbj represent the actual waveforms of the output voltages Va and Vb, respectively.",
        "The magnetic sensor 5 is equipped with a temperature sensor (not shown) which works to measure the temperature around the magnetic sensor 5. Some of available Hall sensors are equipped with a temperature compensating function. The first and second sensor elements 5a and 5b of this embodiment are each implemented by the Hall sensor. Specifically, the first and second sensor elements 5a and 5b have installed therein a temperature-to-correction value map for use in brining the actual output voltages Vaj and Vbj of the sensor elements 5a and 5b into agreement with the ideal output voltages Vam and Vbm, respectively. The temperature-to-correction value map is preselected in terms of type of the magnet 3 and/or the amount of magnetic flux generated by the magnet 3.",
        "Specifically, the magnetic sensor 5 monitors the ambient temperature, selects correction values from the temperature-to-correction value maps, and corrects the actual output voltages Vaj and Vbj into agreement with the ideal output voltages Vam and Vbm, respectively, thereby compensating for the drops in output voltages Va and Vb of the sensor elements 5a and 5b due to a temperature characteristic of the magnet 3.",
        "Instead of compensating for the drops in output voltages Va and Vb of the sensor elements 5a and 5b in themselves, the angular position computing circuit 6 may be designed to perform operations, as discussed below, to bring the actual output voltages Vaj and Vbj into agreement with the ideal output voltages Vam and Vbm, respectively. Specifically, maximum values Vammax and Vbmmax and minimum values Vammin and Vbmmin of the ideal output voltages Vam and Vbm are prestored in the angular position computing circuit 6. The angular position computing circuit 6 calculates differences Hmax between a maximum value Vajmax of the actual output voltage Vaj and Vammax and between a maximum value Vbjmax of the actual output voltage Vbj and between Vbmmax and differences Hmin between a minimum value Vajmin of the actual output voltage Vaj and Vammin and between a minimum value Vbjmin of the actual output voltage Vbj and Vbmmin and corrects the maximum values Vajmax and Vbjmax and the minimum values Vajmin and Vbjmin of the actual output voltages Vaj and Vbj using the differences Hmax and Hmin so as to bring the actual output voltages Vaj and Vbj into agreement with the ideal output voltages Vam and Vbm.",
        "The angular position detector 1 according to the ninth embodiment will be described below with reference to FIGS. 24(a), 24(b), and 25. FIG. 24(a) shows the angular position sensor of the angular position detector 1 equipped with the magnet 3, as illustrated in FIG. 12(b). FIG. 24(b) shows the angular position sensor of the angular position detector 1 equipped with the magnet 3 of this embodiment. In FIG. 24(b), a broken line indicates a profile of the magnet 3 of FIG. 24(a). FIG. 25 demonstrates a periodic wave indicating a change in amount of magnetic flux \u03c6 which is generated by the magnet 3 of FIG. 24(b) and measured by the sensor elements 5a and 5b of the magnetic sensor 5 as a function of an angular position \u03b8 of the rotary shaft 2.",
        "The magnet 3, as illustrated in FIG. 12(b), has a circular inner periphery and an oval outer periphery. In a case, as illustrated in FIG. 24(a), where the magnet of FIG. 12(b) is disposed within the yoke 4 whose inner periphery is circular, the distance G between the circumferential centers of the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b of the magnet 3 and the inner periphery of the yoke 4 is much greater than the distance between interfaces between the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b and the inner periphery of the yoke 4. This causes the amount of magnetic flux which is generated around the circumferential centers of the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b and leaks out of the yoke 4 to increase, thus resulting in a decreased density of magnetic flux flowing through the yoke 4, which leads to a decrease in output of the magnetic sensor 5.",
        "In order to avoid the above problem, the magnet 3 has the interfaces between the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b ground or cut to have flat side surfaces 130a and 130b. This permits the width of the circumferential centers of the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b in the radius direction of the magnet 3 to be increased more than that of the magnet 3, as illustrated in FIG. 24(a). Specifically, the gap G between the circumferential centers of the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b and the inner periphery of the yoke 4 is allowed to be smaller than that in FIG. 24(a). This results in a decreased leakage of magnetic flux outside the yoke 4.",
        "The magnet 3 of FIG. 24(b) is, as apparent from the above, substantially circular as compared with that of FIG. 24(a). The width of the circumferential centers of the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b and the width of the interfaces between the N-pole 3a and the S-pole 3b are so selected as to have a relation therebetween which produces the magnetic flux changing in the form of a wave, as illustrated in FIG. 25, upon rotation of the rotary shaft 2. Specifically, the amounts of magnetic flux within a range X (i.e., around the circumferential center of the N-pole 3a) and a range Y (around the circumferential center of the N-pole 3b) are substantially uniform.",
        "FIG. 26 shows the angular position sensor of the angular position detector 1 according to the tenth embodiment of the invention.",
        "The yoke 4 in each of the first to ninth embodiments is, as described above, made of a metallic soft magnetic material. The yoke 4 of this embodiment is made up of four soft magnetic plates 4a, 4b, 4c, and 4d whose thickness in the radius direction of the yoke 4 is smaller than that of the yoke segments 4a to 4d in each of the first to ninth embodiments. The magnetic plates 4a to 4d of this embodiment are each formed by press such as punching or bending and smaller in weight than the yoke segments 4a to 4d in each of the first to ninth embodiments by the volume S.",
        "The magnetic plates 4a to 4d may alternatively be formed by grinding metallic blocks.",
        "FIGS. 27(a) and 27(b) show the angular position sensor of the angular position detector 1 according to the eleventh embodiment of the invention.",
        "The magnet 3 of FIG. 27(a) has a profile identical with that of FIG. 24(a) or FIG. 24(b), but different therefrom in that the thickness B is greater than the thickness C of the yoke 4. Specifically, corners 31 of the magnet 3 are located outside the yoke 4 in the lengthwise direction of the rotary shaft 2. This causes the magnetic flux to flow from the corners 31 out of the yoke 4 which serves to attract incoming iron powders to avoid sticking thereof to the inner periphery of the yoke 4 and an opposed portion of the outer periphery of the magnet 3, thus ensuring the stability of flow of magnetic flux from the magnet 3 to the inner periphery of the yoke 4 for an extended period of time.",
        "The magnet 3 may be made integrally with the rotary shaft 2 using insert-molding techniques. This improves cocentricity of the magnet 3 and the rotary shaft 2.",
        "FIG. 27(b) shows a modification of the magnet 3 of FIG. 27(a).",
        "The magnet 3 is affixed to the rotary shaft 2 through a ring-shaped resinous magnet holder 9. The magnet holder 9 may be formed integrally with the rotary shaft 2 using insert-molding techniques. The magnet 3 may be made of a ferrite magnet or a plastic bonded magnet.",
