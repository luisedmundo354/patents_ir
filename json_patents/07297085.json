        "The present invention relates to a power transmission having at least two planetary gear sets and three modal torque-transmitting mechanisms successively engagable with other torque-transmitting mechanisms to provide three modes of speed ratios with single transition shifts.",
        "Currently available transmissions for heavy working machinery typically have a multi-speed \u201cinput\u201d section driving into either a two-speed high/low ratio \u201csplitter\u201d section or a three speed high/medium/low ratio \u201csplitter\u201d section. By successively engaging torque-transmitting mechanisms in the input section (\u201cinput torque-transmitting mechanisms\u201d) with the splitter section torque-transmitting mechanisms a shift sequence is achieved. For instance, if the input section includes torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B, C and the splitter section includes torque-transmitting mechanisms low (L), medium (M) and high (H) then the shift sequence would be AL-BL-CL-AM-BM-CM-AH-BH-CH. This shift sequence has single transition shifting except for two undesirable center shifts, i.e., CL to AM and CM to AH. These are double transition shifts which compromise shift quality, shift time and durability of the internal gears.",
        "The present invention provides an improved transmission, especially for heavy working machinery, with a high number of ratios, very uniform steps and low internal speeds. The transmission has two \u201crear\u201d planetary gear sets that are uniquely constructed to provide modal operation as explained herein. A \u201cfront\u201d section provides power flow input to the rear planetary gear sets using either a modal torque-transmitting mechanism or an input torque-transmitting mechanism, providing multiple input speed ratios. The rear two planetary gear sets are operatively connected with two other modal torque-transmitting mechanisms and a reverse brake. The transmission provides up to three ratios in a first mode, a first transition speed ratio between the first mode and the second mode, up to three additional speed ratios in the second mode, a second transition speed ratio between the second mode and a third mode, and up to three speed ratios in the third mode. Thus, if three input torque-transmitting mechanisms are provided, potentially eleven speed ratios (or corresponding torque ratios) may be achieved. Up to three reverse ratios may be achieved. The third mode speed ratios may include one or more overdrive ratios or the transmission may operate without overdrive depending on gear tooth counts selected.",
        "In the transmission, input to the rear planetary gear sets from the multi-speed input torque-transmitting mechanisms increases in the first mode, decreases in the second mode and increases again in the third mode.",

Speed ratio, as used herein, is the ratio of the speed of the output member to the speed of the input member. Torque ratio is the ratio of the torque of the output member to the torque of the input member. As torque ratio decreases, speed ratio increases.",
        "Additionally, the first and second modal torque-transmitting mechanisms may be simultaneously engagable to establish a first transition speed ratio between the input member and the output member, with a single transition shift between the first transition speed ratio and both of said first and second modal speed ratios.

Similarly, the second modal torque-transmitting mechanism and the third modal torque-transmitting mechanism may be simultaneously engaged to establish a second transition speed ratio between the input member and the output member, with a single transition shift between the second transition speed ratio and both of the second and third modal speed ratios. The second transition speed ratio has a numerical value greater than the second modal speed ratio and less than the third modal speed ratio. The ability of the transmission to provide the first and second transition speed ratios eliminates undesirable double transition shifts typically encountered with transmissions having a \u201csplitter\u201d section.",

        "The reverse torque-transmitting mechanism enables an unique lock-out feature. Specifically, engagement of the reverse torque-transmitting mechanism with the first modal torque-transmitting mechanism prevents rotation of the output member to prevent rolling on steep grades.",
        "The input torque-transmitting mechanisms may be operatively connected to additional planetary gear sets or to gears in a counter-shaft layout located between the input member and the first and second planetary gear sets. If three input torque-transmitting mechanisms are provided, up to eleven speed ratios may be achieved, although as few as seven may be utilized depending on the step and ratios desired. For instance, a direct, single overdrive or dual overdrive top ratio may be utilized.

The planetary transmission 14 includes a front section 11 (also referred to as an input section) configured to establish power flow to a rear section 15 (also referred to as an output section) to establish various speed ratios between the input member 17 and the output member 19. The front section 11 may be comprised of planetary gear sets or may be a countershaft gear arrangement. The rear section 15 includes first and second planetary gear sets which may be referred to herein as modal planetary gear sets. The front section 11 includes multiple input section torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B, and C, as well as a second mode clutch (MII). The rear section 15 includes a first mode brake (MI) engagable to ground a member of one of the modal planetary gear sets to the transmission housing. The rear section 15 also includes a reverse brake (REV) selectively engagable to ground different members of the modal planetary gear sets to the transmission housing. Additionally, a third mode clutch (MIII) is selectively engagable to connect any two members of one of the modal planetary gear sets. When only one of the input section torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B or C is engaged and clutch MIl is not engaged, power flow is established between the front section 11 and the rear section 15 only along power flow path D. If the MII clutch is engaged and none of the input torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B, C are engaged, power flow is established between the front section 11 and the rear section 15 only along the power flow path E.

The carrier member 49, and therefore the output member 19, rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the ring gear member 44 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 40. The numerical value of the sixth forward speed ratio is determined utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets 40 and 50.",

The carrier member 69 and the ring gear member 54 rotate at the same speed as the input member 17. The carrier member 59, the ring gear member 44, the carrier member 49, the planetary gear set 30, the sun gear member 22 and the carrier member 29 rotate at the same speed as the output member 19. The sun gear member 52 does not rotate. The carrier member 59, and therefore the output member 19, rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the ring gear member 54 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 50.

Because the carrier member 29 also rotates at the same speed as the output member 19, the input member 17 rotates at the same speed as the output member 19 in this configuration, providing a direct drive ratio.",
        "The ninth forward speed ratio is established with the engagement of the brake C and the clutch MIII. The brake C connects the sun gear member 62 with the transmission housing 80, and the clutch MIII connects the carrier member 39 with the sun gear member 32.

Chart of FIG. 3 also provides an example of torque ratios that are available utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios as follows: the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 20 is 3.96; the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 30 is 4.65; the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 40 is 3.26; the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 50 is 3.26; and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 60 is 3.57.",
        "Also, the chart of FIG. 3 describes the ratio steps that are obtained utilizing the tooth ratio values listed above. For example, the step ratio between the first and second forward torque ratio is 1.31, while the step ratio between the second and third forward torque ratio is 1.28. It is apparent from FIG. 3 that the first three forward speed ratios are established with the engagement of the first mode brake MI while the input torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B and C are engaged in succeeding order. The fourth, fifth and sixth speed ratios are attained with the engagement of the second mode brake MII. The fourth forward speed ratio is a transition speed ratio in which the brake MI and the clutch MII are engaged, while the sixth forward speed ratio is a transition ratio in which the clutch MII and the brake MIII are engaged. The seventh, eighth and ninth forward speed ratios establish the third mode in which the clutch MIII is engaged while the input torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B and C are engaged in succeeding order. Only the ninth forward speed ratio is an overdrive ratio. Accordingly, as most of the forward speed ratios are underdrive ratios, lower internal speeds are maintained. Alternatively, the highest speed ratio could be an overdrive ratio, or two overdrive ratios could be provided, depending on engine speeds, vehicle speeds, axles available, and internal design considerations. Single transition shifts are employed in the forward speed ratios as well as the reverse speed ratios as is evident from FIG. 3.",
        "The transmission 114 of FIG. 2 is able to \u201clock\u201d the output member 19 by engaging the brake REV and the brake MI. If a vehicle having transmission 114 is parked on a grade, wheels interconnected with the output member 19 will transfer a gravity-induced torque to the output member 19, which may attempt to rotate the carrier member 29. If the output member 19 attempts to rotate in a clockwise direction, the carrier member 29 and the ring gear member 34, interconnected by interconnecting member 78, will attempt to also rotate in a clockwise direction. Because the ring gear member 24 is braked by brake MI, this will cause the sun gear member 22 to attempt to rotate in a clockwise direction as well. With the ring gear member 34 attempting to rotate in a clockwise direction, because the carrier member 39 is braked by brake REV, the pinion gears 37 will attempt to rotate in a clockwise direction, causing the sun gear member 32 to attempt to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction. Because the interconnecting member 79 connects the sun gear member 22 with the sun gear member 32, with the sun gear member 22 attempting to rotate in a clockwise direction, and the sun gear member 32 attempting to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, rotation is prevented.",
        "It is apparent from the above descriptions of the respective torque ratios listed in FIG. 3 that the engagement of any of the input torque-transmitting mechanisms A, B or C affects power flow to and therefore the speed of the sun gear member 32. The power flow to the sun gear member 32 is along the interconnecting member 72 which is comparable to the torque flow path D of FIG. 1. When the brake MII is engaged, power flow from the front section 11 to the rear section 15 is affected through the interconnecting member 76 as the planetary gear set 40 is made active. Interconnecting member 76 is comparable to the power flow path E of FIG. 1.

Each of the nine forward speed ratios (corresponding to torque ratios indicated in FIG. 3) is plotted in FIG. 4 as follows: point F represents the first speed ratio, point G represents the second speed ratio, point H represents the third speed ratio, point I represent the fourth speed ratio, point J represents the fifth speed ratio, point K represents the sixth speed ratio, point L represents the seventh speed ratio, point M represents the eighth speed ratio and point N represents the ninth speed ratio. Thus, points F, G and H represent the first modal speed ratios (establishing the first mode) while point I represents the first transition speed ratio, the fourth speed ratio. Point J represents a second modal speed ratio (establishing the second mode) while point K represents the second transition speed ratio, the sixth forward speed ratio.

Torque ratios as well as ratio steps associated with the speed ratios are listed. Speed ratios are indicated by the numbers 1-7, R2 and R1. The first and second forward speed ratios are first modal speed ratios (because the brake MI is engaged with the input torque-transmitting mechanisms B and C, respectively) to establish a first mode. The third forward speed ratio is a first transition speed ratio. The fourth forward speed ratio is a second modal speed ratio because brake MII is engaged with clutch C thereby establishing a second mode. The fifth forward speed ratio is a second transition speed ratio. The sixth and seventh forward speed ratios are third modal speed ratios (because the clutch MIII is engaged with the input torque-transmitting mechanisms B and C, respectively) to establish the third mode. The engagement schedule depicted in FIG. 23 involves single transition shifts. Additionally, the first forward ratio as well as the first reverse speed ratio provide a deep start ratio. Also, the highest speed ratio (indicated at 7 in the chart of FIG. 24) is a direct ratio. Thus, seven forward speed ratios are provided with low internal speeds, as there are no overdrive ratios. Transmission 1314 is designed to provide the close ratio steps listed in FIG. 24. The listed torque ratios and ratio steps result from the following ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the transmission 1314 of FIG. 23: the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 1320 is 3.0; the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 1330 is 3.8; the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 1340 is 2.88; and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 1350 is 2.88.",
