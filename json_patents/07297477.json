        "Retroviruses are major pathogens that can affect all vertebrates causing an extremely wide range of responses in infected animal hosts. For example, one of the most potent and lethal retroviruses is HIV-1, the agent that causes AIDS. Retroviruses are a large and diverse family of viruses that replicate by a unique process that is significantly different from other forms of viruses. The virion particles that make up retroviruses contain (+) strand genomic RNA. When the retrovirus enters a host cell, the (+) strand RNA is converted into double-stranded DNA through action of the enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT). This double-stranded DNA copy of the viral genome is called proviral DNA. The proviral DNA is then integrated into the host chromosomal DNA for replication by the action of the enzyme integrase (IN). Integration links the ends of linear proviral DNA to host genomic DNA. In a productive infection, proviral DNA acts as a template for the formation of retroviral particles and transcription of viral proteins, through the action of host RNA polymerase II. As integration of proviral DNA is necessary for replication, infected cells without integrated proviral DNA cannot spread infection. The formation of the integrated provirus is believed responsible for maintaining a persistent infection, for permanent entry into the host germ line and for mutagenic or oncogenic activities.",
        "Current methods, licensed and approved by the FDA, for study of retroviruses such as HIV, include antibody-based assays, where antibodies are detected using ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) or EIA (enzyme immunoassay) methods. PCR-based methods have also been used to study retroviruses. In these assays, DNA is detected by PCR amplification with virus-specific primers.",

Many viruses, including retroviruses and DNA tumor viruses undergo integration. After the RNA genome of the virus is reverse transcribed into a DNA genome, it is integrated into the genomic DNA of the host cell, through the action of the integrase enzyme. This integration event provides a tag that marks a particular time in evolution and can be used as a way to study speciation, divergence, etc. The integration event can be used to determine the mode of action of antiviral drugs, such as integrase inhibitors, for example.",
        "The subject matter described herein is directed to methods for distinguishing a latent viral infection from a productive viral infection. In particular, the description herein relates to a method for detecting a virulent infection in a host cell. In an embodiment, DNA binding proteins are crosslinked to proviral DNA (if present) and genomic DNA in a host cell. The DNA bound by protein and DNA that remains unbound are cleaved to generate DNA fragments that contain DNA-binding protein bound to genomic DNA and/or proviral DNA. In a portion of the sample, the DNA fragments are enriched by immunoprecipitation. The enriched DNA fragments are isolated from the protein, amplified and labeled. The amplified and labeled fragments are then hybridized to an array containing oligonucleotides complementary to either proviral DNA or host genomic DNA. Enriched DNA fragments that selectively hybridize to oligonucleotides complementary to proviral DNA are used to indicate a virulent infection.",
        "The methods herein can be used to detect and analyze latent and virulent states of multiple retroviruses at the same time. For example, the method can be used to identify particular HIV strains infecting a patient and whether the virus is in its latent or virulent state. Alternatively, the methods can be used to determine whether the presence of proviral DNA influences transcription of other genes. Therefore, the methods provide an effective and high-throughput screening tool for retrovirus activity.",
        "The present description is directed also to methods for studying the integration of viral DNA in the genome. In an embodiment, viral DNA binding proteins are crosslinked to proviral DNA (if present) and genomic DNA in a host cell. The DNA bound by protein and DNA that remains unbound are cleaved to generate DNA fragments that contain DNA-binding protein bound to proviral DNA or genomic DNA. The DNA fragments are isolated from the protein, and amplified and labeled. The amplified and labeled fragments are then hybridized to DNA with sequences complementary to either proviral DNA or host genomic DNA sequences. DNA fragments that selectively hybridize to proviral DNA sequences are used to identify proviral DNA that has been integrated into the host genome. In a further embodiment, DNA fragments that selectively hybridize to proviral DNA sequences are used to identify the location on the host genome where the proviral DNA is integrated (i.e. the integration site).",
        "The methods described herein can be used to analyze the mutagenic activity of retroviruses. For example, the insertion of proviral DNA into the host genome causes gross alterations in the genome. If such an insertion leads to tumor formation, the methods described herein can be used to determine the location of proviral insertion and thereby identify new oncogenes. The methods described herein provide an effective tool for detecting genetic alterations and the effect of such alterations on normal cell growth and metabolism.",
        "In embodiments, methods for detecting and distinguishing between non-infected, latent viral infection and virulent/productive viral infections in a DNA sample are described below.",
        "In an embodiment, the methods are used to detect proviral DNA, either in the latent or productive state in a sample from a host organism. DNA binding proteins are crosslinked to proviral DNA (if any) and genomic DNA in the sample. In a portion of the sample, the DNA fragments are enriched by immunoprecipitation with an antibody against a protein that is actively transcribed in an infected host cell. In an aspect, the DNA fragments are enriched by immunoprecipitation with an antibody against RNA polymerase II, or its subunits or helpers. The crosslinking is reversed and the enriched DNA is amplified and labeled. In another portion of the sample, the DNA that has not been enriched by immunoprecipitation is amplified and labeled. Both enriched and unenriched pools of labeled DNA are probed for hybridization to complementary genomic and proviral DNA. In an embodiment, one or more microarrays are used to probe for hybridization to complementary genomic and proviral DNA in the enriched and unenriched pools of labeled DNA. In a further embodiment, the enriched and unenriched pools of DNA are differentially labeled, using fluorophores such as Cy5 or Cy3, for example, and the labeled pools of DNA are then hybridized to a single DNA microarray including both proviral sequences and genomic sequences. In a still further embodiment, stringent hybridization conditions are employed.",
        "In an embodiment, latent retroviral infection is detected in a sample comprising genomic DNA according to the method illustrated in FIG. 4. The sample DNA 119 being tested contains both host (genomic) DNA 120 and proviral DNA 122. A first portion of the sample DNA is amplified by LM-PCR (represented by arrow 124), and labeled with a first label (arrow 126) resulting in first labeled DNA fragments 128. A second portion of the sample DNA is cross-linked to DNA-bound proteins including RNA polymerase II 129 and immunoprecipitated with an anti-RNA Polymerase II antibody (arrow 130). Following immunoprecipitation, the cross-links are reversed and the DNA fragments are amplified by LM-PCR (arrow 132). The amplified DNA is labeled with a second label (arrow 134), resulting in second labeled DNA fragments 136. The first labeled DNA fragments 128 and the second labeled DNA fragments 136 are pooled and hybridized to an array 137 including both proviral sequences 138 and genomic sequences 139. In another embodiment (not shown), the first DNA fragments are hybridized to an array that includes only proviral sequences. The second pool of DNA fragments are hybridized to a second array that includes only genomic sequences. In such an embodiment, the DNA fragments can be, but do not have to be, labeled. In yet another embodiment, the first pool of DNA fragments is hybridized to a microarray including both proviral DNA and genomic DNA sequences and an image is obtained. The array is then stripped and then the second pool of DNA fragments is hybridized to the same array. The images obtained from the two hybridizations are compared.",
        "Where the sample is from a host that has a latent retroviral infection, analysis of the array shows the following. The first labeled DNA fragments 128 hybridize to both genomic and proviral sequences on the array. The hybridization of the unenriched fragments 128 to the proviral sequences on the array indicates the presence of proviral DNA in the sample. The second labeled DNA fragments 136, enriched by immunoprecipitation with RNA polymerase II, only hybridize to host genomic sequences, and not to proviral sequences on the microarray. This indicates latent retroviral infection because, although the viral DNA is present, it is not actively transcribed.",
        "In an embodiment, productive retroviral infection is detected in a sample containing genomic DNA according to the method illustrated in FIG. 5.

The second labeled DNA fragments 136, enriched by immunoprecipitation with RNA polymerase II, hybridize to genomic sequences and to proviral sequences on the array. This indicates productive retroviral infection because the viral DNA is being actively transcribed.",
        "In an embodiment, no viral infection is detected in a sample comprising genomic DNA according to the method illustrated in FIG. 6.

        "In another embodiment, the methods are used to detect the integration of proviral DNA into genomic DNA. DNA binding proteins are crosslinked to proviral DNA (if any) and genomic DNA in a cell. In a part of the sample, DNA fragments are enriched by immunoprecipitation with an antibody against integrase. The cross linking is reversed and using LM-PCR, the enriched DNA is amplified and labeled. The other part of the sample, where the DNA has not been enriched by immunoprecipitation, is subjected to LM-PCR and also labeled. Typically, the enriched and unenriched pools of DNA are differentially labeled. Both enriched and unenriched pools of labeled DNA are probed for genomic and proviral DNA. In a further embodiment, both enriched and unenriched pools of labeled DNA are hybridized to a DNA microarray that contains both proviral sequences and genomic sequences, under stringent conditions.",
        "One embodiment of this method is illustrated in FIG. 7 (before integration) and FIG. 8 (after integration). Referring first to FIG. 7, sample DNA 140 contains host genomic DNA 142 and provirus DNA 144. A first portion of the sample DNA is amplified (represented by arrow 146), and labeled with a first label (arrow 148) resulting in first labeled DNA fragments 150. A second portion of the sample DNA is crosslinked to DNA-bound integrase 152 and immunoprecipitated with an anti-RNA integrase antibody (arrow 154). Following immunoprecipitation, the cross-links are reversed and the DNA fragments are amplified (arrow 156). The amplified DNA is labeled with a second label (arrow 158), resulting in second labeled DNA fragments 160. The first labeled DNA fragments 150 and the second labeled DNA fragments 160 are pooled and hybridized to an array 162 providing both proviral complementary sequences 164 and genomic complementary sequences 166.",
        "Hybridization of first labeled DNA fragments 150 to both genomic and proviral sequences confirms presence of retrovirus in the sample. Where analysis of the hybridization to the array shows second labeled DNA fragments 160, enriched by integrase-immunoprecipitation, hybridize only to host genomic sequences on the microarray, and not to proviral sequences, integration has not yet taken place. In addition, array hybridization of integrase-enriched DNA fragments 160 provides an effective method for predicting where an integration event will take place, simply by determining the sequence of the hybridized integrase-enriched fragments 160 and comparing to the genomic sequence.",
        "FIG. 8 illustrates a similar method to FIG. 7, however the retrovirus has already integrated into the host genome. Where integration has already taken place, immunoprecipitation with anti-integrase does not result in any DNA fragments. Presence of the retrovirus is confirmed, as in FIG. 7 by hybridization of the unenriched pool of DNA fragments 150 to both genomic and proviral sequences on the array 162. Once the provirus has been integrated into the genome, the DNA fragments do hybridize to proviral DNA sequences on the array, thereby providing an effective method for determining the location of the integration of a provirus.",
        "In practicing embodiments, various methods may be used to enrich or isolate DNA fragments bound to a protein of interest from a mixture that contains both bound DNA fragments and unbound DNA fragments. A general method for examining protein binding to DNA across a genome was disclosed by Wyrick et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,410,243. In an embodiment, cells are fixed with formaldehyde thereby crosslinking protein bound to DNA to the DNA. The cells are then harvested and sheared by sonication to produce DNA fragments of about 1 kb. The fragments are crosslinked to the protein of interest. Different methods can be used to crosslink DNA binding protein to the host cell genomic DNA or to the proviral DNA. In one embodiment, UV light is used as the crosslinking method. In another embodiment, formaldehyde is used to crosslink DNA binding proteins to the genomic DNA or proviral DNA of the host cell. Formaldehyde crosslinking can be reversed by incubating the crosslinked DNA in a solution with a high salt concentration (such as 5.0M NaCl, for example) at about 65\u00b0 C. for about 4 hours. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) as a technique for determining protein-DNA binding events, is described, for example in Solomon et al., Cell 53: 937-947 (1988). A genome-wide location analysis based on this technique is described by Ren et al., Science 290: 2306-2309 (2000), which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "In an embodiment, the DNA fragments are enriched by immunoprecipitation, using an antibody (either monoclonal or polyclonal), or an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that will specifically bind to the protein of interest. In an embodiment, the DNA fragments are isolated by immunoprecipitation with an anti-RNA polymerase II antibody, which is used to selectively separate DNA fragments bound to RNA polymerase. RNA polymerase II is the enzyme transcribing the integrated HIV proviral genome during a productive viral infection. In another embodiment, the DNA fragments are isolated by immunoprecipitation with an antibody against integrase, which can be used to selectively separate DNA fragments bound to integrase, a protein active in causing integration of the proviral DNA into the host genome. Antibodies against RNA polymerase II and integrase are commercially available.",
        "Isolated DNA fragments can be amplified in a number of different ways including, but not limited to, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Techniques for such amplification are described in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel F. M. et al., eds. 1991, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. In a further embodiment, the DNA fragments are amplified using ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR), which causes reproducible amplification of even very small amounts of DNA.",
        "The isolated and/or amplified DNA fragments from a sample are probed using DNA that is complementary to the sequence of proviral DNA or host cell genomic DNA using one or more of a number of different techniques. In one embodiment, the complementary sequences are immobilized onto a glass slide or microchip to form a DNA microarray. An exemplary array is shown in FIGS. 1-3, where the array shown in this representative embodiment includes a contiguous planar substrate 110 carrying an array 112 disposed on a rear surface 111b of substrate 110. It will be appreciated though, that more than one array (any of which are the same or different) may be present on rear surface 111b, with or without spacing between such arrays. That is, any given substrate may carry one, two, four or more arrays disposed on a front surface of the substrate and depending on the use of the array, any or all of the arrays may be the same or different from one another and each may contain multiple spots or features. The one or more arrays 112 usually cover only a portion of the rear surface 111b, with regions of the rear surface 111b adjacent the opposed sides 113c, 113d and leading end 113a and trailing end 113b of slide 110, not being covered by any array 112. A front surface 111a of the slide 110 does not carry any arrays 112. Each array 112 can be designed for testing against any type of sample, whether a trial sample, reference sample, a combination of them, or a known mixture of biopolymers such as polynucleotides. Substrate 110 may be of any shape.",
        "As mentioned above, array 112 contains multiple spots or features 116 of biopolymers, e.g., in the form of polynucleotides. All of the features 116 may be different, or some or all could be the same. The interfeature areas 117 could be of various sizes and configurations. Each feature carries a predetermined biopolymer such as a predetermined polynucleotide (which includes the possibility of mixtures of polynucleotides). It will be understood that there may be a linker molecule (not shown) of any known types between the rear surface 111b and the first nucleotide.",
        "Substrate 110 may carry on front surface 111a, an identification code, e.g., in the form of bar code (not shown) or the like printed on a substrate in the form of a paper label attached by adhesive or any convenient means. The identification code contains information relating to array 112, where such information may include, but is not limited to, an identification of array 112, i.e., layout information relating to the array(s), etc.",
        "In an embodiment, the isolated DNA fragments are then hybridized to the microarray under stringent assay conditions. Stringent assay conditions as used herein refers to conditions that are compatible to produce binding pairs of nucleic acids, e.g., surface bound and solution phase nucleic acids, of sufficient complementarity to provide for the desired level of specificity in the assay while being less compatible to the formation of binding pairs between binding members of insufficient complementarity to provide for the desired specificity. Stringent assay conditions are the summation or combination (totality) of both hybridization and wash conditions. A stringent hybridization and stringent hybridization wash conditions in the context of nucleic acid hybridization (e.g., as in array, Southern or Northern hybridizations) are sequence dependent, and are different under different experimental parameters.",
        "Stringent hybridization conditions that can be used to identify nucleic acids can include, e.g., hybridization in a buffer comprising 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC, and 1% SDS at 42\u00b0 C., or hybridization in a buffer comprising 5\u00d7SSC and 1% SDS at 65\u00b0 C., both with a wash of 0.2\u00d7SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65\u00b0 C. Exemplary stringent hybridization conditions can also include a hybridization in a buffer of 40% formamide, 1 M NaCl, and 1% SDS at 37\u00b0 C., and a wash in 1\u00d7SSC at 45\u00b0 C. Alternatively, hybridization to filter-bound DNA in 0.5 M NaHPO4, 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mM EDTA at 65\u00b0 C., and washing in 0.1\u00d7SSC/0.1% SDS at 68\u00b0 C. can be employed. Yet additional stringent hybridization conditions include hybridization at 60\u00b0 C. or higher and 3\u00d7SSC (450 mM sodium chloride/45 mM sodium citrate) or incubation at 42\u00b0 C. in a solution containing 30% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 0.5% sodium sarcosine, 50 mM MES, pH 6.5. Those of ordinary skill will readily recognize that alternative but comparable hybridization and wash conditions can be utilized to provide conditions of similar stringency.",
        "In certain embodiments, the stringency of the wash conditions sets forth the conditions that determine whether a nucleic acid is specifically hybridized to a surface bound nucleic acid. Wash conditions used to identify nucleic acids may include, e.g.: a salt concentration of about 0.02 molar at pH 7 and a temperature of at least about 50\u00b0 C. or about 55\u00b0 C. to about 60\u00b0 C.; or, a salt concentration of about 0.15 M NaCl at 72\u00b0 C. for about 15 minutes; or, a salt concentration of about 0.2\u00d7SSC at a temperature of at least about 50\u00b0 C. or about 55\u00b0 C. to about 60\u00b0 C. for about 15 to about 20 minutes; or, the hybridization complex is washed twice with a solution with a salt concentration of about 2\u00d7SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 minutes and then washed twice by 0.1\u00d7SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 68\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes; or, equivalent conditions. Stringent conditions for washing can also be, e.g., 0.2\u00d7SSC/0.1% SDS at 42\u00b0 C.",
        "Stringent assay conditions are hybridization conditions that are at least as stringent as the above representative conditions, where a given set of conditions are considered to be at least as stringent if substantially no additional binding complexes that lack sufficient complementarity to provide for the desired specificity are produced in the given set of conditions as compared to the above specific conditions, where by \u201csubstantially no additional\u201d is meant less than about 5-fold more, typically less than about 3-fold more. Other stringent hybridization conditions are known in the art and may also be employed, as appropriate.",
        "The DNA arrays described herein are arrays of nucleic acids, including oligonucleotides, polynucleotides, DNAs, RNAs, synthetic mimetics thereof, and the like. Specifically, the arrays contain spots or features in the form of oligonucleotides corresponding to specific probe sequences. The subject arrays include at least two distinct nucleic acids that differ by monomeric sequence immobilized on, e.g., covalently to, different and known locations on the substrate surface. In an embodiment, the arrays contain spots corresponding to genomic DNA sequences, as well as proviral DNA sequences. In certain embodiments, each distinct nucleic acid sequence of the array is typically present as a composition of multiple copies of the polymer on the substrate surface, e.g., as a spot on the surface of the substrate. The number of distinct nucleic acid or oligonucleotide sequences, or spots or similar structures present on the array may vary, but is generally at least 2, usually at least 5 and more usually at least 10, where the number of different spots on the array may be as a high as 50, 100, 500, 1000, 10,000 or higher, depending on the intended use of the array. The spots of distinct oligonucleotide sequences present on the array surface are generally present as a pattern, where the pattern may be in the form of organized rows and columns of spots, e.g., a grid of spots, across the substrate surface, a series of curvilinear rows across the substrate surface, e.g., a series of concentric circles or semi-circles of spots, and the like. The density of spots present on the array surface may vary, but will generally be at least about 10 and usually at least about 100 spots/cm2, where the density may be as high as 106 or higher, but will generally not exceed about 105 spots/cm2. In other embodiments, the oligonucleotide sequences are not arranged in the form of distinct spots, but may be positioned on the surface such that there is substantially no space separating one polymer sequence/feature from another.",
        "Arrays can be fabricated using drop deposition from pulsejets of either polynucleotide precursor units (such as monomers) in the case of in situ fabrication, or the previously obtained polynucleotide. In an embodiment, the arrays are fabricated using oligonucleotides with sequences complementary to proviral DNA or host cell genomic DNA. In another embodiment, separate arrays are fabricated, containing either probes for proviral DNA or host cell genomic DNA. Methods for array fabrication are described in detail in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,242,266, 6,232,072, 6,180,351, 6,171,797, 6,323,043, U.S. patent application Ser.
