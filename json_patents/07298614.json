The IBM BladeCenter\u2122 chassis is primarily a server-based blade chassis, where each payload module 106 may include multiple two-way servers for use in an Enterprise environment. In the prior art, the IBM BladeCenter\u2122 chassis does not include adequate support for I/O in the front side 112 because of the position of the blowers (for cooling) and the lack of defined, standards-based cut-outs for I/O interfaces in and around the air filter.

In an embodiment, the mezzanine module may have an I/O interface to allow telephony data to be received by chassis and be processed within the chassis by one or more payload modules 106.

In an embodiment, \u201cU\u201d can measure approximately 1.75 inches. This is not limiting of the invention as payload modules 206 may have any form factor and be within the scope of the invention.
