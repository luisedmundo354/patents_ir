        "Such computers are compact in design for higher portability, so that their standard functions are inevitably more limited than those of desktop computers. Accordingly, such portable computers are generally provided with one or more connectors and ports for function expansion, usually on the rear face of its casing which supports a keyboard and a display unit. These computers are additionally furnished with new functions by connecting peripheral devices, such as a hard disk drive, mouse, printer, etc., to the connectors and ports.",
        "FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate a notebook-type portable computer 1 for use as a portable electronic device which is connected to an external expanding apparatus, commonly referred to as a \u201cdocking station.\u201d The computer 1 includes a plastic casing 2 serving as an apparatus body. The casing 2 is in the form of a flat generally rectangular box having a bottom face 2a and a top face 2b, which extend generally parallel to each other, and a front face 2c, a rear face 2d, and side faces 2e and 2f, which are continuous with the bottom and top faces 2a and 2b. At least one such computer casing 2 further includes a tongue 2g projected from the front face 2c and having a bottom face 2h which may be continuous with the bottom face 2a of the casing 2, a top face 2i which extends generally parallel to the bottom face 2h, and a front face 2j that is spaced away from the casing front face 2c. The tongue 2g may include side surfaces 2k and 2l extending between the computer casing front surface 2c and the tongue front face 2j. Other surfaces of the casing 2, such as one of the side faces 2e, 2f may includes additional features, such as but not limited to a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM 3a and a main power switch 3b.",
        "Arranged on the top face 2b of the casing 2, as illustrated in FIG. 1, is a keyboard 7 which is used to input information and commands. A pair of display supporting portions 8a and 8b, left and right, are formed at the rear end portion of the top face 2b. A flat display unit 9 having a thickness t is connected to the display supporting portions 8a and 8b. The display unit 9 is rotated about a hinge axis h on a pair of legs 10a and 10b, left and right, which are pivotally mounted on the supporting portions 8a and 8b, respectively, by means of hinge devices as is generally well-known. Thus, the display unit 9 is supported on the casing 2 to be rotatable about the hinge axis h relative to the casing 2 between a closed position, in which a display screen surface 9a of the display unit 9 touches the top face 2b of the casing 2. The display unit 9 thereby covers the keyboard 7 for protecting both the keyboard 7 and display screen surface 9a of the display unit 9 with a hard shell backing portion 9b of the display unit 9. The display unit 9 alternately rotates into an open position in which the display unit 9 stands upright with the display screen surface 9a exposed at the back of the keyboard 7, as illustrated. Furthermore, a hard shell lip portion 9c of the display unit 9 surrounds the sensitive display screen 9d, the display screen 9d is slightly recessed below the hard shell lip portion 9c.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates an input/output (I/O) connector or port 4 of the known portable computer being provided in the rear face 2d between interface apertures 4a and 4b on either side thereof. The I/O connector 4 includes a quantity of pins or pin receptors (shown) 4c are organized in a selected pattern. The pins or pin receptors 4c provided input/output (I/O) capability for communicating with various peripheral components that may provide such functions as for example but not limited to: a modem, a game port, audio output, a microphone input, serial connections, parallel connections, a video display output, USB (Universal Serial Bus) connection, a mouse connection, a keyboard connection, an external power supply connection. Alternatively, connection to these or other peripheral devices are provided by a separate and individual modem connector, a game port, audio speaker connectors, a microphone connector, two serial connectors, a parallel connector, a display unit connector, a USB connector, a mouse connector, a keyboard connector, and an external power supply connector, as are generally well-known in the art. A metallic terminal plate 5 is exposed on the rear face 2d and surrounds the I/O connector 4 and includes an open end of each of the apertures 4a and 4b. The apertures 4a and 4b each include a cylindrical aperture or a lengthwise slot (shown) or an aperture of another shape extending from the rear face 2d of the casing 2 toward the opposite front face 2c.",
        "In transporting the computer 1 peripheral devices must be removed from their corresponding connectors or ports, or alternatively the single I/O connector 4. In restoring the computer 1 to its original state after using it elsewhere, any peripheral devices must be connected again via the I/O connector 4. In the case where a large number of peripheral devices are connected, therefore, the removal and connection require very troublesome operations.",
        "To cope with this, there have recently been provided external expanding apparatuses or \u201cdocking stations\u201d which are adapted to be interposed between a portable computer and a plurality of peripheral devices and relay signals transferred between the computer and the devices.",
        "FIG. 3 illustrates one such docking station 13 having a plurality of connectors and ports connectable with the peripheral devices, external power supply connector, etc., and an expansion connector 15 is presented at a connector presentation surface 21 which is opposed to the rear face 2d of the computer casing 2. The expansion connector 15 is structured to engage the computer's I/O connector 4. The expansion connector 15 is mounted on a movable bracket 18 structured to engage apertures 4a and 4b on opposite sides of the I/O connector 4 as a prelude to the expansion connector 15 actually engaging the I/O connector 4. By example and without limitation, the bracket 18 includes a pair of guide pins or arms 18a and 18b that are positioned on opposite sides of the expansion connector 15 to engage apertures 4a and 4b on opposite sides of the I/O connector 4. The expansion connector 15 includes a quantity of pin receptors or pins (shown) 15a organized in a selected pattern to engage the pins or pin receptors 4c of the computer's I/O connector 4. The pins 15a of the expansion connector 15 are connected electrically to different ones of the connectors and ports that are connectable with the peripheral devices.",
        "In known prior art docking station devices 13 the pair of guide pins or arms 18a and 18b positioned on opposite sides of the expansion connector 15 are extended forward of the expansion connector 15 and its pin receptors or pins (shown) 15a such that the guide arms 18a, 18b engage the apertures 4a and 4b on opposite sides of the I/O connector 4 before the expansion connector 15 and its pin receptors or pins 15a the I/O connector 4. Furthermore, the expansion connector 15 is typically loosely mounted on the bracket 18 with a little lateral play such that the expansion connector 15 is permitted to move relative to the bracket 18 and its pin receptors or pins (shown) 15a wiggle or \u201cfloat\u201d into final mating positions with the respective pin receptors (or pins) 4c of the I/O connector 4 after the guide arms 18a, 18b have established a nominal docking position. Thus, the guide arms 18a, 18b with the respective interface apertures 4a, 4b fine tunes the positioning of the pins (or pin receptors) 15a of the expansion connector 15 relative to the pin receptors (or pins) 4c of the computer's I/O connector 4 prior to final insertion.",
        "The docking station 13 also includes a mounting platform 17 on which the computer 1 is removably mounted. The mounting platform 17 is, for example, adjacent connector presentation surface 21, and includes a bearing surface 19 on which the bottom face 2a of the computer casing 2 is placed. The docking station apparatus 13 also includes bullet-nosed engaging pins 23a and 23b, which are provided on the bearing surface 19 adjacent to the connector presentation surface 21. The bottom face 2a of the computer casing 2 includes a pair of locating holes 6a and 6b situated adjacent to the rear face 2d and the side faces 2e and 2f of the casing 2. The locating holes 6a, 6b each include a cylindrical aperture extending from the bottom face 2a toward the opposite top face 2b and sized to accept the bullet-nosed engaging pins 23a, 23b on the bearing surface 19 of the docking station 13. The locating holes 6a and 6b thus serve to locate the computer's I/O connector 4 relative to the expansion connector 15 on the presentation surface 21 of the docking station 13.",
        "In connecting the computer to the docking station 13, the tongue 2g of the computer casing 2 is fit into a mouth 25 of a mating receiver structure 27 adjacent to the bearing surface 19 opposite from and facing toward the connector presentation surface 21. The computer casing 2 is rotated about the tongue 2g with the bottom surface 2a of the casing 2 guided toward the bearing surface 19. When the bottom surface 2a of the casing 2 is close to the bearing surface 19, the mating locating holes 6a and 6b in the bottom surface 2a of the casing 2 engage the locating pins 23a, 23b of the docking station 13, which positions the casing 2 relative to the docking station 13, and in particular positions the I/O connector 4 relative to the docking station's expansion connector 15.",
        "Thereafter, the docking station's expansion connector 15 and the pair of guide pins or arms 18a, 18b on either side of the expansion connector 15 are moved together in the direction indicated by the arrow toward the rear face 2d of the computer 1 in a manner such that the pair of guide pins or arms 18a, 18b are fitted individually in the recesses of the respective interface apertures 4a, 4b by operation of a swingable operating lever 29. Such engagement of the guide arms 18a, 18b with the respective interface apertures 4a, 4b fine tunes the positioning of the pins (or pin receptors) 15a of the expansion connector 15 relative to the pin receptors (or pins) 4c of the computer's I/O connector 4. Continued operation of the operating lever 29 continues movement of the expansion connector 15 toward the computer's I/O connector 4, and engages the pins (or pin receptors) 15a with the pin receptors (or pins) 4c during final insertion.",
        "As a result, the expansion connector 15 of the docking station 13 is connected to the computer's I/O connector 4. Additionally, the computer 1 cannot be removed from the docking station 13 because the guide pins or arms 18a, 18b engaging the interface apertures 4a, 4b conspire with the receiver structure 27 engaging the computer casing's tongue 2g, and the locating pins 23a and 23b engaging the mating locating holes 6a and 6b in the bottom surface 2a of the computer casing 2 to secure the computer 1 relative to the docking station's connector presentation surface 21 and the bearing surface 19, respectively.",
        "In removing the computer from the docking station apparatus 13, the operating lever 29 is reversed to move the expansion connector 15 away from the computer rear surface 2d, whereby the expansion connector 15 is disconnected from the computer's I/O connector 4, and the guide pins or arms 18a, 18b are disengaged from the respective interface apertures 4a, 4b. The computer casing 2 can be rotated about the tongue 2g so that the bottom surface 2a of the casing 2 is disengaged from the bearing surface 19, and the computer 1 is disengaged from the docking station 13.",
        "In the docking station apparatus 13 described above, the pins (or pin receptors) 15a of the expansion connector 15 are attached to a circuit board which is located within a casing 31 of the apparatus 13, and the expansion connector 15 is connected to the circuit board through a flexible wiring harness. The flexible wiring board is in turn connected through other flexible wiring harnesses to separate and individual modem connector, a game port, audio speaker connectors, a microphone connector, two serial connectors, a parallel connector, a display unit connector, a USB connector, a mouse connector, a keyboard connector, and an external power supply connector, as are generally well-known in the art.",
        "FIG. 4 illustrates an input/output (I/O) plate 33 of the docking station 13 where the flexible wiring harnesses of external devices may be connected to, for example, a mouse connector 35, a keyboard connector 37, a display unit connector 39, one or more serial connectors 41, a game port 43, a parallel connector 45, a serial connector 47, one or more USB connectors 49, a microphone connector 51, one or more speaker connectors 53, an external power supply connector 55, a modem connector 57, or a power switch 59.",

        "FIG. 5 is a front perspective view that illustrates the present invention embodied by example and without limitation as a novel external computer expanding apparatus or \u201cdocking station\u201d 100 which is adapted to be interposed between a portable computer of the type illustrated in FIGS. 1-3 and a plurality of peripheral devices and relay signals transferred between the computer and the devices.",
        "The docking station 100 includes a two-piece body 102 having an upper body portion 102a connected to a lower body portion 102b along a line 103 of mutual contact. The upper body portion 102a is formed with a bearing surface 104 on one face of a substantially rigid bearing plate 105. The bearing surface 104 is structured for the computer casing 2 to be removably placed thereon. A connector presentation surface 106 is projected above the bearing surface 104 for presenting an expansion connector 108 to the rear face 2d of the computer 1 when the computer's bottom face 2a is placed on the bearing surface 104. The upper body portion 102a also includes means for securing the computer 1 to the bearing surface 104 in fixed position relative to the connector presentation surface 106 such that a coupling with the expansion connector 108 is not interrupted unintentionally. By example and without limitation, the securing means includes a receiver structure 110 fixedly positioned adjacent to a front portion 111 of the bearing surface 104 opposite from the connector presentation surface 106 and having an open jaw structure 112 facing toward the connector presentation surface 106 and structured to receive and mate with the tongue 2g on the front face of the computer casing 2. Mating of the tongue 2g within the open jaw 112 of the receiver structure 110 resists separation of the computer casing's bottom face 2a from the bearing surface 104. Such mating of the tongue 2g within the jaw 112 of the receiver structure 110 also resists sliding of the computer casing 2 along the bearing surface 104 away from the connector presentation surface 106. Additionally, the open jaw 112 may optionally include lips on either side thereof that engage side surfaces 2k and 2l (if present) of the tongue 2g, and by such engagement, resist sideways slippage along the bearing surface 104 parallel of the connector presentation surface 106.",
        "The securing means also includes a pair of engaging pins 114a and 114b fixedly positioned on a rear portion 115 of the bearing surface 104 adjacent to the connector presentation surface 106, the engaging pins 114a, 114b are structured to be slidingly received into the mating locating holes 6a and 6b in the bottom surface 2a of the casing 2. The two engaging pins 114a and 114b operate to position the computer casing 2 relative to the docking station bearing surface 104, and in particular to position the computer's I/O connector 4 relative to the docking station's expansion connector 108. Such mating of the two engaging pins 114a, 114b within the respective locating holes 6a, 6b also serve to resist both lateral and longitudinal slippage of the computer casing 2 relative to the bearing surface 104. The two engaging pins 114a, 114b resist both sliding of the computer casing 2 along the bearing surface 104 away from the connector presentation surface 106, and simultaneously resist sideways slippage along the bearing surface 104 parallel of the connector presentation surface 106.",
        "The securing means also includes a pair of guides 116a and 116b provided as either substantially rigid pins or stiff arms that are positioned on opposite sides of the expansion connector 108. The guides 116a and 116b extend past the expansion connector 108 and engage the apertures 4a and 4b on opposite sides of the computer's I/O connector 4 in advance of the expansion connector 108 engaging the computer's I/O connector 4. As is discussed in detail below, by operation of a sliding expansion connector drive mechanism 118, the expansion connector 108 simultaneously with the pair of guide pins or arms 116a, 116b (hereinafter \u201cguide arms\u201d) on either side of the expansion connector 108 are together moved inward from the presentation surface 106 (in the direction indicated by arrow 120) across the bearing surface 104 toward the opposing open jaw 112 of the receiver structure 110 in a manner such that the pair of guide arms 116a, 116b are fitted individually in the recesses of the respective interface apertures 4a, 4b the rear face 2d of the computer casing 2 in advance of connection of the connector 108 with the computer's I/O connector 4. Such engagement of the guide arms 116a, 116b with the respective interface apertures 4a, 4b presses the pair of guide arms 116a, 116b against the respective interface apertures 4a, 4b in the rear face 2d of the computer casing 2, which in turn pushes the front face 2c toward the receiver structure 110 and the tongue 2g into its open jaw 112. Additionally, the mating of the guide arms 116a, 116b within the respective computer casing interface apertures 4a, 4b resist sideways slippage along the bearing surface 104 parallel of the connector presentation surface 106. More importantly, the mating of the guide arms 116a, 116b within the respective computer casing interface apertures 4a, 4b resists separation of the computer casing's bottom face 2a from the bearing surface 104 so that the two engaging pins 114a, 114b within the respective locating holes 6a, 6b more effectively resist both lateral and longitudinal slippage of the computer casing 2 relative to the bearing surface 104.",
        "Furthermore, the expansion connector 108 includes a quantity of pin receptors or pins (shown) 122 organized in a selected pattern to engage the pins or pin receptors 4c of the computer's I/O connector 4. Accordingly, such engagement of the guide arms 116a, 116b on either side of the expansion connector 108 with the respective interface apertures 4a, 4b also fine tunes the positioning of pin receptors or pins (shown) 122 of the expansion connector 108 relative to the pin receptors (or pins) 4c of the computer's I/O connector 4, whereby operation of the expansion connector drive 118 causes the expansion connector 108 to engage the computer's I/O connector 4, and engages the pins (or pin receptors) 122 with the pin receptors (or pins) 4c.",
        "Thus, the three-part computer securing means includes the receiver structure 110 fixed adjacent the front portion 111 of the bearing surface 104, the engaging pins 114a and 114b fixed on the rear face 115 of the bearing surface 104, and the guide arms 116a, 116b on either side of the expansion connector 108, which operate together to retain the computer's I/O connector 4 on the rear face 2d of the casing 2 in uninterrupted engagement with the docking station's expansion connector 108.",
        "However, the guide arms 116a, 116b on either side of the expansion connector 108 might interfere with seating the computer casing 2 against the bearing surface 104, so a sensing means 123 is optionally provided for sensing that the computer's casing 2 is emplaced on the docking station's bearing surface 104 with its I/O connector 4 positioned to receive the docking station's expansion connector 108. For example, the optional sensing means 123 may be provided in the form of safety catch 124 having a stem or button that cooperates with the expansion connector drive 118 to detect presence of the computer 1 against the bearing surface 104. As discussed herein below, if present, the sensing means 123 is an optional safety mechanism that prevents the expansion connector drive 118 from being operated unless the computer casing 2 is firmly seated against the bearing surface 104 of the docking station upper body portion 102a, which depresses the safety catch 124. Thus, the docking station 100 optionally senses the presence of the computer 1 when installation of the casing 2 causes depression of the safety catch 124, if present. By requiring previous operation of the safety catch 124, if present, the expansion connector 108 cannot be deployed until the computer's I/O connector 4 is positioned to receive it. Accordingly, neither the guide arms 116a, 116b nor the expansion connector 108 can interfere with seating the computer casing 2.",
        "Furthermore, while the computer casing 2 is being seated, the expansion connector 108 remains tucked safely away in a home position on the sidelines of the bearing surface 104. For example, the expansion connector 108 is protected in a disengaged \u201csafe\u201d position within an integral housing portion 126 of the casing upper body 102a positioned at the rear 115 of the bearing surface 104, where the expansion connector 108 is out of harm's way during seating of the computer casing 2. By example and without limitation, the housing 126 extends above the bearing surface 104 and is formed with a cavity 128 that is extended rearward of the bearing surface 104. The cavity 128 is sized to hold the expansion connector 108 on a connector bracket 130 having guide arms 116a, 116b projected therefrom on either side of the expansion connector 108. The bracket 130, together with the expansion connector 108 and guide arms 116a, 116b on either side thereof, is movable (as indicated by arrow 120) by operation of the expansion connector drive mechanism 118 out of the cavity 128 and inward of the bearing surface 104 through an opening 132 formed in the presentation surface 106 of the housing 126.",
        "The docking station 100 of the present invention optionally includes a locking latch mechanism 134 for constraining the expansion connector drive mechanism 118 relative to the upper body portion 102a of the docking station 100. Accordingly, the locking latch mechanism 134 constrains the bracket 130 having the expansion connector 108 and guide arms 116a, 116b in a deployed position, the deployed position having the expansion connector 108 outside the cavity 128 and extended over the bearing surface 104.",
        "As a result, the expansion connector 108 of the docking station 100 is connected to the computer's I/O connector 4. Additionally, the computer 1 cannot be removed from engagement with the docking station 100 because the guide arms 116a, 116b engaging the interface apertures 4a, 4b cooperate with the receiver structure 110 engaging the computer casing's tongue 2g, and the locating pins 114a and 114b engaging the mating locating holes 6a and 6b in the bottom surface 2a of the computer casing 2 to secure the computer 1 relative to the connector presentation surface 106 and the bearing surface 104, respectively, of the docking station apparatus 100. The locking latch mechanism 134 ensures the expansion connector drive mechanism 118 cannot be dislodged so that the guide arms 116a, 116b continue to engage the interface apertures 4a, 4b, even if the expansion connector drive mechanism 118 is attempted to be dislodged, either accidentally or intentionally.",
        "In removing the computer from the docking station apparatus 100 of the invention, the expansion connector drive mechanism 118 is reversed to move the expansion connector 108 away from the computer rear surface 2d, whereby the expansion connector 108 is disconnected from the computer's I/O connector 4, and the guide arms 116a, 116b are disengaged from the respective interface apertures 4a, 4b. The computer casing 2 can be rotated about the tongue 2g so that the bottom surface 2a of the casing 2 is disengaged from the bearing surface 104, and the computer 1 is disengaged from the docking station 100.",
        "According to one embodiment of the docking station 100 of the invention, the expansion connector 108 is optionally loosely mounted on the bracket 130 with a little lateral play such that the expansion connector 108 is permitted to move relative to the bracket 130 and its pin receptors or pins (shown) 122 wiggle or \u201cfloat\u201d into final mating positions with the respective pin receptors (or pins) 4c of the I/O connector 4 after the guide arms 116a, 116b have established a nominal docking position, as in the prior art. Thus, the guide arms 116a, 116b with the respective interface apertures 4a, 4b fine tunes the positioning of the pins (or pin receptors) 122 of the expansion connector 108 relative to the pin receptors (or pins) 4c of the computer's I/O connector 4 prior to final insertion.",
        "Alternatively, the expansion connector 108 is optionally securely mounted on the bracket 130 without appreciable lateral play such that the expansion connector 108 is not permitted to move relative to the bracket 130 and its pin receptors or pins (shown) 15a do not wiggle or float into final mating positions with the respective pin receptors (or pins) 4c of the I/O connector 4. Rather, as discussed herein below, the expansion connector drive mechanism 118 provides sufficient lateral play that, the guide arms 18a, 18b operate to establish both a nominal docking position and a final insertion position of the expansion connector 108 relative to the computer's I/O connector 4. Thus, the complexity of the prior art bracket 18, as discussed herein above, is eliminated, while the positioning function is maintained as a feature of the expansion connector drive mechanism 118 of the invention.",
        "Optionally, hand clearances 137 communicate with either side of the docking station's computer bearing surface 104 for access to the bottom surface 2a of the computer 1 for lifting it free of the bearing surface 104 and the guide pins 114a, 114b projected therefrom. By example and without limitation, the hand clearances 137 are provided as indentations in the upper body portion 102a and optionally in the lower body portion 102b as well. The hand clearances 137 are located near the connector presentation surface 106 and the guide pins 114a, 114b for more easily lifting the computer 1 clear of the guide pins 114a, 114b and the jaw 112 of the receiver structure 110 opposite.",
        "Additionally, an edge recess 139 communicates with the docking station's computer bearing surface 104 and one side of the upper body portion 102a for storing a novel display unit support 142 that is structured for supporting the computer's flat display unit 9.",
        "Additionally, as discussed herein below and more clearly illustrated in subsequent figures, the docking station's expansion connector 108 is electrically coupled to a plurality of peripheral device connectors 136a, 136b through 136n provided by example and without limitation on a peripheral device connector presentation surface 138 of the lower body portion 102b. For example, the lower body portion 102b includes an integral rear housing 140 having the presentation surface 138 provided thereon.",

A recessed throat portion 146 of the receiver structure's jaw 112 is set back between the front portion 111 of the bearing surface 104 and the upper lip 144. The recessed throat portion 146 of the jaw 112 engages the front face 2c of the computer casing 2.",
        "Here also are illustrated a plurality of edge mounting holes 148 formed along the mutual contact line 103 which also operates as a separation line between the upper and lower body portions 102a, 102b of the docking station's two-piece body 102. As discussed herein below, the edge mounting holes 148 each provide novel means for holding a square- or hex-head screw with its threaded shaft extending out of the respective mounting hole 148 substantially parallel with the bearing surface 104 and perpendicular to respective side faces 152 and 154 of the upper and lower body portions 102a, 102b.

By example and without limitation the expansion connector drive mechanism 118 is formed of a single-piece elongated frame 204 having a substantially planar interface surface 233 (shown in one or more subsequent figures). A follower mechanism 206 is provided by example and without limitation as an elongated lengthwise inner slot that extends substantially along a longitudinal axis L thereof for nearly the entire length of the frame 204 within a retention plate 207. An integral expanded connector seat 208 is positioned at a first distal or far end 210 of the frame 204 for mounting the expansion connector 108 thereon.",
        "An inner surface 224 of the upper body portion's substantially rigid bearing plate 105 opposite from the bearing surface 104 includes a guide mechanism 226 that cooperates with the inner slot 206 to guide the frame 204 substantially along a drive axis DA that is substantially coincident with a longitudinal axis L of the slot 206. The inner slot follower mechanism 206 of the frame 204 thus cooperates with the guide mechanism 226 for moving the frame 204 across the inner surface 224 of the upper body portion 102a along the drive axis DA with the frame's substantially planar interface surface 233 moving substantially parallel with the inner surface 224 of the bearing plate 105. Here, the interior of the guide mechanism 226 is exposed for clarity. By example and without limitation, the guide mechanism 226 is formed by two guides 228 arranged on the upper body portion's inner surface 224 in spaced apart positions along the drive axis DA. Optionally, the guides 228 are rotating disk guides formed as wheels or rollers that rotate about respective axles or hubs 232 provided on the upper body portion's inner surface 224. The axles or hubs 232 may be configured to space the rotating disk guides 228 slightly away from the upper body portion's inner surface 224 for easier rotation. By example and without limitation, the two guides 228 are optionally provided as one or more slides fixed to the inner surface 224 of the upper body portion 102a and permit the frame 204 to slide freely along the drive axis DA. As described herein below, the frame 204 is constrained relative to the guides 228 to move across the upper body portion's inner surface 224 along the drive axis DA.",
        "When mounted on the connector seat 208 at the far end 210 of the frame 204, the expansion connector 108 fits within the cavity portion 128 of the housing 126 and extends above the bearing surface 104 of the upper body portion 102a. The frame 204 is moveable, either by sliding or rolling, in cooperation with the guide mechanism 226 across the inner surface 224 of the upper body portion 102a and along the drive axis DA.",
        "The expansion connector drive mechanism 118 of the invention also provides a small amount of lateral play (indicated by arrow 241) such that the connector seat 208 is permitted to move laterally relative to the upper body portion's inner surface 224 and the bearing surface 104 on the opposite surface of the bearing plate 105 and substantially crosswise of the drive axis DA. For example, the follower mechanism or slot 206 fits with sufficient play on the guides 228 that the frame 204 is permitted sufficient lateral play along arrow 241 that lateral play the connector seat 208 permits the expansion connector 108 securely mounted thereon to move laterally relative to the bearing surface 104 of the upper body portion's bearing plate 105. Thus, although is securely mounted on the bracket 130 without appreciable lateral play, the connector seat 208 actually has sufficient lateral play through the expansion connector drive mechanism 118 of the invention to establish both a nominal docking position of the expansion connector 108 relative to the computer's I/O connector 4 and a final insertion position of the pin receptors or pins (shown) 122 relative to the I/O connector's pin receptors (or pins) 4c. Thus, the complexity of the prior art bracket 18, as discussed herein above, is eliminated, while the positioning function is maintained as a feature of the expansion connector drive mechanism 118 of the invention.",

No. 11/064,777 filed in the name of the inventor of the present invention on Feb. 23, 2005, which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Alternatively, when present, the optional locking mechanism 134 lockingly secures the expansion connector 108 in the deployed position.",
        "The sensing means 123 is provided as a security mechanism 220 that is structured to cooperate with the safety catch 124 to resist deployment of the expansion connector 108 until the computer 1 is seated against the bearing surface 104 and the computer's I/O connector 4 is positioned to receive the expansion connector 108. By example and without limitation, the security mechanism 220 is provided in an integral security plate 221 formed, by example and without limitation, along the side 218 of the frame 204 and spaced away from the lengthwise inner slot 206, for example, between the connector seat 208 and the handle 214. The security mechanism 220 is provided as a keyhole 222 formed in the security plate 221, the keyhole 222 being structured for cooperating with the safety catch 124 such that, when the safety catch 124 is engaged with the keyhole 222, the frame 204 cannot be moved relative to the casing's upper body portion 102a. Furthermore, when the safety catch 124 is disengaged from the cooperating keyhole 222 in the security plate 221, the frame 204 is free to move along the longitudinal axis L.",
        "The novel expansion connector drive mechanism 118 is operated by first depressing the safety catch 124 relative to the bearing surface 104 of the upper body portion 102a, for example by seating the bottom face 2a of the computer casing 2 against the bearing surface 104. Depressing the safety catch 124 simultaneously disengages the safety catch 124 of the security mechanism 220 from the cooperating keyhole portion 222 in the security plate 221, which thereby permits the frame 204 to move along the frame drive axis DA. The handle 214 of the expansion connector drive mechanism 118 is pulled along the drive axis DA toward the front face 172 of the casing's upper body portion 102a, which in turn pulls the expansion connector 108 and the guide arms 116a, 116b on either side thereof into the deployed position described herein, i.e., with the expansion connector 108 outside the cavity 128 and extended over the bearing surface 104. The lip portion 242 of the frame's integral catch mechanism 212 engages either the optional lock mechanism 134, or alternative non-locking latch mechanism 244 (shown here), which constrains the expansion connector drive mechanism 118 in the deployed position.",
        "An optional retraction mechanism 246 is operated for retracting the expansion connector 108 from the deployed position by driving the frame 204 along the drive axis DA away from the upper body portion's front face 172 toward its rear face 248. By example and without limitation, the retraction mechanism 246 includes a resilient biasing mechanism 250, such as a tension spring (shown), that is coupled between the rear face 248 of the upper body portion 102a and the second or near end 216 of the frame 204 adjacent to the handle 214. The biasing mechanism 250 operates between the rear face 248 and the near end 216 of the frame 204 for pulling the frame 204 toward the rear face 248. The biasing mechanism 250 thereby operates to automatically retract the expansion connector 108 from the deployed position when the locking latch mechanism 134 or non-locking latch mechanism 244 (shown here) is operated to release the frame's integral catch mechanism 212. Alternatively, as illustrated, the spring 250 is coupled between a stanchion 251 near the rear face 248 and the near end 216 of the frame 204 for retracting the expansion connector 108.",
        "Furthermore, the resilient biasing mechanism or tension spring 250 being mounted on one side 218 of the frame 204 offset of the drive axis DA provides leverage to the force applied by the spring 250. Therefore, the spring 250 also biases the frame 204 on the guides 228 relative to the upper body portion's inner surface 224 crosswise of the drive axis DA. Accordingly, the spring 250 also pulls the inner slot 206 of the frame 204 against the guides 228 so that the connector seat 208 and the expansion connector 108 securely mounted thereon are biased laterally relative to the upper body portion's inner surface 224 and the bearing surface 104 on the opposite surface of the bearing plate 105 and substantially crosswise of the drive axis DA. The lateral bias provided by the offset biasing mechanism 250 stabilizes the expansion connector 108 relative to the computer's I/O connector 4 for reducing effects on the interconnection of shocks and vibrations experienced by the docking station 100. The novel expansion connector drive mechanism 118 of the invention thus further improves the interconnection of expansion connector 108 with the computer's I/O connector 4 over the prior art docking station's expansion connector 15, as discussed above.",
        "As disclosed herein, the safety catch 124 will not interfere with the retraction mechanism 246 retracting the frame 204. However, another biasing mechanism 252 (shown in subsequent figures) operates to reset the sensing means for sensing that the computer's casing 2 is emplaced on the docking station's bearing surface 104 before the expansion connector drive 118 can be operated.",

No. 11/064,777, which is incorporated herein in its entirety, for latching the expansion connector 108 in the deployed position. As illustrated here by example and without limitation the alternative non-locking latch mechanism 244 includes a tooth 254 positioned at one end of a flexible arm 256 that is integrally (shown) or separately attached at its opposite end to the upper body portion 102a, such as to the front face 172 thereof. Inclined surfaces 257 and 258 cooperate to allow the to tooth 254 to automatically engage the lip portion 242 of the frame's integral catch mechanism 212 when the frame 204 is moved into the position for deploying the expansion connector 108, i.e., when the near end 216 of the frame 204 is pulled close to the front face 172 of the upper body portion 102a. A handle 260 is provided on the flexible arm 256 or another part of the alternative non-locking latch mechanism 244 for disengaging the tooth 254 from the frame's lip portion 242, which releases the frame 204 for retracting the expansion connector 108 from the deployed position.",

Here, by example and without limitation one or more keepers 240 are secured to the upper body portion's inner surface 224 by one or more fasteners 236 for constraining the frame 204 to move along the drive axis DA. The one or more keepers 240 also operate to constrain the guide discs 228, when present, in a position for cooperating with the inner slot 206 of the frame 204. Other structures for the guide mechanism 226 are also contemplated and may be substituted without deviating from the scope and intent of the present invention. For example, the one or more keepers 240 are provided by a pair of disk-shaped keepers, i.e., flat washers, that are secured to the upper body portion's inner surface 224 by the fasteners 236 for constraining the frame 204 to move along the drive axis DA.",

Here, the biasing mechanism 250 is shown as being in an expanded state for pulling the frame 204 toward the rear face 248 when the security mechanism 220 is subsequently disengaged. The biasing mechanism 250 thereupon operates to retract the expansion connector 108 from the deployed position when the optional lock mechanism 134 is operated to release the frame's integral catch mechanism 212.",

Furthermore, the expansion connector 108 and guide pins or arms 116a, 116b are likewise cannot be moved out of the cavity 128 to interfere with seating the computer 1. For example, a stem portion 272 of the safety catch 124 projects above the bearing surface 104 where the computer 1 is to be seated. The stem 272 is sized to pass through both a narrow elongated slot portion 274 at a distal end of the keyhole 222, and a clearance passage 276 through the bearing surface 104. Furthermore, the stem portion 272 is cooperatively sized with the narrow slot portion 274 to slide freely along a substantial length thereof, which thus permits the frame 204 to move between the fully retracted position (shown here) and the fully deployed position (shown in subsequent figures). The stem portion 272 of the safety catch 124 extends from a base portion 278 having a shoulder 280 that is oversized relative to the passage 276 so that the upper body portion's inner surface 224 on the backside of the bearing surface 104 operates as a stop for the safety catch 124. Furthermore, the base portion 278 of the safety catch 124 is too large to pass through the narrow slot portion 274 of the keyhole 222. However, the keyhole 222 includes an enlarged passage 282 that communicates with a near end 284 of the slot portion 274 and is sized to pass the base portion 278 of the safety catch 124.

By example and without limitation, when the biasing mechanism 252 is a conventional compression spring, as illustrated here, the base portion 278 of the safety catch 124 is structured with a cavity or pocket 286 that is sized to admit a first end portion 288 of the spring 252 and orient the spring 252 along a drive axis DS of the safety catch 124 that is by example and without limitation oriented substantially perpendicular to the bearing surface 104 of the upper body portion 102a. A second end portion 290 of the spring 252 is compressed against the inner surface 253 of the lower body portion 102b (omitted here for clarity). Accordingly, the spring 252 operates against the inner surface 253 of the lower body portion 102b to drive the safety catch 124 through the security plate 221 and the passage 276 to project from the bearing surface 104. Thus, the docking station's computer sensing means 123 is set and the expansion connector 108 is secure against being inadvertently deployed.",

Simultaneously, the safety catch's base portion 278, which is oversized relative to the narrow slot portion 274 of the keyhole 222, is pushed through the keyhole 222 and completely out of the security plate 221. Only the stem portion 272 of the safety catch 124 now extends through the narrow slot portion 274 of the keyhole 222.

        "As discussed herein, when the bottom face 2a of the casing 2 is seated against the docking station's bearing surface 104, as shown in previous figures, the compression spring of the biasing mechanism 252 is compressed against the inner surface 253 of the lower body portion 102b. By example and without limitation, a cavity or pocket 292 is provided on the inner surface 253 of the lower body portion 102b, the pocket 292 being sized to admit the second end portion 290 of the spring 252 opposite from the pocket 286 in the safety catch base portion 278, and being structured to cooperate with the pocket 286 in the safety catch base portion 278 for orienting the spring 252 along the drive axis DS of the safety catch 124. The spring 252 is thus compressed between the two pockets 286 and 292 for driving the safety catch 124 through the security plate 221 and the passage 276 to project from the bearing surface 104. Thus, the spring 252 operates to set the docking station's computer sensing means 123 for securing the expansion connector 108 against inadvertent deployment.",
        "FIG. 26 and FIG. 27 are respective top and bottom perspective views that together illustrate one embodiment of the frame 204 portion of the expansion connector drive 118 of the invention. Here, the single-piece elongated frame 204 is illustrated having the elongated lengthwise inner slot 206 extending nearly the entire length thereof substantially along the longitudinal axis L thereof. The integral expanded connector seat 208 is positioned at the first distal or far end 210 for mounting the expansion connector 108 thereon, and includes a pattern of several mounting holes 294 for attaching the expansion connector 108. The integral catch mechanism 212 and integral handle 214 portions are both positioned adjacent to the second proximal or near end 216 of the frame 204 opposite from the connector seat 208. The handle 214 may be provided, by example and without limitation, on one side 218 of the frame 204, while the catch mechanism 212 may be provided, by example and without limitation, at the near end 216. As discussed herein, the catch mechanism 212 includes the lip portion 242 that is structured to cooperate with either the locking latch mechanism 134 or alternative non-locking latch mechanism 244 for securely fixing the expansion connector drive mechanism 118 relative to the upper body portion 102a of the docking station 100 with the expansion connector 108 in a deployed position. As illustrated here by example and without limitation the lip portion 242 is integrally formed with the inclined surface 258 that cooperates with the inclined surface 257 of the latch mechanism's tooth 254 for helping the to tooth 254 to automatically engage the lip portion 242 when the frame 204 is moved into the position for deploying the expansion connector 108.",
        "The inclined surface 258 of the lip portion 242 similarly cooperates with the inclined surface 266 of the retractable tooth 262 of the optional lock mechanism 134, when present. The inclined surface 258 similarly helps the to tooth 262 to automatically engage the lip portion 242 when the frame 204 is moved into the position for deploying the expansion connector 108.",
        "The security mechanism 220 is structured to cooperate with the safety catch 124 to resist deployment of the expansion connector 108 until the computer 1 is seated against the bearing surface 104. Accordingly, the frame 204 includes the integral security plate 221 formed along the side 218 thereof and spaced away from the lengthwise inner slot 206 between the connector seat 208 and the handle 214. The keyhole 222 is formed in the security plate 221 with the narrow slot portion 274 formed substantially parallel with the longitudinal axis L and having the enlarged passage 282 communicating with the proximal or near end 284 thereof.",
        "The second proximal or near end 216 of the frame 204 includes means for coupling the resilient biasing mechanism 250 for retracting the expansion connector 108 from the deployed position along the drive axis DA. By example and without limitation, the second proximal or near end 216 of the frame 204 includes a simple clearance hole 298 for coupling the biasing mechanism 250, i.e., spring 252, between it and the rear face 248 of the upper body portion 102a, as shown in FIG. 16. The resilient biasing mechanism 250 thus operates between the upper body portion's rear face 248 and the near end 216 of the frame 204 for retracting the expansion connector drive 118 from the deployed position when the locking latch mechanism 134 or alternative non-locking latch mechanism 244 is operated to release the frame's integral catch mechanism 212.",
        "FIG. 28 is perspective view inside the upper body portion 102a and illustrates the expansion connector drive mechanism 118 of the present invention having a simplified single-piece elongated frame 304 having an elongated lengthwise inner slot 306 extending nearly the entire length of the frame 304 substantially along a longitudinal axis LA thereof. An integral expanded connector seat 308 is positioned at a first distal or far end 310 of the frame 304 for mounting the expansion connector 108 thereon. An integral catch mechanism 312 and integral handle portion 314 are both positioned adjacent to a second proximal or near end 316 of the frame 304 opposite from the connector seat 308. The handle 314 may be provided, by example and without limitation, on an arm 317 extended from one side 318 of the frame 304, while the catch mechanism 312 may be provided, by example and without limitation, at the near end 316. The catch mechanism 312 is structured to cooperate with either the locking latch mechanism 134 or alternative non-locking latch mechanism 244 for constraining the expansion connector 108 to remain in the deployed position, as described herein.",
        "The lengthwise slot 306 in the alternate frame 304 cooperates with the guide mechanism 226 on the inner surface 224 of the upper body portion 102a opposite from the bearing surface 104 for guiding the frame 304 substantially along the drive axis DA, as described herein. By example and without limitation, lengthwise slot 306 cooperates with the two guides 228 of the guide mechanism 226 that are arranged on the upper body portion's inner surface 224 in spaced apart positions along the drive axis DA. By example and without limitation, the two guides 228 are optionally provided as one or more slides that permit the frame 304 to slide freely along the drive axis DA. Alternatively, the guides 228 are optionally formed as wheels or rollers that rotate about respective axles or hubs 232 provided on the upper body portion's inner surface 224. The axles or hubs 232 may be configured to space the guides 228 slightly away from the upper body portion's inner surface 224 for easier rotation. The frame 304 is constrained to move relative to the upper body portion's inner surface 224 along the drive axis DA by one or more keepers 240 (shown in phantom). For example, a pair of disc-shaped keepers 240 are secured to the upper body portion's inner surface 224 by one or more fasteners 236 for constraining the frame 304 to move along the drive axis DA. The one or more keepers 240 also operate to constrain the guide wheels 228, when present, in a position for cooperating with the inner slot 306 of the frame 304. Other structures for the guide mechanism 226 are also contemplated and may be substituted without deviating from the scope and intent of the present invention.",
        "The alternate frame 304 is structured such that, when the expansion connector 108 is mounted on the connector seat 308 at the far end 310 of the frame 304, it fits within the cavity portion 128 of the housing 126 and extends above the bearing surface 104 of the upper body portion 102a. The alternate frame 304 is moveable, either by sliding or rolling, in cooperation with the guide mechanism 226 across the inner surface 224 of the upper body portion 102a and along the drive axis DA.",
        "A security mechanism 320 is structured to cooperate with the safety catch 124 to resist deployment of the expansion connector 108 until the computer 1 is seated against the bearing surface 104 and the computer's I/O connector 4 is positioned to receive the expansion connector 108. Similar to the security mechanism 220 of the frame 204 discussed herein, by example and without limitation, the security mechanism 320 of the alternate frame 304 is provided in an integral security plate 321 formed, by example and without limitation, along the side 318 of the frame 304 and spaced away from the lengthwise inner slot 306, for example, between the connector seat 308 and the handle 314. The security mechanism 320 is provided as a keyhole 322 formed in the security plate 321, the keyhole 322 being structured for cooperating with the safety catch 124 such that, when the safety catch 124 is engaged with the keyhole 322, the frame 304 cannot be moved relative to the casing's upper body portion 102a. For example, the keyhole 322 includes at a distal end thereof a narrow slot portion 324 sized to freely move the stem portion 272 of the safety catch 124 along a substantial length thereof so that the frame 304 is permitted to move between the fully retracted position (shown here) and the fully deployed position (shown in previous figures). The keyhole 322 also includes an enlarged passage 326 that communicates with a near end 328 of the slot portion 324 and is sized to pass the base portion 278 of the safety catch 124 for disarming the safety catch 124.",
        "Similar to the novel expansion connector drive mechanism 118 operated with the frame 204, here the novel expansion connector drive mechanism 118 of the invention is operated by first depressing the safety catch 124 relative to the bearing surface 104 of the upper body portion 102a, for example by seating the bottom face 2a of the computer casing 2 against the bearing surface 104. Depressing the safety catch 124 simultaneously disengages the safety catch 124 of the security mechanism 320 from the cooperating keyhole portion 322 in the security plate 321, which thereby permits the frame 304 to move along the frame drive axis DA. The handle 314 of the expansion connector drive mechanism 118 is pulled parallel to the drive axis DA toward the front face 172 of the casing's upper body portion 102a, which in turn pulls the expansion connector 108 and guide arms 116a, 116b on either side thereof into the deployed position described herein, i.e., the expansion connector 108 outside the cavity 128 and extended over the bearing surface 104. A integral lip portion 330 of the frame's integral catch mechanism 312 engages either the locking latch mechanism 134 (shown) or the alternative non-locking latch mechanism 244 provided on the upper body portion 102a. The locking latch mechanism 134 (shown) or alternative non-locking latch mechanism 244 constrains the expansion connector 108 to remain in the deployed position, as described herein. As illustrated, the a retractable tooth 262 of the lock mechanism 134 automatically engages the lip 330 when the alternate frame 304 is moved into the position for deploying the expansion connector 108 as discussed herein. For example, an inclined lead surface 332 on the frame's lip portion 330 cooperates with the lead surface 258 to automatically engage the tooth 262 of the lock mechanism 134 when the alternate frame 304 is moved into the position for deploying the expansion connector 108.",
        "The retraction mechanism 246 automatically retracts the expansion connector 108 from the deployed position by pulling the frame 304 along the drive axis DA away from the upper body portion's front face 172 toward its rear face 248. By example and without limitation, the biasing mechanism 250, such as a tension spring (shown), is coupled between the rear face 248 and a simple catchment 334 at the second or near end 316 of the frame 304 adjacent to the handle 314. The biasing mechanism 250 operates between the rear face 248 the catchment 334 for retracting the frame 304 toward the rear face 248. The biasing mechanism 250 thereby operates to retract the expansion connector 108 from the deployed position when the locking latch mechanism 134 (shown) or alternative non-locking latch mechanism 244 is operated to release the frame's integral catch mechanism 312.",
        "Alternatively, a compression spring 335 is substituted for the compression spring as the biasing mechanism 250 of the retraction mechanism 246 for automatically retracting the expansion connector 108 from the deployed position. The compression spring 335 operates by pushing the frame 304 along the drive axis DA away from the upper body portion's front face 172 toward its rear face 248.",
        "As disclosed herein, the safety catch 124 will not interfere with retraction of the alternate frame 304. However, the biasing mechanism 252 operates to reset the sensing means for sensing that the computer's casing 2 is emplaced on the docking station's bearing surface 104 before the expansion connector drive 118 can be operated.",
        "FIG. 29 is an upside-down close-up view showing the edge mounting holes 148 formed along the mutual contact line 103 between the upper and lower body portions 102a, 102b of the docking station's two-piece body 102. As discussed herein, the edge mounting holes 148 each provide novel means for holding for example but not limited to a square- or hex-shaped mechanical nut N with its threaded bore aligned with the respective mounting hole 148 substantially parallel with the bearing surface 104 and perpendicular to respective side faces 152 and 154 of the upper and lower body portions 102a, 102b. Any external device can be threadedly attached to the body 102 by means of the shaft S of a screw or bolt B being inserted into a selected one of the edge mounting holes 148 and threaded into the bore of the nut N.",
        "The edge mounting holes 148 are formed by a pair of mating shapes 336 and 338 formed in the docking station's two-piece body 102 through the mating upper and lower body portions 102a, 102b. The shapes 336, 338 meet along the mutual contact line 103. By example and without limitation, the edge mounting holes 148 are formed by a pair of mating semi-circular holes 336 and 338 formed in the docking station's two-piece body 102 through the mating upper and lower body portions 102a, 102b along the mutual contact line 103. However, the mating holes 336, 338 may alternatively be different in shape from semi-circular, for example, the holes 336, 338 may be mating rectangular shapes that form a square hole when mated, or semi-hexagonal shapes that form a hexagonal shape when mated, or another combination of shapes that form an aperture adjacent to the mating line 103 of the upper and lower body portions 102a, 102b, and such shapes may be substituted for the semi-circular shapes illustrated without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Furthermore, the entire shape of the resultant edge mounting holes 148 may be alternatively formed in the edge of either one of the upper and lower body portions 102a, 102b without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, as illustrated by the edge mounting hole 148 at the far left of the figure, the edge mounting holes 148 may alternatively be formed as a generally \u201cU\u201d or \u201cV\u201d or square-shaped hole 336 entirely within an edge portion 340 of one of the side faces 154 of the lower body portion 102b, or the front 172 or rear face 248, while the mating hole is entirely eliminated from the upper body portion 102a, and the shape 338 is an edge portion 342 of an opposite face 154, 174 or 248 of the upper body portion 102a that is exposed by the hole 336 in the lower body portion 102b, whereby the edge mounting hole 148 is formed by the shaped hole 336 that is closed by the mating shape 338 of the upper body portion's exposed edge portion 342. Alternatively, as illustrated by the edge mounting hole 148 at the center of the figure, the edge mounting holes 148 may alternatively be formed as a generally \u201cU\u201d or \u201cV\u201d or square-shaped hole 338 entirely within the edge portion 342 of the upper body portion 102a, while the mating hole 336 is entirely eliminated from the lower body portion 102b, and the shape 336 is the edge portion 340 of the lower body portion 102b that is exposed by the hole 338 in the upper body portion 102a, whereby the edge mounting hole 148 is formed by the shaped hole 338 that is closed by the mating shape 336 of the lower body portion's exposed edge portion 340.",
        "Each of the edge mounting holes 148 is backed by a respective nut pocket 346 formed by an open well 348. As illustrated by the cross-sectional view of the edge mounting hole 148 and corresponding nut pocket 346, the well 348 of the integral nut pocket 346 is formed in one of the upper body portion 102a or the lower body portion 102b (shown). The well 348 is generally rectangular in cross-section and extends through the bottom plane 156 of the lower body portion 102b past the contact line 103. The well 348 is formed having an opening 350 formed in the bottom plane 156 of the lower body portion 102b (shown) or adjacent to the bearing surface 104 in the upper body portion 102a. The nut pocket's well 348 and opening 350 thereto are sized to admit a nut N of a desired size, such as #2, #4, #6, #8, #10, \u00bc inch, or metric size nut or bolt head H. For example, the well 348 is formed by a pair of spaced apart rigid side walls 352 and 354 that extend inwardly of the side face 154 of the lower body portion 102b and downwardly of the bottom plane 156 and substantially perpendicular to each. The side walls 352, 354 are sufficiently spaced to easily admit the nut N of the desired size without being significantly oversized such that the nut N cannot rotate in the well 348. The side walls 352, 354 may include a slight draft angle from the opening 350 toward the contact line 103. The mating shapes 336, 338 along the contact line 103 are correspondingly sized to admit the shaft of the bolt B sized to mate with the nut N.",
        "FIG. 30 illustrates that an extension portion 356 of each well 348 extends past the contact line 103. The extension portion 356 closes the end of the corresponding well 348.

Additionally, the bottom walls 358, 360 may optionally form an included angle 363 therebetween centered about the corner 362, the included angle 363 being constructed to mate with the angled walls of the nut N of the desired size and shape, i.e., square or hex. For example, the included angle 363 between the bottom walls 358, 360 is structured to mate with the nut N such as a square or hex nut (shown), whereby the nut N is constrained from turning when torque is applied during insertion and tightening of the screw or bolt B. For example, the angle 363 formed by the bottom walls 358, 360 is about 90 degrees to accommodate a square nut. Alternatively, the angle 363 is about 120 degrees to accommodate a hex nut.",

As illustrated (center and right) the nut pockets 346 are optionally fully formed in the selected upper body portion 102a or lower body portion 102b (shown). Alternatively, as illustrated by the nut pocket 340 (far left) the extension portion 356 is optionally formed in the opposing body portion 102a (shown) and positioned to align with the walls 352, 354 of the well 348.",

The backing panel 364 is a means for constraining the nut N from backing away from the edge hole 148 when the screw or bolt B is applied thereto.",
        "Also illustrated here is the simplicity of operation of the nut pockets 346. Here, the nut pocket 346 is operated by simply dropping the nut N of the appropriate size through the opening 350 into the well 348 corresponding to the selected edge mounting hole 148 with two of the nut's parallel sides S1 and S2 oriented substantially parallel with the well's side walls 352, 354, as illustrated. Thereafter, the nut N falls into the extension portion 356 at the end of the well 348 and nests between the side walls 352, 354 and the bottom walls 358, 360 of the extension 356 that combine to form the bottom of the well 348. Upon the nut N nesting in the extension portion 356 of the well 348, the nut's threaded bore Nb substantially automatically self-aligns with the edge mounting hole 148. Thereafter, the screw or bolt B of the appropriate size is inserted through the corresponding hole 148 and threaded into the nut's bore Nb for attaching a desired edge attachment.",

According to one optional embodiment of the display unit support 142, the shoulder portion 402 of the support arm 388 rotates about a pivot axle 404 (shown in one or more subsequent figures) that is aligned along the pivot axis 392 and extends between a hub portion 400 of the body 102 and the arm's shoulder portion 402. Alternative embodiments of the pivot mechanism 398 may be substituted without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.",
        "The support arm 388 is constrained to operate about the pivot mechanism 398 with the shoulder portion 402 abutting the body's hub portion 400 by the pivot mechanism 398. By example and without limitation, the axle 404 is optionally a screw or bolt passed through one of the edge mounting holes 148 of the type described herein and threaded into a nut 406 (shown in one or more subsequent figures) in one of the nut pockets 346 of the type described herein. Thereafter, a knob or handle 408 on the axle 404 is operated for tightening and loosening of the shoulder portion 402 of the support arm 388 vis-\u00e0-vis the hub portion 400 of the body 102 by turning relative to the nut 406 in the nut pocket 346 of the body 102. Thus, the handle 408 on the head portion 410 of the axle 404 operates against an outside face 412 of the shoulder portion 402 of the support arm 388 to compress the shoulder portion 402 against the body's hub 400. Accordingly, friction between the shoulder portion 402 and the hub 400 caused by tightening of the handle 408 on the head portion 410 of the axle 404 constrains the support arm 388 to remain in a selected rotational orientation with the upper body portion's bearing surface 104. The display unit support 142 thus constrains the computer's flat display unit 9 in the selected rotational orientation. The rotational orientation of the support arm 388 of the display unit support 142 with the upper body portion's bearing surface 104 is thus infinitely adjustable by alternately loosening and tightening the handle 408.",
        "The novel display unit support 142 of the invention also includes a novel display unit clamping mechanism 414 adjacent to a second extreme support end portion 416 of the rigid support arm 388 opposite from the first pivot end portion 390. By example and without limitation, the display unit clamping mechanism 414 adjacent to the second support end portion 416 of the support arm 388 is structured as a spring-loaded vice for constraining the display unit 9 relative to the support end portion 416 of the support arm 388. Accordingly, the display unit 9 is pinched between an integral substantially rigid anvil 418 and a separate and rotatable substantially rigid jaw 420. By example and without limitation, the clamping mechanism 414 includes the substantially rigid anvil 418 being integral with the elongated support arm 388. The supporting anvil 418 is extended laterally to a longitudinal axis 422 of the support arm 388 to an extent 423 that at least an end portion 424 of the anvil 418 distal from the support arm 388 is projected into space in a position opposite from a portion of the bearing surface 104 in the vicinity of either one of the pair of fixedly positioned engaging pins 114a and 114b (shown) and spaced away from the computer bearing surface 104 by several inches. The anvil 418 is formed with an arcuate support surface 426 that is curved in a convex shape covering an extended arc having a substantially smooth face aligned generally with the longitudinal axis 422 of the elongated support arm 388 and facing toward the front face 172 of the body 102a such that the hard shell backing portion 9b of the display unit 9 is supported in an upright position relative to the keyboard 7 on the top face 2b of the computer casing 2 by resting against the arcuate support surface 426 of the anvil 418, as illustrated herein.",
        "The separate substantially rigid jaw 420 includes a first proximate barrel-shaped knuckle portion 428 that is projected inward of a substantially rigid finger 430. The knuckle portion 428 of the jaw 420 is coupled to the anvil 418 adjacent to a heal portion 432 thereof proximate to the end portion 416 of the support arm 388. The knuckle portion 428 spaces the rigid finger 430 away from the arcuate support surface 426 of the anvil 418 by a variable short distance 434 that is adjustably configured to permit the flat display unit 9 of the computer 1 to fit therebetween. The short distance 434 by which the finger 430 is spaced away from the arcuate support surface 426 of the anvil 418 is adjustable to accept therebetween different thicknesses t of flat display units 9 of different computers 1 (illustrated in FIG. 1). The short distance 434 is also variable as discussed herein to permit the flat display units 9 to rotate to different orientations with the keyboard 7 on the top face 2b of the computer casing 2, while remaining constrained against the arcuate support surface 426 of the anvil 418 by the jaw 420.",
        "Furthermore, an integral hard nub or button 436 (more clearly shown in one or more subsequent figures) is optionally projected slightly from an inward facing surface 438 of the rigid finger 430 adjacent to a second end 440 thereof distal from the first proximate knuckle portion 428 thereof. The jaw 420 is thus positioned in a pinching relationship to the anvil 418 such as to capture the display unit 9 between the arcuate support surface 426 of the anvil 418 and the nub 436 projected from the distal end 440 of the rigid finger 430. Thus, the display screen surface portion 9a of the display unit 9 is supported in an upright position relative to the keyboard 7 on the top face 2b of the computer casing 2 by the rigid jaw 420, as illustrated herein. Accordingly, the display unit 9 of the computer 1 is constrained from falling backward away from the keyboard 7 by the anvil 418, and is simultaneously constrained from falling forward toward the keyboard 7 by the jaw 420.",
        "The display unit clamping mechanism 414 also includes a variable pressure resilient biasing mechanism 442 (detailed in a subsequent figure) that resiliently biases the jaw 420 toward the arcuate support surface 426 of the anvil 418 in the pinching relationship described herein. By example and without limitation, the biasing mechanism 442 automatically varies the spacing distance 434 to accommodate the varying cross-sectional thickness of the display unit 9 of the computer 1 of the prior art as the display unit 9 is rotated relative to the top face 2b of the computer casing 2 about its hinge axis h into different upright positions at the back of the keyboard 7.",

The edge recess 139 is sized such that the anvil 418 is nested below the bearing surface 104 so as not to interfere with seating of the computer 1. The knob 408 may be tightened to secure the support arm 388 in the stored position.",

        "Furthermore, as illustrated here, the second end 440 of the rigid finger 430 extends sufficiently from the jaw 420 that the button 436 on the inward facing surface 438 thereof is extended over the hard shell lip portion 9c of the display unit 9 onto the display screen 9d. The rigid finger 430 thus wraps around the hard shell lip portion 9c of the display unit 9, and the button 436 thus falls below the lip portion 9c onto the display screen 9d.

Simultaneously therewith the rigid jaw 420 constrains the display unit 9 to follow rotations of the support arm 388 about the pivot axis 392.

The threaded end 450 of the screw or bolt type pivot axle 404 is threaded into the nut 406 installed in one of the nut pockets 346 of the type described herein, wherein the nut 406 is optionally a lock nut of the hex variety.

The biasing mechanism 442 thus permits the clamping mechanism 414 to accommodate the varying cross-sectional thickness t of the display unit 9 as it is rotated into different orientations relative to the keyboard 7 on the top face 2b of the computer casing 2. As the display unit 9 rotates from the substantially vertical upright position illustrated in FIG. 47, the cross-sectional thickness t increases, and the display unit 9 exerts pressure on the biasing mechanism 442, which spreads the jaw portion 420 of the clamping mechanism 414 resiliently away from the anvil portion 418. However, the spring 490 exerts an opposite compression pressure that squeezes the rigid finger 430 of the jaw 420 against the display screen surface 9a so that the display unit 9 is pressed against the arcuate support surface 426 of the anvil 418. Similarly, when the display unit 9 is rotated from any non-vertical position, such as the extreme over-center position illustrated in FIG. 49, the spring 490 continues to exert the compression pressure that squeezes the rigid finger 430 of the jaw 420 against the display screen surface 9a so that the display unit 9 is pressed against the arcuate support surface 426 of the anvil 418 even while the cross-sectional thickness t decreases.",
        "Furthermore, as illustrated here, the second end 440 of the rigid finger 430 extends sufficiently from the jaw 420 that the button 436 on the inward facing surface 438 thereof is extended over the hard shell lip portion 9c of the display unit 9 onto the display screen 9d. As discussed elsewhere herein, the rigid finger 430 thus wraps around the hard shell lip portion 9c of the display unit 9. The biasing mechanism 442 operating along the longitudinal drive axis 444 forces the button 436 below the lip portion 9c and against the display screen 9d. Accordingly, the biasing mechanism 442 operates the button 436 to constrain the novel display unit clamping mechanism 414 from slipping laterally off of the lip portion 9c and inadvertently releasing the display unit 9.",
        "FIG. 55 illustrates by example and without limitation the novel display unit clamping mechanism 414 of the display unit support 142 invention in a passive configuration wherein the hard shell backing portion 9b of the display unit 9 is supported by the anvil 418 portion of the support arm 388 with the opposing jaw portion 420 in an open position relative to the display screen surface 9a. Accordingly, the jaw 420 including the finger portion 430 is rotated away from the active position over the display screen surface 9a. For example, the knuckle 428 is pulled away from the anvil 418 along the longitudinal drive axis 444 until the detent 530 disengages, i.e., until the teeth 532 slide free of the slots 534. The jaw portion 420 is rotated until the finger 430 clears the display unit 9. With the finger 430 in this passive configuration, the jaw 420 is freed and the compression spring 490 draws the knuckle 428 toward the anvil 418 along the longitudinal drive axis 444. The teeth 532 and slots 534 may be additionally configured to form the detent 530 between the between the guide pin portion 500 and the knuckle portion 428 for securing the jaw 420 in the passive configuration vis-\u00e0-vis the anvil 418.",
        "Alternative embodiments of the display unit clamping mechanism 414 and biasing mechanism 442 may be substituted without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.",
        "While the preferred and additional alternative embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the inventor makes the following claims."
