    "abstract": "Methods, algorithms, database structures, and reports for informing consumers of changes in times and channels at which episodes of a television (TV) series are aired on television each week. Based on prior TV listings, an expected time-channel (i.e., day-of-week, time, and channel) for airing a TV series is derived. Actual time-channels for a given week are compared with the expected time-channels to determine whether a deviation from the expected time-channel has occurred. If the deviation has occurred, then the deviation is classified, stored in a database, and transferred to a report that shows a list of such deviations for various TV series.",

        "A consumer of television (TV) programming may be interested in a particular series of TV programs. For example, the consumer may have previously sampled at least one individual series episode, or the consumer may have an interest in the type of content that the series itself purports to deliver. Such previous sampling interest by the consumer creates an expectation of content for other, yet-to-be-seen episodes in the same series, and allows the consumer to ensure his or her enjoyment of TV viewing time by seeking to view such series episodes. Traditionally, consumers set aside, on a weekly basis, periods of viewing time around the consistent recurrence of a series episode at a particular time of the week. Now that significantly more channels are available to the consumer, consistent schedules for series episodes, especially on commercial broadcast networks in the U.S., have become less stable as these broadcast networks alter the standard airing times as part of an overall attempt to achieve larger audiences, especially among targeted demographic groups. As a result, a series episode that is aired in a given week may be aired at a normally expected time, at another time, or not at all.",

The relevant database structures of the present invention include an Airings Database Structure, a Series Scheduling Expectation (SSE) Database Structure, and a Deviation Database Structure. In the context of the present invention, a database structure comprises a structure that stores data in an organized format such as, inter alia, a relational database, a non-relational database, a spreadsheet, a table, a file, etc.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates an Airings Database Structure, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The Airings Database Structure is represented in FIG. 1 in tabular form and shows the scheduling of three TV series denoted as \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, and \u201cD\u201d over a four-week period. The Airings Database Structure has four columns respectively titled as \u201cChannel-Week\u201d, \u201cDay of Week\u201d, \u201cStart Time\u201d, and \u201cSeriesEpisode\u201d. Each row represents a scheduled airing of a TV program, wherein the TV program is an episode of a series. The Series-Episode column identifies the series and episode of the TV program. For example, B2 identifies a TV program comprising the 2nd episode of the series B. The Channel-Week column includes a channel identifier and a week identifier. The channel identifier identifies the channel on which the episode is scheduled to be aired. The week identifier identifies the week (chronologically) during which the episode is scheduled to be aired. For example, \u201cCH2-W4\u201d denotes that the episode is scheduled to be aired on channel 2 during week 4. The channel identifier comprises any manner of identifying a channel such as, inter alia, an integer, call letters (e.g., WXYZ), etc. The week identifier is comprises any manner of identifying a week, such as, inter alia, an integer, a date denoting the first day of the week, etc. The Day of Week comprises any manner of identifying a day, such as, inter alia, an integer, a usual day identifier (e.g., Monday), etc. The Start Time is a time at which the TV program starts. As an example, the row comprising \u201cCH1-W3, Thursday, 9:00 pm, B4\u201d denotes that an episode 4 of TV series B is scheduled for airing on channel 1 during week 3 on Thursday starting at 9:00 pm.",
        "The Airings Database Structure is a source of information about TV series scheduling, and a Series Scheduling Expectation (SSE) Database Structure may be derived from the Airings Database. A SSE Database Structure comprises expected scheduling information for each TV series. Such scheduling information is called a \u201ctime-channel\u201d comprising a day-of-week, start time, and channel (e.g., Monday, 8:00 pm, CH1 in FIG. 1). Accordingly, a SSE Database Structure includes an expected time-channel for each series.",
        "FIG. 2 depicts a SSE Database Structure derived from the Airings Database Structure of FIG. 1, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The SSE Database Structure of FIG. 2 shows an expected time-channel (alternatively called expectation time-channel) for each of series A, B, C, and D. For example, the SSE Database Structure of FIG. 2 shows that the expected time-channel for series A is [Monday, 8:00 pm, CH1], which means that an episode of series A is expected to be aired on Monday at 8:00 pm on channel 1. Each row or record of FIG. 2 comprises a \u201cseries time-channel identifier\u201d (STI), wherein the STI includes a series identifier (e.g., A) and an associated expected time-channel (e.g., [Monday, 8:00 pm, CH1]).",
        "Note that each series identifier (i.e., A, B, C, D) appears no more than once in the SSE Database Structure of FIG. 2. An alternative SSE Database Structure comprise STIs which are divided into groups, wherein each group includes a subset of the STIs, and wherein each series identifier appears no more than once within each group. For example, the alternative SSE Database Structure could comprise a first group and a second group, wherein the first group has series identifiers A, B, C, D, and wherein the second group has series identifiers B, C, E, F.",
        "The next issue concerns how the SSE database Structure of FIG. 2 was derived from the from the Airings Database Structure of FIG. 1. If the SSE Database Structure of FIG. 2 was derived looking backward in time (e.g., looking backward from week 5), then FIG. 1 shows that the series A was consistently aired on [Monday, 8:00 pm, CH1] in the most recent past (i.e., week 4) as well on two earlier weeks, namely weeks 1 and 2. Additionally, while series A was not aired during week 3, series A was never aired at any time-channel that differs from Monday, 8:00 pm, CHI. Hence, the time-channel of [Monday, 8:00 pm, CH1] is the only possible choice, based on FIG. 1, for insertion in the SSE Database Structure of FIG. 2.",
        "The series B includes three time-channels in FIG. 1, namely: a first time-channel [Tuesday, 8:00 pm, CH1] in weeks 1, 2, and 4; a second time-channel [Wednesday, 9:00 pm, CH1] in week 2; and a third time-channel [Thursday, 9:00 pm, CH1] in week 3. However, the first time-channel is a preferred choice for the expected time-channel, because the first time-channel was \u201crelevant\u201d for series B in the most recent past (i.e., during week 4) and was also \u201crelevant\u201d during weeks 1 and 2. A given time-channel relating to a series is said to be \u201crelevant\u201d during a given week if the series has aired or is scheduled to be aired during the given week in accordance with the given time-channel (i.e., at the time-of-day and start time, and on the channel, of the given time-channel). In contrast, the second time-channel was relevant only during week 2, and the third time-channel was relevant only during week 3. If the first time-channel has been chosen in FIG. 2 as the expected time-channel for series B, then the second and third time-channels of series B may each be viewed as a \u201cdeviation\u201d from the expected time-channel (i.e., the first time-channel) of series B. Such deviations keyed to a week. Thus the second time-channel defined a deviation for week 2, while the third time-channel defined a deviation for week 3. Indeed, once an expected time-channel has been identified for a TV series, all other time-channels that are relevant for airing an episode of the series in any given week are viewed as \u201cdeviations\u201d for the given week relative to the expected time-channel for the series. Whenever a deviation time-channel appears in a TV schedule or has aired, it is proper to say that a deviation has occurred. Generally, a deviation has occurred in a given week if: 1) during the given week the series has aired at a time-channel that differs from the expected time-channel, or 2) during the given week the series has not aired at all (i.e., a \u201cSeries Preemption\u201d). The second time-channel for series B typifies a deviation for week 2 called a \u201cSeries Expansion\u201d because both the expected time-channel and the second time-channel are relevant in week 2. The third time-channel for series B typifies a deviation for week 3 called a \u201cSeries Move,\u201d because the third time-channel, and not the expected time-channel, is relevant in week 3.",
        "The series C includes five time-channels in FIG. 1, namely: a first time-channel [Friday, 10:00 pm, CH2] in weeks 1, 2, and 4; a second time-channel [Friday, 10:00 pm, CH3] in week 3; a third time-channel [Saturday, 12:00 pm, CH2] in week 4; a fourth time-channel [Saturday, 1:00 pm, CH2] in week 4, and a fifth time-channel [Saturday, 2:00 pm, CH2] in week 4. As with the series A and B, a good choice for the expected time-channel of series C is the first time-channel, because the first time-channel was relevant in the most recent past (i.e., in week 4) and the first time-channel was consistently relevant (i.e., in weeks 1, 2, and 4). The second time-channel for series C typifies a \u201cSeries Move\u201d type of deviation for week 3, because the second time-channel, and not the expected time-channel, is relevant in week 3. Note that the deviation (i.e., Series Move) of the second time-channel for series C relates to a channel change. In contrast, the deviation (i.e., Series Move) of the second time-channel for series B, discussed supra, relates to a time-of-day and start time change. Generally, two time-channels are said to differ if any of time- of-day, start time, or channel differs between the two time-channels. The third, fourth, and fifth time-channels of the series C collectively represent a deviation known as a \u201cSeries Marathon\u201d because they are scheduled in \u201ccontiguous\u201d time slots on Saturday of week 4. Note that the word \u201ccontiguous\u201d is intended to mean \u201cconsecutive\u201d herein.",
        "The series D includes one time-channel in FIG. 1, namely [Wednesday, 7:00 pm, CH3]. This time-channel of series D is an expected time-channel of series D, because this time-channel of series D is the only time-channel of series D in Table 1. In this example, there are no deviations for the series D.",
        "The SSE Database Structure of FIG. 2 is based on weeks 1-4 of the Airings Database Structure of FIG. 1. The deviations discussed herein relative to the SSE Database Structure of FIG. 2 considered deviations for series A, B, C, and D for each of weeks 1-4. Such deviations are summarized in a Deviation Database Structure in FIG. 3. A Deviation Database Structure generally comprises at least one deviation record for a given week. Each such deviation record relates to a program of a TV series such that during the given week the program is on a time-channel that deviates from an expected time-channel for the TV series. Each deviation record includes a Deviation Type (e.g., \u201cSeries Expansion\u201d in FIG. 3), an identifier of the series (e.g., the \u201cB\u201d portion of \u201cB3\u201d in the SeriesEpisode column of FIG. 3), and the time-channel on which the program is scheduled to be aired (see Day-of-Week, Start Time, and Channel-Week columns of FIG. 3). Each deviation record also includes an identifier of the program (e.g., \u201cB3\u201d in the SeriesEpisode column of FIG. 3) unless there is no relevant program such as with the deviation of Series Preemption.",
        "Once an SSE Database Structure is specified, however, deviations may be derived for any desired week. Indeed, it is beneficial to derive series deviations for a subsequent week (i.e., a week forward in time relative to the weeks in the SSE Database Structure), in order to inform a TV consumer of such deviations when knowledge of such deviations would be useful to the consumer; i.e., at a time when the consumer needs to be informed of such deviations for those series that the consumer regularly watches on TV. To illustrate, FIG. 4 depicts a SSE Database Structure based on weeks 1-3 of the Airings Database Structure of FIG. 1. Note that series D does not appear in FIG. 4, because series D is not aired during weeks 1-3. The series D is aired for the first time during week 4, as shown in the Airings Database Structure of FIG. 1.",
        "FIG. 5 depicts a Deviation Database Structure which summarizes series deviations for week 4 in relation to weeks 1-3 in the SSE Database Structure of FIG. 4. Note that series D appears in the Deviation Database Structure of FIG. 5 as a deviation called a \u201cSeries Initiation\u201d (SI), because series D was aired for the first time during week 4 and thus has no expectation of being aired during week 4 based on the SSE Database Structure of FIG. 4. The appearance of series D in the Deviation Database Structure of FIG. 5 and the absence of series D in the Deviation Database Structure of FIG. 3 illustrates that deviations have relevance only with respect to a SSE Database Structure.",
        "As discussed supra, the types of deviations that may occur comprise: Series Preemption (SP), Series Move (SM), Series Marathon (MA), Series Expansion (SE), and Series Initiation (SI). A Series Preemption (SP) occurs in a given week for a series that has previously aired, but is not aired during the given week. From FIG. 1, a preemption for series A has occurred in week 3, because the series A is not aired during week 3, but has aired in a previous week (i.e., in week 1, week 2). A Series Move (SM) occurs in a given week for a series if the expected time-channel for the series exists but is not relevant for the given week and another time-channel for the series is relevant for the given week. A Series Marathon (MA) occurs in a given week for a series if the expected time-channel for the series is relevant for the given week and the series is relevant during the given week for at least 3 contiguous time-channels that do not include the expected time-channel. A Series Expansion (SE) occurs in a given week for a series if the expected time-channel for the series is relevant for the given week and another time-channel is relevant for the given week, provided that a Series Marathon has not occurred for the given week. A Series Initiation (SI) occurs in a given week for a series that is scheduled to be aired during the given week and the series has not aired prior to the given week.",
        "FIGS. 1-5, discussed supra, provided examples of how a SSE Database Structure with expected time-channels may be generated from an Airings Database Structure, and how series deviations may be derived for a TV series in a given week based on a given SSE Database Structure. However, FIGS. 1-5 are merely illustrative. Indeed, the present invention discloses generalized methods, algorithms, and database structures for determining expected time-channels for a given TV series, and for determining series deviations for a given week based on given expected time channels such as exists in a SSE Database Structure. Such generalized methods of the present invention are illustrated in FIGS. 6-9.",
        "FIG. 6 is a flow chart 10 describing a method or algorithm for determining an expected time-channel for a television (TV) series, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The following discussion, although expressed in terms of the method of FIG. 6, applies likewise to an algorithm that implements the method of FIG. 6. The method of FIG. 6 begins with step 12, which identifies a given TV series, a reference week and a reference time-channel associated with the reference week. In some applications, the reference week is the latest week in the recent past for which TV scheduling information is known for the given TV series.",
        "As an example using FIG. 1 with series A as the given TV series, week 4 is chosen as the reference week and the reference time-channel is [Monday, 8:00 pm, CH1].",
        "If the reference week has plurality of time-channels, then one time-channel of the plurality of time-channels must be chosen as the reference time-channel for purposes of implementing the method of FIG. 6 for determining the expected time-channel. Of course, the method of FIG. 6 may be repeatedly applied taking in turn each time-channel in the reference week as the reference time-channel, and one of the resultant expected time-channels may be selected as the best expected time-channel.",
        "The method of FIG. 6 makes the expected time-channel equal to the reference time-channel unless some condition is satisfied, wherein the condition reasonably dictates that the expected time-channel should be made equal to an alternative time-channel. Accordingly, step 14 of FIG. 6 comprises specifying the condition. This approach recognizes that the reference week is likely to be the most recent week for which scheduling data is available. Thus, the expected time-channel should be the same as the reference time-channel unless the condition dictates otherwise. Step 16 tests whether the condition has been satisfied. In performing the test of step 16, the method may utilize program time-channel data relating to programs of the TV series, wherein the program time-channel data is stored in an Airings Database Structure, such as the Airings Database Structure of FIG. 1 that was used for determining the expected time-channels in the SSE Database Structures of FIGS. 2 and 4. If the condition has not been satisfied, then in step 20 the method makes the expected time-channel equal to the reference time-channel. If the condition has been satisfied, then in step 22 the method makes the expected time-channel equal to the alternate time-channel. Step 24 stores the expected time-channel in a SSE Database Structure.",
        "Examples of conditions are shown in FIG. 7, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. A first example condition in FIG. 7 is an overriding expected time-channel, such as may be based on human expertise derived from exposure to various external information inputs such as advertising, public relations information and programming contacts to provide an alternate time-channel that is a better choice of expectation time-channel than is the reference time channel.",
        "A second example condition in FIG. 7 is based on looking N weeks (N\u22672) backward in time from the reference week and testing to determines if another time-channel (called an alternate time-channel) has aired during the N weeks. An example of another time-channel for series B in FIG. 1 is [Thursday, 9:00 pm, CH1] which aired in week 3. Then the condition is based on balancing the frequency of airing of the reference time-channel against the frequency of airing the alternate time-channel, during the 10 weeks. It stands to reason that the expected time-channel should be the reference time-channel, rather than the alternate time-channel, unless the alternate time-channel has aired frequently and the alternate time-channel has aired infrequently during the N weeks. Mathematically, the condition is structured as follows:",
        "1) the TV series has aired on the reference time-channel no more than K weeks of N weeks preceding the reference week; and",
        "2) the TV series has aired on an alternate time-channel during M weeks of the N weeks,",
        "wherein:",
        "N is an integer of at least 2,",
        "K is an integer that is no less than 0, and",
        "M is an integer of at least 2 and greater than 0.50N truncated.",
        "Note that a number X \u201ctruncated\u201d (e.g., 0.50N truncated) means that if X has an integer portion and a decimal portion, then the decimal portion is dropped. Thus 3.21 truncated is 3, and 5.0 truncated is 5. Values of N, K, and M are application-dependent and may be viewed as, inter alia, user input. Alternatively, values of N, K, and M may be encoded within an algorithm that implements the method of FIG. 6.",
        "The method (or associated algorithm) of FIGS. 6-7 is called the ETCRA method (or ETCRA algorithm). ETCRA stands for Expected Time-Channel from Reference or Alternate Time-Channel.",
        "FIG. 8 presents a table of examples of applicable combinations of N, K, and M which are based on the idea that the condition should be satisfied only if M is a large percentage of N and if K is a small percentage of N. The values in FIG. 8 may be abstracted to the following formulas showing K and M each as a function of N:\n\nN=2, K=0, and M=2;\n\n3\u2266N\u22666, K=0, and M=N\u22121;\n\n7\u2266N\u22669, K=1, and M=N\u22122; and\n\nN\u226710, K=0.10N truncated, and M=0.90N truncated.\n\nThe combinations of N, K, and M shown in FIG. 8 are merely illustrative and any combination of N, K, and M satisfying the defining conditions on N, K, and M (i.e., N\u22672, 0\u2266K\u2266N, 2\u2266M\u2266N, and M>0.50N truncated) are within the scope of the present invention. Additionally, although it may be desirable for the N weeks to be consecutive and to immediately precede the reference week, it is within the scope of the present invention for the N weeks to not be consecutive and/or to not immediately precede the reference week.",
        "FIG. 9 is a flow chart describing a method or algorithm for Deviation Determination for Television (DDTV), in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. For a TV series in a given week, deviation determination determines whether a deviation has occurred for the TV series, and the type of deviation that has occurred. Determining the type of deviation that has occurred is called classifying the deviation. Deviations are relative to an expected time-channel unless the deviation is a Series Initiation. The following discussion, although expressed in terms of the method of FIG. 9, applies likewise to an algorithm that implement the method of FIG. 9.",
        "The method of FIG. 9 begins with step 32, which provides a TV series, a given week, and at least one of: TC1 (at least one time-channel for the TV series for the given week) and ECT (an expected time-channel for the series). Providing a TV series means providing identification of the TV series, and providing a given week mean identifying the given week. The ECT may obtained from any source such as, inter alia, a SSE Database Structure. The ECT may be generated in accordance with the method or algorithm of FIGS. 6-7.",
        "Decision step 34 acts based on whether TC1 has been provided. If TC1 has not been provided, then the method determines that a deviation has occurred and that said deviation is a Series Preemption 35.",
        "Decision step 36 is entered from step 34 if TC1 has been provided. Decision step 36 acts based on whether ETC has been provided. If ETC has not been provided, then the method determines that a deviation has occurred and that said deviation is a Series Initiation 37.",
        "Decision step 38 is entered from step 36 if ETC has been provided. Decision step 38 acts based on whether TC1 includes ETC. If TC1 does not include ETC, then the method determines that a deviation has occurred and that said deviation is a Series Move 39.",
        "Decision step 40 is entered from step 38 if TC1 includes ETC. Decision step 40 acts based on whether TC1 has exactly one time-channel. If TC1 has exactly one time-channel, then a deviation has not occurred (i.e., no deviation 42). If TC1 has more than one time-channel, then a deviation has occurred and decision block 44 is entered.",
        "Decision step 44 acts based on whether TC1 comprises three contiguous time-channels that do not include the ETC. If TC1 comprises three contiguous time-channels that do not include the ETC, then the method determines that a deviation has occurred and that said deviation is a Series Marathon 46. But if TC1 does not comprise three contiguous time-channels that do not include the ETC, then the method determines that a deviation has occurred and that said deviation is a Series Expansion 48.",
        "If a deviation is determined to have occurred as determined by the method of FIG. 9, then the deviation may be stored by the DDTV algorithm in a Deviation Database Structure, such as the Deviation Database Structure described supra in conjunction with FIG. 3 or FIG. 5. Additionally, the DDTV algorithm may generate a deviation report which displays some or all of the deviations that are stored in the Deviation Database Structure. Deviation report format include: column format, grid format, and text format.",
        "FIG. 10 illustrates a deviation report in column format, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The deviation report in column format comprises a header row (i.e., top row that describes each column) and at least one data row of deviation data. Each such row comprises deviation data relating to a program of a TV series for a given day of a given week, wherein the program is on a time-channel that deviates from an expected time-channel for the TV series. Each data row includes: an identifier of the program (e.g., \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d), a time-channel at which the program is on (e.g., Thursday, 9:00 pm, channel WPIX), and the expected time-channel (e.g., Thursday, 8:00 pm, channel WPIX). In FIG. 10, \u201cCurrent Week Day\u201d denotes the given day, and \u201cCurrent Week Time\u201d denotes the given time. Also in FIG. 10, \u201cExpected Week Day\u201d denotes the expected day, and \u201cExpected Week Time\u201d denotes the expected time.
