    "description": [
        "The present invention relates to a support frame and tray and in particular to a mattress supported tubular support frame and snap-on tray.",
        "There is often a need for a tray adjacent to a bed to hold various articles such as books, lamps, food, drinks, and the like. One solution is a tray with legs which support the tray above the floor. Unfortunately, such floor supported trays are often cumbersome and easily knocked over. Other solutions comprise trays supported by a frame residing between a mattress and box spring. Such frames generally comprise a flat plate residing horizontally when in use, and vertical members rising from the flat plate to support the tray. Unfortunately, such flat plates may slip between the mattress and box spring, and comprise several members raising production costs. Therefore, a need remains for a simple and stable mattress supported frame and tray.",
        "The present invention addresses the above and other needs by providing a tray supported by a tubular frame residing between a mattress and box spring. The frame is a single continuous loop of tubing having a substantially horizontally residing supported portion, a vertical center portion, and a substantially horizontal tray support portion. The tray is rectangular with a raised edge and includes clips residing on a tray bottom to snap onto the frame.",
        "In accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is provided a mattress supported frame and tray. The frame is a substantially round tubular frame having a supported portion, a center portion, and a tray support portion. The supported portion is substantially planar (i.e., may include some vertical variation, but not enough to affect the mattress) and has an inward end insertable under a mattress and an outward end opposite the inward end. The center portion is approximately orthogonal to the supported portion and has a lower end extending vertically from the outward end of the supported portion and a higher end opposite the lower end. The tray support portion is approximately parallel to the supported portion and extends horizontally from the higher end of the center portion, extending opposite the supported portion. The tray includes pairs of downwardly extending opposed clips configured to grasp the frame.",
        "In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided a mattress supported frame and tray having a continuous tube frame.",
        "The above and other aspects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more apparent from the following more particular description thereof, presented in conjunction with the following drawings wherein:",

The frame 20 includes a substantially planar supported portion 24, a center portion 26, and a tray support portion 28. The supported portion 24 has an inward end 24a insertable under the mattress 12 and an outward end 24b opposite the inward end 24a. The center portion 26 is preferably approximately orthogonal to the supported portion 24 and has a lower end 26a extending from the outward end 24b of the supported portion 24 and a higher end 26b opposite the lower end 26a. The center portion 26 is not necessarily orthogonal to the supported portion 24 but should have some vertical extent to raise the height of the tray 18 when in use. If the center portion 26 is sloped too much, the tray 18 may be displaced from the bed 10, however, in an alternative embodiment, a center portion may slope away from the bed 10, and the tray support portion 28 may be reversed and extend back towards the bed 10. The tray support portion 28 is approximately parallel to the supported portion 24 and extends from the higher end 26b of the center portion 26, extending opposite the supported portion 24. The tray support portion 28 comprises longitudinal portions 28a and a lateral portion 28b running between the longitudinal portions 28a, and the longitudinal portions 28a are preferably approximately parallel.",
        "The frame 20 has a width W1 which is preferably between approximately ten inches and approximately fourteen inches, and more preferably approximately twelve inches. The frame 20 has a height H1 which is preferably between approximately ten inches and approximately eighteen inches, and more preferably between approximately twelve inches and approximately sixteen inches.

The tubing preferably has an outside diameter between approximately \u00bd inches and \u00be inches and more preferably approximately \u215d inches.",
        "A detailed perspective view of the tray 18 is shown in FIG. 5, a front view of the tray 18 is shown in FIG. 6A, a side view of the tray 18 is shown in FIG. 6B, a top view of the tray 18 is shown in FIG. 6C, and a bottom view of the tray 18 is shown in FIG. 6D. The tray is approximately flat and has a top surface 18a which is preferably textured to reduce sliding. An edge 30 surrounds the tray 18 and provides stiffness. An upper edge portion 30a forms an edge around the top surface 18a to reduce the chance of items rolling or sliding off the tray top surface 18a. The edge 30 preferably includes a lower edge portion 30b extending downward to add stiffness.",
        "Attaching features 32 for attaching the tray 20 to the frame 18 are shown in FIG. 7. The attaching features reside on the a tray bottom surface 18b. The attaching features 32 are preferably spaced apart opposing clips or fingers which the tray support portion 28 of the frame 18 snaps into. More preferably, attaching features 32 are pairs of downwardly extending fingers with concave inner opposing surfaces 32a to retain the tray 20 once snapped onto the frame 18. Most preferably, the attaching features 32 comprise three pairs of spaced apart pairs (a total of six pairs of fingers) of downwardly extending fingers which snap onto the longitudinal portions 28a and the lateral portion 28b of the tray support portion 28. Alternatively, the three pairs of spaced apart pairs of fingers may be replaced by 3 pairs of continuous clips, one pair of clips for each of the longitudinal portions 28a and one pair of clips for the lateral portion 28b. In another instance, the attaching features may be screws or similar fasteners passing though holes in the tray support portion and into the tray, or adhesives to attach the tray to the frame.",
        "The tray 20 has a tray width W2, a tray length L4, and a tray thickness T. The tray length L4 is preferably approximately equal to the frame width W1 to facilitate packaging the frame and tray 20.",
        "While the invention herein disclosed has been described by means of specific embodiments and applications thereof, numerous modifications and variations could be made thereto by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention set forth in the claims."
