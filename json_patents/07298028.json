        "The invention relates to a circuit board and in particular to a printed circuit board (PCB) for a multi-package module for thermal dissipation and an electronic device using the same.",
        "Demand for small, high performance portable electronic products such as mobile phones, protable computers, and the like have driven the industry to increase integration on semiconductor dice. Accordingly, the industry is achieving high integration by turning to 3D packaging by combining assembly technologies including wire bonding or flip chip to stack die packages to form a multi-package module (MPM).",
        "MPM, a current assembly technology, integrates different dice functions, such as microprocessors or memory, logic, optic ICs, instead of placing individual packages onto a large printed circuit board (PCB). MPM, however, has a much higher power density than an individual single die package. Thus, thermal management is a key factor in its successful development.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional electronic device 100 with an MPM. The electronic device 100 comprises an MPM 20 mounted on a PCB 101, comprising a package substrate 12. The upper and lower surfaces of the package substrate 12 have dice 16 and 14 with different functions thereon, respectively, to create the MPM 20. For example, the die 16 is mounted on the upper surface of the package substrate 12 by bumps (or solder balls) of a package substrate 12\u2032. The die 14 is mounted on the lower surface of the package substrate 12 by flip chip. The lower surface of the package substrate 12 comprises a plurality of bumps 10 thereon to correspondingly connect to the bonding pads (not shown) on the PCB 101. In the MPM 20, heat generated from the die 16 can be dissipated by radiation and convection. The gap g between the die 14 and the PCB 101 is too narrow, however, to dissipate the generated heat by radiation and convection. Accordingly, the heat generated from the die 14 is dissipated by conduction only. Typically, a metal layer 102 is disposed on the PCB 101 corresponding to the die 14 and connected to the die 14 by a heat conductive paste 22. That is, thermal dissipation is accomplished by a thermal conductive path created by the heat conductive paste 22, the metal layer 102 and the PCB 101.",
        "Passive cooling, however, cannot provide a higher rate of adequate thermal dissipation for high power dice which may generate higher heat. That is, generated heat cannot be rapidly dissipated from dice by conducting the heat to the PCB through the heat conductive paste and the metal layer.",
        "A printed circuited board for thermal dissipation and an electronic device using the same are provided. An embodiment of a printed circuit board (PCB) for thermal dissipation comprises a substrate and a heat sink thereon. The heat sink comprises a first portion under the package substrate of the MPM.

FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate an embodiment of an electronic device with an MPM, wherein FIG. 2A is a bottom planar view of the electronic device and FIG. 2B is a cross-section along line 2B-2B of FIG. 2A.

The MPM 40 comprises a package substrate 32. The lower surface of the package substrate 32 has a die region 32a and at least one thermal channel region 32b and the upper surface of the package substrate 32 also has a die region (not shown). Here, the lower surface represents a surface facing the surface of a circuit board, such as a printed circuit board (PCB) and the upper surface represents the surface opposite to the lower surface. In this embodiment, the package substrate 32 may comprise plastic, ceramic, inorganic or organic material. Typically, the die region 32a is substantially at the center of the package substrate 32. Unlike the conventional package substrate, the package substrate 32 comprises at least one thermal channel region 32b outwardly extending to an edge of the package substrate 32 from the die region 32a. In some embodiments, the thermal channel region 32b may extend to an opposite edge of the package substrate 32 across the die region 32a, as shown in FIG. 3C. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the package substrate 32 may comprise one or more thermal channel regions extending to the edges of the package substrate 32 along different directions from the die region 32a. It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to FIGS. 3A and 3C.",
        "Dice 34 and 36 with different functions may be respectively mounted in the die region 32a of the lower surface and that of the upper surface of the package substrate 32 by the same or different electronic packages. For example, dice 34 and 36 may respectively be mounted on the package substrate 32 by flip chip or wire bonding.",
        "An array of bumps 30, such as metal bump, solder balls, signal balls or similar, is arranged on the lower surface of the package substrate 32 except in the die region 32a and the thermal channel region 32b, to transmit signals to external circuits from the dice 34 and 36. The interval between the bumps 30 is narrower than the width of the thermal channel region 32b.",

Typically, the circuit board 200 comprises at least one or more metal layers and at least one or more insulating layers, in which the metal layer may serve as a signal layer, a power layer, and/or a grounding layer. In order to simplify the diagram, a flat substrate 201 is depicted.",
        "A heat sink 203 is disposed on the circuit board 200 and between the circuit board 200 and the package substrate 32, comprising first and second portions 204 and 206. The first portion 204 corresponds to the die region 32a of the package substrate 32 and connected to the die 34 by a heat conductive paste 42. The second portion 206 is adjacent to the first portion 204 and extends outside the package substrate 32 along the thermal channel region 32b, in which the second portion 206 on the circuit board 200 outside the package substrate 32 comprises at least one fin 206a. For example, the second portion 206 on the circuit board 200 outside the package substrate 32 comprises a plurality of round fins 206a which are symmetrically arranged on both sides of the second portion 206. Moreover, the fins 206 extend substantially parallel to the surface of the circuit board 200. In some embodiments, the fins 206a may be alternately arranged on both sides of the second portion 206, as shown by the heat sink 203 in FIG. 2C. Additionally, in some embodiments, the fins 206a may be triangular (as shown in FIG. 2D), rectangular (as shown in FIG. 2E) or polygon (not shown). It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the triangular or rectangular fins 206a may be alternately arranged on both sides of the second portion 206 and it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to FIGS. 2D and 2E. In this embodiment, the heat sink 203 comprises gold, silver or copper. Moreover, the first portion 204 of the heat sink 203 may partially or fully overlap the die 34 or the die region 32a. Here, only an example of the full overlap is depicted. Note that the shape of the heat sink 203 may be varied with the design of the thermal channel region 32b.",
        "A thermal dissipation module 208 is disposed on the end of the second portion 206 of the heat sink 203 outside the package substrate 32, providing active thermal dissipation. In this embodiment, the thermal dissipation module 208 may comprise a fan 207 and an underlying heat dissipating component 205, such as a heat plate or pipe.",
        "According to the electronic device of the invention, the thermal channel region 32b can be formed by rearranging the bumps 30. Moreover, since the heat sink 203 may extend outside the package substrate 32 along the thermal channel region 32b, the heat generated from the die 34 on the lower surface of the package substrate 32 can be dissipated by radiation and convection through the fins 206a for passive cooling. At the same time, the heat can be effectively and rapidly dissipated to the ambient environment by radiation, convection and conduction through the dissipating component 205, as shown by the arrows in FIG. 3B. Additionally, if the die 34 is a high power die, the heat can be dissipated quickly by the fan 207 for active cooling. Compared to conventional thermal dissipation by conduction of the circuit board, the electronic device with MPM 40 of the invention has better thermal dissipation and a higher thermal dissipation rate.",

Unlike the embodiment of FIGS. 2A and 2B, the thermal conductive path is formed by defining a metal layer 209 of the circuit board 200. Here, the circuit board 200, such as a PCB, comprises a substrate 201 and a metal layer 209 thereon. In this embodiment, the metal layer 209 comprises a first portion 210, a second portion 212 and a third portion 214. The first portion 210 of the metal layer 209 is under the die region 32a and is connected to the die 34 by a heat conductive paste 42. The second portion 212 of the metal layer 209 is adjacent to the first portion 210 and extends outside the package substrate 32 along the thermal channel region 32b, in which the second portion 212 on the circuit board 200 outside the package substrate 32 comprises at least one fin 212a. The third portion 214 of the metal layer 209 is adjacent to the end of the second portion 212 on the circuit board 200 outside of the package substrate 32. For example, the second portion 212 on the circuit board 200 outside the package substrate 32 comprises a plurality of round fin 212a which are symmetrically arranged on both sides of the second portion 212. Moreover, the fins 212 extend-substantially parallel to the surface of the circuit board 200. In some embodiments, the fins 212a may be alternately arranged on both sides of the second portion 212, as shown by the metal layer 209 in FIG. 4C. Additionally, in some embodiments, the fins 206a may be triangular (as shown in FIG. 4D), rectangular (as shown in FIG. 4E) or polygon (not shown) It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the triangular or rectangular fins 212a may be alternately arranged on both sides of the second portion 212 and it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to FIGS. 4D and 4E. In this embodiment, the metal layer 209 comprises gold, silver or copper. Moreover, the first portion 204 of the metal layer 209 may partially or fully overlap the die 34 or the die region 32a. Here, only an example of the full overlap is depicted. Note that the shape of the metal layer 209 may be varied with the design of the thermal channel region 32b. The first and second portions 210 and 212 of the metal layer 209 serve as a heat sink to conduct heat generated from the die 34 outside the package substrate 32. The third portion 214 of the metal layer 209 serves as a heat dissipating component to dissipate heat to the ambient environment by a fan 207 disposed thereon, as shown by the arrows in FIG. 4B.",
        "In this embodiment, since the metal layer 209 may extend outside the package substrate 32 along the thermal channel region 32b, the heat generated from the die 34 on the lower surface of the package substrate 32 can be effectively and rapidly dissipated to the ambient environment by radiation, convection and conduction. Compared to the conventional thermal dissipation by conduction of the circuit board, the electronic device with MPM 40 has better thermal dissipation and a higher thermal dissipation rate. Moreover, since the metal layer 209 is included in the circuit board 200, no additional heat sink or heat dissipating component are required.",
        "While the invention has been described by way of example and in terms of preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. To the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements (as would be apparent to those skilled in the art). Therefore, the scope of the appended claims should be accorded the broadest interpretation to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements."
