        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an X-ray diagnostic apparatus having a C-arm.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "In diagnosis or medical treatment based on angiography, a device such as a guide wire or catheter is inserted into a blood vessel. An operator advances a device to a morbid region of a subject in diagnosis of the morbid region while referring to fluoroscopic image data obtained by fluoroscopy and reference image data obtained by imaging at the same position as that of the fluoroscopic image data upon injecting a contrast medium in advance by using an X-ray diagnostic apparatus for circulatory organs.",
        "In addition, in many cases, an operator advances a device to a morbid region while calling up and checking, on a monitor, fluoroscopic image data for displaying a blood vessel structure in real time by temporarily injecting a small amount of contrast medium into the blood vessel and reference image data.",
        "Furthermore, an operator often advances a device to a morbid region while displaying and checking, on a monitor, image data (fluoroscopic road map image data) in which a blood vessel image and a guide wire image are extracted by subtraction processing for fluoroscopic image data for displaying a blood vessel structure, which is obtained in real time, and reference image data obtained in advance by imaging at the same position as that of the fluoroscopic image data.",
        "When a morbid region to be treated is determined to some extent, an operator advances a device inserted into the blood vessel or performs medical treatment while observing the morbid region from at least two positions by displaying fluoroscopic image data and reference image data or fluoroscopic road map image data concerning the morbid region on the monitor. In addition, an observation region is imaged as needed.",
        "An X-ray diagnostic apparatus for circulatory organs comprises an X-ray generating unit which applies X-rays to a subject, an X-ray detecting unit which is positioned to face the X-ray generating unit through the subject and detects X-rays, and a C-arm which holds the X-ray generating unit and the X-ray detecting unit. It is known that X-ray diagnostic apparatuses for circulatory organs include a single plane system comprising one C-arm and a biplane system comprising two C-arms (see, for example, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2001-137222).",
        "In the present circumstances, although an X-ray diagnostic apparatus of the biplane system requires no complicated operation for the movement of the C-arms because observations from two positions can be simultaneously performed by using the two C-arms, the apparatus demands a large installation area and is expensive, and hence its installation is limited.",
        "In contrast, an X-ray diagnostic apparatus of the single plane system does not demand a large installation area and is inexpensive as compared with that of the biplane system, and hence is installed in many places.",
        "In the single plane system, however, every time the observation position is changed, the C-arm must be moved, and image data such as fluoroscopic image data, reference image data, and fluoroscopic road map image data at the position to which the C-arm is moved must be displayed. These operations must be manually performed using an operating unit. Such operations are cumbersome and difficult for an operator who manually operates a device such as a catheter or guide wire during diagnosis or medical treatment.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to improve operability in moving a C-arm and performing imaging operation in an X-ray diagnostic apparatus.",

        "According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided an X-ray diagnostic apparatus comprising an X-ray generating unit which generates X-rays, an X-ray detecting unit which detects X-rays transmitted through a subject, a C-arm on which the X-ray generating unit and the X-ray detecting unit are mounted, a support mechanism which movably supports the C-arm, a high voltage generating unit which generates a high voltage for generating X-rays from the X-ray generating unit, a foot switch to input a user instruction, a preset window generating unit which generates a preset window for presetting an action associated with at least one of generation of the X-rays and movement of the C-arm in accordance with the input of the user instruction, and a control unit which controls at least one of the high voltage generating unit and the support mechanism in accordance with the preset action when the user instruction is input.",

        "A compensating filter 12 is placed between the X-ray tube 11 and the subject P and comprises a filter and a filter driving mechanism which moves the filter. When this filter driving mechanism sets the filter at a position as a photographing condition, some of X-rays transmitted through the filter are absorbed.",
        "The X-ray stop 13 is placed between the X-ray tube 11 and the subject P and comprises upper and lower blades and an X-ray stop aperture driving mechanism which moves the upper and lower blades.

Note that the detection of X-rays by X-ray detecting unit 2 may be performed by using an image intensifier which converts X-rays into light and then converts the light into electric charges.",
        "The flat panel detector 21 is placed to face the X-ray generating unit 1 through the subject P and is formed by two-dimensionally arraying minute detection elements in the column and line directions. Each detection element comprises a photoelectric film which detects X-rays and generates electric charges in accordance with the amount of incident X-rays, an electric charge storage capacitor which stores electric charges generated in the photoelectric film, and a TFT (Thin-Film Transistor) which reads out electric charges stored in the electric charge storage capacitor at a predetermined timing.",
        "The projection data generating unit 23 parallelly reads out electric charges from the flat panel detector 21 on a line basis, and digitally converts them into a digital signal to generate X-ray projection data.",

With the back-and-forth movement of the X-ray flat panel detector 21, a distance (SID) between the stop 15 and the X-ray flat panel detector 21 is set as a photographing condition.",

Referring to FIG. 2A showing the schematic arrangement of the C-arm rotating/moving mechanism 31 and the column rotating/moving mechanism 33, which are used to move the C-arm 5, the C-arm 5 is held on an arm holding unit 36 so as to be freely slid in a direction R2 by the C-arm rotating/moving mechanism 31. In addition, the arm holding unit 36 is held on the column 35 so as to be freely rotated about the body axis of subject P as a rotation axis in a direction R1 by the C-arm rotating/moving mechanism 31. Furthermore, the column 35 is held on a ceiling (not shown) so as to be rotated about the axis of the column 35 as a rotation axis in a direction R3 and translated in a longitudinal direction L1 and a widthwise direction L2 by the column rotating/moving mechanism 33.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2B, the X-ray generating unit 1 and the X-ray detecting unit 2 rotate about a morbid region (e.g., the heart) of the subject P as a rotation center (isocenter) C0 of an X-ray beam in the first oblique direction (RAO) and the second oblique direction (LAO) upon rotation of the C-arm 5 as the arm holding unit 36 rotates in the direction R1.",

        "That is, the positions of the X-ray generating unit 1 and X-ray detecting unit 2 in directions RAO, LAO, CRA, and CAU as photographing conditions are set by rotation and sliding of the C-arm 5. This position setting makes it possible to perform X-ray fluoroscopy and imaging of the subject P from an arbitrary angle. In addition, the positions of the X-ray generating unit 1 and X-ray detecting unit 2 in the directions R3, L1, and L2 of column 35 are set.",
