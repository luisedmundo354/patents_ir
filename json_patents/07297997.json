A flash memory is an example of a non-volatile memory device.",

Recently, attraction for a memory device having the advantages of both the volatile memory device and the non-volatile memory device is increasing. As a result, various types of memory devices have been introduced. FIG. 1 illustrates one conventional memory device introduced recently. This is a ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM) with a cob structure including a ferroelectric capacitor formed on a bit line.",

A portion of the first interlayer insulating layer 18 is removed to form a first contact hole 20 exposing a source region 12 of the transistor Tr. A bit line 22 is formed on the first interlayer insulating layer 18, filling the first contact hole 20. A second interlayer insulating layer 24 covering the bit line 22 is formed on the first interlayer insulating layer 18 and the bit line 22. A second contact hole 25 exposing a drain region 14 is formed by penetrating the first interlayer insulating layer 18 and the second interlayer insulating layer 24. The second contact hole 25 is filled with a conductive plug 26. A bottom electrode 28 covering the conductive plug 26 is formed on the second interlayer insulating layer 24. The bottom electrode 28 is covered with a lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) layer 30. The PZT layer 30 is covered with a top electrode 32.

A plate line 36 connected to the top electrode 32 is formed on the third interlayer insulating layer 34.",

        "Referring to FIG. 2, a substrate 40, for example a P-type substrate, is provided with a field effect transistor T1. The field effect transistor T1 includes source and drain regions 42 and 44 spaced apart from each other and doped with conductive impurities and a stacked gate structure 46 formed on a portion of the substrate 40 between the source region 42 and the drain region 44. The stacked gate structure 46 includes, e.g., a gate insulating layer and a gate electrode.",
        "An interlayer insulating layer 48 covering the field effect transistor T1 is formed on the substrate 40. A first conductive plug 50 and a second conductive plug 52 pass through portions of the interlayer insulating layer 48 and are respectively connected to the source region 42 and the drain region 44. The first conductive plug 50 and the second conductive plug 52 may be conductive materials or semiconductive materials doped with conductive impurities. A first bottom electrode 54 and a second bottom electrode 56 exist on top of the interlayer insulating layer 48 and the first and second conductive plugs 50 and 52, respectively. The first bottom electrode 54 and the second bottom electrode 56 are spaced apart and respectively connected to the source region 42 and the drain region 44 through the first conductive plug 50 and the second conductive plug 52.",
        "A dielectric layer 58 covering the first bottom electrode 54 and the second bottom electrode 56 is formed on the interlayer insulating layer 48. The dielectric layer 58 is a common dielectric layer. For example, the dielectric layer 58 may include a PZT layer and/or a bismuth titanate (BIT) layer, but may also include other typical dielectric materials.",
        "A top electrode 60 is formed on the dielectric layer 58. The top electrode 60 surrounds the first bottom electrode 54 and the second bottom electrode 56. The top electrode 60 is discontinuous at the tops of the first bottom electrode 54 and the second bottom electrode 56. That is, the top electrode 60 is continuous on the dielectric layer 58 and up to the top of the first bottom electrode 54 and up to the top of the adjacent second bottom electrode 56, but is discontinuous in regions above the first bottom electrode 54 and the second bottom electrode 56.",
        "Each of a plurality of plate lines 62 is placed on the top electrode 60. Such plate lines 62 can be electrically isolated from each other via switching components (not depicted). The plate lines 62 fill the spaces between the first bottom electrode 54 and the second bottom electrode 56. A group including the first bottom electrode 54, the dielectric layer 58 and the top electrode 60 defines a first capacitor C1 that is connected to the source region 42. Another group including the second bottom electrode 56, the dielectric layer 58, and the top electrode 60 define a second capacitor C2 that is connected to the drain region 44.",

In view of the first capacitor C1 and the second capacitor C2, each of the first capacitor C1 and the second capacitor C2 includes the two top electrodes 60 separated from each other. When the power is supplied via plate lines 62, the power is supplied to both the first capacitor C1 and the second capacitor C2 because the top electrode 60 in contact with the plate lines 62 is also in contact with the first capacitor C1 and the second capacitor C2.",

        "In FIG. 3, the NAND memory device 38 is formed by connecting a plurality of transistors in series to one bit line. Although the bit line is connected to the second transistor T2 and the third transistor T3, this connection is not illustrated in FIG. 3.",
        "The field effect transistor T1 and its neighbors (a second transistor T2 and a third transistor T3 in FIG. 3) are all used to control the first capacitor C1. When the field effect transistor T1 is turned off, the second transistor T2 is turned on, and the third transistor T3 is turned off, data (e.g., \u20180\u2019 or \u20181\u2019) can be written to a first region A1 of the dielectric layer 58 included in the first capacitor C1. In FIG. 3, when the on/off states of the second transistor T2 and the third transistor T3 are inverted, data may be written to a second region A2 of the dielectric layer 58 included in the second capacitor C2. This operating method will be described in more detail.",
        "The first capacitor C1 and the second capacitor C2 (connected respectively via the first conductive plug 50 and the second conductive plug 52 to the source region 42 and the drain region 44 of the field effect transistor T1) are one example of various storage nodes capable of storing data. Therefore, the first capacitor C1 and the second capacitor C2 may be replaced with other types of storage nodes. For example, the first capacitor C1 and the second capacitor C2 may be storage nodes that do not include a capacitor, such as resistive RAM or phase change RAM (PRAM) storage nodes, etc. In other words, the first and the second storage nodes may be adapted for use as the storage nodes in RAM-type memory devices such as PRAM, RRAM, etc. A detailed description of these various types of storage nodes will be provided later.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 2, a unit cell of the semiconductor memory device 38 includes one transistor and two storage nodes connected respectively to the source region and the drain region of the transistor. Again, as described above, the two storage nodes may be formed in various structures. Hence, the two-storage-node architecture of the semiconductor memory device 38 is capable of storing one bit of data in each storage node, and as a result, can store 2 bits of data (e.g., \u201800\u2019, \u201801\u2019, \u201810\u2019, or \u201811\u2019) per unit cell.",

Like reference numerals denote like elements even in different drawings.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4, a source region 42 and a drain region 44 are formed in a doped substrate 40, for example, a P-type substrate. The source region 42 is spaced apart from the drain region 44. A stacked gate structure 46 is formed on the substrate 40 between the source region 42 and the drain region 44. The stacked gate structure 46, e.g., includes a gate insulating layer and a gate electrode, which are sequentially deposited. A group including the source region 42, the drain region 44 and the stacked gate structure 46 define a field effect transistor (hereinafter, referred to as a transistor). A first interlayer insulating layer L1 (corresponding to layer 48 of FIG. 2) covering the transistor is formed on the substrate 40 and then planarized. A first contact hole h1 and a second contact hole h2 are formed in the first interlayer insulating layer L1. The first contact hole h1 and the second contact hole h2 respectively expose the source region 42 and the drain region 44. Afterwards, a first conductive plug 50 and a second conductive plug 52 respectively fill the first and second contact holes h1 and h2.",
        "Referring to FIG. 5, a second interlayer insulating layer L2, an etch barrier layer 70 and a third interlayer insulating layer L3 are sequentially formed on the first interlayer insulating layer L1. The etch barrier layer 70 protects the second interlayer insulating layer L2 in a subsequent wet etching process.",
        "Referring to FIG. 6, a first via hole b1 exposing the first conductive plug 50 and a second via hole b2 exposing the second conducive plug 52 are formed in a stack structure S including the second interlayer insulating layer L2, the etch barrier layer 70 and the third interlayer insulating layer L3.",
        "Referring to FIG. 7, a conductive layer 53 filling the first and second via holes b1 and b2 is formed on the stack structure S. A planarization process is performed on the conductive layer 53 until the stack structure S is exposed. As a result of the planarization process, as shown in FIG. 8, a first bottom electrode 54 filling the first via hole b1 and a second bottom electrode 56 filling the second via hole b2 are formed.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 9, the third interlayer insulating layer L3 between the first bottom electrode 54 and the second bottom electrode 56 is removed from the intermediary configuration shown in FIG. 8. The third interlayer insulating layer L3 may be removed using, e.g., an etching method. For example, a wet etching method using an etchant with a high etch selectivity ratio with respect to the etch barrier layer 70 may be employed to remove the third interlayer insulating layer L3. The wet etching exposes the sidewalls of the first bottom electrode 54 and the second bottom electrode 56. The etch barrier layer 70 may be removed after the removal of the third interlayer insulating layer L3, although it is not necessary to remove the etch barrier layer 70.",
        "Referring to FIG. 10, a dielectric layer 58\u2032 covering the first and second bottom electrodes 54 and 56 is formed on the etch barrier layer 70. The dielectric layer 58\u2032 may be formed of, e.g., a low-k material such as silicon oxide, a ferroelectric material such as PZT or BIT, etc. Here, the dielectric layer 58\u2032, the etch barrier layer 70 (should it be retained) and the first interlayer insulating layer L1 correspond to the dielectric layer 58 in FIG. 2.",
        "Referring to FIG. 11, a top electrode 60 is formed on the dielectric layer 58\u2032. For example, the top electrode 60 can be formed to a thickness that does not completely fill the spaces between the first bottom electrode 54 and the second bottom electrode 56. Further, the top electrode 60 is formed to be discontinuous over the tops of (above) the first and second bottom electrodes 54 and 56 but continuous between the first bottom electrode 54 and the second bottom electrode 56. This type of the top electrode 60 can be easily obtained through a photolithography process. On the basis of the above-described operations, the memory device 38 (including one transistor and two capacitors C1 and C2 connected respectively with the source region 42 and the drain region 44 of the transistor) is provided. Afterwards, a plurality of plate lines 62 are formed on the top electrode 60, filling the spaces between first bottom electrode 54 and the second bottom electrode 56. Although not illustrated, a bit line connected to the source and drain regions 42 and 44 may be formed before or after the plate lines 62 are formed.",
        "A detailed description of an operating method according to an example embodiment of the present invention, for a semiconductor memory device will now be provided. Particularly, a semiconductor memory device including a capacitor as a storage node, e.g., the two-storage-node architecture of the semiconductor memory device 38, is used as an example. The operating method set forth herein may also be applied to a memory device including a storage node that does not include a capacitor.",
        "First, a write operation will be described. Like reference numerals denote like elements even in different drawings.",
        "FIGS. 12-13 illustrate an example in which 2 bits of data are written to a first capacitor C1 and a second capacitor C2 connected respectively to the source region 42 and drain region 44 of a first transistor T1 in the NAND memory device 64 of FIG. 3. It is assumed that the first and second capacitors C1 and C2 are ferroelectric capacitors.",
        "In FIG. 12, the first transistor T1 and third transistor T3 are turned off, and the second transistor T2 is turned on. A voltage for the write operation, for example, approximately 5 V, is supplied to a bit line BL, and a ground voltage, for example, approximately 0 V, is supplied to a plate line 62 between the first capacitor C1 and the second capacitor C2 of the first transistor T1. Other plate lines 62a and 62b are not supplied with a voltage. That is, the other plate lines 62a and 62b are floated. An electric potential difference is generated between a first bottom electrode 54 and a top electrode 60 of the first transistor T1. The electric potential difference is generated at a first region A1 of the dielectric layer 58. Accordingly, the first portion A1 of the dielectric layer 58 is polarized in a first direction. When the first region A1 of the dielectric layer 58 is polarized as described above, it is considered that data, e.g., \u20181\u2019 is written to the first region A1.",
        "After this write operation, as illustrated in FIG. 13, the first transistor T1 is kept off, the second transistor T2 is turned off and the third transistor T3 is turned on. At this time, the voltages supplied to the bit line BL and the plate line 62 are maintained, e.g., the same as the above. Except for the plate line 62, the other plate lines 62a and 62b are floated. As a result, an electric potential difference is generated between the second bottom electrode 56 and the top electrode 60 of the first transistor T1. The electric potential difference is generated at a second region of the dielectric layer 58, and thus the second region A2 of the dielectric layer 58 is polarized in a second direction at least substantially antiparallel to the first direction. This polarization direction of the second region A2 of the dielectric layer 58 is illustrated in FIG. 13. When the second region A2 of the dielectric layer 58 is polarized as shown in FIG. 13, it is considered that data, e.g., \u20181\u2019 is written to the second region A2. When the first region A1 of the dielectric layer 58 has the second polarization direction and/or the second region A2 of the dielectric layer 58 has the first polarization direction, it is considered that data, e.g., \u20180\u2019 is written in the first region A1 and/or the second region A2. This result may be obtained when the bit line BL is supplied with approximately, e.g., 0 V and the plate line 62 is supplied with a voltage for the write operation, for example, approximately 5 V.",
        "FIGS. 14 and 15 illustrate an example in which two bits of data \u201801\u2019 are written to the memory device 64 of FIG. 3 (including a first capacitor C1, a second capacitor C2 and a first transistor T1) (hereinafter referred to as a 2-bit memory device). FIG. 14 illustrates the operation of writing data \u20180\u2019 to a first region A1 of a dielectric layer 58, and FIG. 15 illustrates the operation of writing data \u20181\u2019 to a second region A2 while data \u20180\u2019 is maintained at the first region A1. Similarly, the above-described operating method can be used to write two bits of data in the patterns \u201810\u2019 and \u201800\u2019 to the 2-bit memory device, respectively.",
        "When the first and second capacitors C1 and C2, which are storage nodes of the 2-bit memory device, are storage nodes of PRAM, the write operation can be, e.g., identical except for the magnitude and direction of the supplied current.",
        "A read operation will now be described.",
        "When the first and second capacitors C1 and C2 are used as storage nodes, the read operation of 2 bits of data written to the 2-bit memory device can be, e.g., identical to that of a FRAM. For example, a voltage for the read operation, e.g., approximately 5 V, is supplied to the plate line 62, and approximately 0 V is supplied to the bit line BL. At this time, the polarization direction corresponding to the data \u20180\u2019 (i.e., the polarization of the first region A1 of the dielectric layer 58 in FIG. 14) does not change. However, the polarization direction corresponding to the data \u20181\u2019 (i.e., the polarization of the first and second regions A1 and A2 of the dielectric layer 58 in FIG. 13) is inverted. Hence, after reading the data \u20181\u2019, a voltage opposite to the read voltage is supplied to revert the polarization to its state before the read operation.",
        "Another semiconductor memory device will now be described. FIG. 16 is a sectional view of a memory device 78 with a dual storage node according to an example embodiment of the present invention. Elements identical to those discussed above will not be described.",
        "Referring to FIG. 16, a plurality of bottom electrodes 80 are formed on an interlayer insulating layer 48, covering the first and second conductive plugs 50 and 52. A first insulating layer 82 fills the spaces between the bottom electrodes 80. A storage node layer 84 covering the bottom electrodes 80 is formed on the first insulating layer 82.",
        "The storage node layer 84 may be a storage node layer, e.g., of a PRAM or a RRAM. More specifically, the storage node layer 84 may include, e.g., a material whose resistance changes with current or a phase change layer whose resistance differs before and after the phase of its local region is changed. The storage node layer 84 may include, e.g., a material having a minimum resistance higher than the resistance of the first transistor T1, the second transistor T2 or the third transistor T3 when the same are turned on, respectively. For example, the minimum resistance of the material may be approximately 100 times higher than the resistance of the first transistor T1, the second transistor T2 or the third transistor T3. Since the characteristics of the storage node layer 84 are not related to the surface area, increasing the surface area is unnecessary, unlike for the capacitor. Accordingly, the storage node layer 84 with a flat structure or a slightly curved three-dimensional structure is sufficient.",
        "A plurality of top electrodes 86 are formed on the storage node layer 84. At this time, each of the top electrodes 86 corresponds to or shares two bottom electrodes 80. That is, the top electrodes 86 and the bottom electrodes 80 are staggered so that one edge of each top electrode 86 overlaps a first bottom electrode 80, while the other edge of each top electrode 86 overlaps a neighboring second bottom electrode 80. From the point of view of the bottom electrodes 80, one bottom electrode 80 corresponds to or shares two top electrodes 86.",
        "Second insulating layers 88 are formed to cover the top electrodes 86 and otherwise exposed portions of the storage node layer 84 therebetween. A plurality of via holes 90 exposing the top electrodes 86 are formed in the second insulating layer 88. A plurality of plate lines 92, 94 and 96 are formed on the second insulating layer 88, filling the via holes 90. The plate lines 92, 94 and 96 are perpendicular to a bit line BL and parallel to a word line (not shown).",
        "In the case of the memory device 78 illustrated in FIG. 16, the read operation may be performed according to the read operation of a PRAM or a RRAM depending, e.g., on the material of the storage node layer 84.",
        "FIG. 17 is a diagram showing an equivalent circuit relative to the memory device 78 of FIG. 16.",
        "In FIG. 17, reference numerals b1 to b4 and P1 to P4 respectively represent bit lines and plate lines. Reference numeral 102 denotes a storage node. Although the storage node is expressed as a capacitor for the sake of convenience, the storage node may also include a material, e.g., whose resistance changes with current or a phase change layer whose resistance differs before and after the phase of its local region is changed, etc., as explained in FIG. 16. A dotted circle 100 in FIG. 17 represents a region where a transistor is formed. For simplicity, no reference numeral has been given to the transistor.",
        "When the storage nodes 102 in FIG. 17 correspond to the storage node layer 84 illustrated in FIG. 16, then the minimum resistance (hereinafter referred to as the node resistance) of the selected storage node 102, e.g., is higher than the resistance of the corresponding transistor which is turned on, at the transistor region 100, in order to reduce (if not minimize) the chance of interference from other storage nodes during the read operation. For example, the node resistance can be approximately 100 times higher than the transistor resistance.",
        "According to one or more embodiments of the present invention, a memory device includes one transistor and two storage nodes. One of the two storage nodes is connected to a source region of the transistor, while the other storage node is connected to a drain region thereof. The two adjacent transistors sharing the source region share the storage node connected to the source region. The two adjacent transistors sharing the drain region share the storage node connected to the drain region. This configuration is equivalent to the configuration of a semiconductor memory device including a ferroelectric capacitor, wherein the ferroelectric capacitor is separated into two parts, which are then connected respectively to the source region and the drain region. According to one or more additional embodiments of the present invention, the two-storage-node architecture of such a semiconductor memory device may be used within a structure similar to a NAND memory device, wherein a plurality of transistors are connected to one bit line.",
        "Accordingly, compared with the conventional semiconductor memory device including one transistor and one storage node, the integration scale of a semiconductor memory device according to one or more embodiments of the present invention can be improved, and multi-bits can be written in each unit cell.",
        "While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to example embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims. For example, those skilled in the art are able to form a dielectric layer which is discontinuous, beneath a plate line and a first capacitor and a second capacitor, in various ways, or to form a bit line above the plate line.
