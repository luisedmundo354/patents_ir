        "The present invention relates to a semiconductor integrated circuit including a standard cell, a standard cell layout design method, and a layout design software product stored in a computer-readable recording medium.",
        "In layout design of a semiconductor integrated circuit, a method of laying out standard cells having a predetermined height in the vertical direction (row direction) is employed.",
        "FIG. 10 shows the structure of a typical standard cell. This standard cell has an inverter circuit structure including one p-channel transistor and one n-channel transistor. A gate electrode G, an n-well W1 in which a p-channel transistor is formed, and a p-well W2 in which an n-channel transistor is formed are laid out in correspondence with a planar structure formed on the surface portion of a semiconductor substrate. A space ha necessary in terms of design rules is present at the well boundary between the n-well W1 and the p-well W2.",
        "When only logic is taken into consideration, the chip area can be reduced by making each standard cell small. Hence, the total area of a chip can be reduced by forming a standard cell having a small height.",
        "In this case, however, the driving capability of one standard cell is low. To form a standard cell with a high driving capability, standard cells SC1 must be arrayed vertically in a plurality of stages, as shown in FIG. 11. As a circuit, inverters having identical structures are connected in parallel.",
        "As described above, the space ha is necessary at the well boundary. This decreases the efficiency of the area usable as transistors. The more the standard cells stacked in the vertical direction, the larger the space ha becomes.",
        "When a height h1 of the standard cell is set small, the height in the vertical direction can be suppressed small. However, the length in the horizontal direction must be increased. A cell having a small height and a large width is not preferable from the viewpoint of the degree of freedom in standard cell layout in a chip. Hence, there is a limitation on suppressing the height h1.",
        "Conventionally, standard cells having one kind of vertical height (h1) are laid out. As shown in FIG. 12, one row region includes a structure having two stages of standard cells SC1 stacked vertically, a structure having one stage of standard cell SC1, and a structure having three stages of standard cells SC1. Hence, bent portions R1 and R2 form which connect a power supply voltage line Vcc and a ground voltage line Vss arranged on the upper and lower sides of the row region to the cells in different numbers of stages, resulting in a waste of area.",
        "As described above, conventionally, standard cells having one kind of vertical height are stacked in a plurality of stages in accordance with the driving capability. Accordingly, the area efficiency decreases.",

        "A semiconductor integrated circuit including a standard cell, a standard cell layout design method, and a layout design software product stored in a computer-readable recording medium according to the embodiment of the present invention will be described below.",
        "In this embodiment, a plurality of kinds of standard cells having different vertical heights are prepared in accordance with the driving capability required for a circuit.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1, in addition to a standard cell SC1 having a smallest height h1 and a lowest driving capability, a standard cell SC2 having a driving capability, e.g., twice that of the standard cell SC1 is prepared. The standard cells SC1 and SC2 have the same horizontal size.",

        "On the other hand, the standard cell SC2 has the gate electrode G, p-well W11, and n-well W12. A space hb is present at the well boundary.",
        "The vertical height of the structure including one stage of standard cell SC2 is smaller by 2\u00d7ha than in the structure including two stages of standard cells SC1 stacked vertically. Hence, as shown in FIG. 2, the height of the two stages of standard cells SC1 and that of one stage of standard cell SC2 have a relationship given by\n\nh2=2\u00d7h1\u22122\u00d7ha\u2003\u2003(1)",

As shown in FIG. 3, a height 3\u00d7ha of a structure including three stages of standard cells SC1 stacked vertically and the height of one stage of standard cell SC3 have a relationship given by\n\nh3=3\u00d7h1\u22123\u00d7ha\u2003\u2003(2)",
        "Consider a case in which a standard cell SCn having a driving capability n-times (n is an integer; n\u22672) that of the standard cell SC1 is prepared. As shown in FIG. 4, a height n\u00d7ha of a structure including n stages of standard cells SC1 stacked vertically and the height of one stage of standard cell SCn have a relationship given by\n\nhn=n\u00d7h1\u2212n\u00d7ha\u2003\u2003(3)",
        "The plurality of kinds of standard cells SC1 to SCn having different vertical heights are prepared and selectively used in accordance with the driving capability. Accordingly, as compared to a structure including one kind of standard cells having the height h1 stacked vertically, the vertical height and the chip area can be reduced while ensuring the same driving capability.",
        "Row regions RSC1 to RSCn having heights corresponding to the vertical heights h1, h2, h3, . . . , hn of the standard cells SC1 to SCn are prepared for the respective standard cells. When the standard cell SC1 is allocated to the row region RSC1, the standard cell SC2 is allocated to the row region RSC2, and the standard cell SC3 is allocated to the row region RSC3, the total area of the chip can further be reduced.",
        "FIG. 5 is a flowchart showing the procedures of a standard cell layout design method according to this embodiment.",
        "This layout design method can be stored in a computer-readable recording medium (e.g., a CD-ROM, an MO disk, or a floppy disk) as software which causes a computer to execute the layout design. When a computer is caused to load this program and execute the layout design, a layout apparatus having an arrangement shown in FIG. 6 can be implemented.",
        "This apparatus comprises an input unit 101 which inputs data given by an operator, an arithmetic unit 102 which executes processing to be described later by using the input data and data stored in a storage unit 103 in advance, the storage unit 103 which stores the arithmetic result or the data input from the input unit 101, and an output unit 104 which outputs the arithmetic result or the data stored in the storage unit 103 as needed.",
        "In step S10 in the flow chart of FIG. 5, data about the plurality of kinds of standard cells SC1 to SCn having different heights, and for example, data such as the vertical sizes h1 to hn and driving capabilities of the standard cells SC1 to SCn are input to the input unit 101 and stored in the storage unit 103.",
        "In step S12, data about the circuit structure of an integrated circuit is input to the input unit 101. The arithmetic unit 102 calculates the number of each of the plurality of kinds of standard cells SC1 to SCn on the basis of the driving capability required the circuit structure. The arithmetic unit 102 also calculates the area necessary for each of the standard cells SC1 to SCn. For example, when the area necessary for laying out one standard cell SC1 is A (A>0), and M (M is an integer; M\u22671) standard cells SC1 are required, an area A1\u00d7M1 is necessary.",
        "In step S14, on the basis of the area obtained for each of the standard cells SC1 to SCn, the arithmetic unit 102 calculates the numbers of stages of row regions RSC1 to RSCn. For example, the total area necessary for laying out the standard cells SC1 is A1\u00d7M1, and the area of one stage of the row region RSC1 for the standard cells SC1 is R1, the number of stages is determined from A1\u00d7M1/R1 (the fractional portion is rounded up).",
        "For example, assume that three stages of row regions RSC1, one stage of row region RSC2, and two stages of row regions RSC3 are necessary. First, as shown in FIG. 7, the row regions are arrayed in the vertical direction sequentially from, e.g., the lower side.",
        "In step S16, circuit network information is input to the input unit 101. The arithmetic unit 102 obtains the wiring length when the standard cells SC1 to SCn are laid out in the arrayed state of the row regions RSC1 to RSC3 shown in FIG. 7.",
        "The array of the row regions RSC1 to RSC3 is changed such that the critical wiring length that decides the operation of the entire integrated circuit. That is, the structure is optimized such that the integrated circuit can obtain a desired operation speed. For example, the arrayed state of the row regions RSC1 to RSC3 shown in FIG. 7 is changed by arraying, vertically from the lower side, one stage of row region RSC1, one stage of row region RSC2, one stage of row region RSC1, two stages of row regions RSC3, and one stage of row region RSC1, as shown in FIG. 8.",
        "In step S18, the arithmetic unit 102 lays out the standard cells SC1 to SC3 respectively in the row regions RSC1 to RSC3 having the optimized array. After that, the output unit 104 outputs the arithmetic result.",
        "When the standard cells SC1 to SCn are respectively laid out in the row regions RSC1 to RSCn, as shown in FIG. 9, power supply voltage lines Vcc and ground voltage lines Vss can linearly be arranged. The bent portions R1 and R2 which are conventionally formed as described with reference to FIG. 12 can be eliminated, and the area efficiency can be increased.",
        "According to this embodiment, the plurality of kinds of standard cells SC1 to SCn having different heights are set in advance. The standard cells are laid out in the dedicated row regions RSC1 to RSCn in accordance with the necessary driving capability. Accordingly, the chip area can be reduced as compared to the conventional structure in which one kind of standard cells SC are stacked vertically.",
        "The above-described embodiment is merely an example, and the present invention is not limited to this. For example, the standard cell need not always have an inverter circuit structure and can have an arbitrary circuit structure."
