        "The present invention relates to DS-CDMA (Direct Sequence-Code Divisional Multiple Access) mobile communications, and particularly relates to single carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communications and multi-carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communications.",
        "Multi-carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communications and single carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communications are used as DS-CDMA mobile communications.",
        "When data length to be transmitted is far longer than one packet length in a single carrier/DS-CDMA uplink packet transmission method, an efficient transmission is achieved at the time of call connection by fixedly assigning spreading codes and time slots to be used in communication.",
        "In this case, efficient multiplexing is necessary with respect to reservation demand packets for reserving the allocation of spreading codes and time slots as well as with respect to data packets for transmitting real data. Since the probability of reservation demand packets being able to be transmitted are not controlled in the conventional technique, collision of reservation demand packets occur frequently at the time of heavy traffic, giving rise to a problem that a transmission efficiency decreases.",
        "In \u201cPerformance of orthogonal CDMA codes for quasi-synchronous communication systems\u201d (V. DaSilva, E. Sousa: Proc. of ICUPC' vol. 2, pp995-999, 1993), first study was made about the multi-carrier/DS-CDMA method.",
        "Unlike the single carrier/DS-CDMA, which transmits a CDMA signal on one carrier, the multi-carrier/DS-CDMA divides a radio-transmission bandwidth, and performs parallel transmission of a CDMA signal by two or more subcarriers.",
        "With this provision, the speed of information transmission per subcarrier becomes low, and the speed of code spreading at which information signals are spread to generate CDMA signals also becomes low. Consequently, a chip length of the spreading code can be made longer in the multi-carrier/DS-CDMA than in the single carrier/DS-CDMA. As the chip length is increased, the influence of synchronization errors between spreading codes will be alleviated. Utilizing this feature, the above-mentioned paper applies the multi-carrier/DS-CDMA to communications from mobile stations to base stations in mobile communications systems, and presents a method of performing quasi-synchronous transmission.",
        "Further, a performance evaluation has been conducted on a link level of the multi-carrier/DS-CDMA.",
        "\u201cOn the Perfomance of Multi-carrier DS CDMA Systems\u201d (S. Kondo and L. B. Milstein: IEEE Transactions on Communications, vol.44, no.2, pp.238-246, February 1996) demonstrates that the multi-carrier/DS-CDMA provides better properties than the single carrier/DS-CDMA according to a performance evaluation that is conducted in the presence of narrow-band interference.",
        "However, conventional studies about the multi-carrier/DS-CDMA method have been centered around performance evaluations on the link level, and few studies have been made on how a mobile station should communicate with a base station and how a control signal therefor should be transmitted when this method is applied to a mobile communication system.",
        "Furthermore, these studies have a problem in that they have been based on the circuit switching method which always secures a communication channel of exclusive use from the start of transmission to its end for signal transmission from a transmitter to a receiver as usually used in the conventional mobile communication system.",
        "Moreover, digital mobile communication systems (for example, a PDC system, a GSM system, and the like) are focused onto voice communication services, and the systems are designed on the basis of the circuit switching at present. Further, although a packet transmission service is planned also in the next-generation mobile communication system (for example, IMT-2000), which will be introduced soon, the system design is also based on the circuit switching. Thus, in a radio-transmission system based on the circuit switching, channels for an uplink and a downlink are almost equal in number, and even if a data communication is performed, a symmetrical channel structure of the uplink and the downlink is used. For this reason, transmission of a control command to each user is performed using the channel corresponding to each user.",
        "Conversely, in multimedia mobile communications for which demand is supposed to grow in the future, communications are asymmetrical between the uplink and the downlink. Accordingly, it is conceivable that downlink traffic accounts for most of the traffic when data is downloaded. Also, when data is uploaded, it is conceivable that the uplink traffic accounts for most of the traffic while the downlink is required only for response signals. In such a case, if one channel assigned to each user is used to send each user's control command, the efficiency of data transmission becomes poor.",
        "In recent years, the multi-carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communication system has been attracting attention as a mobile communication system that is capable of high-speed data transmission. This multi-carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communication system has a problem in that no scheme has yet been proposed about a channel structure that takes into account the above-described asymmetry in the amount of data transmission between the uplink and the downlink in high-speed data communications directed to multimedia or the like.",
        "A general object of the present invention is to provide an improved single carrier/DS-CDMA packet transmission method, an uplink packet transmission method in a multi-carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communication system, and a downlink channel structure in a multi-carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communication system, which solve the problems of the conventional technology mentioned above.",
        "The first object of the present invention relative to the single carrier/DS-CDMA packet transmission method and transmission system is to provide-multiplexing of a reservation demand packet and a data packet efficiently, to improve transmission efficiency, and further to realize a flexible bandwidth control of a channel wherein the reservation demand packet and the data packet occupy according to changes in traffic amount.",
        "In order to attain this object, the present invention is structured such that a predetermined time slot of part or all of spreading codes is assigned to reservation demand packet transmission, and the reservation demand packet and data packet are time-multiplexed for transmission, in the single carrier/DS-CDMA packet transmission method which carries out bandwidth expansion of an information symbol by a spreading code sequence, and carries out packet transmission using this spreading code.",
        "Moreover, the single carrier/DS-CDMA packet transmission method which carries out the bandwidth expansion of the information symbol by the spreading code sequence, and carries out the packet transmission using this spreading code is configured such that k pieces of spreading codes, where 0<k<N and N represents the number of all spreading codes, are assigned to the reservation demand packet transmission, and the reservation demand packet and the data packet are code-multiplexed and transmitted,",
        "the reservation demand packet transmission admission probability determined in advance is lowered when a channel occupancy rate of the data packet exceeds a predetermined value,",
        "the number of the spreading codes assigned to the reservation demand packet transmission is decreased and the number of the spreading codes assigned to the data-packet transmission is increased when the channel occupancy rate of the data packet exceeds a predetermined value,",
        "when the channel occupancy rate of the data packet exceeds a predetermined value, the reservation demand packet transmission admission probability determined in advance is first lowered, and if the channel occupancy rate of the data packet still exceeds the predetermined value, even after lowering the reservation demand packet transmission admission probability, then subsequently, the number of the spreading codes assigned to the reservation demand packet transmission is decreased and the number of the spreading codes assigned to the data-packet transmission is increased,",
        "when the channel occupancy rate exceeds the predetermined value, first the number of the spreading codes assigned to the reservation demand packet transmission is decreased, and if the channel occupancy rate still exceeds the predetermined value, even after decreasing the number of the spreading codes assigned to the reservation demand packet transmission, then subsequently, the reservation demand packet transmission admission probability determined in advance is lowered,",
        "the channel occupancy rate of the data packet is measured, and the number of spreading codes available for the reservation demand packet and the reservation demand packet transmission admission probability are determined,",
        "the number of spreading codes available for the reservation demand packet and the transmission admission probability above-mentioned are inserted into an information channel by time-multiplexing,",
        "a short repetition period spreading code (Short code) is used as a code to expand the bandwidth of the reservation demand packet and the data packet, and",
        "as the code to expand the bandwidth of the reservation demand packet, the short repetition period spreading code (Short code) is used, and a long repetition period spreading code (Long code) is used as the code to expand the bandwidth of the data packet.",
        "The second object of the present invention is to provide an uplink packet transmission method for a new multi-carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communication system, which can realize a packet transmission with a variable transmission speed.",
        "In order to attain this object, the present invention relative to an uplink packet transmission method in a multi-carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communication system that has n subcarriers (n being a natural number two or larger) is structured such that frames that are segments for every fixed time are provided to each communication channel of the above-mentioned subcarriers, the frame is divided into time slots with F pieces (F being a natural number, two or larger), and a mobile station transmits a packet to be transmitted to a base station by spreading by a spreading code in synchronous with the timing of the above-mentioned time slot.",
        "Further, the uplink packet transmission method for the multi-carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communication system which has n subcarriers is structured such that:",
        "the above-mentioned mobile station requires an assignment of a time slot and a spreading code by transmitting a reservation demand packet to the above-mentioned base station which assigns a time slot and a spreading code to the demanding mobile station, and the above-mentioned mobile station spreads a packet by spreading the packet by the spreading code and transmits in the time slot assigned by the above-mentioned base station,",
        "the above-mentioned mobile station carries out the packet transmission through a random access to a time slot of one the above-mentioned communication channels without requesting the above-mentioned base station for an assignment of a time slot,",
        "transmission speed of the above-mentioned mobile station is changed according to a transmission volume of the packet which the above-mentioned mobile station transmits,",
        "the above-mentioned base station assigns k1 pieces (k1 being a natural number, and k1<=F\u00d7n) of the time slot for the above-mentioned reservation demand packet transmission, and further assigns m1 pieces (m1 being a natural number, and m1<=total number of available spreading codes) of the spreading codes, and the above-mentioned mobile station transmits the reservation demand packet spread by one of the assigned spreading codes in the assigned time slot,",

        "the above-mentioned base station notifies a transmission limit of a reservation demand packet to the above-mentioned mobile station, when there are numerous reservation demand packets during the predetermined period from the above-mentioned mobile station, the above-mentioned mobile station transmits reservation demand packets, following the limit,",
        "the above-mentioned base station assigns k2 pieces (k2 being a natural number and k2<=F\u00d7n) of the time slot in which packet transmission is possible and an m2 pieces (m2 being a natural number and m2<=total number of available spreading codes) of the spreading code is further assigned for spreading a random access packet, by the above-mentioned mobile station accessing randomly for the above-mentioned mobile station to spread and transmit the random accessing packet by one of the assigned spreading codes in the assigned time slot,",
        "the above-mentioned base station changes the number of the time slots k2 for the above-mentioned random access packet transmission according to the number of packets during the predetermined period from the above-mentioned mobile station which carries out random access,",
        "the above-mentioned base station changes the number of the spreading codes m2 for the above-mentioned random access packet transmission according to the number of packets during the predetermined period from the above-mentioned mobile station which carries out random access,",
        "the above-mentioned base station changes the number of the time slots k2 for the above-mentioned random access packet transmission, and the number of the spreading codes m2 for the above-mentioned random access packet transmission according to the number of packets during the predetermined period from the above-mentioned mobile station which carries out random access,",
        "the above-mentioned base station notifies a transmission limit of a random access packet to the above-mentioned mobile station, when there are numerous packets during the predetermined period from the above-mentioned mobile station which carries out random access, and the above-mentioned mobile station performs random access following the limit,",
        "the above-mentioned base station assigns p (p being a natural number, and p<=the total number of available spreading codes) pieces of spreading codes to the mobile station according to the magnitude of the transmission volume of the above-mentioned mobile station,",
        "the above-mentioned base station assigns a spreading code having a different spreading factor to the above-mentioned mobile station according to the magnitude of the transmission volume of the above-mentioned mobile station, and",
        "the above-mentioned base station performs assignment by changing at least two of the number of spreading codes p (p being a natural number and p<=total number of available spreading codes), spreading codes having different spreading factors, the numbers of time slots q (q being a natural number, and q<=F\u00d7n) according to the magnitude of the transmission volume of the mobile station.",
        "The third object of the present invention is to provide a downlink channel structure that is capable of efficiently transmitting control information to each user in a situation where information transmission volumes are asymmetrical between an uplink and a downlink in a multi-carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communication system.",
        "In order to attain this object, the present invention, relative to the structure of the downlink channel in the multi-carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communication system that transmits spreading codes obtained by expanding bandwidth of information symbols by a spreading code sequence using two or more subcarriers that have a predetermined frequency interval, is structured such that two or more communication channels assigned to each of two or more subcarriers are divided for every predetermined time frame, multiplexed and assigned to each subcarrier, the two or more communication channels being used by a common control channel for two or more users, and a communication channel peculiar to each user.",
        "According to the downlink channel structure in the multi-carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communication system such as above, either or both of user-peculiar information and common information is/are included in the common-control channel of each of the above-mentioned subcarriers and transmitted, when the information is transmitted from a base station to each user (mobile station).",
        "Moreover, from a viewpoint that information used by each user when transmitting information to the base station should be efficiently transmitted to each user, the downlink of the present invention can be structured such that information for controlling transmission of each user's uplink is included in the above-mentioned common-control channel. The information for controlling transmission of each user's uplink can include a transmission power control command to control the transmission power of each user (mobile station), a control command used to control a call origination, and a control command to control, for example, to control frequency, code (including a spreading factor), and time to be used by each user.",

        "A frequency bandwidth to be used is divided into n subcarriers f1-fn (n being a natural number of two or larger). Moreover, these subcarriers f1-fn are used by time-sharing. Therefore, frames are set up to each subcarrier. (A frame is a segment for every fixed time, and a frame length is set to TF. The frames are common to all subcarriers.) Furthermore, the frames are divided into F pieces of time slots in time (F being a natural number of two or larger) TS1-TSF (1 time-slot length TS=TF/F).",
        "Therefore, over all subcarriers, there are F\u00d7n pieces of the time slots in one frame.",
        "A mobile station transmits a packet according to the timing of this time slot. Moreover, within the same time slot, a packet is multiplexed by the principle of the code division (CDMA) by spreading with different spreading codes.",
        "Therefore, by the channel structure of FIG. 15, simultaneous transmission of a plurality of packets, F\u00d7n\u00d7 (the number of multiplex spreading codes) is attained.",
        "In the example of FIG. 15, three packets are multiplexed by CDMA in the time slot TS1 of the subcarrier f1.",
        "FIG. 16 shows an example of an exchange of control performed between a mobile station and a base station when packet transmission is carried out to the base station from the mobile station.",
        "The mobile station first transmits a reservation demand packet to the base station, demanding an assignment of a time slot and a spreading code for transmitting a packet (S101). To the assignment demand from the mobile station, the base station assigns a time slot on a communication channel, and a spreading code (S102), and notifies the result to the mobile station (S103).",
        "The mobile station spreads the packet with the assigned spreading code in the time slot assigned from the base station, and transmits (S104).",
        "Thereby, only the mobile station which was assigned the time slot and the spreading code can transmit by spreading the packet using the assigned spreading code in the assigned time slot.",
        "If a large number of the time slots or a large number of the spreading codes are assigned, a large number of packets can be transmitted simultaneously, making a transmission capacity large.",
        "Moreover, even when one time slot and one spreading code are assigned, the mobile station uses the assigned spreading code and the time slot with priority, enabling a packet transmission in a large transmission volume as a result, if the transmission can be done periodically and reliably until information which the mobile station is to transmit is finished.",
        "FIG. 17 is a drawing showing an example of an exchange of control performed in a mobile station and a base station when packet transmission is carried out to the base station from the mobile station. The mobile station carries out a random access to one of time slots of a communication channel, and transmits a packet (S111).",
        "Here, if it succeeds in transmission of a packet, the packet transmission will be ended (YES at S112). When it fails (NO at S112), the mobile station carries out a random access again to one of the time slots on the communication channel, and transmits the packet (S111).",
        "Thus, the method, wherein the packet transmission of the mobile station is carried out by randomly accessing one of the time slots of the communication channels, without requiring a time slot assignment of the above-mentioned base station, is suitable when carrying out a packet transmission in a small transmission volume from the mobile station to the base station.",
        "FIG. 18 is a drawing showing an example of an exchange of control performed in the mobile station and the base station for changing a transmission speed according to a volume of packet transmissions that the mobile station is to transmit.",
        "When the mobile station transmits a reservation demand packet to the base station and requires an assignment of a time slot and a spreading code first, the volume of the transmission is also communicated (S120).",
        "Based on the information about the assignment demand and the transmission volume from the mobile station, the base station assigns a time slot and a spreading code on a communication channel according to the transmission volume of the mobile station, and notifies the result to the mobile station (S121).",
        "The mobile station transmits packets based on the notified result (S122).",
        "Thereby, it the transmission volume of the packets which the mobile station is to transmit is large, the base station will allocate a time slot that is capable of transmitting the big transmission volume (for example, two or more time slots) and a spreading code (for example, two or more spreading codes, and a spreading code of a small spreading factor), and if the transmission volume which the mobile station needs is small, the base station will allocate a time slot and a spreading code accordingly.",
        "In this manner, the base station assigns a time slot and a spreading code adaptively according to the transmission volume of the mobile station.",
        "As for the mobile station, a transmission speed according to the transmission volume is attained.",
        "Next, a description will follow as to how the base station assigns a time slot and a spreading code for the reservation demand packet transmission, when the mobile station transmits the reservation demand packet to the base station.",
        "From the mobile station to the base station, a simultaneous transmission of a plurality of packets of F\u00d7n\u00d7 (the number of multiplexing of spreading codes) is attained as shown in FIG. 15.",
        "In the present invention, some of these F\u00d7n\u00d7 (the number of spreading multiplexing codes) are used for the reservation demand packet transmission.",

Each channel (a common-control channel and communication channels) in each subcarrier is distinguished by the spreading code sequences (code) used in the common-control channel generation unit 11 and the user channel generation units 12 (#1) through 12 (#m) mentioned above.",
        "The common-control channel includes the information generated in the common-control channel generation unit 11 that may include any one of or any combination of, for example, the pilot symbol (generated by the pilot symbol generation unit 50), the uplink transmission control information (generated by the uplink transmission-control information generation unit 20), the response information to the uplink transmission (generated by the response information generation unit 30), the common broadcast information (the common broadcast information generation unit 40).",
        "Information (transmission data) which should be transmitted to a user is assigned to each communication channel such that the information generated in each of the user channel generation units 12 (#1)-12 (#m) is included in the corresponding communication channel.",
        "In addition, channels of one or a plurality of the subcarriers can be assigned to each user.",
        "In the downlink channel structure mentioned above, a common-control channel of each subcarrier can be arbitrarily set up as to what information is included, and as to whether information is included in the common channel of all the subcarriers.",
        "In the following, another example of the downlink channel structure that is similar to the example shown in FIG. 49 is described, where a common-control channel is assigned to one code channel in each time frame in each of the n subcarriers 1 through n, and communication channels are assigned to a plurality of code channels.",
        "In the example shown in FIG. 50, information other than the pilot symbol (uplink-control information, uplink response broadcast information) is included in the common-control channel of a specific subcarrier (for example, the subcarrier 1). The pilot symbol may be included in the common-control channel of all the subcarriers, or in the common-control channel of discontinuous subcarriers.",
        "In an example shown in FIG. 51, different subcarriers are assigned to common-control channels according to the kind of information to be included. For example, the uplink-control information is included in the common-control channel in the subcarrier 1, the uplink response information is included in the common-control channel in the subcarrier 2, and the broadcast information is included in the common-control channel in the subcarrier n. Like the example shown in FIG. 50, this example also allows the pilot symbol to be included in the common-control channel of all the subcarriers, or in the common-control channel of each discontinuous subcarrier.",
        "In an example shown in FIG. 52, any of or any combination of the above-mentioned pilot symbol, the uplink-control information, the uplink response information and the broadcast information is included in the common-control channel of each subcarrier, not in each whole time frame but in a predetermined time zone T. Consequently, the information included in the common-control channel in each subcarrier is transmitted for every predetermined period to the same timing.",
        "In the example shown in FIG. 53, above-mentioned information is included in the common-control channel in each subcarrier, not in each whole time frame but in some time zones, like the example shown in FIG. 52. In this example, however, the time zones T1, T2 through Tn differ for every subcarrier. Consequently, the information included in the common-control channel in each subcarrier is transmitted for every predetermined period at different timings.",
        "According to the downlink channel structure in the multi-carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communication system, as mentioned above, since various information can be transmitted to each user by including the information in the common-control channel that can be commonly used by all users, efficient transmission is attained compared with the case where the information is transmitted by an individual channel peculiar to a user.",
        "If information (for example, the transmission power control information, the response information to each user, the channel allocation information, and the like) peculiar to each user is further included in the common-control channel, the peculiar information to a plurality of users can be transmitted now by one common-control channel, and efficient information transmission will be attained.",
        "In the third embodiment, in each example mentioned above, although the common-control channel was assigned to one code channel of all subcarriers, the present invention is not limited to this. It is possible to assign a control channel to one, two or more code channels of two or more subcarriers, partly or wholly.",
        "According to the first embodiment of the present invention, efficient multiplexing of a reservation demand packet and a data packet is realized by using a time slot and a spreading code in a single carrier/DS-CDMA uplink packet transmission method. Further by the first embodiment, changes in traffic amount can be flexibly met also by controlling the number of the spreading codes available to a reservation demand packet and the reservation demand packet transmission admission probability.",
        "Moreover, the packet transmission method in the multi-carrier/DS-CDMA of the second embodiment of the present invention realizes time-slot reservation type packet transmission, random access type packet transmission, and packet transmission of a variable transmission speed, enabling efficient transmission of signals of various transmission volumes.",
        "Further, according to the third embodiment of the present invention, any of information peculiar to each user and information common to all users can be included and transmitted by inserting the information into the common-control channel in each above-mentioned subcarrier in a multi-carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communication system when information is transmitted from a base station to each user (mobile station). Therefore, efficient transmission of control information to each user is now available even when there is an asymmetry in transmission information volumes between the uplink and the downlink in a multi-carrier/DS-CDMA mobile communication system."
