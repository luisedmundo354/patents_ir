No. 6,506,087 issued Jan. 14, 2003, the contents all of which are incorporated by reference herein.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing an image forming apparatus having an image forming means and a spacer in an envelope, the spacer maintaining a space in the envelope.",
        "2. Related Background Art",
        "Two types of electron emitting elements are known, a hot cathode element and a cold cathode element. As the cold cathode element, a surface conduction type electron emitting element (hereinafter described as a surface conduction type emitting element), a field emission type electron emitting element (hereinafter described as FE type element), a metal/insulating layer/metal type electron emitting element (hereinafter described as MIM type element) or the like are known.",
        "The surface conduction type emitting element is described, for example, in \u201cRadio Eng. Electron Phys.\u201d by M. I. Elinson, 10, 1290, (1965) and other examples to be later described are known.",
        "The surface conduction type emitting element utilizes the phenomenon that electrons are emitted when current is flowed through a thin film having a small area formed on a substrate in parallel to the film surface. Surface conduction type emitting elements heretofore reported include an element using an SnO2 thin film by Elinson or others, an element using an Au thin film (\u201cThin Solid Films\u201d by G. Dittmer, 9, 317 (1972), an element using an In2O3/SnO2 thin film (\u201cIEEE Trans. ED Conf.\u201d, by M. Hartwell and C. G. Fonstad, 519 (1975)), an element using a carbon thin film (\u201cVacuum\u201d, by Hisashi ARAKI, et. al., Vol. 26, No. 1, 22 (1983)), and the like.",
        "A typical example of the structure of a surface conduction type emitting element proposed by M. Hartwell is shown in the plan view of FIG. 37. In FIG. 37, reference numeral 3001 represents a substrate, and reference numeral 3004 represents a conductive thin film made of sputtered metal oxide. The conductive thin film 3004 is of an H-character shape. The conductive thin film 2004 is subject to an electric energization process called an electric energization forming process to be described later, to thereby form an electron emission area 3005. A distance L is 0.5 to 1 mm, and a width W is 0.1 mm. In FIGS. 27A and 27B, although the electron emission area 3005 is schematically shown as a rectangle at the center of the conductive thin film 3004 for the purpose of simplicity, this does not reflect the actual shape and position of the electron emission area, with high fidelity.",
        "The electron emission area 3005 of the element proposed by M. Hartwell or other elements described above are generally formed by making the conductive thin film 3004 be subject to an electric energization process called an electric energization forming process in order to allow electrons to emit. With the electric energization, a constant d.c. voltage or a d.c. voltage rising at a very slow rate, e.g., at 1 V/min, is applied across opposite ends of the conductive film 3004 to locally destroy, deform or decompose the conductive thin film 3004 and form the electron emission area having an electrically high resistance. Cracks are formed in the conductive thin film 3004 locally destroyed, deformed or decomposed. If a proper voltage is applied to the conductive thin film 3004 after this electric energization, electrons are emitted from an area near the cracks.",
        "As the FE type element, those elements are known which are described, for example, in \u201cField emission\u201d, Advance in Electron Physics, by W. P. Dyke and W. W. Dolan, 8, 89 (1956) or in \u201cPhysical properties of thin-film field emission cathodes with molybdenum cones\u201d, J. Appl. Phys. by C. A. Spindt, 47, 5248 (1976).",
        "A typical example of the structure of an FE type element proposed by C. A. Spindt is shown in the cross sectional view of FIG. 38. In FIG. 38, reference numeral 3010 represents a substrate, reference numeral 3011 represents an emitter layer made of conductive material, reference numeral 3012 represents an emitter cone, reference numeral 3013 represents an insulating layer, and reference numeral 3014 represents a gate electrode 3014. Electrons are emitted from the tip of the emitter cone 3012 of this element through an electric field emission by applying a proper voltage between the emitter cone 3012 and gate electrode 3014.",
        "Instead of the lamination structure shown in FIG. 38, the FE type element having a different structure is also known in which an emitter and a gate electrode are formed on a substrate generally in parallel to the substrate surface.",
        "As an example of the MIM type element, an element described in \u201cOperation of tunnel-emission Devices\u201d, by C. A Mead, J. Appl. Phys., 32, 646 (1961) and other elements are known. A typical example of the structure of an MIM type element is shown in the cross sectional view of FIG. 39. In FIG. 39, reference numeral 3020 represents a substrate, reference numeral 3021 represents a lower electrode made of metal, reference numeral 3022 represents a thin insulating layer of about 100 angstroms in thickness, and reference numeral 3023 represents an upper electrode made of metal and having a thickness of about 80 to 360 angstroms. Electrons are emitted from the surface of the upper electrode 3023 of the MIM type element by applying a proper voltage between the upper electrode 3023 and lower electrode 3021.",
        "The cold cathode elements described above can emit electrons at a temperature lower than the hot cathode element, and does not require a heater. Therefore, the structure is more simple than the hot cathode element and a fine element can be manufactured. Even if a number of elements are formed on a substrate at a high density, a problem of thermal melting of a substrate is not likely to occur. Although a response speed of a hot cathode element is low because of heating the heater, a response speed of a cold cathode element is high.",
        "From the above reasons, applications of cold cathode elements have been studied vigorously.",
        "For example, since a surface conduction type emitting element among cold cathode elements is simple in structure and easy to manufacture, it has the advantage that a number of elements can be formed in a large area. As disclosed in JP-A-64-31332 by the same assignee as the present assignee, a method of driving a number of elements has been studied. As the applications of surface conduction type emitting elements, an image forming apparatus for an image display device, an image recording device, a charge beam source, and the like have been studied.",
        "As the application to an image display apparatus, an image display apparatus utilizing a combination of surface conduction type emitting elements and a fluorescent member which emits light upon application of an electron beam, has been studied as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,066,883, JP-A-2-257551, JP-A-4-28137 by the same assignee as the present assignee. An image display apparatus utilizing a combination of surface conduction type emitting elements and a fluorescent member is expected to have more excellent characteristics than a conventional image display apparatus of other types. For example, as compared to a recently prevailing liquid crystal display apparatus, the image display apparatus of this type does not require back light because of self light emission and has a broad angle of view.",
        "A method of driving a number of FE type elements is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,904,895 by the same assignee as the present assignee. An example of the application of FE type elements to an image display apparatus is a flat panel type display apparatus reported by R. Meyer in \u201cRecent Development on Microtips Display st LETI\u201d, Tech. Digest of 4th int. Vacuum Microelectronics Conf., Nagahama, pp. 6-9 (1991).",
        "An example of the application of a number of MIM type elements to an image-display apparatus is disclosed in JP-A-3-55738 by the same assignee as the present assignee.",
        "Of image forming apparatuses utilizing the above-described electron emitting elements, a flat panel type display apparatus having a thin depth requires less space and is light in weight. Therefore, the flat panel type display apparatus has drawn attention as a substitute for a CRT type display apparatus.",
        "FIG. 40 is a perspective view showing an example of a display panel portion of a flat panel type image display apparatus. A portion of the panel is broken in order to shown the internal structure.",
        "In FIG. 40, reference numeral 3115 represents a rear plate, reference numeral 3116 represents a side wall, and reference numeral 3117 represents a face plate. The rear plate 3115, side wall 3116 and face plate 3117 constitute an envelope (air-tight envelope) which maintains the inside of the display panel vacuum.",
        "A substrate 3111 is fixed to the rear plate 3115. N\u00d7M cold cathode elements 3112 are formed on the substrate. N and M are positive integers of 2 or larger and are properly set in accordance with a target number of display pixels. The N\u00d7M cold cathode elements 3112 are wired as shown in FIG. 40 by M row direction wiring lines 3113 and N column direction wiring lines 3114. A structure made of the substrate 3111, cold cathode elements 3112, row direction wiring lines 3113, and column direction wiring lines 3114 is called a multi electron beam source. At each cross area of the row direction wiring line 3113 and column direction wiring line 3114, an insulating layer (not shown) is formed between the lines to provide electrical insulation.",
        "A fluorescent film 3118 made of fluorescent material is formed on the bottom surface of the face place 3117. The fluorescent materials of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) colors of three primary colors are divisionally coated to form the fluorescent film 3118. Black color material (not shown) is coated between the color fluorescent materials of the fluorescent film 3118. A metal back 3119 made of Al or the like is formed on the fluorescent film 3110 on the side of the rear plate 3115.",
        "Dx1 to Dxm, Dy1 to Dyn, and Hv are electrical connection terminals of an air-tight structure for electrically connecting the display panel to an unrepresented electric circuit. Dx1 to Dxm are electrically connected to the row direction wiring lines 3113 of the multi electron beam source, Dy1 to Dyn are electrically connected to the column direction wiring lines 3114 of the multi electron beam source, and Hv is electrically connected to the metal back 3119.",
        "The inside of the air-tight envelope is maintained at a vacuum of about 10\u22126 Torr. As the display area of the image display apparatus becomes large, a pressure difference between the inside of the air-tight envelope and the outside thereof becomes large. It is therefore necessary to provide means for preventing the rear plate 3115 and face plate 3117 from being deformed or destroyed. If the rear plate 3115 and face plate 3117 are made thick, not only the weight of the image display apparatus increases, but also an image distortion increases when viewed obliquely and a parallax may occur. In the example shown in FIG. 40, structural support members (called a spacer or rib) 3120 made of relatively thin glass plates are mounted in order to be resistant to the atmospheric pressure.",
        "The distance between the substrate 3111 with the multi electron beam source and the face plate 3117 with the fluorescent film 3118 is maintained usually sub-mm or several mm, and the inside of the air-tight envelope is maintained highly vacuum as described earlier.",
        "As a voltage is applied to each cold cathode element 3112 via the terminals Ds1 to Dxm and Dy1 to Dyn of the image display apparatus using the above-described display panel, electrons are emitted from each cold cathode element 3112. At the same time, a high voltage of several hundreds V to several kV is applied via the terminal Hv to the metal back 3119 to accelerate the emitted electrons and make them collide with the inner surface of the face plate 3117. The fluorescent materials of each color constituting the fluorescent film 3118 emit light and an image can be displayed.",
        "A spacer having a space maintaining function sufficient for maintaining the space in the air-tight envelope of the image display apparatus described above has been desired, and also a method of efficiently forming the spacer has been desired.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing an image forming apparatus provided with spacers having an improved space maintaining function.",
        "It is another object of the invention to provide a method of manufacturing an image forming apparatus using electron emitting elements capable of further reducing a displacement of an electron trajectory to be caused by a spacer.",
        "It is a further object of the invention to provide a method of manufacturing an image forming apparatus capable of forming spacers with improved work efficiency and manufacture yield.",
        "It is another object of the invention to provide an image forming apparatus capable of displaying a high quality image.",
        "In order to achieve the above objects of the invention, a method of manufacturing an image forming apparatus having an envelope made of members inclusive of a first substrate and a second substrate disposed at a space being set therebetween, image forming means and spacers disposed in the envelope, the spacers maintaining the space, is provided. The method comprises the steps of: forming a spacer having a desired shape by cutting a spacer base member; and abutting the spacer upon the first substrate or second substrate at non-cut surface of the spacer.",

        "The invention provides a method of manufacturing an image forming apparatus having an envelope made of members inclusive of a first substrate and a second substrate disposed at a space being set therebetween, and image forming means disposed in the envelope, the method comprising the steps of: forming spacers to be disposed in the envelope to maintain the space and disposing the spacers in the envelope. The spacer of this invention may be either an insulating spacer or a conductive spacer.",
        "The image forming apparatus of this invention may include a liquid crystal display panel, a plasma display panel, an electron beam display panel and the like. These image forming apparatus each have in its envelope the image forming means and the spacers for maintaining the space in the envelope.",
        "For example, the image forming means of an electron beam display panel may include electron emitting elements and an image forming member for forming image when electrons are applied from the electron emitting elements. The image forming member may include an acceleration electrode for accelerating electrons and a fluorescent member which emits light when electrons are applied.",
        "The envelope of an electron beam display panel may be made of first and second substrates disposed at the space being set therebetween, the first substrate being formed with electron emitting elements and the second substrate being formed with the image forming member.",
        "According to a first aspect of a method of manufacturing an image forming apparatus of this invention, first a spacer base member larger than each spacer to be disposed in the envelope is cut to form a spacer having a desired shape, and then these spacers are disposed in the envelope in such a manner that the cut surface of the base spacer member is not abutted upon the first or second substrate but the non-cut surface of the spacer is abutted upon the first or second substrate. The cut surface of the spacer base member is likely to form cracks and broken pieces. Therefore, it is effective from the viewpoint of the space maintaining function that the non-cut surface is used as an abut surface rather than that the cut surface is used as an abut surface. It is preferable from the viewpoint of work efficiency that a plurality of spacers having a desired shape be formed from one spacer base member.",
        "According to a second aspect of the method of manufacturing an image forming apparatus of this invention, first, similar to the first aspect, a spacer base member larger than each spacer to be disposed in the envelope is cut to form a spacer having a desired shape. In this case, in the second aspect, a groove is formed in advance at the cut position of the spacer base member, and the spacer base member is cut along this groove to form the spacer having the desired shape. This groove may be formed intermittently or continuously along the cut position. It is however preferable as will be later described that the groove is formed continuously in order to reduce cracks and broken pieces on the cut surface as many as possible. Next, in the second aspect, the spacer is disposed in the envelope in such a manner that the cut surface of the spacer base member is abutted on the first or second substrate. Since the groove is formed in advance in the spacer base member and this member is cut along the groove, cracks and broken pieces at the cut surface can be reduced as many as possible. It is therefore more effective from the viewpoint of the space maintaining function that the cut surface with the groove is used as an abut surface rather than that the cut surface without the groove is used as an abut surface. Also in this aspect, it is preferable from the viewpoint of work efficiency that a plurality of spacers having a desired shape be formed from one spacer base member. Further in this aspect, it is more effective, from the viewpoint of that cracks and broken pieces at the cut surface can be reduced as many as possible, that the groove is formed on both surfaces of the spacer base member along the cut position if the spacer base member is of a plate shape.",
        "The spacer to be disposed in the envelope of the image forming apparatus of this invention may be formed with a conductive film on the surface thereof as will be described in the following.",
        "As shown in FIG. 36A, a conductive film 206 is formed on opposite end portions of a spacer 203 near at the abut portions of the spacer 203 upon first and second substrates 201 and 202 constituting the envelope. The conductive film 206 may be formed on the end portion of the spacer 203 on the side of either the first substrate 201 or second substrate 202.",
        "The conductive film 206 defines the potential at the end portion of the spacer 203 and applied with a predetermined potential. For example, the conductive film 206 on the side of the first substrate 201 is electrically connected to a wiring electrode of the electron emitting elements on the first substrate, whereas the conductive film 206 on the side of the second substrate 202 is electrically connected to the acceleration electrode on the second substrate 202. The conductive films disposed on the opposite end portions of the spacer can therefore stabilize the trajectory of electrons emitted from the electron emitting element.",
        "As shown in FIG. 36B, a conductive film 207 is formed on the surface of a spacer 204. This conductive film 207 is preferably a relatively high resistance film as will be described later.",
        "This conductive film 207 is electrically connected to a conductor on a first substrate 201 and to a conductor on a second substrate 202. For example; the conductive film 207 on the side of the first substrate 201 is electrically connected to the electron emitting elements on the first substrate 201, whereas the conductive film 207 on the side of the second substrate 202 is electrically connected to the acceleration electrode on the second substrate 202. The conductive film 207 therefore allows the surface of the spacer 204 to flow a small current to thereby remove charges accumulated on the spacer surface.",
        "As shown in FIG. 36C, a conductive film 207 is formed on the surface of a spacer 205 and another conductive film 206 is formed on the opposite end portions of the spacer 205. The conductive film 206 has the function similar to that of the conductive film shown in FIG. 36A, and the conductive film 207 has the function similar to that of the conductive film shown in FIG. 36B and has a resistance higher than that of the conductive film 206.",
        "The spacer shown in FIG. 36C has the advantages that charges accumulated on the spacer surface are removed and that the trajectory of electrons emitted from the electron emitting element can be stabilized.",
        "The following methods of the invention are used when a spacer with a conductive film formed thereon is disposed in the envelope.",
        "According to a third aspect of the method of manufacturing an image forming apparatus of this invention, first, a conductive film is formed on the surfaces of a spacer base member larger than each spacer to be disposed in the envelope. Thereafter, the spacer base member with the conductive film is cut to form a spacer having a desired shape. The work efficiency can therefore be improved more than the case wherein the conductive film is formed after the spacer base member is cut. Next, the spacer is disposed in the envelope in such a manner that the cut surface of the spacer base member is not abutted on the first or second substrate but the non-cut surface of the spacer is abutted on the first or second substrate. As described earlier, this is because of an effectiveness from the viewpoint of the space maintaining function. Furthermore, since the conductive film is likely to be peeled off from the spacer base member, the electrical connection of the conductive film can be improved if the non-cut surface of the spacer is abutted on the first or second substrate rather than the cut surface of the spacer base member is abutted on the first or second substrate. It is more preferable from the viewpoint of work efficiency that a plurality of spacers having a desired shape be formed from one spacer base member.",
        "According to a fourth aspect of the method of manufacturing an image forming apparatus of this invention, first, similar to the second aspect, a groove is formed in advance at the cut position of a spacer base member larger than each spacer to be disposed in the envelope. In this aspect, the conductive film is formed at least on this groove. Thereafter, the spacer base member is cut along the groove to form a spacer having a desired shape. This groove may be formed intermittently or continuously along the cut position. It is however preferable as will be later described that the groove is formed continuously in order to reduce cracks and broken pieces on the cut surface as many as possible and suppress peel-off of the conductive film as much as possible. It is more preferable from the viewpoint of work efficiency that a plurality of spacers having a desired shape be formed from one spacer base member. Next, the spacer is disposed in the envelope in such a manner that the cut surface of the spacer base member is abutted on the first or second substrate. The groove is formed in advance in the spacer base member and the conductive film is formed at least on this groove, and thereafter, the spacer base member is cut along the groove. Therefore, cracks and broken pieces at the cut surface can be reduced as many as possible and peel-off of the conductive film can be suppressed as much as possible. It is therefore more effective from the viewpoint of the space maintaining function and the electrical connection of the conductive film that the cut surface with the groove is used as an abut surface rather than that the cut surface without the groove is used as an abut surface. Also in this aspect, it is preferable from the viewpoint of work efficiency that a plurality of spacers having a desired shape be formed from one spacer base member. Further in this aspect, it is more effective, from the viewpoint of that cracks and broken pieces at the cut surface can be reduced as many as possible and that peel-off of the conductive film can be suppressed as much as possible, that the groove is formed on both surfaces of the spacer base member along the cut position if the spacer base member is of a plate shape.",
        "Also in this aspect, the groove is preferably formed to have a tapered shape. If the groove has the tapered shape, the contact area between the conductive film and the conductor on the substrate becomes large by a pressure imparted when the space is abutted upon the substrate. Therefore, the electrical connection can be improved. This tapered shape is particularly effective if an abut member itself of the spacer is made of flexible material at least at a producing step or if the spacer is abutted via flexible conductive member such as conductive adhesive at least at the producing step.",
        "Of the first to fourth aspects described above, particularly the first and third aspects of the invention are preferable from the viewpoint of the space maintaining function, electrical connection and work efficiency, because the cut surface of the spacer is not abutted upon the substrate but the non-cut surface of the spacer is abutted upon the substrate.",
        "The image forming apparatus and its manufacture method will be described more specifically in the following with reference to preferred embodiments.",

        "In FIG. 19, reference numeral 1015 represents a rear plate, reference numeral 1016 represents a side wall, and reference numeral 1017 represents a face plate. The rear plate 1015, side wall 1016 and face plate 1017 constitute an air-tight envelope which maintains the inside of the display panel vacuum. In assembling the display panel, a connection area between respective components is required to be hermetically adhered in order to provide the connection area with sufficient strength and air-tightness. Such hermetical adhesion was achieved by coating the connection area with, for example, frit glass, and baking the glass in the atmospheric air or in a nitrogen atmosphere for 10 minutes or longer at 400 to 500\u00b0 C. A method of evacuating the inside of the air-tight envelope will be later described. The inside of the air-tight envelope is maintained at a vacuum of about 10\u22126 Torr. In order to prevent the air-tight envelope from being destroyed by the atmospheric pressed or unexpected impacts, spacers 1020 are used as an atmospheric pressure resistant structure.",

        "In this embodiment, although the substrate 1011 of the multi electron beam source is fixed to the rear plate 1015 of the air-tight envelope, if the substrate 1011 of the multi electron beam source has a sufficient strength, the substrate 1011 itself of the multi electron beam source may be used directly as the rear plate of the air[tight envelope.",
        "A fluorescent film 1018 made of fluorescent material is formed on the bottom surface of the face place 1017. Since the apparatus of the embodiment is a color display apparatus, the fluorescent materials of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) colors of three primary colors are divisionally coated to form the fluorescent film 1018. The fluorescent material of each color is coated, for example, in stripe shapes such as shown in FIG. 22A, and black color conductive material 1010 is coated between fluorescent material stripes. An object of the black color conductive material 1010 is to prevent a display color shift even if there is some displacement of a radiation position of an electron beam, to prevent external light reflection to thereby avoid a lower display contrast, to prevent charge-up of the fluorescent film to be caused by electron beams, and for other purposes. Although the black color conductive material 1010 has black lead as its main composition, other materials may also be used if the above-described objects can be achieved.",

The metal back 1019 was formed by forming the fluorescent film 1018 on the face plate substrate 1017, thereafter planarizing the surface of the fluorescent film 1018, and vacuum depositing Al on the surface of the fluorescent film 1018. If the fluorescent film 1018 is made of low voltage fluorescent materials, the metal back 1019 may not be used.",
        "Although not used in this embodiment, a transparent electrode made of, for example, ITO, may be formed between the face plate substrate 1017 and fluorescent film 1018 in order to apply an acceleration voltage or improve the conductivity of the fluorescent film.",
        "FIG. 23 is a schematic cross sectional view taken along line 23-23 of FIG. 19. In FIG. 23, reference numerals correspond to those used in FIG. 19. A spacer 1020 is a spacer formed by the method of the third embodiment to be described later. The spacer 1020 is made of an insulating member 1, a first conductive film (hereinafter called a high resistance film) 11 and a second conductive film (hereinafter called a low resistance film or an intermediate layer) 21. The high resistance film 11 is formed on the surface of the insulating member 1 in order to prevent charge accumulation. The low resistance film 21 has a resistance lower than the high resistance film 11. The row resistance film 21 is formed on abut surfaces 3 on the inner side (such as metal back 1019) of the face plate 1017 and the surface (such as row or column direction wiring lead 1013 or 1014) of a substrate 1011 and on the upper and lower side surface 5 of the high resistance film 11. Spacers are disposed as many as necessary for achieving the objects of spacer at a necessary pitch. Each spacer is fixed by adhesion members 1041 between the inside of the face plate and the surface of the substrate 1011. The high resistance film 11 is electrically connected to the inner side (such as metal back 1019) of the face plate 1017 and the surface (such as row or column direction wiring lead 1013 or 1014) of the substrate 1011 via the low resistance film 21 and connection member 1041. In this embodiment, the spacer 1020 is of a thin plate shape, and is disposed in parallel to the row direction wiring line 1013 and electrically connected to the wiring line 1013.",
        "The spacer 1020 is required to provide an insulation resistant to a high voltage applied between the row and column direction wiring leads 1013 and 1014 on the substrate 1011 and the metal back 1019 on the bottom surface of the face plate 1017, and also to provide a conductivity capable of preventing charge accumulation on the surface of the spacer 1020.",
        "The insulating member 1 of the spacer 1020 may be made of quartz glass, glass having a reduced amount of impurities such as Na, soda-lime glass, ceramic such as alumina. The insulating member 1 preferably has a thermal expansion coefficient nearly equal to that of the air-tight envelope and substrate 1011.",
        "Current flows in the high resistance film 11 of the spacer 1020, the current having a value of an acceleration voltage Va applied to the high potential side face plate 1017 (such as metal back 1019) divided by the resistance value Rs of the high resistance film 21 serving as a charge prevention film. The resistance value Rs of the spacer is therefore set to a proper value from the standpoint of charge prevention and consumption power. From the standpoint of charge prevention, the surface resistance R/\u25a1 is preferably set to 1012 \u03a9 or smaller. In order to achieve the sufficient charge prevention effect, the surface resistance of 1011 \u03a9 or smaller is more preferable. Although the lower limit of the surface resistance is dependent upon the spacer shape and a voltage applied across the spacer, it is preferably set to 105 \u03a9 or larger.",
        "The thickness t of the charge prevention film formed on the insulating member 1 is preferably set in a range from 10 nm to 1 \u03bcm. A thin film of 10 nm or thinner is generally formed in an island shape and the resistance thereof is unstable and the reproductivity thereof is poor, although they depend on a surface energy of the material, tight contactness to the substrate, and a substrate temperature. If the film thickness is 1 \u03bcm or thicker, a film stress becomes large, a possibility of film peel-off becomes high, and the film forming time becomes long which results in poor productivity. It is therefore preferable to set the film thickness to 50 to 500 nm. The surface resistance R/\u25a1 is \u03c1/t. From the preferable range of R/\u25a1 and t described above, the specific resistance \u03c1 is preferably set to 0.1 \u03a9cm to 108 \u03a9cm. In order to realize a more preferable range of the surface resistance and film thickness, the specific resistance \u03c1 is more preferably set to 102 \u03a9cm to 106 \u03a9cm.",
        "The temperature of the spacer rises while current flows in the charge prevention film or while the display apparatus generates heat during its operation. If the resistance temperature coefficient of the charge prevention film is negative, the resistance value lowers as the temperature rises so that the current flowing in the spacer increases to further raise the temperature. The current increases until it exceeds the limit value. The resistance temperature coefficient allowing such current runaway has empirically a negative value whose absolute value is 1% or higher. It is therefore desired that the resistance temperature coefficient of the charge prevention film is smaller than \u22121%.",
        "The material of the high resistance film 11 having the charge prevention performance may be metal oxide. Of the metal oxide, oxide of chrome, nickel or copper is preferable. The reason for this is that these oxides have a relatively small secondary electron emission efficiency and even if electrons emitted from the cold cathode element 1012 collide with the spacer 1020, the spacer is hard to be charged. In addition to the metal oxide, carbon is a preferable material because of its small secondary electron emission efficiency. Amorphous carbon in particular has a high resistance value so that the resistance of the spacer is easy to be controlled to be set to a desired value.",
        "Other preferable materials of the high resistance film 11 having the charge prevention performance are nitride of aluminum and transition metal because a broad range of the resistance value from good conductor to insulator can be controlled by adjusting the component of transition metal. Other materials to be later described with reference to a process of manufacturing a display apparatus are also preferable because these materials have a small resistance change and are stable and also the resistance temperature coefficient is less than \u22121% and the materials can be used easily in practice. Such transition material may be Ti, Cr, Ta or the like.",
        "A nitride film is deposited on the insulating member by thin film forming methods such as sputtering, reactive sputtering in a nitrogen atmosphere, electron beam vapor deposition, ion plating, and ion assist vapor deposition. A metal oxide film may be formed by similar thin film forming methods. In this case, oxygen gas is used in place of nitrogen gas. The metal oxide film may be formed by CVD or alkoxide coating. A carbon film may be formed by vapor deposition, sputtering, CVD, or plasma CVD. If amorphous carbon is formed, an atmosphere containing hydrogen is used and hydrocarbon gas is used as a source gas.",
        "The low resistance films 21 of the spacer 1020 are provided in order to electrically connect the high resistance film 11 to the high potential side face plate (such as metal back 1019) and to the low potential side substrate 1011 (such as wiring lead 1013, 1014). The low resistance film 21 is also called an intermediate electrode layer (intermediate layer) where applicable in the following description. The intermediate electrode layer (intermediate layer) provides a plurality of functions described in the following.",
        "(1) The Intermediate Films Electrically Connect the High Resistance Film 11 to the Face Plate 1017 and Substrate 1011.",
        "As already described, the high resistance film is provided in order to prevent the surface of the spacer 1020 from being charged. If the high resistance film 11 is connected directly or via the connection members 1041 to the face plate (such as metal back 1019) and substrate 1011 (such as wiring lead 1013, 1014), a connection interface has a large contact resistance and charges accumulated on the spacer surface may become difficult to be removed quickly. In order to avoid this, the abut surface 3 and side surfaces 5 of the spacer 1020 in contact with the face plate 1017, substrate 1011 and connection members 1041 are formed with the low resistance intermediate layers.",
        "(2) The Intermediate Films make Uniform a Potential Distribution of the High Resistance Film 11.",
        "Electrons emitted from the cold cathode element 1012 form an electron trajectory which matches the potential distribution formed between the face plate 1017 and substrate 1011. In order to prevent the electron trajectory from being disturbed near at the spacer 1020, it is necessary to control the potential distribution of the high resistance film 11 in the whole area thereof. If the high resistance film 11 is connected directly or via the connection members 1041 to the face plate (such as metal back 1019) and substrate 1011 (such as wiring lead 1013, 1014), the potential distribution is disturbed by the contact resistances at the connection interfaces so that the potential distribution of the high resistance film 11 may be displaced from the desired pattern. In order to avoid this, the spacer end portions (abut surface 3 and side surfaces 5) in contact with the face plate 1017, substrate 1011 and connection members 1041 are formed with the low resistance intermediate layers, and a desired potential is applied to the intermediate layers to thereby control the potential distribution of the whole of the high resistance film 11.",
        "(3) The Intermediate Films Control the Trajectory of an Emitted Electron Beam.",
        "Electrons emitted from the cold cathode element 1012 form an electron trajectory matching the potential distribution formed between the face plate 1017 and substrate 1011. Electrons emitted from the cold cathode element near at the spacer may limit the mount position of the spacer and so the positions of wiring lead and element may be required to be changed. In such a case, it is necessary to control the trajectory of emitted electrons and apply electrons to a desired position of the face plate 1017 in order to form an image without distortion and disturbance. By forming the low resistance intermediate layers on the upper and lower side surfaces 5 of the spacer in contact with the face plate 1017 and substrate 1011, it is possible to have a desired potential distribution near the spacer 1020 and control the trajectory of emitted electrons.",
        "The low resistance film 21 is set to have a resistance value sufficiently lower than that of the high resistance film 11. For example, 105 \u03a9cm or lower is preferable, and 103 \u03a9cm or smaller is more preferable. It is also preferable that the specific resistance is lower than by one digit than that of the high resistance film, or more preferably by two digits or larger. The material of the low resistance film 21 may be: metal such as Ni, Cr, Au, Mo, W, Pt, Ti, Al, Cu and Pd; alloy thereof; printed conductor constituted of glass and metal or metal oxide such as Pd, Ag, Au, RuO2 and Pd\u2014Ag; transparent conductor such as In2O3\u2014SnO2; and semiconductor material such as poly-silicon.",
        "The connection member 1040 is preferably conductive in order to electrically connect the spacer 1020 to the row direction wiring lead 1013 and metal back 1019. The material is preferably conductive adhesive, metal particles, frit glass added with conductive filler.",
        "Dx1 to Dxm, Dy1 to Dyn, and Hv are electrical connection terminals of an air-tight structure for electrically connecting the display panel to an unrepresented electric circuit. Dx1 to Dxm are electrically connected to the row direction wiring lines 1013 of the multi electron beam source, Dy1 to Dyn are electrically connected to the column direction wiring lines 1014 of the multi electron beam source, and Hv is electrically connected to the metal back 1019 of the face plate.",
        "The inside of the air-tight envelope is evacuated to a vacuum degree of about 10\u22127 Torr, by using unrepresented exhaust pipe and vacuum pump after the air-tight envelope is assembled. Thereafter, the exhaust pipe is sealed. In order to maintain the vacuum degree of the air-tight envelope, a getter film (not shown) is formed at a predetermined position of the inside of the air-tight envelope immediately before or after the exhaust pipe is sealed. The getter film is formed by heating getter material having Ba as its main component with a heater or through high frequency heating to vapor deposit it. The absorption function of the getter film maintains the inside of the air-tight envelope at a vacuum degree of 1\u00d710\u22125 to 1\u00d710\u22127 Torr.",
        "As a voltage is applied to each cold cathode element 3112 via the terminals Ds1 to Dxm and Dy1 to Dyn of the image display apparatus using the above-described display panel, electrons are emitted from each cold cathode element 1012. At the same time, a high voltage of several hundred V to several Kv is applied via the terminal Hv to the metal back 1019 to accelerate the emitted electrons and make them collide with the inner surface of the face plate 1017. The fluorescent materials of each color constituting the fluorescent film 1018 emit light and an image can be displayed.",
        "If a surface conduction type emitting element is used as the cold cathode element 1012, generally a voltage to be applied to the surface conduction type emitting element is about 12 to 16 V, a distance d between the metal back 1019 and cold cathode element 1012 is about 0.1 to 8 mm, and a voltage to be applied across the metal back 1019 and cold cathode element 1012 is about 0.1 Kv to 10 Kv.",

        "Next, a method of manufacturing a multi electron beam source used by the embodiment display panel will be described. The material and shape of each cold cathode element and its manufacture method are not limited so long as the multi electron beam source to be used by the image display apparatus is an electron beam source wired by a simple matrix form. Therefore, other cold cathode elements such as surface conduction type emitting elements, FE type elements and MIM type elements may also be used.",
        "Of these cold cathode elements, a surface conduction type emitting element is particularly suitable because the current situation requests for a display apparatus having a large display screen and being inexpensive. More specifically, the electron emission characteristics of an FE type element are greatly influenced by the relative position and shapes of the emitter cone and gate electrode. Therefore, manufacture techniques with very high precision are necessary, which is disadvantageous factors in realizing a large display screen and a manufacture cost reduction. An MIM type element is required to form thin and uniform insulating film and upper electrode, which is disadvantageous factors in realizing a large display screen and a manufacture cost reduction. In contrast, the surface conduction type emitting element requires a relatively simple manufacture method and is easy to realize a large display screen and a manufacture cost reduction. The present inventors have found that a surface conduction type emitting element having an electron emission area or its peripheral area made of a fine particle film has excellent electron emission characteristics and is easy to manufacture. Surface conduction type emitting elements are therefore most suitable for use as the multi electron beam source of an image display apparatus having a high luminance and a large display screen. The display panel of the embodiment uses surface conduction type emitting elements whose electron emission area and its nearby area are made of a fine particle film. The preferred fundamental structure and manufacture method of a surface conduction type emitting element will be first described and then the structure of a multi electron beam source having a number of elements wired in a simple matrix form will be described.",

Light emission spots, including those formed by emission electrons from the cold cathode element 1012 near the spacer 1020, were formed at a two-dimensionally equal pitch, and an image with clear and good color reproductivity was able to be formed. This means that the intermediate layers 13 of the spacer 1020 were electrically connected in a good state to the metal bask 1019 and wiring electrodes 1013 so that even if the spacers 1020 were disposed as in this embodiment, disturbance of an electric field which affects the electron trajectory was not formed.",
        "In this embodiment, high resistance films and intermediate layers can be formed by using a large base material before it is cut into each spacer. Therefore, manufacture setting work efficiency was improved, a spacer forming time was shortened, and manufacture yield was improved.",

An end portion of the spacer is immersed in this solution to transfer the solution to the spacer base member. After this transfer, the spacer base material is heated to form the intermediate layer. Not only in this embodiment, but also in other embodiments, such an intermediate layer forming method is effective in that the intermediate layer is hard to be peeled off at the boundary between the bottom and side surface of the spacer base member, i.e., at the edge of the spacer base member.",

While, without being limited the above embodiment, another method for forming the intermediate layer by means of a combination of the transfer and the heating/drawing may be further advantageous method in the following reason, that is, in general, the base member produced by the heating/drawing has edge sections with curved surface at upper and lower contact sections of the spacer due to the heating process. Accordingly, in case of using the above transfer in forming the intermediate layer, since the transfer liquid is transferred uniformly to the base member desirably rather than the base member of which sectional shape has a right angled corner, the intermediate layer can be formed more precisely. Also, simultaneously, the spacer can be supplied in a good yielding ratio.",

        "The image memory interface circuit 2108 is a circuit for fetching an image signal stored in a device storing still image data such as a so-called still image disk. The fetched image signal is supplied to the decoder 2104.",
        "The input/output interface circuit 2105 is a circuit for connecting the display apparatus to an external computer, a computer network, or an output device such as a printer. The input/output interface circuit 2105 usually transfers image data and character/graphics data, and in some cases transfers control signals and numerical data between CPU 2106 of the display apparatus and an external circuit.",
        "The image producing circuit 2107 generates display image data in accordance with image data and character/graphics data externally input from the input/output interface circuit 2105 and image data and character/graphics data output from CPU 2106. This image producing circuit 2207 is assembled with circuits necessary for image production, such as a rewritable memory for storing image data and character/graphics data, a ROM for storing image patterns corresponding to character codes, and a processor for image processing.",

        "CPU 2106 mainly performs an operation control of the display apparatus, generation, selection and edition of display images.",
        "For example, CPU 2106 outputs a control signal to the multiplexer 2103 to select or combine image signals to be displayed on the display panel. In this case, CPU 22105 supplies a control signal to the display panel controller 2102 in accordance with an image signal to be displayed, to thereby control the operation of the display panel regarding a screen display frequency, a scan method (such as interlace or non-interlace), and the number of scan lines of one field.",
        "CPU 2106 also controls to directly output image data and character/graphics data to the image producing circuit 2107, and to access via the input/output interface circuit 2105 to fetch image data and character/graphics data. CPU 210 may also help other tasks. For example, CPU 210 may directly operate to use the function of generating and processing data, similar to a personal computer and a word processor.",
        "Alternatively, CPU 210 may connect an external computer network via the input/output interface circuit 2105 to perform a task, for example, arithmetic calculation, together with an external apparatus.",
        "The input section 2114 is used for an operator to enter a command, a program, or data to CPU 2106. The input section 2114 may use various input devices such as a keyboard, a mouse, a joy stick, a bar code reader, and a voice recognition device.",
        "The decoder 2104 decodes various image signals input from the circuits 2107 to 2113 into three primary colors, or a combination of a luminance signal, an I signal and a Q signal. It is preferable that the decoder 2104 has therein an image memory indicated by a broken line in FIG. 35. This is because it is necessary to process TV signals such as MUSE signals which require an image memory when these signals are decoded. In addition, provision of the image memory facilitates a display of a still image. Alternatively, it becomes easy to perform image processing such as image thinning, interpolation, enlargement, reduction, and synthesis, in addition to image edition, in cooperation with the image production circuit 2107 and CPU 2106.",
        "The multiplexer 2103 selects desired images in accordance with a control signal supplied from CPU 2106. Namely, the multiplexer 2103 selects desired image signals from the decoded image signals input from the decoder 2104 and outputs the selected image signals to the drive circuit 2101. In this case, if selected image signals are changed during one frame display times different images can be displayed in divided areas of the screen, similar to a so-called multi screen television.",
        "The display panel controller 2101 controls the operation of the drive circuit 2101 in accordance with a control signal supplied from CPU 2106.",
        "The display panel controller 2101 also supplies the drive circuit 2101 with a signal for controlling the fundamental operation of the display panel, for example, the operation sequence of a drive power source (not shown) of the display panel.",
        "The display panel controller 2101 also supplies the drive circuit 2101 with a signal for controlling the drive operation of the display panel, for example, a screen display frequency and a scan method (interlace or non-interlace).",
        "In some cases, the display panel controller 2101 also supplies the drive circuit 2101 with a signal for controlling the image quality, for example, a display image luminance and contrast, color tone, and sharpness.",
        "The drive circuit 2101 generates a drive signal to be applied to the display panel 2100, and operates in accordance with the image signal input from the multiplexer 2103 and a control signal input from the display panel controller 2102.",
        "The function of each component has been described above. With the display apparatus constructed as shown in FIG. 35, image information input from various image information sources can be displayed on the display panel 2100.",
        "More specifically, after various image signals including television signals are decoded by the decoder 2104, desired image signals are selected by the multiplexer 2103 and input to the drive circuit 2101. In the meantime, the display controller 2102 generates a control signal for controlling the operation of the drive circuit 2101, in accordance with the image signals to be displayed. The drive circuit 2101 applies drive signals to the display panel in accordance with the image signals and control signal.",
        "In this manner, an image is displayed on the display panel. A series of these operations is controlled collectively by CPU 2106.",
        "With a cooperative operation by the image memory in the decoder 2104, image producing circuit 2107 and CPU 2100, the display apparatus can display image information selected from a plurality piece of image information, and also perform other operations such as image processing and image editing. The image processing includes image enlargement, reduction, rotation, motion, edge emphasis, thinning, interpolation, color conversion and image aspect conversion. The image editing includes image synthesis, erase, coupling, replacement and superposition. Although not particularly described in this embodiment, a dedicated circuit for audio processing and editing may be used similar to image processing and editing.",

The application range of this display apparatus is very broad covering both industrial and commercial application fields.",
        "FIG. 35 shows only illustratively an example of the structure of the display apparatus using a display panel with an electron beam source made of surface conduction type emitting elements. Obviously, the invention is not limited only thereto. For example, of the constituent elements shown in FIG. 35, circuits providing the functions not necessary for the specific application field may be omitted. Conversely, constituent elements may be added in accordance with a specific application field. For example, if this display apparatus is to be used as a video telephone, proper constituent elements are added, such as a television camera, a microphone, an illuminator, a transceiver including a modem.",
        "The display panel of this display apparatus, particularly the display panel using surface conduction type emitting elements as an electron beam source, can be made compact and thin. Therefore, the depth of the display apparatus can be made shallow. Moreover, the display panel using surface conduction type emitting elements is easy to have a large screen area, a high luminance, and excellent characteristics of field of view. It is therefore possible for the display apparatus to display an image rich in scene appearance and excitements with good visualization.",
