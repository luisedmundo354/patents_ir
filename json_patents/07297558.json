        "The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device suitable for the manufacturing of a ferroelectric memory.",
        "A ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM) is used as a non-volatile semiconductor memory. The structures of ferroelectric capacitors provided in a ferroelectric memory are broadly classified into the stack structure and the planar structure, and it is ferroelectric capacitors of planar structure that are mass-produced today.",
        "In contrast, from requests for higher packing densities, it is demanded that capacitors of stack construction capable of reducing the cell area be put to practical use. In the stack structure, immediately under a bottom electrode of a ferroelectric capacitor there is provided a contact plug to ensure conduction with a substrate (a diffusion layer). As disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-44376, tungsten or polysilicon is generally used as the material for this contact plug. The contact resistance of a W plug is usually 2 to 3 \u03a9, whereas the contact resistance of a plug formed from polysilicon is 1 to 2 k\u03a9.",
        "A ferroelectric memory is often mounted together with a logic circuit. For example, a security-related chip that requires certification and an IC card are examples. In a logic circuit, usually a W plug is used. Therefore, also in a simulation performed in designing a logic circuit, the resistance value of a W plug is used as a parameter.",
        "Therefore, to use equipment and techniques that have hitherto been used and to suppress an increase in the number of development steps and in cost, it is desirable to use a W plug as in the past in a logic part of a ferroelectric memory that is to be mounted together with a logic circuit.",
        "Usually, in forming a ferroelectric capacitor, various kinds of heat treatment, such as crystallization annealing and recovery annealing, are necessary for obtaining good characteristics. For example, crystallization annealing is RTA (rapid thermal annealing) at 750\u00b0 C. for 60 seconds and recovery annealing is furnace annealing at 650\u00b0 C. for 60 minutes.",
        "However, a W plug has the property of oxidizing at a very high speed and at a low temperature. When oxidation occurs in a part of a W plug once, the oxidation spreads over the whole plug. Therefore, contact defects are apt to occur and yields are apt to decrease. In order to suppress the oxidation of a W plug, it is desirable to lower the annealing temperature.",
        "Thus, various kinds of annealing are required in order to improve the performance of a ferroelectric capacitor, whereas it is necessary to lower the annealing temperature to a somewhat low level in order to prevent an increase in the contact resistance of a W plug immediately under the capacitor. That is, under present circumstances, the performance of a ferroelectric capacitor and the contact performance of a W plug are in a trade-of relation.",
        "Conventionally, after the formation of a ferroelectric capacitor, a contact hole between a bit line of a ferroelectric memory and a substrate is formed by performing etching once. The reason why a contact hole is formed after the formation of a ferroelectric capacitor is that in a case where a contact hole is formed before the formation of a ferroelectric capacitor and a W plug is embedded, the W plug may be oxidized during the formation of the ferroelectric capacitor.",
        "However, when scaling down is promoted in the future, the aspect ratio of a contact hole increases, with the result that etching during the formation of a contact hole, embedding a glue film in a contact hole and the like become difficult.",

        "In a first method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the present invention, first, a switching element is formed on a surface of a semiconductor substrate. Next, an interlayer dielectric film that covers the switching element is formed. Subsequently, in the interlayer dielectric film, a contact hole that reaches a conductive layer of the switching element is formed. After that, a contact plug is embedded in the contact hole. Subsequently, on the interlayer dielectric film, a barrier metal film connected to the contact plug is selectively formed. Next, a first insulating film is formed on the whole surface. Subsequently, a surface slope of the first insulating film is made gentler by performing sputter etching on the first insulating film. And a ferroelectric capacitor is formed on the barrier metal film.",
        "In a second method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the present invention, first, a switching element is formed on a surface of a semiconductor substrate. Next, an interlayer dielectric film that covers the switching element is formed. Subsequently, in the interlayer dielectric film, a contact hole that reaches a conductive layer of the switching element is formed. After that, a contact plug is embedded in the contact hole. Subsequently, on the interlayer dielectric film, a barrier metal film connected to the contact plug is selectively formed. Next, an insulating film thicker than the barrier metal film is formed on the whole surface by a high-density plasma process. And a ferroelectric capacitor is formed on the barrier metal film.",

FIG. 1 is a circuit diagram that shows the construction of a memory cell array of a ferroelectric memory (semiconductor device) manufactured by a method according to an embodiment of the present invention.",
        "This memory cell array is provided with a plurality of bit lines 3 extending in one direction and a plurality of word lines 4 and plate lines 5 extending in the direction perpendicular to the direction in which the bit lines 3 extend. A plurality of memory cells of ferroelectric memory are arranged in array form in such a manner as to be aligned with lattices constituted by these bit lines 3, word lines 4 and plate lines 5. Each memory cell is provided with a ferroelectric capacitor 1 and a MOS transistor 2.",

And the other electrode of the ferroelectric capacitor 1 is connected to the plate line 5. Incidentally, each of the word lines 4 and plate lines 5 is shared by the MOS transistors 2 arranged in the same direction as the direction in which the word lines 4 and plate lines 5 extend. Similarly, each of the bit lines 3 is shared by the MOS transistors 2 arranged in the same direction as the direction in which the bit lines 3 extend.

        "In the memory cell array of a ferroelectric memory constructed in this way, data is stored according to the polarization state of a ferroelectric film provided in the ferroelectric capacitor 1.",
        "A reference example used in the process of making the present invention will be described here. FIGS. 54A and 54B are each a sectional view that shows a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to the reference example. FIGS. 54A and 54B each show a section perpendicular to the direction in which the bit lines 3 extend. FIG. 54A shows the section of a memory cell array part of a ferroelectric memory and FIG. 54B shows the section of a logic part (theoretical circuit part).",
        "In the reference example, first, a MOS transistor (not shown) provided with a source-drain diffusion layer 118 is formed on the surface of a semiconductor substrate (not shown). Next, a silicon oxide film 122 is formed in such a manner as to cover the MOS transistor and the silicon oxide film 122 is planarized by CMP (chemical mechanical polishing) or the like. After that, by forming a contact hole that reaches each source-drain diffusion layer 118 in the silicon oxide film 122, a plug contact part is opened. And after the formation of a glue film 123 in the contact hole, a W film is embedded by a CVD process, for example, and planarization is performed by CMP, whereby a W plug 124 is formed. Subsequently, an Ir film 125 is formed on the whole surface as a W oxidation preventing barrier metal film. After that, the Ir film 125 is patterned with using a hard mask. Subsequently, a W oxidation preventing insulating film 129 and a capacitor adhesive insulating film 150 are formed in this order on the whole surface, and by polishing the capacitor insulating adhesive film 150, the W oxidation preventing insulating film 129 and the Ir film 125 by CMP, the Ir film 125 having a prescribed thickness is caused to remain and the capacitor adhesive insulating film 150 is caused to remain on the W oxidation preventing insulating film 129. The W oxidation preventing insulating film 129 is, for example, a plasma SiON film and the capacitor adhesive insulating film 150 is, for example, a TESO (tetraethylorthosilicate) film.",
        "Next, a bottom electrode film 130, a ferroelectric film 131 and a top electrode film 132 are formed in this order and a ferroelectric capacitor is formed by simultaneously patterning these films. Incidentally, the capacitor adhesive insulating film 150 is formed to prevent the exfoliation of the bottom electrode film 130. Subsequently, a ferroelectric memory is completed by forming an interlayer dielectric film (not shown) and so on.",
        "According to this manufacturing method, even when high-temperature annealing is performed during the formation of a ferroelectric capacitor, the W plug 124 is not apt to be oxidized due to the Ir film (W oxidation preventing barrier metal film) 125 and the W oxidation preventing insulating film 129. Also, concerning the contact between wirings provided in regions higher than the ferroelectric capacitors such as the bit lines and the substrate (the diffusion layer), the formation of the contact holes and the embedding of the glue films and W plugs are performed by two series of the steps. That is, the via-to-via structure is formed. Therefore, the aspect ratio of contact holes decreases and the formation of the contact holes is relatively easy even scaling down is promoted.",
        "However, in the manufacturing method shown in FIGS. 54A and 54B, in a place where the spacing between adjacent Ir films 125 is narrow, the surface of the W oxidation preventing insulating film 129 becomes steep and a deep trench is formed. Therefore, during the formation of the capacitor adhesive insulating film 150 this deep trench is not embedded with the capacitor adhesive insulating film 150 and a clearance 151 remains.",
        "And if the polishing of the capacitor adhesive insulating film 150, the W oxidation preventing insulating film 129 and the Ir film 125 is performed, with the clearance 151 kept, then slits and cracks occur, with the clearance 151 serving as an initiation point as shown in FIGS. 55A and 55B.",
        "Furthermore, during the etching of the top electrode 132 and so on and during the removal of a hard mask used in the etching, with the slits and cracks kept, also the W oxidation preventing insulating film 129 is etched via the slits and cracks and even the interlayer dielectric film 122 might be etched.",
        "Furthermore, if in this state the high-temperature annealing during capacitor formation (crystallization annealing or recovery annealing) is performed, then oxygen reaches even the W plug 124 via the interlayer dielectric film 122 and so on through the slits and cracks and the W plug is oxidized.",
        "Therefore, in the reference example, it is difficult to obtain a high yield with suppressing an increase in contact resistance. Incidentally, even when the method disclosed in the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 4-323821 or the Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 11-133457, it is impossible to prevent the occurrence of slits and cracks in a ferroelectric memory as described above.",
        "Hence, to prevent the occurrence of slits and cracks the present inventors have devoted themselves to examinations and eventually hit upon various forms as described below.",
        "Next, the first embodiment of the present invention will be described. FIGS. 2A and 2B to FIGS. 12A and 12B are sectional views that show, in order of step, a method of manufacturing a ferroelectric memory (semiconductor device) according to the first embodiment of the present invention. Similarly, FIGS. 13A and 13B to FIGS. 23A and 23B are each a sectional view that shows, in order of step, a method of manufacturing a ferroelectric memory according to the first embodiment of the present invention. FIGS. 2A and 2B to FIGS. 12A and 12B each show a section perpendicular to the direction in which bit lines 3 extend, and FIGS. 13A and 13B to FIGS. 23A and 23B each show a section perpendicular to the direction in which word lines 4 extend. FIGS. 13A and 13B each show a part corresponding to two MOS transistors that share one bit line (corresponding to a bit line 3 in FIG. 1). FIGS. 2A to 23A each show the section of a memory cell array part of the ferroelectric memory, and FIGS. 2B to 23B each show the section of a logic part (a logic circuit part) including a driver, a reading-out circuit and the like provided at the periphery of the memory cell array.",
        "In the first embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B and FIG. 13A and 13B, a well 12 is first formed on the surface of a semiconductor substrate 11 such as a silicon substrate. Subsequently, an element isolation region 13 is formed on the surface of the semiconductor substrate 11 with STI (shallow trench isolation), for example. Subsequently a gate insulating film 14, a gate electrode 15, a cap film 16, a side wall 17, a source-drain diffusion layer 18 and a silicide layer 19 are formed on the surface of the well, so that a MOS transistor (a switching element) 20 is formed. This MOS transistor 20 corresponds to a MOS transistor 2 in FIG. 1. Incidentally, for each MOS transistor 20, two source-drain diffusion layers 18 are formed for a source and a drain and one of the source-drain diffusion layers 18 is shared by two MOS transistors 20.",
        "Next, a silicon oxynitride film 21 is formed on the whole surface in such a manner as to cover the MOS transistor 20, a silicon oxide film 22 is further formed on the whole surface as an interlayer dielectric film, and the silicon oxide film 22 is planarized by CMP (chemical mechanical polishing) or the like. The silicon oxynitride film 21 is formed to prevent the hydrogen degradation of the gate insulating film 14 and the like during the formation of the silicon oxide film 22. After that, a contact hole that reaches each silicide layer 19 is formed in the silicon oxide film 22 and the silicon oxynitride film 21, so that a plug contact part is opened. And after the formation of a glue film 23 in the contact hole, a W film is embedded by a CVD process, for example, and planarization is performed by CMP, whereby a W plug (a contact plug) 24 is formed. Subsequently, N2 plasma treatment is performed at 350\u00b0 C. for 120 seconds. As the glue film 23, for example, a stacked member composed of a Ti film having a thickness of 20 nm and a TiN film having a thickness of 50 nm is used.",
        "Subsequently, as shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B and FIGS. 14A and 14B, an Ir film 25 having a thickness of, for example, 450 nm is formed on the whole surface as a W oxidation preventing barrier metal film. After that, a TiN film 26a and a plasma TEOS film 26b that are used as a hard mask during patterning the Ir film 25 are formed in this order. The thickness of the TiN film 26a and the plasma TEOS film 26b are, for example, 200 nm and 1200 nm, respectively. Subsequently, the plasma TEOS film 26b and the TiN film 26a are patterned, so that a hard mask 26 is formed only in a region where a stack type ferroelectric capacitor is to be formed.",
        "Next, as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B and FIGS. 15A and 15B, the etching of the Ir film 25 is performed with using the hard mask 26.",
        "After that, as shown FIGS. 5A and 5B and FIGS. 16A and 16B, a plasma SiON film (a first insulating film) 27 is formed. The thickness of the plasma SiON film 27 is, for example, 150 nm. At this point of time, a relatively steep and deep trench is present on the plasma SiON film 27 particularly in a region to which the island-like Ir film 25 stands close.",
        "Subsequently, Ar sputter etching is performed on the plasma SiON film 27. Concerning the conditions for Ar sputter etching, for example, for an RF power source, the source power is 1500 W (13.56 MHz) and the bias power is 1600 W (800 kHz). Also, the pressure in the chamber is 13.3 Pa (100 mTorr), the flow rate of Ar gas is 400 sccm, and the etching time is 30 seconds. As a result, after the removal of the part of the plasma SiON film 27 on the hard mask 26, etching is completed before the part of the plasma SiON film 27 on the silicon oxide film 22 is completely removed. In this Ar sputter etching, generated residues accumulate on the part of the plasma SiON film 27 that remains at that time. And as shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B and FIGS. 17A and 17B, the surface of the plasma SiON film 27 becomes gentler gradually and the shape of the plasma SiON film 27 approaches a flat shape. Therefore, the steep and deep trench disappears from the plasma SiON film 27.",
        "Next, as shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B and FIGS. 18A and 18B, a plasma SiON film (a second insulating film) 28 is formed. The thickness of the plasma SiON film 28 is, for example, 900 nm. Because at this time there is no steep and deep trench in the plasma SiON film 27, no void is generated between the plasma SiON film 28 and the plasma SiON film 27. A W oxidation preventing insulating film 29 that prevents the oxidation of the W plug 24 exposed in the logic part is composed of the plasma SiON films 27 and 28.",
        "Subsequently, as shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B and FIGS. 19A and 19B, the W oxidation preventing insulating film 29 (the plasma SiON films 27 and 28), the hard mask 36 (the plasma TEOS film 26b and the TiN film 26a) and the Ir film 25 are polished by a CMP process. At this time, the remaining film thickness of the Ir film 25 and W oxidation preventing insulating film 29 after CMP is, for example, 350 nm.",
        "In manufacturing a ferroelectric memory, it is necessary to perform, after that, etching of a film that constitutes a ferroelectric capacitor, and removal of a hard mask used in this etching, as will be described later. And as a result of the etching and removal, the thickness of the W oxidation preventing insulating film 29 will decrease by about 250 nm. Also, after the removal of the hard mask, to recover damage during etching, for example, furnace heat treatment is to be performed in an oxygen atmosphere at 650\u00b0 C. for 60 minutes. At this time, it is necessary that in order to prevent the oxidation of the W plug 24, the W oxidation preventing insulating film 29 have a thickness of not less than 100 nm. Therefore, in this embodiment, to ensure that a thickness of about 100 nm remains even when the thickness of the W oxidation preventing insulating film 29 decreases by about 250 nm, the remaining film thickness of the W oxidation preventing insulating film 29 should be, for example, 350 nm.",
        "After that, as shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B and FIGS. 20A and 20B, a bottom electrode film 30, a ferroelectric film 31 and a top electrode film 32 are formed in this order on the whole surface. For example, a stacked member composed of a 200 nm thick Ir film, a 23 nm thick PtO film and a 50 nm thick Pt film, which are formed in this order, is used as the bottom electrode film 30. A Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 film (PZT film) having a thickness of, for example, 200 nm is used as the ferroelectric film 31. An IrO2 film having a thickness of, for example, 200 nm is used as the top electrode film 32.",
        "Incidentally, before and after the formation of the bottom electrode film 30, annealing for preventing film exfoliation is performed. For example, RTA (rapid thermal annealing) is performed in an Ar atmosphere at 750\u00b0 C. for 60 seconds as the annealing. Also, after the formation of the ferroelectric film 31, crystallization annealing is performed. For example, RTA at 600\u00b0 C. for 90 seconds using Ar and O2, and RTA in an oxygen atmosphere at 750\u00b0 C. for 60 seconds are performed as the annealing.",
        "After the formation of the top electrode film 32, a TiN film 33a and a plasma TEOS film 33b which are used as a hard mask during patterning the bottom electrode film 30, the ferroelectric film 31 and the top electrode film 32 are formed in this order. Subsequently, the plasma TEOS film 33b and the TiN film 33a are patterned, so that a hard mask 33 is formed only in a region where a stack type ferroelectric capacitor is to be formed.",
        "Subsequently, as shown in FIGS. 10A and 10B and FIGS. 21A and 21B, a stack type ferroelectric capacitor is formed by spontaneously processing the top electrode film 32, the ferroelectric film 31 and the bottom electrode film 30 with patterning and etching techniques using the hard mask 33 as a mask. This ferroelectric capacitor corresponds to the ferroelectric capacitor 1 shown in FIG. 1.",
        "Next, as shown in FIGS. 11A and 11B and FIGS. 22A and 22B, the hard mask 33 is removed. As a result of the processing from the etching of the top electrode film 32, the ferroelectric film 31 and the bottom electrode film 30 to the removal of the hard mask 33, the thickness of the W oxidation preventing insulating film 29 decreases by about 250 nm and the W oxidation preventing insulating film 29 remains about 100 nm. Subsequently, to recover damage to the ferroelectric film 31 by film forming and etching processes and the like, recovery annealing is performed. At the recovery annealing, furnace annealing is performed, for example, in an oxygen atmosphere at 650\u00b0 C. for 60 minutes.",
        "After that, as shown in FIGS. 12A and 12B and FIGS. 23A and 23B, an alumina film 34 is formed on the whole surface as a protective film that protects the ferroelectric capacitor from process damage. The thickness of the alumina film 34 is, for example, 50 nm. Next, furnace annealing is performed, for example, in an oxygen atmosphere at 650\u00b0 C. for 60 minutes. Subsequently, an interlayer dielectric film 35 is formed on the whole surface and the planarization of the interlayer dielectric film 35 is performed by CMP. The remaining film thickness of the interlayer dielectric film 35 after the CMP is, for example, 400 nm on the top electrode film 32.",
        "Subsequently, by patterning and etching techniques, a contact hole that reaches the W plug 24 is formed in the interlayer dielectric film 35, alumina film 34 and W oxidation preventing insulating film 29. Next, annealing is performed, for example, in an oxygen atmosphere at 550\u00b0 C. for 60 minutes. Subsequently, after forming a glue film 36 in the contact hole, a W film is embedded and planarization is performed by CMP, whereby a W plug 37 is formed. As the glue film 36, TiN having a thickness of, for example, 50 nm can be used. After that, the surfaces of the interlayer dielectric film 35 and W plug 37 are exposed to N2 plasma, for example, at 350\u00b0 C. The time of this plasma treatment is, for example, 120 seconds.",
        "Subsequently, a W oxidation preventing insulating film (not shown) is formed on the whole surface. For example, an SiON film is used as the W oxidation preventing insulating film and the thickness thereof is, for example, about 100 nm. Then., with patterning and etching techniques a contact hole that reaches the top electrode film 32 is formed in the W oxidation preventing insulating film and the interlayer dielectric film 35. Subsequently, annealing to recover damage by etching is performed. This annealing is performed, for example, in an oxygen atmosphere at 550\u00b0 C. for 60 minutes. After this annealing, the W oxidation preventing insulating film is removed by etch back.",
        "Next, a lower-layer glue film 38, a wiring material film 39 and an upper-layer glue film 40 are deposited in this order. As the lower-layer glue film, a TiN film having a thickness of, for example, 100 nm is used. As the wiring material film, an Al\u2014Cu alloy film having a thickness of, for example, 400 nm is used. As the upper-layer glue film, for example, a stacked member composed of a Ti film having a thickness of 5 nm and a TiN film having a thickness of 70 nm is used.",
        "Subsequently, an antireflection film (not shown) is formed on the glue film 40 and a resist film (not shown) is applied. Subsequently, the resist film is processed in such a manner as to be aligned with a wiring pattern, and the antireflection film, the glue film 40, the wiring material film 39 and the glue film 38 are etched with using the resist film after processing as a mask. As the antireflection film, for example, an SiON film is used and the thickness thereof is, for example, about 31 nm. As a result of the etching, as shown in FIGS. 12A and 12B and FIGS. 23A and 23B, a wiring 41 of a prescribed plane shape that is composed of the glue film 40, the wiring material film 39 and the glue film 38 is obtained.",
        "After that, the formation of an interlayer dielectric film, the formation of a contact plug, the formation of wirings for the second and later layers, and the like are further carried out. And a cover film that is composed, for example, of a TEOS film and an SiN film is formed, so that a ferroelectric memory having a ferroelectric capacitor is completed. Incidentally, in the formation of upper-layer wirings, the wiring 41 connected to the top electrode film 32 is connected to the plate line and the wiring 41 connected to the source-drain diffusion layer 18 shared by the two MOS transistors 20 is connected to the bit line. For the gate electrode 15, the gate electrode 15 may be the word line itself or in the upper-layer wirings, the gate electrode 15 may be connected to the word line.",
        "As described above, in the first embodiment, in forming the W oxidation preventing insulating film 29 having a thickness of about 350 nm, the plasma SiON film 27 of about 150 nm is first formed and a steep trench is caused to disappear from the plasma SiON film 27 by performing Ar sputter etching, and then, the plasma SiON film 28 of about 900 nm is formed. Therefore, according to the first embodiment, the generation of voids in the W oxidation preventing insulating film 29 is prevented. As a result, it becomes possible to suppress a rise in contact resistance even when the annealing temperature is raised while preventing the occurrence of cracks and slits.",
        "Furthermore, according to this embodiment, in the logic part, as shown in FIGS. 12B and 23B, a via-to-via contact is realized from the W plugs 37 and 24. And the wiring 41 is connected to the source-drain diffusion layer 18 via this via-to-via contact. Because a large level difference corresponding to a ferroelectric capacitor is present in a ferroelectric memory compared to a usual logic article, the aspect ratio of the contact from the lowest-layer wiring 41 to the substrate (or a diffusion layer formed thereon) is relatively large. If in order to form the contact, a contact hole is opened by etching at once as in the conventional way, etching itself is difficult. Also, formation of a glue film is difficult. Therefore, new equipment suitable for opening such a contact hole and forming a glue film is necessary. In contrast, because etching and the formation of a glue film are relatively easy when a via-to-via hole is formed, it is possible to improve the yield of a ferroelectric memory and conventional equipments can be used as it is. Therefore, it is possible to reduce development expenses and process costs.",
        "Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. FIGS. 24A and 24B to FIGS. 32A and 32B are sectional views that show, in order of step, a method of manufacturing a ferroelectric memory (semiconductor device) according to the second embodiment of the present invention. These figures each show a section perpendicular to the direction in which bit lines 3 extend. FIGS. 24A to 32A each show the section of a memory cell array of the ferroelectric memory, and FIGS. 24B to 32B each show the section of a logic part.",
        "In the second embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 24A and 24B, series of processing from the formation of the well 12 to the formation of the W plug 24 are first performed in the same manner as with the first embodiment.",
        "Next, as shown in FIGS. 25A and 25B, series of processing from the formation of the Ir film 25 to the formation of the hard mask 26 are performed in the same manner as with the first embodiment.",
        "Subsequently, as shown in FIGS. 26A and 26B, the etching of the Ir film 25 is performed with using the hard mask 26 in the same manner as with the first embodiment.",
        "After that, as shown in FIGS. 27A and 27B, an SiON film 42 is formed as a W oxidation preventing insulating film on the whole surface by an HDP (high density plasma) process. The thickness of the SiON film 42 is, for example, 400 nm. Because a good coverage is obtained with the HDP process, it is possible to form the SiON film 43 without the occurrence of voids.",
