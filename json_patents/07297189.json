    "title": "JR dust clean vacuum",
    "abstract": "The present invention consists of a system related to vacuum cleaners, more specifically, to a system designed to filter the micro-dust that escapes from the bag with the air. The inlet turbine will suck the dirt into the vacuum cleaner bag Zone 1 where the air will escape into Zone 2. At the same time, the micro-dust will also escape with the air into Zone 2. The exhaust turbine sucks the dust content air in Zone 2; hence, the dust content air will travel through the dust collector pipes then through the dust collector main pipe, then through the small \u201cL\u201d type pipes, then hit the water dumping the dust into the water in the compartment one. The dust content air then travels up to get into the small \u201cL\u201d type pipes in the compartment two, then hits the water.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The invention relates to vacuum cleaners. JR Dust Clean Vacuum Cleaners R1 and R2 are designed to filter the micro particles that normally escape with the exhaust air in a vacuum cleaner. R1 Model is called the Dry JR Dust Clean Vacuum Cleaner, and the R2 Model is called the Wet JR Dust Clean Vacuum Cleaner. But the principles that are practiced in both of them are the same.",
        "2. Description of the Background",
        "The present invention relates to vacuum cleaners. There are a number of models in the market. JR Dust Clean Vacuum Cleaner is designed to have two zone systems called Zone 1, the dirt zone, and Zone 2, the dust zone. JR Dust Clean Vacuum Cleaners come with inlet turbine to suck the dirt into the vacuum cleaner bag and exhauster turbine to suck the micro-dust content air from Zone 2 through the dust collector pipe, then through the dust collector zone, then and to exhaust the clean air from the vacuum cleaner.",
        "JR Dust Clean Vacuum Cleaner R1, R2 Models are designed to filter all the micro-dust from the air that escapes from the bag which is situated in Zone 1, before the air is exhausted out of the vacuum cleaner.",
        "With the JR Dust Clean Vacuum Cleaner Models R1 and R2, the engineering practices are the same, but Model R2 comes with a dust collector tank to improve the dust purification efficiently. A normal wet JR Dust Clean Vacuum Cleaner comes with one dust collector tank, but the Model R2 comes with a four compartment dust collector tank which purifies the air four times by removing the dust from the air. JR Dust Clean Vacuum Cleaners have two turbines: one is the inlet turbine, the other is an exhaust turbine. Once the JR Vacuum Cleaner is switched on, both fans will kick in simultaneously and when shut off, the inlet will shut off first, and the exhaust will shut off a few minutes later.",
        "The dry JR Dust Clean Vacuum Cleaner Model R1 does not come with a dust collector tank. Instead of the tank, it is equipped with a moisturized filter that will collect the dust before it is exhausted.",
        "Another advantage of the JR Dust Clean Vacuum Cleaner Model R1 is that once the vacuum is done, the filter can be removed and washed for reuse. With Model R2, the water that collected the dust can be flushed out by forcing water through the dust water inlet pipe after opening the dust water outlet tap.",
        "Another advantage is a level control float device is equipped between the reservoir and the collector tank. This will maintain a constant distance between the outlet small \u201cL\u201d type pipe and top of the water level to create a better dust collection.",
        "A more complete understanding of the present invention may be derived from referring to the detailed description and claims when considered in connection with the figures where reference letters and numbers are similar items throughout the figures.",

Hence, it keeps repeating and depends on the amount of compartments. Most of the vacuum cleaners would be able to purify with two compartments.",
