        "The present invention pertains to a power amplifying apparatus and relates in particular to a power amplifying apparatus comprising a push-pull amplifier.",
        "A push-pull amplifier is a typical power amplifying means. A push-pull amplifier is an amplifier made from a pair of transistors and is such that the output from each of the transistors in the pair is synthesized to obtain a signal output (for instance, refer to JP (Kokai) 2003-060,451 (pages 4 and 5, FIG. 1)).",
        "A circuit diagram of a typical power amplifying apparatus comprising a push-pull amplifier is shown in FIG. 1. A power amplifying apparatus 10 in FIG. 1 comprises an input terminal X1, an operational amplifier A11, a push-pull amplifier 100, and an output terminal Y1. Input terminal X1 is connected to the inverting input of operational amplifier A11. The output signals of operational amplifier A11 are input to a push-pull amplifier 100. The output signals of push pull amplifier 100 are applied to output terminal Y1 and to the non-inverting input of operational amplifier A11. It should be noted that a load Z is connected to output terminal Y1 in order to facilitate understanding of the description that follows. Moreover, load Z is a resistor.",
        "Push-pull amplifier 100 is a bipolar push-pull amplifier that uses MOS-type field effect transistors. Push-pull amplifier 100 comprises an input terminal S1, an output terminal T1, a P channel MOS-type field effect transistor Q11, and an N channel MOS-type field effect transistor Q12. The source of field effect transistor Q11 is connected to a positive power source Vcc. The source of field effect transistor Q12 is connected to a negative power source Vee. The output signals of operational amplifier A11 are applied through a constant-voltage source E11 to the gate of field effect transistor Q11. Moreover, the output signals of operational amplifier A11 are applied through a constant-voltage source E12 to the gate of field effect transistor Q12. The drain of field effect transistor Q11 and the drain of field effect transistor Q12 are connected together. Moreover, these drains are connected to output terminal Y1. In short, push-pull amplifier 100 is a drain output-type push-pull amplifier that outputs signals that have been inverted with respect to signals received at S1. Constant-voltage source E11 and constant-voltage source E12 are used for bias. Push-pull amplifier 100 can be operated as a class A, class AB, or class B amplifier by adjusting the magnitude of the bias.",
        "Moreover, operational amplifier A11 acts in such a way that there is no difference between the voltage at input terminal X1 and the voltage at output terminal Y1. As a result, power amplifying apparatus 10 power-amplifies signals input from input terminal X1 and outputs them from output terminal Y1.",
        "The loop gain (dB) of power amplifying apparatus 10 is the sum of the amplification factor (dB) of operational amplifier A11 and the amplification factor (dB) of push-pull amplifier 100. In general, the amplification factor of operational amplifier A11 is set so that it decreases with an increase in frequency, while the amplification factor of push-pull amplifier 100 is set so that it is constant regardless of frequency. Moreover, the amplification factor of push-pull amplifier 100 decreases as the drain current of field effect transistor Q11 or Q12 becomes smaller. The reason for this is as follows.",
        "The amplification factor GM of push-pull amplifier 100 is the sum of amplification factor gm1 of field effect transistor Q11 and amplification factor gm2 of field effect transistor Q12. The AC amplification factor of a field effect transistor is represented by mutual conductance gm. It should be noted that mutual conductance gm is also represented as forward transmission admittance |Yfs|. The mutual conductance of a field effect transistor is virtually zero as long as the gate voltage is the threshold voltage or less. The drain current increases as gate voltage rises. As a result, mutual conductance gm increases. Therefore, it is assumed that push-pull amplifier 100 operates as a class AB amplifier. In general, the drain current of field effect transistor Q11 is large and the amplification factor gm1 of field effect transistor Q11 is also large when push-pull amplifier 100 outputs a large positive voltage. In this case, gm1 dominates the amplification factor GM; therefore, GM is large, as well as gm1. The drain current of field effect transistor Q11 decreases and gm1 also becomes smaller as the output voltage of push-pull amplifier 100 gradually decreases. The drain current of field effect transistor Q12 at this time is small and the amplification factor gm2 of field effect transistor Q12 is also small. There is a gradual increase in gm2 as the output voltage of push-pull amplifier 100 falls closer to zero. However, the amplification factor GM is quite small at this time. Thereafter, amplification factor gm2 of field effect transistor Q12 increases with a further reduction in the output voltage of push-pull amplifier 100. The amplification factor GM is now dominated by gm2 at this time; therefore, GM is large, as well as gm2. Similarly, the overall amplification factor GM changes dependent on the drain current of each field effect transistor and the output voltage of push-pull amplifier 100.",
        "Power amplifying apparatus 10 has a finite frequency band; therefore, the frequency band of power amplifying apparatus 10 becomes narrower as the AC amplification factor of push-pull amplifier 100 decreases. Moreover, the frequency band of power amplifying apparatus 10 changes considerably as the change in the drain current of field effect transistor Q11 or Q12 becomes larger. Power amplifying apparatus 10 tends to vibrate and outputs an unwanted ringing waveshape as the amount of change in the frequency band increases. Furthermore, there is also a problem with this type of power amplifying apparatus 10 in that when there is high-speed change in the size of the load, it is difficult to maintain a constant output level.",
        "The current amplification factor hfe of a bipolar transistor decreases with a reduction in the collector current. Consequently, the above-mentioned problem similarly occurs in a push-pull amplifier made from a pair of bipolar transistors and a push-pull amplifier made from a pair comprised of a bipolar transistor and a field effect transistor. Moreover, this problem becomes more obvious as the electrical efficiency of the push-pull amplifier improves. This is because the idle drain current and collector current are set at zero or at a relatively small value.",
        "The present invention solves the above-mentioned problems, an object thereof being to provide a push-pull amplifier that prevents the reduction in the AC amplification factor that is attributed to changes in the collector current or the source current of the transistors. Moreover, an object of the present invention is to provide a power amplifying apparatus comprising this type of push-pull amplifier.",
        "The present invention provides that the amplification factor in the high-frequency band of a push-pull amplifier made of a pair comprised of a push-side transistor and a pull-side transistor is compensated when the collector current or source current of the transistor on the push side or of the transistor on the pull side is within a predetermined range. In order to compensate the amplification factor, the push-pull amplifier of the present invention manipulates signals applied to the base or the gate of the transistor on the push side or of the transistor on the pull side, or directly supplements output signals.",
        "The present invention provides for a push-pull amplifier. The push-pull amplifier includes a pair of transistors, wherein each of the transistors has a control terminal, a first terminal, and a second terminal. A current that flows between the first terminal and the second terminal is controlled in accordance with signals applied to the control terminal, such that when an amount of current flowing between the first terminal and the second terminal of one of the transistors is within a predetermined range, a high-frequency component of the signals input to the control terminal of one of the transistors is amplified, and when this current is outside the predetermined range, the high frequency component is not amplified.",
        "The present invention also provides for a push-pull amplifier having an input terminal, an output terminal, a pair of transistors, and an amplifier. The pair of transistors amplifies signals received at the input terminal, and output to the output terminal. Each of the transistors includes a control terminal, a first terminal, and a second terminal that controls a current flowing between the first terminal and the second terminal in accordance with signals applied to the control terminal. The amplifier is for amplifying only a high-frequency component extracted from the signals received at the input terminal, and outputting the amplified signal to the output terminal when an amount of current flowing between the first and second terminals of one of the transistors is within a predetermined range. The amplifier is turned off when the amount of current flowing is outside the predetermined range.",
        "Another aspect of the present invention provides for a power amplifying apparatus. The power amplifying apparatus includes a push-pull amplifier having a pair of transistors, wherein each of the transistors has a control terminal, a first terminal, and a second terminal, and wherein a current that flows between the first terminal and the second terminal is controlled in accordance with signals applied to the control terminal, such that when an amount of current flowing between the first terminal and the second terminal of one of the transistors is within a predetermined range, a high-frequency component of signals input to the control terminal of one of the transistors is amplified. When this current is outside the predetermined range, the high-frequency component is not amplified.",
        "Yet another aspect of the present invention provides for a power amplifying apparatus that includes a push-pull amplifier having an input terminal, an output terminal, a pair of transistors, and an amplifier.

        "By means of the present invention, it is possible to control the changes in the AC amplification factor that are attributed to changes in the collector current or source current of one of the pair of transistors of a push-pull amplifier comprising at least one pair of transistors. Moreover, by means of the present invention, it is possible to control the reduction in the AC amplification factor when the collector current or the source current of one of a pair of transistors is small in a push-pull amplifier comprising at least one pair of transistors. As a result, a power amplifying apparatus that uses this type of push-pull amplifier can amplify with stability signals of a higher frequency than in the past.",

High-pass filter F2 extracts the high-frequency component of signals received at input terminal S2 and outputs the filtered product to amplifier A23. The cut-off frequency of high-pass filter F2 is set such that it includes the band that should be compensated. Amplifier A23 amplifies input signals by a predetermined amplitude and then outputs the amplified signal. Amplifier A23 operates in accordance with output signals of operational amplifier A22. In further detail, amplifier A23 outputs signals only when the amount of current flowing between the source and drain of field effect transistor Q21 is a predetermined value or less. Capacitor C2 is used in order to obtain the alternating current component from the output signals of amplifier A23. Resistors R22 and R23 operate as a signal adding means.",
