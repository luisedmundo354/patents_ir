        "This application is related to an application by CHIU-LIEN YANG and WEI-YI LING entitled LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY DEVICE, filed on the same day as the present application and assigned to the same assignee as the present application.",
        "The present invention relates to liquid crystal display (LCD) devices, and more particularly to a reflection/transmission type LCD device capable of providing a display both in a reflection mode and a transmission mode.",
        "Conventionally, there have been three types of LCD devices commercially available: a reflection type LCD device utilizing ambient light, a transmission type LCD device utilizing backlight, and a semi-transmission type LCD device equipped with a half mirror and a backlight.",
        "With a reflection type LCD device, a display becomes less visible in a dim environment. In contrast, with a transmission type LCD device, a display becomes hazy in strong ambient light (e.g., outdoor sunlight). Thus researchers sought to provide an LCD device capable of functioning in both modes so as to yield a satisfactory display in any environment. In due course, a semi-transmission type LCD device was disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 7-333598.",
        "However, the above-mentioned conventional semi-transmission type LCD device has the following problems.",
        "The conventional semi-transmission type LCD device uses a half mirror in place of a reflective plate used in a reflection type LCD device, and has a minute transmission region (e.g., minute holes in a metal thin film) in a reflection region, thereby providing a display by utilizing transmitted light as well as reflected light. Since reflected light and transmitted light used for a display pass through the same liquid crystal layer, an optical path of reflected light becomes twice as long as that of transmitted light. This causes a large difference in retardation of the liquid crystal layer with respect to reflected light and transmitted light. Thus, a satisfactory display cannot be obtained. Furthermore, a display in a reflection mode and a display in a transmission mode are superimposed on each other, so that the respective displays cannot be separately optimized. This results in difficulty in providing a color display, and tends to cause a blurred display.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, a liquid crystal display device includes a first and a second substrates, a liquid crystal layer having liquid crystal molecules interposed between the first and second substrates. A common electrode and an upper alignment film orderly dispose at an inner surface of the first substrate. A pixel electrode and a lower alignment film orderly dispose at an inner surface of the second substrate.",
        "The liquid crystal display device includes a plurality of pixel regions. Each of the pixel regions defines a reflection region and a transmission region. The pixel electrode in each reflection regions cooperate with and/or are configured as reflection electrodes, and the pixel electrode in each transmission regions are configured as transmission electrodes. A thickness of the liquid crystal layer in the reflection regions is less than a thickness of the liquid crystal layer in the transmission regions. A pre-tilt angle of liquid crystal molecules adjacent to one of the substrates is in a range of 0\u00b0 to 15\u00b0, and a pre-tilt angle of liquid crystal molecules adjacent to another substrate is in a range of 75\u00b0 to 90\u00b0.",
        "In each pixel region of the LCD device, the liquid crystal molecules adjacent to the two substrates have a pre-tilt angle in a range of 0\u00b0 to 15\u00b0 or 75\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 respectively, which ensures that the liquid crystal molecules can more easily twist when a voltage is applied thereto. Thereby, the LCD device 20 has a fast response time.",

        "FIG. 3 shows a polarized state of light in each of certain layers of the LCD device 20 when the LCD device 20 operates in a reflection mode. When no voltage is applied to the LCD device 20, the LCD device 20 is in an on-state. Ambient incident light becomes linearly-polarized light having a polarizing direction 272\u2032 after passing through the polarizer 272. Then the linearly-polarized light passes through the second upper retardation film 261 (a half-wave plate). The polarized state of the linearly-polarized light is not changed, and the polarizing direction thereof twists by an amount of 2\u03b8. Thereafter, the linear-polarized light is incident upon the first upper retardation film 263 (a quarter-wave plate), and becomes circularly-polarized light. Then the circularly-polarized light passes through the first upper compensation film 265 and is incident on the liquid crystal layer 230. Since an effective phase difference of the liquid crystal layer 230 in an on-state is adjusted to a wavelength of \u03bb/4 in order to obtain a white display, the incident circularly-polarized light becomes linearly-polarized light. The linearly-polarized light exiting the liquid crystal layer 230 is reflected by the reflection electrodes 254. The linearly-polarized light keeps its polarized state, and is incident on the liquid crystal layer 230 again. The linearly-polarized light passing through the liquid crystal layer 230 becomes circularly-polarized light having a polarizing direction opposite to that of the circularly-polarized light originally incident on the liquid crystal layer 230. The circularly-polarized light exiting the liquid crystal layer 230 is converted to linearly-polarized light by the quarter-wave plate 263. Thereafter, the linearly-polarized light passes through the half-wave plate 261, and is output through the polarizer 272 for displaying images.",
        "On the other hand, when a voltage is applied to the LCD device 20, the LCD device 20 is in an off-state. Up to the point where ambient incident light reaches the liquid crystal layer 230, the ambient incident light undergoes transmission in substantially the same way as described above in relation to the LCD device 20 being in the on-state. Since an effective phase difference of the liquid crystal layer 230 is adjusted to be 0 by applying a voltage in order to obtain a black display, the circularly-polarized light incident on the liquid crystal layer 230 passes therethrough as circularly-polarized light. The circularly-polarized light exiting the liquid crystal layer 230 is reflected by the reflection electrodes 254. The circularly-polarized light keeps its polarized state, and is incident on the liquid crystal layer 230 again. After passing through the the liquid crystal layer 230, the circularly-polarized light is converted into linearly-polarized light by the first upper retardation film 263 (a quarter-wave plate). At this time, the polarizing direction of the linearly-polarized light is rotated by about 90\u00b0 compared with that of a white display state. Then the linearly-polarized light passes through the second upper polarized film 261 (a half-wave plate), and is absorbed by the polarizer 272. Thus the linearly-polarized light is not output from the LCD device 20 for displaying images.",
        "FIG. 4 shows a polarized state of light in each of certain layers of the LCD device 20 for an on-state (white state) and an off-state (black state) when the LCD device 20 operates in a transmission mode. Incident light undergoes transmission in a manner similar to that described above in relation to the LCD device 20 operating in the reflection mode.",
        "In each pixel region of the LCD device 20, the liquid crystal molecules have a pre-tilt angle, which ensures that the liquid crystal molecules can more easily twist when a voltage is applied thereto.
