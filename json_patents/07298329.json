        "The present invention generally relates to antennas comprising an array of radiating elements, and methods for exciting the array elements in a manner that exploits the mutual coupling effects between the elements. More particularly, the present invention relates to systems and methods for providing differential-mode excitation of microstrip patch antennas and monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) antenna arrays, wherein radiation is generated and emitted from substantially the entire top surfaces of the patches, rather than merely from their edges, thereby enhancing the radiation and improving efficiency. Differential-mode excitation schemes according to the invention may be used for, e.g., electronically steering a radiating beam, shaping a radiating beam, and optimizing the gain of the antenna array in a specified direction.",
        "Microstrip antennas (or patch antennas) provide low-profile antenna configurations for applications that require small size and weight. Such antennas are also desirable when there is a need to conform to the shape of the supporting structure, both planar and nonplanar, such as for an aircraft's aerodynamic profile. These antennas are simple and inexpensive to manufacture using printed-circuit technology, wherein metallic patches (or patch radiators) are typically photoetched onto a dielectric substrate.",
        "The conventional wisdom regarding microwave patch antennas is that the patches radiate from their edges. More specifically, when the elements of a patch antenna array are excited in common mode (i.e., with equal voltages), the fields that are generated are primarily confined to the dielectric space under each surface element, except for the fringing fields at the edges of the elements. The commonly held view of the mechanism of radiation by patch antennas is that it is the fringing fields at the edges that radiate into the air. Indeed, various models and theoretical analyses have been developed to explain this radiation mechanism, such as the slot radiation model (see, e.g., R. E. Munson, \u201cConformal microstrip antennas and microstrip phase arrays,\u201d IEEE Trans. Antennas Propagat., vol. 22, pp 74-78. January, 1974) or the cavity model (see, e.g., Thouroude et al, \u201cCAD-oriented cavity model for rectangular patches,\u201d Elect. Lett., vol. 26. pp. 842-844, June 1990). Both the slot and cavity models assume radiation comes only from the edges. Other models known to those skilled in the art, including, for example, conformal mapping, moment methods, and Green's functions, have been developed, which implicitly include fields that are not at the edges. However, these methods offer limited insight into the radiation mechanism.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates a typical patch antenna array 10 that comprises small conducting surfaces 18 separated from a large parallel ground plane 14 by a dielectric substrate 16. When the same real or complex (real and imaginary or amplitude and phase) RF voltage V0 is applied to each surface 18, an electric field pattern 15 is set up in the dielectric, essentially acting as a capacitor but with a relatively weak fringing fields 12 at the edges (for clarity, fields 12 are not shown continuing into the substrate). The roughly uniform fields 15 under the surface are fairly well shielded from the outside space, but the fringing field at the edges can act as radiating elements. To take advantage of the edge radiators, it may be necessary to excite the capacitive structure in a higher-order mode and using off-center feeds, to avoid mutual cancellation of the radiation from different edges.",
        "Microstrip patch antennas commonly exhibit disadvantageous operational characteristics such as low efficiency, low power, narrow bandwidth, and poor scanning performance. Further, patch antennas are typically excited in an asymmetric manner to generate high-order modes of the dielectric substrate, which adds to the complexity of the electrical feed circuitry.",
        "A natural phenomenon referred to as \u201cmutual coupling\u201d occurs when the patches of an antenna array are subjected to differential-mode excitation (e.g., different voltage amplitudes and phases). In particular, when the applied voltages at two or more patches are different, fields will be set up not only within the substrate directly under each patch, but also in the air space above the patches, emanating from one patch and ending on another.",
        "Conventionally, designers of patch antennas ignore or attempt to reduce the effects of mutual coupling. However, it would be highly beneficial to develop a framework for differential-mode excitation of an antenna array that would exploit the mutual coupling between patches to provide efficient radiation from the exposed top surfaces of antenna patches to, thereby, overcome the above noted deficiencies and disadvantages of conventional patch antenna schemes.",
        "The present invention is generally directed to antennas comprising an array of radiating elements, and methods for exciting the array elements in a manner that exploits the mutual coupling effects between the elements. More particularly, the present invention relates to systems and methods for providing differential-mode excitation of microstrip patch antennas and monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) antenna arrays. It is an objective of the present invention to devise and prescribe differential-mode excitation methods, which impose different radio frequency (RF) voltages or currents at the different array elements (e.g., patches), to thereby generate and emit radiation from substantially the entire top surfaces of the patches, rather than merely from their edges, thereby enhancing the radiation and improving efficiency. Indeed, differential-mode excitation methods according to the invention are employed to operate an antenna array in a manner that exploits the particular susceptibility of array elements to mutual coupling effects such that the array radiates copiously from the top surfaces of the patches instead of merely from their edges.",
        "Various methods according to the invention are provided for generating optimal differential-mode voltages or currents that are applied to elements of an array to thereby achieve particular radiation characteristics. For example, differential-mode excitation schemes enable electronic steering of a radiating beam, shaping of a radiating beam, and optimizing the gain of the antenna array in a specified direction.",

        "In another aspect of the invention, a computer is employed to generate a stream of complex numbers (which represent the excitation voltages or currents) that are determined using a radiation model that provides an efficient, yet accurate, model for determining a radiation pattern emitted from an antenna array operating in differential mode. Optimal excitation voltages or currents can be determined to achieve one of possible objectives, such as aiming or steering a radiating beam or optimizing the gain.",
        "In another aspect, various devices and methods are provided for feeding the excitation RF voltages or currents addressed to each radiating element individually, with amplitudes and phases prescribed by the determined complex numbers.

        "I. General Overview",
        "The present invention exploits the discovery that an antenna array of two or more individually excitable patches can function through the mutual coupling phenomenon in a manner that permits the patches to radiate from their outer surfaces instead of merely from their edges, when the excitation of the patches is in suitable differential-mode, with at least one voltage or current having different amplitudes and phases. More specifically, it has been determined that when different voltages or currents are applied at two or more patches in the antenna array (i.e., using differential-mode excitation), fields will exist not only within the substrate directly under each patch but also in the air space above the patches, emanating from one patch and ending on another.",
        "FIG. 2 is an exemplary diagram illustrating field patterns that are generated by a patch antenna array 20 when operating in differential-mode according to the invention. The patch antenna array 20 comprises two small conducting surfaces 28, separated from a large parallel ground plane 24 by a dielectric substrate 26. As shown, a coupling field pattern 22 exists in the air space above the patches. The coupling fields 22 in air space are unshielded. The coupling fields 22 radiate copiously and occupy regions of space that correspond to the entire area of each patch 28, not just the edges of the patch. Further, a field pattern 25 exists within the substrate 26 directly under each patch 28. It is to be understood that weak fringing fields also exist at the edges of the patches 28 and in the substrate 26, but an illustration of such weak fields is omitted from FIG. 2 to promote clarity.",
        "The field patterns 22, 25 are generated when the two patches 28 are excited by, e.g., two different RF real or complex voltages V1 and V2. The coupling fields 22 require a voltage difference between patches and, in accordance with the invention, the patches are effective as radiators when the array is operated in differential-mode. The coupling fields 22 in the air space above the patches oscillate in time and therefore constitute displacements current that radiate outwards into space. In general, the coupling fields 22 arc from one patch to the other, necessarily beginning and ending perpendicular to the conducting patch surfaces. In FIG. 2, the field lines 22 that provide mutual coupling of the two patches 28 in the air space are shown as being semicircular. It is to be understood that the semicircular shape of the field pattern 22 is an approximation that is used to facilitate calculations of the field pattern. Indeed, the actual field lines follow some other arc through the air from one patch to the other, while maintaining perpendicularity at the surface of each patch. By way of example, FIG. 3 is an exemplary perspective view of six radiating arcs that are generated by a square array of four patches using a differential-mode excitation method according to an embodiment of the invention.",
        "An analysis of the radiation from the semicircular field lines that couple pairs of patches demonstrates that the patches radiate in a manner that differs significantly from the manner in which arrays of uncoupled elements radiate. Indeed, it is to be appreciated that the present invention makes direct and deliberate use of the mutual coupling between patches excited in differential-mode. Such mutual coupling represents the major radiation mechanism, not merely a small correction to the edge radiation of conventional designs. A detailed analysis for determining a radiation pattern emitted by a patch antenna array operating in differential-mode operation is provided below in Section IV. In general, for purposes of analysis, a model of the radiation pattern assumes that the coupling field comprises semicircular arcs and that the field strength along these arcs can be replaced by their average value. The Fourier transform of these assumed fields gives the radiation pattern in any direction. A radiation model according to the invention allows a radiation pattern to be determined efficiently, by reducing the calculation to the solution of a simple, stable recurrence relation.",
        "In general, a patch antenna array using a differential-mode excitation scheme according to the invention provides many features and advantages that can not be obtained with conventional designs using common-mode excitation. For example, broadside radiation (vertically away from the substrate) can be achieved with differential-mode excitation of the patch elements but can not be achieved with common-mode excitation. Further, radiation of the array in a specified direction using differential-mode excitation, does not require the usual progressive phasing of the patches as with common-mode excitation.",
        "Further, several rules that must be applied when designing conventional array antenna do not apply to a differential-mode excitation scheme according to the invention For instance, calculations based on the well-known \u201cspace factor\u201d of phased array antennas for uncoupled, isotropic radiators are generally not applicable in the present invention. Conventionally, a designer of a patch antenna would first design the \u201cspace factor\u201d (the appropriate size, shape, and spacing of the array) to achieve the desired gain and shape of the beam. With respect to beam shape, however, it is to be appreciated that the shape of the patches is not an important consideration in the inventive design using differential-mode excitation. The primary consideration given to the size of the patches of the antenna array operating in differential-mode is for the overall power of the beam, but not the shape of the beam. Rather, as explained in detail below, it is the spacing between the patches that controls the radiation properties.",
        "Other features of an antenna array operating in differential-mode is that radiation intensity varies based on, e.g., the square of the area of all the patches in the array, which is to be contrasted with conventional schemes where the radiation intensity varies based on the area of each patch in the array. Moreover, it is to be appreciated that an antenna array operating in differential-mode according to the invention need not be square and need not be planar. Further, the patches need not even be regularly spaced.",
        "Furthermore, an array of M mutually coupled patches that is excited in differential-mode according to the present invention effectively constitutes a collection of M(M\u22121)/2 radiators, not merely M isolated radiators. For example, an array of 64 patches (e.g., in an 8\u00d78 array) effectively comprises 64\u00d763/2=2,016 patch radiators. Similarly, as depicted in FIG. 3, a square array of 4 patches (a 2\u00d72 array) comprises 4\u00d73/2=6 patch radiators. FIG. 3 illustrates six field lines that couple the 4 patches that are situated at the corners of the array square. Each of these six arcs contributes to the radiation from the array of four patches. Other advantages and features of the invention will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art based on the teachings herein.",
        "II. Systems and Methods for Differential-Mode Excitation of Antenna Array",
        "The present invention provides novel systems and methods for utilizing, designing, and optimizing antenna arrays such as microstrip patch antenna arrays. For differential-mode excitation of an antenna array, various methods described herein provide determination of optimal excitation voltages or currents that are applied to the array to optimize the gain, adjust the shape, and/or steer the radiation beam emitted from a patch antenna array.

        "Various devices and methods according to preferred embodiments of the invention for feeding voltages or currents to patch elements in the antenna array 120, to achieve mutual coupling of the array of patches, will now be discussed with reference to FIGS. 8-11.",
        "FIG. 8 depicts one preferred scheme for feeding a patch, which utilizes a short probe 90 that penetrates into the region above the patch. Preferably, the probe 90 comprises an extended portion of the center conductor of a coaxial line that otherwise terminates under the patch. As depicted, the probe 90 may be centered on the patch and perpendicular to the plane of the patch. The probe 90 is thin, of radius ao and short, of length lo and is excited by current Im for patch m. The current enters the probe from below the patch, and the entry point constitutes one of the \u201cports\u201d of the \u201ccircuit\u201d. The probe current excites a vertically oriented electric field in the space above the patch. That field can couple one patch to another.",

Preferably, the loop 91 comprises an extended center conductor of a coaxial line that is formed into a loop of suitable size in the air space above the patch and ends on the patch. The loop can have any convenient shape, not necessarily semicircular. The loop current excites a horizontally oriented magnetic field in the space above the patch, which field can couple one patch to another.",
        "FIG. 10 depicts other preferred feed schemes, wherein a patch may comprise any one of the illustrated small apertures, designed in accordance with Bethe hole coupling theory, which allow excitation fields under the patch to penetrate to the outer surface. More specifically, one or more holes in the patch, of suitably chosen shapes, allow fields within a suitable structure below the patch, such as a waveguide, to penetrate to the air space above the patch and excite the desired fields, in the desired phase relationship. These fields can couple one patch to another. The design of an excitation scheme of this type can be guided by well known Bethe hole or aperture coupling theory (see, e.g., D. M. Pozar, Microwave Engineering, Addison-Wesley Publ. Co., 1990; and R. E. Collin, Field Theory of Guided Waves, McGraw-Hill, 1960).",
        "FIG. 11 depicts another scheme that may be implemented for feeding excitation voltages or currents to a patch antenna array. In this embodiment, coaxial line feeds (\u201ccoax\u201d) supply the voltages or currents to each patch, as shown in FIG. 11. In such a manner, each patch is its own output port. Instead of applying voltages between patches (which may be done in another embodiment), a connection would be made from the approximate center conductor of a coax to the underside of each patch to deliver the required RF voltage or current. The connection points are centered under each patch, and the outer conductor of each coax is grounded. An array of M patches then has M input ports with which to feed the array.",
        "With the coax outer conductor reaching almost to the patch, any radiation from the open end of the coax is effectively shielded from the outer space above the patches. The feed lines are shielded by the coaxial lines. The antenna radiation will come nearly exclusively from the upper sides of the patches.",
        "A method according to one aspect of the invention for feeding the input ports at the free ends of the coaxial lines will now be described. First, the incident wave amplitudes at each input port, Port 1, Port 2, . . . Port M is determined in terms of the voltages that are required based on the design criteria according to the invention as described herein. At the output ports (i.e., the connections to the patches), the incident and reflected wave amplitudes are listed in the M-dimensional vectors a, b. The reflected wave amplitudes are expressible in terms of the incident ones by the scattering matrix S, as b=S a. If a \u201ctrue\u201d scattering matrix is available, either at the output ports or at the input ports, then such matrix should be used. However, if such matrix is not available, then an approximation can be made by constructing the output-port scattering matrix in terms of the mutual capacitance matrix C from equations (1)-(2) in section IV below, for just two patches. Since a+b=V (the voltage vector at the patches), and since a\u2212b is proportional to the currents fed to them, we have a\u2212b=j\u03c9ZoC (a+b) or (I\u2212j\u03c9ZoC)a=(I+j\u03c9ZoC)b, where I is the m\u00d7m unit matrix, and Zo is the characteristic impedance of each coax.",
        "Thus, the approximate scattering matrix is S=(I+j\u03c9ZoC)\u22121(I\u2212j\u03c9ZoC). The incident wave amplitudes evaluated at the output ports are then a=(I+S)\u22121V, and the incident wave amplitudes required at the input ports to deliver the desired voltages V at the output ports (patches) are listed in the vector A, given by A=exp(j\u03c6)(I+S)\u22121V, where \u03c6 is the total phase shift along the coaxial line. Of course, if the coaxial lines are of different lengths, the exponential phase factor becomes a diagonal matrix instead of a scalar. As an example, the length of a coaxial line may be approximately \u00bd wavelength in size.",
        "IV. Analysis of Radiation of Patch Antenna Array in Differential-Mode Operation",
        "The following section provides a detailed discussion of a method for determining the radiation from an array of patch antennas in differential-mode operation. We develop a model for the field structure in the air space above the patch antenna array when unequal voltages are applied to two or more patches (although it is to be understood that the model described herein is equally applicable for determining the field structure when differential currents are used). As is well known by those of ordinary skill in the art, fields in confined spaces shielded from the outer region are relatively easy to calculate, but we are dealing here with fields in an open structure, which are generally more difficult to compute. We therefore resort to an approximation to the true field pattern, one that conforms to the most important boundary conditions that apply, but that does not account fully for all the fringing that actually occurs. Because of variational principles, the radiation pattern we calculate from these approximate fields is nevertheless more accurate than is the assumed field pattern itself. Indeed, such calculation permits a useful assessment of the radiation from an array of patch antennas operated in differential-mode.",
        "As explained above, FIG. 2 illustrates the postulated field structure from two patch antenna elements on a substrate. FIG. 2 depicts two patch antenna elements deposited on a dielectric substrate that separates the antenna elements from a conducting ground plane. The outer region is air. The two antenna elements have unequal voltages V1 and V2 applied to them. These voltages charge up the elements and an electric field pattern is generated. In the substrate, the fields under the elements are virtually uniform. Within the substrate and beyond the edges of the elements, there are fringing fields but with the assumed field structure, the fringing fields at the edges of the patches are neglected. But the semicircular field lines that couple the patches through the air are the fields that are considered. Although FIG. 2 does not show the fringing fields, such fields exist, as there can not be any discontinuity in the vertical electric field as we move across the region from below an element to between elements. If the substrate is not excessively thick, the effects of the fringing fields are secondary to those of the fields below the elements. The charges on the elements are not confined to the lower surface, however, but distribute themselves on the upper surface as well. When the voltages are not the same, the resultant electric fields in the air run from one conducting element to the other and such fields begin and end perpendicular to the conducting elements.",
        "The field lines in the air trace out some arc from one element to the other, starting and ending vertically, but we can know the precise shape of these arcs only by solving the exterior boundary value problem, which is inherently difficult. Generally, in accordance with the invention, a physically reasonable shape for the field lines in the air is first assumed and then the consequent field strengths are developed on that approximate basis. We retain the all-important requirement of field lines perpendicular to each element at the surface and assume the arc from one element to the other is simply a semicircle. Furthermore, to simplify the subsequent calculations, we also assume that the field strength along any one such semicircular arc is a constant, determined by the voltage difference between the two elements. We neglect fringing fields beyond the edges of the elements, this time within the outer air region, so that we are again ignoring apparent discontinuities in the tangential electric fields beyond the last arcs of the assumed semicircular field lines. With the above approximations, we can proceed to compute the radiation from the antenna elements when these are excited by unequal voltages that oscillate at some given carrier frequency.",
        "Let's assume that the substrate thickness is h, then the electric field strength in the substrate under the first element is E1=V1/h and the electric field strength in the substrate under the second element is E2=V2/h. The field strength along a particular field line in the air in this model is give by E(r)=(V1\u2212V2/\u03c0r, where r denotes the radius of the semicircle. The radius depends on the locations of the two ends of the field line, and is approximately half the geometric separation of the two elements. There is zero field strength in the outer region if the applied voltages are the same, but there will be a nonzero field in the air space whenever differential-mode excitation is applied. FIG. 2 shows orientations of the electric fields appropriate for the case where V1>V2>0, but the calculation is valid for any pair of voltages.",
        "We can immediately obtain expressions for the self and mutual capacitances of the pair of patches in this model. Assuming the substrate has a permittivity \u03b5 and both patches have area A, the charge on the lower surface of the first patch is A\u03b5E1=(\u03b5A/h)V1 and the charge on the lower surface of the first patch is A\u03b5E2=(\u03b5A/h)V2. The charge density on the upper surface of the first patch is (\u03b5o/\u03c0r)(V1\u2212V2), and the charge density on the upper surface of the second patch has an equal and opposite charge per unit area. To simplify the remaining calculation, we assume that the size of each patch is small compared to the relevant radii of the semicircles. Thus, we can then reduce the necessary integrals of 1/r over the patches to the average of 1/r times the patch area A and replace r with an average value. In view of the approximations adopting semicircular field lines, it would be a futile exercise to refine the use of the average radius to the more precise integration of 1/r. Therefore, we accept half the geometric separation between the patches as the average radius. Consequently, the total charge on the two patches is given by:",

The radiation pattern is obtained from this in terms of the magnitude squared of the part of the radiation vector that is perpendicular to {circumflex over (n)}.

For theoretical purposes, J(a, b) can be expressed via a Fourier series as an infinite series of Bessel functions or, alternatively by expanding the integrand in a Taylor series, in terms of beta functions.

The parameter kr=\u03c0d/\u03bb in both a and b involves the ratio of the separation d between the two patches (the diameter of the semicircle) to the wavelength \u03bb.",
        "FIGS. 12, 13 and 14 are diagrams of polar plots, in two planes, illustrating calculated radiation patterns for a semicircular current in free space, for three different values of a separation-to-wavelength ratio d/\u03bb. More specifically, FIGS. 12a and 12b illustrate radiation patterns for the longitudinal vertical plane and transverse vertical plane, respectively, for a pair of patches \u00bc wavelength apart. FIGS. 13a and 13b illustrate radiation patterns for the longitudinal vertical plane and transverse vertical plane, respectively, for a pair of patches 1 wavelength apart. FIGS. 14a and 14b illustrate radiation patterns for the longitudinal vertical plane and transverse vertical plane, respectively, for a pair of patches 1.3 wavelengths apart.",
        "The longitudinal vertical plane is the plane of the semicircle and includes the locations of the two patches, and this is the plane formed by the unit vectors \u015d and {circumflex over (z)}. The transverse vertical plane bisects the line from one patch to the other, and it includes {circumflex over (z)} but is perpendicular to \u015d. Each plot depicted in FIGS. 12-14 shows two tracings of the radiation pattern: the inner tracing is a linear plot and the outer tracing is logarithmic, in dB. For convenience in plotting, both have been scaled to the same peak value. The legends indicate the patch separation in wavelengths and also furnish the peak value of |G\u22a5|2 in dB, as well as the ratio of the maximum to the minimum value of the pattern, in dB.",
        "It is to be noted that that neither the substrate nor the ground plane is included in the calculation of these patterns. Their effects are dealt with later, using these results as incident fields. The present patterns furnish the radiation from semicircular uniform currents in empty space.",
        "Besides the cases depicted in the figures, additional calculations confirm that for small separations of the patches, the radiation pattern reverts to that for a horizontally oriented dipole, with a null in the direction of the pair of patches and an isotropic pattern in the transverse plane, as may be expected. We also find that, for a patch separation of 0.6 wavelengths, the radiation pattern is nearly isotropic, to within a fraction of a dB, in both planes. For large separations, the pattern becomes more scalloped.",
        "We can now extend these results for a single pair of patches with unequal excitations to an array of patches with differential-mode excitation. Consider an array of M patches, each patch having an area A. It is to be understood that it is not necessary for the patches to be distributed in space systematically, although a uniformly spaced array in the plane atop the substrate may be a practical implementation. The p-th patch is located at rp and is excited by complex voltage Vp. Any pair of these patches, identified by p and q, results in a semicircular displacement current in our model, from patch p to patch q, provided that Vp\u2260Vq. The center of the semicircular arc is at rpq=(rp+rq)/2 and this introduces a phase factor exp(jk\u00b7rpq) into the expression for the radiation vector for this pair of elements. We need to sum over all pairs of patches to get the overall radiation vector. There are M(M\u22121)/2 distinct pairs. For example, for a 5\u00d75 array of 25 elements, there are 300 radiating semicircular arcs. To handle this multiplicity of radiators efficiently, we resort of course to a matrix description.",

        "It is to be noted that MA is the total geometrical area of the patches, excluding the spacing between them. The real scalar factor, F=VQQ\u2032V\u2032/VV\u2032, carries the directional information and gives the pattern as a homogeneous expression in the excitations V (unaffected by any common factors in the elements of V). For any given excitations, F gives the radiation in any direction for which Q has been calculated.",
        "The expression for F is also variational, in that it becomes stationary when V\u2032 is an eigenvector of the hermitian matrix QQ\u2032 (with F as the eigenvalue). We can therefore maximize the radiation in some direction for which Q has been calculated by choosing the excitations V so as to make it the row eigenvector of QQ\u2032 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. Although QQ\u2032 is an Mx\u00d7M matrix, there is no difficulty in obtaining the eigenvalues, as the nonzero eigenvalues are the same as those of Q\u2032Q, which is merely 2\u00d72. The corresponding M-component row eigenvector V of the M\u00d7M matrix QQ\u2032 is just the 2-component eigenvector of the 2\u00d72 matrix Q\u2032Q, postmultiplied by the 2\u00d7M matrix Q\u2032.",
        "Again it is to be understood that although the above exemplary analysis and methods are described for differential-mode voltages, those of ordinary skill in the art can readily apply such analysis and methods for differential-mode currents based on the teachings herein.",
        "FIG. 15a is an exemplary diagram illustrating a radiation pattern in a vertical plane calculated in this manner for a 4\u00d74 square patch antenna array in free space. The patches are separated by 0.6\u03bb along both the x- and y-directions. With 16 patches, there are 16\u00d715/2=120 semicircular arcs in the model and the QQ\u2032 matrix is 16\u00d716, but its nonzero eigenvalues are the same as those of the 2\u00d72 matrix Q\u2032Q. For this example, we have chosen to maximize the radiation intensity obtainable in a direction given by an elevation angle of 15 degrees from the zenith and an azimuthal angle of 15 degrees from the x-axis (which is along one side of the square array). Note that this condition by itself does not place the maximum radiation intensity in that direction (the peak is actually at about 32 degrees), but it furnishes the most intensity obtainable in that direction for any possible set of the 16 complex excitations of the patches. In FIG. 15a, the inner radiation plot is linear and the outer radiation plot is in dB. The tic marks on the frame of the plot are spaced 10 dB apart. The pattern is in a vertical plane that includes the direction of maximization. The substrate and ground plane are omitted from the model, so that the array is assumed to be in empty space.",
        "FIG. 15b is an exemplary diagram illustrating a radiation pattern in a vertical planes for a 4\u00d74 array of uncoupled isotropic radiators, in free space. FIG. 15b is presented for comparison with FIG. 15a, using the same 4\u00d74 array with the same spacing and phased to aim the beam in the same direction. The sidelobes are evident in the outer, dB plot. There are two main beams, because this array is deemed to lie in a plane in empty space. That symmetry is lacking in the case of the patch antenna array, as the semicircular arcs in the mode are considered to extend only on one side of the plane.",
        "In conclusion, radiation from a patch antenna array of two or more elements emanates not merely from the edges of the patches, as is the common presumption, but from the coupling fields that join any pair of patches for which the voltages applied to the elements differ. These coupling fields in the air above the patches oscillate in time and therefore constitute displacement currents that radiate outwards into space. These fields arc from one patch to another, necessarily beginning and ending perpendicular to the conducting patch surfaces.",
        "As a convenient approximation, we assume that the arcs are semicircles and that the field strength along these arcs can be replaced by their average value. The Fourier transform of these assumed fields gives the radiation pattern in any direction. For any array so modeled, we have succeeded in calculating the radiation pattern efficiently, by reducing the calculation to the solution of a simple, stable recurrence relation.",
        "We have presented radiation patterns of pairs of patches with various separations and also of an array of 16 patches. The radiation intensity varies as the fourth power of the linear dimension of the array or of the number of elements on a side of the array. We have given the formula for the radiation pattern in a form that exhibits variational properties and separates the dependence on the patch excitation voltages from its variation with direction. The array need not be square or even regularly spaced.",
        "We have presented the simplest results, for semicircular coupling fields that exist in empty space, without accounting for the dielectric substrate and for the ground plane. The ground plane is easily included by using image semicircular arcs. The dielectric substrate can be accounted for by an application of the equivalence principle to reduce the inhomogeneous problem to two separate but linked homogeneous problems. The form of the equation for the radiation pattern is well suited to the determination of optimized excitation voltages to achieve some beam shaping. We can account for the ground plane and for the substrate, and can impose nulls or otherwise shape the radiation, and the methods apply to irregularly spaced arrays.",
