Parts of the antenna structure on both sides of one end of the aperture are coupled to a wireless communication device, such as an RFID chip or strap. On the opposite end of the aperture, parts of the antenna structure at both sides of the aperture are electrically coupled together, for instance by being coupled together by other conductive parts of the antenna structure. All of the parts of the antenna structure may be parts of a continuous unitary layer of conductive material. The antenna structure with the aperture therein may facilitate increased readability of the RFID device, particularly in directions out from the edges of the RFID device. The antenna structure may be directly conductively coupled to the wireless communication device. Alternatively, the antenna structure may be indirectly (reactively) coupled to the RFID device, such as by capacitive coupling.",

The RFID strap 16 includes conductive leads 20 and 22 that are coupled to arms or parts 26 and 28 of the antenna structure 12.",
        "The standard elements of the interposer or strap 16 include the RFID chip 14 and conductive leads. The interposer or strap 16 also may include a substrate to support the RFID chip 14 and the conductive leads. In most embodiments herein (e.g. FIGS. 2 and 3) there is no substrate, but rather the conductive leads and the chip 14 are supported by the antenna. In the embodiments of FIGS. 10A and 11A (discussed below), the interposer substrate is the same as the antenna substrate. In another possible variation, the RFID chip and the conductive leads may be supported by a separate substrate for processing purposes, and this separate substrate may remain with the chip and leads after the chip and leads are coupled to the antenna, or may be removed.",
        "The arms 26 and 28 are on either side of an aperture or elongated slot 30, an opening between the parts of the antenna structure 12. At a first end 32 of the aperture or elongated slot 30, an open end, the arms 26 and 28 are electrically coupled to the conductive leads 20 and 22 of the RFID interposer or strap 16. The conductive leads 20 and 22 are in turn coupled to contact points of the RFID chip 14. At a second end 36 of the aperture or slot 30, a closed end that is distal relative to the RFID interposer or strap 16, the arms 26 and 28 are electrically connected together, for example by linked together by a conductive connection 38 that is also part of the antenna structure 12.

The slot 30 may have a length from of approximately one quarter of a wavelength of radiation used to communicate with the RFID chip 14. The slot 30 allows the RFID device 10 to be read along a narrow axis 46. Indeed, the RFID device 10 may exhibit good readability characteristics in substantially any direction within or parallel to the plane of the antenna structure 12 or the RFID device 10 as a whole.",
        "In addition, at short ranges, the RFID device 10 demonstrates good read performance in other directions, such as above and below the tag. Thus the RFID device 10 shows good read performance in all directions around the device 10. The read performance of the RFID device 10 is good even when the device 10 is of a small size. For example, an RFID device of the configuration shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, having outer dimensions of 25 mm\u00d725 mm (1 inch\u00d71 inch) has been found to have good read performance at distances in excess of 2 m (6.5 feet), when utilizing suitable power and frequency levels. Examples of suitable power and frequency labels are operation over a frequency band of 902 to 928 MHz at a power of 4 W e.i.r.p (effective isotropic radiated power) in accordance with FCC part 15 section 247. By using a suitable reader with either a circularized polarized antenna, or dual linear antennas polarized at 90 degrees to each other connected to separate ports on a reader system which are alternately switched, the antenna structure 12 gives a read capability that is good over a wide variety of orientations, and may be substantially orientation independent.",

Several configurations of reactive coupling connections are discussed below with regard to different embodiments of the RFID device 10. With regard to the direct (conductive) electrical connections between the conductive leads 20 and 22, and the arms 26 and 28, such connections may be made by use of a suitable conductive adhesive.",

Thus, in contrast to a standard slot antenna, there is not conductive material fully around the slot 30. A standard slot antenna has a short circuit of conductive material fully surrounding a slot.",
        "The antenna structure 12 of the RFID device 10 may have some features of loop antennas, and may have some features of slot antennas, while overcoming the null spots that may occur in traditional loop antennas and slot antennas.

For example, the conductive layer 40 may be a conductive ink, such as an ink containing metal particles, that is printed onto the substrate 42 in a suitable pattern. Alternatively, the conductive layer 40 may be plated onto the substrate 42, such as by electroplating. As another alternative, the conductive layer 40 may be adhesively adhered to the substrate 42. Etching may be used to remove conductive material to form the slot 30.",

Alternatively, the slot may have another shape, such as bent or curved.",
        "FIG. 4 shows one alternative configuration for the RFID device 10, in which the slot 30 has a bent shape, with a number of constant-width segments 60, 62, 64, and 68, angled with regard to one another. The segments 60-68 allow the same overall slot length on a small, more compact device. An RFID interposer 16 is mounted onto both sides of the aperture or slot 30, thus using material of the conductive layer on both sides of the slot 30 and along a distal end of the elongated slot as a hybrid loop-slot antenna, similar to the above-discussed embodiment of the RFID device 10 shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. The conductive layer 40 covers substantially all of an underlying substrate 42, with an exception of the slot 30.",
        "Turning now to FIG. 5, another embodiment of the RFID device 10 is shown, in which the arms 26 and 28 are not directly electrically coupled to one another. Rather the arms 26 and 28 are reactively coupled together by respective coupling portions 76 and 78 of the arms 26 and 28, that are capacitively coupled together across an interaction region 80 of the substrate 42 upon which the conductive arms 26 and 28 are mounted. The interaction region 80 and the slot 30 are to some extent separate, although it will be appreciated that the interaction region 80 may be taken into account when properly tuning the antenna structure 12 by tuning the arms 26 and 28 in the vicinity of the slot 30.",

The dipole element 96 has a serpentine shape, with a number of back-and-forth segments 102. The antenna structure 12 thus utilizes the hybrid loop-slot antenna as a ground plane for the folded dipole element 96. The antenna structure 12 is thus a dual polarization antenna.",
        "FIG. 7-14 show various embodiments of the RFID device 10 that have capacitive coupling between the RFID chip 14 and at least one of the arms 26 and 28. Referring first to the embodiment of the RFID device 10 shown in FIGS. 7-9, the conductive leads 20 and 22 of the RFID interposer 16 are adhesively coupled to the arms 26 and 28 of the antenna structure 12 by respective adhesive pads or layers 110 and 112. The adhesive pads 110 and 112 are made from a non-conductive adhesive that prevents direct (conductive) electrical coupling between the conductive leads 20 and 22, and the arms 26 and 28. Rather, the conductive leads 20 and 22 are capacatively coupled to the arms 26 and 28 across the non-conductive adhesive pads 110 and 112. By avoiding direct conductive electrical coupling between the conductive leads 20 and 22, and the arms 26 and 28, shorting together of the corresponding contact points of the RFID chip 14 is avoided. As noted above, some chips may require that the contact points not be shorted together, for the chips to operate properly.",
        "It will be appreciated that a suitable thickness may be selected for the adhesive pads 110 and 112, in order to provide the desired capacitive coupling between the conductive leads 20 and 22, and the arms 26 and 28. The thickness of the adhesive pads may be selected based on such factors as the operating power and frequency, the coupling area, and the dielectric constant of the adhesive to be used. In one example, adhesive pads having an area of 5 mm2 and a thickness of 10 \u03bcm may be used, although it will be appreciated that a wide range of suitable areas and thicknesses may be used.",

As shown in FIG. 10A, different parts of the device 10 are formed on different parts 120 and 122 of a substrate 124. The parts 120 and 122 have a fold line 126 therebetween. On the first part 120 the RFID interposer 16 is placed, with the conductive leads 20 and 22 face up. The RFID interposer 16 may be attached to the first part 120 of the substrate 124 by use of a suitable adhesive. Alternatively, the interposer 16 may be formed in situ, by depositing or forming the conductive leads 20 and 22, such as by printing or electroplating, after placing the RFID chip 14 face up on the first part 120.",

        "Following making of the structure shown in FIG. 10A, the two parts of the device are joined together by folding the substrate 124 along the fold line 126. This brings in conductive leads 20 and 22 into contact with the adhesive pads 110 and 112, thereby adhesively joining together the conductive leads 20 and 22 to the arms 26 and 28, as illustrated in FIG. 10B.",
        "The first part 120 of the substrate 124 may be sized to substantially cover the second part 122, when the first part 120 is folded over the second part 122. The second part 122 may be pressed against and sealed to the second parts, such as by heat sealing, to enclose and protect the operative elements of the device 10.",
        "It will be appreciated that the method of making an RFID device, as illustrated in FIGS. 10A and 10B, may be performed as a series of continuous roll operations, such as in a roll-to-roll process. The placement of the RFID chip 14 and/or the interposer 16; the formation of the antenna structure 12 on the substrate 124 (or adherence of the antenna structure 12 to the substrate 124); and/or placement of the adhesive pads 110 and 112, all may be performed as roll operations. Such operations may be performed on a web of material, which may then be suitably cut to produce individual RFID devices.",
        "It will be further appreciated that the sort of method described above may be utilized with RFID devices having other configurations, as described herein. For example, suitable electrically-conductive adhesive may be substituted for non-conductive adhesive of the adhesive pads 110 and 112, thereby producing an RFID device 10 where the conductive leads 20 and 22 are directly (conductively) electrically coupled to the arms 26 and 28 of the antenna structure 12.

The fingers 144 interdigitate with corresponding fingers 146 of the arm 26, leaving a narrow serpentine gap 150 between the sets of fingers 144 and 146. Capacitive coupling may occur across the gap 150, indirectly (capacitively) electrically coupling the conductive pad 142 and the arm 26, without danger of short-circuiting of the arm 26.

This wavelength may be more particularly taken to be that of the energy most preferentially received by the RFID device 10 (the wavelength the RFID device 10 is tuned for). The RFID device 10 may be almost in contact with the conductive material 302, so that there is substantially no separation between the RFID device 10 and the conductive material 302.",

This is in contrast to prior art use of conductive \u201creflectors\u201d located a quarter wavelength away from antennas, which are used to increase gain in such antennas. Performance with such reflectors is not enhanced when the antenna is brought closer than a quarter wavelength to the reflector. Although such reflectors utilize a conductive material to increase gain, the reflectors have a completely different mode of operation than the systems described herein.",

Smaller RFID devices 10 are desirable from a number of standpoints: smaller RFID devices require less raw materials, which may reduce costs; and smaller RFID devices require less space to affix to an object, are loss obtrusive, and are less likely to be damaged. In addition, smaller RFID devices may be less detectable after purchase by the end user, when the RFID device 10 is no longer in close proximity to other such devices. The reduced detectability of a separated RFID device (not in close proximity to other devices) may allay privacy concerns concerning RFID devices.",

For example, a number of similar items, each with an RFID device, may be placed in close proximity to one another, enhancing performance of at least some of the RFID devices, above and beyond the performance enhancement that may be obtained by close proximity of electrically-conductive material. Generally it is observed in the case of RFID devices with hybrid antennas (combining characteristics of slot or notch antennas with characteristics of loop antennas) that the enhancement of performance is most pronounced if the tags are in close proximity, and are coplanar.",
        "This performance enhancement in grouping of tagged items may be employed to advantage in the RFID tagging of packaged articles. FIGS. 22A-22E illustrate this effect in a variety of configurations of RFID-tagged, packed bottles 330, with RFID devices 10 in close proximity to one another. In FIG. 22A the bottles 330 are tagged at their the bottom surfaces 332 with RFID devices 10, wherein packing the bottles 330 on a common surface results in roughly co-planar placement of the RFID devices 10. FIG. 22B shows multiple layers of tagged bottles 330 separated by packing sheets 336, resulting in a series of co-planar groups of RFID devices (horizontal planes at different packing levels). In FIG. 22C, the RFID devices 10 are applied to plastic bottle caps 340 instead of to the bottoms of the bottles. Placement of the RFID devices 10 on the bottle caps 340 may be desirable for bottles containing liquids, in order to provide greater distance of the RFID device 10 from the liquid. In FIGS. 22D and 22E the bottles 330 are tagged at their sidewalls 350. For bottles 330 with cylindrical shapes 352 (FIG. 22D), this may result in less consistency in co-planarity of groups of tags because of variations in orientation from bottle to bottle. For bottles 300 with flat faces 354 and natural orientations, such as rectangular cross sections 358 (FIG. 22E), it is easier to assure co-planarity of the RFID devices 10.",
        "FIGS. 22A-22E show RFID devices 10 placed on bottles 300. However, it will be appreciated that the bottles 330 are merely examples of a larger group of objects that may have RFID devices 10 attached to or mounted thereupon.",
        "FIGS. 22F and 22G illustrate another way of enhancing performance of an RFID device 10 by placement of electrically-conductive material in close proximity to the RFID device 10. FIG. 22F shows an RFID device 10 in a container 368, partially overlapped by an object (a CD or DVD) 370 that contains a conductive material 372, thereby forming an RFID system 364. The conductive material 372 may be near or in close proximity to the RFID device 10.",
        "FIG. 22G shows the container 368 with the object 370 removed. The presence of the conductive material 372 partially overlapping conductive material of the RFID device 10, and near or in close proximity to the RFID device 10, enhances performance of the RFID device 10. The presence of the conductive material 372 may enhance the read distance of the RFID device 10 (distance at which a specified signal strength is obtained) by a factor of 3 or a factor of 5 or more.",
        "It will be appreciated that enhancement of performance provided by the partial overlapping of the RFID device 10 may be utilized in any of a number of ways. Most obviously, the enhanced performance may be used to communicate with the RFID device 10 at a greater distance. Another use may be as a theft detection device, which may be used to indicate when the object 370 is removed from the container 368. Such a function may also be performed by a pair of RFID devices, only one of which is partially overlapped for the by the conductive material 372 (or which are subject to different amounts of overlap). When signals of similar intensity are received from both the RFID devices, it indicates that the object 370 has been removed from the container 368. It will be obvious that there are many other uses enhanced performance provided by partial overlapping of RFID devices with conductive material.",
        "FIG. 22H illustrates another configuration, in which the object 370, when present, covers one of a pair of RFID devices 10 and 10\u2032 that share a common antenna structure 12. With the object 370 in place, the device 10\u2032 cannot be read due to the presence of the conductive material 372 covering the slot 30\u2032. In contrast, the slot 30 is always uncovered, so that the device 10 may always be read or otherwise communicated with. When the object 370 is removed, both of the devices 10 and 10\u2032 may be read.",
        "FIGS. 22I and 22J show still another configuration, in which an RFID device 10 within a package 376 on a surface of a keg 378. The package 376, shown in greater detail in FIG. 22K, locates the RFID device 10 within a triangular structure 380, so that it is substantially perpendicular to the surface of the keg 378. The small device size that may be used in such a configuration may aid in avoiding interference with cleaning and filling operations of the keg 378.",
        "FIGS. 22L and 22M illustrate placement of an RFID device 10 substantially perpendicular to a metal rack 382 that may be used in a retail store, for example for display or items for sale. The device 10 is mounted to the rack 382 by use of a clip 384. Alternatively, an adhesive may be used to mount the RFID device 10 to the metal rack 382. The rack-mounted RFID device 10 may be used to identify storage and display locations within a store or wharehouse.",
        "FIG. 22N shows an RFID device 10 mounted on a tire 390, wherein performance of the RFID device 10 is enhanced by being near a metal wheel 392. The RFID device 10 may be molded into the tire 390 during manufacture of the tire 390. Steel wires or other structures may be added to the tire 390 to protect the RFID device 10 from unwanted flexing. The RFID device 10 may be used in tracking location of the tire, such as for inventory control.",
        "FIG. 22P shows an object 300, having an RFID device 10 attached, that is on a conveyor 394. Metal rollers 396 of the conveyor 394 provide sufficient conductive material near the RFID device 10, in order to significantly enhance readability of the RFID device 10. A configuration such as that shown in FIG. 22N may be especially useful in situations where readability is only important when the object 300 is on the conveyor 394, such as in the process of directing the object 300 to a desired location for shipping.",
        "FIGS. 23-32 show several possible alternative configurations for the antenna structure 12 of the RFID device 10. FIG. 23 shows an antenna structure 12a having a rectangular shape, with a straight slot 30a having a wider portion 400 close to an RFID interposer 16a, and a narrower portion 402 further from the interposer 16a.",
        "FIGS. 24 and 25 show antenna structures 12b and 12c that both have square shapes, with respective diagonal slots 30b and 30c. The slot 30b is a straight slot, running from one corner of the antenna structure 12b, through the center of the structure, and most of the way to the opposite corner. The slot 12c is an angled slot, with a bend 410 at a center of the antenna structure 12c.",
        "FIGS. 26-29 show various antenna structures 12d-12g with non-straight slots 30d-30g. The slot 30d has a pair of curved sections 420 and 422. The slots 30e-30g have various angled bends 426 in them. The antenna structures 12d-12f have a generally circular shape, while the antenna structure 12g has a square shape.",
        "FIG. 30 shows an antenna structure 12h with a square shape, and having a C-shape slot 30h. The slot 30h has a branch 430 is coupled to one of the distal legs 432 of the C-shape slot 30h. The RFID interposer 16 is coupled across the branch 432.",
        "FIG. 31 shows an antenna structure 12i that has a compensation element 440 that aids in compensating for electrical characteristics of nearby objects (e.g., electrical conductive and dielectric constant), so as to provide performance that is less dependent upon the characteristics of nearby objects. Many other sorts of compensation elements are described and illustrated in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/536,483, filed Jan. 20, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
        "FIG. 32 shows an antenna structure 12j that includes a pair of portions 450 and 452 that are separated by a narrow gap 454. The portions 450 and 452 may be capacitively coupled across the gap 454. A straight slot 30j fully separates parts 456 and 458 of the portion 450, and partially bisects the portion 452.",
