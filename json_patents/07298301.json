        "This invention relates to integrated circuits utilized for data processing applications. More particularly, the present invention relates to a data processing circuit and method for serializing data.",
        "Integrated circuits are commonly utilized in digital and mixed signal systems for processing data. For example, integrated circuits typically form the basic building blocks for computer systems, digital data communications systems, and industrial data processing systems as well as other electronic systems. One particular example of a digital data communication system that may benefit from advanced data processing techniques is a telecommunication system such as a serial optical network (\u201cSONET\u201d) system.",
        "The rise of the information age has put ever increasing demands on integrated circuits used to process data. For example, systems previously designed to carry only sound, such as the telephone system, are now being designed to carry digital and mixed signal data between both individual users and large data processing networks such as computer networks. As more users store and communicate data using data networks, more and more data must be processed by the integrated circuits that are used to build the data processing systems. Accordingly, to keep up with the increasing data processing demands, integrated circuits must be designed to process data at ever increasing speeds.",
        "Integrated circuits used for data processing applications commonly require that data from a variety of different data sources be combined and transmitted over a single data line. For example, many systems require that parallel digital data signals be combined and transmitted serially over a single data line to another part of the system. A common circuit used to perform such a task is a serializer or multiplexer.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates a functional diagram of a typical multiplexer commonly used and well known in the art. The multiplexer 100 includes input lines D0 and D1 for receiving data Din0 and Din1, a select line for receiving a select control signal, and an output line. The multiplexer couples only one of the input lines to the output line in accordance with the particular state of the select control signal. For a 2-input multiplexer, the select line may receive a binary logic signal for coupling each of the input lines to the output line.",
        "However, as the speed of data processing systems increases, traditional multiplexer circuits used to serialize data may fail to work effectively. For example, one problem is that the multiplexer circuitry must be designed and timed such the data received on each of the input lines of the multiplexer is available at the output of the multiplexer when the particular input line is selected by the select line. If the timing of the data received on each of the multiplexer inputs and the control signals received on the select line are not precisely controlled, then the output may contain erroneous data, and the system will not work.",
        "Therefore, what is needed is a data processing system and method that can serialize data at very high frequencies. Additionally, what is needed is a synchronous data serialization circuit that can process data from multiple data sources at very high frequencies.",
        "In accordance with the present invention a data processing circuit includes a first data path for processing first data, the first data path including a first data storage circuit, a second data path for processing second data, the second data path including a second data storage circuit, a multiplexer having a first input coupled to the first data path and a second input coupled to the second data path, the multiplexer having a select input coupled to a clock signal, and a delay circuit configured to delay storage of the second data in the second data storage circuit, wherein the first data storage circuit stores the first data in response to receiving a first timing signal, and the second data storage circuit stores the second data in response to receiving a second timing signal.",
        "In one embodiment, the first data storage circuit is a flip-flop that receives and stores the first data in response to a clock signal making a transition in a first direction, such as the rising edge of a clock, for example. Additionally, in one embodiment, the second data storage circuit is a flip-flop that receives and stores the second data in response to a clock signal making a transition in a second direction opposite the first direction, such as the falling edge of a clock, for example.

The outputs of the circuit may be taken at the drains of transistors 601 and 602. Thus, when using a C3MOS logic implementation, it is to be understood that data will be transmitted or received, or both, on a pair of differential data lines. Thus, delay cell 540, receiving Din1, and delay cell 560, receiving CLK, may both receive differential signals when implemented using C3MOS logic. In one embodiment, the delay between the input and output of delay circuit 600 may be less than 1 picosecond. However, the delay of actual implementations may vary with processing. In order to obtain more control over the delay of delay circuit 600, a capacitor array 640 may be used as shown in FIG. 6B. Capacitor array 640 includes first and second capacitors 641 and 642 that are each series connected to switches 643 and 644, respectively. A parallel combination of switched capacitors may be connected between each of the outputs of the delay circuit 600 and ground 610. Thus, the delay time between the input and output of the delay circuit 600 can be varied by selectively activating/deactivating (i.e., ON/OFF) the switches 643 and 644, thereby selectively coupling capacitors 641 and 642 to an output of the delay circuit 600. When one or both of the switches 643 and 644 are switched ON, the capacitance on the output node will increase, and a longer delay will result. Switching the capacitors out of the circuit will correspondingly reduce the delay.",

        "In one embodiment, the present invention may be utilized in a system processing data in the gigahertz range (i.e. above 1 GHz). For instance, one application the present invention may be used in a system that combines C3MOS logic with conventional CMOS logic to achieve an optimum balance between speed and power consumption. According to this embodiment, an integrated circuit utilizes C3MOS logic for the ultra high speed (e.g., GHz) portions of the circuitry, and conventional CMOS logic for the relatively lower speed sections. For example, to enable an integrated circuit to be used in ultra high speed applications, the input and output circuitry that interfaces with and processes the high speed signals is implemented using C3MOS. The circuit also employs C3MOS to divide down the frequency of the signals being processed to a low enough frequency where conventional CMOS logic can be used. The core of the circuit, according to this embodiment, is therefore implemented by conventional CMOS logic that consumes zero static current. FIG. 9 shows a simplified block diagram illustrating this exemplary embodiment of the invention. A C3MOS input circuit 900 receives a high frequency input signal IN and outputs a divided down version of the signal IN/n. The lower frequency signal IN/n is then processes by core circuitry 902 that is implemented in conventional CMOS logic. A synchronous data serialization circuit according to the present invention may then be used in C3MOS output circuit 904 to convert the processed IN/n signal back to the original frequency (or any other desired frequency) before driving it onto the output node OUT.",
        "FIG. 10 shows an exemplary circuit application of the C3MOS/CMOS combined logic wherein C3MOS logic is used to deserialize and serialize the signal stream while CMOS logic is used as the core signal processing logic circuitry. C3MOS input circuitry 1000 is a deserializer that receives a serial bit stream at a high frequency of, for example, 2 GHz. A 2 GHz input clock signal CLK is divided down to 1 GHz using a C3MOS flip-flop 1002, such as the one shown in FIG. 7, that is connected in a \u00f72 feedback configuration. The 1 GHz output of flip-flop 1002 is then supplied to clock inputs of a pair of C3MOS latches 1004 and 1006. Latches 1004 and 1006 receive the 2 GHz input bit stream at their inputs and respectively sample the rising and falling edges of the input bit stream in response to the 1 GHz clock signal CLK/2. The signal CLK/2 which is applied to the inputs of each latch, samples the input data preferably at its center. It is to be noted that the rise and fall times of the signal in CMOS logic is often very dependent on process variations and device matching. C3MOS logic, on the other hand, is differential in nature and therefore provides much improved margins for sampling.",
        "Referring again to FIG. 10, block 1000 thus deserializes the input bit stream with its frequency halved to allow for the use of conventional CMOS logic to process the signals. The signals at the outputs of latches 1004 and 1006 are applied to parallel processing circuitry 1008 that are implemented in conventional CMOS logic operating at 1 GHz. The reverse is performed at the output. Thus, a serializer 1010 according to the present invention may receive the output signals from processing circuitry 1008 and serializes them using C3MOS logic. The final output signal is a bit stream with the original 2 GHz frequency. Circuit applications wherein this technique can advantageously be employed include high speed single or multi-channel serial links in communication systems.",
        "As apparent from the circuit shown in FIG. 10, this technique doubles the amount of the core signal processing circuitry. However, since this part of the circuit is implemented in conventional CMOS logic, current dissipation is not increased by the doubling of the circuitry. Those skilled in the art appreciate that there can be more than one level of deserializing and serializing if further reduction in operating frequency is desired. That is, the frequency of the input signal can be divided down further by 4 or 8 or more if desired, and then later recombined using the serializer techniques of the present invention. As each resulting bit stream will require its own signal processing circuitry, the amount and size of the overall circuitry increases in direct proportion to the number by which the input signal frequency is divided. For each application, therefore, there is an optimum number depending on the speed, power and area requirements.",
        "FIG. 11 is a simplified block diagram of a tranceiver system that utilizes C3MOS/CMOS combined logic to facilitate interconnecting high speed fiber optic communication channels. The exemplary tranceiver of FIG. 11 is typically found along fiber optic channels in high speed telecommunication networks. The tranceiver includes at its input an optical input system 1100 such as, for example, a photo detect and driver circuit that receives the input signal from the fiber optic channel. Circuit 1100 converts fiber-optic signal to packets of data and supplies it to a clock data recovery (CDR) circuit 1102. CDR circuit 1102 recovers the clock and data signals that may be in the frequency range of about 2.5 GHz. Established telecommunication standards require the tranceiver to perform various functions, including data monitoring and error correction. These functions are performed at a lower frequency. Thus, the tranceiver uses a demultiplexer 1104 which deserializes the 2.5 GHz data stream into, for example, 16 parallel signals having a frequency of about 115 MHz. An application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) 1106 then performs the monitoring and error correction functions at the lower (115 MHz) frequency. The present invention may then be utilized to implement a multiplexer and clock multiplication unit (CMU) 1108 to convert the parallel signals back into a single bit stream at 2.5 GHz. This signal is then coupled to an optical output system 1112 that retransmits the data back onto the fiber optic channel by a laser driver, for example. The combined C3MOS/CMOS techniques allow demultiplexer 1104, ASIC 1106 and a multiplexer and CMU 1108, which utilizes the present invention, to be fabricated on a single silicon die.",
        "Having fully described several embodiments of the present invention, other equivalent or alternative methods of practicing the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, the polarity of the signals used to control the storing of data bits received and selection of the multiplexer may be modified. Additionally, alternate configurations of the delay cell circuit for delaying the storing of the data in the storage circuit in the second signal path could be used. Furthermore, other clocked data storage circuits structures could be used such as latches, other FF structures, or other forms of regenerative memories. These and other embodiments as well as alternatives and equivalents to the invention will be recognizable to those of skill in the art after reading the description of the present invention. The scope of the invention should not, therefore, be determined solely by reference to the above description, but instead should be determined with reference to the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents and alternatives."
