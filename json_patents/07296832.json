        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to locking mechanisms for doors. More particularly the present invention relates to a locking device adaptable to door hinges which maintain a door in a closed position until the device is removed.",
        "2. General Background",
        "Hinged doors, whether providing ingress and egress between rooms are between the interior and exterior of a building are most often equipped with a lock, which is usually a latch of dead bolt on the door face which engages the edge of the distal edge of the door into the door jam. This is for the most part a universal way of locking doors in the closed orientation.",
        "One shortcoming of such a lock is that the locking device, for the most part, is only as strong as the door jam into which it engages. That is, particularly with exterior doors, if a burglar wishes to enter a locked premises, oftentimes the burglar will place such force between the door and the jam, that the jam with give way, and the lock, of course, is no longer engaged. Because of this prevalent shortcoming, there is a need to provide a lock for a door which will not be necessarily dependent upon the strength of the jam into which the door is closed. Or, there is a need for a secondary locking device which may supplement the usual dead bolt or other standard door lock.",
        "A locking mechanism for door hinge, usually referred to as a butt hinge, of the type securable between a door frame jamb and a door stile, having first and second leaves moveable along a common axis; upper and lower loops formed along the upper and lower edges of the leaf secured to the door frame jamb, the loops extending over the leaf of the door stile when the door is in the closed configuration and the leaves abut one another; and a pin insertable into the upper loop and extending into the lower loop, blocking the movement of the stile leaf when force is placed upon the door in order to attempt to open it, and when the pin is removed, the leaves are free to open. The locking mechanism would be placed on one or more of the hinges of the door.",
        "For a further understanding of the nature, objects, and advantages of the present invention, reference should be had to the following detailed description, read in conjunction with the following drawings, wherein like reference numerals denote like elements and wherein:",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates an overall view of the hinge locking mechanism mounted to an open door; and",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates an overall view of the hinge locking mechanism mounted to a closed door and locked in position.",
        "FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate the preferred embodiment of the present invention by the numeral 10. As illustrated the locking mechanism 10 is incorporated into a standard door hinge 12, which comprises a first leaf 14 mounted on a door frame jamb 16, through a plurality of screws 18 securing the leaf 14 against the jamb 16. There is provided a second leaf 20 secured to the door stile 22 via a plurality of screws 18, the first and second leaves 14, rotatingly mounted to one another via a hinge pin 24 secured through interfitting collars 26 in each leaf 14, 20. This type of hinge is standard in the building industry, and is usually referred to as butt hinge 12. The hinge 12, as seen in the Figures, allows the door 13 to swing between an open position as seen in FIG. 1, where the hinge leaves 14, 20 are exposed, to the closed position as seen in FIG. 2, where the leaves 14, 20 abut one another between the closed door stile 22 and the frame jamb 16. In most cases, the leaves 14, 20 are secured in recessed formed in the stile 22 and jamb 16, so that the door 13, when closed, is able to but up against the frame jamb 16 for a more secure fit.",
        "Reference is now made to the locking mechanism 10 which is an integral part of the modified hinges 12, as seen in FIGS. 1 and 2. As stated earlier, in FIG. 1, the door 13 is in the open position away from the door jamb 16. There is illustrated a loop member 30 secured to the upper edge 17 of the leaf 14 secured to the door jamb 16, having a loop opening 19. The loop member 30 would be integrally secured to the leaf edge 17 via welding or molded in place, and would extend sufficiently out away from the leaf 14, defining an opening 19, for the reasons explained latter. There is also a second loop 32 secured to the lower edge 19 of the leaf 14, which would be vertically aligned with upper loop 30, likewise defining an opening 19, so that a pin 35 may be inserted into the opening 19 of the first loop 30 and extend downward into and through the opening 19 in the second loop 32. There is provided a head 38 on pin 35 which prevents the pin 35 from sliding through the loops 30, 32 when in place, with the head 38 of pin 35 resting on the upper loop 30, as seen in FIG. 2.",
        "Turning now to FIG. 2, the door 13 has been swung closed from its open position in FIG. 1, in the direction of arrow 40, so that the leaves 14, 20 abut one another, in when in that position, the loops 30, 32 have overlapped past the hinge leaf 20, so that the loop openings 19 are accessible for the pin 35 to be inserted. When the pin 35 is inserted in position, as seen in FIG. 2, should one attempt to open the door 13, the pin 35 would prevent the hinge leaves 14, 20 from moving apart, and the door 13 would be in effect, locked closed. Of course, all one must do is remove the pin 35 from loops 30, 32, and the door would be free to open, assuming the door lock is disengaged.",
        "It is foreseen that the locking mechanism described above would be used on at least one hinge 12, but preferably would be used on all of the hinges 12, which serve to lock a door 13 to a door jamb 16 more securely. With a plurality of these locking mechanisms 10 positioned on multiple hinges 12, the integrity of the system would be more assured as a means for locking a door closed. Also, it is foreseen that this locking device could be retrofitted onto existing hinges, through welding the loops 30, 32 to the hinge leaf 14 mounted on the jamb 16, or they could be sold as hinges 12 which are modified with the locking mechanism in place.",
        "It is also understood that this locking device 10 for door hinges 12 could be either the primary or secondary means for locking a door closed; but, would in any even add an additional layer of protection from a closed door being forced open when the door lock is compromised.",
