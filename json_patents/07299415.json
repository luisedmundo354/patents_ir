        "This patent relates generally to computer software, and more particularly, to computer software used in asset management systems to provide help information.",
        "Process plants, like those used in chemical, petroleum or other processes, typically include one or more centralized or decentralized process controllers communicatively coupled to at least one host or operator workstation and to one or more process control and instrumentation devices, such as field devices, via analog, digital or combined analog/digital buses. Field devices, which may be, for example valves, valve positioners, switches, transmitters, and sensors (e.g., temperature, pressure and flow rate sensors), perform functions within the process such as opening or closing valves and measuring process parameters. While a typical process plant has many process control and instrumentation devices, such as valves, transmitters, sensors, etc. connected to one or more process controllers which execute software that controls these devices during the operation of the process, there are many other supporting devices which are also necessary for or related to process operation.",
        "Still further, many process plants have other computers associated therewith which execute applications related to business functions or maintenance functions. Many process plants, and especially those which use smart field devices, use asset management applications to help monitor, track, and maintain the devices within the plant regardless of whether these devices are process control and instrumentation devices or are other types of devices. For example, an Asset Management Solutions (AMS) application sold by Fisher-Rosemount Systems, Inc. enables communication with and stores data pertaining to field devices to ascertain and track the operating state of various field devices. An example of such a system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,960,214 entitled \u201cIntegrated Communication Network for use in a Field Device Management System.\u201d",
        "Maintenance personnel who are primarily responsible for ensuring that the actual equipment within the process is operating efficiently and for repairing and replacing malfunctioning equipment, use tools such as maintenance interfaces, the AMS application discussed above, and many other diagnostic tools which provide information about operating states of the devices within the process. To maintain information about various field devices in a process control system, the AMS application maintains a database of information about a number of devices. Generally, various devices used in a process control system can be expected to be manufactured by a number of different manufacturers. It is quite likely that not all of the devices communicate with each other or with the process control devices in the same manner. To overcome the problem of incompatibility among devices manufactured by different manufacturers, the process instrumentation industry uses a standardized digital device communications protocol as defined by a foundation such as the HART Foundation, or the Fieldbus Foundation in order to allow a single application to communicate with multiple device types. Typically, these foundations will have a standard that defines how each device identifies itself to a process control system using a standard communication protocol and a device description (DD), where the DD defines the protocol's application layer and various user interface definitions necessary to communicate with the device. Each device type would typically have its own DD, which is a formal description of the data and operating procedures for a field device, including variables, methods, commands, menus and display formats associated with the device. Information about every accessible variable of the device is included in the DD. Such variables include, for example, process measurements, any derived values, and all the internal parameters such as range, sensor type, choice of linearization, materials of construction, etc.",
        "When the AMS application is implemented in a process plant that uses such a device, the maintenance personal responsible for maintaining up to date device related information may need to get help information about various parameters used to describe such a device. System designers using the AMS software, the 375 Communicator or the HART communicator may use a DD to gain further information about a device. As per the FOUNDATION Fieldbus' or the HART Communication Foundation's DD Language, all HART devices have the option to include DD help text to explain each parameter, method, etc., defined for a specific device. Such DD help text can be displayed on applications such as 275 HART Communicator, AMS, etc. However, not all device manufacturers provide DD help for all parameters, and if they do, this help information is generally not very descriptive. Moreover, DD help provided by a device manufacturer is limited to text information only, i.e., it does not include images, sound, etc.",

In a preferred embodiment, a system providing help information in a DDHelp format also allows a user to receive help information in alternate formats, such as WinHelp format, etc. In this embodiment, a system using the DDHelp format provides a user with an option to get help information in an alternate format. The user can select this option by clicking or selecting a button provided with the help information displayed in DDHelp format. When a user selects such a button, the system searches various alternate formats available for providing help information. If an alternate format of providing help information is found, an alternate method of providing help information using such an alternate format is activated. Help information provided by such an alternate format may also include multimedia content, such as images, audio and video.",
        "Generally, computers using any of the Microsoft Windows\u00ae family of operating systems have an executable file named Winhelp.exe as a part of such an operating system. Winhelp.exe allows an application running on such a computer to display help information to a user in a WinHelp format. Software applications, such as AMS, use another file named DDHelp.exe to provide help information in a DD format. Enabling a software application using DDHelp.exe to provide help information to a user with Winhelp.exe thereby allows that application to provide help information to a user in more than one format. Moreover, allowing the WinHelp.exe to be executed from a template provided by the DDHelp.exe allows a user to easily access help information in more than one format from a single location.",
        "Referring now specifically to the accompanying drawings, FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example computer 100. As used herein, the term \u201ccomputer\u201d refers to any computer (e.g. portable computer, laptop computer, PDA, desktop computer, server, etc.) that employs any type of software to provide help information.

A block 124 of the help program 120 of FIG. 2 enables a user to initiate the help program 120 by clicking on a parameter within the device information template.",
        "A block 126 causes the help program 120 to determine if there is a WinHelp file available within the computer 100 for a device relating to the device information template presented by the block 122. If such a WinHelp file is available, a block 128 determines if the parameter selected by the user at the block 124 has a WinHelp topic defined within the computer 100. If no WinHelp topic is defined for such a parameter, a block 130, displays help information in a DDHelp format by presenting a DDHelp window. Typically, the help program 120 may use a DDHelp.exe file, which may be available on the computer 100, to display the help information in the DDHelp format. However, DDHelp is optional, i.e., various parameters, variables and methods within a DD may or may not have an associated DDHelp.",
        "After the block 120 displays the help information in DDHelp format, a block 132 waits for a further input from the user. If the user clicks a mouse or a key on a keyboard attached to the computer 100 to provide such an input, a block 136 closes the DDHelp window.",
        "If, at the block 128, the help program 120 determines that the parameter selected by the user at the block 124 has a WinHelp topic defined within the computer 100, a block 140 displays help information in a DDHelp format, where such help information includes a \u201cMore\u201d button. Subsequently, a block 142 waits for an input from the user. When a block 144 determines that the user has clicked on the appropriate mouse button or a key on the keyboard attached to the computer 100, a block 146 determines whether the user selected the \u201cMore\u201d button. If the block 146 determines that the user has selected the \u201cMore\u201d button, a block 148, displays a help information template in the WinHelp format. If not, the block 136 closes the DDHelp window.",

A user can invoke the DDHelp template 175 by clicking on a parameter within the device information template 170. In an alternate embodiment, a user can invoke the DDHelp template 175 by putting focus on a parameter within the device information template 170 and then pressing a help button and/or a function key on a keyboard. The DDHelp template 175 shows help information about a device or a device parameter. For example, the exemplary device information template 170 of FIG. 3 displays information about various parameters of a given device and the DDHelp template 175 provides help information about a device parameter pH slope. A user can click on other parameters listed in the device information template 170 to obtain help information about other parameters of a device. For example, if a user clicks on the \u201cpH LRV\u201d within the device information template 170, the DDHelp template 175 will give help information about the pH log reduction value of the device. While the information contained in the DDHelp template 175 may be obtained from the ROM 104, the RAM 106 or the storage device 112 of the computer 100, in an alternate format, such help information may be obtained from any other computer within a network of computers. Functioning of such a network of computers is further described with respect to FIGS. 6 to 8.",
