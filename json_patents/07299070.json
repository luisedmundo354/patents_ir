    "abstract": "A system and method for providing dynamic allocation of MIMO communication resources during a single communication. Various aspects of the present invention may comprise determining a first set of MIMO communication resources to utilize for communicating a first portion of a unit of information. The first set of MIMO communication resources may be allocated for communicating the first portion of the unit of information. A second set of MIMO communication resources may be determined to utilize for communicating a second portion of the unit of information, where the second set of MIMO communication resources is different from the first set of MIMO communication resources. The second set of MIMO communication resources may be allocated for communicating the second portion of the unit of information. The first and second portions of the unit of information may, for example, be communicated consecutively or concurrently.",
