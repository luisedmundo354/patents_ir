        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "This invention relates generally to semiconductor processing, and, more particularly, to detecting disturbances and determining disturbance types during semiconductor processing.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Statistical process control (SPC) is commonly used to monitor semiconductor processing tools based on measurements of parameters associated with features formed by the processing tools. For example, an etching process may be monitored by measuring depths of features formed on each semiconductor wafer in a lot of etched wafers. The parameters may be plotted on a statistical process control chart, e.g., as a function of processing lot or run. For example, the statistical process control chart may be formed by plotting the actual measured depths for features formed on a plurality of wafers. In some cases, operating recipes used for the processing tools may be modified during a processing run. The modifications may result in changes to the parameters of the features formed using the processes, such as a depth of an etched feature. Accordingly, a generalized statistical process control chart may plot values of the measured depths that are corrected for the expected changes in the parameters.",
        "Although a certain amount of random variation in the parameters is expected, deviations of one or more parameters from a target value may indicate undesirable and/or unexpected operation of the processing tool. Accordingly, the statistical process control chart (or the generalized statistical process control chart) may be examined for outlier points that deviate from a target value by an amount that is larger than expected for normal random variations of the associated parameter. For example, the statistical process control chart may be visually inspected by an engineer for outlier points. Alternatively, the statistical process control chart may be analyzed using statistical techniques. For example, an outlier point may be used as an indication that a disturbance has occurred in the processing. Accordingly, the outlier point may be used as a trigger for further analysis and determination of corresponding actions that may be used to address the issue.",
        "Conventional algorithms for analyzing the statistical process chart calculate a posteriori, i.e., after the fact, probability that the value of the outlier point indicates a step and/or impulse disturbance in the processing. However, the posteriori probability associated with the outlier point rarely, if ever, contains enough information to discriminate between a step disturbance and an impulse disturbance. Accordingly, conventional algorithms may select a second point associated with a feature formed after the feature associated with the outlier point and calculate a posteriori probability that the value of the second point indicates a step and/or impulse disturbance in the processing. If the posteriori probability associated with second point does not contain enough information to discriminate between a step disturbance and an impulse disturbance, another point may be selected and analyzed. This point-by-point process continues until the posteriori probability associated with one of the points increases above a predetermined threshold. In addition to the aforementioned requirement of an outlier detection algorithm (for example, a generalized SPC chart) to trigger the analysis, conventional algorithms for detecting step and/or impulse disturbances typically require a delay of 4 to 5 lots before the posteriori probability can discriminate between a step disturbance and an impulse disturbance.",
        "The amplitude of the deviation in the outlier point required to trigger conventional disturbance detection algorithms for analyzing the statistical process chart is typically large enough to trigger an alarm condition in the associated processing tool. Consequently, the conventional disturbance detection algorithm may miss some early warning signals until they become severe enough to trigger the SPC alarm. Accordingly, conventional disturbance detection algorithms may be inappropriate for closed-loop control of the processing tool because closed-loop control algorithms reduce variations in the measured parameters and thus the alarm condition will not be triggered in most cases.",
        "The present invention is directed to addressing the effects of one or more of the problems set forth above.",

The program storage medium may be magnetic (e.g., a floppy disk or a hard drive) or optical (e.g., a compact disk read only memory, or \u201cCD ROM\u201d), and may be read only or random access. Similarly, the transmission medium may be twisted wire pairs, coaxial cable, optical fiber, or some other suitable transmission medium known to the art.

        "FIG. 1 conceptually illustrates one exemplary embodiment of a system 100 for fabricating one or more wafers 105. Although a single wafer 105 is shown in FIG. 1, persons of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the wafer 105 may be representative of a single wafer 105, a plurality of wafers 105, a wafer lot, and/or a plurality of wafer lots. Furthermore, the wafer 105 may be substantially unprocessed or may have been previously processed. In the illustrated embodiment, the wafer 105 may be provided to a processing tool 110. Exemplary processing tools include, but are not limited to, deposition tools, lithography tools, etching tools, ion implantation tools, and polishing tools. The processing tool 110 may be a standalone tool configured to perform a single processing task, such as deposition, lithography, etching, plant implantation, or polishing, or it may be an integrated tool that is configured to perform multiple processing tasks. For example, the processing tool 110 may include a plurality of chambers for performing a plurality of processing tasks.",
        "The illustrated embodiment of the system 100 also includes a measurement tool 115. Exemplary measurement tools 115 include, but are not limited to, metrology tools (such as scatterometers and ellipsometers) and wafer electrical test tools. The measurement tool 115 may be a standalone tool or an integrated tool. Moreover, in some embodiments, the measurement tool 115 may be integrated with the processing tool 110. The wafer 105 may be provided to the measurement tool 115 before, during, and/or after processing by the processing tool 110. The measurement tool 115 may measure one or more parameters associated with processing of the wafer 105 by the processing tool 110, as well as any other processing that may have been performed on the wafer 105. For example, the measurement tool 115 may include a metrology tool for measuring physical parameters of features formed on the wafer 105, such as layer thicknesses, profiles and/or critical dimensions of features formed on the wafer 105, depths of vias and/or trenches formed on the wafer 105, and the like. For another example, the measurement tool 115 may include a wafer electrical test tool for measuring electrical parameters of features formed on the wafer, such as voltages, currents, and the like.",
        "A disturbance analysis unit 120 is communicatively coupled to the measurement tool 115. The disturbance analysis unit 120 may access values of one or more of the parameters associated with the wafer 105 and use these values to detect a disturbance in the processing performed by the processing tool 110, as well as any other processing performed on the wafer 105. In one embodiment, the disturbance may be detected by assuming that a disturbance occurs at every run, and then the disturbance analysis unit 120 confirms or rejects the hypothesis based on an analysis of a posteriori probability sequence. When the hypothesis is confirmed, i.e., a disturbance has occurred, the disturbance analysis unit 120 determines the type of the disturbance by matching the pattern of the posterior probability to the pattern of the posteriori probability corresponding to a type of disturbance, such as a step disturbance, an impulse disturbance, and the like, as will be discussed in detail below. Persons of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the disturbance analysis unit 120 may be implemented in hardware, software, or any combination thereof.",
        "In one embodiment, the disturbance analysis unit 120 is also communicatively coupled to a process control and fault detection/classification (FDC) system 125. The disturbance analysis unit 120 may therefore provide information to the process control and fault detection/classification system 125 based upon the analysis of the parameter values, the probabilities, and/or the pattern of probabilities discussed above. The disturbance analysis unit 120 may provide disturbance information that may be used by the process control and fault detection/classification system 125 to modify an operating recipe used by the processing tool 110. Alternatively, the disturbance analysis unit 120 may feed-forward information that may be used by other processing tools (not shown). For example, the information may be used in step tracking, impulse rejection, or other operations.",
        "FIG. 2A shows a first exemplary embodiment of a time series process chart 200. In the illustrated embodiment, values 201 (only one labeled in FIG. 2A) of a parameter associated with a plurality of wafer lots are plotted as a function of lot number. As discussed above, the parameters may be physical parameters or electrical parameters associated with the wafer lots. However, persons of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the parameter is not limited to individual parameters that may be measured. In alternative embodiments, composite and/or derived parameters may be formed based upon one or more of the measured parameters or combinations of the measured parameters. The lot number is plotted along horizontal axis 205 and increases to the right. The value of the parameter is plotted along vertical axis 210 and increases upward. Units of the axes 205, 210 are arbitrary.",
        "Line 215 indicates a target value for the parameters 201. The first four parameter values 201 (moving left to right) are approximately randomly distributed around the target value 215. However, later parameter values 201 are approximately randomly distributed around a target value 220 that differs from the target value 215 by an amount indicated by arrow 225. This type of disturbance in the parameter values 201 is commonly referred to as a \u201cstep disturbance.\u201d Although the disturbance 225 is positive in the illustrated embodiment, the present invention is not limited to increases in the target values 215, 220. In alternative embodiments, the disturbance 225 may be positive or negative. Furthermore, the target values 215, 220 may not be constant. For example, the target values 215, 220 may vary as a function of lot number if a time series of composite and/or derived parameters are plotted.",
        "In the illustrated embodiment, the parameter values 201 are grouped into a pre-disturbance group 227 and a post-disturbance group 228. The pre-disturbance group 227 includes parameter values 201 for lot numbers processed prior to the disturbance 225 and the post-disturbance group 228 includes parameter values 201 for lot numbers processed substantially during or after the disturbance indicated by the arrow 225. For example, a fault may occur in a processing tool while processing wafers in one of the lots, in which case this lot number and subsequent lot numbers may be included in the post-disturbance group 228.",
        "FIG. 2B conceptually illustrates a first exemplary embodiment of a plot 230 of a plurality of probabilities 235 (only one labeled in FIG. 2B). In the illustrated embodiment, the probabilities 235 represent a probability that a corresponding parameter value 201 indicates that a step disturbance has occurred. Although posteriori probabilities may be used, persons of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the probabilities 235 are not limited to posteriori probabilities indicative of a step disturbance. In alternative embodiments, the probabilities 235 may represent probabilities associated with other types of disturbances. The lot number is plotted along horizontal axis 240 and increases to the right. The value of the posteriori probability 235 is plotted along vertical axis 245 and increases upward.",
        "The probabilities 235 associated with parameter values 201 for lot numbers in the pre-disturbance group 227 are prior probabilities, each of which represents the probability that a step disturbance occurred based on information associated with the parameter values 201 in the pre-disturbance group 227. In this illustrative example, the prior probability is approximately equal to 0.5, indicating that without any further information, there are roughly equal probabilities that a step disturbance did or did not occur to the current parameter value 201. The probability 235 associated with parameter values 201 in the post-disturbance group 228 are posteriori probabilities, which are calculated by incorporating the parameter values 201 in post-disturbance group 228. In this illustrative example, the posteriori probability increases with increasing lot number until the posteriori probability rises to approximately 1.0, indicating a very strong probability that a step disturbance did occur.",
        "FIG. 3A shows a second exemplary embodiment of a time series process chart 300. In the illustrated embodiment, values 301 (only one labeled in FIG. 3A) of a parameter associated with a plurality of wafer lots are plotted as a function of lot number. As discussed above, the parameters may be physical parameters, electrical parameters, parameters formed based upon the measured parameters or combinations of the measured parameters, and the like. The lot number is plotted along horizontal axis 305 and increases to the right. The value of the parameter is plotted along vertical axis 310 and increases upward. Units of the axes 305, 310 are arbitrary.",

However, the fifth parameter value 301 deviates from the target value 315 by an amount indicated by the arrow 325. Subsequent parameter values 301 again appear to be approximately randomly distributed around the target value 315. This type of disturbance in the parameter values 301 is commonly referred to as an \u201cimpulse disturbance.\u201d Although the impulse disturbance 325 is positive in the illustrated embodiment, the present invention is not limited to positive impulse disturbances 325. In alternative embodiments, the impulse disturbances 325 may be positive or negative. Furthermore, the target value 315 may not be constant. For example, the target value 315 may vary as a function of lot number if the time series process chart 300 is a generalized time series process chart.",
        "In the illustrated embodiment, the parameter values 301 are grouped into a pre-disturbance group 327 and a post-disturbance group 328.

In the illustrated embodiment, the probabilities 335 represent a probability that a corresponding parameter value 301 indicates that a step disturbance has occurred. However, persons of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the probabilities 335 are not limited to probabilities indicative of a step disturbance.

The posteriori probability 335 associated with parameter values 301 in the post-disturbance group 328 increases with increasing lot number for the first post-disturbance parameter value 301, but then the posteriori probability drops to approximately 0.0, indicating a very strong probability that an impulse disturbance occurred.",
        "FIG. 4 conceptually illustrates first and second exemplary embodiments of patterns 400, 405 of probabilities 410(1-3), 415(1-3). In the illustrated embodiment, each of the probabilities 410(1-3), 415(1-3) represents a posteriori probability that a step disturbance has occurred, as discussed above. The patterns 400, 405 may be formed using probabilities 410(1-3), 415(1-3) associated with parameter values selected from a post-disturbance window, such as the post-disturbance windows 228, 328, shown in FIGS. 2B and 3B. The lot number is plotted along horizontal axis 420 and increases to the right. The value of the posteriori probability is plotted along vertical axis 425 and increases upward.",
        "The first exemplary embodiment of the pattern 400 shows three probabilities 410(1-3) that generally increase with increasing run (or lot) number. The pattern 400 may be indicative of a step disturbance, as may be seen by comparing the pattern 400 to the probability plot 230 shown in FIG. 2B. Accordingly, the pattern 400 may be used to determine that a step disturbance has occurred. In one embodiment, a disturbance may be detected by determining that the probability 410(1) exceeds a threshold 430, e.g., the probability 410(1) may be used as a trigger for a statistical analysis of the probabilities 410(1-3). The disturbance may then be identified as a step disturbance by comparing the pattern 400 to a target pattern and/or threshold. In one embodiment, the probabilities 410(1-3) are compared to the threshold 430 and the disturbance is identified as a step disturbance if all of the probabilities 410(1-3) exceed the threshold value 430. Alternatively, the probabilities 410(1-3) may be compared to a target pattern 435. For example, the disturbance may be identified as a step disturbance if the probabilities 410(1-3) are equal to or exceed the corresponding values of the target pattern 435. Persons of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the statistical analysis described above is intended to be illustrative and not to limit the present invention. In alternative embodiments, other techniques for analyzing the pattern 400 to determine a type of the disturbance may be used.",
        "The second exemplary embodiment of the pattern 405 shows three probabilities 415(1-3) that generally decrease with increasing run number. The pattern 405 may be indicative of an impulse disturbance, as may be seen by comparing the pattern 405 to the probability plot 330 shown in FIG. 3B. Accordingly, the pattern 405 may be used to determine that an impulse disturbance has occurred. In one embodiment, a disturbance may be detected by determining that the probability 415(1) exceeds a threshold 440, e.g., the probability 415(1) may be used as a trigger for a statistical analysis of the probabilities 415(1-3). The disturbance may be identified as an impulse disturbance by comparing the pattern 405 to a target pattern and/or threshold. In one embodiment, the probabilities 415(1-3) are compared to the threshold 440 and the disturbance is identified as an impulse disturbance if the probability 415(1) exceeds the threshold value 440, but the probabilities 415(2-3) fall below the threshold value 440. Alternatively, the probabilities 415(1-3) may be compared to a target pattern 445. For example, the disturbance may be identified as an impulse disturbance if the probability 415(1) exceeds the threshold value 440, but the probabilities 415(2-3) fall below the values of the target pattern 445. Persons of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the statistical analysis described above is intended to be illustrative and not to limit the present invention. In alternative embodiments, other techniques for analyzing the pattern 405 to determine a type of the disturbance may be used.",
        "FIG. 5 conceptually illustrates one exemplary embodiment of a method 500 for detecting and classifying a disturbance. In the illustrated embodiment, a plurality of probabilities associated with a corresponding plurality of wafer processing parameters is determined (at 505). For example, the probabilities may be indicative of a step disturbance, as discussed above. If none of the probabilities indicates that a disturbance has occurred, then no disturbance analysis is triggered (at 510) and data associated with the wafer processing parameters may be provided to, and processed by, an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) filter. If at least one of the probabilities indicates that a disturbance has occurred, this probability may be used to trigger (at 510) an analysis of the posteriori probabilities.",
        "The type of the disturbance may be determined (at 520) based on a pattern formed with the plurality of probabilities. The pattern may then be compared to a threshold and/or a target pattern, as discussed in detail above. If the pattern is determined (at 520) to be indicative of a step disturbance, then a step tracking algorithm may be invoked (at 525). Step tracking algorithms are known to persons of ordinary skill in the art and so will not be discussed further herein. If the pattern is determined (at 520) to be indicative of an impulse disturbance, then an impulse rejection algorithm may be invoked (at 530). Impulse rejection algorithms are known to persons of ordinary skill in the art and so will not be discussed further herein.",
        "The method 500 may have a number of advantages over conventional practice. For example, the method 500 does not require an SPC chart to detect the onset of the disturbance. Thus, the method 500 may be implemented in processes that are not equipped with the SPC charts. Moreover, the amplitude of deviations in outlier points required to trigger an analysis such as may be implemented in the method 500 may be much smaller that the deviation that could trigger an alarm condition in a processing tool. Accordingly, the method 500 may be suitable for implementation in closed-loop control algorithms and variations in the measured parameters may be reduced to values substantially smaller than the deviations in the measured parameters that would trigger an alarm condition.",
        "FIG. 6 shows a third exemplary embodiment of a time series process chart 600. A lot number is plotted along horizontal axis 605 and increases to the right. The value of a parameter associated with processing of wafers in each lot is plotted along vertical axis 610 and increases upward. Units of the parameter and the vertical axis 610 are arbitrary. In the illustrated embodiment, a step onset (indicated by a square) or an impulse onset (indicated by a triangle) is detected and classified after only 2-3 lots once a disturbance has occurred. For example, the delay in detecting the step onset may be approximately equal to the number of lots in a post-disturbance window. Conventional techniques for analyzing the time series process chart 600 typically require at least four to five lots to determine whether the disturbance is a step disturbance or not once SPC chart detects the disturbance.",
        "FIG. 7 conceptually illustrates a time series process chart 700 and a plurality of pre-disturbance windows 705(1-4) and post-disturbance windows 710(1-4). In the illustrated embodiment, values 701 (only one indicated in FIG. 7) of a parameter associated with a plurality of wafer lots are plotted as a function of lot number. As discussed above, the parameters may be physical parameters, electrical parameters, parameters formed based upon the measured parameters or combinations of the measured parameters, and the like. The lot number is plotted along horizontal axis 715 and increases to the right. The value of the parameter is plotted along vertical axis 720 and increases upward. Units of the axes 715, 720 are arbitrary.",
        "The post-disturbance windows 710(1-4) may have different lengths so that they encompass parameter values associated with different ranges of lot number. Persons of ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that the particular ranges of lot numbers associated with the post-disturbance windows 710(1-4) are intended to be illustrative and not to limit the present invention. Furthermore, persons of ordinary skill in the art should also appreciate that the pre-disturbance windows 705(1-4) may also have variable lengths.",
        "The patterns formed using the probabilities associated with parameter values (or lot numbers) in the different post-disturbance windows 710(1-4) may be used to detect and classify different types of disturbances. For example, probabilities associated with parameter values in the post-disturbance window 710(1), which includes two lot numbers, may be used to detect impulse disturbances. For another example, probabilities associated with parameter values in the post-disturbance window 710(2), which includes three lot numbers, may be used to detect step disturbances that last for approximately two lots. For yet another example, probabilities associated with parameter values in the post-disturbance window 710(3), which includes four lot numbers, may be used to detect step disturbances that last for approximately three lots, such as the step disturbance shown in the time series process chart 700. For yet another example, probabilities associated with parameter values in the post-disturbance window 710(4), which includes five lot numbers, may be used to detect step disturbances that last for approximately four lots.",
        "FIG. 8 shows a fourth exemplary embodiment of a time series process chart 800. A lot number is plotted along horizontal axis 805 and increases to the right. The value of a parameter associated with processing of wafers in each lot is plotted along vertical axis 810 and increases upward. Units of the parameter and the vertical axis 810 are arbitrary. In the illustrated embodiment, a disturbance onset is detected with at most 2 runs delay, and the type of disturbance is classified without delay (i.e., only one inherent delay). For example, the onset of a step disturbance (indicated by a square) is detected 2 runs later after the disturbance occurs and the onset of an impulse disturbance (indicated by a triangle) is detected 1 run after the disturbance occurs. For another example, an impulse disturbance would be classified one run after the disturbance occurs and a short step with duration 2 would be classified once the short-step finished, i.e., 3 runs after the disturbance occurs.",
