        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a length-adjusting device for a head strap. More particularly, the present invention relates to a length-adjusting device for a head strap of a pair of swimming/diving goggles.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "A pair of typical swimming/diving goggles includes a buckle mounted to each side of a body of the pair of swimming/diving goggles or to a head strap at a location behind the head of the wearer to allow adjustment of the length of the head strap. FIG. 9 illustrates a pair of swimming/diving goggles using a conventional buckle 1\u2032 to adjust the length of a head strap 3\u2032. The rigid buckle 1\u2032 includes a connecting portion 11\u2032 on an end thereof for connecting with the body 2\u2032 of the pair of swimming/diving goggles. A tying portion 12\u2032 is provided on the other end of the buckle 1\u2032 and includes two posts 121\u2032 and 122\u2032. The head strap 3\u2032 is wound around the posts 121\u2032 and 122\u2032 for fixing the length of the head strap 3\u2032. Adjustment of the length of the head strap 3\u2032 is not easy, as the user has to loosen the head strap 3\u2032 from the posts 121\u2032 and 122\u2032. Further, the buckle 1\u2032 is separate from the body 2\u2032 and thus could not provide an integral appearance. Further, the connecting portion 11\u2032 is liable to disengage from the body 2\u2032 when subjected to external impact. Further, the rigid buckle 1\u2032 is in tight contact with a side of the user's head and thus causes discomfort. FIG. 10 illustrates a buckle for a pair of swimming/diving goggles disclosed in Applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 6,691,378. The buckle comprises a body 4\u2032 having a pressing portion 41\u2032, a clamping portion 42\u2032, and a connecting portion 43\u2032 connecting the pressing portion 41\u2032 with the clamping portion 42\u2032.",
        "The pressing portion 41\u2032 includes a post 411\u2032 and a release section 412\u2032 on an end thereof. An end of the clamping portion 42\u2032 includes a clamping hole 421\u2032 through which a head strap 5\u2032 extends. A retaining edge 422\u2032 is formed on a top edge of each lateral wall delimiting the clamping hole 421\u2032 for retaining the head strap 5\u2032.",
        "In assembly, the connecting portion 43\u2032 is wound around a body 6\u2032 of the pair of swimming/diving goggles, with the pressing portion 41\u2032 pressing against an outer side of the body 6\u2032. An end of the head strap 5\u2032 is extended through the clamping hole 421\u2032 and wound around the post 411\u2032 and then extended out of the body 6\u2032 via the clamping hole 421\u2032. The distal end of the head strap 5\u2032 can be pulled until the required tightness and length of the head strap 5\u2032 are obtained, as shown in FIG. 11.",
        "Referring to FIG. 12, when loosening the head strap 5\u2032, the pressing portion 41\u2032 is moved until the post 411\u2032 is disengaged from the retaining edge 422\u2032. An inner portion 52\u2032 of the head strap 5\u2032 can be moved to loosen the head strap 5\u2032.",
        "Although the buckle of FIGS. 10-12 allows easy adjustment and provides stable clamping, the buckle body 4\u2032 is separate from the body 6\u2032 of the pair of swimming/diving goggles and thus could not provide an integral appearance. Further, the inner side of the clamping portion 42\u2032 of the buckle body 4\u2032 is in tight contact with a side of the user's head and thus causes discomfort.",
        "FIGS. 13-15 illustrate a pair of swimming/diving goggles disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,446,272. The pair of dimming/diving goggles comprises a pair of lens parts 71\u2032, a pair of lens frames 72\u2032, two separate buckle assemblies, and an elastic strap 75\u2032. Each buckle assembly includes a buckle body 73\u2032 having a strap-supporting portion 731\u2032 around which the strap 75\u2032 is wrapped, and a slider 74\u2032 which is slidable between a first position (see FIG. 14) and a second position (see FIG. 15) with respect to the strap-supporting portion 731\u2032. When the slider 74\u2032 is moved toward the buckle body 73\u2032, a strap-pressing piece 741\u2032 of the slider 74\u2032 presses against the strap 75\u2032, and an end 742\u2032 of the strap-pressing piece 741\u2032 is engaged with a transverse ridge 751\u2032 on the strap 75\u2032, as shown in FIG. 14. On the other hand, when the slider 74\u2032 is moved away from the buckle body 73\u2032, the strap-pressing piece 741\u2032 no longer presses the strap 75\u2032 and thus allows adjustment to the length of the strap 75\u2032, as shown in FIG. 15.",
        "The strap 75\u2032 is fixed by moving the slider 74\u2032 inward. However, when an excessive pulling force is applied to the strap 75\u2032, the slider 74\u2032 slides and thus could not provide a reliable pressing/positioning effect to the strap 75\u2032. Further, the buckle body 73\u2032 and the slider 74\u2032 are separate from each other and have to be coupled with the lens parts 71\u2032 and lens frames 72\u2032, resulting in troublesome assembly. Further, the assembled buckle body 73\u2032 and slider 74\u2032 may be disengaged from the lens parts 71\u2032 and lens frames 72\u2032 when subjected to impact.",
        "FIG. 16 illustrates a pair of swimming/diving goggles disclosed in Taiwan Utility Model Publication No. M263132. The pair of swimming/diving goggles includes two separate buckle members 81\u2032 and 82\u2032 for coupling with a body 83\u2032 of the pair of swimming/diving goggles. The buckle member 82\u2032 includes a transverse rod 821\u2032 around which a head strap 84\u2032 is wound. The buckle member 81\u2032 includes a resilient piece 811\u2032 and a positioning block 812\u2032 that can be biased by the resilient piece 811\u2032 to press against the head strap 84\u2032 at an end. The positioning block 812\u2032 can be pressed to disengage from the head strap 84\u2032 for adjusting the length of the head strap 84\u2032.",
        "However, the head strap 84\u2032 could not be reliably positioned when the resilient piece 81\u2033 fatigues. Further, troublesome assembling is required, as there are many elements involved. Further, the buckle members 81\u2032 and 82\u2032 are separate from the body 83\u2032 of the pair of swimming/diving goggles and thus could be disengaged from the body 83\u2032 when subjected to impact.",
        "A pair of swimming/diving goggles in accordance with the present invention comprises a goggle body, a buckle, and a head strap. The goggle body comprises an end including a coupling section that has a through-hole. A wall delimiting the through-hole includes a pressing face. The buckle comprises a buckle body including two lateral sides and an inner face. Two lugs respectively extend from the lateral sides of the buckle body. A pin extends between the lugs. A first gap is defined between the pin and an inner face of the buckle body. A second gap is defined between the pin and the pressing face of the goggle body when the buckle is mounted to the goggle body.",
        "The head strap is made of soft material and comprises an end extending from an inner side of the goggle body through the through-hole of the goggle body, the first gap, and then extending back to the inner side of the goggle body via the through-hole, with the head strap including an outer portion and an inner portion after assembly.",
        "When the outer portion of the head strap is pulled by a wearer, the head strap is tightened to a head of the wearer, and when the outer portion of the head strap is released, a clamping force provided by the inner portion of the head strap moves the pin to a position in which the head strap is tightly clamped between the pin and the pressing face.",
        "When the buckle is moved toward an inner end of the through-hole, the second gap between the pin and the pressing face becomes larger to allow loosening of the head strap. Preferably, the buckle body covers the through-hole.",
        "Preferably, another wall delimiting the through-hole of the goggle body comprises an abutting face. Each of the lugs comprises an abutting face. A space is defined between the abutting faces of the lugs and the abutting face of the goggle body and allows movement of the buckle body.",
        "Preferably, the end of the head strap comprises a first, outer protrusion and a second, inner protrusion spaced from the first, outer protrusion. The second, inner protrusion has a height greater than that of the first, outer protrusion. The first, outer protrusion and the second, inner protrusion flex and pass through the first gap between the pin and the inner face of the buckle body when the end of the head strap is passed through the first gap. The first, outer protrusion only allows slight flexure of the second, inner protrusion and thus prevents the head strap to move in a reverse direction after the second, inner protrusion has passed through the first gap.",
        "Preferably, the head strap further comprises a plurality of teeth.",
        "Other objectives, advantages, and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",

        "FIG. 16 is a partial top view, partly sectioned, of a pair of swimming/diving goggles disclosed in Taiwan Utility Model Publication No. M263132.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1, a pair of swimming/diving goggles in accordance with the present invention comprises a goggle body 1, two buckles 2 (only one is shown in the drawings), and a head strap 3. The goggle body 1 comprises a coupling section 11 on each of two sides thereof for coupling with an associated one of the buckles 2. Each coupling section 11 comprises a through-hole 12 through which an end of the head strap 3 is extends and folded in two. Two opposite walls delimiting the through-hole 12 respectively include a pressing face 13 and an inclined abutting face 14.",
        "Each buckle 2 is made of rigid material and comprises a buckle body 21 that covers an associated one of the through-holes 12 of the goggle body 1. The buckle body 21 comprises an anti-slide outer face 22. The buckle body 21 further comprises two lugs 23 respectively extending from two lateral sides thereof. The lugs 23 include aligned holes 25 through which a pin 26 extends. Each lug 23 includes an abutting face 24 facing the abutting face 14 of an associated side of the goggle 1. A gap 28 (FIG. 5) exists between the pin 26 and an inner face of the buckle body 21 to allow passage of the head strap 3.",
        "Referring to FIG. 5, when the buckle 2 is mounted to an associated side of the goggle body 1, a gap 27 (FIG. 5) is extended between the pin 26 and the associated pressing face 13 of the goggle body 1 to allow passage of the head strap 3, and a space 29 (FIG. 5) is defined between the abutting faces 24 of the lugs 23 of the buckle 2 and the associated abutting face 14 of the goggles 1, allowing movement of the buckle 2 in the space 29.",
        "The head strap 3 is made of soft material and includes a first, outer protrusion 31 and a second, inner protrusion 32 on each of two ends thereof. The second inner protrusion 32 is spaced from the first, outer protrusion 31 and has a height greater than that of first, outer protrusion 31. The head strap 3 further includes a plurality of ridges 33 on an outer face thereof.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 2 through 4, in assembly, an end of the head strap 3 is extended from an inner side of the goggle body 1 through an associated through-hole 12, the gap 28 between the pin 26 of the associated buckle 2 and the inner face of the associated buckle 2 and then extended back to the inner side of the goggle body 1 via the associated through-hole 12. When extending the end of the head strap 3 through the gap 28 between the pin 26 of the associated buckle 2 and the inner face of the associated buckle 2, the protrusions 31 and 32 of the head strap 3 flex and thus pass through the gap 28, as shown in FIG. 3. After the protrusions 31 and 32 have passed through the gap 28, movement of the head strap 3 in the reverse direction is not allowed. This is because the first, outer protrusion 31 only allows slight flexure of the second, inner protrusion 32. Hence, as illustrated in FIG. 4, the second, inner protrusion 32 is stopped by the end face of the buckle body 21 and thus prevents reverse movement of the head strap 3. Improved assembling stability is thus provided.",
        "Referring to FIG. 5, when wearing the pair of swimming/diving goggles in accordance with the present invention, the buckle 2 is moved by the pulling force applied to the head strap 3 to a position covering the through-hole 12 of the goggle body 1. The buckle 2 is not in contact with the head of the wearer, thereby providing wearing comfort. Further, adjustment of the length of the head strap 3 is achieved while pulling an outer portion 34 (FIG. 5) of the head strap 3. The pin 26 may pivot during pulling of the head strap 3 to allow smooth pulling operation.",
        "Referring to FIG. 6, when the outer portion 34 of the head strap 3 is released, a clamping force provided by the inner portion 35 of the head strap 3 moves the pin 26 (and the buckle 2) to move toward an outer end of the through-hole 12 along a direction indicated by the arrow. The head strap 3 is thus tightly clamped between the pin 26 and the pressing sidewall 13 of the goggle body 1 to thereby fix the length of the head strap 3. The teeth 33 of the head strap 3 enhance the clamping effect. The greater the clamping force is, the greater travel of the pin 26 and the buckle 2 has, and the tighter the head strap 3 is clamped. The clamping reliability is thus improved.",
        "In brief, the head strap 3 is tightened to a head of a wearer when the outer portion 34 of the head strap 3 is pulled.",
        "Referring to FIG. 7, when releasing the head strap 3 is required, the wear moves the buckle 2 toward an inner end of the associated through-hole 12 by the anti-slide outer face 22 of the buckle body 21. Displacement of the buckle 2 is limited by the abutting faces 24 of the buckle 2 and the abutting face 14 of the goggle body 1. The gap 27 between the pin 26 and the pressing face 13 becomes larger and thus allows adjustment of the length (loosening) of the head strap 3 by pulling the inner portion 35 of the head strap 3.",
        "Referring to FIG. 8, after assembly, the buckle 2 is mounted in the coupling section 11 of the goggle body 1, with the lugs 23 located in the through-hole 12, providing an integral design while preventing the buckle 2 from abutting against the wearer's head. The wearing comfort is improved. Further, the cost of the pair of swimming/diving goggles is cut, as fewer elements are used. Further, disengagement of the head strap 3 and the buckle 2 is difficult after assembly. Namely, the buckle 2 can be reliably mounted to the goggle body 1 while allowing easy adjustment of the length of the head strap 3.",
        "The pin 26 can be fixed between the lugs 23 of the buckle 1 without pivotal movement. Further, the teeth 33 of the head strap 3 can be omitted. Further, the pair of swimming/diving goggle may include only one buckle mounted to only one side of the goggle body 1.",
        "Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described, numerous modifications and variations are still possible without departing from the essence of the invention. The scope of the invention is limited by the accompanying claims."
