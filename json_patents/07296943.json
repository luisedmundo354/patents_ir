Front surfaces 30, 32 may each contact an adjoining section of baseboard 36. Lever 64 may be depressed to operate pump 60 for liquid dispenser 56, in turn causing the sponge to be wetted. Water in the sponge may contact front face 34 of baseboard 36. The user may grasp grip end portion 46 of handle 28 and push apparatus 10 forward in the direction of arrow F of FIG. 1. Rollers 48 may help a user to maintain pads 20, 22 in contact with front face 34 of baseboard 36. Thus, for example, the sponge (pad 20) may wet and clean a portion of baseboard 36. Thereafter, as the user continues to move the apparatus forward, dry cloth (pad 22) may further clean and dry the portion of baseboard 36. Drying of baseboard 36 immediately after wet washing may inhibit streaking of baseboard 36. Simultaneously, pads 80, 82 may clean top face 78 of baseboard 36. Thus, apparatus 10 may remove dust, stains, and other materials from front face 34 and top face 78 of baseboard 36.",
        "In some embodiments, a forward pad that includes a leading portion may be used to clean an interior corner of a room where two baseboards meet. Referring again to FIG. 5, a user may operate the apparatus along a first baseboard 102. When the apparatus reaches corner 104, the leading portion 20\u2032 may abut second baseboard 106. A user may move the apparatus so that leading portion 20\u2032 cleans second baseboard 106 near corner 104. The remainder of pad 20 may clean first baseboard 102 near corner 104.",
        "In another embodiment, a pair of pad holders may be coupled by an interconnecting member to a handle at a location between the two pad holders. FIG. 6 depicts apparatus 10\u2032 including pad holders 24, 26, each coupled to one end of interconnecting member 108. Handle 28 may be coupled to interconnecting member 108 at pivot joint 110. In an embodiment, pivot joint 110 may allow rotation of handle 28 about an axis perpendicular to face 112 of interconnecting member 108. An angle between handle 28 and a plane of a wall may remain substantially constant as the handle pivots about the axis. In another embodiment, pivoting joint 110 may include a ball joint that allows rotation about an unlimited number of axes. Apparatus 10\u2032 may be operated along a baseboard to clean the baseboard. Reaction forces of the baseboard against pad holders 24, 26 may completely or partially balance each other during use to inhibit rotation of pads away from the baseboard.",
        "In an embodiment, pump 6O may be activated by trigger 114. Operation of trigger 114 may pump a fluid from liquid dispenser 56 through tube 58A, pump 60, and tube 58B to port 57. Port 57 may be located at the top of holder 24. Distribution of the fluid in pad 20 from port 57 may be promoted by gravity.",
        "In an embodiment, pads for cleaning a top face of a baseboard may be adjustable to facilitate cleaning of baseboards of various heights. FIGS. 7A and 7B depict pad holder 24\u2032 coupled to pads 20, 22. FIG. 7C depicts a cross-sectional view of pad holder 24\u2032 taken substantially along 7C-7C of FIG. 7A. Pad holder 24\u2032 may be coupled to pivoting joint 110 by threading nut 118 onto threaded post 120. Wheels 48 may be coupled to pad holder 24\u2032 at axles 52. Top pad holder 116 may be coupled to pad holder 24\u2032 using fastener 122. Top pad holder 116 may run along guides 124 of pad holder 24\u2032. In an embodiment, fastener 122 may include a thumbscrew. A user may loosen fastener 122 so that the user may slide fastener 122 up or down slot 126 (as indicated by arrows V) until top pads 125, 127 are at a desired height relative to the bottom of pad holder 24\u2032. The desired height may be approximately equal to a height of a baseboard to be cleaned. A user may tighten fastener 122 to lock top pad holder 116 at the desired height. Fluid may be introduced into pad 20 through fluid port 57.",
        "Top pad holders 116 may be removed and replaced. In an embodiment, a user may be provided with a set of top pad holders 116 of various widths W. Top pads 125, 127 may be preinstalled on each top pad holder. A user may select a top pad holder that is a suitable width for a baseboard to be cleaned.",
        "In some embodiments, guards may be provided to protect surfaces of baseboards, walls, or floors from mechanical damage (e.g., scratching, marring, or puncturing) or exposure to fluids by a cleaning apparatus. FIGS. 7B and 7C depict guard 128 on the side of top pad holder 116. FIGS. 7A and 7C depict guards 129 at the bottom of pads 20, 22. Guards 128 and 129 may be formed of a soft material including, but not limited to, plastic and/or rubber. Guard 128 may inhibit scratching of a wall during use of the apparatus. Guard 129 may inhibit fluids from seeping onto a carpet or other floor covering during use of the apparatus.",
        "In an embodiment, top pads may be adjustable in both vertical and horizontal directions. FIGS. 8A and 8B depict pad holder 24\u2032 coupled to adjustable top pad holder 116. FIG. 8C depicts a cross-sectional view taken substantially along 8C-8C of FIG. 8A. Top pad holder 116 may be coupled to holder 24\u2032 using captive fastener 130.
