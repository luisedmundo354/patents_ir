        "Before drying the crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate, it is preferable to pulverize the crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate in order to efficiently dry the crystals. This pulverization is carried out after filtering the resulting crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate. It is preferable to predry the crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate in order to efficiently pulverize the crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate.

        "The drying time can be furthermore shortened if the drying is carried out under reduced pressure. It is desired that the reduced pressure is 1.33 to 13300 Pa, preferably 10 to 6650 Pa, more preferably 100 to 1995 Pa, from the viewpoint of drying in a short period of time without using a powerful vacuum pump.",
        "It is desired that the drying of the crystals of a mirtazapine hydrate is carried out until the water content of the resulting anhydrous mirtazapine crystals becomes not more than 0.5% by weight, preferably not more than 0.3% by weight, from the viewpoint of imparting excellent low hygroscopic properties to the resulting anhydrous mirtazapine crystals.",
        "The mirtazapine crystals thus obtained exhibit remarkably excellent properties such that the hygroscopic degree is not more than 0.6% by weight even though the mirtazapine crystals are stored in the air having a relative humidity of 75% at 25\u00b0 C. under atmospheric pressure for 500 hours.",

The mixture was filtered, and the decolorizing carbon was then washed with 12 mL of methanol. Thereafter, 1116 mL of ion-exchanged water was added in a thin stream at 20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 C. with stirring, and the mixture was aged for one hour.",
        "Next, the solution was cooled to 0\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 C. for one hour, and the solution was filtered. Crystals were washed with liquid prepared by mixing 43.2 mL of methanol with 129.6 mL of ion-exchanged water of which liquid temperature was 0\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 C.

The water content of the resulting anhydrous mirtazapine crystals was determined by Karl-Fischer method. As a result, the water content was 0.1% by weight. In addition, its melting point was 114\u00b0 to 116\u00b0 C.",
        "The crude mirtazapine obtained in Production Example 1 was recrystallized in accordance with a process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,062,848. Specifically, 20 g of the crude mirtazapine obtained in Production Example 1 was dissolved in 140 mL of tert-butyl methyl ether with heating, and 0.2 g of decolorizing carbon and 0.2 g of celite were added to the resulting solution to allow decoloration, and the mixture was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated until the amount of the solution attained to 41.2 g, and 5.4 g of tert-butyl methyl ether was added to the concentrate.

        "As is clear from the results shown in FIG. 2, it can be seen that the anhydrous mirtazapine crystals obtained in Example 7 have a very low hygroscopic degree after 500 hours passed, so that they are remarkably excellent in low hygroscopic properties, as compared with that of the mirtazapine crystals obtained in Comparative Example 3.",
        "In 4728 g of methanol was dissolved 1195.46 g of a crude mirtazapine (HPLC purity: 99.0%) at 0\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 C., and 12 g of decolorizing carbon was added thereto, and the mixture was stirred at 5\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes. This solution was filtered at 0\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 C. Thereafter, 4065 g of ion-exchanged water was introduced into the filtrate, and 100 mg of seed crystals were added thereto. Thereto was added in a thin stream 9707 g of ion-exchanged water at 0\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 C. to allow crystallization. The mixture was stirred at 0\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 C. for 1 hour, and crystals were filtered. The crystals were washed with a mixed solution (liquid temperature: 0\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 C.) of 340 g of methanol and 1291 g of ion-exchanged water. The crystals were dried under reduced pressure (4 to 5.3 kPa) at 50\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 C. so that the water content was attained to not more than 3.5% by weight.

        "The positions of oxygen atoms of the water molecules were estimated from the electron density distribution. As the electron density distribution was examined, it was found that there are two sites near the center of symmetry in which probability of existence was high. This distance is 1.75 \u212b. From the comparison of this distance with a van der Waals radius for oxygen atom of 1.4 \u212b, it can be thought that it would be less likely that two oxygen atoms exist at a distance of 1.75 \u212b. Therefore, it is estimated that oxygen atom of the water molecule does not simultaneously exist one each at these two sites, but randomly (probably with time) in any of two sites.",

Additional 24 kg of methanol was added thereto, and the mixture was stirred to dissolve the crystals. One kilogram of decolorizing carbon was added thereto, and the mixture was stirred at 3.3\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes. The mixture was filtered at 3.4\u00b0 C., and thereafter 255 kg of ion-exchanged water was added in a thin stream to the filtrate over 45 minutes, and 80 g of seed crystals were added to the resulting mixture.
