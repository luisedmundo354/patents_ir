    "title": "Electromagnetic integrative door locking device",
    "abstract": "Described herein is a locking device which integrates mechanical components in a hollow metal door frame with electronic access components. The preferred embodiment comprises a magnetic field generating device, an appropriately shaped metal solenoid housing and a cam retaining locking bar attached to a hollow stem. The electronic components override the original mechanical components of the lock to create a fail-safe situation in which the original mechanical lock may be disabled. In the preferred embodiment, my upgraded locking device can be re-installed within a hollow door frame, thereby minimizing service costs and doorframe modification costs.",

        "This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/790,455 filed Feb. 22, 2001 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,745,603.",
        "My invention relates to the structure and operation of a previously installed mechanical door lock which is upgraded with override electromagnetic lock components. In particular my invention relates to electromagnetic locking components and deadbolt (or hook bolt), all of which are enclosed within a hollow doorframe casing. However, my new lock is also adaptable to other doors or other closed containers or spaces which require a fail-secure electronic locking component which overrides previously installed mechanical locking components.",
        "In the preferred embodiment, my integrated lock is best suited to narrow stile doors, such as doors generally comprised of a glass core with a surrounding hollow metal frame. The lateral longitudinal plate comprises a longitudinal surface from which the bar or bolt extends through a rectangular opening. In addition to this lateral longitudinal plate, my invention comprises anterior and posterior plates. A longitudinal edge of each anterior or posterior plate is attached to a corresponding edge of the lateral longitudinal plate and forms a three-sided enclosure with two right angles.",
        "In the preferred embodiment of my invention, the mechanical deadbolt operates from a fully extended position to a fully retracted position within the rectangular opening through an arc of 90 degrees. The operating mechanism comprises a rocking lever mounted perpendicular to the deadbolt. The rocking lever physically engages the deadbolt through pins and slot connections.",
        "The cylindrical lock in my preferred embodiment is of the conventional type operable by a key. This lock cylinder carries a cylindrical extended shaft in which the key is inserted. The cylindrical extended shaft comprises a rotating cam member that attaches to the extended shaft's interior end with two screws. The operator rotates this cylindrical extended shaft clockwise or counterclockwise by turning the key within it.",
        "The inner end of the deadbolt is bifurcated, and the legs formed therefrom contain arcuate shaped apertures. The legs are pivotally attached to the lower end of a rocking lever by a pivot pin which extends though the lower portion of the rocking lever. The rocking lever is physically positioned above the deadbolt and is adjacent to the lock cylinder.",
        "Two opposing roller cams are mounted on a sleeve, and the sleeve ends move in a limited manner within curved apertures within each anterior or posterior plate. Each of these apertures in each plate is arcuate and at its ends each has upwardly extending grooves. In operating the rocking lever, there is engagement of each opposing roller cam within each anterior and posterior plate and within the lever, by which each roller cam moves within the limits of a keyhole shaped aperture within the rocking lever.",
        "My invention does not change the function, purpose or intent of the prior art mechanical locking device: to secure the door against physical tampering. Instead, my new door lock provides a second level of security in addition to the conventional mechanical key method. With my new electromagnetic lock, a person (i) initially must have a card, fob or a correct code to enter onto a key pad, to (ii) subsequently release the keyed cylinder shaft for rotation.",
        "A second level of security is important when business owners confront certain days and/or hours in which it is difficult, impossible or very expensive for a locksmith to make a service call and re-key the locks. In contrast, with my invention the business owner easily recodes an access control device without requiring a professional locksmith.",
        "Installation of my invention alleviates this problem by addition of the following to the existing mechanical deadbolt or hook bolt:",
        "1) solenoid or other magnetic field generating device;",
        "2) a solenoid cylindrical casing which connects the solenoid to a prior mechanical installed lock component;",
        "3) a hollow stem inserted in the cavity of the solenoid cylindrical casing with a locking portion attached thereto; and",
        "4) a small spring between the hollow stem and hollow cavity within the solenoid cylindrical casing,",
        "The access control portion of the electronic portion of my invention includes:",
        "1) an exterior door or frame mounted reader (i.e, proximity, magnetic swipe, biometrics hand, finger or eye reader, bar code reader, Dallas touch chip reader, digital push button keypad reader, etc.);",
        "2) a door controller device which contains a circuit board, including but limited to memory e-prompt components, relay battery and wire connectors;",
        "3) a transformer power supply and the appropriate wire connecting components.",
        "When combined with stand alone or audit controlled computer based systems, such an access control system enables the business owner to create a report showing authorized employee access with the appropriate time and date. The door controller device identifies, via the reader, the previous entered information as to who can or cannot gain access. The door controller device can also electronically add or delete authorized users. The authorized person inserts his key, rotates the extendible shaft or pivot pin, and gains access only after the card access system has enabled the authorized person to gain access.",
        "When the door control time has expired, usually about five or six seconds) the power rapidly ceases, thereby preventing the key from turning within the exterior cylinder lock. To comply with relevant fire codes, the interior keyed cylinder lock (or non-keyed thumb turn) on the interior surface of the doorframe cannot be controlled by the cam retaining locking bar. The absence of cam retaining locking bar control thereby allows persons unrestricted egress from a room or building interior in emergencies.",
        "The process of installation of the electromagnetic component is another feature of my invention. My novel process of installation provides a significant economic advantage for, but not exclusively, commercial office space or privately owned businesses within large buildings. In these buildings, locks can be simultaneously upgraded with electronic security components without replacement or modification of a door component.",
        "In addition, with my invention no new apertures are cut into the hollow metal doorframe casing to accommodate more expensive magnetic lock or electric strike hardware. Using my process, the operator removes the lateral, anterior and posterior plates and inserts a solenoid and associated components within the hollow metal doorframe casing.",
        "The prior art discloses numerous mechanical locks cooperating with electrical components. However, these electrical components are not designed for installation after the mechanical locking component is installed within the doorframe. U.S. Pat. No. 5,561,997 (Milman) discloses a cylindrical barrel type lock wherein rotation of the barrel is prevented by one or more armatures. These armatures in turn are actuated by an electromagnet.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 5,542,274 (Thordmark et al.) discloses a cylinder lock comprising a key operated cylinder plug. A latching element is located near the boundary surface between the lock cylinder and a plug. There is also an electrical blocking element which moves between a release position and a blocking position. U.S. Pat. No. 3,733,861 (Lester) discloses an early electronic recognition door lock. Lester also comprises a solenoid which is activated to withdraw an abutment member from a laterally sliding door bolt mechanism. U.S. Pat. No. 5,469,727 (Spahn et al.) discloses an electronic lock cylinder comprising a housing with a cylindrical core.",
        "Electronic control circuits are coupled inductively via coils for transmission of coding information. There is separate assembly of the mechanical components and of the electronic components of the lock cylinder. Spahn's electronic lock cylinder differs in part from my pending invention in that there is no disclosure of a process which integrates the electronic and mechanical components after prior installation of the mechanical component within a door frame.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 5,136,870 (Gartner et al.) discloses an electronic door lock. A digitally operated code input pad assembly enters a first code and a second code to open a second lock mechanism with the door spring bolt. These locks are adaptable for replacement of an ordinary deadbolt lock mechanism. However, Gartner's lock does not provide for subsequent installation within a doorframe of only the electronic lock component at a minimum cost and destruction of the doorframe.",
        "Other early locks have even less technically in common with respect to upgrades with my present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 4,916,927 (O'Connell et al.) discloses a lock in which a solenoid can move an obstructing element entire into a recess. The presence or absence of the solenoid's magnetic field prevents turning of the shaft within a key cylinder. However, O'Connell's device must be installed with all its components simultaneously into a doorframe.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,831,851 (Larson) discloses a lock mechanism comprising a mechanical combination lock and an electronic lock. The mechanical combination lock serves as a fail-safe entry in case of failure of the electronic lock. However, this lock is specifically applicable to small safe deposit boxes.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,784 (Gartner) discloses an electronic dial combination lock. U.S. Pat. No. 3,748,878 (Balzano et al.), discloses an electrically controlled manual unit for a door lock. This lock also comprises a cylinder which contains a solenoid. The solenoid is energized to engage a clutch for rotation of the knob and connecting cam. Balzon's system, however, does not comprise an electronic component which can be installed subsequent to the mechanical lock unit within a door frame.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 5,636,880 (Miller)discloses an electronic lock which comprises a dead latch assembly for narrow stile locks, but not necessarily a hollow metal door frame casing comprising a door.",
        "No distinct solenoid housing, cylindrical solenoid casing, or cam retaining locking bar is disclosed as described by Applicant, infra.",
        "Furthermore, the operation of Miller's lock differs from that of Applicant's as it does not comprise a free standing electronically controlled obstructing component. In contrast, Applicant's electronically controlled element (cam retaining locking bar with attached stem and spring) rises within a magnetic field, and falls vertically in zero magnetic field.",
        "My locking devise integrates previously installed mechanical locks with electronically controlled components which override entry-authorizing mechanical lock components. In particular, my new electromagnetic lock easily replaces a previously installed mechanical deadbolt with an improved electromechanically controlled deadbolt or hookbolt. My new lock is especially suited for small business properties with numerous narrow stile deadbolts, but who require a \u201csecond level\u201d of electronic security. My lock installation also reduces costs and installation time from conventional locks with access control.",
        "The scope of my invention includes physical and mechanical modifications of a variety of existing electronic and mechanical locking systems. However, my preferred embodiment is that of electronic upgrades to the deadbolt key activated device described herein.",
        "The addition of a solenoid or equivalent electromagnetic device with a hollow stem and attached cam-retaining locking bar to any pre-existing mechanical lock is common to all embodiments of my invention, be it for doorframe casings or other egress entrance structures. In the preferred embodiment, the assembling operator attaches a solenoid/cam retaining locking bar above the mechanical locking components previously installed within a hollow metal doorframe casing.",
        "Accordingly, one purpose of my invention is to integrate mechanical lock components previously installed within hollow glass/metal door frames with a variety of existing or future access controlled locking devices, particularly those of a proximity access code reader variety.",
        "Another purpose of my invention is to lower the cost per door frame of upgrading existing mechanical locks with electronic security features, such as electric strikes and magnetic locks.",
        "Another purpose of my invention is to provide small businesses with hollow glass/aluminum doors to economically obtain secure and affordable access control locking devices to these doors.",
        "In addition, my new cam retaining locking bar greatly decrease a vandal's breakage of a locked door by wrenching the keyed cylinder with pliers or a wrench. These and other aspects of my invention will become apparent in the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and other embodiments of my invention.",

        "My electromagnetic integrated lock 1 comprises electromagnetic lock components with integrated prior art dead bolts 10 or hook bolts 10a. Each deadbolt 10 or hook bolt 10a was previously installed within a predetermined metal hollow doorframe casing 22 which comprises a door. The great advantage of my integrated lock is enhanced security without undue destruction of the existing hollow metal doorframe casing 22 and previously installed mechanical lock components.",
        "My integrative lock components fit within any hollow metal doorframe casing 22, but most preferably within a narrow stile glass core/aluminum doorframe casing. Other door frames with similar material, mechanical and other physical properties are also within the scope of my invention. Also included within my invention are integrated lock components for other securing and secured structures, such as safe deposit boxes or safes. These other secured structures must comprise the necessary space and wiring to place and connect the lock.",
        "My invention also comprises the method for installing an electromagnetic field generating device into a glass core/aluminum doorframe casing 22 containing a previously installed mechanical deadbolt 10 or hook bolt 10a. Using this method, the operator attaches a solenoid 1a and cam retaining locking bar 118b with hollow stem 118a above a pre-existing rocking lever 14 and deadbolt 10 within doorframe casing 22.",
        "My novel installation method and integrated lock system includes an access code proximity reader 302 and associated processor 313 in the preferred embodiment. Such prior art electronic components and their operative installation are well known to those in the electronic security/locksmithing industry. Existing non-electronic mechanical lock components which are compatible with my invention include, but not exclusively:",

As best seen in FIGS. 4a and 4c, hollow stem 118a does not function or comprise a piston, because pistons are solid cylinders or disks which move back and forth in a larger cylinder under fluid pressure.",
        "In the preferred embodiment, attached to hollow stem 118a is cam retaining locking bar 118b. Cam retaining locking bar 118b comprises a length 118aa, a width 118bb, and a thickness 118c. Cam retaining locking bar 118b also comprises a small army 118g and a small ovoid slot 118d which grips hollow stem 118a.

        "Tension from third spring 123 against cylindrical solenoid casing 1b tends to return hollow stem 118a and cam retaining locking bar 118b to a lower position. Compression of third spring 123 against cylindrical casing surface 1dd also prevents inadvertent permanent magnetization of hollow stem 118a. Third small spring 123 pushes downward upon hollow stem 118a and forces hollow stem 118a from top metal surface 1dd of cylindrical solenoid casing 1b.",

        "When solenoid 1a generates a magnetic field, its force lines are concentrated primarily through hollow solenoid cavity 1c. When this field presents within hollow solenoid cavity 1c, then cam retaining locking bar 118b moves vertically upward until attached hollow stem 118a is further within hollow solenoid cavity 1c. When power is added to solenoid 1a to generate a magnetic field, hollow stem 118a with attached cam retaining locking bar 118b elevates approximately \u215c inch.",
        "As seen in FIGS. 2c and 3b, cam retaining locking bar 118b now disengages rotating cam 56. In this upper position, cam retaining locking bar 118b no longer restricts rotating cam 56 from rotating downward. As a result, rotating cam member 56 is now unhindered and rotates away from its blocking position of extendible shaft 35. Force from rotating key 152 causes protruding member 56a to abut and exert force upon first opposing roller came 202 and second opposing roller cam 204 respectively.",
        "When force is exerted by rotating cam 56 upon opposing roller cams 202,204, lever pivot pin 50 slides downward within slot 37. At the same time, sleeve ends 210a, 210b move within curved apertures 86,88, and deadbolt pin 58 within slot 38 retracts deadbolt 10 to an open unlocked position, as described supra.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 3a, when voltage to solenoid 1a is discontinued, there is no magnetic field to elevate cam retaining locking bar 118b (and attached hollow stem 118a) vertically upward. Cam retaining locking bar 118b falls vertically downward to grasp protruding member 56a. Protruding member 56a physically blocks authorized key 152 from turning rotating shaft 35. First and second opposing roller cams 202, or 204(depending upon whether this is a right handed or left handed assembly) now cannot initiate the mechanical events which result in retraction of deadbolt 10.",

Again referring to FIG. 3(b), the electronic and mechanical components are in the default locked position when there is no magnetic field. Cam retaining locking bar 118b grips protruding member 56a rigidly so that rotating cam 56 prevents force upon opposing roller cams 202, 204.",
        "As a result, there is no force upon first and second opposing roller cams 202, 204 to initiate deadbolt 10 retraction. Consequently, electronically controlled cam retaining locking bar 118b overrides key 152 access, when there is no magnetic field to elevate cam retaining locking bar 118b to a non-gripping position.",

When reading device 302 detects electronic key card 301, card coil 307 within card 301 detects excitation signal 306 from reading device 302. Excitation signal 306 in turn generates a small current in card coil 307. This current powers a small integrated circuit within electronic key card 301, when card 301 contains a unique identification number.",

Each hollow metal doorframe casing 22 is precut for one particular back set. As a result, each back set distance is different, thus predetermining the exact dimensions of cam retaining locking bar 118b. Hollow metal doorframe casing 22 is also pre-cut with two one and \u00bc inch apertures 38a, 38b. Cylinder lock 66 and thumb turn 43 insert into these apertures respectively, after reinstallation of deadbolt 10, infra.",
        "Proper identification of the existing lock type is also important for a proper fit within anterior, posterior and lateral longitudinal plates 24, 26, 30 respectively. In addition, the operator determines door orientation, i.e., left handed or right handed. Determination of the left or right handed orientation of hollow metal doorframe casing 22 assures that the appropriate cylinder lock 66 for only an authorized key 152 has first rotating cam 56 attached to extended shaft 35.",
        "A right handed doorframe will have the lock on the right side of the door, when the operator is facing the doorframe casing's exterior surface. As seen in FIGS. 10a and 10b, in a left handed door swing, there is approximately \u215b inch offset towards large circular aperture 38a to the left.",
        "In a right handed door swing, there is approximately \u215b inch offset to the right towards large exterior circular aperture 38a. Similarly, a left-handed doorframe casing has the keyed lock on the left side of the exterior surface of the door, and the hinges on the right edge of the doorframe casing. Thumb turn 43 is unrestricted because there are no conventional key access pins or electronic access features. This lack of pins and electronic access is a requirement for fire and other safety ordinances in building codes.",
        "Whether a door is right handed or left handed is an initial determination well known to those in this particular industry. The modification of the width of cam retaining locking bar 118b (as well as that of solenoid 1a) does not affect the installation of my electromagnetic locking device with the following back sets: 31/32 inch; \u215e inch; one and \u215b inch; and one and \u2159 inch. Presently, a 1 and \u215b inch back set is the most marketed measurement in this particular industry.",
        "Opposite edge 118d of cam retaining locking bar 118b is precut or custom adjusted for each individual hollow doorframe casing's particular back set. The increased length of opposite edge 118d allows cam retaining locking bar 118b to fit within lateral longitudinal plate 30 and posterior solenoid housing opposing wall 150c.",
        "These two rigid vertical surfaces physically restrict cam retaining locking bar 118b from lateral movement. Lateral longitudinal plate 30 and opposing wall 150c also discourages attempts to force or jam cam retaining locking bar 118b. As seen in FIG. 10, door lock components are positioned above a typical prior art door handle 101a.",

He next checks for proper rotation of extendible shaft 35 by locking and unlocking now re-installed deadbolt 10 with key 152. After lock cylinder 66 and thumb turn are re-installed, the operator loosens temporary assisting screw 36b, allowing cam retaining locking bar 118a to grip rotating cam 56.",
        "Alternatively, an operator skilled in the art of locksmithing can partially prepare a hollow metal doorframe casing with components of a kit. In the best mode and preferred embodiment, each kit contains the following: pre-assembled solenoid 1a within cylindrical casing from Adams-Rite, solenoid housing 150, hollow member 118a, small spring 123 and cam retaining locking bar 118b. Electronic reader and processors 302,307 as well as electronic key cards 301 and related equipment could also be included within each kit and remain within the scope of my invention.",
        "In the preferred embodiment and best mode, each kit is intended for one doorframe per service call per operator. However, kits with varying numbers of installation components, or kinds of components are also within the scope of my invention. For example, some kits would only include a cam retaining locking bar 118b, hollow stem 118a, third spring 123, pre-assembled solenoid 1a from Adams-Rite\u00ae and solenoid housing 150.",
        "If a kit comprises the pre-assembled solenoid 1a, metal solenoid housing 150, hollow stem 118a, third spring 123, and cam retaining locking bar 118b, a person skilled in this particular art would require approximately one hour to install these new components as a retrofit. In this context, \u201cretrofit\u201d indicate the operator's use of Adams-Rite\u00ae dead bolts 10 or hook bolts 10a.",
        "These particular dead bolts and hook bolts immediately supra are compatible with Adams-Rite\u00ae glass/aluminum hollow doorframe casings 22, and are easily replaced by the operator's inventory in an emergency. The one-hour time frame, supra, includes the reinstallation of mechanical components rocking lever 14, deadbolt 10a, extension pins 202a, 204a, first and second opposing roller cams 202, 204 and rotating sleeve 210, and first and second springs 18a, 18b.",
        "This same time frame also includes insertion and attachment of cylindrical solenoid casing 1b within metal solenoid housing 150, cam retaining locking bar 1b, hollow stem 118a and their proper alignment; reinstallation of lateral longitudinal plate 30, anterior plate 24, posterior plate 26, and removal of large pin 192a and sleeve 192.",
        "An additional time of approximately two to three hours is necessary required to connect my integrated lock to Keri smart module 145(model IP 1000/2000) and proximity access code reader Cam retaining locking bar 118b is the least vulnerable point for physical damage, because cam retaining locking bar 118a physically blocks attempts to wrench lock cylinder 66 during unauthorized entry attempts.",
        "In addition, with my invention there is no irreparable cutting or physical alteration hollow metal door frame casing 22. Instead installation of cam retaining locking bar 118a and solenoid 1a preserves the physical integrity of the previously installed doorframe.",
        "My cam retaining locking bar 118b greatly maximizes circumvention of cylindrical lock 66, because it physically blocks intentional rotational motion even if cylinder lock 66 is destroyed. My cam retaining locking bar 118b also preserves the physical integrity of extending shaft 35. This damage occurs when the unauthorized third party uses a conventional screw driver to rotate extending shaft 35 through key aperture 35c.",
        "The retention of cylinder cam locking bar 118 fitting tightly around cylindrical lock shaft cam member 35a immediately slows and frustrates manual attempts to physically wrench the mechanical lock. Mechanical locks of the future can be upgraded for extra security with my new electromagnetic integrative security devices.",
        "The electronic override feature of my upgraded locking device from the access side of the door, does not affect the ability to immediately open the same hollow metal doorframe casing from its opposite side which faces the interior of the secured space, container or room. The opening of such a door frame casing by conventional devices as a thumb turn, is required by fire ordinances, supra. The thumb turn is completely removed from the electronic circuit required to override access, as opposed to egress.",
        "The description of my preferred embodiment in no way diminishes the scope or embodiments of my invention."
