        "This application claims priority to and is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application entitled, \u201cWater Curtain Apparatus and Method,\u201d filed Mar. 17, 2005, having a Ser. No. 11/081,735, now pending, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.",
        "The present invention relates generally to a water curtain apparatus. More particularly, the present invention relates to a film or sheet-type water curtain apparatus and method.",
        "Water from a reservoir running over a dam, in such a manner as to create a dispersion, is noted to produce aesthetically and acoustically pleasing effects, including a cooling effect as well as a change in humidity in areas nearby. It is noted that this same effect can be duplicated in an artificial waterfall by using a thin angled panel, and allowing water to run down the panel. This panel may also have indentures that cause a rippling effect in the falling water.",
        "Cooling our dwellings and workspace today is comprised of two subgroups primarily, heat exchange and evaporative cooling. Heat exchange air conditioning, the most popular, consumes large amounts of electricity, and uses chemicals to transport heat that are considered potentially harmful to the environment.",
        "In addition, heat exchange releases excess heat back into the environment, but recycles the same air over and over again. The \u201cswamp\u201d evaporative cooler is effectively a box containing a fan that draws air through saturated pads to provide cooling and a pump to keep the pads moist. It has remained the same for many decades.",
        "A variation of these subgroups uses evaporation to cool a heat exchanger then passes the cooled air through wet pads, thus reducing humidity. Limitations are inherent to ambient humidity reducing efficacy, and the large volumes of air that must be moved. The use of evaporative cooling and air conditioning when run simultaneously in an area cancel out their cooling benefits, since one introduces humidity and the other removes humidity. Neither of these will work in a passive way since both require energy from an external source.",
        "The recent popularity of misting systems shows that a need for cooling outdoor areas is desirable. These however release large volumes of water into the air and can saturate objects nearby. They are additionally prone to clogging due to mineralization and since they rely on high pressure to mist flooding can occur if compromised.",
        "Furthermore, indoor air purification systems require constant cleaning and electricity to function. These systems only clean air once it is inside by recirculation.",
        "Waterfalls such as those represented by the prior art allow water to collect in an upper reservoir, flow down an angled surface, and collect in a lower reservoir. The water is then re-circulated to the upper reservoir using a pump means, whereby the cycle may repeat.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 5,167,368 to Nash shows a waterfall providing a natural waterfall effect with accompanying acoustical effects.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 3,211,378 to Zysk is a wall fountain having a pool of water and a pump for raising water from the pool to a higher lever where it then falls over a vertical wall back into the pool.",
        "The waterfalls described previously, and others like them, all suffer from a number of distinct disadvantages, such as considerable water droplet splashing over a range of several feet from the base of the waterfalls; significant evaporation of water to the point that refill may be required daily; risk of water spillage during relocation of the waterfall; and a large base to house a lower reservoir and a means for returning water to the upper reservoir.",
        "Moreover, conventional decorative water or waterfall displays are typically constructed for indoor or outdoor use. These water or waterfall displays generally use a plurality of water chambers and wide, flat spouts to create thick and discontinuous streams of water that fall a short distance into the pool or spa below. One of the problems with such devices is that they are primarily designed for use with large volumes of water, which makes it difficult to use the devices in indoor water displays. Moreover, such prior art waterfall displays do not form a continuous film or layer of downwardly flowing water, but rather form thick, turbulent streams which tend to splash and are not particularly attractive as a decorative display. Additionally, the waterfall produced by such devices tends to separate into one or more generally cylindrical streams of water as it falls because of the strong surface tension of water that tends to pull the water flow together. Examples of such devices are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,881,280 to Lesikar; U.S. Pat. No. 5,537,696 to Chartier; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,738,280 to Ruthenberg.",
        "Decorative indoor water displays are known in the art. However, the known indoor water displays do not create an unsupported film or laminar sheet of water. Instead, such displays are characterized by flowing water over a solid or broken solid surface, such as an inclined or vertical plate. The water adheres to the plate surface as it cascades down. Such displays do not create a transparent film of water, but merely flow water over an existing structure to create a rippling effect. An example of such a device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,747,583 to Dunn et al.",
        "Indoor displays that are used to advertise oil are known in the art. One of the problems associated with the existing advertising display devices is that in order to function, they require the use of viscous fluids, such as lubricating oil. U.S. Pat. No. 1,689,790 to Lefevre, Jr. discloses an oil display device. Lefevre, Jr. however, is limited to maintaining a thin film of viscous liquid. The device relies on the high viscosity of the liquid displayed to create a film. Another problem associated with the Lefevre, Jr. device is that in order to maintain contact between the viscous liquid and two guides, it relies on forming the guides such that they converge at the bottom of the device. As a result of these deficiencies, the device disclosed would not be able to maintain a film of aqueous liquid. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 1,837,225 to Lipski discloses an oil display device for displaying cyclic movement of an oil film, and is adapted for use only with lubricating oils and other liquids with high molecular adhesion. The Lipski device is similarly not suited for low viscosity liquids, such as water or aqueous liquids which have low molecular adhesion and high molecular cohesion.",
        "The creation of water screens is not new and numerous procedures are already in use. However the apparatus and materials conventionally implemented present major drawbacks due to complexity of operation, restrictive dimensions, low mechanical ruggedness, bad endurance over time and vulnerability to bad weather.",
        "Accordingly, until now the proposed systems fail to meet a certain number of requirements. In contrast, the present invention presents a high degree of flexibility in terms of size and shape, and offers a great mobility at low construction and maintenance costs.",
        "The adaptability of the process is based on a combination of several significant innovations, such as air permeability and visual transparency thanks to the size of the net mesh; large span construction scalable in terms of both height and width lightness and tolerance thanks to multiple adjustment points; and low volume reservoirs thanks to a maximum water spread.",
        "Furthermore, it is well known to capture paint overspray whether as a liquid or as a powder by use of water curtains which are placed behind the substrate being painted. The water curtains are provided by directing water downward on a flat support to form a coherent sheet of water which catches the paint particles or droplets. Similarly, the present invention may be configured to passively filter air by placing the water curtain across an opening or passageway allowing filtered air to pass through while increasing its humidity, providing cooling effects and reducing the particulate matter therein.",
        "The devices disclosed in the aforementioned patents suffer from many deficiencies as described above. Accordingly, it is desirable, therefore, to provide a decorative, useful, educational, and preferably mobile indoor or outdoor waterfall/water curtain which utilizes a low viscosity liquid, such as water or other aqueous liquid, to form an attractive display of a continuous liquid film along a material drape in order to provide evaporative cooling and filtration of the ambient air.",
        "The foregoing needs are met, to a great extent, by the present invention, wherein in one aspect an apparatus is provided that in some embodiments may include a decorative, useful, educational, and preferably mobile indoor or outdoor waterfall/water curtain which utilizes a low viscosity liquid, such as water or other aqueous liquid, to form an attractive display of a continuous liquid film along a material drape in order to provide evaporative cooling and filtration of the ambient air.",
        "In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, an evaporative cooler comprises a housing having an upper surface and at least one vertical wall defining a chamber. The upper surface can include at least one opening in communication with the chamber. The evaporative cooler can also comprise at least one drain slit assembly for distributing a fluid and further comprise at least one screen. The at least one screen can define at least a portion of the at least one vertical wall and the at least one screen can have an interior surface and an exterior surface relative to the chamber. In addition, the at least one screen can be disposed relative to the at least one drain slit assembly such that the at least one drain slit assembly distributes the fluid over the screen. The at least one screen can be configured such that the fluid forms a surface fluid layer over the surfaces of the screen. The cooler can further comprise an air conveyor disposed within the housing. The air conveyor can be configured to draw air through the opening and into the chamber such that the air is conveyed through the screen and the fluid layer. The evaporator cooler can also comprise a base having a catch pool for catching the fluid flowing over the screen and a circulator configured for circulating the fluid back to the drain assembly from the catch pool. In one embodiment, the at least one screen defines a first screen and the cooler can include a second screen. The second screen can be disposed substantially parallel to the first screen such that air drawn into the chamber is conveyed through the second screen. In addition, the at least one drain slit assembly defines a first drain slit assembly and the evaporative cooler can further comprise a second drain slit assembly coupled to the second screen. The second drain slit assembly can be configured to distribute a fluid layer over the second screen. In yet another embodiment, the second screen can be disposed substantially parallel to the first screen such that the second screen serves as a barrier to the fluid layer.",
        "In another embodiment, an evaporative cooler can comprise a housing defining a chamber, air conveyor means configured to draw air into the chamber, drain means for distributing a fluid, and means for screening the air drawn into the chamber. The means for screening can be disposed relative to the drain means such that the fluid is distributed over the means for screening. The means for screening can be configured such that the fluid forms a surface fluid layer over the means for screening.",
        "In yet another embodiment according to the present invention, a method of evaporative cooling comprises drawing air into a chamber and conveying air through a screen. The screen can define a wall of the chamber. The method can further comprise distributing a fluid over a surface of the screen so as to form a surface fluid layer over the screen.",

There are, of course, additional embodiments of the invention that will be described below and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.",

As shown in FIG. 1, an embodiment in accordance with the present invention provides a water curtain or drape assembly 100 having a drape hood 105, material drape 110, float overflow shut-off 115, collection return 120, a drainage line solenoid 125 which preferably is electric, a drainage line 130, a filter 135, drape solenoid 140 which preferably is electric, a drape feed line 145, a pump 240, a pump power line 150, an on/off switch 155 to a power source 160 which preferably is a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) power line for obvious safety concerns, a feed line 165, and a shutoff valve 170.",
        "The present invention, wherein in one aspect provides that in some embodiments may include a decorative, useful and educational indoor waterfall which utilizes a low viscosity liquid, such as water or other aqueous liquid, to form an attractive display of a continuous liquid film along a material drape 110 between two limiting elements 105, 120. The material drape 110 may be porous or semi-porous and preferably made of a fiber glass mesh fabric.",
        "An embodiment of the present inventive apparatus and method is illustrated in FIGS. 1, 2A and 2B, wherein the material drape 100 is disposed within the hood 105 and suspended from the hood 105 towards the collection return 120. As water or other aqueous liquid is fed from feed line 165 to the drape feed line 145 into the hood 105, pump 240 via intake 245 pumps the water or other aqueous liquid into piston assembly 200 having a piston 203, a magnetic collar 205, a piston open position at 210, a gutter 255, a gutter drain slit 215, a gutter groove 220, a piston closed position at 225, an elastic cord 230 attached to piston 203, a drape material track 235, gutter drain 250, and a piston sleeve 260.",
        "The pumped liquid then pressurizes piston sleeve 260 thereby causing piston 203 to move longitudinally along sleeve 260 from the closed position 225 to the open position 210. The magnetic collar 205 may in effect assist in pulling the piston 203 to the open position by using a reverse polarity magnetic collar 205 to attract the piston 203. The elastic cord 230 assists in returning the piston to the closed position 225 upon the reduction or removal of liquid pressure within the piston sleeve 260 accordingly. Drain 250 allows liquid located between the pump 240 and piston 203 at the closed position 225 to be exhausted. Drain slit 215 allows liquid to flow from the piston sleeve 260 into the gutter 255 via the gutter groove 220 and into the material track 235. Once the liquid begins to fill the material track 235, liquid will accumulate and flow upon the material drape 110 disposed within the track 235 in the direction of the collection return 120.",
        "The water or other aqueous liquid may flow downward over the material drape 110 and through one side or both sides of the material drape 110, including a wicking effect for upward and downward flows while allowing ambient air to pass through. It should be noted that if a laminar flow of water or other aqueous liquid over the surfaces of the material drape 110 is created or controlled by the speed or velocity of pump 240, evaporation will occur, but the excess moisture while slightly restricting or controlling air movement will have the added benefit of \u201cscrubbing\u201d the air as it moves through the flowing water. This benefit may reduce pollutants, allergens, insects and the like. The gutter 255 may be filled manually without the use of pump 240 in some embodiments (not shown). The collection return 120 may either be independent or attached to a recirculation system as shown. The inline filter 135 may remove contaminants picked up during the movement of the water or other aqueous liquid.",
        "An ionizing element (not shown) may be incorporated inline to create pH changes in the water or other aqueous liquid for sterilizing purposes. 100461 The drape 110 may be mounted for vertical or horizontal movement or retraction or mounted in a fixed manner. If vertically mounted, the drape 110 may roll to the side or fold when not being utilized. If horizontally mounted as shown in FIG. 1, the drape 110 may roll or fold upward or downward with respect to the horizontal.",
        "The drape assembly 100 may include an inline heating element (not shown) to increase the temperature of the water or other aqueous liquid.",
        "Referring to FIG. 3, an embodiment of the present inventive apparatus and method provides a pivotal window drape assembly 300 having pivot hinges 305, a latch 310, a fixed screen drape material 315, a drain opening 320, mounting frame 325, tubing 330, a high volume pump 335, collection tray 340, collection tray float 345, overflow float valve 350, solenoid reservoir drain 355, a pump power line 360, an on/off switch 365 to a power source 370 which preferably is a GFCI power line.",
        "In this embodiment the window drape assembly 300 opens inwards within a building or structure and utilizes a high volume pump 335 to create a waterfall effect upon the fixed screen material 315. This waterfall effect provides for a degree of privacy as well as a measurable amount of humidity to interior spaces as air may be allowed to pass.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4, an embodiment of the present inventive apparatus and method provides a walled drape assembly 400 having a slit 405; a gutter 410; a pump 415; a water main 420; a material drape 425; a reservoir/catch basin 430 having sidewalls 450, drainage openings 460 and an overflow level indicator 455; a float 435; a catch basin solenoid drain 440; a catch basin overflow region 445; a swivel pump connector 465; a water main solenoid 470; a pump contact switch 475; a feed line 480; and a one-way valve 485.",
        "The walled drape assembly 400 is configured to be set back into a wall. The swivel connector 465 allows for some flexibility in setting the assembly 400 into a well as desired. The contact switch 475 turns on the pump 415 either manually or remotely as desired. The water main 420 provides water or other aqueous liquid to the pump 415 and is controlled by solenoid 470. The catch basin 430 retrieves and circulates the water or other aqueous liquid via the feed line 480. There is a one-way valve disposed inline with the feed line 480 to prevent backflow to the catch basin 430. The catch basin 430 utilizes a solenoid drain 440 in combination with float 435 to sense and prevent overflow conditions of the basin 430. The gutter 410 receives the liquid from pump 415 and the liquid subsequently flows from slit 405 onto drape 425 accordingly. The drape 425 may be retractable by use of an elastic spring or stock spring or both (not shown) depending on the size and length of the drape 425 used. A manually operated embodiment has no pump but may use a seeper hose which moistens the drape 425 and then fills the catch basin 430. However, the catch basin 430 may overflow and therefore requires manual draining via drain 440.",
        "Referring to FIG. 5, an embodiment of the present inventive apparatus and method provides a water curtain assembly 500 having a water gutter 505, a water drainage slit 510, a material drape 515, hydraulic telescopic piston sleeves 520, a drape storage cavity 525, a water inlet 535, a plurality of return drains 540, and a diverter pump or dedicated pump 545 as desired.",
        "The connection between the water gutter 505 and the piston sleeves 520 may be configured at a ninety degree angle thereby reducing the flow of water or other aqueous liquid to gutter 505 and subsequently to slit 510. This embodiment may be applicable to hot tubs and the like. A diverter pump or dedicated pump 545 may provide pressurized water for a hot tub or other primary source 530 to piston sleeves 520 thereby causing the sleeves 520 to expand telescopically from an initial position to a desired height or length. As the piston sleeves 520 expand, the drape 515 may freely unravel and move upward with the sleeves 520. The water or other aqueous liquid will propagate within the sleeves 520 into the gutter 505 and out the slit 510 upon the drape 515 creating a water curtain effect. When the water pressure from the pump lessens or ceases the piston sleeves 520 will lower and return to the initial position and the drape 515 will reside and be disposed within storage cavity 525 accordingly. The water or other aqueous liquid propagating down the drape 515 may be recycled through a plurality of return drains 540 back to the hot tub or primary source 530.",
        "Although an example of the water curtain is shown using a fiber glass mesh drape, it will be appreciated that other structured materials can be used. Also, although the water curtain is useful to increase humidity in the air flow it can also be used to create insect barriers, sound baffling or barriers, privacy screens or fences, reflect indirect light, grab dust or allergens, perform active cooling with forced air flows, and/or passive cooling with air flows alone.",
        "An illustrative embodiment of an active evaporative cooler and air purifier is shown in FIG. 6. The evaporative cooler 600 can include a housing 602 having an upper surface 604 and at least one vertical wall 606 defining an interior chamber (not shown). In addition, the evaporative cooler 600 can include a base 608 for supporting the housing 602. The base 608 can be configured with casters 610 or any other device so as to permit the evaporative cooler 600 to be easily mobile for transport from location to location. The evaporative cooler 600 can be disposed outdoors, for example to cool a patio area, or the cooler 600 can be mounted in a window or entryway for outdoor to indoor evaporative cooling of a building or enclosure. The evaporative cooler can further include the electrical circuitry and piping previously described to provide the power, safety and drainage features described in connection with the previous embodiments.",
        "The evaporative cooler 600 can be generally configured for active cooling in which the surrounding ambient air can be forced drawn into and expelled from the housing 602. Accordingly, the upper surface 604 can include one or more slots or vents 612 through which ambient or surrounding air can be drawn into the inner chamber of the housing 602. Vents 612 are shown as running in the longitudinal direction of the housing 602, but other configurations are possible such as, for example, running in the transverse direction of housing 602 or being located on a vertical wall 606 of the housing 602. The air drawn into the housing 602 can be filtered, humidified and cooled by being passed through a material drape or screening element 614 disposed along a vertical wall 606 of the housing 602 with a fluid layer flowing over the surface of the screening element 614. The screening element 614 can be disposed within vertical wall 606 so as to be framed in a portion of the vertical wall 606 or alternatively, the screen element can be secured within the framework of the housing 602 such that the screen 614 substantially forms the vertical wall 606 in its entirety. The screen 614 can be further disposed so as to be substantially parallel to the vertical wall 606 or alternatively, the screen 614 can be positioned so as to be at an angle relative to the vertical wall 606. As is described in greater detail below, the screening element 614 can be coupled to a drain assembly such that a fluid can be moved over the screen 614 so as to filter, humidify and/or cool the air passing through the screening element 614.",
        "The housing 602 is shown as being substantially block rectangular or prism-like in shape. Accordingly, the housing 602 shown in FIG. 6 includes four supporting vertical walls 606. In one embodiment of the evaporative cooler 600, the vertical walls 606 defining the elongate sides of the housing 602 can be configured with a screen 614 so as to form parallel evaporative cooling screens. Alternatively, only one of the parallel screens 614 can be configured for evaporative cooling in which the fluid layer is conveyed over the one screen. The other of the parallel screen element 614 can be configured to act as a drape, shield or barrier to minimize or reduce the scatter of fluid around and/or external to the housing 602 that may be dispersed by air moving over the one evaporative cooling screen. Further, each vertical wall 606 of the evaporative cooler 600 can include a screen 614 or further in the alternative, a single vertical wall 606 can include a screening element 614. Generally, the evaporative cooler 600 can be fitted with as many screens 614 as can be effectively coupled to or in communication with the drain assemblies of the evaporative cooler 602 so as to provide the evaporative cooling and filtering effects as described below.",
        "Shown in FIG. 7 is a cross-sectional view of the evaporative cooler 600 in which the upper surface 604 and the vertical walls 606 can define an interior chamber 616. Each of the parallel elongate vertical walls 606 of the housing 602 has a screening element 614. The screening element 614 defines an interior surface and an exterior surface relative to the interior chamber 616. The screening element 614 can be configured as a single layer element. Moreover, the screening element 614 can be constructed by weaving, pressing or other forming process so as to form the single layer element.",
        "The screening element 614 can be further constructed and disposed within the housing 602 so as to permit air to flow from the interior chamber 616 to the outer environment. The screening element 614 can define a mesh opening size so as to provide an airflow suitable for a given application of cooler 600. For example, the screen 614 can include a mesh opening ranging from about 1/64 inch to about \u215c inch, although other mesh sizes are possible, as required to produce the desired evaporative cooling effect and fluid flow characteristics for air passing through and fluid flowing over the screen element 614. More specifically, the mesh size of the screen element 614 can be configured so as to alter the pressure or air volume requirements of the cooler 600. For example, where the mesh size of the screen element is \u00bc inch, the cooler 600 may not need a large air conveyor to move air through the screens 614 as compared to a cooler 600 configured with a screen element 614 having a smaller mesh size. In addition, the mesh openings of the screen element 614 can be sized and configured so as to effect the fluid flowing over the screen 614. The screen element 614 can be generally configured such that fluid dispensed over the screen 614 forms a two-dimensional or surface fluid layer. Where the screen element 614 is configured as a single layer element and fluid flow is restricted to the surface of the screen 614, the wet bulb temperature of the ambient air can be optimized or maintained over a longer period of time so as to deliver sustained evaporative cooling of the air. In addition, the screen 614 can be configured such that fluid flowing over the screen 614 defines a decorative pattern that can be aesthetically pleasing. Moreover, the screen 614 can be constructed from a translucent material such that, in combination with the transparent/translucent fluid layer flowing over the screen 614, a translucent barrier can be defined to provide privacy and adequate lighting to an area framed or fenced by the evaporative cooler 600. To facilitate the visual effects provided by the screen 614 and the fluid flowing thereover, the housing can be constructed from translucent material.",
        "The upper portion of the housing 602 can define a hood basin area 618. The hood basin area 618 can include an air conveyor 620 disposed and configured for drawing air into the chamber 616 through vents 612. The air conveyor 620 can be, for example, a fan or similar device configured to rotate about an axis substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the housing 602. The air conveyor 620 can provide the force for expelling the air from the chamber 616 through the screening elements 614. Moreover, the air conveyor 620 can provide the positive pressure within the chamber 616 such that air moving through the evaporator 600 moves from the inner chamber 616 to the outer environment. Where the screen 614 has been configured so as to minimize the size requirements of the air conveyor 620, the noise generated by the air conveyor 620 can be minimized or reduced so as not to disrupt the surrounding environment.",
        "The hood area 618 can further provide an area from which the screening elements 614 can be supported and coupled to or in communication with drain slit assemblies 622. Drain slit assemblies 622 can be configured and disposed relative to the screens 614 to provide a controlled flow of fluid such as, for example, water over the screens 614. The drain slit assemblies 622 can be configured, for example, in a manner substantially similar to the piston sleeve and gutter assembly of FIG. 2B. Accordingly, each of the drain slit assemblies 622 can be coupled to or disposed relative to a screen element 614 so as to deposit a fluid film or surface fluid layer over the screen 614. The screen 614 can be coupled to or in communication with the drain slit assembly 622 such that the fluid film can be deposited on either the interior or exterior surface of the screen 614, or alternatively on both the interior and exterior surfaces of the screen 614 so as to define the surface fluid layer. In addition, the drain slit assembly 622 can be configured and coupled or disposed relative to the screen element 614 such that the fluid layer has a continuous laminar flow over the screening element 614. Thus air passing through the vents 612 of the evaporative cooler 600 can be conveyed through the screen elements 614 and the flowing fluid layer so as to be filtered and humidified for delivery into the external environment. The fluid layer flowing over the screen elements 614 can be collected in a re-circulating pool 624 formed within the base 608. The screen 614 is shown in-part in FIG. 7 for ease of viewing to illustrate that the screen elements 614 can be configured so as to extend into the re-circulating pool 624 thereby minimizing spill over or splashing of the fluid outside of the housing 602. A pumping device 626 can further be disposed within the base 608 to circulate the collected fluid back to the drain slit assemblies 622 through fluid return piping 628. Alternatively, the cooling unit 600 can derive its fluid source externally. More specifically, the cooling unit 600 can be disposed within, for example, a pool of water, with the base 608 and pumping device in communication with the pool of water to deliver the fluid to the drain slit assemblies 622.",
        "Shown in FIG. 8 is an illustrative embodiment of the hood area 618. More specifically shown are the drain assemblies 622 coupled to or disposed relative to the screen elements 614 for distributing fluid over the screen 614. Each drain assembly 622 can include return piping 628 feeding circulated fluid from the re-circulating pool 624 into the fluid holding area 630 of the drain slit assembly 622. The drain slit assembly 622 can include a slit 632 configured to secure the screen element 614 and through which fluid can flow onto the screen element 614. Alternatively, the screen 614 can be secured to a portion of the hood area 618 and spaced relative to the drain slit assembly 622 such that fluid can be discharged from the slit 632 and dispersed over the screen 614. The rate of the fluid flow over the screen element 614 can be controlled by, for example as earlier described, the velocity of the pumping mechanism 626. Alternatively, the drain slit assembly 622 can include a pump independent of pumping mechanism 626 to deliver and control the fluid flow over the screen element 614. Further in the alternative, the flow characteristics of the fluid layer over the screening element 614 can depend upon the head pressure of fluid above the slit 632 and the geometry of the slit 632. Schematically shown in FIG. 8 is the air flow through the hood portion 618 of the evaporative cooler 600.",
        "The housing and the base of the evaporative cooler and air purifier can be any geometry, for example, circular cylindrical as is shown in FIG. 9. FIG. 9 shows an alternative illustrative embodiment of the evaporative cooler 700 having both a housing 702 substantially circular cylindrical in shape. The housing 702 can include an upper surface 704 and a vertical or side wall 706 defining an interior chamber (not shown). The upper surface 704 of the evaporative cooler 700 can include one or more vents 712 through which the outside air can pass into the interior chamber for active or passive cooling. The vents 712 are shown as concentric arcs spaced about the upper surface 704, but the vents 712 can be disposed about the upper surface 704 in other formations. The vertical wall 706 defining the cylindrical shape of the housing 702 can be formed substantially by the material drape or screening material 714. Fluid can be distributed over the screen 714 for filtration and /or evaporative cooling of the air drawn into the interior chamber. Alternatively, the vertical wall 706 can include a series of spaced apart windows for framing two or more screens 714. The screen 714 can be disposed so as to be substantially parallel to the vertical wall 706 or alternatively, the screen 714 can be positioned so as to be at an angle relative to the vertical wall 706. Moreover, the screen 714 can be constructed and configured in a manner substantially similar to screen element 614 so as to have substantially similar fluid flow characteristics and light transmitting effects. More specifically, screen 714 can be configured such that fluid flowing over the screen 714 forms a two-dimensional or surface fluid layer over the screen 714. The evaporative cooler 700 can further include a base 708. The base 708 can include casters 716 or similar device to make the evaporative cooler 700 mobile.",

The drain slit assembly 722 can be further configured such that the fluid film has a laminar flow over the screening element 714. The drain slit assembly 722 can be configured in a manner substantially similar to the drain slit assembly 622 and further configured as a continuous ring circumscribed by the hood basin area 718. Alternatively, the drain slit assembly can be a series of spaced apart segmented ring portions to provide the fluid flow. The screen 714 can be coupled to or disposed relative to the drain assembly 722 in a manner as previously described regarding the screen 614 and the drain slit assemblies 622 of the evaporator 600. Although not shown, with the evaporative screen 714 having a fluid layer disposed thereover, a secondary screen can be provided to parallel or circumscribe the screen 714 to act as a shield or barrier to minimize or reduce the scatter of fluid around and/or external to the housing 702 that may be dispersed by air moving over the evaporative cooling screen 714.",
