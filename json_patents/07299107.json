    "abstract": "A method for analyzing polishing frequency and number of polishing times for chemical planarization polishing wafer with different polishing pad profiles is disclosed. First, drawings of a wafer and a polishing pad are provided and then are converted into pixel arrays. Pixel arrays are processed to be black/white images. The black/white images are converted into binary matrices. The effective polishing frequencies of all points in the binary matrix are calculated. Following the calculated polishing frequencies, the coordinates of all binary matrices are redefined according to a displacement condition, and then new coordinates of all points and corresponding effective numbers of polishing times for a time increment are calculated so as to form an effective polishing times matrix for the time increment. Further, all effective numbers of polishing times within a total polishing time interval are added together.",

        "The present application is based on, and claims priority from, Taiwan Application Serial Number 94112618, filed Apr. 20, 2005, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.",
        "1. Field of Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a method for analyzing a polishing frequency and a number of polishing times. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for analyzing an effective polishing frequency and an effective number of polishing times for chemical mechanical planarizing a wafer with different polishing pad profiles.",
        "2. Description of Related Art",
        "Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is a global planarization technique which employs both of a mechanical polishing by polishing media and a chemical polishing by chemical solution to remove particles on a wafer surface so that subsequent processes such as deposition and etching are successful. As global planarization is a basic requirement for multilevel interconnects and CMP is recognized as a feasible way to globally planarize a wafer, CMP is very commonly used in semiconductor processes.",
        "In the conventional planarization analyzing technique for a wafer processed by CMP, a finite element method is often used for evaluating a pressure field distribution during polishing. A speed distribution can be obtained from relative velocity between any point on the wafer and a polishing pad, derived by a relative rotating speed. There are also experimental efforts to derive a relation between a speed distribution and a removal rate.",
        "In a typical CMP method, the speed distribution is evaluated under a condition of a planet path and an identical rotating speed for the wafer and the polishing pad. In the case of other relative rotating speeds, an averaged speed distribution is often used. As to compensating chemical mechanical wafer polishing with the wafer disposed above the pad, if the planet path is employed and the wafer and the polishing pad have an identical rotating speed, a distribution of a number of polishing times on the wafer surface is uneven due to the polishing pad incompletely covering the wafer, so that a good planarization cannot be obtained.",
        "Unfortunately, evaluation of the relative speed is based on complex principles and has the following difficulties. Evaluation of the speed for compensating chemical mechanical planarization involves complicated integration, and evaluation of the number of polishing times is difficult, especially for a non-circular polishing pad.",
        "Implementation of global planarization detection is also difficult. For an ordinary chemical mechanical wafer polishing, certain measurement positions on which an endpoint detector measures are selected indirectly. For compensating chemical mechanical wafer polishing, although the polishing surface of the wafer faces upward, which helps a direct measurement during polishing, the available number of measurement positions is still limited and the global planarization detection is not easily achieved because global planarization effect is related to an effective polishing frequency or an effective number of polishing times of all points on the wafer.",
        "For the foregoing reasons, a method for analyzing the effective polishing frequency and the effective number of polishing times for chemical mechanical wafer polishing is needed, providing a reference to the distribution of the effective number of polishing times after chemical mechanical wafer polishing for a period of time.",
        "It is therefore an objective of the present invention to provide a method for analyzing polishing frequency and the number of polishing times of a wafer surface for evaluating an effective polishing frequency and an effective number of polishing times by an ordinary CMP or a compensating CMP.",
        "It is another objective of the present invention to provide a method for analyzing polishing frequency and the number of polishing times of a wafer surface for evaluating an effective polishing frequency and an effective number of polishing times of a wafer surface with different polishing pad profiles and different relative speeds.",
        "It is another objective of the present invention to provide a method for analyzing polishing frequency and the number of polishing times of a wafer surface for evaluating an effective polishing frequency and an effective number of polishing times of a wafer surface when a polishing pad acts upon the wafer along an planet path.",
        "It is another objective of the present invention to provide a method for analyzing polishing frequency and the number of polishing times of a wafer surface for predicting an unevenness of a wafer surface, possibly from an uneven polishing frequency, and lowering a detecting range needed for an endpoint detection.",
        "In accordance with the foregoing and other objectives of the present invention, a method for analyzing a polishing frequency and the number of polishing times of a wafer surface is provided. In a preferred embodiment, the method includes providing drawings of a polishing pad and a wafer; converting the drawings into respective pixel arrays; processing the pixel arrays to be black/white images; converting the black/white images into numeric matrices; and converting the numeric matrices into binary matrices. Then, the origin is located at upper left corner (0,0), as shown in FIG. 1B.",
        "The method further comprises redefining coordinates of the binary matrices, which includes setting the coordinate of the wafer center as an origin (0,0) of a new coordinate system and translating the wafer and the polishing pad to unite two coordinate systems in a new united coordinate system; calculating new coordinates and polishing frequencies of all points for a time increment (\u0394t) to form at least a polishing frequency; determining whether an effective wafer polishing occurs and calculating effective numbers of polishing times for all points; forming an effective polishing times matrix for the time increment \u0394t; and transforming the coordinate of the effective polishing times matrix back into a starting coordinate and adding all corresponding effective numbers of polishing times of each point in respective effective polishing times matrices within a total polishing time interval t on a basis of superposition.",
        "In conclusion, the method of the present invention provides a simple way to evaluate a distribution of the effective number of polishing times in a predetermined path and a time interval by transforming drawings of a wafer and a polishing pad into binary images and implementing superposition of effective numbers of polishing times. The present invention is applicable to an analysis of effective polishing frequency and effective number of polishing times by an ordinary CMP or a compensating CMP without limitation to specific polishing pad profiles or polishing paths. Therefore, the method is advantageous to designing more practical polishing pad profiles.",
        "It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are by examples and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.",
        "These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims and accompanying drawings where:",

        "The method of the present invention analyzes distributions of an effective polishing frequency and an effective number of polishing times for a wafer with various polishing pad profiles and utilizes a numeric mode of a designed profile through an image process to fulfill the analysis. Regardless of the pattern of the polishing pad, the effective polishing frequency and the effective number of polishing times are evaluated for a wafer with different polishing pad profiles by a polishing pad numeric matrix.",
        "The polishing frequency in the invention is defined as follows. An effective polishing refers to an actual contact between the wafer and the polishing pad. Abrasive particles are assumed to be uniformly spread on the polishing pad and the diameters of the abrasive particles are assumed not to change after contacting the wafer. The number of abrasive particles passing a position on the wafer per unit time is defined as the polishing frequency, expressed as F(i,j), which represents the relative speed between the wafer and the polishing pad divided by the original particle diameter of the abrasive.",
        "The number of polishing times for each point on the wafer is defined as the total amount of abrasive particles passing the point within a time interval. For example, during contact between the wafer and the polishing pad, the number of polishing times is taken to be one when one abrasive particle passes a point on the wafer surface.",
        "Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the description to refer to the same or like parts. It should be noted that, in all figures, reference number (1) denotes a wafer, reference number (2) denotes a polishing pad and reference number (3) denotes a compensating polishing head. FIG. 1A shows a compensating chemical mechanical planarization system. In the figure, the polishing pad (2) and the compensating polishing head (3) are all situated above the wafer (1).",
        "FIG. 2 is a flow chart of a method for analyzing an effective polishing frequency and an effective number of polishing times in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In the embodiment, an effective polishing frequency and an effective number of polishing times are determined for a compensating CMP with a planet polishing path and various polishing pad profiles.",
        "A movement path of the wafer with respect to the polishing pad in the compensating CMP system is chosen to be a planet path, wherein a relative speed between the wafer and the polishing pad is determined by U=\u221a{square root over (Rp2(\u03c9w\u2212\u03c9p)2 cos\u03b8p2+D\u03c9p2wp2)}, where (Rp,\u03b8p) denotes a coordinate of a point on the wafer, Ww and Wp are rotating speeds of the wafer and the polishing pad, and Dwp is a distance between centers of the wafer and the polishing pad.",

A computer aided design (CAD) software, such as AUTOCAD\u00ae, can be employed to design a wafer drawing and the polishing pad drawing subject to actual dimensions. The profile of the polish pad may be any shape such as circular, elliptic or triangular. Reference is also made to FIG. 3, which illustrates 250\u00d7250-pixel drawings of the wafer and the polishing pad in a preferred embodiment. In the figure, a wafer and polishing pad drawing 300 is shown with an elliptic polishing pad and a circular wafer.",
        "In a step 104, the CAD drawings are converted into images of P\u00d7Q pixel arrays, where P and Q are positive integers. An image processing software can be utilized to get converted CAD images from the CAD drawings.",
        "In a step 106, the CAD images of the wafer and the polishing pad are converted into respective black/white images relative to the unchanged proportion of the wafer area to the polishing pad area. By the image processing software, CAD images can be processed and converted into a BMP image format.

After converting, the origins of the coordinates of the matrices are each located at the upper left corner individually. Reference is also made to FIGS. 4A and 4B, showing black/white images of the wafer and the polishing pad and coordinates thereof.",
        "In a step 110, the numeric matrices are converted into binary matrices. By replacing all matrix values in the white area with 1 and maintaining all matrix values in the black area as 0, binary matrices of the wafer and the polishing pad are obtained. Thus, as shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B, a solid area is denoted by 1 and a void area is denoted by 0.",
        "In a step 112, the coordinates of the binary matrices are redefined, wherein a coordinate of a matrix refers to coordinates for all elements in the matrix as a whole; for example, a new coordinate of a matrix means that each element in the matrix has a new coordinate distinguished from the old one. Referring to FIG. 2A, which illustrates a flow chart of redefining the coordinate in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the step 112 includes a step 112a, setting the wafer center as an origin of a new coordinate system, (0,0), and a step 112b, translating the wafer and the polishing pad and redefining the coordinates of the binary matrices of the wafer and the polishing pad in terms of Cartesian coordinate by uniting two independent coordinate systems of the binary matrices into a new united coordinate system.",
        "The method of the present invention further includes a step 114, determining a presence of an effective polishing after rotating degrees of \u0394\u03b8 for at least a time increment(\u0394t). Because a binary matrix value of 1 means a material presence, an actual polishing occurs only when both of the polishing pad binary matrix value pad(i,j) and the wafer binary matrix value wafer(i,j) are equal to one.",

When any point rotates from (i,j) to (i\u2032,j\u2032) on the basis of the wafer and the polishing pad, taking wafer(cx,cy) and pad(cx,cy)as a rotating center respectively, whether an effective polishing occurs is determined by multiplying a new wafer binary matrix value Nwafer(i\u2032,j\u2032) by a new polishing pad binary matrix value Npad(i\u2032,j\u2032). Therefore, the effective polishing frequency matrix can be expressed as [FF(i\u2032,j\u2032)]P\u00d7Q=[Npad(i\u2032,j\u2032)\u00d7Nwafer(i\u2032,j\u2032)\u00d7F(i,j)]P\u00d7Q.

        "Referring again to FIG. 2B, which shows a flow chart of forming an effective polishing times matrix in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, step 116 includes steps 116a\u02dc116d, wherein a value of a starting effective polishing times matrix for the time increment \u0394t is determined.

        "In the step 116b, an effective polishing frequency and an effective number of polishing times for a point displacing from (i,j) to (i\u2032,j\u2032) is calculated and expressed as follows.\n\nFT(i\u2032,j\u2032)=Npad(i\u2032,j\u2032)\u00d7Nwafer(i\u2032,j\u2032)\u00d7F(i,j)\u00d7\u0394t, \n\nwhere Npad(i\u2032,j\u2032)\u00d7Nwafer(i\u2032,j\u2032)=0 or 1, and F(i,j) is the polishing frequency.

After transformation, each matrix takes a starting position of the rotation of the wafer as a basis, so that effective polishing times matrices for all time increments can be added together in a proper way. For example, when the wafer rotates \u0394\u03b8w about its rotating center in the time increment \u0394t, the effective polishing times matrix \u2514FTi\u2032j\u2032\u2032\u2518P\u00d7Q is transformed back into the starting effective polishing times matrix \u2514FTk (ij)k\u2518P\u00d7Q according to a rotating angle \u2212\u0394\u03b8w.",

The effective polishing times matrices for all time increments \u0394t are added together, where the sum of all time increments \u0394t is a total polishing time interval t, and then a total effective polishing times matrix \u2514sumFTk ij\u2518P\u00d7Q is obtained for the total polishing time interval t.",
        "Assuming that a point rotates from (i,j)1 to (i\u2032,j\u2032)1 in a first time increment \u0394t, for a second time increment, the rotation starts with a coordinate (i,j)2, which is taken to be (i\u2032,j\u2032)1; and the point rotates from (i,j)2 to (i\u2032,j\u2032)2 during the second time increment. Then, (i\u2032,j\u2032)2 is transformed back to (i,j)2, as indicated in the step 116d. According to the same logic, for a third time increment, the point rotates from (i\u2032,j\u2032)2 to (i\u2032,j\u2032)3 and so on, such that incremental rotations are implemented from (i,j)n to (i\u2032,j\u2032)n.",
