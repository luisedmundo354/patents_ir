        "Botanical designation: Helenium hybrida.",
        "Cultivar denomination: \u2018Ruby Tuesday\u2019.",
        "The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Helenium plant, botanically known as Helenium hybrida, and hereinafter referred to by the name \u2018Ruby Tuesday\u2019.",
        "The new Helenium is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the Inventor in Hillegom, The Netherlands. The objective of the program is to create and develop new Helenium cultivars with double inflorescence form, sterile flowers and a long flowering period.",
        "The new Helenium originated from a cross-pollination by the Inventor in 1998 of two unnamed selections of Helenium hybrida, not patented. The new Helenium was discovered and selected by the Inventor as a single flowering plant within the progeny of the stated cross-pollination in a controlled environment in Hillegom, The Netherlands in 1999.",
        "Asexual reproduction of the new Helenium by terminal cuttings in a controlled environment in Hillegom, The Netherlands since 1999, has shown that the unique features of this new Helenium are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations.",
        "The cultivar Ruby Tuesday has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature, daylength and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype.",
        "The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of \u2018Ruby Tuesday\u2019. These characteristics in combination distinguish \u2018Ruby Tuesday\u2019 as a new and distinct cultivar of Helenium: \n\n    \n    \n        1. Upright, somewhat outwardly spreading and uniform plant habit.\n        2. Moderately vigorous growth habit.\n        3. Freely flowering habit.\n        4. Inflorescences with dark red-colored ray florets.\n        5. Strong peduncles that hold the inflorescences above the foliar plane.",
        "In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Hillegom, The Netherlands, plants of the new Helenium differed from plants of the parent selections primarily in plant form as plants of the new Helenium were more compact than plants of the parent selections.",
        "Plants of the new Helenium can be compared to plants of the Helenium cultivar Rubinzwerg, not patented. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Hillegom, The Netherlands, plants of the new Helenium differed from plants of the cultivar Rubinzwerg in the following characteristics:\n\n    \n    \n        1. Plants of the new Helenium were more compact than plants of the cultivar Rubinzwerg.\n        2. Plants of the new Helenium were more freely flowering than plants of the cultivar Rubinzwerg.\n        3. Plants of the new Helenium had smaller inflorescences than plants of the cultivar Rubinzwerg.\n        4. Ray florets of plants of the new Helenium were darker red in color than ray florets of plants of the cultivar Rubinzwerg.",
        "The accompanying photograph illustrates the overall appearance of the new Helenium. This photograph show the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photograph may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description which accurately describe the colors of the new Helenium. The photograph comprises a side perspective view of a typical flowering plant of \u2018Ruby Tuesday\u2019 grown in a container.",
        "In the following description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, 2001 Edition, except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used. The following observations and measurements describe plants grown in Hillegom, The Netherlands during the summer in an outdoor nursery and under conditions and practices which approximate those generally used in commercial Helenium production. During the production of the plants, day temperatures ranged from 14\u00b0 C. to 31\u00b0 C. and night temperatures ranged from 4\u00b0 C. to 16\u00b0 C. Measurements and numerical values represent averages for typical flowering plants.
