        "Blade-assisting mechanism 28 may include any structure configured to apply a biasing force F to urge blade 22 towards the open position and/or closed position and to allow a user to adjust the biasing force. For example, as shown in FIGS. 3-6, blade-assisting mechanism 28 may include a bias element 38, a connector element 40, and an adjustment element 42.",
        "Bias element 38 may include any structure configured to apply biasing force F to urge blade 22 towards the open position and/or closed position. For example, bias element 38 may be in the form of a coiled spring 39, as shown in FIG. 6. The bias element may include a first end 38a and a second end 38b. Additionally, bias element 38 may be configured to provide biasing force F in any suitable direction. For example, bias element 38 in FIGS. 3-4 provides a biasing force F1 in a \u201cpulling direction\u201d from pivot end 24a of handle 24 toward the opposing end 24b. Alternatively, bias element 38 may be configured to provide a biasing force F2 in a \u201cpushing direction\u201d from opposing end 24b toward pivot end 24a, as further discussed below and in FIGS. 8-10. Moreover, other suitable directions may be used for biasing force F.",

        "Connector element 40 may include any structure operatively connecting bias element 38 and blade 22. For example and particularly when bias element 38 provides biasing force F1, the connector element may include a laterally flexible cable or cord 44, as shown in FIG. 7. The flexible cable may be made of any suitable resilient material. Optionally and particularly when bias element 38 provides biasing force F2, connector element 40 may include a push rod made of any suitable rigid material, as further discussed below. Optionally, biasing force F may be provided only by a resilient cable or other structure, without the use of separate bias element 38.",
        "Flexible cable 44 may include a first end portion 44a and a second end portion 44b. First end portion 44a may have any suitable shape or structure configured to operatively connect that portion to second end 38b of bias element 38, such as eyelet 46. Second end portion 44b may have any suitable shape or structure configured to operatively connect that portion to blade 22, such as hook 48. Hook 48 may engage a hole 22b in tang 22a of blade 22 via arcuate groove 37, as shown in FIG. 5.",
