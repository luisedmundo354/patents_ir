        "The present discovery constitutes a new and distinct variety of Clematis which was discovered in a cultivated area. The mutation resulted from a naturally occurring branch mutation of unknown causation on a Clematis plant growing in a cultivated area. The resulting mutation was evaluated and asexually propagated in a controlled environment. The new variety is named \u2018Fairy Blue\u2019.",
        "The clematis plant of the present discovery has a unique characteristic which distinguishes it from the original clematis, \u2018H.F. Young\u2019. \u2018Fairy Blue\u2019 has an abundance of sterile petaloid stamens at the flower center.",
        "\u2018Fairy Blue\u2019 is a sport of the clematis variety \u2018H.F. Young\u2019, non-patented, selected by Hiroshi Hayakawa at the Anjo Clematis Garden in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, May 1994.",
        "Asexual reproduction of \u2018Fairy Blue\u2019 by cuttings was first done by Raymond J. Evison in Domarie Vineries Les Sauvagees, St. Sampsons, Guernsey, Channel Islands, United Kingdom in 1994. This initial and subsequent propagations have demonstrated that the characteristics of \u2018Fairy Blue\u2019 are true to type and are transmitted from one generation to the next.",
        "The accompanying color illustration shows as true as is reasonably possible to obtain in color photographs of this type, the typical characteristics of the buds, flowers and leaves of the new variety, with different flowers shown in various stages of maturity. The flower form, flower colors, flower buds, floral parts, flower pedicels and the cultivar's foliage are depicted.",
        "The following is a detailed description of \u2018Fairy Blue\u2019, as observed in its growth throughout the flowering period in glasshouses at Domarie Vineries Les Sauvagees, St. Sampsons, Guernsey, Channel Islands, United Kingdom. Observed plants are 24 months of age, grown in 5 gallon pots. Certain phenotypical characteristics of the variety may vary under different environmental, cultural, agronomic, seasonal, and climatic conditions. Color references are made using The Royal Horticultural Society (London, England) Colour Chart, 1995, except where common terms of color are used. For a comparison, the nearest existing Clematis variety is Multi Blue. Chart 1 details the physical characteristics of \u2018Fairy Blue\u2019 and the comparison variety.",
