        "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, irreversible memory loss, disorientation, and language impairment. Postmortem examination of AD brain sections reveals abundant senile plaques (SPs) composed of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides and numerous neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by filaments of highly phosphorylated tau proteins (for recent reviews and additional citations see Ginsberg, S. D., et al., \u201cMolecular Pathology of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders,\u201d in Cerebral Cortex: Neurodegenerative and Age-related Changes in Structure and Function of Cerebral Cortex, Kluwer Academic/Plenum, NY (1999), pp. 603-654; Vogelsberg-Ragaglia, V., et al., \u201cCell Biology of Tau and Cytoskeletal Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease,\u201d Alzheimer's Disease, Lippincot, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa. (1999), pp. 359-372). Familial AD (FAD) is caused by multiple mutations in the A precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2) genes (Ginsberg, S. D., et al., \u201cMolecular Pathology of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders,\u201d in Cerebral Cortex: Neurodegenerative and Age-related Changes in Structure and Function of Cerebral Cortex, Kluwer Academic/Plenum, NY (1999), pp. 603-654; Vogelsberg-Ragaglia, V., et al., \u201cCell Biology of Tau and Cytoskeletal Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease,\u201d Alzheimer's Disease, Lippincot, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa. (1999), pp. 359-372).",
        "While the exact mechanisms underlying AD are not fully understood, all pathogenic FAD mutations studied thus far increase production of the more amyloidogenic 42-43 amino-acid long form of the A\u03b2 peptide. Thus, at least in FAD, dysregulation of A\u03b2 production appears to be sufficient to induce a cascade of events leading to neurodegeneration. Indeed, the amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that formation of extracellular fibrillar A\u03b2 aggregates in the brain may be a pivotal event in AD pathogenesis (Selkoe, D. J., \u201cBiology of B-amyloid Precursor Protein and the Mechanism of Alzheimer's Disease,\u201d Alzheimer's Disease, Lippincot Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa. (1999), pp. 293-310; Selkoe, D. J., J. Am. Med. Assoc. 283:1615-1617 (2000); Naslund, J., et al., J. Am. Med. Assoc. 283:1571-1577 (2000); Golde, T. E., et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1502:172-187 (2000)).",
        "Various approaches in trying to inhibit the production and reduce the accumulation of fibrillar A\u03b2 in the brain are currently being evaluated as potential therapies for AD (Skovronsky, D. M. and Lee, V. M., Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 21:161-163 (2000); Vassar, R., et al., Science 286:735-741 (1999); Wolfe, M. S., et al., J. Med. Chem. 41:6-9 (1998); Moore, C. L., et al., J. Med. Chem. 43:3434-3442 (2000); Findeis, M. A., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1502:76-84 (2000); Kuner, P., Bohrmann, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 275:1673-1678 (2000)). It is therefore of great interest to develop ligands that specifically bind fibrillar A\u03b2 aggregates. Since extracellular SPs are accessible targets, these new ligands could be used as in vivo diagnostic tools and as probes to visualize the progressive deposition of A\u03b2 in studies of AD amyloidogenesis in living patients.",
        "To this end, several interesting approaches for developing fibrillar A\u03b2 aggregate-specific ligands have been reported (Ashburn, T. T., et al., Chem. Biol. 3:351-358 (1996); Han, G., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118:4506-4507 (1996); Klunk, W. E., et al., Biol. Psychiatry 35:627 (1994); Klunk, W. E., et al., Neurobiol. Aging 16:541-548 (1995); Klunk, W. E., et al., Society for Neuroscience Abstract 23:1638 (1997); Mathis, C. A., et al., Proc. XIIth Intl. Symp. Radiopharm. Chem., Uppsala, Sweden: 94-95 (1997); Lorenzo, A. and Yankner, B. A., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91:12243-12247 (1994); Zhen, W., et al., J. Med. Chem. 42:2805-2815 (1999)). The most attractive approach is based on highly conjugated chrysamine-G (CG) and Congo red (CR), and the latter has been used for fluorescent staining of SPs and NFTs in postmortem AD brain sections (Ashburn, T. T., et al., Chem. Biol. 3:351-358 (1996); Klunk, W. E., et al., J. Histochem. Cytochem. 37:1273-1281 (1989)). The inhibition constants (Ki) for binding to fibrillar A\u03b2 aggregates of CR, CG, and 3\u2032-bromo- and 3\u2032-iodo derivatives of CG are 2,800, 370, 300 and 250 nM, respectively (Mathis, C. A., et al., Proc. XIIth Intl. Symp. Radiopharm. Chem., Uppsala, Sweden: 94-95 (1997)). These compounds have been shown to bind selectively to A\u03b2 (1-40) peptide aggregates in vitro as well as to fibrillar A\u03b2 deposits in AD brain sections (Mathis, C. A., et al., Proc. XIIth Intl. Symp. Radiopharm. Chem., Uppsala, Sweden: 94-95 (1997)).",
        "Amyloidosis is a condition characterized by the accumulation of various insoluble, fibrillar proteins in the tissues of a patient. An amyloid deposit is formed by the aggregation of amyloid proteins, followed by the further combination of aggregates and/or amyloid proteins. Formation and accumulation of aggregates of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides in the brain are critical factors in the development and progression of AD. The fibrillar aggregates of amyloid peptides, A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42, are major metabolic peptides derived from amyloid precursor protein found in senile plaques and cerebrovascular amyloid deposits in AD patients (Xia, W., et al., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 97:9299-9304 (2000)). Prevention and reversal of A\u03b2 plaque formation are being targeted as a treatment for this disease (Selkoe, D., J. JAMA 283:1615-1617 (2000); Wolfe, M. S., et al., J. Med. Chem. 41:6-9 (1998); Skovronsky, D. M., and Lee, V. M., Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 21:161-163 (2000)).",
        "In addition to the role of amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease, the presence of amyloid deposits has been shown in diseases such as Mediterranean fever, Muckle-Wells syndrome, idiopathetic myeloma, amyloid polyneuropathy, amyloid cardiomyopathy, systemic senile amyloidosis, amyloid polyneuropathy, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, Down's syndrome, Scrapie, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, Kuru, Gerstamnn-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, Isolated atrial amyloid, \u03b22-microglobulin amyloid in dialysis patients, inclusion body myositis, \u03b22-amyloid deposits in muscle wasting disease, and Islets of Langerhans diabetes Type II insulinoma.",
        "Thus, a simple, noninvasive method for detecting and quantitating amyloid deposits in a patient has been eagerly sought. Presently, detection of amyloid deposits involves histological analysis of biopsy or autopsy materials. Both methods have drawbacks. For example, an autopsy can only be used for a postmortem diagnosis.",
        "Imaging agents may be based on two types of isotopes. 99mTc (T1/2, 6 h; 140 KeV) and 123I (T1/2, 13 h; 159 KeV) are routinely used for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), while 11C (T1/2, 20 min; 511 KeV) and 18F (T1/2, 110 min; 511 KeV) are commonly used for positron emission tomography (PET).",
        "The direct imaging of amyloid deposits in vivo is difficult, as the deposits have many of the same physical properties (e.g., density and water content) as normal tissues. Attempts to image amyloid deposits using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer-assisted tomography (CAT) have been disappointing and have detected amyloid deposits only under certain favorable conditions. In addition, efforts to label amyloid deposits with antibodies, serum amyloid P protein, or other probe molecules have provided some selectivity on the periphery of tissues, but have provided for poor imaging of tissue interiors.",
        "Potential ligands for detecting A\u03b2 aggregates in the living brain must cross the intact blood-brain barrier. Thus brain uptake can be improved by using ligands with relatively smaller molecular size (compared to Congo Red) and increased lipophilicity. Highly conjugated thioflavins (S and T) are commonly used as dyes for staining the A\u03b2 aggregates in the AD brain (Elhaddaoui, A., et al., Biospectroscopy 1: 351-356 (1995)). These compounds are based on benzothiazole, which is relatively small in molecular size.",
        "It would be useful to have a noninvasive technique for imaging and quantitating amyloid deposits in a patient. In addition, it would be useful to have compounds that inhibit the aggregation of amyloid proteins to form amyloid deposits and a method for determining a compound's ability to inhibit amyloid protein aggregation.",
        "The present invention provides novel compounds of Formula I, II, III IV or V.",
        "The present invention also provides diagnostic compositions comprising a radiolabeled compound of Formula I, II, III, IV or V and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.",

The labeling procedure normally relies on a Tc-99 m ligand exchange reaction between Tc-99 m (Sn)-glucoheptonate and the N2S2 ligand. Preparation of stannous (II) chloride and preserving it in a consistent stannous (II) form is critically important for the success of the labeling reaction. To stabilize the air-sensitive stannous ion it is a common practice in nuclear medicine to use a lyophilized kit, in which the stannous ion is in a lyophilized powder form mixed with an excess amount of glucoheptonate under an inert gas like nitrogen or argon. The preparation of the lyophilized stannous chloride/sodium glucoheptonate kits ensures that the labeling reaction is reproducible and predictable. The N2S2 ligands are usually air-sensitive (thiols are easily oxidized by air) and there are subsequent reactions which lead to decomposition of the ligands. The most convenient and predictable method to preserve the ligands is to produce lyophilized kits containing 100-500 \u03bcg of the ligands under argon or nitrogen.",

The solution was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 36-42 h with gentle and constant shaking. Binding studies were carried out in 12\u00d775 mm borosilicate glass tubes according to the procedure described1. Aggregated fibrils (10-50 nM in the final assay mixture) were added to the mixture containing 50 \u03bcl of radioligands (0.01-0.5 nM in 40% EtOH) and 10% EtOH in a final volume of 1 mL for saturation studies.

The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 3 h and the bound and the free radioactivities were separated by vacuum filtration through Whatman GF/B filters using a Brandel M-24R cell harvester followed by 2\u00d73 mL washes of 10% ethanol at room temperature. Filters containing the bound I-125 ligand were counted in a gamma counter (Packard 5000) with 70% counting efficiency. Under the assay conditions, the percent of the specifically bound fraction was less than 20% of the total radioactivity. The results of saturation and inhibition experiments were subjected to nonlinear regression analysis using software EBDA2 by which Kd and Ki values were calculated. Values for (Ki, nM) are the mean\u00b1SEM of three independent experiments, each in duplicate. Additional Ki values for compounds of Formula I are provided in FIGS. 1 and 2.",
        "In in vitro binding assays using pre-formed A\u03b2 aggregates of synthetic peptides and [125I]TZDM as the ligand, these novel stilbenes showed exceedingly high binding affinity (2-40 nM) to the TZ sites, while the affinity towards SB sites was very low (>1,000 nM). It is evident that the stilbenes containing an electron donating groups, such as dimethylamino-, \u2014OH or \u2014OMe group, showed excellent binding affinity to A\u03b2 aggregates. Benzothiazole ring appears to be unnecessary for binding at the TZ binding sites of A\u03b2 aggregates. This information is of paramount importance because it reduces the molecular size (molecular weight of TZDM and 1 was 380 and 349, respectively) required for binding to the TZ sites; as such it significantly enhances the flexibility on designing new ligands. The idoinated stilbenes, such as 2 and 5, respresent a structural simplicity, which suggests minimum requirements for binding the A\u03b2 aggregates may be three: 1) two benzene rings separated by a vinyl group. 2) one of the aromatic ring contains a electronic negative group, dimethylamino-, \u2014OH or \u2014OMe group. 3) there appears to be a bulk tolerance for substitution on the second aromatic ring. To characterize the compounds further, radioactive iodinated ligand, [125I]2, was prepared by converting the corresponding tributyltin derivative in the presence of Na[125I]I and hydrogen peroxide, by which the no-carrier added product was obtained in excellent yield (radiochemical purity>95%). The direct binding assay showed that the new evaluation of postmortem AD brain sections with [125I]2 suggested that the novel ligand, as expected, labeled A\u03b2 plaques.",

The mice were sacrificed by cardiac excision at various time points post injection. The organs of interest were removed and weighed, and the radioactivity was counted with an automatic gamma counter (Packard 5000). The percentage dose per organ was calculated by a comparison of the tissue counts to suitably diluted aliquots of the injected material. Total activities of blood and muscle were calculated under the assumption that they were 7% and 40% of the total body weight, respectively.",
        "In vivo biodistribution study of [125I]2 in normal mice after an iv injection suggested good brain penetration.
