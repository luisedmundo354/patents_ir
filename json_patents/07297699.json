        "The present invention relates to a new group of piperazine and piperidine derivatives having interesting pharmacological properties due to a combination of (partial) agonism towards the members of the dopamine D2-receptor subfamily and affinity for relevant serotonin and/or noradrenergic receptors.",
        "It is known from EP 0189612 that piperazine derivatives substituted at one nitrogen with a phenyl-heterocyclic group, and unsubstituted at the other nitrogen atom, have psychotropic activity.",

        "Preferred compounds according to the invention are compounds of the formula (I) wherein Y, R1 and R2 are hydrogen, X represents oxygen, and \u2014Z and Q have the above meanings, and the salts thereof.",
        "Especially preferred are the compounds wherein Y, R1 and R2 are hydrogen, X is oxygen, \u2014Z represents \u2014N and Q is optionally substituted benzyl.",
        "Compounds according to the invention show affinities for at least two members of the dopamine D2 receptor subfamily (pKi range 6.0-9.5) and a relevant serotonin (5-HT1A, 5HT5A, 5HT7) receptor (pKi range 5.0-8.0) and/or noradrenergic (\u22001, \u22002) receptors, measured according to well-defined methods (e.g.: Creese I, Schneider R and Snyder SH, [3H]-Spiroperidol labels dopamine receptors in rat pituitary and brain, Eur J Pharmacol 1997, 46: 377-381 and Gozlan H, El Mestikawy S, Pichat L, Glowinsky J and Hamon M, 1983, Identification of presynaptic serotonin autoreceptors using a new ligand 3H-PAT, Nature 1983, 305: 140-142).",
        "The compounds show varying activities as (partial) agonists towards members of the dopamine D2 receptor subfamily and surprisingly towards the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor and/or noradrenergic \u03b11 receptor. This activity in general was measured on the formation of adenylate cyclase in cell-lines expressing these cloned receptors (e.g. human D2 receptors and 5-HT1A receptors expressed in CHO cell line according to the methods described by Solomon Y, Landos C, Rodbell M, 1974, A highly selective adenylyl cyclase assay, Anal Biochem 1974, 58: 541-548 and Weiss S, Sebben M and Bockaert JJ, 1985, Corticotropin-peptide regulation of intracellular cyclic AMP production in cortical neurons in primary culture, J Neurochem 1985, 45:869-874).",
        "The unique combination of (partial) dopamine D2-receptor subfamily agonism and affinity towards relevant serotonin- and/or noradrenergic- receptors results in a surprisingly broad activity in several animal models, predictive for psychiatric and/or neurologic disturbances.",

The activity of the compounds in this model was in the low microgram/kg range, which is surprisingly more active (by a factor 100 to 3000) compared to the compounds previously described in EP 0190472 and EP 0398413.",
        "In addition these compounds also show effects in models predictive for antidepressant activity at higher doses (forced swim test, see e.g.: Porsolt RD, Anton G, Blavet N and Jalfre M, 1978, Behavioural despair in rats: A new model sensitive to antidepressant treatments, Eur J Pharmacol 1978, 47:379-391 and the differential reinforcement of low rates of responding model in rats, see e.g.: McGuire PS and Seiden LS, The effects of tricyclic antidepressants on performance under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate schedule in rats, J Pharmacol Exp Ther 1980, 214: 635-641).",
        "Depending on the degree of partial agonism towards the dopamine D2-receptor subfamily, compounds tend to behave like full dopamine receptor agonists in induced climbing behaviour in mice, or, in the presence of a full dopamine receptor agonist, behave like a dopamine antagonist in the, e.g. apomorphine-induced climbing behaviour in mice (antagonism of apomorphine-induced climbing behaviour in mice, e.g.: Costall B, Naylor RJ and Nohria V, Differential actions of typical and atypical agents on two behavioural effects of apomorphine in the mouse, Brit J Pharmacol 1978, 63: 381-382; suppression of locomotor activity, e.g.: File SE and Hyde JRG, A test of anxiety that distinguishes between the actions of benzodiazepines and those of other minor tranquillisers or stimulants, Pharmacol Biochem Behav 1979, 11: 65-79). Compounds of the invention show potent efficacy in animal models predictive of anti-Parkinsonian activity. These include 6-OH-DA induced turning behavior in rats (Ungerstedt U, 6-OH-DA induced degeneration of central monoamine neurons, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1968 5: 107-110), MPTP-lesioned Marmoset monkey (Nomoto M, Jenner P, Marsden CD: The dopamine agonist D2 agonist LY 141865 but not the D1 agonist SKF 38393, reverses Parkinsonism induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in the common Marmoset. Neurosci. Lett., (1985) 57: 37-41). Surprisingly, compounds of the invention lack the unwanted side effects associated with currently used dopaminergic drugs, including induction of stereotypy, nausea, dizziness and vomiting.",
        "The compounds are of value in the treatment of affections or diseases of the central nervous system, caused by disturbances of the dopaminergic and/or serotonergic and/or noradrenergic systems, for example: addiction (including craving), anxiety disorders (including e.g. generalised anxiety, panic, obsessive compulsive disorder), depression, autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, disturbances of cognition and memory.",
        "Suitable acids with which the compounds of the invention can form acceptable acid addition salts are for example hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, and organic acids such as citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, p-toluene sulphonic acid, methane sulphonic acid and naphtalene suiphonic acid.",
        "Prodrugs are derivatives of the compounds having formula (I) wherein a group is present which is easily removed after administration. Suitable prodrugs for example are compounds containing one of the following groups: amidine, enamine, a Mannich base, a hydroxy-methylene derivative, an O-(acyloxymethylene carbamate) derivative, carbamate or enaminone.",

        "a) To 1 mmol of halide Q-Hal, 0.8 mmol of I-H (\u2014Z \u2550\u2014N) dissolved in 7.5 ml of CH3CN was added. Subsequently 0.43 ml (2.5 mmol) of (i-Pr)2NEt was added and the resulting mixture was stirred for 3 hrs at 85\u00b0 C. After the reaction mixture had reached roomtemperature, 7.5 ml of dichloromethane were added, the resulting solution was put on top of a solid phase extraction column (Varian 5 g type Si) and the fraction containing the desired product was subsequently put on top of a solid phase extraction column (Varian 5 g 0.8 meq./g type Strong Cationic Exchange (SCX), conditioned on MeOH, then CH2Cl2)) after which the column was washed 2 times with MeOH. Then, the latter column, was washed with 0.1 M NH3/MeOH and elution was performed with 1.0 M NH3/MeOH. The eluate was concentrated in vacuo removing solvent and the rest of (i-Pr)2NEt, yielding the expected product.",
        "It is also possible to perform the purification with standard chromatographic procedures. In a single case (i.e. A1), the solvent used was dimethylformamide (DMF), see below.",
        "b) 10.2 g (40 mmol) of I-H.HCI were suspended in 150 ml of DMF, to the stirred resulting mixture 21 ml (120 mmol) of (i-Pr)2NEt were added. During a period of 10 minutes a solution of 7.0 g (41 mmol) of benzylbromide in 25 ml of DMF was added at room temperature, the process is slightly exothermic (5-10\u00b0 C.). Stirring was continued 3 hrs at room temperature after which the reaction mixture was poured on to 700 ml of water. Subsequently extraction was performed with 3\u00d7250 ml of ethylacetate, the combined organic fractions washed with 2\u00d7150 ml of water and dried with MgSO4. Removal of the drying agent by filtration and of the solvent in vacuo yielded 10.5 g of raw product. The latter was purified by flash column chromatography (SiO2, eluent CH2Cl2/MeOH 98/2), yielding 8.5 g (69%) of pure product A1 as a free base, m.p.: 189-190\u00b0 C.",

(dry ice, acetone). While stirring, a solution of tert.butyl-lithium in heptane (ca. 156 mmol, 2 molequivalents) was added slowly after which the reaction mixture was stirred for 0.5 hrs at \u221270\u00b0 C., and subsequently for an additional 2 hrs at \u221225\u00b0 C. Again the reaction mixture was brought to \u221275\u00b0 C. and a solution of 14.4 ml N-benzylpiperidone (78 mmol, 1 molequivalent) in 25 ml of dry THF. The reaction mixture was allowed to reach room temperature and stirred for an additional 16 hrs. Subsequently, 250 ml of 2M HCl was carefully added, the resulting mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3\u00d7). The water layer was, while stirring, poured on to 84 g of NaHCO3 after which the waterlayer was again extracted with EtOAc. The resulting organic layer was dried on Na2SO4. After removal of the drying agent by filtration and of the solvent by evaporation in vacuo, 15 g of a dark yellow oil was isolated. Column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: CH2Cl2/MeOH 9/1) yielded 7.5 g (ca. 30%) of a light yellow foam. While stirring, 1 g of the foam was triturated with di-ethyl ether and a small volume of EtOAc. After 50 hrs the solid material was filtered and washed with with di-ethyl ether/hexane to yield 0.5 g of a nearly white solid xl, mp 125-8\u00b0 C.",

The layers were separated and the waterlayer was extracted with EtOAc (2x). The combined organic fractions (3), were dried on Na2SO4. After removal of the drying agent by filtration and of the solvent by concentration in vacuo, 8 g of a dark yellow oil was isolated which solidified on standing. Column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: EtOAc) yielded 4.56 g (ca. 30%) of a nearly white product. The latter was suspended in hexane and stirred for 20 hrs.
