The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising said cationic amphiphiles, useful for the delivery of biologically active therapeutic molecules into body cells/tissues of mammals and humans.",
        "Although many defective genes associated with numerous genetic diseases have been identified and characterized, because of the selective permeability of biological cell membranes, delivering required amounts of therapeutically important genes into the target body cells is often a daunting challenge.",
        "Thus, success of gene therapy approach in treating genetic diseases depends, in a major way, on the development of efficient and safe gene delivery reagents that will facilitate the intracellular delivery of therapeutic genes into the particular body cells of a patient. Accordingly, development of safe and efficient gene delivery reagents and methods that can facilitate entry of functional genes into body cells are of great medical importance. Amphiphilic molecules containing both polar and non-polar regions in their molecular architecture have been used in delivering therapeutically important molecules into cells. This makes sense given the existence of both polar and non-polar segments in biological cell membranes. Cationic amphiphiles are the particularly important class of amphiphilic compounds used most extensively for enhancing intracellular delivery of many biologically active therapeutic compounds. Broadly speaking, at physiological pH the polar segment of cationic amphiphile interacts with the therapeutically important molecules including polyanionic macromolecular DNA, RNA, proteins etc. while the non-polar region of the cationic amphiphiles facilitate the passage of the therapeutic compounds through the non-polar part of the cell membranes.",

        "Step (c). Reacting the purified ditosylate (0.5 g, 1.2 mmol) with 4 equivalent of secondary amine (2.4 g, 4.7 mmol) in 40 ml triethyl amine at 80\u00b0 C. for 72 hours. Silica gel column chromatographic purification was performed using 60-120 mesh size silica and 10-15% methanol in chloroform as the eluent. Crude title amphiphile No.4 was obtained by subjecting the quaternized salt to repeated (3 times) chloride ion-exchange column chromatography, each time using a freshly generated Amberlyst A-26 chloride ion exchange column and about 75 ml of methanol as the eluent. Finally, pure quaternized title amphiphile salt 5 (0.05 g, 7.1% yield) was obtained by crystallizing the crude product using 10 ml 3:7 (v/v) chloroform:pet-ether. All the isolated intermediates gave spectroscopic data in agreement with their assigned structures.",
        "1H-NMR of amphiphile 5 (200 MHz, CDCl3): \u03b4/ppm=0.90 [6H, t,\u00d72-CH3]; 1.20-1.45 [56H, m, 28\u00d7-CH2]; 1.90-2.00 [4H, m, 2\u00d7-CH\u2550CH\u2014CH2]; 3.40-3.75 [8H, m, 4\u00d7-N\u2014CH2]; 4.05-4.20 [2H, m, \u2014CH\u2014OH]; 4.75-4.80 [1H, m, \u2014CH\u2014OH]; 5.20-5.40 [1H, m, \u2014CH\u2014OH].",
        "Cell Transfection. COS-1 cells were seeded at a density of 15,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate eighteen hours before the transfection. 0.15 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA was complexed with varying amount of lipid (0.05-4.3 nmoles) in 13 \u03bcl of plain DMEM medium for 30 min. The charge ratios were varied from 0.1:1 to 9:1 (+/\u2212) over this range of the lipid. The complex was diluted to 100 \u03bcl with plain DMEM and added to the wells. After 3 h of incubation, 100 \u03bcl of DMEM with 10% FCS was added to the cells. The medium was changed to 10% complete medium after 24 h and the reporter gene activity was estimated after 48 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 50 \u03bcl of lysis buffer (0.25 M Tris.HCl, pH 8.0 and 0.5% NP40). Care was taken to ensure complete lysis. The \u03b2-galactosidase activity per well was estimated by adding 50 \u03bcl of 2\u00d7 substrate solution (1.33 mg/ml of ONPG, 0.2 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.15 and 2 mM magnesium chloride) to the lysate in a 96-well plate. Absorption at 405 nm was converted to \u03b2-galactosidase units by using calibration curve constructed with pure commercial \u03b2-galactosidase enzyme. The values of \u03b2-galactosidase units in replicate plates assayed on the same day varied by less than 30%. The transfection efficiency values reported were average values from four replicate transfection plates assayed on the same day. Each transfection experiment was repeated three times on three different days and the day-to-day variation in average transfection efficiency values for identically treated replicate transfection plates was 2-3 fold and was dependent on the cell density and conditions of the cells. FIG. 1 shows representative transfection results obtained with cationic lipids 1-5. As shown in FIG. 1, the in vitro transfection efficiency of cationic lipid 2 is comparable to or better than that of DMRIE, one of the most extensively used commercially available cationic transfection lipids used in in vitro gene delivery.",
        "Lipid:DNA Interactions Assay. Intercalation-induced fluorescence increase and competition with cationic lipids to bind to DNA has made Ethidium Bromide (EtBr) an excellent tool to study cationic lipid-DNA interactions. To assess the representative lipid:DNA interactions for the cationic lipids of the present invention, we have titrated the EtBr:pCMV \u03b2-gal complex with increasing amounts of cationic lipids 1-5.",
        "The extent of Et.Br binding to the DNA was monitored by the changes in the fluorescence. EtBr fluorescence was monitored in Hitachi 4500 fluorimeter by setting the excitation wavelength at 518 nm and emission wavelength at 585 nm. To one ml of TE buffer (pH 8.0), 0.78 nmoles of DNA and 2.5 nmoles of EtBr were added. The change in fluorescence was monitored after adding small volumes of lipids 1-5 to the EtBr:DNA complex. Arbitrary fluorescence values were recorded after allowing sufficient time for equilibration. The order of addition of EtBr or lipid to DNA did not alter the final values indicating that the equilibrium does not depend on the order of addition and reaches in minutes. Percent fluorescence was calculated considering the fluorescence value in the absence of lipid as 100.",
        "The data in FIG. 2 shows that lipids 1, 4 and 5 interact poorly with DNA as seen by their relatively poor ability to exclude ethidium bromide from DNA. Lipids 2 and 3 interact with DNA equally well up to lipid:DNA ratio of 1.25 or so (FIG. 2). The decrease in EtBr fluorescence at charge ratios of 3:1 was greater than 80% with all the lipids 1-5. Taken together the transfection results shown in FIG. 1 and the lipid:DNA interaction profiles shown in FIG. 2, it seems that strong lipid:DNA interactions for the presently described cationic lipids results into better intracellular gene delivery.",
        "Toxicity Assays. An MTT based viability assay was performed to assess the cytotoxicity of lipids 1-5 at various lipid:DNA charge ratios with COS-1 cells as described previously (Banerjee, R. et al. 1999). Except lipid 1, all the other lipids (2-5) showed least cytotoxicity even at a 9:1 lipid:DNA charge ratio (FIG. 3). For lipids 1, 4 and 5 at a 3:1 charge ratio the toxicity varied from 15-25% of the treated cells. The toxicity of lipid 2 (with shorter alkyl chains) may originate from its probable detergent-like cell-lysing activity. As shown in FIG. 3, the cellular toxicity profiles of lipids 2-5 of the present invention are better than those of several commercially available cationic transfection lipids including lipofectin, lipofectAmine and DMRIE.",
        "Advantages",
        "1. The novel cationic lipids of the present invention are particularly useful to combat genetic diseases by non-viral gene therapy.\n        2. The cationic amphiphiles of the present invention do not have glycerol-backbone in their molecular structures.\n        3. The cationic amphiphiles are useful for delivering polyanions, polypeptides and nucleopolymers into cells."
