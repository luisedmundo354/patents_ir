        "The present invention relates to a transmission apparatus having a dividing unit to which a rotational power from a drive unit is transmitted, a joint unit, and a first differential planetary gear unit, and specifically to a transmission apparatus used to rotate a fluid machinery such as a turbo machinery by a drive unit such as a motor for synchronizing a drive side and a driven side with each other, relieving an impact that occurs at starting/stopping or at changing in a rotational speed, and achieving an efficient transmission of a rotational power.",
        "In a conventional apparatus shown in FIG. 22, an output shaft C4 of an electric motor A1 serving as a drive source is connected to an input side of a driven unit A2 such as a fluid machinery via a joint A22 and an output shaft C7. In this case, transmission of a rotational power from the electric motor A1 is limited to a range in which the joint A22 can transmit the rotational power.",
        "At the same time, there is a need to transmit a rotational power beyond the range in which the joint A22 can transmit the rotational power.",
        "In order to meet such a need, as shown in FIGS. 23A and 23B, there has been proposed a transmission apparatus A15 which distributes or divides a rotational power that is input from a drive source A1.",
        "According to the transmission apparatus A15 shown in FIGS. 23A and 23B, the rotational power from the drive source A1 is distributed to a power line R1 and a power line R2 by a dividing unit 6, so that the rotational power below the transmission limit of a continuously variable transmission A 20 is distributed to the power line R1 and the residual rotational power is distributed to the power line R2.",
        "The rotational powers divided by the dividing unit 6 are converged by a differential planetary gear unit A30 disposed at an output side of the continuously variable transmission A20, so that the converged rotational power is transmitted to a driven unit A2 via a single output shaft 37.",
        "With this structure, the rotational power beyond the transmission limit of the continuously variable transmission A20 can be transmitted to the driven side.",
        "However, the continuously variable transmission A20 shown in FIGS. 23A and 23B employs a mechanism of a toroidal-type continuously variable transmission (CVT). Since the toroidal-type CVT is of a contact type, there are limits to a maximum transmission power and a service life. Therefore, it is difficult to apply the toroidal-type CVT to a large equipment which is required to transmit a large power, and to an industrial machinery which is required to have a reliability.",
        "Further, various kinds of vibrations and impacts, such as pulsation due to power fluctuation, shock vibration at speed change, and torsion vibration of the output shaft, are transmitted or occur to an output side of the toroidal-type CVT. Accordingly, the toroidal-type CVT, which utilizes solid friction, is problematic in output fluctuation and durability because of such vibrations and impacts.",
        "In addition, another type of conventional transmission apparatus has the same problems.",
        "The present invention has been made in view of the above drawbacks. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a transmission apparatus which can efficiently transmit a rotational power beyond a transmission limit of a joint unit, and can absorb various kinds of vibrations and impacts, such as pulsation, shock vibration at speed change, and torsion vibration of an output shaft, for thereby enabling an increase in service life and power transmission limit.",
        "A transmission apparatus according to the present invention comprises: at least one of a dividing unit (6) and a differential planetary gear unit (30); and a joint unit (20); wherein a rotational power to be transmitted via the joint unit (20) is smaller than a rotational power (i.e., a rotational power of a drive unit) which has been input to the transmission apparatus, and the joint unit (20) comprises a fluid coupling.",
        "In the transmission apparatus according to the present invention, the rotational power which has been input to the transmission apparatus is transmitted to the dividing unit (6) via a single input shaft and is output to two rotating shafts, one of the two rotating shafts is connected to one of two input shafts of the differential planetary gear unit (30), and the other of the two rotating shafts is connected to the other of the two input shafts of the differential planetary gear unit (30) via the fluid coupling (20).",
        "FIGS. 24A through 24D schematically illustrate the manner in which a power is transmitted from a drive unit A1 to a driven unit A2. For, example, in FIG. 24A, a power P from the drive unit A1 is divided by a dividing unit (distribution gears) 6. A power P1, which is one of the divided powers, is transmitted to a differential planetary gear unit A30 via a power line R1. A power P2, which is the other of the divided powers, is transmitted to the differential planetary gear unit A30 via a continuously variable transmission A20 and a power line R2. The power P1 and the power P2 are joined together again in the differential planetary gear unit A30 and then transmitted to the driven unit A2.",
        "FIGS. 24A and 24B illustrate the manner of power distribution, and FIGS. 24C and 24D illustrate the manner of power circulation. In FIGS. 24A through 24D, magnitude of the power flow due to action of the differential planetary gear unit A30 is expressed by a width of a white arrow. The power distribution means the manner in which the power from the input side is divided by the distribution gears and the divided powers are transmitted through two paths and then joined together by the differential planetary gear to flow into the output side. The power transmitted through one of two distribution shafts is larger than the power transmitted through the other of the distribution shafts. On the other hand, the power circulation means the manner in which the power from the input side flows only into one of the distribution gears and flows into the output side via the differential planetary gear (hereinafter, a shaft through which the power is transmitted will be referred to as a shaft A). Specifically, as shown in FIGS. 24C and 24D, there exists a power flow circulating in the order of the differential planetary gear\u2192the distribution gears\u2192the continuously variable transmission\u2192the differential planetary gear. In this case, the powers flowing through the shaft A are joined together and the joined power becomes larger than the input power. The power flowing through the other shaft becomes small and its flow direction is reversed.",
        "FIGS. 24B and 24C schematically illustrate the power transmission manner of the present invention. The magnitude of the power flow of the power line R2 passing through the continuously variable transmission A20 is smaller than the input power.",
        "Specifically, \u201cthe rotational power to be transmitted via the joint unit (20) is smaller than the rotational power which has been input to the transmission apparatus\u201d, which is an essential element of the present invention, means the manner in which the magnitude of the power flow of the power line R2 passing through the continuously variable transmission A20 is smaller than the input power, as shown in FIGS. 24B and 24C. The present invention uses a fluid coupling as the continuously variable transmission.",
        "It is preferable that the fluid coupling comprises a variable-speed fluid coupling. According to the transmission apparatus of the present invention having such a structure, the rotational power beyond the transmission limit of the joint unit is not input to the joint unit, and hence the rotational power can be transmitted efficiently. Further, the fluid coupling can absorb various kinds of vibrations and impacts, such as pulsation of the input rotational power, shock due to speed change, and torsion vibration of the shaft, thus enabling a smooth transmission of the power.",
        "In the transmission apparatus according to the present invention, the rotational power which has been input to the transmission apparatus is transmitted to the dividing unit (6) via a single input shaft (15a) and is output to two rotating shafts (4, 9), one (9) of the two rotating shafts (4, 9) is connected to one (13) of two input shafts (13, 5) of the differential planetary gear unit (30), and the other (4) of the two rotating shafts (4, 9) is connected to the other (5) of the two input shafts (13, 5) of the differential planetary gear unit (30) via the fluid coupling (20).",
        "With such a structure, even if the power, which is input to the transmission apparatus, exceeds the transmission limit of the joint unit, the input power is divided into two by the dividing unit, so that one of the divided powers, which is below the transmission limit, is distributed to the fluid coupling and the other is directly distributed to the differential planetary gear unit. Accordingly, the transmission apparatus can transmit the power that is beyond the transmission limit of the fluid coupling.",
        "In the transmission apparatus according to the present invention, the rotational power which has been input to the transmission apparatus is transmitted to the differential planetary gear unit (30B) via a single input shaft (15b) (of the dividing unit) and is transmitted to two output shafts (13b, 4b) of the differential planetary gear unit (30B), one (a direct-coupling shaft 13b) of the two output shafts of the differential planetary gear unit (30B) is connected to one (9b) of two input shafts of a converging unit (6B), and the other (4b) of the two output shafts of the differential planetary gear unit (30B) is connected to the other (37b) of the two input shafts of the converging unit (6B) via the fluid coupling (20).",
        "According to the transmission apparatus of the present invention having such a structure, the input power is divided into two by the differential planetary gear unit, so that one of the divided powers, which is below the transmission limit, is distributed to the fluid coupling and the other is directly distributed to the dividing unit. Accordingly, the transmission apparatus can transmit the power that is beyond the transmission limit of the fluid coupling.",
        "It is preferable that a gear unit (52d, 53d) having a speed-increasing gear and a speed-decreasing gear is provided on at least one of an input shaft (9, 5) and an output shaft (37d) of the differential planetary gear unit.",
        "With such a structure, while keeping a rotational speed or a torque that is input to the transmission apparatus constant, the rotational speed or the torque that is output to the driven unit can be freely adjusted to an efficient value.",
        "A transmission apparatus according to the present invention comprises: a dividing unit to which a rotational power from a drive unit is transmitted; a joint unit; and a first differential planetary gear unit; wherein one rotational power to be transmitted via the joint unit is smaller than the other rotational power, and the joint unit comprises an electric motor and a second differential planetary gear unit.",
        "A transmission apparatus according to the present invention comprises: at least one of a dividing unit and a first differential planetary gear unit; and a joint unit; wherein a rotational power from a drive unit is divided into at least two rotational powers by the dividing unit or the first differential planetary gear unit, one of the rotational powers is input to the joint unit, the rotational power to be input to the joint unit is smaller than the other of the rotational powers, and the joint unit comprises an electric motor and a second differential planetary gear unit.",
        "In the transmission apparatus according to the present invention, the rotational power from the drive unit is transmitted to the dividing unit via a single input shaft of the dividing unit and is output from the dividing unit to two rotating shafts, one of the two rotating shafts is connected to one of two input shafts of the first differential planetary gear unit, and the other of the two rotating shafts is connected to the other of the two input shafts of the first differential planetary gear unit.",
        "In the transmission apparatus according to the present invention, the rotational power from the drive unit is transmitted to a single input shaft of the first differential planetary gear unit, one of two output shafts of the first differential planetary gear unit is connected to one of two input shafts of a converging unit, and the other of the two output shafts of the first differential planetary gear unit is connected to the other of the two input shafts of the converging unit via the second differential planetary gear unit.",
        "In the transmission apparatus according to the present invention, the second differential planetary gear unit has a single-pinion-type structure in which one planetary gear is arranged in a radial direction and one or more planetary gears are arranged in a circumferential direction in a region between a sun gear and a ring gear, and each of the drive unit, the electric motor, and a load is directly connected to any one of an input shaft, an output shaft, and a speed-change shaft.",
        "Accordingly, since the power from the drive unit is transmitted to the load without passing through the joint unit, a capacity of the joint unit can be small even in a case of operating a large machinery. Further, since the joint unit comprises the differential planetary gear unit having no frictional part but having a mechanically coupling structure, the long service life can be achieved and the transmission limit can become sufficiently high.",
        "In order to clarify the effect of the present invention, first, there will be illustrated a flow of the rotational power transmitted by a combination of the dividing unit 6, a speed-change device, i.e., the joint unit R, and the differential planetary gear unit G, with reference to FIGS. 18 through 21. The dividing unit 6 is connected to an input shaft I. One of power flows that are output from the dividing unit 6 is input to a shaft R2 of the differential planetary gear unit G through the joint unit R, and the other is input to another shaft R1 of the differential planetary gear unit G. The power flows are then output from an output shaft O.",
        "When the power flow, which is represented by a reference sign P, of the input shaft I is divided into P1 and P2 by the dividing unit 6, the power flow of the output shaft is P on the assumption that there is no loss. Magnitude of the power flow is expressed by a width of a white arrow.",
        "It is preferable that the power flow passing through the joint unit R is as small as possible, and hence it can be said that the manner shown in FIGS. 19 and 20 is preferable. Specifically, \u201cthe rotational power to be transmitted via the joint unit is smaller than the rotational power which has been input to the transmission apparatus\u201d, which is an essential element of the present invention, means the manner in which the magnitude of the power flow of the power line R2 passing through the joint unit R is smaller than the input power, as shown in FIGS. 19 and 20.",

        "In FIGS. 1 and 2, a transmission apparatus 15 is disposed between a motor A1 (expressed as a drive unit A1 in FIG. 1) serving as a drive source and a fluid machinery A2 (expressed as a rotary machine A2 in FIG. 1) serving as a driven unit. The transmission apparatus 15 is coupled to the motor A1 and the fluid machinery A2 via an input-side clutch 3 and an output-side clutch 39.",
        "The transmission apparatus 15 comprises a power-dividing unit 6, a fluid coupling 20 for speed change, and a differential planetary gear unit 30, each of which serves as an essential part thereof.",
        "The power-dividing unit 6 divides a rotational power of a rotating input shaft 15a connected to the input-side clutch 3 into two and distributes the divided rotational powers to a rotating shaft 4, which is directly connected to the rotating input shaft 15a, and to a rotating shaft 9 via gears 7 and 8. A power line via the rotating shaft 4 serves as a power line R1, and a power line via the rotating shaft 9 serves as a power line R2. There are two cases in the direction of the power transmission of the power line R1: One is that the power is transmitted from the rotating shaft 4 to the rotating shaft 5 via the fluid coupling 20, and the other is that the power is transmitted from the rotating shaft 5 to the rotating shaft 4 via the fluid coupling 20.",
        "In the latter case, the fluid coupling 20 comprises an operating device 22, a drive pump 26, and a driven turbine 24, and is constructed so as to transmit the power from the rotating shaft 5 to the rotating shaft 4.",
        "The differential planetary gear unit 30 comprises a sun gear 31, pinion gears 33, and a ring gear 35, as with a known structure. The sun gear 31 which is directly connected to the rotating shaft 5, and a carrier 13 which couples the rotating shaft 9 to the pinion gears 33 via a gear 12 serve as input shafts, respectively, and the ring gear 35 serves as an output shaft. The ring gear 35 is connected to the fluid machinery A2 via a rotating shaft 37 and the output-side clutch 39.",

FIG. 4 shows a structure in which the power aspect to be transmitted to the rotating shaft 5 is operated by the operating device 22 which controls a circulating flow between the pump 26, which is directly connected to the rotating shaft 4, and the turbine 24.",

The ring gear 35 serves as the output shaft. It is known that the differential planetary gear unit has six permutations of input-output patterns that are made by a combination of the sun gear 31, the carrier 13, and the ring gear 35. Specifically, the number of permutations of the elements comprising the sun gear 31, the carrier 13, and the ring gear 35, two input shafts (i.e., the direct-coupling shaft 9 (see FIG. 2) without passing through the speed-change device and the speed-change shaft 5 passing through the speed-change device), and one output shaft 37 of the differential planetary gear unit is six given by 3!.",
        "Operation of the transmission apparatus 15 having the above-mentioned structure will be described below.",

The rotating input shaft 15a transmits the rotational power to the power-dividing unit 6. The power-dividing unit 6 distributes the rotational power to the rotating shaft 4 of the power line R1 and the rotating shaft 9 of the power line R2. At this time, the distribution of the rotational power to the rotating shaft 4 is limited to such a degree that a torque is below a transmission limit defined by an absorption capability of the fluid coupling 20 while a rotational speed is \u03c9i. The rotational power distributed to the rotating shaft 9 has the rotational speed \u03c9i and a residual torque if the power-dividing unit 6a has a gear ratio of 1. It is preferable that the torque to be distributed to the fluid coupling 20 is selected such that an efficient transmission is achieved while the torque is kept below the transmission limit.",
        "The rotational power of the rotating shaft 9 is transmitted to the carrier 13 via the gear 12.

        "The rotational powers transmitted to the carrier 13 and the sun gear 31 are transmitted from the ring gear 35 to the fluid machinery A2 via the rotating shaft 37 and the output-side clutch 39. At this time, the rotational power transmitted to the fluid machinery A2 has a rotational speed \u03c9o and a torque To. Assuming that there is no power transmission loss in the transmission apparatus 15, the following relation holds: \u03c9i\u00d7Ti=\u03c9o\u00d7To.",
        "In this manner, the rotational power from the motor A1 is divided into two and distributed to the power line R1 passing through the fluid coupling 20 and the branched power line R2, and the divided rotational powers are joined together again by the differential planetary gear unit 30, so that the transmission apparatus 15 transmits the rotational power that is beyond the rotational power limit of the fluid coupling 20.",
        "FIG. 6 shows a second embodiment of the present invention. Those parts which are different from those of the first embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 will be mainly described below. Those parts which are denoted by the same reference numerals as those shown FIG. 1 have identical structure and function.",
        "In FIG. 6, a transmission apparatus 15B is disposed between a motor A1 (expressed as a drive unit A1 in FIG. 6) serving as a drive source and a fluid machinery A2 (expressed as a rotary machine A2 in FIG. 6) serving as a driven unit.

        "Specifically, when practicing the present invention, the connection arrangement of three rotating parts of the differential planetary gear unit can be selected freely. Therefore, in the case of not specifying the gear, the three rotating parts will be referred to as a first rotating element, a second rotating element, and a third rotating element.",
        "An output shaft 73 of the second gear 62 of the dividing unit 6 is connected to a gear 74, and this gear 74 meshes with a gear 75 coupled to the carrier 77 of the planetary gears 76 of a first differential planetary gear unit P1.",
        "The output shaft 72 of the second differential planetary gear unit P2 is connected to the sun gear 78 of the first differential planetary gear unit P1, and a ring gear 79 of the first differential planetary gear unit P1 is coupled to a load L such as a fluid machinery via an output shaft 80.",
        "Therefore, a rotational power of the output shaft 60 of the drive unit M is distributed to the output shaft 63 of the first gear 61 and the output shaft 73 of the second gear 62 by the dividing unit 6. The planetary gears 65 of the second differential planetary gear unit P2 are rotated by the rotation of the variable-speed motor 70, and hence the rotational speed of the ring gear 71 is changed according to the rotational speed of the planetary gears 65. In this manner, as the rotational speed of the output shaft 72 of the second differential planetary gear unit P2 is changed, the rotational speed of the sun gear 78 of the first differential planetary gear unit P1 is also changed. As a result, the rotational speed of the output shaft 80 of the first differential planetary gear unit P1 can be changed, and hence the rotational speed of the load L can be controlled.",
        "FIG. 13 shows a ninth embodiment of the present invention. An output shaft 60 of a drive unit M is connected to a first rotating element of a first differential planetary gear unit P1, and is also connected to a second rotating element, which mainly transmits a power, of the first differential planetary gear unit P1. A first output shaft 81 is a direct-coupling shaft and is connected to a second gear 82 of a converging unit 6B. A second output shaft 83, which is connected to a third rotating element of the first differential planetary gear unit P1, is a speed-change shaft and is connected to a first rotating element of the second differential planetary gear unit P2.",
        "A second rotating element of this second differential planetary gear unit P2 is connected to an output shaft 69 serving as a motor shaft of a small-capacity variable-speed motor 70. Further, a third rotating element of the second differential planetary gear unit P2 is connected to a first gear 84 meshing with the second gear 82 of the converging unit 6B. An output shaft 85 of the converging unit 6B, i.e., a shaft of the first gear 84, is connected to the load L.",
        "In this embodiment shown in FIG. 13 also, most of the rotational power of the drive unit M is transmitted from the output shaft 81, which serves as a direct-coupling shaft connected to the second rotating element of the first differential planetary gear unit P1, to the load L via the dividing unit 6. A rotational speed of the third rotating element of the first differential planetary gear unit P1 is changed according to the rotational speed of the variable-speed motor 70, i.e., the rotational speed of the second output shaft 83 serving as a speed-change shaft. As a result, the rotational speed of the first output shaft 81 is changed.",
        "FIG. 14 shows a tenth embodiment of the present invention. An example shown in FIG. 14 is a modification of the eighth embodiment shown in FIG. 12, and corresponding parts are denoted by the same reference numerals. Only different parts will be described below.",
        "In the example shown in FIG. 14, a clutch 90 is provided on an output shaft 72 of the second differential planetary gear unit P2. An output shaft 69 of the variable-speed motor 70 is connected to the second differential planetary gear unit P2 via a speed-increasing gear unit 91 having a direct-coupling switch clutch (not shown). Further, a clutch 92 is provided on an output shaft 73.",
        "In this example, the clutches 90 and 92 are disengaged, and the direct-coupling switch clutch is switched to the speed-increasing side. Then, the variable-speed motor 70 starts the drive unit such as a squirrel-cage induction motor. When the drive unit M is increased to a predetermined rotational speed, the drive unit M is energized. According to such an operation manner, electric power for the starting can be small.",
        "In the eight through tenth embodiments also, the rotational powers transmitted via the direct-coupling shafts (output shafts) 73 and 81 are larger than the rotational powers transmitted via the speed-change shafts 72 and 83, respectively. Accordingly, even if the second differential planetary gear unit P2 and the variable-speed motor 70 each constituting the joint unit have a small capacity, it is possible to appropriately change the rotational speed of the load L having a large capacity.",
        "However, when practicing the present invention, if a negative rotational power is transmitted to the speed-change shafts 72 and 83, i.e., if feedback occurs, the rotational power to be transmitted to the direct-coupling shafts 73 and 81 becomes large by the same amount. Therefore, it is important in designing the transmission apparatus to prevent the feedback from occurring at any rotational speed.",
        "FIGS. 15 and 16 show an eleventh embodiment which is a modification of the eighth embodiment. As with the FIG. 14, those parts corresponding to those in FIG. 12 are denoted by the same reference numerals, and only different parts will be described below.",
        "In an example shown in FIGS. 15 and 16, a clutch 90 is provided on the output shaft 72 of the second differential planetary gear unit P2, i.e., a speed-change shaft. The variable-speed motor 70 is controlled by an inverter controller 100. When the load L is decelerated, the variable-speed motor 70 is utilized as a generator and supplies current to a work W, whereby the variable-speed motor 70 is utilized as a brake, as described later. As with the example shown in FIG. 14, a clutch 92 is provided on the direct-coupling shaft 73. A reference sign S in the drawing represents a rotation sensor of the load L.",
        "When the variable-speed motor 70 is utilized as a brake, the work W can be applied to a variety of actions such as heat generation due to resistance, storing electricity to a storage battery, and selling electricity to a commercial power source through a frequency inverter.",
        "Operation will be described with reference to FIG. 16. A controller unit (not shown) receives a signal from the rotation sensor S and then sends a switching signal to the inverter controller 100 for the work W.",
        "First, the control unit reads the signal from the rotational sensor S (step S1), and decides whether or not the load L is decelerated (step S2). In the case of NO in step S2, then the variable-speed motor 70 is used as a motor (step S3), and the control unit decides whether or not the control is finished (step S6). If the control is not finished, then the process proceeds to step S1. If the control is finished, then the operation is finished.",
        "In the case of YES in step S2, i.e., when the load L is decelerated, the control unit stops the supply of the electric power to the variable-speed motor 70 and switches connection of the variable-speed motor 70 to the work W (step S4). As a result, the variable-speed motor 70 acts as a generator to perform braking (step S5). Then, whether the control is finished or not is decided (step S6).",
        "FIG. 17 shows a modification of the embodiment shown in FIG. 12. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 17, the direct-coupling shaft 73 is coupled to the first rotating element of the first differential planetary gear unit P1 via a first speed-increasing or speed-decreasing gear 101. The output shaft 72 of the second differential planetary gear unit P2 is coupled to the second rotating element of the first differential planetary gear unit P1 via a second speed-increasing or speed-decreasing gear 102. The third rotating element of the first differential planetary gear unit P1 is coupled to the load L via a third speed-increasing or speed-decreasing gear 103 and the output shaft 80.",
        "Since the speed-increasing or speed-decreasing gears 101 through 103 are provided as described above, distribution of power flow can be optimized and operation manner of the load L can be diversified.",
        "According to the transmission apparatus of the present invention shown in FIGS. 12 through 17, because the joint unit is constituted by a combination of the second differential planetary gear unit and the variable-speed motor, a smooth speed-change operation can be performed by changing the speed of the variable-speed motor. Further, because the rotational power can be transmitted mainly via the coupling shaft serving as the direct-coupling shaft coupling the first differential planetary gear unit and the dividing unit, the capacity of the second differential planetary gear unit and the variable-speed motor as the joint unit can be small. As a result, it is possible to provide a transmission apparatus which can perform an efficient speed-change operation with small impact.",
        "The present invention is suitable for use in a transmission apparatus having at least one of a dividing unit and a differential planetary gear unit and having a joint unit."
