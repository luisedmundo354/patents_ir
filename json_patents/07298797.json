    "abstract": "An apparatus using transmitting antenna diversity to combat degradation due to fading in a wireless communication system. At least two symbols of four symbols to be transmitted through four transmitting antennas are rotated by predetermined phase values. An encoder configures four combinations for four input symbols so that a sequence of four symbols can be transmitted once by each transmitting antenna during each time interval. The combinations are transferred to the four transmitting antennas during four time intervals. Before the four input symbols are transmitted to the transmitting antennas, at least two symbols selected from the four input symbols are rotated by predetermined phase values. Therefore, the maximum diversity order can be obtained, a transmission delay time can be reduced, and the effect of fast fading can be reduced.",

A technique based on space-time block codes proposed by Vahid Tarokh et al., among techniques associated with antenna diversity, has been extended from a transmitting antenna diversity scheme proposed by S.

Here, the transmitter is based on a structure using four transmitting antennas 130, 132, 134 and 136.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1, the S/P converter 110 combines input symbols in units of four symbols and then provides the combined symbols to the encoder 120. The encoder 120 configures eight symbol combinations using the four symbols, and transfers, to the four transmitting antennas 130, 132, 134 and 136, the eight symbol combinations during eight time intervals.

        "Alamouti's space-time block code technique can obtain the maximum diversity order corresponding to the number of transmitting antennas without lowering a transmission rate although complex symbols are transmitted through two transmitting antennas. The transmitter and receiver proposed by Tarokh, shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, can achieve the maximum diversity order using space-time block codes based on a matrix having orthogonal rows, through the extension of Alamouti's space-time block code technique. However, only half the transmission rate can be achieved since the transmitter transmits the four complex symbols during the eight time intervals. Because the eight time intervals are needed to completely transmit four-symbol blocks generated by encoding the four input symbols, reception performance due to the change of a channel environment for block symbols is degraded in the case of fast fading.",

        "Where four-symbol sequences are transmitted using a 4\u00d74 code matrix, the fact that not all crossover terms can be removed at a time of carrying out an ML decoding operation was discovered by Tarokh. However, it is possible that four terms may be removed from the above Equation 5 and an ML decoding design can be thus simplified.",
        "On the other hand, a sequence of four symbols must be transmitted once to each antenna during each time interval so that the maximum diversity order can be achieved. Four types of 4\u00d74 code matrices satisfying the above-described orthogonality condition are shown in the following Equation 6. Other code matrices can be configured through a substitute operation for rows or columns of four matrices.",

        "Using the above Equations 9 and 10, the receiver de-couples a step of decoding a pair of x1 and x3 according to the above Equation 9 and a step of decoding a pair of x2 and x4 according to the above Equation 10. Thus, a structure of the receiver can be further simplified.",
        "Where input symbols are generated by BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying), that is, where input symbols are real symbols, the above-described code matrix constantly has the maximum diversity order. However, where a symbol mapping scheme of the third order or more based on a complex constellation is used, that is, where QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), 8PSK (8-ary PSK), or 16PSK (16-ary PSK) is used, symbols to be transmitted become complex symbols and hence the diversity order may decrease. In accordance with the present invention, the maximum diversity order of \u201c4\u201d can be obtained as two symbols, needed to decide different metric values, among four symbols are each rotated by predetermined phases. If this is done, symbols transmitted through the four antennas are expressed as a matrix as in the following Equation 12.",

        "In the above Equation 12, there is shown the code matrix where the symbols s1 and s4 of the input symbols s1, s2, s3 and s4 are rotated by phases \u03b81 and \u03b84, respectively. Optionally, a pair of s1 and s2, s3 and s4, or s2 and s3, each associated with different metric values, can be rotated. Even though phase values used for rotating the two symbols are different from each other or the same as each other, the maximum diversity order can be constantly maintained.",

        "In Eq. 15, U denotes an arbitrary unitary matrix. The code matrix in Equation 14 multiplied by an unitary matrix becomes another code matrix having similar properties as those in Eq. 14.",
        "The transmitter and receiver using the above-described code matrixes are shown in FIGS. 3 and 4.",
        "FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of a transmitter using space-time block codes in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 3, the transmitter includes an S/P (Serial-to-Parallel) converter 210, phase rotators 220 and 225, an encoder 230, and four transmitting antennas 240, 242, 244 and 246.",
        "Referring to FIG. 3, the S/P converter 210 combines four input symbols in the form of one symbol block and then provides the combined symbols to the encoder 230. At this time, before two symbols s1 and s4 selected from the one symbol block are inputted into the encoder 230, the phase rotators 220 and 225 rotate the two symbols s1 and s4 by phases \u03b81 and \u03b84, respectively. Here, the two symbols associated with different metric values are selected by the receiver. The encoder 230 configures four symbol combinations using the one-block symbols containing the phase-rotated two symbols and then transfers the four symbol combinations to the four transmitting antennas 240 to 246 during four time intervals. Here, each of the four symbol combinations includes four symbols.",
        "Here, the encoder 230 configures the combinations so that a sequence of four symbols must be transmitted once to each antenna during each time interval, thereby achieving the maximum diversity order. Further, the encoder 230 carries out the negate and conjugate operations for the input symbols to configure the combinations so that at least some sequences of symbol sequences to be transmitted to the respective antennas are orthogonal to each other, i.e., pairs of symbol sequences are orthogonal to each other. The reason why the two symbols selected from the input symbols are each rotated by predetermined phases is to achieve the maximum diversity order when the input symbols are complex symbols.",
        "Where the four combinations to be transmitted to the four antennas are expressed as a 4\u00d74 code matrix, symbols of the mth column of the code matrix are sequentially transmitted to the mth antenna. In other words, symbols of the nth row of the code matrix are simultaneously transmitted to the four antennas during the nth time interval.",
        "When the two symbols s1 and s4 of the symbols s1, s2, s3 and s4 have been rotated by phases \u03b81 and \u03b84, respectively, as an example, an output of the encoder 230 can be expressed as the 4\u00d74 code matrix as in the above Equation 12. When the code matrix shown in the above Equation 12 is used, the four symbols ej\u03b81, s1, s2, s*3 and e\u2212j\u03b84s4 of the first row are transmitted to the four antennas 240 to 246 during the first time interval, and the symbols e\u2212j\u03b84s*4, \u2212s*3, \u2212s2 and ej\u03b81s1 of the fourth row, being the last row, are transmitted to the four antennas 240 to 246 during the fourth time interval.",
        "FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of a receiver for receiving signals from the transmitter shown in FIG. 3. The receiver of the present invention includes two ML (Maximum Likelihood) decoders 340 and 345, which are independently operated.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4, a channel estimator 320 estimates channel coefficients indicating gains h1, h2, h3 and h4 of channels from the four transmitting antennas 240 to 246 to receiving antennas 310, 315, etc. A symbol arranger 330 collects signals r1, r2, r3 and r4 received by the receiving antennas 310, 315, etc. during four time intervals.",
        "If a single receiving antenna is provided in the receiver, the symbol arranger 330 collects the received signals r1, r2, r3 and r4 through the single receiving antenna during four time intervals. This is because the transmitter transmits block symbols during the four time intervals. On the other hand, where two receiving antennas are used, the symbol arranger 330 configures the received signals in the form of a matrix. Here, one row of the matrix has the signals received through the receiving antennas during one time interval and one column of the matrix has the signals received during respective time intervals. The time interval corresponds to the so-called symbol duration that is the inverse of signal bandwidth. The multiple antennas 310, 315, etc. are shown in FIG. 4, but the case where one receiving antenna is used will be described for convenience in explaining the present invention.",
        "Where the four symbols s1, s2, s3 and s4 transmitted from the transmitter are recovered, the first decoder 340 of the decoders 340 and 345 detects the symbols s1 and s3 according to the channel gains and received signals, and similarly the second decoder 345 detects the symbols s2 and s4. The four symbols s1, s2, s3 and s4 are simultaneously detected by the decoders 340 and 345. Here, the detected symbols are denoted by \u201cs\u2032\u201d so that they can be discriminated from the original symbols.",
        "Explaining the operation of the first decoder 340 where the code matrix of the above Equation 12 is used, a symbol generator 350 included in the first decoder 340 generates all possible symbol sub-combinations of s1 and s3, and a phase rotator 360 outputs ej\u03b81s1 by rotating one symbol s1 of the generated symbols by the same phase \u03b81 used in the transmitter.",
        "A metric calculator 370 calculates the above Equation 9 in relation to all possible symbol sub-combinations including the phase-rotated symbol using the estimated channel gains h1, h2, h3 and h4 and the received signals r1, r2, r3 and r4, thereby producing metric values. Then, a detector 380 detects s1\u2032 and s3\u2032 having the minimum metric values using the produced metric values.",
        "As described above, the operation of the first decoder 340 is the same as the operation of the second decoder 345. If the first detector 340 has detected s1\u2032 and s3\u2032 and the second detector 345 has detected s2\u2032 and s4\u2032, a P/S (Parallel-to-Serial) converter 390 sequentially arranges the detected symbols, and then outputs symbol combinations associated with s1\u2032, s2\u2032, s3\u2032 and s4\u2032.",
        "Phase values used for rotating the symbols in the transmitter and receiver shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 are decided according to the minimum coding gain of error matrices. Here, each error matrix is based on a matrix indicating a difference between erroneously detected symbols and originally transmitted symbols, and the minimum coding gain represents the product of all eigenvalues of the error matrices.",
        "FIG. 5 is a graph illustrating a result of a simulation indicating a change of the minimum coding gain associated with two phase values when QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) is used in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Here, it is assumed that the two phase values are the same as each other. A horizontal axis indicates a phase value, and a vertical axis indicates the minimum coding gain of an error matrix. If the phase value becomes a multiple of 90\u00b0, the minimum coding gain is zero. This is because an original constellation is made when a QPSK constellation is rotated by 90\u00b0.",
        "When the phase value is around 45\u00b0, {hacek over (N)}according to a result shown in FIG. 5, it is seen that the minimum coding gain is flat. Preferably, the phase value is 45\u00b0 in accordance with the present invention. FIG. 6 is an exemplary view illustrating a QPSK constellation when symbols are rotated by a phase of 45\u00b0. As shown in FIG. 6, the phase-rotated symbols are positioned on the real and imaginary axes. A preferable range of a phase rotation can be exemplified in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention. It is preferable that the phase rotation is based on a phase between approximately 21\u00b0 and 69\u00b0 {hacek over (N)} with a center of 45\u00b0 when the QPSK is used. Further, it is preferable that the phase is based on a phase between approximately 21\u00b0 and 24\u00b0 {hacek over (N)} when 8PSK (8-ary Phase Shift Keying) is used. Furthermore, it is preferable that the phase rotation is based on a phase of approximately 11.25\u00b0 when 16PSK (16-ary PSK) is used. However, the present invention is not limited to the above-described phase values. The preferable range of the phase rotation can be changed according to system characteristics.",
        "FIG. 7 is a graph illustrating the case where a proposed coding technique is compared with the conventional technique in terms of an SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) and a BER (Bit Error Rate). Here, a reference numeral 410 denotes the case where symbols not encoded are transmitted, and a reference numeral 420 denotes the (conventional) case where there is used an 8\u00d74 code matrix in which the rows proposed by Tarokh are orthogonal to each other. A reference numeral 430 denotes the efficiency where two antennas are used as proposed by Alamouti. A reference numeral 440 denotes the efficiency where a 4\u00d74 code matrix using the optimized phase of 45\u00b0 is used. A reference numeral 450 denotes the efficiency where a 4\u00d74 code matrix using the not optimized phase of 5\u00b0 is used. A reference numeral 460 denotes the efficiency where a 4\u00d73 matrix associated with three transmitting antennas is used. As shown in FIG. 7, it is seen that block codes using an optimized phase value in accordance with the present invention have a relatively low BER in the given SNR environment.",
        "As apparent from the above description, the present invention has the following advantageous effects.",
        "The present invention can achieve the maximum diversity order when a complex constellation is used, reduce a transmission delay time and reduce the effect of fast fading. In accordance with the present invention, rows of the code matrix can be orthogonal to each other, and a decoding design can be simply implemented.",
        "Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope of the invention. Therefore, the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments, but the present invention is defined by the claims, which follow, along with their full scope of equivalents."
