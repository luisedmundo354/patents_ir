    "abstract": "A system and method are directed towards enabling a server to activate a plurality of peer devices. The server may send a notification to a first peer device and employ subsequent peer devices to send further notifications to other peer devices in a sequence of peer devices, thereby reducing a number of notifications sent by the server. The peer devices may be mobile devices. In one embodiment, the notification indicates that data is available for download to the peer devices. In one embodiment, the sequence is dynamically determined by the server. In one embodiment, an instruction to send a notification to another peer device is provided to a peer device in the sequence along with the downloaded data. In another embodiment, the instruction is provided with the notification. In one embodiment, a notification may be sent using a hidden message mechanism of Short Message Service (SMS), or the like.",

        "Networked computing devices are typically configured to communicate with other devices to obtain or provide information and/or services. Typically, a client application may run on a local device and request information or a service from another device, such as a server. In some cases, the server may provide a notification indicating that information may be available for the local device from the server. For example, email notification daemons may be employed to asynchronously notify a mail client running on the local device of the arrival of email that may be subsequently retrieved from a mail server.",
        "More recently, mobile devices, such as mobile telephones, pagers, mobile personal data assistants (PDAs), or other wireless and handheld devices, have employed messaging technologies such as Multi-media Messaging Service (MMS), Short Messaging Service (SMS), Instant Messaging (IM), and the like, to request and receive information or services over a network. Such messaging technologies may also be used to provide an alert regarding an occurrence of an event.",
        "Messages are often employed to communicate notifications to mobile devices. However, it can be expensive to communicate large numbers of messages to mobile devices in part because each message may be separately charged to a data provider. Therefore, it is with respect to these considerations and others that the present invention has been made.",

In one embodiment, the devices are arranged as peer devices to each other device in the sequence such that each device is enabled to relay messages between each other device. In one embodiment, the devices are mobile devices.",
        "In one embodiment, the notification indicates that information, such as an application update is available for download, a message is available for access, or the like. Notification may also include, for example, event-based notifications, application wakeup messages, update or data availability messages, or the like. In general, a notification may alert a device, or a client application running on the device, of an occurrence of an event associated with the availability of information, enabling the device to initiate a data connection to the server to download the information. For example, a device may be notified of the availability of email, an instant message, a news report, sports score, stock price, weather forecast, updated personalized data for synchronization to the device such as a change to an address book, or the like.",
        "The sequence of devices may be determined by the server. In one embodiment, the sequence is dynamically determined. That is, an ordering of devices may be selected dynamically based on a variety of criteria, including, but not limited to, a characteristic of a device, a capacity of a device, an ordering that is directed towards minimizing a number of messages that may be sent from the server, or the like. Moreover, the sequence may be dynamically updated by the server to manage such issues as broken links in the chain that may arise due to a variety of reasons, including when a device is inaccessible, fails to send a notification to a next device, or the like. In addition, in one embodiment, the sequence need not be completely determined prior to sending a notification to a device.",
        "For example, in one embodiment, the first device and a next device in the sequence may be initially determined. Subsequent devices in the sequence may be determined after the notification process begins. Thus, in one embodiment, selection of a next device in the sequence may be made concurrently with, or prior to, sending of a notification to a device in the sequence.",
        "In one embodiment, the first device in the sequence may be notified by the server to initiate the notification sequence. The first device may then provide a notification to a next device in the sequence, which may then provide a notification to a subsequent device in the sequence, and so forth. In one embodiment, a last device in the sequence may send a message to the server indicating completion of the notification sequence. By employing the present invention, a plurality of devices may receive a notification, with the server merely providing the first notification. This approach may reduce the number of notifications sent by the server, and thereby may reduce costs to a data provider, or the like.",
        "A device in the sequence of devices may receive an instruction that directs the device to send a notification to another device. In one embodiment, the instruction may be provided to the device along with data that the device may download from the server. In another embodiment, the instruction to send a notification to another device may be included along with the notification received by the device.",
        "In one embodiment, the notifications may be sent using SMS's hidden message mechanism. Such hidden message mechanisms enable a computing device to send a message virtually without a user of the computing device being aware that the message is being sent. Thus, the sending of the message may be considered to be hidden from the user of the sending device. In one embodiment, the hidden message may be sent without a user input, an indication to the user via a user interface, or the like. In another embodiment, a receipt of a hidden message may also be hidden from the user of the receiving device. That is, the receipt of the hidden message may not be displayed on a user interface. Thus, in one embodiment, a computing device may receive a notification and send a notification to another device virtually hidden from a user of the computing device. However, in one embodiment, the user may still be provided an indication of a presence of downloaded information, such as an email message, update to an application, or the like.",
        "The invention is not limited, however, to SMS hidden message mechanism, and other hidden or automated message mechanisms may also be employed. For example, IM messages, MMS messages, or the like, may also be used, without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.",
        "With respect to embodiments that employ SMS capabilities for mobile devices, the invention may provide advantages due to pricing practices for SMS messaging. Mobile phone contracts may include a substantial periodic allowance of free SMS messages. Moreover, inexpensive bundles of SMS messages (typically in the hundreds or thousands) may be available for purchase from network operators, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), or the like. Economies may thus be achieved by enabling mobile device users to pay for one another's notifications at their own cost; a cost may be lower than the cost of sending each message from the notification server to a device, whether the data provider bears that cost or passes it on to the device users. A device user is effectively able to \u201ctrade in\u201d messages by allowing notifications to be sent from the user's mobile device to other devices in return for notifications being sent to the user, most likely from another user's mobile device. It is contemplated that in embodiments of the invention the use of a peer device to relay a notification to another peer device may be in accordance with an explicit grant of permission by the user of the device to the central data provider.",

        "In one embodiment, peer devices 112-114 may be configured to send and to receive a hidden message using such as an SMS hidden message mechanism, or the like. Such hidden messages may, for example, be sent or received by peer devices 112-114 virtually without a user action. Moreover, such hidden messages may be virtually hidden from a user, such that an alert, or other indication, might not be provided to a user interface on the peer device when the message is being sent and/or received.",
        "Peer devices 112-114 may also include at least one client application that is configured to initiate a network connection with another computing device, such as data server 104, another peer device, or the like, and to retrieve information from the other computing device. In one embodiment, the initiation of the network connection, and/or the retrieval of the information, may be performed virtually transparent to, or hidden from, the user of the peer device. In one embodiment, peer devices 112-114 may receive from data server 104 an instruction that directs it to send a notification to another peer device, using such as an SMS hidden message mechanism, or the like. In one embodiment, the instruction may be provided to peer devices 112-114 along with the data that is downloaded by the peer device. In another embodiment, information about the next peer device to which a notification is to be sent may be provided by data server 104, notification server 102, or even another peer device. In one embodiment, which peer device to send the notification may be provided as part of a notification from a prior peer device in the sequence of peer devices.",
        "In one embodiment, peer devices 112-114 may enable a user to operate the computing device to make requests for data and/or services from other computers on the network. Often, the requested data resides in computing devices such as data server 104, or the like. Thus, in this specification, the term \u201cclient\u201d refers to a computer's general role as a requester of data or services, and the term \u201cserver\u201d refers to a computer's role as a provider of data or services. In general, it is possible that a computer can act as a client, requesting data or services in one transaction and act as a server, providing data or services in another transaction, thus changing its role from client to server or vice versa.",

        "Memory 360 may include RAM 362, ROM 364, and other storage means. Memory 360 also provides data storage 372 and storage of programs, including, for example, operating system 371, client program 374, messaging application 376, and other applications 378. Such programs may include processor-executable instructions which, when executed on mobile device 300, cause transmission, reception, and other processing of audio data, video data, text messaging data, web pages, WML pages, and the like, and enable wireless communication with another device.",
        "Messaging application 376 is configured to receive and to send messages, including notifications. In one embodiment, messaging application 376 may receive and/or send notifications using a hidden message mechanism, such as described above.",
        "Messaging application 376 may further enable mobile device 300 to operate as a peer device using any of a variety of peer-to-peer messaging protocols. For example, messaging application 376 may employ a peer-to-peer messaging protocol that enables mobile device 300 to receive and/or relay messages to other peer devices.",
        "Messaging application 376 may further receive information indicating that content, such as an update to an application, at least a portion of an application, an email, or the like, is available for access by mobile device 300. In one embodiment messaging application 376 may, in part, establish a network connection with a data server, such as data server 104 of FIG. 1 to access the content. In one embodiment, the connection, and/or the access of the content may be performed virtually transparent to a user of mobile device 300.",
        "Generalized Operation",
        "The operation of certain aspects of embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. 4-7. FIG. 4 is a logical flow diagram generally showing an overview of one embodiment of a process for providing notifications to a plurality of peer devices. Process 400 may be performed, for example, by notification server 102 and/or data server 104 of FIG. 1.",
        "Process 400 is entered when it is determined that one or more notifications are to be sent to a sequence of peer devices (the notification sequence). When it is so determined, process 400 begins, following a start block, at block 402, where a notification is provided to the initial peer device in a sequence of peer devices. In one embodiment, the notification is provided as a hidden SMS message to the initial peer device.",
        "Processing flows next to block 404, where a notification is forwarded to each subsequent peer in the notification sequence. Each notification for subsequent peer devices may be provided by the previous peer device in the notification sequence. In one embodiment, a subsequent notification may be included with the data provided to a peer device that connects to data server 104 of FIG. 1. An instruction may also be included that instructs the peer device to send a notification to a next peer device in the notification sequence. In one embodiment, the notification may be sent as a hidden SMS message.",
        "In one embodiment, while an initial peer device and a second peer device in the notification sequence may be determined initially, a remainder of the notification sequence may be determined concurrently to providing of notifications, or even in a serial manner. In another embodiment, a portion of a sequence, or the entirety of a sequence, may be determined prior to the sending of the notification to the initial device in the sequence.",
        "Process 400 flows next to block 406, where data associated with a corresponding notification may be provided to each peer device within the notification sequence. Process 400 then returns to a calling process to perform other actions.",
        "FIGS. 5A-5B illustrate a logical flow diagram generally showing one embodiment of a process for providing a notification to peer devices in a sequence of peer devices.",
        "Process 500 begins, after a start block, at block 502, where a data server receives or otherwise determines that there is information for access by a plurality of peer devices. In one embodiment, at least one of the plurality of peer devices is a mobile device. In one embodiment, the information for access is at least one of an application, an update to at least a portion of an application, a message such as an email message or the like, a content item, data, or the like. In one embodiment, the data server may determine that there is a plurality of information that is available for access by the plurality of peer devices. Thus, for example, the data server may determine that an update to at least a portion of an application is available, and an email message is available, or that several updates to applications may be available, or any of a variety of other combinations.",
        "In any event, process 500 next flows to block 504, where a list of the plurality of peer devices may determined that are to receive a notification. In one embodiment, the data server may determine the list of peer devices. In one embodiment, information associated with one or more items available for access also may be provided to a notification server. The notification server may then determine the plurality of peer devices to send the notifications, based, at least in part, on the available information.",
        "Process 500 moves next to decision block 506, where a determination is made whether to send a notification to the plurality of peer devices. Such determination may be based on a variety of criteria, including, but not limited to, whether a threshold number of items are available for access by the plurality of peer devices. The determination may also be based, at least in part, on whether a determined time period has elapsed since receiving the information associated with the one or more items available for access. In still another embodiment, it may be determined that the information available for access includes a high priority item, such as a security update to an application, an urgent email message, or the like. In any event, if it is determined that a notification is to be sent, processing flows to block 510; otherwise, processing may loop back to decision block 506, until it is determined that a notification is to be sent.",
        "At block 510, an available peer device is determined from the plurality of peer devices for which an initial notification is to be sent. Determination of the first peer device to receive the initial notification may be based on a variety of criteria. For example, the first peer device may be based on a cost factor, a distance factor, a contractual agreement, a characteristic of the peer device, a number of items available for access, an availability of the peer device, or the like",
        "Moreover, a determination may also be made of a notification sequence for at least a portion of the plurality of peer devices. Such notification sequence may be ordered in such a way as to minimize the number of messages that are sent from the data server. For example, the notification sequence may be based on such criteria as geographic location of the peer devices, wireless networks on which peer devices may be communicating, a user preference regarding how frequently notifications may be provided, a usage limit applicable to the peer devices, or the like.",
        "Process 500 next moves to block 512, where a notification is sent to the selected initial peer device. In one embodiment, the notification is sent using an SMS hidden message mechanism.",
        "Processing next continues to block 530 (of FIG. 5B), where the initial peer device establishes a network connection and downloads the available information. In one embodiment, the initial peer device establishes the network connection with data server 104 of FIG. 1. In one embodiment, the establishment of the network connection, and/or the downloading of the available information may be performed virtually hidden from the user of the peer device.",
        "In one embodiment, the available information includes an instruction to the initial peer device to provide a notification to a next peer device in the notification sequence. Again, the instruction may further indicate that the notification is to be sent as a hidden message, using such as an SMS hidden message mechanism, or the like. In addition, the instruction may include a phone number of the next peer device for transmitting the SMS message or the like. However, the invention is not so limited, and other device identifiers may also be employed, including a Mobile Identification Number (MIN), an electronic serial number (ESN), a network address, or the like.",
        "Processing next steps to block 532, where the notification is provided to the next peer device in the notification sequence in accordance with the provided instruction. As described above, the notification may be provided as a hidden message. Furthermore, in one embodiment, additional information may also be provided to the next peer device that includes at least a portion of the notification sequence. That is, the next peer device may receive, either along with the notification or the downloaded information from block 532, information that may instruct the next peer device to instruct yet another peer device in the notification sequence to send a notification, or the like.",
        "Processing then advances to decision block 536, where it is determined whether this peer device is the final peer device in the notification sequence. If this peer device is not the final peer device, processing loops back to block 532; otherwise, processing flows to block 538.",
        "At block 538, the final peer device may have received an instruction directing it to provide a message to a server such as notification server 102 of FIG. 1 that confirms completion of the notification sequence. In one embodiment, the confirmation message may be sent using such as an SMS hidden message mechanism, or the like. Upon completion of block 538, processing may then return to a calling process to perform other actions.",
        "Although not illustrated in the above process flow, a peer device may be inaccessible for any of a variety of reasons, including, out-of-range, turned-off, an error, or similar failure that may result in its inability to receive and/or to send a notification. However, such situations may be detected using various mechanisms, including, for example, sending a message to the notification server if a peer device does not respond within a period of time, or the like. In any event, if it is determined that a peer device is non-responsive, the notification sequence may be dynamically revised. Such revisions may include dropping the non-responsive peer device, moving the non-responsive peer device into a different ordered position in the notification sequence, or the like.",
        "FIG. 6A is a time flow diagram illustrating one embodiment of a process for notifying each peer device in a notification sequence of data retrievable from a data server. In the embodiment, address information for notifying subsequent peer devices in the notification sequence may be included in the notification itself rather than in the data that is downloaded in response to the notification. For example, in one embodiment, the initial notification might include the address and ordering of each peer device in the notification sequence.",
        "Time flow diagram 600 shows notification server 602, data server 604, and a sequence of peer devices 610, 612, and 614. The vertical arrows extending from each device represent a flow of time, while horizontal arrows represent a flow of data from one device to another. An initial notification 620 may be sent by notification server 602 to peer device 610. Notification 620 may inform peer device 610 of the availability of data at data server 604 and may further include an instruction to provide notification 622 to peer device 612, the next peer device in the notification sequence. Peer device 610 may then provide notification 622 to peer device 612.",
        "Next, peer device 610 sends data request 630 to data server 604, which may be followed by data download 632. In one embodiment, substantially in parallel to these events, peer device 612 may send notification 624 to peer device 614, the next and final peer device in the notification sequence, in accordance with instructions that are included with notification 622 and received from peer device 610.",
        "After sending notification 624 to peer device 614, peer device 612 may send data request 634 to data server 604 and receives data download 636. Lastly, peer device 614 may send data request 638 to data server 604 and receive data download 640. Since peer device 614 is the final device in the notification sequence, it may not provide a notification to another peer device. However, in one embodiment, the final peer device in the notification sequence may provide a confirmation message to notification server 602, to indicate that the notification sequence is completed.",
        "FIG. 6B is a time flow diagram illustrating another embodiment of a process for notifying each device in a determined sequence of peer devices of data retrievable from a data server, in which an instruction to notify a subsequent peer device may be included in the content that is downloaded by a peer device in response to a notification, rather than being included in the notification itself.",
        "In time flow diagram 650, notification server 652 may send notification 670 to peer device 660, the initial peer device in the notification sequence. Peer device 660 then may send data request 680 to data server 654 and receive data download 682. Data download 682 may include an instruction to notify peer device 662, the next peer device in the notification sequence. Accordingly, peer device 660 may send notification 672 to peer device 662. Peer device 662 may then send data request 684 to data server 654 and receives data download 686. In accordance with instructions in the downloaded data, peer device 662 may send notification 674 to peer device 664, the final peer device in the notification sequence. Peer device 664 sends data request 688 to data server 654 and receives data download 692.",
        "FIG. 7 is a diagram showing two possible embodiments of notification formats that may be employed. Message 720 may correspond to the approach illustrated in FIG. 6A, while message 740 may correspond to the approach illustrated in FIG. 6B.",
        "Message 720 may include protocol-specific headers 722, one or more message chain addresses 724 for notifying subsequent devices in the notification sequence, and data 726. Protocol-specific headers 722 may include for example information indicating that the message is an SMS message, an IM message, or the like. Protocol-specific headers 722 may also include information indicating that the message is a notification, a hidden message, or the like. In one embodiment, message 720 is a hidden SMS message.
