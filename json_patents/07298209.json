        "The present invention relates to Class D amplifiers, and more particularly to an improved Class D amplifier.",
        "Amplifiers are typically used to amplify signals that are output to audio speakers, such as headphones, loudspeakers and/or other audio devices. In wired or non-portable applications, linear amplifiers such as Class A, Class B, and Class AB amplifiers have typically been used. Linear amplifiers include a linear output stage that draws a relatively high bias current while sourcing and sinking current into a load. Therefore, these linear amplifiers consume a relatively high amount of power. Because consumers buying portable audio equipment want to have longer battery life, linear amplifiers are not suitable for use in portable audio applications.",
        "Class D amplifiers have a nonlinear output stage that does not require the high bias current that is used in the linear amplifiers. The increase in efficiency of the output stage, however, is gained at the cost of increased noise and/or distortion. The tradeoff between power consumption and distortion and/or noise has generally been found to be acceptable in portable audio equipment applications.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, an exemplary Class D amplifier 10 is shown to include a sawtooth waveform generator 14. As can be seen in FIG. 2, a sawtooth signal Vsaw includes a positive sloped portion that increases from a minimum value to a maximum value followed by a return to the minimum value with an almost-infinite negative slope. The sawtooth signal Vsaw is input to an inverting input of a comparator 18. An input signal VIN such as an audio signal is input to a non-inverting input of the comparator 18.",
        "An output of the comparator 18 is input to first and second transistors 20 and 22 that are operated as switches. In this example, the first transistor 20 is a PMOS transistor and the second transistor 22 is an NMOS transistor. The output of the comparator 18 is also inverted by an inverter 24 and input to third and fourth transistors 26 and 28 that are also operated as switches. In this example, the third transistor 26 is a PMOS transistor and the fourth transistor 28 is an NMOS transistor.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 2, the sawtooth signal Vsaw is compared to the input signal VIN. When the input signal VIN is greater than the sawtooth signal Vsaw, the output is high. When the input signal VIN is less than the sawtooth signal Vsaw, the output is low. Alternately, when the input signal VIN is greater than the sawtooth signal Vsaw, the output is low. When the input signal VIN is less than the sawtooth signal Vsaw, the output is high. The transistors 20, 22, 26 and 28 are switched on and off to drive current through a load 40 as depicted in FIG. 1.",

        "Referring now to FIG. 3, a Class D amplifier 100 according to the present invention is shown. The Class D amplifier 100 includes a ramp generator 110 that generates a ramp signal (VRAMP) and an inverted ramp signal (V RAMP). As used herein, the terms ramp signal and inverted ramp signal refer to signals having alternating positive and negative slopes, which are substantially equal. The ramp signal VRAMP is output to a signal generator 111 that generates UP and DOWN signals for an output stage 118. The output stage 118 drives current through the load based on the UP and DOWN signals. The signal generator 111 includes an edge detector 114 and a phase detector 116. The ramp signal VRAMP, the inverted ramp signal V RAMP and the input signal VIN are output to the edge detector circuit 114.",
        "The edge detector circuit 114 outputs first and second pulses when rising and falling edges of the ramp and inverted ramp signals transition above and below, respectively, the input signal. In other words, the edge detector circuit 114 outputs a first pulse when VRAMP transitions from a value less than VIN to a value greater than VIN and a second pulse when VRAMP transitions from a value greater than VIN to a value less than VIN, respectively. The edge detector circuit 114 also outputs the first pulse when V RAMP transitions from a value less than VIN to a value greater than VIN and the second pulse when V RAMP transitions from a value greater than VIN to a value less than VIN, respectively.",
        "Outputs of the edge detector circuit 114 are input to a phase detector 116. The phase detector 116 sends an UP signal when the first pulse is received until the second pulse is received. When the second pulse is received, the phase detector 116 sends a DOWN signal until the first pulse is received. An output of the phase detector 116 is transmitted to an output stage 118, which drives current across the load based on the UP and DOWN signals.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 4, an exemplary implementation of the Class D amplifier 100 is shown. The edge detector circuit 114 includes comparators 119-1 and 119-2 and one-shot circuits 120-1 and 120-3 and 120-2 and 120-4, respectively. The ramp signal VRAMP is output to a non-inverting input of the first comparator 119-1. The inverted ramp signal V RAMP is output to a non-inverting input of the second comparator 119-2. The input signal VIN is input to inverting inputs of the comparators 119-1 and 119-2.",
        "Outputs of the comparators 119-1 and 119-2 are input to the one-shot circuits 120. In one implementation, the one-shot circuits 120-1 and 120-2 generate an output pulse when there is a positive edge sensed at the input thereof. The one-shot circuits 120-3 and 120-4 generate an output pulse when there is a negative edge sensed at the input thereof.",
        "Outputs of the one-shot circuits 120-1 and 120-2 are input to OR gate 130. Outputs of the one-shot circuits 120-3 and 120-4 are input to OR gate 132. Outputs of the OR gates 130 and 132 are input to a phase detector 116. The phase detector 116 operates in a manner that is similar to phase detectors in modern phase locked loops (PLLs). When there is no phase error in modern PLLs, a very small up and down pulse current is generated. In a Class D amplifier, however, voltage pulses are used instead of current.",
        "In one implementation, the phase detector 116 includes a flip-flop 142 that communicates with the output of the OR gate 130 and a flip-flop 144 that communicates with the output of the OR gate 132. D inputs of the flip-flops 142 and 144 are connected to a voltage bias VBB. A Q output of the flip-flop 142 provides a first or UP signal. A Q output of the flip-flop 144 provides a second or DOWN signal. The UP signal and the DOWN signal are fed back through an AND gate 150 and a delay 152 to reset (R) inputs of the flip-flops 142 and 144. The UP signal and the DOWN signal are also transmitted to an output stage 118, as will be described below. The ramp signal preferably has a frequency that is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the input frequency (e.g. 20 kHz and 1-2 MHz).",
        "Referring now to FIG. 5, the ramp signal VRAMP, the inverted ramp signal V RAMP, and an input signal VIN are shown. The UP signal is initiated on a rising edge of either the ramp signal VRAMP or the inverted ramp signal V RAMP crossing the input signal VIN. The DOWN signal is initiated on a falling edge of either the ramp signal VRAMP or the inverted ramp signal V RAMP crossing the input signal VIN.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 6, an exemplary output stage 118 includes an amplifier 180 that is switched on when the UP signal has a first state and off when the UP signal has a second state. The amplifier 182 is switched on when the DOWN signal has a first state and off when the UP signal has a second state.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 7, an alternate output stage 118 is configured as a single ended drive stage. The output stage 118 includes an AND gate 190 with inverted inputs, which are connected to the UP signal and a delayed DOWN signal. The UP signal controls a first switch 194. An output of the AND gate 190 controls a second switch 196. The first switch 194 selectively connects VDD to a node 200. The second switch 196 selectively connects the node 200 to ground. The delayed DOWN signal controls a third switch 198, which selectively connects the node 200 to negative VEE. The load 184 is connected between the node 200 and ground.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, the DOWN signal is delayed by at least the minimum pulse width of the phase detector 116 to avoid conflict between the switches 194 and 198. In a preferred embodiment, the delay is preferably at least two times the minimum delay described above. The switch 196 is on only when the UP and the delayed DOWN signals are inactive. In PLL applications, the DOWN signal does not need to be delayed because current is used. Therefore UP and DOWN signals can occur at the same time. With voltage signals, the DOWN signal is preferably delayed to avoid the crowbar short-circuit effect of both the top and bottom transistors being on.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 8, an alternate output stage 118 is configured as a balanced H-bridge implementation. The UP signal controls first and second switches 210 and 212 and is input to an AND gate 214 with inverted inputs. The delayed DOWN signal controls switches 218 and 222 and is input to AND gate 214, which has inverted inputs. The output of the AND gates 214 controls switches 230 and 232, which are connected across the load 184. The switches 210 and 222 are connected between VDD and nodes 234 and 236, respectively. The switches 218 and 212 are connected between the nodes 234 and 236, respectively, and ground.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 9, an alternate output stage 118 that is similar to the output stage in FIG. 8 is shown. The output stage 118 in FIG. 9 includes an additional switch 250 that is controlled by the output of the AND gate 214. The switch 250 is connected across the load 184.",
        "As can be appreciated, the output common mode of the output stages 118 that are shown in FIGS. 8 and 9 does not move around and is centered between the positive and negative power supplies.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 10, the signal to the load 184 can be filtered using one or more low pass filter circuits 300. The low pass filter circuits 300 may include one or more inductors and/or capacitors that remove high frequency switching components. For example, the filter may include a series inductor and a parallel capacitor. The optional filters 300 may not be needed if the load is an inductive load such as a loudspeaker load, which is mechanically similar to a low pass filter.",
        "Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the invention should not be so limited since other modifications will become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the specification and the following claims."
