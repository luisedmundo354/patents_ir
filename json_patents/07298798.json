    "abstract": "A method and system are disclosed for decoding block codes using a single decoder and trellis diagram. The signal can include at least one block code, and the block code can be modulated using at least one of a plurality of modulation modes. The block code contained in the signal can be selectively decoded based on the modulation mode for the block code using a trellis diagram corresponding to the modulation mode for the block code, for example, a low and high-rate CCK modulation mode or a differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK) Baker sequence modulation mode and a differential binary phase shift keying (DBPSK) Barker sequence modulation mode. The trellis diagram can have multiple embedded subtrellis diagrams in the trellis diagram. In this manner, multiple types of block codes and be decoded using a single decoder and trellis diagram.",

        "This invention relates generally to wireless communications and, more particularly, to a method and system for decoding block codes.",
        "The wide spread use of wireless devices in a network environment has increased the demand for wireless local area networks (\u201cWLANs\u201d) to provide high data rates at low cost. Complementary Code Keying (CCK) is one communication technique that can be used to meet this demand. CCK uses complementary polyphase codes for modulating digital information, which has been adopted by IEEE 802.11b as the modulation scheme for WLANs operating at 5.5 Mbit/s and 11 Mbit/s data rates in a 2.4 GHz band. These types of codes provide complementary sequences (\u201csymbols\u201d) having phase parameters, and possess symmetry ideal for transmitting digital information. Typically, at a high data rate of 11 Mbit/s, the codes are grouped as \u201ccodewords\u201d having 8-chips or a code length of 8. These codewords are a type of block code (\u201cblock codewords\u201d). In this case, 256 possible combinations of codewords may be used. Communication systems can thus extract digital information from a received signal modulated with CCK codewords by decoding the CCK codewords.",
        "One prior complementary code decoder is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,841,813 to van Nee and 5,862,182 to Awater et al., which extracts information data of a CCK codeword by correlating different samples of the received signal. For such a decoder, the signal-to-noise ratios degrade significantly after the differential correlators. Additionally, the decoder is not applicable for transmission of CCK codes in multipath environments.",
        "One possible decoding scheme for block codes is to match the received signal with all possible code patterns by correlators. A disadvantage of such a decoding scheme is that its complexity increases if the size of the block code is too large. Furthermore, this is an inefficient manner of decoding block codes such as CCK code. A low-complexity decoder for CCK was introduced by M. Webster and C. Andren, Harris/Lucent CCK description: additional cover code and fast transform detail, IEEE 802.11-98/331, September 1998, in which only a subset of CCK codewords are required to be correlated with the received signal by using a fast Walsh transform. However, this type of low-complexity decoder does not adequately address the problems caused by interference in multipath environments when decoding CCK codes.",
        "For instance, in multipath environments such as inside an office building, the delay spread of a received signal can cause interference during decoding of CCK codes and symbols within each CCK codeword contained in the received signal. In particular, multipath distortion caused by signals being reflected off of walls within the building can result in propagation delay of the received signal. This type of distortion or interference regarding CCK codewords is referred to as inter-symbol interference (ISI). Two types of ISI can occur: inter-codeword interference and intra-codeword interference. Inter-codeword interference is signal interference between codewords. Intra-codeword interference is signal interference between symbols within a codeword.",
        "One prior receiver is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,233,273 to Webster et al. that deals with inter-codeword and intra-codeword interference. This receiver is a channel-matched correlation receiver (\u201cRAKE\u201d) that uses a decision feedback equalizer to mitigate the effects of multipath distortion. A disadvantage of this receiver is that it requires high signal-to-noise ratios, but a low-signal-to-noise ratios error propagation in the decision feedback equalizer causes chip errors to occur in bursts. This degrades the reliability of decoding CCK codewords. Thus, to handle low signal-to-noise ratios, the RAKE receiver is required to examine all received codeword chips prior to making a codeword decision, which is an inefficient manner of decoding CCK codewords.",
        "One prior decoding technique has been introduced to decode and correct errors found in a signal encoded by a convolutional code. Convolutional code, unlike CCK codewords, is a continuous stream of data such as satellite data. This technique is commonly referred to as \u201cViterbi Decoding\u201d that uses a trellis diagram to find a maximum-likelihood path recursively over the trellis diagram to decode convolutional data, as described in A. J. Viterbi, Error bounds for convolutional codes and an asymptotically optimum decoding algorithm, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. IT-13, pp. 260-269, April 1967.",
        "Thus, what is needed is a block code decoder that can use Viterbi decoding techniques in order to reduce the computational complexity for decoding block codes and to handle multipath distortion in multipath environments or on multiple types of channels.",
        "According to one aspect of the invention, a method is disclosed for processing a signal containing at least one block code. The block code is modulated using at least one of a plurality of modulation modes in the received signal.

        "Reference will now be made in detail to implementations of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.",
        "The following implementations allow block codes contained in signal to be decoded using a single decoder and trellis diagram. The signal can include at least one block code, and the block code can be modulated using at least one of a plurality modulation modes. The block code contained in the signal can be selectively decoded based on the modulation mode for the block code using a trellis diagram corresponding to the modulation mode for the block code. For example, the modulation mode can be a low and high-rate CCK modulation mode or a DQPSK Barker sequence modulation mode and a DBPSK Barker sequence modulation mode. In this manner, multiple types of block codes can be decoded using a single decoder and trellis diagram.",
        "In the following description, a \u201cblock code\u201d can refer to any type of block code having a collection of codewords of a fixed length. For example, a CCK codeword can be one type of block code of length 8 thereby providing 256 possible combinations of codewords for high-rate CCK modulation. Other types of codewords are described below. Additionally, source information bits can be mapped to one codeword within a specific block code. For example, 8 bits of source information can be mapped to a high-rate CCK codeword, which can have up to 256 distinct codewords for high-rate CCK modulated codes.",
        "The following implementations and examples are described for decoding block codes such as CCK codes and Barker sequence codes using a trellis diagram for each type of code. However, any type of block code can be decoded using a trellis diagram representing all possible combinations of codewords for that type of block code.",
        "In the following description, a CCK codeword can be a block codeword having a code length of eight (8) at a chip rate of fchip, and can be denoted as c=(c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7, c8) where cl represents the ith symbol of the CCK codeword c. Each symbol can represent a complex number. Nevertheless, the following implementations are not limited to a block codeword length of 8 and can be implemented for codewords having any block codeword length such that a trellis diagram is provided with a path for each possible combination of the codeword. The following formula can be used to derive the CCK codeword c at a 5.5 Mbit/s low-rate modulation and a 11 Mbit/s high-rate modulation:\n\nc=(ej(\u03c61+\u03c62+\u03c63+\u03c64), ej(\u03c61+\u03c63+\u03c64), ej(\u03c61+\u03c62+\u03c64),\u2212ej(\u03c61+\u03c64), ej(\u03c61+\u03c62+\u03c63), ej(\u03c61+\u03c63),\u2212ej(\u03c61+\u03c62), ej\u03c61)\n\nwhere \u03c6i for i=1,2,3,4 belong to quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) phases, i.e., \u03c6i\u03b5{0,\u03c0/2,\u03c0,3\u03c0/2} for i=1,2,3,4. Thus, there are two types of CCK modulation modes or types: high-rate CCK modulation and low-rate CCK modulation.",
        "For high-rate CCK modulation, 8 information bits (d0 to d7) are carried by each transmitted codeword. In this manner, 256 possible codeword combinations can be modulated in a signal. The codewords can be generated by having \u03c61, \u03c62, \u03c63, and \u03c64 range over all possible QPSK phases, i.e.,\u03c61\u03b5{0,\u03c0/2,\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2{, for i=1,2,3,4. The four phases \u03c61, \u03c62, \u03c63, and \u03c64 can be encoded by the 8 information bits d0 to d7. For example, \u03c61 may be encoded from (d0,d1) based on the DQPSK modulation scheme, and \u03c62, \u03c63, and \u03c64 may be encoded from (d2,d3), (d4,d5), and (d6,d7), respectively, based on the QPSK modulation scheme.",

Furthermore, due to frequency offset and random phase error, a received signal can suffer from a phase rotation in both constant and random fashions. The timing/phase tracking module 110 outputs a decision of the timing error back to the interpolator 103, which can cause the sampling phase of the interpolator 103 to move forward the sampling point m (e.g., increase m by 1) or move backward the sampling point m (e.g., decrease m by 1) or stay at the current point (e.g., m remains unchanged) with the resolution of Tres.

These symbol components can be used with the trellis diagrams described above for decoder 108 to decode codewords contained in a received signal. The encoder 20 includes a phase mapper 801, converter 802, data processor 803, first and second delay elements 804 and 805, first and second coefficient operators 806 and 807, first and second adders 808 and 809, and first and second exponential operators 810 and 811.",

The phase representations u1, u2, u3, and u4 can be determined as described above. The phase mapper 801 outputs the phase representations u1, u2, u3, and u4 to converter 802.

For example, the data processor 803 can output a first sequence of variables in the order (a1,a3,a4,0) to a first delay element 804 and first coefficient operator 806 and a second sequence of variables in the order (a2,a2,a2,0) to a second delay element 805 and second coefficient operator 807. As described above, these variables describe intermediate states of a trellis diagram and be functions of u1, u2, u3, and u4, which are used to determine odd-phase and even-phase representations p2k\u22121 and p2k, respectively, of an encoded codeword.",

The first coefficient operator 806 receives the delayed first sequence of variables from the first delay element 804 and the first undelayed sequence of variables from the data processor 803. The first coefficient operator 806 performs a mapping function to transfer the first delayed sequence of variables and the first undelyaed sequence of variables into a first delayed coefficient sequence and a first undelayed coefficient sequence based on the timing order of elements in the first delayed sequence of variables and first undelayed sequence of variables.",

The first exponential operator 810 receives the odd-phase representation p2k\u22121 from the first adder 808 and generates exponential values of each of the odd-phase representations as odd elements c2k\u22121 for the encoded codeword.

The subdecoding unit can represent the internal components for a decoder over a subtrellis #N as shown in FIG. 10 or 11. The subdecoding unit can determine a path within a subtrellis diagram, which can be used for providing a codeword for the subtrellis diagram. Referring to FIG. 10, for example, the subdecoding unit of FIG. 9 can be implemented within each of the decoder over a CCK subtrellis #1 (1001) to decoder over CCK subtrellis #4 (1004). Furthermore, the subtrellis diagram of FIG. 7 can be embedded in a trellis diagram such as that shown in FIG. 3.",
        "Referring back to FIG. 3, the CCK trellis diagram can have four disjoint subtrellis diagrams for decoding CCK codewords using the algorithms noted above. Regarding the disjoint subtrellis diagrams, there is no connection between the subtrellis diagrams except for the initial state and the final state. The four subtrellis diagrams are identical to the subtrellis diagram shown in FIG. 7 except for the labels on the branches. Thus, each of the decoder over a CCK subtrellis #1 (1001) to decoder over CCK subtrellis #4 (1004) in FIG. 10 can be used to decode a codeword over a respective subtrellis diagram that can be embedded within a single trellis diagram.",

Additionally, each of the submodules can output a codeword or codeword candidate. In one example, one of the outputs from the submodules can be chosen as the decoded for a respective subtrellis diagram. The four states in the subtrellis diagrams are indexed by integers 0, 1, 2, and 3. The surviving paths are stored in a bank of registers and register exchanges are performed for surviving path updating. Since a codeword decision is made whenever a zero state is reached, i.e., whenever k=0 (mod 4), the tails of all the surviving paths are exactly the same as they first cross the zero state. This part of the surviving paths is called state-independent surviving path.",

For example, state processing unit 925 includes adders 912-1, 912-2 912-3 and 912-4. Each adder (e.g., 912-n) receives a selected one of the sixteen branch metrics, and selected one of the four path metrics of the previous states. Each adder adds the selected branch metric and selected path metric for generating a sum value of the two input items and outputs a sum value. The minimum value selector (e.g., selector 913) receives the sum values from the four adders and determines a minimum value from the inputs as the path metric for the state in question. The selector 913 also determines a symbol index 929 indicating the branch label having the minimum value.",

Second linear interpolators 1208 receives the plurality of received samples for forming three phase non-rotated timing-drift samples by interpolating from three selected consecutive samples of the plurality of received samples, and outputs the three phase non-rotated timing-drift samples. Third linear interpolators 1209 receives the negative phase rotated samples for forming three negative phase rotated timing-drift samples by interpolating from three selected consecutive negative phase rotated samples of the plurality of negative phase rotated samples, and outputs the negative phase rotated timing-drift samples.",
        "The summing processor 120 receives the previously decoded codewords and an estimated channel impulse response for summing the products of the decoded codewords and the estimated channel impulse response, and outputs a reconstructed signal 1215. Nine adding and squaring processors 1211 subtract the reconstructed signal from predetermined test vectors of three positive phase rotated timing-drift samples, three phase non-rotated timing-drift samples, and three negative phase rotated timing-drift samples from the first, second and third interpolators 1207, 1208, and 1209, respectively, and then square the magnitude of the subtracting result as a squared magnitude value. An accumulation and decision processor 1212 receives the squared magnitude values from the adding and squaring processor 1211 for accumulating the squared magnitude values, determining a timing shift responsive to a minimum of said accumulation, outputting said timing shift 1213. The accumulation and decision processor 1212 further determines a phase shift responsive to a minimum of said accumulation, and outputs the phase shift 1214.",
        "In the above examples, the components for the above decoders can be implemented in hardware such as, for example, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate array (FPGA) to perform the block code decoding techniques described herein. Alternatively, the above components can be implemented in software in which a digital signal processor (DSP) and one or more memory devices can be used to implement the block code decoding techniques described herein. Additionally, the above decoders can be configured or programmed using a combination of hardware and software to implement the block code decoding techniques described herein.",
        "Thus, a method and system for decoding block codes have been described. In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary implementations. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense."
