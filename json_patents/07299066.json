        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a portable telephone set attaching member and a portable telephone set, more particularly to assembly of a telephone set and an accessory component.",
        "2. Description of the Related Prior Art",
        "In recent years, a portable telephone set having many functions built-in has been widely used. For example, a portable telephone set with a camera can easily send an image photographed by the camera to a person on the other end of the line. However, since the camera is installed inside of the portable telephone set, the camera cannot be used independently or for other purposes by being detached from the portable telephone set (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-198849).",
        "Meanwhile, there is disclosed a portable telephone set with a detachable camera. Examples of the portable telephone set with the detachable camera are described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 2000-252144, 2000-253118, 2002-050978 and the like. Furthermore, a portable telephone set having a detachable liquid crystal display unit is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-208999, and a portable telephone set having a detachable card for data communication is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-209317.",
        "However, normally, it is difficult or impossible to carry a portable telephone set having an accessory device attached thereto. Moreover, when an accessory device such as a camera is attached integrally with a portable telephone set, the camera has a shape which makes it difficult for the camera to be used independently based on restrictions on designing of the portable telephone set.",
        "A portable telephone set attaching member according to one example of the present invention includes: a substrate part having a telephone set installation region and an accessory device installation region; a first connector that is connected with a telephone set; a second connector that is connected with an accessory device; and a wiring part that connects the first and second connectors with each other. A portable telephone set according to one example of the present invention includes: a substrate part; and a telephone set and an accessory device that are attached to the substrate parts. The substrate part includes: a first connector that is connected with the telephone set; a second connector that is connected with the accessory device; and a wiring part that connects the first and second connectors with each other.",
        "The telephone set installation region and the accessory device installation region, which are included in the above-described substrate parts, can be connected with each other by use of hinge parts or flexible members. A plate member including an opening can be disposed on an upper surface of at least one of the telephone set and the accessory device. The substrate and the plate member are connected with each other by use of fastenings. The telephone set can be set to be usable by entering predetermined ID information.",
        "By use of the portable telephone set described above, various functions can be used according to need. Moreover, the accessory device can be attached integrally to the portable telephone set and the portable telephone set can be easily carried around.",
        "The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken with the accompanying drawings in which:",
        "FIG. 1 is a plan view of a telephone set attaching member according to an embodiment;",
        "FIG. 2 is a plan view of a telephone set attaching member according to another embodiment;",
