        "The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of lavender known botanically as Lavandula stoechas and hereinafter referred to by the cultivar name \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019.",
        "The new Lavandula cultivar named \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 is one individual selection in the Australian lavender \u2018Ruffles Series\u2019, that resulted from a formal breeding program. The breeding program was established in November 2001 and conducted by the inventor, at the inventor's nursery in Victoria, Australia. The inventor, a specialist in the genus Lavandula, selected \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 in 2003. Selection was based on a combination of repeat flowering, dense plant habit, mid-pink sterile bract color, medium sterile bract length, and short peduncle length.",
        "\u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 is a selection arising from the controlled cross-pollination of Lavandula stoechas \u2018Kew Red\u2019 (unpatented) as the female parent, and Lavandula stoechas \u2018Pukehou\u2019 (unpatented) as the male parent. Cross-pollination of the parent plants took place in Park Orchards, Victoria, Australia in November 2001. From this cross the F1 generation was raised in February 2002 and grown to flowering maturity in September 2002. At this stage the F1 generation was self-pollinated and the seed sown in February 2003. From these F2 seedlings a selection was made when the plants had grown to flowering stage in 140 mm. containers.",
        "\u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 is a perennial suitable for use in container and in the landscape. Cultural requirements include full sun, adequate but not excess water, and well-draining soil. Mature height is 60 cm. and mature width is 70 cm. \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 exhibits early and repeat flowering, dense plant habit, scented green foliage, short peduncle length, and scented flower spikes with medium length sterile bracts that are mid-pink in color.",
        "The traits that distinguish \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 from the female parent \u2018Kew Red\u2019 are sterile bract length, and plant habit. \u2018Kew Red\u2019 exhibits short sterile bract length, and very dense plant habit, whereas \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 exhibits longer sterile bracts, and less dense plant habit. The traits that distinguish \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 from the male parent \u2018Pukehou\u2019 are peduncle length, plant habit, and sterile bract color. \u2018Pukehou\u2019 exhibits long peduncle length, medium to sparse plant habit, and purple sterile bract color, compared to \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 that exhibits short peduncle length, dense plant habit, and sterile bracts that are mid-pink in color.",
        "The new Lavandula cultivar, named \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 was first asexually propagated by the inventor in 2004. Asexual propagation was accomplished at the inventor's nursery in Australia, and the method utilized was tip cuttings. Since that time \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 has been determined stable, and reproduces true to type in successive generations of asexual propagation.",
        "The following traits have been repeatedly observed and represent the distinguishing characteristics of the new Lavandula cultivar named \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019. These traits in combination distinguish \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 from all other existing varieties of Lavandula known to the inventor. \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 has not been tested under all possible conditions and phenotypic differences may be observed with variations in environmental, climatic, and cultural conditions, without however, any variance in genotype.\n\n    \n    \n        1. \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 exhibits dense plant habit.\n        2. \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 exhibits scented flower spikes with sterile bracts that are medium in length and mid-pink in color.\n        3. \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 exhibits early and repeat flowering.\n        4. \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 exhibits fragrant green foliage.\n        5. \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 is one selection in the Australian lavender \u2018Ruffles Series\u2019 that blooms an average of two weeks earlier than many lavenders in commerce.\n        6. Cultural requirements for \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 are full sun, adequate but not excess water and well-draining soil.\n        7. \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 exhibits short peduncle length.\n        8. \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 is 60 cm in height and 70 cm. in width at maturity.\n        9. \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 is asexually propagated utilizing the method of tip and stem cuttings.\n        10. \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 is suitable for use as an ornamental plant is container or in the landscape.\n        11. \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 is hardy to USDA Zone 8.",
        "The accompanying drawings illustrate the overall appearance of the new Lavandula cultivar named \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019 showing the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in color reproductions of this type. Color in the drawings may differ from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description, which accurately describe the actual color of the new Lavandula variety named \u2018SUGARBERRY RUFFLES\u2019.
