At least a porous membrane is interposed between the first region and the second region by the engagement of the first connector and the second connector. According to this structure, a porous membrane is uniformly pressed between a first region and a second region, and excellent wells are formed by a plurality of through-holes.",

In this configuration, the porous membrane 22 is watertight and isolated by the through-holes 2, and a number of wells (sumps) W are formed in correspondence to the number of through-holes 2.",
        "FIG. 23 is a perspective view showing the structure of the instrument. The structure shows a porous membrane 22 and a filter paper 23 interposed between the top plate 1 and the bottom plate 11. The watertight isolation of the porous membrane 22 in each through-hole 2 is greater when a filter paper 23 is also interposed than when the porous membrane 22 alone is used, thereby reducing the fluid leakage from the through-holes 2.",

        "An instrument 21 assembled as shown in FIG. 8 is installed horizontally through the bottom surface gasket 37 of the concavity 32 of the body 31 of the immobilized sample preparation apparatus. After injecting or dripping a sample fluid containing a protein into each well W of the protein instrument 21, a suction pump (not shown) which is connected to the nipple 36 is operated.",
        "In this manner, the instrument 21 is attached air-tightly to the bottom surface of the concavity 32 through the gasket 37, and the sample fluid within each well W is suctioned through the porous membrane 22, such that the protein to be measured forms an immobilized sample on the membrane 22. In this case, an anchoring member may also be provided on the body 31 so as to press against and anchor the instrument 21 to the bottom surface of the concavity 32.",
        "Then, a labeled antibody is injected into each well W. After binding with a specific protein, a washing process is performed. In this manner, the immunocomplex of the detection target protein and the labeled antibody is prepared on the porous membrane 22. Then, the instrument 21 is disassembled and the porous membrane 22 is removed. The immobilized sample on the porous membrane 22 is optically measured and the amount of the target protein is calculated.",

The concavity 52 is provided with a flat bottom 54. The back surface of the assembly part 51 is provided with two sets of positioning concavities 53a and 53b.",
        "As shown in FIG. 12, the pressure part 41 is provided with two pressure clamps 43 which are symmetrically arranged, and two guide plates 45 horizontally arranged on a stationary plate 42. Positioning pins 45a and 45b respectively project at right angles from the two guide plates 45. In the present example, a commercial model HH450 (Misumi Corporation) is used for the pressure clamp 43. The pressure clamp 43 is provided with a toggle mechanism 44, such that an arm 47 is rotated in the direction of arrow G by pressing a handle 46 in the direction of arrow F so as to hold a rubber head 48 in a predetermined position.",
        "The sequence for assembling the instrument 21 shown in FIG. 8 is described below in terms of this structure.",
        "First, after a desired hydrophobic porous membrane 22 (FIG. 8) is placed in the porous membrane setting region 13 of the bottom plate 11 (FIG. 5), the bottom plate 11 is inserted into the concavity 52 of the assembly part 51 and placed so as to be horizontal on the bottom 54, as shown in FIG. 13.",
        "Next, the top plate 1 (FIG. 1) is inserted horizontally, on the concavity 52 with the channel 4 face down, so as to overlay the bottom plate 11, as shown in FIG. 14. Then, the rectangular flat plate 54 is inserted in the concavity 52 so as to be on top of the top plate 1, as shown in FIG. 15.",
        "Then, the assembly part 51 is placed on top of the two guide plates 45 of the pressure part 41 shown in FIG. 12. This time, the two sets of positioning pins 45a and 45b are respectively inserted into the two sets of concavities 53a and 53b on the back surface of the assembly part 51.",
        "Then, when each handle 46 of the two pressure clamps 43 is pressed in the direction of arrow F, each head 48 is rotated in the direction of arrow G, and the plate 54 is pressed and held in a pressured state, as shown in FIG. 16. In this manner, the convexity 14 of the bottom plate 11 is press-fitted onto the channel 4 of the top plate 1. In conjunction with this action, the porous membrane 22 is held under uniform pressure between the top plate 1 and the bottom plate 11. In this manner, the instrument 21 shown in FIG. 8 is completed.",

        "The press plate 62 is inserted horizontally below the instrument 21, as shown in FIG. 19, toward the open window 65 of the instrument support part 61. This time, the six stoppers 63 pass through the notches 15 of the bottom plate 11, and engage the margin of the bottom surface of the top plate 1.",
        "Next, the instrument support part 61 is inserted on the two guide plates 45 of the pressure part 41 shown in FIG. 12. This time, the two sets of positioning pins 45a and 45b are respectively inserted into the two sets of concavities 64a and 64b on the back surface of the instrument support part 61.",
        "Then, when each of the handles of the two pressure clamps 43 shown in FIG. 12 is pressed in the direction of arrow F, each head 48 is rotated in the direction of arrow G and presses the press plate 62. This pressure state is maintained. At the same time, the convexity 14 of the bottom plate 11 is extracted from the channel 4 of the top plate 1 by the eight extraction pins 64. In this manner, the bottom plate 11 is separated from the top plate 1, and drops downward. Then, the porous membrane 22 is removed from the dropped bottom plate 11.",

        "When the average fluorescent intensity of the immobilized background solution in group Gb of FIG. 20 is designated as the corrected background fluorescent intensity Ib, and a value 4 times the standard deviation is designated as the measurement lower limit of detection Imin, the following may be derived from actual measurements.",
        "Ib=176.3 (count/mm2)",
        "Imin=35.4 (count/mm2)",
        "The calibration curve shown in FIG. 22 is prepared by subtracting Ib from the fluorescent intensity Is of the immobilized standard reagent in the standard series group Gs, and by calculating the net fluorescent intensity Iso. One ng/50 \u03bcL of the standard reagent of section (2) allows recognition of 1 U/50 \u03bcL of CDK1 in the sample.",
        "In regard to the ten specimens and two control specimens, the average fluorescent intensity was calculated for each two wells, respectively. Ib was subtracted and the net fluorescent intensity was calculated. The CDK1 concentration in each specimen was calculated using the calibration curve of FIG. 22 from the calculation results. These calculation results are shown in FIG. 21.",
        "In FIG. 21, specimens having a net fluorescent intensity less than Imin are designated by ND (not measurable). In the control specimens, HL60 is known to be 150 to 250 count/mm2, and Jurkat is known to be 380 to 550 count/mm2. Since the values of HL60 and Jurkat are within this range in FIG. 21, these measurements are judged to be correct.",
