        "The subject of the invention is a method for preparing oligomeric polyisocyanates containing at least one uretdione group by dimerization of starting monomeric isocyanates with the aid of catalysts of the superacid family.",
        "The invention more particularly relates to a method for the catalytic cyclodimerization of monomeric isocyanates, which has a high selectivity.",
        "Polyisocyanates containing uretdione groups, known by the name \u201cdimers\u201d, are synthesized by cycloaddition (2+2) of two aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic isocyanate molecules.",
        "While aromatic isocyanates can cyclodimerize in the absence of catalyst at room temperature, it is known that the other isocyanates require the use of basic catalysts such as trialkylphosphines, N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraalkylguanidines, 1,2-dialkylimidazoles, and the like.",
        "In general, these catalysts are however not very selective and, apart from the dimerization reaction, also promote the formation of trimeric polyisocyanates with a predominantly isocyanurate structure by cyclotrimerization of the starting monomeric isocyanates, resulting in the formation of polyisocyanate compositions having a smaller or larger proportion of compounds with isocyanurate groups apart from the polyisocyanates containing uretdione groups.",
        "To overcome the problem of the selectivity of the dimerization catalyts, it has been proposed to use compounds falling into the generic classes of N,N-dialkylaminopyridines, 4-(N-arylalkyl-N-alkyl)aminopyridines and tris(N,N-dialkyl)phosphotriamides. Concrete examples of the first group are 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (designated by \u201cDMAP\u201d), 4-pyrrolidinylpyridine, while a concrete example of the second group is 4-(N-benzyl-N-methyl)aminopyridine (designated by \u201cBMAP\u201d), and while a concrete example of the third group is hexamethylphosphotriamide (HMPT).",
        "These catalysts, which are derived from aminopyridines, may also be useful for acylation or urethane forming reactions.",
        "For further information, reference may be made to the work by E. F. V. Scriven, Chem. Soc. Rev., 129, (1983) and by G. Hofle et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 17, 569, (1978).",
        "The work of the inventors who carried out the present invention has made it possible to demonstrate that, unexpectedly, the compounds of the superacid family constitute excellent dimerization catalysts, which make it possible to obtain dimeric polyisocyanates containing a uretdione unit with high selectivity and yield.",
        "The expression \u201chigh selectivity\u201d for the purposes of the invention is understood to mean that the isocyanate functional groups of the starting monomers predominantly react with each other to form compounds having uretdione groups. Compounds having isocyanurate groups may also be formed, but in a minor quantity.",
        "The compounds may have a single uretdione group, in which case reference is made to \u201ctrue dimers\u201d or several uretdione groups, in which case reference is made to \u201coligodimers\u201d or to \u201cpolydimers\u201d. The oligodimers may be in particular bis- or tris-uretdiones or heavy compounds having more than three uretdione rings and are considered as polydimers.",
        "It is however not excluded that it may even be advantageous for the compounds of the invention to also catalyze the reaction of isocyanate functional groups with other reactive functional groups with the isocyanate functional group generally possessing functional groups with a labile hydrogen, in particular alcohol or thiol functional groups, and the like. Amines are in this case not being preferred because of the protonation of the dimerization catalyst by them.",
        "The subject of the invention is a method for preparing polyisocyanates by cyclodimerization of isocyanate functional groups carried by starting monomeric isocyanates, characterized in that it comprises the steps of:",
        "a. providing a reaction medium comprising starting monomeric isocyanates, optionally in the presence of a solvent;",
        "b. adding to this reaction medium a (cyclo)dimerization catalyst comprising a compound of the superacid family;",
        "c. heating the reaction medium at a temperature in the range between 0\u00b0 C. and 300\u00b0 C., advantageously from 20\u00b0 C. to 200\u00b0 C., until the desired rate of conversion of between 1 and 95%, advantageously 5 and 50%, of the initial isocyanate functional groups is obtained;",

        "e. optionally removing the unreacted monomers.",
        "The expression \u201ccompound of the superacid family\u201d is understood to mean any compound, or mixture of compounds, whose acidity constant defined by Hammett is strictly less than \u221212. For the definition of the acidity constant according to Hammett, reference-may advantageously be made to the book by J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, third edition, John Wiley and Son, pp 223 sqq.",
        "Thus, the superacids used in the present invention are defined as being acids whose Hammett acidity constant \u201cH\u201d is strictly less than \u221212 and, by way of example, are chosen from sulfonic acids, sulfonimides, sulfonylmethanes, phosphorus fluorides, antimony fluorides, boron fluorides (and hydrofluorides), and the like, alone or as a mixture, and derivatives thereof.",
        "Thus, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid has an H acidity constant equal to \u221214, fluorosulfonic acid an H acidity constant of \u221215. Mixtures of superacids, such as the FSO3H/SbF5 mixture, also called \u201cmagic acid\u201d make it possible to reach still lower H values, and for example \u221221 in the case of a 5% mixture of antimony pentafluoride in hydrofluoric acid.",
        "The catalysts of the superacid family used in the method of the present invention are more particularly chosen from superacids which cannot be dehydrated, that is to say those whose chemical structure does not allow their conversion to an anhydride, under operating conditions of the reactions for dimerization of the monomeric isocyanates of the invention.",
        "Such acids generally possess at least one highly labile hydrogen atom or can promote the formation of at least one highly labile hydrogen atom in the reaction medium. The presence of this highly labile hydrogen atom is generally due to the presence, in the chemical structure of the superacid, of at least one highly electron-attracting atom or group.",
        "The attracting atom or group is preferably chosen from functional groups whose Hammett constant \u03c3p is at least equal to 0.1. It is in addition preferable for the inductive component of \u03c3p, \u03c3i, to be at least equal to 0.2, advantageously to 0.3. In this regard, reference may be made to the book by J. March, ibid., pp. 242-250, and in particular to Table 4 of this section.",
