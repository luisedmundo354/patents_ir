The service cart of the present invention also comprises drawer handles that do not extend beyond a front surface of the drawers of the service cart or do not extend substantially beyond the front faces of the flanking protective bumpers. The service cart comprises features that prevent or minimize damage to the service cart, or to an object struck by the service cart, when the service cart engages another object. The protective bumpers attached to the outer side of each vertical corner of the service cart extend along at least a substantial portion of the height of the vertical corners to absorb a significant portion of an impact between the service cart and the other object. The drawer handles are attached to recessed surfaces in the front surfaces of the drawers and are advantageously bar type handles or extruded handles that comprise a gripping surface. A push handle may also be provided on the service cart and may comprise a protective overmold. Indicia indicating the manufacturer or retailer or other information may also be defined on various surfaces of the service cart, such as on the protective bumpers, the drawer handles, and/or the push handle.",

        "This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/746,412, filed Dec. 24, 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,144,020, which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.",
        "The present invention is related to transportable service carts, of the type commonly used for the convenient storage and transportation of items.",
        "Service carts of the described type come in a variety of shapes and sizes that are typically tailored to a specific application or for use with particular items. They usually comprise a storage compartment and a plurality of wheels. The storage compartment may also comprise surfaces and/or shelves that provide a support surface for the stored items and may comprise drawers, cabinets, or other components that may completely enclose the stored items. The plurality of wheels is provided for convenient transport of the service cart.",
        "One application for a service cart is in automotive repair facilities, wherein the service cart stores a technician's tools. The service cart may be transported to the approximate area that the technician is working, typically near a vehicle, to provide convenient access to the stored tools. Occasionally, a service cart will strike a vehicle while the vehicle is in the automotive repair facility, which is undesirable because such impacts between the service cart and vehicle may damage the exterior of the vehicle or the service cart and may damage the internal components of the vehicle or the stored items in the service cart. Repair facility equipment may also come into contact with the service cart on occasion. Such equipment may comprise shelving, vehicle lift systems, or other machinery that may also be damaged if impacted by a service cart.",
        "The damage to the struck object or the service cart is typically caused by the extremities of the cart, such as the corners of the cart, protruding shelves, protruding handles, or the like. The extremities of the cart are most likely to come into contact with other objects, and the extremities often define relatively sharp features, such as a non-radiused corner or a corner with minimal curvature. Such sharp features concentrate the impact on the struck object during the impact, which increases the amount of damage to the object rather than dispersing the impact over a larger area and reducing the damage.",
        "Therefore a need exists for a transportable service cart that reduces or prevents damage to struck objects and the service cart when the service cart impacts other objects. A further need exists for a transportable service cart that reduces the likelihood of impacts between a service cart and other objects.",
        "The invention addresses the above needs and achieves other advantages by providing a transportable service cart that comprises a generally box-like frame having four vertical corners that extend from a bottom portion of the service cart to a top portion to define a height of the service cart. A storage component is mounted within the frame. Alternatively, the service cart comprises a storage compartment without a frame, such that the storage compartment defines the vertical corners of the service cart. A plurality of wheels is joined to the bottom portion of the service cart so that the service cart is transportable. At least one protective bumper is attached to overlie an outer side of at least one vertical corner and extend along at least a substantial portion of the height of the service cart. Accordingly, when the service cart strikes another object, the protective bumpers are more likely to engage the other object such that the impact is dampened and dispersed to reduce or prevent damage to the struck object or service cart.",
        "The protective bumpers of the present invention advantageously are a blow molded material, such as polyethylene, and may define indicia to identify the manufacturer or retailer of the service cart. Fasteners or adhesives may be used to attach the protective bumpers to the corners of the storage compartment. In addition, the service cart may also comprise a push handle on a side of the service cart, wherein the push handle may comprise an overmold that comprises a gripping surface and defines indicia.",
        "An alternative service cart of the present invention, which may or may not comprise the protective bumpers on the vertical corners of the service cart, comprises slidably mounted drawers in the storage compartment. The drawers define at least one recess in a front surface of the drawer such that the recess defines a recessed surface. A drawer handle, such as a bar type handle or extruded handle, is attached to the recessed surface of the drawer. The drawer handle advantageously does not extend beyond or substantially beyond the front surface of the drawer. If the protective bumpers are provided, the drawer handle advantageously does not extend beyond or substantially beyond the front face of the flanking protective bumpers. The service cart also comprises a plurality of wheels joined to the bottom portion of the service cart so that the service cart is transportable. Accordingly, objects struck by the service cart of the present invention are less likely to impact the drawer handles of the service cart, which not only reduces the number of impacts between the service cart and other objects, but also prevents the concentration of the impact on the relatively small surface of the handle. Therefore, the service cart with the recessed drawer handles reduces or prevents damage to the other object and the service cart.",
        "Service carts of further embodiments may define recesses defining generally hexagonal shapes or elliptical shapes into which the bar type drawer handle is attached. Alternatively, the extruded drawer handle may be attached to a recessed surface that substantially extends along the longitudinal length of the drawer so that the extruded handle substantially extends along the longitudinal length of the drawer. The drawer handles may also define indicia on a surface of the handles opposite the gripping surface of the respective handles.",
        "Therefore, the present invention provides a service cart with protective bumpers and/or recessed drawer handles so that damage to a struck object or the service cart is reduced or prevented when the service cart impacts another object.",

        "Because the vertical corners 35 of the service cart 10 are the most likely portions of the service cart 10 to contact another object, the present invention provides protective bumpers 46 attached to at least one support 34 to reduce the impact between the service cart and the struck object (not shown). The protective bumpers 46 of FIGS. 1-6 overlie an outer side of each vertical corner 35 of the service cart 10. The outer side of each vertical corner 35 of the illustrated embodiment comprises the surfaces of the support adjacent the vertical corner and the surface defining the vertical corner. The outer side of the vertical corner 35 of FIG. 2 defines a curved corner surface and two linear surfaces that are tangential to the vertical corner 35. Further embodiments of the service cart may define an outer side of the vertical corner with alternative surfaces that define any relative orientations and distances. Moreover, the outer side of the vertical corner of alternative embodiments of the present invention may define only the curved corner surface or one or more linear surfaces so long as the vertical corner is protected by the overlying protective bumper from impacts from multiple directions.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the protective bumper 46 of the present invention preferably comprises two front faces 48 and a rounded face 50. The front faces 48 each overlie the linear surfaces tangential to the vertical corner 35, while the rounded face 50 overlies the curved corner surface of the vertical corner. As shown in FIG. 1, the forward facing front faces 48 of the two protective bumpers 46 attach to the front vertical corners 35 of the service cart 10, such that the two protective bumpers flank the drawers 20. The two forward facing front faces 48 of the flanking protective bumpers 46 flank the drawers 20 such that the front faces are located on either side of the drawers 20. The protective bumpers 46 define a bumper depth, as illustrated in FIG. 3, from the respective panel of the storage compartment 19, such as the front panel 36, to the front face of the protective bumper, such as the forward facing front face 48 of the flanking protective bumper. In the illustrated embodiments of the present invention, the front panel 36 of the storage compartment 19 is in substantially the same plane as the front surfaces of the drawers 20 in a slidably closed position. Accordingly, the bumper depth also defines the perpendicular distance from the front surface of the drawer 20 in a slidably closed position to the forward facing front faces 48 of the flanking protective bumpers 46. The bumper depth in embodiments of the service cart 10 with vertical supports 34 may include the thickness of the vertical support in the bumper depth, as shown in FIG. 3. Advantageously, the bumper depths of the two front faces 48 of the flanking protective bumpers 46 are equivalent. However, the front faces of further embodiments of the protective bumpers may define any relative bumper depths. The rounded face 50 advantageously defines a radius that is preferably greater than or equal to the radius of the vertical corner 35 of the service cart 10 which the protective bumper 46 overlies, as shown in FIG. 2. In addition, the rounded face 50 advantageously defines a thickness that is equal to or greater than the bumper depth of the front faces 48. Further embodiments of the present invention may comprise a rounded face having any relative radius, or no radius at all, and having any relative thickness. In addition, protective bumpers of still further embodiments may each comprise only two front faces attached proximate to the vertical corner of the service cart, wherein the front faces define bumper depths sufficient to protect the vertical corner.",
        "The protective bumper 46 advantageously defines a hollow portion 52 between an outside surface of the protective bumper and the vertical corner 35 of the service cart 10, such that the hollow portion is between two layers of the protective bumper 46, as shown in FIG. 2, or the hollow portion is between a single layer of the protective bumper, which is the outside surface of the protective bumper, and the vertical corner of the service cart. The hollow portion 52 reduces the amount of material required to manufacture the protective bumpers 46, thus reducing the cost of the protective bumpers, and provides more flexibility to the protective bumper, which improves the deflection and absorption of an impact between the service cart 10 and a struck object. The hollow portion 52 advantageously extends within the front faces 48 and the rounded face 50 to define one hollow portion along a cross section of the protective bumper 46, as shown in FIG. 2. Further embodiments of the service cart may comprise protective bumpers with hollow portions of different shapes or with no hollow portion, such as the protective bumper shown in FIG. 3.",
        "The protective bumper 46 of the illustrated embodiment is attached to the service cart 10 with fasteners 54. As shown in FIG. 2, the protective bumper 46 comprises orifices 56 that can be aligned with through holes 58 in the support 34 and storage compartment 19 such that the fastener 54 can pass through the orifice and through holes to be threaded into a nut 60 on the inside of the storage compartment. The protective bumper 46 of FIG. 2 is fastened through each front face 48 at equivalent vertical heights; however, further embodiments of the protective bumper may comprise any number or arrangement of fasteners to attach the protective bumpers. Furthermore, the protective bumpers 46 may be attached with alternative fasteners, such as screws or bolts threaded into threaded holes of the support and/or storage compartment, as well as rivets or snap buttons, to list a few non-limiting examples. Alternative protective bumpers 246, such as the bumpers of FIG. 6, may be adhered to the support 234 with an adhesive applied between a surface opposite the front face 248 and/or the rounded face 250 and the vertical corner of the service cart 210. Further embodiments of the present invention may attach the protective bumpers in alternative ways; non-limiting examples include joining the bumper material directly onto the storage compartment during the manufacture of the protective bumper or fabricating the storage compartment to retain the protective bumpers.",
        "The protective bumpers 46 of FIGS. 1 and 2 are preferably manufactured from a high density polyethylene (HDPE), or similar flexible material, for improved impact absorption. HDPE is a relatively hard material compared to an elastomer or other soft material, it may be blow molded to form bumpers with various indicia, and it would be more durable and provide a more attractive appearance than some elastomers or other soft materials. The blow molded bumpers could also provide a double wall construction for the hollow portion 52, which provides flexibility and absorbs impact energy to avoid or minimize damage to other surfaces. Alternative embodiments may be manufactured from an elastomer material because of its resilience and durability or from other polymer materials or soft metals, such as aluminum, that define a minimum thickness to flex and thereby absorb the energy of an impact with minimal aesthetic damage to the protective bumper. Further embodiments of the service cart 10 may comprise protective bumpers of alternative material. The protective bumpers 46 advantageously are capable of flexing and absorbing impacts to reduce damage to the service cart 10 and struck objects such that the protective bumpers are not plastically deformed. The protective bumpers 46 are also advantageously manufactured from a material that will not deteriorate with time or exposure to sunlight, certain chemicals, or other environmental conditions.",
        "The protective bumpers 46 of the service cart 10 of the present invention are advantageously manufactured by blow molding or thermoforming, which are well known in the art. The protective bumpers 46 of the illustrated embodiments are advantageously blow molded HDPE, which are blow molded prior to being attached to the service cart 12. The protective bumpers 46 of the illustrated embodiment define indicia 62 on the front face 48, which may be used to indicate the manufacturer or retailer of the service cart 10 or provide alternative information. The indicia 62 may protrude outward beyond the front face 48 or may be recessed in the front face. Advantageously, the molds used to manufacture the protective bumpers 46 may comprise interchangeable portions so that the indicia 62 can be edited, replaced, or removed as desired by the manufacturer. The illustrated embodiments define indicia 62 on the forward facing front faces 48 on the front panel 36 of the storage compartment 19 only; however, further embodiments of the present invention may define indicia on the front faces on the front, left, right, and/or back panels of the storage compartment and/or on the rounded faces of the protective bumpers. In addition, indicia may be defined on the rounded face 50 of the protective bumper 46.",
        "Advantageously, the attached protective bumpers 46 extend along at least a substantial portion of the height of the service cart 10, as show in FIGS. 1, 5, and 6 to provide protection for the service cart and objects that may be struck by the service cart. The protective bumpers 46 are not required to extend the entire height from the bottom surface 32 to the top lid 26, but only along a substantial portion of the height. For example, the protective bumpers 46 extend at least 25% of the height of the service cart 10, and more preferably extend at least 50% of the height of the service cart, and even more preferably extend at least 75% of the height of the service cart, thereby extending at least a substantial portion of the height thereof. In further embodiments of the service cart 10, the protective bumpers 46 extend at least along the top portion 18 of the service cart. The protective bumpers 46 of the illustrated embodiments overlie a substantial portion of the vertical corners 35 of the service cart 10 such that the corners are protected from other objects. The protective bumpers 46 comprise one protective bumper attached to each vertical corner 35, wherein the individual protective bumpers define a generally consistent cross-sectional area, as shown in FIG. 2, without interruptions, other than to provide clearance for the push handle of the service cart, as shown in FIG. 1. Protective bumpers of further embodiments of the present invention may comprise two or more individual protective bumpers on a single vertical corner of the service cart. Still further embodiments of the present invention may provide protective bumpers of alternative shapes and arrangements to significantly protect the service cart.",
        "To facilitate the transport of the service cart 10, the service cart advantageously comprises a push handle 64, as illustrated in FIG. 1. The push handle 64 of the illustrated embodiments is joined to the supports 34 of the frame 12 on sides of the supports that are generally perpendicular to the front panel 36 of the storage compartment 19. The push handle 64 may alternatively be joined to the left panel 40 of the storage compartment 19, which is also generally perpendicular to the front panel 36 of the storage compartment. If the service cart 10 comprises drawers 20 that define a generally planar front surface 66 that is generally parallel to the front panel 36 of the storage compartment, the push handle 64 extends along a direction that is generally perpendicular to the front surface of the drawers. The push handle 64 of FIG. 1 is an extruded handle that defines two ends 68 and comprises a bracket 70 extending from each end of the push handle. The bracket 70 provides a space between the push handle 64 and the surface of the service cart 10, such as the supports 34 of the frame 12, to which the bracket is joined. The bracket 70 is advantageously joined to the support 34 with fasteners, similar to fasteners described for the protective bumper 46, or the bracket may be joined by alternative devices. The bracket 70 may also define indicia 62, as is shown in FIG. 1. Further embodiments of the bracket 70 may comprise a polymer material joined, either permanently or removably, to the bracket to absorb impacts between the bracket and other objects. Such a bracket 70 may include an opening such that the indicia 62 on the bracket are visible.",
        "The push handle of the illustrated embodiment comprises an overmold 72 that is axially inserted over the push handle 64 before the brackets 70 are joined to the push handle. An alternative overmold 72 may be wrapped about the push handle 64 if the push handle is rigidly joined to the brackets 70, which would prevent the axial insertion of an overmold onto the handle. Further embodiments of the push handle may comprise alternative overmolds. The overmold 72 of FIG. 1 provides a cushioned gripping surface 74 for the person pushing the service cart 10 to grip and may comprise finger grooves on the gripping surface to provide an improved grip on the push handle 64. The overmold 72 is advantageously a polymer material, such as HDPE or an elastomer to list two non-limiting examples, and may define indicia 62 on the overmold to identify the manufacturer or retailer, or to provide information to the user of the service cart 10. Overmolds of further embodiments of the present invention many be manufactured from any material and may define alternative indicia or no indicia.",
        "Because the push handle 64 defines a surface that projects beyond the protective bumpers 46 in the illustrated embodiments, the overmold 72 provides an impact absorbing surface to reduce damage to the service cart 10 or other object if the push handle strikes another object. The overmold 72 advantageously extends over the bracket 70 to cover the outermost surfaces of the bracket, as shown in FIG. 1. Further embodiments of the present invention may comprise alternative push handles, recessed push handles that do not extend beyond the protective bumpers, or no push handles.",
        "The service cart 10 of the present invention also provides recessed drawer handles to reduce or prevent damage caused when the handles of a service cart strike an object. The drawers 20 of the service cart 10 of FIGS. 1 and 4 comprise recesses 76 that define a generally hexagonal shape.

The overmold may be axially inserted on the drawer handle, either the bar type or extruded handles, or may be wrapped about the drawer handle. The recessed drawer handles comprising an overmold preferably do not extend beyond or substantially beyond the front surface of the drawers, and more preferably do not extend beyond or substantially the front face of the protective bumpers, if provided. The overmold of drawer handles that do extend beyond or substantially beyond the front surface of the drawers or front faces of the protective bumpers advantageously provides an impact absorbing surface to reduce damage to the service cart or other object if the drawer handle strikes another object. Additional embodiments of the drawer handles may define alternative structures or features.",
        "To manufacture the service cart of the illustrated embodiment, the storage compartment is fabricated and mounted to the generally box-like frame. Alternatively, the storage compartment may be fabricated to define the frame, such that the vertical corners of the storage compartment define the vertical corners of the service cart. The storage compartment advantageously is fabricated to include shelves, drawers, lids, and/or the like as required. A plurality of wheels is joined to the bottom portion of the frame or storage compartment so that the service cart is transportable. The protective bumpers are attached to the vertical corners of the service cart, advantageously by fasteners, adhesives, or the like as described above. The protective bumpers extend vertically along at least a substantial portion of the height of the service cart and may define indicia.",
        "For the embodiments of the service cart that comprise drawers with recessed handles, the drawers comprising the recesses are slidably mounted within the storage compartment before or after the handles have been attached to the recessed surfaces of the drawers. Either bar type handles or extruded handles may be attached to the drawers, and are preferably fastened to the drawers. The handles preferably define a handle depth that is not substantially greater than the combined distance of the offset depth from the recessed surface to the front surface of the drawer and the bumper depth from the front surface of the drawer to the front faces of the flanking protective bumpers, such that the handles do not extend beyond or substantially beyond the front faces of the flanking protective bumpers. More preferably, the handles define a handle depth that is not greater than or substantially greater than the offset depth such that the handles extend no further than the front surfaces of the drawers.",
        "The service cart of the present invention eliminates protruding handles while providing a bar type handle or extruded handle to open the drawers of the service cart. Such recessed bar type or extruded handles are preferred to alternative drawer handles that are less convenient to grip or to apply a pulling force to open the drawer. The lack of protruding drawer handles reduces the likelihood of the handles contacting other objects during transportation of the service cart and the amount of damage to the handles or other objects if contact does occur. The push handle advantageously comprises a protective overmold to minimize the impact between the push handle and other objects that may contact the push handle. Likewise, the protective bumpers at the corners of the storage compartment minimize the impact between the service cart and other objects that may contact the service cart, thus reducing the amount of damage to each.",
