        "The present invention also relates to finely divided aqueous suspensions of calcium carbonate which have been prepared by wet milling of calcium carbonate in the presence of these polyacrylic acids.",
        "Aqueous calcium carbonate suspensions are usually prepared by wet milling of natural calcium carbonate using polycarboxylates as milling assistants. Such calcium carbonate suspensions are used as fillers and white pigments in papermaking and in the surface coating industry. Good performance characteristics require a high degree of fineness of the milled pigment, which is to be achieved in a very short milling time. In addition, the pigment suspensions must have a good shelf-life since standing times of several days often occur between the milling process and the further processing and the suspensions must remain pumpable over this period.",
        "JP-A-2000-281959 describes the wet milling of calcium carbonate using acrylic acid homo- and copolymers which have different terminal groups and are neutralized by a base mixture. The preferred polymers have average molecular weights Mw of from 4 000 to 10 000 g/mol and are present as a mixed alkaline earth metal/alkali metal salt.",

        "The polymerization can be carried out under atmospheric, reduced or superatmospheric pressure but is preferably effected in a closed system under autogenous pressure (usually from 1 to 5 bar).",
        "In the preparation of the polyacrylic acids to be used according to the invention, it is possible to adopt a procedure in which acrylic acid and regulator in water are initially taken and are heated to the reaction temperature and the polymerization is started by adding the initiator. However, it is also possible initially to take only the regulator in water and, after heating, to add acrylic acid and initiator separately. Not least, it is also possible to add both regulator and acrylic acid and initiator, in each case separately all at once, batchwise or preferably continuously in water heated to the polymerization temperature and to effect polymerization.",

        "The calcium carbonate suspensions obtained according to the invention have excellent rheological properties and are still pumpable even after storage for 24 hours.",
        "The novel calcium carbonate suspensions are very useful as white pigments in papermaking and in surface coatings and as fillers in thermoplastics. If desired, they can be converted into powder form by various drying methods, e.g. spray drying, drum drying or paddle drying, prior to use.",

        "450 g of distilled water and 5.13 g of 50% strength by weight phosphorous acid were initially taken in a pressure-resistant reactor having a stirrer, nitrogen feed and metering apparatus and were heated to an internal temperature of 100\u00b0 C. while feeding nitrogen. Thereafter, continuously in three separate feeds, a mixture of 856.5 g of acrylic acid and 150 g of distilled water was added in 4 hours, a mixture of 8.57 g of sodium persulfate and 85.70 g of distilled water in 4.5 hours and 37 g of mercaptoethanol were added in 3.75 hours. After the end of the sodium persulfate addition, cooling was effected to 80\u00b0 C. and a mixture of 0.966 g of 2,2\u2032-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride and 31.5 g of distilled water was metered in continuously in 30 minutes. Thereafter, after stirring for a further hour at 80\u00b0 C., for neutralization, initially 381 g of 50% strength by weight sodium hydroxide solution were added in 1 hour and then a suspension of 131 g of calcium hydroxide and 301 g of water was added, likewise in 1 hour, and finally a pH of 7.3 was established by adding 301 g of 50% strength by weight sodium hydroxide solution, the temperature being kept at \u226680\u00b0 C. by cooling. Thereafter, 11.3 g of 50% strength by weight hydrogen peroxide solution were metered in at 80\u00b0 C. in 1 hour and stirring was continued for a further 2 hours.",
        "A pale brown, slightly turbid solution of a mixed calcium/sodium salt (molar ratio 70:30) of polyacrylic acid having an average molecular weight Mw of 4 500 g/mol was obtained (solids content of the solution: 45.0% by weight).",
        "B) Use of the Polyacrylic Acids Obtained",
        "In order to test the prepared polyacrylic acids as milling assistants, in each case 200 g of calcium carbonate (Marble Flour, Imerys), 76.7 g of water and 1.67 g of polyacrylic acid were initially taken in a thermostatabie 500 ml double-walled vessel. Thereafter, 473 g of glass beads (1 mm diameter) were added and stirred in with the aid of a spatula. The milling was carried out using a milling apparatus of the Dispermat AE-C type (manufacturer VMA-Getzmann) with a polyamide double grinding disk at 4 000 rpm. The milling time was 90 minutes. During the milling, the double-walled vessel was thermostated with tap water. After the milling, the slurry was filtered over a 780 \u03bcm filter with the aid of a porcelain suction filter in order to separate off the glass beads. The viscosity of the slurry was determined immediately and after 24 hours with the aid of a Brookfield viscometer DV II. In addition, the particle size of the milled calcium carbonate pigment was measured by laser diffraction using an apparatus of the Malvern Master Sizer type and was stated in percentages <2 \u03bcm.",
        "Good performance characteristics in paper coating slips are present in the case of pigment suspensions in which at least 90% of the pigment particles have a particle size of <2 \u03bcm and which are still pumpable after a storage time of 24 hours.",
        "The results of the milling experiments are listed in table 2. Where no viscosity is stated, measurement was not possible because the viscosity was too high.",
