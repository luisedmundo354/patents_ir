        "Hand-held food presses, such as a garlic press, are well known in the art and typically comprise pivotally connected upper and lower handles. The lower handle is provided with a press chamber for receiving food items, such as a garlic clove. The upper handle is provided with a press foot that is positioned to engage the press chamber and crush the garlic clove when the upper and lower handles are rotated together. The bottom of the press chamber is provided with a pattern of holes that permit fluid and particles of crushed garlic to be ejected from the chamber. Alternatively, the bottom of the press chamber may be provided with a number of parallel blades for slicing the garlic clove, instead of a pattern of holes.",
        "Users are often forced to own separate tools for crushing or slicing garlic. In addition, separate implements must also be used for cleaning food particles or other debris trapped in the holes or between the blades of the press chamber. Thus, it is desirable to have a single food press that performs multiple functions, such as a combination of crushing and slicing functions, and that has a single implement for cleaning either the holes or blades of the press chamber.",
        "These needs and other needs are satisfied by the present invention, which comprises a food press having an upper handle rotatably connected to a lower handle. First and second chambers are formed in the lower handle, and first and second feet are pivotally connected to the upper handle. When the upper and lower handles are rotated together, the first and second feet respectively engage the first and second chambers. The first chamber has a bottom with a plurality of holes forming a pattern and the second chamber has a plurality of blades. The first foot has a flat surface and the second foot has a plurality of ribs sized and shaped to be inserted between the blades in the second chamber. The ribs of the second foot extend beyond the blades of the second chamber when the upper and lower handles are rotated together.",
        "In an alternative embodiment, the upper handle has first and second ends with the first and second feet pivotally connected to the upper handle at the first end. A post is positioned on the upper handle at the second end. A cleaning piece is provided for cleaning the holes of the first chamber, the blades of the second chamber and the ribs of the second foot. The cleaning piece has an opening sized and shaped to receive the post for removably attaching the cleaning piece to the upper handle. The cleaning piece has a plurality of nubs and an edge. The nubs form a pattern corresponding to the pattern of holes in the first chamber, and are sized and shaped to fit within the holes. The edge is sized and shaped to be inserted between the blades of the second chamber and between the ribs of the second foot.",

Pins 58, 60 are respectively centered above press chamber 26 and slicer chamber 28, and press bar 54 and slicer bar 56 engage and are inserted into the press chamber and slicer chamber. Press bar 54 and slicer bar 56 are each sized and shaped to respectively fit within press chamber 26 and slicer chamber 28 and extend to the bottoms 30, 34 of each chamber when handles 12, 14 are rotated together in the closed position.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 4-6, press bar 54 has a press foot 62 with a flat surface 64 sized and shaped to correspond to the bottom 30 of press chamber 12. When a garlic clove or other food item is placed in press chamber 26 and handles 12, 14 are rotated together, the garlic clove is crushed between flat surface 64 of press foot 62 and bottom 30 of the press chamber, such that any crushed particles and extracted fluids are ejected through holes 32.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 7-9, slicer bar 56 has a slicer foot 66 with a plurality of parallel ribs 68 separated by channels 70. When upper and lower handles 12, 14 are rotated to the closed position, ribs 68 and channels 70 are sized and shaped such that blades 38 are received in the channels and the ribs are inserted between the blades. In a preferred embodiment, the height of the ribs 68 is greater than the height of blades 38, such that when handles 12, 14 are in the closed position, ends 72 of the ribs extend approximately 1 mm beyond the blades, but do not extend beyond bottom 34 of slicer chamber 28. When a garlic clove or other food item is placed in slicer chamber 28 and handles 12, 14 are rotated together, slicer foot 66 presses the garlic clove against blades 38 which cut the garlic clove into a number of slices. As blades 38 are received in channels 70, ribs 68 push the cut slices from between the blades. When handles 12, 14 are rotated to the closed position, ends 72 of ribs 68 extend beyond blades 38 to ensure that the sliced garlic and any other matter is completely ejected from the blades.",
        "In a preferred embodiment, a stop 74 is positioned in press end 20 of upper handle 12 to facilitate engagement and insertion of slicer bar 56 in slicer chamber 28. FIG. 3 shows handles 12, 14 rotated partly together with press bar 54 engaged, but not fully inserted into press chamber 26. Stop 74 is positioned adjacent slicer bar 56 and pin 60. As handles 12, 14 are rotated together toward the closed position, gravity causes slicer bar 56 to pivot on pin 60 and come to rest against stop 74, which is positioned to hold the slicer bar in alignment to engage slicer chamber 28. Thus, there is no need for the user to manually align slicer bar 56 with slicer chamber 28 when handles 12, 14 are rotated to the closed position.",
        "Food press 10 is provided with a separate cleaning piece 100 that is stored in grip end 16 of upper handle 12. As shown in FIGS. 10-12, cleaning piece 100 comprises a flat body 102 with top and bottom surfaces 104, 106. As best shown in FIGS. 10 and 12, body 102 has a tapered shape with a narrow end 108 that is used as a pick for cleaning blades 38 of slicer chamber 28 and channels 70 of slicer foot 66. Bottom surface 106 is provided with a plurality of nubs 110 that are used to clean holes 32 in the bottom 30 of press chamber 26. A handle 112 extends perpendicularly from top surface 104.",
        "The tapered shape of body 102 is generally adapted to fit within the profile of grip end 16 of upper handle 12. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, cleaning piece 100 is removably attached to grip end 16 by a post 114 that ends in a rounded knob 116. A round opening 118 is formed in body 102 that has a diameter slightly smaller than knob 116, such that the knob snap fits within the opening to hold cleaning piece 100 on post 114. A cutout 120 is formed in handle 112 adjacent opening 118, to accommodate knob 116 as it projects through the opening.",
        "As shown in FIGS. 11 and 12, a plurality of nubs 110 project perpendicularly from bottom surface 106 of body 102. Nubs 110 are sized and shaped to fit within and project through holes 32 in bottom 30 of press chamber 26, and the number and arrangement of the nubs 110 corresponds to the number and pattern of holes 32. Press chamber 26 is cleaned by placing cleaning piece 100 against the bottom 30 of the press chamber, such that nubs 110 simultaneously project through each of holes 32 to eject any trapped food particles or debris that has accumulated in the holes. In a preferred embodiment, nubs 110 are approximately 4 mm in height with rounded ends, and have a diameter that is slightly smaller than the diameter of holes 32.",
        "As best shown in FIG. 11, narrow end 108 of cleaning piece 100 has a cross-section that forms an elongated wedge-shaped edge 122. The width of narrow end 108 and thickness of edge 122 are sized to permit the narrow end to be inserted between blades 38 of slicer chamber 28 and in channels 70 between ribs 68 of slicer foot 66. In a preferred embodiment, edge 122 is approximately 10 mm in length, with a width of about 24 mm and thickness of less than 1 mm, to permit the edge to be easily inserted between blades 38 and into channels 70 for removal of any trapped food particles or debris.",
        "It is presently preferred to make food press 10 out of aluminum that is coated with a non-stick finish, which facilitates cleaning and prevents staining by various foods, such as tomato sauce. Any number of non-stick finishes may be used, such as teflon as are well known in the art. Cleaning piece 100 is preferably made of high density polyethylene. However, cleaning piece 100 may be made of various synthetic polymers and other materials that are sufficiently resilient to permit the cleaning piece to be snap fit to upper handle 12 and which are soft enough to prevent damage to the non-stick finish.",
        "It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made in the embodiments illustrated herein, without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention. Thus, the invention is not to be limited to the particular forms herein shown and described except insofar as indicated by the scope of the appended claims."
