        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an image reading device, such as an image sensor, that converts optical information to an electric signal.",
        "2. Description of the Prior Art",
        "As FIG. 3 shows, an image reading device is composed of IC chips K1, K2, . . . , Km, for reading an image, arranged in a row and mounted on a printed circuit board (not shown). The IC chips K1, K2, . . . , Km sequentially output photoelectric conversion signals, which are then converted by an A/D converter 100 into a digital signal, which is then fed out via an output terminal 200. The IC chips K1, K2, . . . , Km all have the same circuit configuration, of which a conventional example will be described below with reference to FIG. 4.",
        "Photodiodes PD1, PD2, . . . , PDn, serving as photoelectric conversion elements, have their anodes connected to ground, and have their cathodes connected respectively to the gates of p-channel MOSFETs (metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors) A1, A2, . . . , An for amplification. The transistors A1, A2, . . . , An receive, at their sources, constant currents respectively from constant-current sources I1, I2, . . . , In, and have their drains connected to ground.",
        "A bias voltage supply circuit 2 outputs a positive direct-current voltage stably. The voltage (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cbias voltage\u201d) output from the bias voltage supply circuit 2 is applied, through the drain-source channels of p-channel MOSFETs B1, B2, . . . Bn for switching, to the cathodes of the photodiodes PD1, PD2, . . . , PDn respectively.",
        "In this circuit configuration, when the transistor Bx(x=1, 2, . . . , n) remains on for a predetermined time or longer, a reverse bias is applied to the photodiode PDx, and thus a predetermined amount of electric charge is accumulated therein. In the following descriptions, this will be depicted as \u201cthe photodiode PDx being initialized.\u201d",
        "When the transistor Bx turns from on to off, the initialization of the photodiode PDx is broken off, and the accumulated electric charge is discharged in proportion to the amount of incident light, causing a current to flow. Thus, the photodiode PDx gives a voltage proportional to the amount of incident light.",
        "Moreover, a transistor Cx turns on, with the result that the voltage signal (hereinafter referred to simply as \u201cthe signal of the photodiode PDx\u201d) at the cathode of the photodiode PDx is amplified by a source-follower circuit formed by the transistor Ax, is then subjected to further amplification, waveform shaping, and other processing by an output circuit 51, and is then fed out via a terminal TOUT (hereinafter, this will be depicted as \u201cthe signal of the photodiode PDx being read out\u201d).",
        "A control circuit 52 controls the transistors Cx in such a way that the signals of the photodiodes PD1, PD2, . . . , PDn are output sequentially, and also controls the transistors Bx in such a way that the photodiode PDx is initialized every time the signal of this photodiode PD1 is read out.",
        "However, in this conventional circuit configuration, the signals of all the photodiodes PD1, PD2, . . . , PDn are transmitted to the output circuit 51 by way of a single output line L, which is thus provided so as to be common to as many as several tens to several hundred photodiodes. This makes the output line L considerably long, and thus imposes a limit on the operating frequency of the image reading device, because, the longer the conductor laid as the output line L, the higher its resistance and capacitance, and thus the greater the resulting time constant.",
        "Moreover, in the conventional circuit configuration, there are variations in the characteristics of the individual photodiodes PD1, PD2, . . . , PDn, but nevertheless the signals read out from them are fed out intact. As a result, according to the position of the photodiodes within the IC chip, for example, the characteristics of the semiconductors, such as their degree of impurity and thickness, and the light shield conditions for the individual photodiodes vary, and thus the signals that these photodiodes output vary.",
        "An object of the present invention is to provide an image reading device that is ready to operate at a higher operating frequency.",
        "To achieve the above object, according to the present invention, an image reading device is built as an IC chip having a plurality of processing sections, of which each has a plurality of image reading photoelectric conversion elements, a plurality of transistors for reading a photoelectric conversion signal from the image reading photoelectric conversion elements, a signal selection circuit for sequentially selecting the plurality of transistors, and a signal output line by way of which the photoelectric conversion signal is transmitted.",
        "This arrangement helps shorten the signal output line within each processing section. As a result, it is possible to reduce the resistance and capacitance of the conductor laid as the signal output line. Moreover, it is possible to reduce the number of transistors that are connected to a single signal output line and thereby reduce the parasitic capacitance connected to a single signal output line. This makes it possible to increase the operation speed.",
        "This and other objects and features of the present invention will become clear from the following description, taken in conjunction with the preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:",
        "FIG. 1 is a diagram showing the circuit configuration of each of the IC chips constituting an image reading device embodying the invention;",

        "Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. First, the circuit configuration of each of the IC chips constituting an image reading device embodying the invention will be described with reference to FIG. 1.",
        "Photodiodes PD1, . . . , PDn, PD1\u2032, . . . , PDn\u2032, serving as photoelectric conversion elements, have their anodes connected to ground, and have their cathodes connected respectively to the gates of p-channel MOSFETs A1, . . . , An, A1\u2032, . . . , An\u2032 for amplification.",
        "Here, the photodiodes PD1\u2032, . . . , PDn\u2032 are shielded from light so as not to be involved in image reading. In the following descriptions, these photodiodes will be referred to also as the \u201cdummy photodiodes.\u201d On the other hand, the photodiodes PD1, . . . , PDn are not shielded from light, and are used in image reading.

A logic circuit 1 controls the transistors E1, . . . , En, E1\u2032, . . . , En\u2032 in such a way that they remain on only from immediately before the start of the reading of the signal from the first image reading photodiode PD1 until the completion of the reading of the signal from the last image reading photodiode PDn.

        "The first, second, third, and fourth output line switching switches S1, S2, S3, and S4 are each composed of, for example, a p-channel MOSFET, and their on/off states are controlled by the logic circuit 1 in the manner described later.",
        "The transistors C1, . . . , Cn, C1\u2032, . . . , Cn\u2032 respectively receive, at their gates, signals output from terminals O1, . . . , On, O1\u2032, . . . , On\u2032 of the shift register 3. The sources of the transistors 4-1 and 4-2 are connected, through constant current sources 5-1 and 5-2 respectively, to ground. The drains of the transistors 4-1 and 4-2 are connected to the supply voltage.",
        "Buffer amplifiers 6-1 and 6-2 are each composed of an operational amplifier having its output fed back to its own inverting input terminal (\u2212). The input sides of the buffer amplifiers 6-1 and 6-2 (i.e. the non-inverting input terminal (+) of each operational amplifier) are connected to the sources of the transistors 4-1 and 4-2 respectively.",
        "That is, the signals of the image reading photodiodes PDx (x=1, 2, . . . , n) are fed, through the source follower circuits formed by the transistors Ax respectively, and then through the source follower circuit formed by the transistor 4-1, to the buffer amplifier 6-1. On the other hand, the signals of the dummy photodiodes PDx\u2032 are fed, through the source follower circuits formed by the transistors Ax\u2032 respectively, and then through the source follower circuit formed by the transistor 4-2, to the buffer amplifier 6-2.",
        "The output side (the output terminal of the operational amplifier) of the buffer amplifier 6-1 is connected through a resistor R1 to the inverting input terminal (\u2212) of an operational amplifier 7. The output side of the buffer amplifier 6-2 is connected through a resistor R2 to the non-inverting input terminal (+) of the operational amplifier 7.",
        "To the non-inverting input terminal (+) of the operational amplifier 7, a direct-current reference voltage is fed from outside the IC chip via a terminal TREF thereof through a resistor R3. The output terminal of the operational amplifier 7 is connected through a resistor R4 to its own inverting input terminal (\u2212), and also to the non-inverting input terminal (+) of an operational amplifier 8.",
        "To the inverting input terminal (\u2212) of the operational amplifier 8, its own output terminal is connected through a resistor R5, and also the reference voltage fed from outside via the terminal TREF is applied through a resistor R6.",
        "A buffer amplifier 9 is composed of an operational amplifier with its output fed back to its own inverting input terminal (\u2212). To the input side of the buffer amplifier 9, the output terminal of the operational amplifier 8 is connected through a capacitor 10. Moreover, the input side of the buffer amplifier 9 is connected through a switch 11 to the node between resistors R7 and R8 that are connected in series between the terminal TREF, to which the reference voltage is applied from outside, and ground.",
        "The switch 11 is composed of, for example, an analog switch, and is controlled by the logic circuit 1 in such a way as to remain on only for a predetermined time before the start of the reading of the first image reading photodiode PD1.",
        "The output of the buffer amplifier 9 is fed out through a switch 12 via a terminal TOUT of the IC chip. The switch 12 is composed of, for example, an analog switch, and is controlled by the logic circuit 1 in such a way as to remain on only from immediately before the start of the reading of the signal from the first image reading photodiode PD1 until the completion of the reading of the signal from the last image reading photodiode PDn.",
        "The logic circuit 1 receives a clock signal CLK fed in from outside via a terminal TCLK of the IC chip and a start trigger signal ST fed in from outside via a terminal TSI of the IC chip. The clock signal CLK fed to the individual IC chips are common to all of them. On the basis of the clock signal CLK and the start trigger signal ST fed thereto, the logic circuit 1 controls the transistors Ex and the switches 11 and 12 in the manner described above.",
        "Moreover, before the start of the reading of the signal from the first image reading photodiode PD1, i.e. before time point t3 shown in FIG. 2 described later, the logic circuit 1 turns on the first output line switching switch S1, turns off the second output line switching switch S2, turns on the third output line switching switch S3, and turns off the fourth output line switching switch S4. Furthermore, in the last half of the period in which the signal from the photodiode PDk is read, i.e. between time points t2k+2 and t2k+3 shown in FIG. 2 described later, the logic circuit 1 turns off the first output line switching switch S1, turns on the second output line switching switch S2, turns off the third output line switching switch S3, and turns on the fourth output line switching switch S4.",
        "The start trigger signal ST, fed in via the terminal TSI of the IC chip, and the clock signal CLK, fed in via the terminal TCLK of the IC chip, are also fed through the logic circuit 1 to the shift register 3. As FIG. 2 shows, the shift register 3 sequentially outputs, in synchronism with the second and following trailing edges of the clock signal CLK after the rising edge of the start trigger signal ST, negative pulses, each having a pulse width equal to one period of the clock signal CLK, via its terminals O1, O2, . . . . On. The shift register 3 outputs the same signals as it outputs via its terminals O1, O1, . . . , On also via its terminals O1\u2032, O2\u2032, . . . , On\u2032.",
        "As a result, the transistors C1 and C1\u2032, the transistors C2 and C2\u2032, . . . , the transistors Cn and Cn\u2032 are sequentially kept on for one period of the clock signal CLK one pair after another, specifically in such a way that the transistors C1 and C1\u2032 remain on between time points t3 and t5, the transistors C2 and C2\u2032 remain on between time points t5 and t7, and so forth. Thus, the signals of the image reading photodiodes PD1, PD2, . . . , PDn are sequentially fed to the gate of the transistor 4-1, and the signals of the dummy photodiodes PD1\u2032, PD2\u2032, . . . , PDn\u2032 are sequentially fed to the gate of the transistor 4-2.",
        "Moreover, as FIG. 2 shows, the shift register 3 also sequentially outputs, in synchronism with the third and following rising edges of the clock signal CLK after the rising edge of the start trigger signal ST, negative pulses, each having a pulse width equal to one period of the clock signal CLK, via its terminals M1, M2, . . . , Mn.",
        "As a result, the transistors B1, B2, . . . , Bn are sequentially kept on for one period of the clock signal CLK one after another, specifically in such a way that the transistor B1 remains on between time points t4 and t6, the transistor B2 remains on between time points t6 and t8, and so forth. Thus, the image reading photodiodes PD1, PD2, . . . , PDn are initialized sequentially.",
        "In this way, if one pays attention to the first image reading photodiode PD1, whereas the transistor C1 is kept on between time points t3 and t5 so that the signal of the photodiode PD1 is read out, the transistor B1 is also kept on between time points t4 and t5 (i.e. during the last half of the read period) so that the photodiode PD1 is initialized. Thus, only the signal read out between time points t3 and t4 (i.e. during the first half of the read period) is actually used. Likewise, also with the other image reading photodiodes PD2, PD3, . . . , PDn, only the signals read out during the first half of their respective read period are actually used.",
        "Moreover, as FIG. 2 shows, the shift register 3 also sequentially outputs, in synchronism with the trailing edges of the clock signal CLK after the rising edge of the start trigger signal ST, negative pulses, each having a pulse width equal to one period of the clock signal CLK, via its terminals M1\u2032, M2\u2032, . . . , Mn\u2032.",
        "As a result, the transistors B1\u2032, B2\u2032, . . . , Bn\u2032 are sequentially kept on for one period of the clock signal CLK one after another, specifically in such a way that the transistor B1\u2032 remains on between time points t1 and t3, the transistor B2\u2032 remains on between time points t3 and t5, and so forth. Thus, the dummy photodiodes PD1\u2032, PD2\u2032, . . . , PDn\u2032 are initialized sequentially.",
        "Moreover, the shift register 3 outputs, at its terminal E, a signal, which is fed out of the IC chip via its terminal TSO so as to be fed to the terminal TSI of the next IC chip. That is, this signal is used as the start trigger signal ST in the next IC chip. Here, the shift register 3 outputs one positive pulse via its terminal E with such appropriate timing as to prevent interference between the reading of the signal of the last image reading photodiode PDn of the IC chip under discussion and the reading of the signal of the first image reading photodiode PD1 of the next IC chip.",
        "In this circuit configuration, the differences between the signals of the image reading photodiodes PDx and the signals of the corresponding dummy photodiodes PDx\u2032 are output. Thus, even if there are variations among the output signals from the individual photodiodes within an IC chip according to their position, for example, due to variations in the characteristics of the semiconductors, such as their degree of impurity and thickness, and variations in the light shield conditions of the individual photodiodes, such variations are cancelled. This helps enhance the uniformity of the signal levels obtained.",
        "Moreover, instead of transmitting all the signals from the individual image reading photodiodes PD1, . . . , PDn to the output circuit H by way of a single output line, the signals from the group of the image reading photodiode PD1, . . . , PDk are transmitted by way of the first output line L1, and the signals from the group of the image reading photodiode PDk+1, . . . , PDn are transmitted by way of the first output line L2. Likewise, instead of transmitting all the signals from the dummy photodiodes PD1\u2032, . . . , PDn\u2032 to the output circuit H by way of a single output line, the signals from the group of the dummy photodiode PD1\u2032, . . . , PDk\u2032 are transmitted by way of the third output line L3, and the signals from the group of the dummy photodiode PDk+1\u2032, . . . , PDn\u2032 are transmitted by way of the fourth output line L4. This makes it possible to shorten the output line substantially in half. Shortening the conductor laid as the output line results in reducing its resistance and capacitance, and also in reducing the parasitic capacitance due to the transistors connected thereto in half. This reduces the resulting time constant, and thus makes it possible to increase the operating frequency of the image reading device. Specifically, whereas the operating frequency conventionally achieved is limited to 1.5 to 2.0 MHz, that achieved in this embodiment is as high as 3.0 to 4.0 MHz.",
        "Where, as in the embodiment described above, the image reading photodiodes are divided into two groups, they are classified, for example, according to whether the signals from them are read out in the first half or latter half of the period for reading one complete image. The image reading photodiodes may be divided into a plurality of groups, i.e. not only two but also three or more; in any case, output lines are provided one for each group.",
        "It is possible to omit the dummy photodiodes completely, or provide only one dummy photodiode common to all the image reading photodiodes and output the differences between the signals of the individual image reading photodiodes and the signal of the dummy photodiode. This helps simplify the circuit configuration, and thus contributes to miniaturization and cost reduction.",
        "Providing as many dummy photodiodes as image reading photodiodes, however, makes it possible to arrange the dummy photodiodes close to the corresponding image reading photodiodes. Thus, in this arrangement, outputting the differences between the signals of the image reading photodiodes and the signals of the dummy photodiodes arranged close thereto makes it possible to reduce variations among the output signals from the individual photodiodes within an IC chip according to their position, for example, due to variations in the characteristics of the semiconductors, such as their degree of impurity and thickness, and variations in the light shield conditions of the individual photodiodes.",
        "As described above, according to the present invention, in an image reading device, it is possible to shorten the output line by way of which signals obtained from photoelectric conversion elements are transmitted to an output circuit, and also reduce the number of transistors connected to one output line. That is, it is possible to reduce the resistance and capacitance of the conductor laid as the output line. This reduces the parasitic capacitance due to the transistors connected to the output line, and thereby reduces the resulting time constant. In this way, it is possible to increase the operating frequency of the image reading device and obtain outputs corrected for variations in the characteristics of photodiodes."
