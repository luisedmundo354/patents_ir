        "The present application is a divisional of and claims priority from U. S. application Ser. No. 10/304,272, filed Nov. 26, 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,956,239, entitled \u201cTRANSISTORS HAVING BURIED P-TYPE LAYERS BENEATH THE SOURCE REGION,\u201d which is assigned to the assignee of the present application, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference as if set forth fully.",
        "The present invention was made, at least in part, with support from the Department of the Navy, contract number N39997-99-C-3761. The Government may have certain rights in this invention.",
        "The present invention relates to microelectronic devices and more particularly to transistors, for example, metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs).",
        "Electrical circuits requiring high power handling capability (>20 watts) while operating at high frequencies such as radio frequencies (500 MHz), S-band (3 GHz) and X-band (10 GHz) have in recent years become more prevalent. Because of the increase in high power, high frequency circuits there has been a corresponding increase in demand for transistors that are capable of reliably operating at radio frequencies and above while still being capable of handling higher power loads. Previously, bipolar transistors and power metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) have been used for high power applications but the power handling capability of such devices may be limited at higher operating frequencies. Junction field-effect transistors (JFETs) were commonly used for high frequency applications but the power handling capability of previously known JFETs may also be limited.",
        "Recently, metal-semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs) have been developed for high frequency applications. The MESFET construction may be preferable for high frequency applications because only majority carriers carry current. The MESFET design may be preferred over current MOSFET designs because the reduced gate capacitance permits faster switching times of the gate input. Therefore, although all field-effect transistors utilize only majority carriers to carry current, the Schottky gate structure of the MESFET may make the MESFET more desirable for high frequency applications.",
        "In addition to the type of structure, and perhaps more fundamentally, the characteristics of the semiconductor material from which a transistor is formed also affects the operating parameters. Of the characteristics that affect a transistor's operating parameters, the electron mobility, saturated electron drift velocity, electric breakdown field and thermal conductivity may have the greatest effect on a transistor's high frequency and high power characteristics.",
        "Electron mobility is the measurement of how rapidly an electron is accelerated to its saturated velocity in the presence of an electric field. In the past, semiconductor materials which have a high electron mobility were preferred because more current could be developed with a lesser field, resulting in faster response times when a field is applied. Saturated electron drift velocity is the maximum velocity that an electron can obtain in the semiconductor material. Materials with higher saturated electron drift velocities are preferred for high frequency applications because the higher velocity translates to shorter times from source to drain.",
        "Electric breakdown field is the field strength at which breakdown of the Schottky junction and the current through the gate of the device suddenly increases. A high electric breakdown field material is preferred for high power, high frequency transistors because larger electric fields generally can be supported by a given dimension of material. Larger electric fields allow for faster transients as the electrons can be accelerated more quickly by larger electric fields than by smaller.",
        "Thermal conductivity is the ability of the semiconductor material to dissipate heat. In typical operations, all transistors generate heat. In turn, high power and high frequency transistors usually generate larger amounts of heat than small signal transistors. As the temperature of the semiconductor material increases, the junction leakage currents generally increase and the current through the field effect transistor generally decreases due to a decrease in carrier mobility with an increase in temperature. Therefore, if the heat is dissipated from the semiconductor, the material will remain at a lower temperature and be capable of carrying larger currents with lower leakage currents.",
        "In the past, high frequency MESFETs have been manufactured of n-type III-V compounds, such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) because of their high electron mobilities. Although these devices provided increased operating frequencies and moderately increased power handling capability, the relatively low breakdown voltage and the lower thermal conductivity of these materials have limited their usefulness in high power applications.",
        "Silicon carbide (SiC) has been known for many years to have excellent physical and electronic properties which should theoretically allow production of electronic devices that can operate at higher temperatures, higher power and higher frequency than devices produced from silicon (Si) or GaAs. The high electric breakdown field of about 4\u00d7106 V/cm, high saturated electron drift velocity of about 2.0\u00d7107 cm/sec and high thermal conductivity of about 4.9 W/cm-\u00b0 K. indicate that SiC would be suitable for high frequency, high power applications. Unfortunately, difficulty in manufacturing has limited the usefulness of SiC for high power and high frequency applications.",
        "MESFETs have been produced having channel layers of silicon carbide have been produced on silicon substrates (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,762,806 to Suzuki et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,028 to Kondoh et al.). Because the semiconductor layers of a MESFET are epitaxial, the layer upon which each epitaxial layer is grown affects the characteristics of the device. Thus, a SiC epitaxial layer grown on a Si substrate generally has different electrical and thermal characteristics then a SiC epitaxial layer grown on a different substrate. Although the SiC on Si substrate devices described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,762,806 and 4,757,028 may have exhibited improved thermal characteristics, the use of a Si substrate generally limits the ability of such devices to dissipate heat. Furthermore, the growth of SiC on Si generally results in defects in the epitaxial layers that result in high leakage current when the device is in operation.",
        "Other MESFETs have been developed using SiC substrates. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/540,488 filed Jun. 19, 1990 and now abandoned, the disclosure of which is incorporated entirely herein by reference, describes a SiC MESFET having epitaxial layers of SiC grown on a SiC substrate. These devices exhibited improved thermal characteristics over previous devices because of the improved crystal quality of the epitaxial layers grown on SiC substrates. However, to obtain high power and high frequency it may be necessary to overcome the limitations of SiC's lower electron mobility.",
        "Similarly, commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,554 to Palmour describes a SiC MESFET having source and drain contacts formed on n+ regions of SiC and an optional lightly doped epitaxial layer between the substrate and the n-type layer in which the channel is formed. U.S. Pat. No. 5,925,895 to Sriram et al. also describes a SiC MESFET and a structure that is described as overcoming \u201csurface effects\u201d which may reduce the performance of the MESFET for high frequency operation. Sriram et al. also describes SiC MESFETs which use n+ source and drain contact regions as well as a p-type buffer layer.",
        "Furthermore, conventional SiC FET structures may provide the constant characteristics during the entire operating range of the FET, i.e. from fully open channel to near pinch-off voltage, by using a very thin, highly doped channel (a delta doped channel) offset from the gate by a lightly doped region of similar conductivity type. Delta doped channels are discussed in detail in an article by Yokogawa et al. entitled Electronic Properties of Nitrogen Delta-Doped Silicon Carbide Layers, MRS Fall Symposium, 2000 and an article by Konstantinov et al. entitled Investigation of Lo-Hi-Lo and Delta Doped Silicon Carbide Structure, MRS Fall Symposium, 2000. However, further improvements may be made in SiC MESFETs.",
        "For example, it may be important that SiC MESFETs have high breakdown voltages and relatively low leakage currents if they are used in high efficiency, high power, high linearity radio frequency (RF) applications. In an attempt to provide high breakdown voltages, devices have been provided having highly compensated substrates, such as Vanadium doped semi-insulating SiC. These devices typically provide adequate breakdown voltages as well as low leakage currents, but may sacrifice device performance due to unwanted trapping effects in the substrate. Furthermore, devices having highly doped p-type layers under the channel of the FET have been provided and have been successful in providing good electron confinement and low leakage currents. However, these devices generally contain excessive parasitics that may degrade the RF performance of the device. Accordingly, further improvements may be made with respect to existing SiC FET devices such that they may provide improved breakdown voltages without sacrificing other performance characteristics of the device.",
        "Embodiments of the present invention provide a unit cell of a metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MESFET). The unit cell of the MESFET includes a MESFET having a source, a drain and a gate. The gate is disposed between the source and the drain and on an n-type conductivity channel layer. A p-type conductivity region is provided beneath the source and has an end that extends towards the drain. The p-type conductivity region is spaced apart from the n-type conductivity channel layer and is electrically coupled to the source.",
        "In some embodiments of the present invention, the gate may extend into the n-type conductivity channel layer. The gate may have a first sidewall and a second sidewall. The first sidewall of the gate may be associated with the source side of the gate and the second sidewall may be associated with the drain side of the gate. The p-type conductivity region may extend from beneath the source to the first sidewall of the gate without extending past the first sidewall of the gate, from beneath the source to the second sidewall of the gate without extending past the second sidewall of the gate or from beneath the source to between the first and second sidewalls of the gate. In some embodiments, the p-type conductivity region extends from beneath the source to within about 0.1 to about 0.3 \u03bcm of the first sidewall on the source side of the first sidewall. In certain embodiments, the p-type conductivity region extends from beneath a source contact and/or a source implant region without extending to beneath a drain contact. The p-type conductivity region may also extend from beneath a source contact and/or a source implant region without extending to beneath a drain implant region.",
        "In further embodiments of the present invention, the MESFET is a silicon carbide (SiC) MESFET having a SiC substrate. The p-type conductivity region may be disposed on the SiC substrate. In some embodiments, the p-type conductivity region is in the SiC substrate. The n-type conductivity channel layer may include n-type conductivity SiC and the p-type conductivity region may include p-type conductivity SiC.",
        "In still further embodiments of the present invention, the p-type conductivity region may have a carrier concentration of from about 1.0\u00d71018 cm\u22123 to about 1.0\u00d71020 cm\u22123. The n-type conductivity channel layer may include a first n-type conductivity channel layer and a second n-type conductivity channel layer. The first n-type conductivity channel layer may have a carrier concentration of about 3\u00d71017 cm\u22123 and the second n-type conductivity channel layer may have a carrier concentration of about 1\u00d71016 cm\u22123. The first n-type conductivity channel layer may have a thickness of about 0.28 \u03bcm and the second n-type conductivity channel layer may have a thickness of about 900 \u212b. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the n-type conductivity channel layer includes first, second and third n-type conductivity channel layers. The first, second and third n-type conductivity channel layers may have respective first, second and third carrier concentrations.",
        "In some embodiments of the present invention, the MESFET may further include a buffer layer on a SiC substrate. The p-type conductivity region may be formed in the buffer layer.

No. 6,218,680 to Carter et al. entitled \u201cSemi-insulating Silicon Carbide Without Vanadium Domination\u201d, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein as if set forth in its entirety. Such a semi-insulating substrate may be produced by providing silicon carbide substrates with sufficiently high levels of point defects and sufficiently matched levels of p-type and n-type dopants such that the resistivity of the silicon carbide substrate is dominated by the point defects. Such a domination may be accomplished by fabricating the silicon carbide substrate at elevated temperatures with source powders that have concentrations of heavy metals, transition elements or other deep level trapping elements of less than about 1\u00d71016 cm\u22123 and preferably less than about 1.0\u00d71014 cm\u22123.

Thus, it is preferred that the semi-insulating substrate be substantially free of heavy metal, transition element dopants or other deep level trapping elements, such as vanadium, such that the resistivity of the substrate is not dominated by such heavy metals or transition elements. While it is preferred that the semi-insulating substrate be free of such heavy metal, transition element dopants or deep level trapping elements, such elements may be present in measurable amounts while still benefiting from the teachings of the present invention if the presence of such materials does not substantially affect the electrical properties of the MESFETs described herein.",

The ion implantation may be performed on the regions that are not covered by the mask 45 to form p+ region 14 as illustrated in FIG. 2B. Thus, the ions are implanted in portions of the buffer layer 12, if present, or the substrate 10, to provide a highly doped region of p-type conductivity, for example, p-type conductivity silicon carbide. Once implanted, the dopants are annealed to activate the implant. The highly doped region of p-type conductivity may extend about 0.4 \u03bcm into the buffer layer 12 or the substrate 10.",

The first recess 43 may be formed by an etching process, such as a dry or wet etch process. For example, the first recess 43 may be formed by dry etching, for example, Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) or Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) etching. The mask 47 may be removed.",

The insulator layer 20 may be grown or deposited over the exposed surface of the existing structure, i.e. on the isolation mesa, n+ regions 13 and 17, the n-type conductivity channel layer 18 and in the first recess 43. The oxidation process may remove, for example, SiC that may have been damaged by the etch process and may also smooth out roughness that may have been created on the surface by the etch.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 2F, contact windows may be etched through the insulator layer 20 to the n+ regions 13 and 17. A third contact window 41 may be etched in the insulator layer 20 above the highly doped p+ region 14. Nickel may then be evaporated to deposit the source and drain contacts 26 and 22, respectively. The nickel may be annealed to form the ohmic contacts 26 and 22 as illustrated in FIG. 2F. Such a deposition and annealing process may be carried out utilizing conventional techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, the ohmic contacts 26 and 22 may be annealed at a temperature of from about 950\u00b0 C. to about 1100\u00b0 C. for about 2 minutes. However, other times and temperatures may also be utilized. Times from about 30 seconds to about 10 minutes may be, for example, acceptable.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 2G, a contact via hole 42 of the MESFET may be formed. The contact via hole 42 may be etched in the portion of the MESFET defined by window 41 in the insulator layer 20. The n-type conductivity channel layer 18 and the second buffer layer 16 may be etched through to expose the p+ conductivity region 14 to form the contact via hole 42. The etching process may be, for example, a dry or wet etch process. As further illustrated in FIG. 2G, nickel may be evaporated to deposit the p+ contact 25. The nickel may be annealed to form the ohmic contact 25. Such a deposition and annealing process may be carried out utilizing conventional techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, the ohmic contact 25 may be annealed at a temperature of from about 600\u00b0 C. to about 1050\u00b0 C.",
        "FIG. 2H illustrates the formation of the gate contact 24 and the overlayers 28, 30 and 32. For example, a window may be opened in the insulator 20 and a layer of chromium may be deposited in the first recess 43. Typically, the chromium layer is formed by evaporative deposition. The gate structure may then be completed by deposition of platinum and gold. As will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the overlayers 28 and 30 may be formed either before or after formation of the gate structure. In fact, if the titanium/platinum/gold structure is utilized, the platinum and gold portions of the overlayer may be formed in the same processing steps as the platinum and gold portions 32 of the gate structure. Accordingly, the overlayers 28 and 30 may be formed prior to the formation of a gate contact or after the formation of a gate contact. As further illustrated, the source contact 26 and the p+ contact share a single overlayer 28, which electrically couples the source to the highly doped p-type conductivity region 14. Alternatively, as discussed above the first recess 43 may be a double recess structure and the gate may be disposed within the double recessed structure.",
