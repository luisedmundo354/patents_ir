        "The present invention relates generally to network based security systems, and more particularly relates to a web services security system that utilizes an XML security schema.",
        "2. Related Art",
        "One of the primary benefits of distributed networks such as the Internet is the ability to readily share information to many people across many different computing environments. However, a critical challenge faced by many organizations involves providing security within such a distributed environment. The challenge becomes even more pronounced for organizations that wish to implement complex security structures, where for instance very specific pieces of data must be made available to different sets of users across distributed and heterogeneous computing environments.",
        "Multi-level, multi-user security in a web services environment that can carry multi-dimensional access tokens to row level data (data physically located at its lowest abstraction such as in a row on a relational database) has not been successfully addressed in highly secure, highly distributed computing environments. Most current \u201ccommercial of the shelf\u201d (COTS) products act as gatekeepers for localized directory structures, and/or coarse user authentication, or are monolithic in their application of common COTS products to achieve multi-level multi-user security for more fine grain access and authentication control. They do not easily allow for data items to be secured at different levels and across heterogeneous security domains. Accordingly, providing very fine grain authorization access to highly secure data within and across disparate organizations that are utilizing web services has been an extremely difficult problem to solve.",
        "The difficulty of solving this issue, the newness of the underlying technologies driving web services, and the evolution of commercial off the shelf security products, combined with the need in many circumstances to rapidly deploy a suitable security technique has given rise to a need for a more complete data security solution.",
        "The present invention addresses the above-mentioned problems, as well as others, by providing a security architecture that includes an XML based security schema that provides a security authorization solution allowing granular access to data in a distributed heterogeneous computing environment. In a first aspect, the invention provides a security architecture for granting multi-level access to data items in a distributed network, comprising: an authentication server that provides access to a web portal using a web services based communication framework; a system for securely establishing security credentials for an end user logging into the authentication server system; an access directory that obtains the security credentials for the end user from the authentication server, generates a set of XML credential data based on a predefined XML schema, and returns the XML credential data to the authentication server; and wherein the authentication server passes the XML credential data to the web portal in order to grant access to the end user for data items accessible via the web portal.",
        "In a second aspect, the invention provides a method for granting multi-level access to data items in a distributed network, comprising: providing an authentication server that can communicate with a web portal using a web services based framework; establishing security credentials for an end user while logging into the authentication server; converting the security credentials to a set of XML security data based on a predefined XML security schema; passing the XML security data from the authentication server to the web portal; and granting access to data items accessible via the web portal based on the XML security data.",
        "In a third aspect, the invention provides a system for providing multi-level access to data items in a distributed network, comprising: a web portal for providing access to data items, wherein each data item is tagged with at least one identifier that dictates access to the data item based upon a predefined set of schema constructs; and an authentication system for logging users into the web portal, wherein the authentication system is in communication with the web portal via a web services based communication framework, and wherein the authentication system includes: a system for generating a set of XML credential data during a user login based on a predefined XML schema; and a system for passing the set of XML credential data to the web portal to determine access to tagged data items for the user.",
        "Accordingly, the invention comprises a security technique that utilizes a web services architecture, along with a defined XML schema, to provide coarse level security across heterogeneous computing domains. The schema supports a core framework for building scalar security schemas quickly based on common security access criteria for a community of interested parties in the shared common data, i.e., an interest community. The schema provides a fast start mechanism and vernacular to talk to distributed heterogeneous security domains that can be utilized within the context of the applied security access technique described herein.",
        "Furthermore, multi-level security tagging of data is provided, and is accessed with tokens (or caveats) that dictate a user's level of authorization for accessing granular data. Accordingly, an overarching \u201cne plus ultra\u201d authority is required as a logical business entity across domains that can validate user caveats from different domains, and issue coarse security authentication.",
        "These and other features of this invention will be more readily understood from the following detailed description of the various aspects of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:",
        "FIG. 1 depicts an architectural overview of a security system in accordance with the present invention.",
        "FIGS. 2-17 graphically depict an XML security schema in accordance with the present invention.",
        "FIG. 18 depicts a graphical view of the combined hierarchy of the schema.",
        "Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 depicts an architecture 10 of a web services based security environment that allows users 12 to access secure data 20 located at disparate locations on a distributed network, such as the World Wide Web (web). More specifically, access to secure data 20 is provided via a login process to an authentication server system 16 using client browser 14. Client browser 14 provides access to at least one portal web site 18 utilizing, e.g., a standard http URL, and also provides information to a registration authority 22 that implements a logical domain specific process for user registration, initial processing, etc. In some domains, this process is manifested as a capture of pertinent user information and details. While the particular implementation of this process is not at issue, the existence of some logical domain specific process is required to build a set of security credentials 32.",
        "Security credentials 32 determine which specific sets of data each user shall be granted access to. Examples may include, e.g., predefined levels of authority, community memberships, etc. It should be understood that the elements, types, categories and overall framework of the security credentials 32 are not limited, and will generally depend on the type of application being implemented. However, the utilization of the disclosed schema will address a large percentage of potential cross-domain security environments, serving as a \u201cfast start\u201d schema implementation and technique. For instance, in a typical corporate environment, a user may have manager level privileges and belong to a human resources community and a marketing community. In a government application, the user may have top-secret privileges and be granted access to navy, DARPA, and weapons of mass destruction communities.",
        "As noted above, security credentials 32 for the user can be established and verified using known techniques with registration authority 22 and certificate authority 24. A registration authority (RA) 22 is an authority in a network that verifies user requests for a digital certificate and tells the certificate authority (CA) 24 to issue it. RAs are part of a public key infrastructure (PKI), a networked system that enables companies and users to exchange information safely and securely. The digital certificate contains a public key that is used to encrypt and decrypt messages and digital signatures.",
        "A certificate authority (CA) 24 is an authority in a network that issues and manages security credentials and public keys for message encryption. As part of a public key infrastructure (PKI), a CA checks with a registration authority (RA) to verify information provided by the requestor of a digital certificate. If the RA verifies the requestor's information, the CA can then issue a certificate. Depending on the public key infrastructure implementation, the certificate includes the owner's public key, the expiration date of the certificate, the owner's name, and other information about the public key owner. In this case, the certificate authority 24 would store the security credentials 32 for each user in credential database 25, and issue a certificate that included security credentials 32 for the particular user when the user logs in.",
        "This technique can utilize a variety of simple administration components to allow credential inputs and design by the business operation of the registration authority 22, such as a Java interface to assist in building and administering user credentials at this level.",
        "During login, authentication server system 16 acts as a reverse proxy to obtain the security credentials 32 via a proxy certificate. In addition to providing log in capabilities, authentication server system 16 provides an engine to assist in directory abstraction of required or requested files that reside on a specific server machine in a directory structure a user would need to access in order to perform some unit of work, search or data acquisition. These files may exist in disparate physical and logical locations, and are generally shown as secure data 20. Supporting the authentication server system 16 is a security manager 36 that validates the \u201clogging\u201d user and builds the security credentials 32. It is here where the actual security credentials 32 are built and verified with the certificate authority 24. Security manager also supports revocation checking, and mapping Public Key credentials to access permissions, ultimately passing this back to the authentication server system 16.",
        "Authentication server system 16 provides the composite, validated credential for user access to a web portal 18, which can take any form, such as YAHOO!\u00ae or a proprietary portal, using a web services based framework 17. This model can support multiple domain portal instances, with their associated data since it serves as the overarching security framework for distributed systems. Web services ensures that communications are described in some structured manner. Specifically, in this case, an XML grammar or schema is provided in this invention for describing and automating the communication of a user's security credentials 32 to the web portal 18.",
        "In this exemplary embodiment, the SOAP protocol is utilized. SOAP is a lightweight protocol intended for exchanging structured information in a decentralized, distributed environment. SOAP uses XML technologies to define an extensible messaging framework, which provides a message construct that can be exchanged over a variety of underlying protocols. The framework has been designed to be independent of any particular programming model and other implementation specific semantics. Thus, SOAP allows XML messages to be easily moved to the web portal. Accordingly, using SOAP, or a similar protocol, an XML based communications environment 19 between authentication server system 16 and web portal 18 is provided.",
        "Access to the secure data 20 within this environment is implemented by utilizing an access directory 26 that obtains the security credentials 32 for the user and generates XML credential data 34 that includes: (1) security profile information including a set of XML tokens (i.e., caveats), and (2) community of interest \u201cCOI\u201d information. The tokens and COI information, which are passed to the web portal 18, dictate which data items the end-user will have authorized access to. XML credential data 34 is generated by the access directory 26 based on an XML security schema 28. The XML security schema 28 is parsed for the validation of the user, as well as construction of the security credentials 32.",

        "As can be seen, the XML credential data includes: user profile information (e.g., name, address, etc.); security profile that includes a level and caveats; community of interest profile information that includes one or more communities (e.g., DARPA, FBI, Central Asia COI, WMD COI); interest profile information that includes various topics of interests (e.g., Karachi Airport, Counter Narcotics, etc).",
        "Caveats in the context of the XML Security schema 28 represent the application of multi-level user security credentials. Caveats function in relation to the element \u201clevels\u201d in that caveats represent finer grain details of security levels in a multi-level security schema. It is important to recognize that the invention provides the ability for disparate organizations to maintain control of their local and unique users and data, and still share critical information with others, which is a well understood and recognized concept for optimized synergistic operation within an unlimited category of domain types, including commercial industries or governmental entities. However the quandary solved by this invention is the ability to classify users and data in a very simple and straightforward way so that native domain data can be securely compartmentalized for internal users, yet marked for sharing outside the organizational boundary with other alien (with respect to the data) organizations. The solution includes the technique and application of two level (or two tier) caveats.",
        "It must be pointed out that the ability within the domain to tag user, data and/or metadata levels with the two-tier caveat is important to this technique. The assumption is that a cross-domain governance authority and business rules exist at the Registration Authority level to assure that inter-domain caveat ontology is taxonomically applied across domains. There are a variety of business and technical implementation methodologies that can use this technique, with the most obvious being association to relational data constructs as keys or allied tagging within a relational data construct as one of many low level associations for anyone familiar with the art.",
        "Thus, the ability to apply relatively simple constructs such as masking against data to user credential so that users can always access the appropriate data for their security level can be view by the following construct:\n\n(metadata.class<=user.class)",
        "Such an artifice is exquisitely applied within the context of a relational query against caveats.",
        "Caveats contain two subcategories for the users' security compartment and the releasability level of the topic data, which in the following \u201cWMD COI\u201d illustration showing an exemplar schema, are indicated as caveats C1, C2, and C3. This could for instance, represent domain user security levels of Unclassified for C1, Secret for C2 and Top Secret for C3. The releasability caveat levels R1, R2, and R3 represent the domain qualifiers that can place restrictions on users and data that can review the information outside the home domain. For example, native information is contained within Enterprise X, and is unclassified, and has caveat C1, R1 applied. Business rules in place in this inter-domain scenario dictate that all users of that enterprise can review this information. However the data caveat R2 imposed by Enterprise X, restricts Enterprise Y from obtaining this information. Thus, the interpretation in this example would be that the information is only available to the home Enterprise X, and not available to be shared with any other domain.",

        "areaOfInterest\nWith children Lower Left and Upper Right represent a\n\n\n\ngeospatial orientation reference for any data or meta data the\n\n\n\nuser has access to. This is used by the element \u201citem\u201d.\n\n\n\nbusinessServices - With child service in an unbounded one\n\n\n\nservice to many potential representative services the user can\n\n\n\naccess and is utilized by the element \u201crole\u201d\n\n\ncaveat\nUsed by the element \u201ccaveats\u201d and has enumeration facets that\n\n\n\nform the containers for the users security constraints as\n\n\n\ndescribed by the domain. For example assume a DoD user\n\n\n\nwho has security access TS/SCI assigned by the governance\n\n\n\nauthority that describes and confirms the credentials that are\n\n\n\noperationally originated by domain business rules and\n\n\n\nprocesses, then confirmed and passed to the Registration\n\n\n\nAuthority. Once the confirmation of credentials is made, the\n\n\n\ntechnical means to begin the construction and transportation of\n\n\n\nthose credentials is started. In this example caveats would\n\n\n\nhave enumerations for this user representing the security\n\n\n\ncompartments, Special Compartmentalized Information (SCI)\n\n\n\nand occupying an enumerations defined by business rules,\n\n\n\ngovernance and inhabiting C1, C2, or C3. FIGS. 2\u201317\n\n\n\npresents these enumerations as a six level construct C1, C2,\n\n\n\nC3, for the compartment overlays of the user. The R1, R2, R3\n\n\n\nare enumerations for matching to the releasability of data\n\n\n\nnoting that these definitions must be made according to the\n\n\n\ndomain based in business rules and applicable across domains.\n\n\n\nThis claim makes no assumptions as to the plethora of\n\n\n\npotential enumerations however does claim the construct of a\n\n\n\nsecurity caveat enumeration and compartment and\n\n\n\nreleasability constructs within the schema as the finest grain\n\n\n\nsecurity component thus forming cross domain web service\n\n\n\nbased multi-user multi-level security. During registration the\n\n\n\nuser would provide an access request and then upon\n\n\n\nconfirmation by the Registration Authority these would then\n\n\n\naccompany the encapsulated security access descriptors.\n\n\n\nAdditionally this requires the domain(s) to tag releasability\n\n\n\nlevels to the information. While the enumerations can change\n\n\n\nas to specification, the important constructs are the caveat, its\n\n\n\ndomain specific enumerations, and the business authority to\n\n\n\nconfirm, authorize, and build those credentials within the\n\n\n\ncontext of the claimed security schema.\n\n\ncaveats\nThe child of caveat, and used by securityProfile, is the\n\n\n\nconnecting element between the higher-level construct of\n\n\n\nsecurityProfile and the lower level caveat and its fine grain\n\n\n\nenumerations.\n\n\nCity and cityOfInterest\nAre used by schema element item rolling up to interestProfile\n\n\n\nand ultimately at the top level to coiProfile which describes\n\n\n\nthe 17 top level child descriptions in the COI profile which\n\n\n\nare; securityProfile, uuid, coiName, coiType,\n\n\n\ncoiNetworkType, coiStatus, startDate, stopDate, priority,\n\n\n\nsponsor, homepage, mission, goal, objective,\n\n\n\nrelationshipProfile, sourceProfile, interestProfile.\n\n\ncoiName\nIs used by the top level coiProfile and consists of the name of\n\n\n\nthe community of interest a user is associated with. Definition\n\n\n\nof these communities of interest are made by business rules of\n\n\n\nthe governing body that works at the Registration Suthroity\n\n\n\nlevel. Associating a user in a multi-user, multi-level security\n\n\n\nservices based computing model to a community of interest is\n\n\n\na vital construct in order to support cross domain user\n\n\n\nassociation and the ability to access pertinent alien (non user\n\n\n\nhome domain specific) data that is shared among distributed\n\n\n\ndomains.\n\n\ncoiNetworkType\nIs used by the top-level coiProfile, and is a description of the\n\n\n\nusers home network. This description is vital to the ability of\n\n\n\nthe user credential to pass user home network information\n\n\n\nencapsulated in the security header. This information could be\n\n\n\nas thin as a descriptive identifier or could pass descriptive\n\n\n\ninformation within the user credential.\n\n\ncoiProfile\nIs the top level user description consisting of the 17 child\n\n\n\ndescriptions associated with a user profile consisting of the\n\n\n\nfollowing; securityProfile, uuid, coiName, coiType,\n\n\n\ncoiNetworkType, coiStatus, startDate, stopDate, priority,\n\n\n\nsponsor, homepage, mission, goal, objective,\n\n\n\nrelationshipProfile, sourceProfile, interestProfile. The\n\n\n\nconstruct that has cross-domain users associated with a\n\n\n\nminimum of one community of interest is a mandatory\n\n\n\ndimension of the security schema. Because in a cross domain,\n\n\n\nservices based computing environment it is expected that one\n\n\n\ndomain has users of a particular stratification along a common\n\n\n\ninterest, the articulation of this interest is the primary vector in\n\n\n\ntheir need for cross domain data access sharing and security\n\n\n\nconcern. Moreover because of the nature of various security\n\n\n\ninformation and levels, this could take the form of for example\n\n\n\na subcontractors interest in contract pricing levels but the\n\n\n\nprime filtering the access to only non-proprietary pricing\n\n\n\nreview items to the sub contractor.

        "A more complete graphical definition of the XML security schema 28 is shown in FIGS. 2-17. FIG. 18 depicts a graphical representation of the XML security schema 28 for a community of interest profile. The schema 28 resides at the access directory 26 in the architecture 10 of FIG. 1, and is parsed for the validation of the user as well as construction of the security credentials. This schema has been designed to address various core issues to support the applied security technique. First, due to its global applicability and flexible reuse depending upon domain application, the schema 28 becomes a common core vernacular within which passing security credentials can be accomplished for multi-user multi-level security access. In addition, the schema 28, being standards based as a W3C XML schema definition, can be applied in a variety of cross domain, cross product security objects thereby increasing the interoperability of the technique.",
        "Once built, authentication server system 16 passes the XML credential data 34, e.g., in a SOAP header, to the web portal 18. Portal access directory 30 then parses the XML credential data such that the web portal can decide which subsets of the secure data 20 the user has access to. Specifically, data items stored within secure data 20 may exist at any level within a multi-level data structure and can be tagged at any level (e.g., at hierarchical nodes, at directory/file/data levels, at rows within a database, etc.). Thus, it is possible to control who should have access to very fine granular data, e.g., a row of data.",
        "Data tagging within each domain is keyed to the XML security schema 28 within the context of relational database row title for underlying datasets as the type descriptor. It is possible to maintain a meta-data repository consisting of URL pointers to enhance search efficiency as a possible implementation of this invention.",
