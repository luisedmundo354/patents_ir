        "The present invention relates to a communication device with an adjustable brightness, and more particularly to a communication device capable of adjusting the brightness of its light source according to the environment.",
        "If a traditional mobile phone is powered on and set to a using mode such as dialing a call or inputting a short message, a plurality of light emitting devices such as a light emitting diode (LED) installed in the mobile phone will obtain power.

        "However, the design of the light emitting components on the mobile phone produces a light source with a constant brightness only, regardless of the environment, so that if the mobile phone is used in an environment with strong sunlight, the light emitting component still produces the light source with a constant brightness. Such arrangement not only wastes power, but also reduces the life of the light emitting components. Furthermore, if the mobile phone is used at nighttime, the light emitting component still produces a light source with the constant brightness, and such bright light will affect other people. Therefore, finding a way of designing a communication device with an adjustable brightness is an important subject that demands immediate attention and feasible solutions.",

Users can quickly change the brightness of the light protected from the light emitting unit 40 to achieve the effects of saving power, extending the life of the light emitting unit 40, and not disturbing other people.",
        "In the present invention as shown in FIG. 1, the communication device 10 further comprises an input circuit 60, a display circuit 65, a memory circuit 70, a wireless circuit 80, and a sound circuit 90, wherein the input circuit 60 and the control circuit 20 are electrically coupled with each other, and the input circuit 60 includes a plurality of press buttons 61, and one of the press buttons 61 can be pressed to produce a corresponding input signal and send the input signal to the control circuit 20.
