        "The present invention relates to a steel roll for metal rolling, more specifically to a roll for forming irregularities on a surface of an aluminum plate by embossing and to a support for a lithographic printing plate obtained by use of the roll.",
        "In a method of manufacturing a support for a lithographic printing plate by forming irregularities on a surface of an aluminum plate by embossing or the like with a steel roll provided with irregularities in advance, a roll for metal rolling formed by shot-blasting the surface of the steel roll has been known (JP 60-36196 A). There are also disclosed other related methods, namely, a rolling method using a steel roll fabricated by honing (forming 500 pieces/mm2 or more irregularities each having an Ra of 0.5 to 1.5 \u03bcm and a depth of 0.6 \u03bcm or above) while applying a draft of 2% to 20% (JP 62-25094 A), a rolling method using a roll fabricated by chemical etching or honing so as to form 500 pieces/mm2 or more irregularities each having an Ra of 0.5 to 1.5 \u03bcm and a depth of 0.6 \u03bcm or above while applying a draft of 2% to 20% (JP 62-111792 A), and a rolling method using a roll fabricated by electric discharge machining (forming 500 pieces/mm2 or more irregularities each having an Ra of 0.7 to 1.7 \u03bcm and a depth of 0.6 \u03bcm or above) while applying a draft of 2% to 20% (JP 62-218189 A).",
        "Concerning the surface of the roll for metal rolling, the conventional techniques have proved that the life duration of the roll is enhanced by regulating positions of peaks of the irregularities formed on the surface of the roll (such positions may be hereinafter referred to as \u201clevels of peaks on the roll surface\u201d when appropriate). However, the conventional roll for rolling an aluminum plate for a support for a lithographic printing plate has been formed with a roughened surface by hitting the surface with abrasives through blasting such as air blasting or shot blasting. Accordingly, the levels of the peaks on the roll surface tended to be uneven. In this way, it has been difficult to obtain the roll surface having desired irregularities sufficient for embossing, and having sufficiently regulated levels of the peaks on the roll surface.",
        "Meanwhile, by use of the rolls according to the conventional techniques, it has been difficult to obtain an aluminum support formed by providing an aluminum plate with irregularities using the roll, which has excellent printing performances particularly in the number of printed sheets, sensitivity, stain resistance, and ink spread resistance when formed into an aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate or more specifically an aluminum support for a CTP plate (which stands for the computer-to-plate technique for manufacturing a lithographic printing plate directly without using a lithographic film by scanning and exposing a presensitized plate to highly convergent radiant rays such as laser beams carrying digitalized image information).",
        "Meanwhile, as a surface roughening method for a surface of a stainless steel plate, a method of obtaining a stainless steel plate having excellent adhesion to various covering materials by performing an alternating current electrolysis in a ferric chloride aqueous solution has been known (JP 10-259499 A).",
        "As another surface roughening method for a surface of a stainless steel plate, a method of obtaining a non-glaring surface-roughened stainless steel plate with small luminosity direction dependency by performing an alternating current electrolysis in a ferric chloride aqueous solution has also been known (JP 11-61354 A).",
        "As still another surface roughening method for a surface of a stainless steel plate, a Cu\u2014Ni alloy covered stainless steel plate obtained by performing Ni plating and Cu plating on a roughened surface formed by performing an alterating current electrolysis in a ferric chloride aqueous solution has also been known (JP 11-61377 A).",
        "In addition, there has also been known a surface roughening method for enhancing adhesion of a steel plate to coating films or adhesives which includes performing an anodic electrolysis for surface roughening by using a steel plate other than stainless steel such as ordinary steel or special steel as an anodic electrode and applying current density in a range of 50 to 150 A/dm2 while generating oxygen bubbles on a steel surface (JP 2003-3300 A).",
        "As a roll for metal rolling for a process used in rolling a steel plate or the like, there has been known a chromium-plated roll for metal rolling formed by performing an electrolytic treatment using a dull finished roll as an anode in an electrolytic solution and thereby increasing the number of peaks on a surface of the roll by 1% to 50% as many as the number of peaks before the electrolysis (JP 64-8293 A).",
        "There have also been known a chromium-plated roll for metal rolling formed by reducing surface roughness in terms of Rz by 5% to 20% as compared to initial roughness before or after chromium plating (JP 61-202707 A), a chromium-plated roll formed by plating chromium using a chromium plating solution including chromic anhydride and sulfuric acid while using the roll as an anode in an etching treatment, which is performed after reducing surface roughness in terms of Rz by 5% to 20% as compared to initial roughness (JP 61-201800 A), and a chromium-plated roll formed by performing a electrolytic treatment in a chromium plating solution while using a bright finish roll as an anode, increasing the number of peaks on a surface of the roll represented by peaks per inch (PPI) by 1.3 to 15 times as many as the initial number of peaks, performing chromium plating while using the roll as a cathode, and then polishing the surface of the plated roll (JP 1-123094 A).",
        "Meanwhile, as a method of manufacturing a chromium-plated roll, there has been known a method including the steps of performing an electrolytic treatment in an electrolytic solution while using a roll base material as an anode, and then performing chromium plating in a chromium plating bath having Fe concentration less than 5 g/dm3, by increasing current density from 0 to 25-35 A/dm2 in a time period of 10 to 30 minutes while using the roll base material as a cathode, maintaining the current density for 2 to 3 minutes, and then reducing and retaining the current density to 20-30 A/dm2 (JP 2001-240994 A), for example.",
        "In these rolls, the surface of the steel roll before the chromium plating may be subjected to an etching treatment so as to enhance adhesion to a chromium-plated layer. However, the roll used for rolling steel plates and the like includes the chromium-plated surface which is configured to roll and finish a cold-rolled steel plate smoothly irrespective of whether the roll is formed as a roll for highly smooth bright steel plates or as a roll for appropriately roughened dull steel plates. Accordingly, an intended shape of a surface of an end product is completely different as compared to a transfer roll for embossing.",
        "In addition, in terms of the rolls for metal rolling, the methods of manufacturing the roll for metal rolling, manufacturing devices, and plating devices, various techniques have been known as disclosed in JP 7-180084 A (a plating device), JP 63-99166 A (a mirror surface polishing device), JP 8-27594 A (a method of manufacturing a steel plate and a chromium-plated roll therefor), JP 5-65686 A (a method of manufacturing a dull roll for metal rolling), JP 2003-171799 A (a batchwise chromium plating method and equipment), JP 3-47985 A (a chromium plating method), JP 2002-47595 A (a chromium plating method and a chromium plating apparatus), and the like.",
        "The inventors of the present invention have found out that it was possible to obtain a presensitized plate having excellent printing performances particularly in the number of printed sheets and sensitivity by the method of forming a support for a lithographic printing plate which includes rolling an aluminum plate using a roll having regulated peak levels on a surface of a roll provided with irregularities as a steel roll for rolling an aluminum plate for a support for a lithographic printing plate, and further performing a chemical etching treatment, an electrochemical surface roughening treatment, an anodic oxidation treatment, a sealing treatment, a hydrophilic treatment, and the like. In this way, the inventors have invented a roll for embossing an aluminum plate.",
        "Moreover, the inventors have found out that it was possible to obtain the roll having regulated positions of the levels of the peaks on the surface thereof, a lager number of the peaks, and finer pitches among the peaks, by subjecting the steel roll for metal rolling to an electrolytic treatment using an aqueous solution of at least one acid selected from the group consisting of chromic acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid. The inventors have also found out that it was possible to obtain a presensitized plate having excellent printing performances particularly in the number of printed sheets, sensitivity, stain resistance, and ink spread resistance by the method of forming a support for a lithographic printing plate which includes rolling an aluminum plate using this roll for metal rolling to emboss the aluminum plate, and then performing a chemical etching treatment and an electrochemical surface roughening treatment. In this way, the inventors have invented a roll for metal rolling. Here, in case of performing an electrolytic treatment without using chromic acid, it is possible to reduce chromic acid waste fluids.",
        "Specifically, the present invention will provide the following aspects:\n\n    (1) a roll for metal rolling including a roughened surface formed on a surface of a steel roll by an electrolytic treatment in an electrolytic solution while using the roll as an anode, and a chromium-plated layer formed on the roughened surface;\n    (2) the roll for metal rolling according to the aspect (1), in which the electrolytic solution is an aqueous solution of at least one acid selected from the group consisting of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid;\n    (3) the roll for metal rolling according to the aspect (1), in which the electrolytic solution is an aqueous solution at least including chromic acid;\n    (4) the roll for metal rolling according to any one of the aspects (1) to (3), in which the surface of the steel roll is subjected to a mirror surface polishing treatment in advance;\n    (5) the roll for metal rolling according to any one of the aspects (1) to (4), in which the surface of the roll after the electrolytic treatment has an average surface roughness Ra in a range of 0.5 to 2 \u03bcm and an average interval of irregularities Sm in a range of 10 to 200 \u03bcm;\n    (6) the roll for metal rolling according to any one of the aspects (1) to (5), in which the average surface roughness Ra on the surface of the steel roll before performing the electrolytic treatment in the electrolytic solution while using the roll as the anode is in a range of 0.01 to 0.3 \u03bcm;\n    (7) the roll for metal rolling according to any one of the aspects (1) to (6), in which the roll for metal rolling is used for embossing an aluminum plate;\n    (8) a method of manufacturing an aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate including the step of transferring irregularities onto a surface of an aluminum plate by use of the roll for metal rolling according to any one of the aspects (1) to (7); and\n    (9) A support for a lithographic printing plate obtained by subjecting an aluminum plate which have irregularities transferred onto a surface of the aluminum plate by use of the roll for metal rolling according to any one of the aspects (1) to (7), to a chemical etching treatment and an electrochemical surface roughening treatment.",
        "The roll for metal rolling of the present invention includes the roughened surface on the surface of the roll formed by the electrolytic treatment in the electrolytic solution while using the roll as the anode. By embossing the aluminum plate with this roll, it is possible to obtain the aluminum plate with the uneven structure having the regulated positions of the levels of the peaks and a lager number of the peaks. If the lithographic printing plate is formed by using the aluminum plate as the support, the lithographic printing plate has excellent printing performances particularly in the number of printed sheets and sensitivity. Moreover, since the uneven structure on the surface of the roll having fine peak pitches are transferred onto the aluminum plate, it is possible to obtain the presensitized plate having excellent printing performances particularly in the number of printed sheets, sensitivity, stain resistance, and ink spread resistance by forming the lithographic printing plate while using the aluminum plate having this uneven structure as the support.",

        "As a result of extensive studies and researches, the inventors of the present invention have found out that it was possible to obtain a presensitized plate having excellent printing performances particularly in the number of printed sheets and sensitivity by performing an appropriate electrolytic treatment without using blasting to obtain a roll having an uneven structure, that is, a roll having irregularities formed on a surface thereof and forming a support for a lithographic printing plate through rolling of an aluminum plate using the roll. Here, the uneven structure is characterized by having regulated positions of levels of peaks on a surface of the roll, a large number of peaks thereon, and fine pitches among the peaks. In this way, the inventors have invented a roll for metal rolling.",
        "A roll for metal rolling of the present invention can be used for embossing all kinds of metal. Among them, the roll is suitable for embossing an aluminum plate, and particularly preferable for embossing an aluminum plate to be used as a support for a lithographic printing plate. The most preferable use of the roll for metal rolling of the present invention is an application to a roll for embossing an aluminum plate for a support for a CTP lithographic printing plate.",
        "(Roll for Embossing Aluminum Plate)",
        "(1) Material and Pretreatment of Roll",
        "A roll is made of steel, or more particularly forged steel. The material used for the roll in the present invention is not particularly limited, and it is possible to use various kinds of steel such as ordinary steel, tool steel (SKD) generally used for rolls for metal rolling, high-speed steel (SKH), high carbon chromium bearing steel (SUJ), or forged steel containing alloy elements of carbon, chromium, molybdenum and vanadium. It is also possible to use high chromium alloyed cast iron containing chromium in a range of about 10 to 20 wt % to increase the roll life.",
        "The roll for metal rolling is polished in advance by use of a grindstone or the like in order to improve cylindricity and parallelism. When observed microscopically, there are striped irregularities on a surface thereof. It is possible to eliminate the striped irregularities by further subjecting the roll to mirror surface finish, thus obtaining the peaks having the regulated levels easily when the surface of the roll is etched in a subsequent electrolytic treatment. The mirror surface finish may include grinding with a grindstone, a buffing treatment, an electrolytic polishing treatment, and the like. Among these treatments, the buffing treatment is particularly preferred. It is preferable to perform a hardening treatment, such as quenching or a radial nitriding treatment, before performing an electrolytic treatment applying the roll used in the present invention as an anode.",
        "It is preferable to set the average surface roughness Ra of the surface of the roll before performing an electrolytic treatment in an electrolytic solution while using the roll as an anode in a range of 0.01 to 0.3 \u03bcm and a maximum level Ry in a range of 0.01 to 3 \u03bcm. It is more preferable to set the Ra in a range of 0.15 to 0.25 \u03bcm and the Ry in a range of 0.05 to 2 \u03bcm. It is difficult to obtain a surface having the Ra less than 0.01 \u03bcm at low costs. When the Ra exceeds 0.3 \u03bcm, the levels of the peaks on the surface of the roll are not regulated when the roll is subjected to the electrolytic treatment. Accordingly, the roll life may be shortened. It is difficult to obtain a surface having the Ry less than 0.01 \u03bcm at low costs. When the Ry exceeds 3 \u03bcm, the levels of the peaks on the surface of the roll are not regulated when the roll is subjected to the electrolytic treatment. Accordingly, the roll life may be shortened.",
        "(2) Electrolytic Treatment",
        "The surface of the roll is roughened by performing an electrolytic treatment in an electrolytic solution while using the roll as an anode. As the electrolytic solution, it is possible to use any kinds of aqueous solution of acids generally applied to surface roughening treatments on metal, such as nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, chromic acid, phosphoric acid, and mixtures thereof.",
        "The surface of the roll can be roughened by performing an electrolytic treatment in an aqueous solution of at least one acid selected from the group consisting of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid, while using the roll as the anode. The electrolytic solution is the aqueous solution of at least one acid selected from the group consisting of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and the phosphoric acid, and may be a bath not containing chromic acid. The use of chromic acid is often avoided because chromic acid imposes high burdens on the environment occasionally. By performing an electrolysis using the aqueous solution of at least one strong acid selected from the group consisting of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid, it is possible to obtain finer peaks on the roughened surface. It is preferable to form a support for a lithographic printing plate by rolling an aluminum plate using this roll, because it is possible to obtain a presensitized plate having excellent printing performances particularly in the number of printed sheets, sensitivity, stain resistance, and ink spread resistance.",
        "It is preferable that this electrolytic solution contain metal ions which are contained in the roll to be subjected to surface roughening. When necessary, it is preferable to add the metal ions contained in the roll in the form of a relevant metal salt.",
        "As for concrete conditions of the electrolytic treatment, although it is possible to use both an alternating current and a direct current as a power source waveform, it is particularly preferable to use the direct current.",
        "When using the alternating current, it is possible to use any of a sinusoidal wave, a rectangular wave, a trapezoidal wave, and a triangular wave. A frequency of such a wave can be selected from a range of 0.1 to 120 Hz. Moreover, a ratio QR/QF between a total quantity of electricity QF applied when performing an anodic reaction and a total quantity of electricity QR applied when performing a cathodic reaction can be selected from a range of 0.1 to 1.",
        "When using the direct current, it is possible to use any of a smooth direct current, a direct current subjected to three-phase full-wave rectification, a direct current subjected to single-phase full-wave rectification, and the like. In any case, it is particularly preferable to use a direct current having a ripple rate equal to or below 5%.",
        "The current density is set preferably in a range of 20 to 150 A/dm2, or more preferably in a range of 30 to 100 A/dm2. It is difficult to achieve uniform surface roughening if the current density is below 20 A/dm2, and power costs are increased because of a high electrolytic voltage if the current density is above 150 A/dm2.",
        "When performing the surface roughening treatment in the electrolytic solution of the strong acid while using the roll as the anode, the quantity of electricity is set preferably in a range of 500 to 30000 C/dm2, or more preferably in a range of 800 to 15000 C/dm2. Sufficient surface roughness cannot be obtained if the quantity of electricity is below 500 C/dm2, and the surface tends to be uneven if the quantity of electricity is above 30000 C/dm2.",
        "The quantity of electricity for obtaining the same Ra varies depending on the material of the roll, conditions for a thermal treatment of the roll, the type of the electrolytic solution used therein, and conditions for the electrolysis. Accordingly, it is necessary to adjust the quantity of electricity while considering these various conditions.",
        "Solution temperature is set preferably in a range of 20\u00b0 C. to 60\u00b0 C., or more preferably in a range of 30\u00b0 C. to 55\u00b0 C.",
        "Temperature locality (uneven distribution) may be caused by heat generation attributable to the Joule heat generated in the course of the electrolysis if the solution temperature is below 20\u00b0 C. When the temperature locality is present, an electric current tends to flow more on a high-temperature portion, and resultantly the surface of the roll is not roughened uniformly.",
        "On the contrary, water evaporation is excessive if the solution temperature is above 60\u00b0 C. Such high temperature is not preferable because frequent concentration management or liquid amount management is required.",

Accordingly, when the aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate is manufactured by use of this aluminum plate, a lithographic printing plate will lack shininess. Levels of peaks are not regulated when the surface of the roll having the Ra above 2.0 \u03bcm is formed by the electrolytic treatment. Accordingly, when the aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate is manufactured by use of this aluminum plate, a lithographic printing plate will lack sensitivity. It is difficult to obtain the sufficient Ra on the aluminum plate after rolling by use of the roll having the Sm below 10 \u03bcm. On the contrary, when the Sm is above 200 \u03bcm, it is not possible to obtain the sufficient number of printed sheets when manufactured into the aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate.",

The maximum level Ry concerning a standard length, the average interval of irregularities (an average value within the standard length) Sm, and the average inclination pitch \u0394a are measured similarly.",
        "By regulating the levels of the peaks, it is possible to increase the life of the roll for metal rolling. Further, when the roll is used for providing the irregularities in the process of cold rolling the aluminum support for use in the lithographic printing plate, depths of dents of the aluminum plate provided with the irregularities become uniform and pitches of the dents become finer, whereby formation of locally deep dents are avoided. Accordingly, the lithographic printing plate using this aluminum plate has good sensitivity. Such an effect is significant when manufacturing a CTP lithographic printing plate.",
        "(3) Chromium Plating",
        "As a chromium plating bath, a bath containing chromic anhydride (chromium trioxide) with addition of a small amount of sulfuric acid, a fluoride or a silicofluoride as a catalyst is used. As for the anode, a lead alloy is cited as an insoluble anode, for example. Trivalent chromic acid generated in a plating solution due to an electrolytic reaction is contained in the plating solution. An optimum value exists for the trivalent chromic acid, and the concentration thereof is set preferably in a range of 1 to 7 g/L. Current efficiency is degraded when the trivalent chromium is either too high or too low. Although the trivalent chromium is generated in a chromium plating electrolytic reaction, a reducer such as glucose, tartaric acid, chromium carbonate, or oxalic acid is often added to generate the trivalent chromium. Among them, chromium carbonate is particularly preferred as the reducer.",

It is most preferable to use a so-called Sargent's bath containing chromic anhydride and sulfuric acid, for example, which is generally used as a hard chromium plating bath.",
        "It is possible to use the same bath for the bath to perform the electrolytic treatment in the electrolytic solution containing chromic acid as the main ingredient while using the roll as the anode and for the bath to perform the hard chromium plating. However, iron liquates out during the electrolytic treatment in the electrolytic solution while using the roll as the anode, and such an increase in iron complicates fine plating. Accordingly, it is preferable to use mutually different baths. When using different baths, the activity of the surface of the roll is degraded because the roll travels in the air, and such degradation in activity complicates fine plating. Therefore, it is preferable to perform a reverse electrolytic treatment (an etching treatment) by applying current density in a range of 20 to 80 A/dm2 for 10 to 60 seconds immediately before the chromium plating in order to activate the surface again.",
        "As for the plating conditions, the solution temperature is set preferably in a range of 20\u00b0 C. to 70\u00b0 C. or more preferably in a range of 40\u00b0 C. to 60\u00b0 C., and the current density is set preferably in a range of 20 to 80 A/dm2 or more preferably in a range of 25 to 60 A/dm2. It is possible to use either a direct current or an alternating current as the power waveform. However, it is preferable to use the direct current. The direct current preferably contains a ripple component of not more than 5%. Concerning the electric current, it is preferable to raise the current from low current density to high current density gradually in a period from 1 to 100 seconds and to retain the constant current thereafter. According to this method, it is easier to achieve uniform plating.",
        "The thickness of the hard chromium plating is set preferably in a range of 1 to 15 \u03bcm or most preferably in a range of 3 to 9 \u03bcm. Sufficient abrasion resistance cannot be achieved if the thickness is below 1 \u03bcm. If the thickness is above 15 \u03bcm, the surface is smoothened by plating. In this case, it is not possible to exert the effect of the irregularities provided by the electrolytic treatment while using the roll as the anode.",
        "It is preferable to set the average surface roughness Ra on the surface of the roll after the hard chromium plating treatment in a range of 0.5 to 2.0 \u03bcm and to set the Sm in a range of 10 to 200 \u03bcm. If the Ra is below 0.5 \u03bcm, it is not possible to transfer the sufficient irregularities. Accordingly, when the aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate is manufactured by use of this aluminum plate, a lithographic printing plate will lack shininess. The levels of peaks are not regulated when the surface of the roll having the Ra above 2.0 \u03bcm is formed by the electrolytic treatment. Accordingly, when the aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate is manufactured by use of this aluminum plate, a lithographic printing plate will lack sensitivity. It is difficult to obtain the sufficient Ra on the aluminum plate after rolling by use of the roll having the Sm below 10 \u03bcm. On the contrary, when the Sm is above 200 \u03bcm, it is not possible to obtain the sufficient number of printed sheets when manufactured into the aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate.",
        "The Ry on the surface of the roll after the hard chromium plating treatment is set preferably in a range of 5 to 25 \u03bcm (more preferably in a range of 7 to 15 \u03bcm), and the \u0394a is set preferably in a range of 5 to 25degrees (more preferably in a range of 8 to 20 degrees).",
        "Concerning the peaks after the electrolytic treatment on the surface of the roll while using the roll as the anode or after the hard chromium plating in the present invention, it is preferable that the peaks be uniformly dispersed when projecting the surface from immediately above in a planar shape, and that the number of the peaks be in a range of 10 to 1000 pieces in each 400-\u03bcm square area or more preferably 50 to 500 pieces in the unit area.",
        "In light of the abrasion resistance, it is preferable to set the hardness of the surface of the roll in a range of 700 Hv to 1000 Hv. Moreover, after the hard chromium plating, it is preferable to set the hardness in a range of 800 Hv to 1200 Hv.",
        "(4) Preferred Use of Roll for Metal Rolling",
        "It is preferable to use the roll for metal rolling of the present invention to provide irregularities onto surfaces of aluminum plates, or more specifically to provide irregularities onto surfaces of aluminum plates for forming aluminum plates for lithographic printing plates. Among them, it is most preferable to use the roll to provide irregularities onto a surface of an aluminum plate for forming an aluminum plate for a CTP lithographic printing plate. As compared to conventional surface roughening treatments using only abrasives and brushes, according to the present invention, it is possible to suppress generation of deep and steep dents and thereby to form a support having favorable sensitivity.",
        "When embossing the aluminum plate for use in the aluminum support for a lithographic printing plate while using the roll of the present invention, the draft is set preferably in a range of 0.5% to 20%, more preferably in a range of 1% to 8%, or most preferably in a range of 1% to 5%. It is also possible to perform such rolling works for the pattern transfer through 1 to 3 paths.",
        "Parameters for the shape of the surface of the aluminum plate formed with the uneven pattern by the roll for metal rolling according to the present invention are preferably set so that the Ra is in a range of 0.4 to 1.0 \u03bcm, the Sm in a range of 30 to 150 \u03bcm, the Ry in a range of 1 to 10 \u03bcm, and the \u0394a in a range of 1 to 10 degrees, respectively in accordance with the JIS definitions.",

The content of the foreign elements in the alloys should be set equal to or below 10 wt %.",
        "In the present invention, it is preferable to use the pure aluminum plate. However, since it is difficult to manufacture completely pure aluminum in light of the smelting technology, an aluminum plate used in the present invention may contain small amounts of the foreign elements. Compositions of the aluminum plates used in the present invention are not particularly limited. For example, it is possible to use publicly known aluminum alloy plates designated as JIS A1050, JIS A1100, JIS A3005, International registered alloy 3103A, and the like as appropriate.",

The thickness can be changed as appropriate depending on the size of a printing machine, the size of the printing plate, user's requests, and the like.",
        "When forming the aluminum alloy into a plate member, it is possible to adopt the following method, for example. Firstly, aluminum alloy molten metal adjusted to given contents of alloy components is subjected to a cleaning treatment and then cast in accordance with a conventional method. As for the cleaning treatment, in order to remove unnecessary gas in the molten metal such as hydrogen, a flux treatment, a degasification treatment using argon gas, chlorine gas or the like, a filtering treatment using any of a so-called rigid media filter such as a ceramic tube filter or a ceramic foam filter, a filter applying alumina flakes or alumina balls as a filtering element, a glass cloth filter, and the like, or a combined treatment of the degasification treatment and the filtering treatment is performed.",
        "It is preferable that these cleaning treatments be carried out to prevent the occurrence of defects attributable to foreign substance in the molten metal such as non-metal intermediates or oxides, and defects attributable to gas dissolved in the molten metal. Techniques related to filtering of molten metal are disclosed in various publications, namely, JP 6-57432 A, JP 3-162530 A, JP 5-140659 A, JP 4-231425 A, JP 4-276031 A, JP 5-311261 A, JP 6-136466 A, and the like.

        "In the DC casting method, solidification takes place at a cooling rate in a range of 0.5 to 30\u00b0 C./sec. When the cooling rate is below 0.5\u00b0 C./sec, a large amount of coarse intermetallic compounds are often formed. When the DC casting is performed, an ingot having a plate thickness of 300 to 800 mm can be fabricated. The ingot is treated according to a conventional method and is subjected to facing as appropriate to cut the surface layer usually in a range of 1 to 30 mm or preferably 1 to 10 mm. Before or after the facing, the ingot is subjected to a homogenization treatment as appropriate. When the homogenization treatment is performed, a heat treatment is performed at 450 to 620\u00b0 C. for 1 to 48 hours to prevent coarse intermetallic compounds from being produced. Sufficient effect of the homogenization treatment is often not attained when the heat treatment time is shorter than one hour. In execution of the homogenization treatment is advantageous in the cost reduction.",
        "Thereafter, hot rolling and cold rolling are performed to obtain an aluminum flat-rolled plate. The initial temperature of the hot rolling is appropriately in a range of 350 to 500\u00b0 C.

        "The aluminum plate finished into the given thickness as in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 mm by the above-described processes may be further treated to improve the flatness by use of a reformation apparatus such as roller leveler or a tension leveler. Although it is possible to perform the improvement in flatness after cutting the aluminum plate into sheets, it is preferable to perform the improvement in flatness in a state of a continuous coil to enhance productivity. It is also possible to feed the aluminum plate into a slitter line so as to form the aluminum plate into a given plate width. Moreover, it is possible to provide thin oil films on surfaces of the aluminum plates to prevent occurrence of scratches due to friction between the aluminum plates. Such oil films may be volatile or nonvolatile as appropriate.",

In this case, it is more preferable to set the 0.2% proof stress equal to or above 100 MPa. In particular, it is possible to adopt an aluminum material having additional Mg or Mn to seek the flexure strength in the aluminum plate. However, an increase in the flexure strength causes degradation in fitness to a plate cylinder of a printing machine. Accordingly, appropriate material quality and amounts of addition of minor components are selected depending on the usage.

Furthermore, it is possible to reduce an etching amount to about 10 g/m2 or less in a first alkaline etching treatment to be described later, and thereby to reduce the costs.
