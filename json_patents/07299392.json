        "The present invention relates to a semiconductor integrated circuit device and a method of designing the same semiconductor integrated circuit device and particularly to a technique which can be effectively applied to the operation test technique of an internal logic circuit.",
        "Supply of clock from an external circuit cannot be controlled for a digital integrated circuit device comprising a built-in pulse generating circuit such as a PLL circuit. Therefore, in the AC (Alternate Current) operation test of an internal logic circuit, it is considered to provide a combination circuit as illustrated in FIG. 17 in order to control the clock pulse to be supplied to the internal logic circuit. Namely, here is introduced the sequence that a test pattern is set to a flip-flop FF of the logic circuit using a scanning circuit, a combination circuit is controlled to output the first clock pulse to transfer an input signal to the logic stage and generate the second clock pulse, and an output signal of the logic stage is fetched by the flip-flop FF and a test result is collected using the scanning circuit. The Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication 1999(11)-142478 discloses an example of a semiconductor integrated circuit which comprises a clock multiplying circuit within a chip thereof in order to execute the test during the actual operation.",
        "In above combination circuit, the test is possible only in the fixed combination among the multi-phase clocks formed by the PLL circuit. Moreover, the circuit design is required for each combination corresponding to logic circuit, operation frequency and clock used and thereby the number of procedures required for circuit design is increased. Accordingly, an external clock must be applied for the test in the desired timing but a logic circuit to realize high speed operation is introduced and development of a high performance test apparatus which can verify the timing margin of such high speed logic circuit is necessary using an extraordinary development cost. Therefore, such development of high performance test apparatus is not practical.",
        "It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor integrated circuit device provided with a test clock generating circuit enabling high performance test operation. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of designing a semiconductor integrated circuit device enabling the setting of a high precision timing margin or the like. The aforementioned and other objects and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from description of the present specification and the accompanying drawings.",
        "A profile of the present invention will be explained briefly as follows. Namely, a test clock generating circuit provided with a register sequential circuit and a clock transfer control circuit is provided between a pulse generating circuit and a logic circuit. When a test operation is validated, transfer of clock pulse formed by the pulse generating circuit to the logic circuit is stopped, the clock transfer control circuit is controlled with the sequential circuit depending on the setting information of the register and the clock pulse for operating the logic circuit is outputted using the clock pulse generated in the pulse generating circuit.",
        "Another profile of the present invention will be explained briefly as follows. Namely, a logic circuit for realizing the desired logic functions and a pulse generating circuit to form the clock pulse required for operation of such logic circuit are designed on a logic design tool utilizing a computer and a test clock generating circuit, which is provided with a register sequential circuit and a clock output control circuit to stop, when the test operation is validated, the transfer of the clock pulse formed by the pulse generating circuit to the logic circuit and outputs a clock pulse for operating the logic circuit using the clock pulse formed by the pulse generating circuit by controlling the clock transfer control circuit with the sequential circuit depending on the setting information of the register is built to above circuit.

In this embodiment, PLL (Phase Lock Loop) circuit generates an internal clock of higher frequency for an externally supplied clock pulse and then supplies this internal clock to a logic circuit (user logic).",
        "A basic structure of this logic circuit is formed in combination in unit of flip-flop FF\u2014logic stage\u2014flip-flop FF and a clock pulse is supplied to above flip-flops FFs. A signal held in the flip-flop FF provided in an input side of the logic stage is inputted to such logic stage synchronously with the clock pulse. In the logic stage, logic process is executed corresponding to an input signal and a result is transferred to an input terminal of a flip-flop FF provided in the output side thereof. The flip-flop FF in the output side fetches and hold an output signal of the logic stage synchronously with the next clock pulse. As explained above, a logic sequence is executed synchronously with the clock pulse.",
        "In view of performing an AC test of a logic circuit as explained above, a test input signal is supplied to a flip-flop FF provided in the input side of the logic stage under the condition that supply of the clock pulse is stopped and after setting of the test input signal is completed, it is required to supply, to the logic stage, the test input signal fetched to the flip-flop FF by supplying the first clock pulse and then to supply the second clock pulse in order to fetch the corresponding output signal to the flip-flop FF. However, in a clock pulse generating circuit using a PLL circuit as explained above, it is difficult to supply/stop two clock pulses in the necessary timing with an external control signal because these clock pulses have higher frequency than that of the pulse externally supplied.",
        "In this embodiment, a test clock generating circuit is provided between a PLL circuit and a logic circuit explained above. This test clock generating circuit is controlled to generate a test clock in the desired timing depending on the sequence of test clock generation. Namely, a sequential circuit (state machine) generates a test clock required for test of a logic circuit depending on the clock generation sequence. The generation sequence of the clock required to realize AC test operation can be controlled while a clock pulse is generated with a built-in clock generating circuit such as PLL circuit by giving thereto a function to control the supply of clock to the logic circuit depending on the input condition of the sequential circuit.",
        "The test clock generating circuit is provided with a gate means as a clock pulse transfer control circuit like an AND gate circuit. Therefore, a clock pulse formed in the PLL circuit is transferred to the logic circuit during the ordinary operation to execute the required logic operations. During the AC test operation for verifying such logic operations, the gate means is closed to stop the supply of clock pulse generated by the PLL circuit to the logic circuit. Accordingly, the clock pulse is not supplied to a user logic as indicated with a dotted line.",
        "Under this clock suspending condition, a test circuit inputs a test pattern to a flip-flop FF of the logic circuit. For such input of the test pattern, the flip-flop FF of the user logic is connected to form a shift register to serially input the test pattern. When input of the test pattern is completed, the gate means is controlled to supply the first and second clock pulses.",
        "With the first clock pulse, the test pattern fetched by the flip-flop FF is outputted and is then transferred to the logic stage provided in the rear stage side. In the logic stage, the logic process is executed corresponding to the input pattern and is then transferred to the input of the flip-flop FF provided in the rear stage side. The flip-flop FF fetches a logic output from the logic stage with supply of the second clock pulse.

        "Since the timing of the diagnosis is strict for the control of clock, an independent exclusive block is prepared in the present invention. In such independent external clock interface circuit, the setting register is respectively provided for selection of instruction register and clock, control can be realized at the area near the clock because this block itself has the control logic, making easier the timing management including the delay of signal. Moreover, the TAP condition required for control can be distributed with a plurality of control signals from the diagnostic control unit itself. This distribution method is more advantageous in the cost of wiring than the system for distributing the control signal to each clock selector from the diagnostic control circuit.",
        "Since the special independent block is provided for clock control as explained above, the timing design can be realized easily and detail control logics can be prepared depending on the setting for each type of test. Moreover, since the timing design of test clock becomes easier, a proper measure can also be provided for high speed test. In addition, special test clock can also be used for each block because the control logic is provided for each clock block.",
