In other embodiments, memory 28 includes RAM 34 to facilitate temporary data storage during a time period when transceiver 12 is interrogating transponder 20 for a response. In other embodiments, memory 28 includes flash memory 32 to store data in transponder 20 that is non-volatile in order to ensure that the data is retained when transponder 20 is in a quiescent or power saving state. In some embodiments, memory 28 includes other types of non-volatile programmable memory, such as programmable read-only memory (PROM), erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), and electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM). Any one of memory types ROM 30, flash memory 32 (or other non-volatile programmable memory), or RAM 34 can be used, or any combination thereof can be used.",
        "In one embodiment, transponder 20 is an active transponder device. An active transponder is powered by an internal energy source, such as a battery configured within analog circuitry 24. Such active transponders are typically \u201cread/write,\u201d which means data stored within memory 28 of transponder 20 can be rewritten and/or modified. An active transponder can also be powered from an existing source in another electronic device. For example, where transponder 20 is an active transponder coupled within a computer system, the power supply within the computer system supplies power to the transponder.",
        "In one embodiment, transponder 20 is a passive transponder device. Passive transponders operate without a separate internal power source and obtain operating power from transceiver 12. Rather than having a battery within analog circuitry 24, for example, passive tags instead can use a strongly capacitive circuit and a charge pump within analog circuitry 24. The capacitive circuit and charge pump are configured to receive radio frequency energy from transceiver 12 and store it for use within transponder 20, for example, to control digital circuit 26 and memory 28.",
        "Since active transponders accommodate an internal battery, they are typically larger in size than passive transponders. Memory size within an active transponder varies, but can be fairly significant with some systems operating, for example, with up to a megabyte or more of memory. Active transponders also typically have a longer ready range such that transceiver 12 and transponder 20 are typically placed apart at greater distances than in the case of passive transponders. In the same way, passive transponders typically have shorter read ranges, but are typically much smaller and lighter than active transponders and are typically less expensive.",
        "In addition to including a battery for active transponders or capacitive circuit and charge pump for passive transponders, analog circuitry 24 typically include interface circuits for data transfer between transponder antenna 22 and digital circuitry 26. Digital circuitry 26 in turn typically includes control logic, security logic, and internal logic or microprocessor capabilities. This control logic controls the flow of data to and from memory 28.",
        "FIG. 3 illustrates transponder 40 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Transponder 40 includes transponder antenna 42, analog circuitry 44, digital circuitry 46, read only memory (ROM) 50, flash memory 52, random access memory (RAM) 54, and fuse 60. In one embodiment, fuse 60 is configured to allow continued operation of transponder 40 when not blown. When fuse 60 is blown, however, transponder 40 becomes inoperable such that communication with transponder 40 with a transceiver is no longer possible.",
        "In one embodiment, fuse 60 is configured to disable transponder 40 under certain conditions and allow it to function in other conditions. In operation, transponder 40 is used in conjunction with a transceiver such that a transceiver first sends radio frequency (RF) signals to transponder 40. These RF signals are received via transponder antenna 42 and sent to analog circuitry 44. In one embodiment, analog circuitry 44 includes a capacitive circuit and a charge pump. In this way, received RF signals charge the capacitive circuit within analog circuitry 44. The storage energy is then used to energize digital circuitry 46.",
        "In one embodiment, digital circuitry 46 includes control circuitry for activating flash memory 52, RAM 54, and ROM 50 as well as fuse 60. In this way, upon continued or periodic activation by digital circuitry 46, fuse 60 stays enabled such that transponder 40 sends RF signals back to the transponder. In one embodiment, the transceiver then subsequently interrogates transponder 40 in order to read a digitized code stored in memory 48 of transponder 40. When RF signals are no longer continually or periodically received by transponder 40 from the transceiver, however, fuse 60 will blow and disable transponder 40. In this way, transponder 40 will no longer be able to send RF signals back to the transceiver.",
        "In one embodiment, transponder 40 will no longer receive RF signals from the transceiver when transponder 40 is out of a set range of the transceiver. In this way, whenever the transponder 40 is out of this set range of the transceiver, fuse 60 will blow, thereby disabling transponder 40. In one embodiment fuse 60 is an electronic fuse.",
        "FIG. 4 illustrates RFID system 80 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. RFID system 80 includes computer system 81 having a transceiver 82. Transceiver 82 has a transceiver antenna 84, which can be embedded or external to transceiver 82. RFID system 80 further includes first and second transponders 92 and 94, which are coupled to first and second system components 96 and 98, respectively. Medium interface 86 is between transceiver antenna 84 and first and second transponders 92 and 94.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, RFID system 80 is used in conjunction with assuring the security of computer system 81. In the way, RFID system 80 detects whether first and second system components 96 and 98 have been removed from the proximity of computer system 81 by having transceiver 82 remotely detect the presence of transponders 92 and 94. Because transponders 92 and 94 are fixed to first and second system components 96 and 98, RFID system 80 determines that first and second system components 96 and 98 have been removed from the proximity of computer system 81 when transponders 92 and 94 are out of range of transceiver 82. Thus, RFID system 80 disables computer system 81 when transponders 92 and 94 are out of range of transceiver 82.",
        "In one embodiment, RFID system 80 utilizes first and second transponders 92 and 94 and transceiver 82, which is embedded in an electronic module such as computer system 81. Transceiver 82 is configured to scan the proximity of medium interface 86 specifically for first and second transponders 92 and 94. In one embodiment, transponders 92 and 94 are configured like transponder 40 in FIG. 3, such that each has a memory and a fuse. A unique identification code is stored in each memory of transponders 92 and 94. If transceiver 82 scans and receives the unique code from each of transponders 92 and 94, then computer system 81 is allowed to function normally. If transceiver 82 scans and does not receive the unique code from each of transponders 92 and 94, however, then the fuse (or several fuse links in some embodiments) is blown.",
        "In one embodiment, computer system 81 further includes an embedded-security device such as a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). TPM is known to those skilled in the art as a means for authenticating internal and external communications to a computer or computer system by using an encrypted digital signature. TPMs typically provide authentication of components of computing systems that are not transferable from system to system. In other words, the security of a computing system can be compromised if the TPM is moved from one system to another. In one embodiment, each of first and second system components 96 and 98 are TPMs. In this way, corresponding transponders 92 and 94 are embedded in TPMs 96 and 98. In one embodiment, TPMs 96 and 98 are physically connected within computer system 81 and in another embodiment TPMs 96 and 98 are coupled externally to computer system 81.",
        "Thus, with one embodiment of RFID system 80, TPMs 96 and 98, along with embedded transponders 92 and 92, can be physically disconnected from computer system 81 without sacrificing or compromising the security of the system, as long as the modules are not moved out of the range established between transceiver 82 and its associated transponders 92 and 94. Thus, for example, TPMs can be removed from computer system 81 to allow repair, as long as the TPMs and embedded transponders 92 and 92 stay within range of associated transceiver 82. RFID system 80 only blows fuses within transponders 92 and 94 embedded in TPMs 96 and 98 when TPMs 96 and 98 are powered on and far enough away from away from transceiver 82. Transceiver 82 is essentially \u201ckeyed\u201d to transponders 92 and 94 in that it sends RF signals to transponders 92 and 94 in order to receive back the unique code stored therein. If the code is not received, the fuses are blown and the TPM is disabled. In this way, RFID system 80 provides security of computer system 81 with an embedded TPM.",
        "In one embodiment, transponders 92 and 94 each contain a one-time programmable number in their respective memories. Transceiver 82 then sends RF signals to the transponders, and receives the one-time programmable number when transponders 92 and 94 are in range to verify a match. Thus, the transceiver 82 will only check for a match if it has been programmed with the value of transponders 92 and 94.",
        "In one embodiment, the transponders 92 and 94 are transponder types that are typically attached to the system in a label, or are physically embedded in the computer system. This provides added security benefit. In this way, if the TPM with embedded transponder is removed and placed in a computer system without the matching transceiver, the TPM will be made permanently inoperable. Since, the TPM is typically tied to a particular computer system of a particular system manufacturer, RFID system 80 appropriately destroys or disables the TPM that has been removed from the proper system. At the same time, however, RFID system 80 still allows legitimate repair of a system, where the TPM has to be removed, but not moved out of the proximity of the corresponding transceiver.",
        "In one embodiment, RF signals received from transceiver 82 are received by the associated transponder antenna within first and second transponders 92 and 94, and sent to analog circuitry, which in one case includes a capacitive circuit and charge pump. Energy stored in the capacitive circuit is then used to control digital circuitry within each of first and second transponders 92 and 94. When first and second transponders 92 stop receiving RF signals, the digital circuitry is configured to activate or blow the fuse such as the transponders become disabled. In this embodiment, continued RF signal from transceiver 82 is needed to continue enabling the fuses and the transponders.",
        "In one embodiment, RFID system 80 includes first and second transponders 92 and 94, which are active transponders. In this embodiment, first and second transponders 92 and 94 are configured such that each has a battery or similar energy storage device within the analog circuitry of each transponder. This provides an RFID system 80 with more flexible range, meaning that first and second transponders 92 and 94 are operable even when placed a further distance from transceiver 82.",
        "In one embodiment, RFID system 80 includes first and second transponders 92 and 94, which are passive transponders. In one such embodiment, first and second transponders 92 and 94 are configured very similarly to transponder 40 illustrated in FIG. 3. In this way, a capacitive circuit and charge pump are provided within the analog circuitry of each of first and second transponders 92 and 94.",
        "In one embodiment of these passive first and second transponders 92 and 94, each can also further include a charge building device. In this way, radio frequency signals received from transceiver 82 by first and second transponders 92 and 94 builds up additional charge over a period of time. This additional built-up charge can then be used to power the control circuitry within first and second transponders 92 and 94. In this way, RF signals are sent by transceiver 82 to first and second transponders 92 and 94 over a first period of time. Subsequently, that charge is released and used to power control circuitry over a second period of time, which is a shorter period of time than the first. In this way, a relatively large signal is generated within each of first and second transponders 92 and 94 due to the quicker dispensing of that stored energy relative to how it was received. In one embodiment, the charge building device within passive first and second transponders 92 and 94 is a capacitive ladder, or similar circuitry for building and storing energy over time.",
        "In an alternative embodiment of RFID system 80, a transceiver is embedded within the TPM rather than the transponders. Furthermore, the transceiver is configured with a fuse, rather than the transponder. In this way, in operation of the alternative system the TPM with embedded transceiver can also be physically disconnected from computer system 81 without sacrificing or compromising the security of the system, as long as the modules are not moved out of the range established between the transceiver embedded in the module and its associated transponder. Thus, for example, the TPM can be removed from the computer system to allow repair, as long as the TPM and embedded transceiver stays within range of associated transponder. The alternative RFID system only blows fuses within the transceiver embedded in the TPM when the TPM is powered on and far enough away from away from transponder. In this way, the alternative RFID system provides security of the computer system with an embedded TPM.",
        "In one embodiment, computer system 81 is a rack-level server implementation where first and second components 96 and 98 are individual servers. In another embodiment, computer system 81 is an individual server where first and second components 96 and 98 are integrated within computer system 81. In this way, first and second components 96 and 98 are, for example, blade computers, disks, memory, I/O cards, or related components.",
        "Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that a variety of alternate and/or equivalent implementations can be substituted for the specific embodiments shown and described without departing from the scope of the present invention. This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the specific embodiments discussed herein.
