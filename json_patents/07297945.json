        "The present invention relates to a defective product inspection apparatus (probe apparatus), a probe positioning method and a probe moving method, for measuring an electric characteristic of a microscopic area of an electronic element.",
        "A defective product inspection apparatus is well known as the prior art, in which a probe contacts an area of a specimen (an electronic element) at which an electric characteristic needs to be inspected. An electric current-voltage characteristic or the like of the electronic element can be measured through the probe.",
        "JP-A-9-326425 discloses that a probe is arranged in a specimen chamber of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to measure a minute electric potential characteristic.",
        "JP-A-2000-147070 discloses a probe apparatus in which a probe information image showing an information for operating desirably a probe is formed on a display, a specimen and the probe are shown in the probe information image on the display, a probe operating image area for moving the probe is formed on the display, the probe is moved through a probe controller in accordance with an operating signal from the probe operating image area, and a movement amount from an actual current position of a front end of the probe to a target position thereof is calculated by designating each of the actual current position of the front and of the probe and the target position of the front and of the probe on the probe information image so that the probe controller operates in accordance with the movement amount to move the probe to the target position.",
        "JP-A-2000-181898 discloses a probe apparatus including a charged particle beam projection device, a specimen stage for holding a specimen holder with a specimen thereon, a specimen chamber containing the specimen stage, a probe driving mechanism for moving the probe to contact the specimen in the specimen chamber, a specimen antechamber including a first stocker connected through a valve to the specimen chamber to store temporarily the specimen holder, and a first transfer device for moving the specimen holder at least between the specimen antechamber and the specimen chamber.",
        "JP-A-2002-523784 discloses that an optical microscope slides on a microscope bridge to move to a position on a wafer chuck, and is rotated to a position for preventing from standing in the way of enabling the probe to firstly be positioned in an area of the specimen to which an user's attention is drawn.",
        "An object of the present invention is to provide a defective product inspection apparatus and method for adjusting a positional relationship between a specimen and a probe, by which apparatus and method an electric characteristic of the specimen can be measured efficiently (with making a time period needed for the inspection as small as possible) while the specimen is restrained from being damaged.",
        "According to the invention, a defective product inspection apparatus for measuring an electric characteristic of a specimen through (or with) a contact between a probe and the specimen (so that the measured electric characteristic is compared with a predetermined electric characteristic to judge whether the specimen as a product is defective or not), comprises, a specimen table for holding the specimen thereon, a probe holder for holding the probe thereon, a first measuring device for measuring a positional relationship between the probe and the specimen, and a second measuring device for measuring the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen, wherein (a measuring accuracy (resolution capability, magnification or the like) of the second measuring device is superior to a measuring accuracy (resolution capability, magnification or the like) of the first measuring device,) the apparatus further includes a base table holding thereon the specimen table and the probe holder in such a manner that the specimen table and the probe holder are movable with respect to each other on the base table to adjust the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen on the base table so that a contact area of the probe and a desired area of the specimen are capable of being brought into contact with each other, and the base table is movable between (or from) a first position at which the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen is measurable by the first measuring device and (or to) a second position at which the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen is measurable by the second measuring device. Incidentally, the specimen table is movable with respect to the base table, and the probe holder is movable with respect to the base table, so that a positional relationship between the specimen table and the base table and a positional relationship between the probe holder and the base table are adjustable independent of each other, and one of the positional relationship between the specimen table and the base table and the positional relationship between the probe holder and the base table is adjustable when the other one the positional relationship between the specimen table and the base table and the positional relationship between the probe holder and the base table is stationary.",
        "Since (the measuring accuracy of the second measuring device is superior to the measuring accuracy of the first measuring device, and) the a base table holding thereon the specimen table and the probe holder in such a manner that the specimen table and the probe holder are movable with respect to each other on the base table to adjust the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen on the base table so that a contact area of the probe and the desired area of the specimen are capable of being brought into contact with each other, and the base table is movable between (or from) the first position at which the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen is measurable by the first measuring device and (or to) the second position at which the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen is measurable by the second measuring device, a time period which is needed for measuring the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen at the second position with the measuring accuracy superior to the measuring accuracy at the first position can be decreased by the measurement at the first position, so that the electric characteristic of the specimen can be measured efficiently. If the probe and the specimen are brought into contact with each other at the second position, a time period which is needed for bringing the probe and the specimen into contact with each other at the second position can be minimized, so that the electric characteristic of the specimen can be measured efficiently. The base table may be movable with respect to at least one (or each) of the first and second measuring devices.",
        "If the first measuring device is capable of measuring the positional relationship between the probe and the specimen when the specimen is prevented from being irradiated with at least one of an ion beam and an electron beam, the specimen is prevented from being damaged by the at least one of the ion beam and the electron beam.

An electronic optical device 4 (a charged particle apparatus) such as an SEM (scanning electron microscope), a focused ion beam (FIB) device or the like including an ion pump 44 is arranged on a frame of the specimen chamber 7 to opposite to the specimen holder 2. Further, a probe rough-approaching image forming device 10 is arranged in the vicinity of the electronic optical device 4. A charged particle beam (electron beam or ion beam) is projected from the electronic optical device 4 toward the specimen holder to monitor movements of the specimen and a probe 3.",

Further, the probe rough-approaching image forming device 10 has a probe rough-approaching image forming device 10a for monitoring in a vertical direction and a probe rough-approaching image forming device 10b for monitoring in a horizontal direction, so that the condition in rough approaching between the prove and the specimen can be monitored securely in two directions perpendicular to each other. In this case, a magnification of the probe rough-approaching image forming device 10b for magnifying the image corresponding to the condition in rough approaching as seen in the horizontal direction is made higher than a magnification of the probe rough-approaching image forming device 10a for magnifying the image corresponding to the condition in rough approaching as seen in the vertical direction, because the image corresponding to the condition in rough approaching obtained by the probe rough-approaching image forming device 10a needs to include a plurality of the probes 3 which need to be approached each other and horizontally positioned over respective areas of the specimen so that at least one electric characteristic of the specimen is detected from the areas of the specimen after the probes 3 are brought into contact with the areas of the specimen respectively. Each of the probes is moved downwardly to a position adjacent to the specimen while monitoring the image corresponding to the condition in rough approaching as seen in the horizontal direction, and the probes are moved to be adjacent to each other and be separated from each other with a slight distance therebetween or thereamong as seen in the vertical direction. Subsequently, each of the probes is brought into contact with the respective one of the areas of the specimen by moving downwardly each of the probes while monitoring a difference between a focusing condition of each of the probes and a focusing condition of the corresponding one of the areas of the specimen to be decreased in an image as seen in the vertical direction formed by the electronic optical device 4, that is, while monitoring a focusing position of the electronic optical device 4 at which each of the probes is focused and a focusing position of the electronic optical device 4 at which the corresponding one of the areas of the specimen or an area closely adjacent to the corresponding one of the areas of the specimen is focused. If a distance between each of the probes and the corresponding one of the areas of the specimen is made as small as possible before the downward movement of each of the probes on the basis of the image formed by the electronic optical device 4, a time period for the downward movement of each of the probes for the contact between each of the probe and the corresponding one of the areas of the specimen on the basis of the image formed by the electronic optical device 4 can be small to decrease an amount of the charged particle beam with which the specimen is irradiated by the electronic optical device 4. Therefore, the magnification of the probe rough-approaching image forming device 10b is made higher than the magnification of the probe rough-approaching image forming device 10a to improve an accuracy for measuring a positional relationship between each of the probes and the corresponding one of the areas of the specimen.",

When an electric characteristic of the specimen 2a is measured, the specimen 2a is preferably isolated electrically from the specimen stage 50 and the specimen chamber 7. Further, for preventing the effect of the charging up, a beam blanking is effective. For the electrical insulation, as shown in FIG. 9, an insulating member 18 is arranged between the specimen holder receiver 17 and the z table 63, the specimen holder receiver 17 with the specimen 2a thereon is connected to a cable 20, and the cable 20 extends from the fixing member 47 through the plate 71 to an outside of the vacuumed environment so that the cable 20 is connected to a grounded terminal through a switch 19. By this structure, during the SEM monitoring, the specimen 2a is grounded by operating the switch 19 to prevent the effect caused by the noise. Further, by connecting the cable 20 through the switch 19 not to the ground but to an electric characteristic measuring device, the electric characteristic of the specimen 2a such as absorption current or the like is measurable without the effect of the noise from the specimen stage 50 and the specimen chamber 7. Further, the specimen holder receiver 17 may includes a guard electrode and a grounded electrode similarly to the probe units 33 and the probe holders 31 as shown in FIG. 5, so that the cable is connected through the three phase coaxial cable to the outside of the vacuumed environment. Therefore, the electric isolation for the specimen 2a is improved.",
        "(b) base table 49",
        "With making reference to FIG. 10, a process for positioning the specimen 2a and the probes 3 in the specimen chamber is explained.",
        "As shown in FIG. 6, the base table 49 includes the Y table 64 and X table 65 to be positioned in y and x directions respectively. The stage 50 and each of the prove holders 31 are mounted on the base table 49 to adjust and fix the positional relationship between the specimen 2a and each of the probes on the base table 49.",
        "On the base table 49, the probe units 33 forming the probe stage 6, the probe unit base 34 for supporting the probe units 33 and the probe unit bracket 35 are mounted. Each of the prove units 33 can position the probe in y, x and z directions through the prove holder 31 supported by each of the prove units 33.",
        "As shown in FIG. 10, the base table 49 is moved on the base plate 48 along a linear guide by a ball-screw and a servo motor to position briefly a combination of the specimen and the set of the probes with respect to each of the probe rough-approaching image forming device 10, the electronic optical device 4 and the probe exchange chamber 9. The Y table 64 and X table 65 of the base table 49 position accurately the combination of the specimen and the set of the probes with respect to each of the probe rough-approaching image forming device 10, the electronic optical device 4 and the probe exchange chamber 9.",
        "Therefore, the combination of the specimen and the set of the probes are positioned to each of A position under the electronic optical device 4, B position under the probe rough-approaching image forming device 10 and C position under the probe exchange chamber 9 while the vacuumed environment surrounding the combination of the specimen and the set of the probes is being kept during the movement of the combination of the specimen and the set of the probes among the A, B and C positions within the specimen chamber.",
        "(3) SEM",
        "The SEM arranged on the upper portion of the specimen chamber is an example of the electronic optical device 4 for monitoring the positional relationship between each of the probes (each of the contact areas of the proves) and the corresponding one of the electrodes of the specimen to bring each of the probes in contact with the corresponding one of the electrodes of the specimen. The vacuuming operation for the SEM is performed by the ion pump 44. On the other hand, the probe rough-approaching image forming device 10 including the optical microscope monitors the positional relationship between each of the probes and the corresponding one of the electrodes of the specimen without irradiating the specimen to bring each of the probes to a position close to the corresponding one of the electrodes of the specimen with making a distance (more than zero) between each of the probes and the corresponding one of the electrodes of the specimen as small as possible.",
        "(4) Specimen Chamber 7",
        "The specimen chamber 4 includes an upper cover and a specimen chamber case as the frame, the base 48 is attached to the plate 71 through the fixing member 47 at the side surface of the specimen chamber case, the probe units 33 are mounted on the base table 49 in the specimen chamber, and the specimen exchange chamber 8 is attached to another side surface of the specimen chamber case. The probe rough-approaching image forming device 10, the electronic optical device 4 and the probe exchange chamber 9 are mounted on the upper cover. The specimen chamber 7 is fixed to a bearing plate mounted on a vibration absorbing mount on the bracket 25. The specimen chamber 7 is vacuumed by the turbo molecular pump (TMP) 11 and the dry pump (DP) 12.",
        "(5) Optical Microscope for Rough-Approaching, CCD Camera and Rough-Approaching Image Forming Device",
        "The specimen 2a whose electrical characteristic needs to be measured is a semiconductor including plugs generally connected a gate, a source, a drain and a well respectively to be connected by the probes respectively. The plug may have a minimum diameter of tens of nanometers, so that a SEM with high resolution is necessary for bringing the probe into contact with the plug. However, by irradiating the semiconductor specimen with the electron and/or ion beam, there is a probability of that the semiconductor specimen is damaged, so that it is preferable for a time period of irradiating the semiconductor specimen with the electron and/or ion beam to be made as short as possible. Therefore, on the basis of the image of the probe rough-approaching image forming device 10 displayed on the image display part 15, a distance between each of the probes and corresponding one of the plugs (electrodes) of the specimen as seen in the thickness direction of the semiconductor specimen is made as small as possible or preferably zero, and a gap or clearance therebetween as seen in a direction perpendicular to the thickness direction is made as small as possible but is prevented from being zero. This operation is performed while an image showing the positional relationship between the probes and the specimen surface as obtained by the probe rough-approaching optical microscope and the CCD camera attached thereto and displayed on the image display portion 15 is monitored.",
        "The magnification on the image display portion 15 is tens to form an image including the specimen 2a and the probes 3 adjacent to each other as close as possible.",
        "A light source is arranged in the vicinity of the probe rough-approaching optical microscope. The monitoring by the probe rough-approaching optical microscope and CCD camera and the light supply from the light source into the specimen chamber is performed through a window aperture 39 as shown in FIG. 1.",
        "(6) Specimen Exchange Chamber 8",
        "The specimen exchange chamber 8 is arranged to exchange the specimen 2a while keeping the environment vacuum condition surrounding the specimen 2a in the specimen chamber 7 and vacuumed by the dry pump 52. The specimen exchange chamber 8 can be isolated fluidly from the specimen chamber 7 by the gate valve 21. When the specimen 2a is introduced into the specimen chamber 7, a male screw of a front end of an exchange bar 29 as a transfer member for the specimen 2a and the specimen holder 2 is screwed into a female screw of the specimen holder 2 with the specimen 2a thereon, the gate valve 21 is opened, and the specimen holder 2 is inserted onto the specimen holder receiver 17 attached to an upper end of the z table 63 of the specimen stage 50. When the specimen 2a is taken out of the specimen chamber, a reverse operation is performed. Therefore, a time period for the specimen exchange can be decreased.",
        "(7) Probe Exchange Chamber 9",
        "The probe exchange chamber 9 is arranged to exchange the probe 3 while keeping the environment vacuum condition surrounding the probe 3 in the specimen chamber 7 so that a time period for the probe exchange is decreased. The probe exchange chamber 9 can be isolated fluidly from the specimen chamber 7 by the gate valve 23. The probe exchange chamber 9 is vacuumed by the turbo molecular pump 51 and the dry pump 52. The turbo molecular pump 51 is used to accelerate a vacuuming operation for the probe exchange chamber 9, because if the vacuuming operation for the probe exchange chamber 9 is brought about by the dry pump 52 without the turbo molecular pump 51, a great volume of the probe exchange chamber 9 in which a pressure cannot be decreased sufficiently within a short time period by the dry pump 52 without the turbo molecular pump 51 causes a great increase of the inner pressure of the specimen chamber 7 when the gate valve 23 is opened to exchange the probe 3 so that a time period for making the pressure in the specimen chamber 7 at the same value as the previous pressure before opening the gate valve 23 becomes long.",
        "In the probe exchange chamber 9, a stocker (not shown) for holding the probe holders 31 is arranged and moved by a ball-screw with respect to a probe exchange bar 92. The probe holder 31 is moved below the probe exchange bar 92 to be withdrawn from the stocker or contained in the stocker. A latch key 96 at a lower end of an exchange rod 94 arranged in a probe exchange bar outer tube 93 coaxial with the probe exchange bar 92 is rotated by 90 degrees to engage with a latch receiver 95 on the probe holder 31 to be connected to the probe exchange bar 92. The exchange rod 94 is rotated by 90 degrees in a reverse direction to disengage the latch key 96 from the latch receiver 95. The stocker including the used probe holders 31 is taken out of the probe exchange chamber 9, and unused ones of the probe holders 31 are inserted onto the stocker to be introduced into the probe exchange chamber 9.",
        "When the probe holder 31 is transferred from the stocker to the probe unit 33, the latch key 96 of the probe exchange rod 94 is engaged with the latch receiver 95 on the probe holder 31, and the probe exchange bar 92 is moved upward by a rack-and-pinion mechanism to withdraw the probe holder 31 from the stocker. The gate valve 23 is opened and the probe exchange bar 92 is moved downward to introduce the probe holder 31 into the specimen chamber. As shown in FIG. 5, the holder receiver is arranged on the z table 83 of the probe unit 33. The base table 49 is driven to move the holder receiver below the transferred probe holder 31, the probe exchange bar 92 is rotated to make orientations of the holder receiver and the probe holder 31 consistent with each other, and the exchange bar 92 is moved downward to insert the probe holder 31 into the holder receiver. The latch key 96 is disengaged from the latch receiver 95, the probe exchange bar 92 is moved upward to be withdrawn into the probe exchange chamber 9, and the gate valve 23 is closed.",
        "2. Control System",
        "The SEM, the probe units 33 and the tables of the stages are controlled by respective control circuits and computers contained by the control device 13. The SEM, the probe units 33 and the tables of the stages are controllable from a operating panel or GUI on the monitor.",
        "The control device 13 includes a stage controller for controlling the tables of the stages, and a probe controller for controlling the probe units 33 independent of the stages. The image control part 16 includes a secondary electron detector control part, a control part for the electron beam emitting optical system and so forth. In addition, a calculation treatment part has a function of displaying an image showing the specimen holder, the specimen 2a and the positional relationship between the proves and the specimen 2a.",
        "The probe units 33 and the tables of the stages are driven by operating an operating display of the image display part to supply an operating signal through the image display control part to the probe unit control part and the stage control part. Alternatively, an operating panel including a joy-stick may be used to drive the units 33 and the tables of the stages.",
        "(1) SEM",
        "The electron beam generated by an electron gun is emitted through a condensing lens and an objective lens to the specimen 2a to be irradiated, and the secondary electron generated from the specimen 2a is detected by the secondary electron detector to generate a signal so that the signal is electrically treated variously in the display to form an image of the specimen surface on the monitor on the image display part 15 of the display device 14.",
        "(2) Probe unit 33",
        "A signal for controlling each of the operations of the x, y and z tables of each of the probe units 33 from the control circuit 13 in the bracket 25 as shown in FIG. 1 is supplied to each of the probe units 33 in the specimen chamber 7 through a feed-through attached the plate 71 of the stages. Input signals supplied to the specimen 2a through the probes 3 attached to the probe holders 31 and output signals generated from the specimen 2a are transmitted with respect to a semiconductor parameter analyzer through a three phase coaxial hermetic connector attached to the specimen chamber 7.",
        "(3) Stages",
        "Signals generated by the control circuit in the bracket 25 to control the operations of the x, y and z tables 61, 62 and 63 of the specimen stage 50 on the base plate 49 are supplied to the specimen stage 50 in the specimen chamber through the feed-through attached to the plate 71. Signals for controlling the operations of the x and y tables 64 and 65 are also supplied to the base plate 49 through the feed-through attached to the plate 71.",
        "3. Display Device 14",
        "The display device 14 displays a rough-approaching image taken by the probe rough-approaching image forming device 10, a contacting image taken by the electron optical device 4 to show a positional relationship between each of the probes and the specimen brought into contact with each other, the probe operating image and an image showing a sequence of the operating.",
        "The user operates the probes 3 and the specimen 2a to be positioned accurately with respect to each other along the sequence of the operating displayed on the display device 14, while monitoring the rough-approaching image and the contacting image.",
        "As shown in FIG. 12A, the rough-approaching image taken by the probe rough-approaching image forming device 10A shows the positional relationship between each the probes and the specimen as seen in the thickness direction of the specimen with the magnification of, for example, 10. As shown in FIG. 12B, the rough-approaching image taken by the probe rough-approaching image forming device 10B shows the positional relationship between each the probes and the specimen as seen in the direction perpendicular to the thickness direction of the specimen with the magnification of, for example, 25 increased by 2.5 times in comparison with the magnification of the rough-approaching image taken by the probe rough-approaching image forming device 10A to enable a distance between each of the probes 3 and the specimen 2a as seen in the direction perpendicular to the thickness direction of the specimen to be made as small as possible but to be prevented from decreasing to zero. As shown in FIG. 12C, the contacting image taken by the electron optical device 4 shows the positional relation ship between each of the probes 3 (each of the contact areas of the probes) and the corresponding one of the electrodes or plugs 100 of the specimen 2a to be brought into contact with each other, with the magnification of thousands to ten-thousands. The electrodes or plugs 100 are connected respectively to the gate, source, drain and so forth in the specimen 2a.",
