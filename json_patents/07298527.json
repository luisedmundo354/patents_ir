    "description": [
        "The present invention relates to a technique for printing in accordance with data described in a page description language (PDL).",
        "As one of prevalent PDLs, PostScript (which is a registered trademark of Adobe Systems Corporation, U.S., and will be abbreviated as \u201cPS\u201d hereinafter) is known. PS Levels 1 and 2 are older versions, and PS Level 3 is introduced as the current version. With PS Levels 1 and 2, three different color spaces RGB, CMYK, and Gray are selectable, and one of these color spaces used is obtained by interpreting a description in print data.",
        "Therefore, a printer determines which of DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, and DeviceGray is used, converts input signals into C (Cyan), M (Magenta), Y (Yellow), and K (Black) on a printer color space by a simple process according to the determination result, and then executes a print process, as shown in FIG. 1. For example, in the case of DeviceRGB, i.e., RGB signals (Red, Green, and Blue), an inverse unit (101) inverses the RGB signals into CMY signals, which undergo an Under-Color Removal (UCR) process and Black Generation (BG) process in a UCR & BG unit (102), thus generating CMYK signals. In case of DeviceCMYK, i.e., CMYK signals, since this color space is the same as the output printer space, the CMYK signals are directly output without any process. Furthermore, in the case of DeviceGray, i.e., one Gray color, since the luminance and density are inverted, the Gray signal is inverted by an inverse unit (103) to generate a K component, i.e., CMYK signals including only the K component, thus making a print process.",
        "On the other hand, PS Level 3 allows one to apply a color management process to DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, or DeviceGray upon outputting by designating a UseCIEColor parameter. That is, if the UseCIEColor parameter is \u201ctrue\u201d, a color processing flow shown in FIG. 2 is applied; if it is \u201cfalse\u201d, the process shown in FIG. 1 is applied.",
        "The color management process shown in FIG. 2 will be described below. In the case of DeviceRGB, an RGB Source Profile, which is set in advance, is selected, and DeviceRGB is converted into an XYZ color space (204), which is normalized to specify colors, using the selected profile. The XYZ color space is converted into CMYK values in accordance with an Output Profile (205) as a profile which stores information about an appropriate combination of CMYK values to output that XYZ color space. In this way, the printer outputs input RGB signals to have correct values in terms of chromaticity.",
        "DeviceCMYK inputs are converted into the XYZ color space (204) using a CMYK Simulation Profile (202), which is set in advance. Also, DeviceGray inputs are converted into the XYZ color space (204) using a Gray Profile (203) which is pre-stored in a device. Since the conversion process from the converted XYZ color space (204) into CMYK values is the same as that for DeviceRGB, description thereof will be omitted.",
        "Actual flows of respective signals will be explained below using FIG. 8. When the UseCIEColor parameter=true, DeviceRGB is converted into CIEBasedABC or CIEBasedDEF, DeviceCMYK is converted into CIEBasedDEFG, and DeviceGray is converted into CIEBasedA. Also, these color spaces are converted into the XYZ color space as the intermediate color space of PS color management. Next, the XYZ color space is converted into CMYK values according to setups of the Output Profile (205).",
        "As can be seen from FIG. 8, a larger number of conversion processes than in the process shown in FIG. 1 for PS Level 1 or 2 are required, and a longer calculation time is required. Especially, in the case of an image with a large bitmap, individual pixels must undergo such conversion processes, thus taking more time.",
        "Color management of PS Level 3 shown in FIG. 2 is not switched for respective objects which are categorized to Text, Graphics, Image, and the like, and black, e.g., R=G=B=N %, C=Y=M=N %, or K=N % (N=0% to 100%), is normally converted into process black as a combination of four colors C, M, Y, and K, which represent a chromaticity value optimal to a printer by color management.",
        "As described above, the UseCIEColor parameter is normally set \u201ctrue\u201d. Upon outputting even an image that appears to be a monochrome image on the screen, to a color printer, it is reproduced using process black as a combination of four color components C, M, Y, and K by color management, i.e., such image is normally output as a color image.",
        "Therefore, an image, graphics, and text, which are created or input by the user as monochrome ones on the screen of a host computer, are output as a color image, graphics, and text. Graphic Arts users who preferably use PS and place importance on color tincture in color management are rarely dissatisfied with the outputs being color outputs, and no problem is posed.",
        "However, due to the spread of PS to offices in recent years, office users who create and print documents that mainly include text do not prefer the complicated, time-consuming color management process described above using FIG. 8, since they normally create monochrome documents and require a higher print speed rather than high color reproducibility. Also, only one UseCIEColor parameter is set for all of DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, and DeviceGray, and cannot be individually set.",
        "PS Level 3 can define a Separation color space and DeviceN color space to cope with an expensive dedicated printing machine which prints using special color agents, in addition to the above CMYK, RGB, and GRAY color spaces. For example, the user of a dedicated printing machine (e.g., an image setter or the like) uses the Separation color space to cope with colors which cannot be reproduced by basic CMYK, and the DeviceN color space to broaden the gamut by adding colors to standard CMYK colors.",
        "The Separation color space and DeviceN color space are mainly used in print processes by the dedicated printing machine, which entails a very high print cost. Therefore, test print processes are often made using a normal color printer using four colors C, M, Y, and K.",
        "As a problem posed in such case, the Separation color space and DeviceN color space are those for the dedicated printing machine with advanced functions, and cannot be directly reflected on the color space of a normal color printer that uses CMYK color agents. That is, the normal color printer cannot directly print data of the Separation color space and DeviceN color space.",
        "Hence, PS Level 3 allows a normal color printer to print data of the Separation color space and DeviceN color space by describing a substitute color space.",
        "For example, the Separation color space is defined as follows:",
        "[ /Separation\n\n\n\n\u2003(LogoGreen)\n\n\n\n\u2003/DeviceCMYK\n\n\n\n\u2003{ dup 0.84 mul\n\n\n\n\u2003exch 0.0 exch dup 0.44 mul\n\n\n\n\u2003exch 0.21 mul\n\n\n\n\u2003}\n\n\n\n] setcolorspace",
        "This description means that print data represents color \u201cLogoGreen\u201d, and its color space corresponds to a space color obtained by converting parameters described in the curled brackets { . . . } if it is expressed by the CMYK color space (substitute color space).",
        "Therefore, when the above print PS data is input, the color space of color \u201cLogoGreen\u201d is expressed by parameters of a given CMYK color space, and the values of color \u201cLogoGreen\u201d described in print data to be subsequently received are processed to indicate CMYK values on the substitute color space.",
        "A description in case of the DeviceN color space is as follows:",
        "[ /Indexed\n\n\n\n\u2003[ /DeviceN\n\n\n\n\u2003\u2003[/Cyan /Black]\n\n\n\n\u2003\u2003/DeviceCMYK\n\n\n\n\u2003\u2003{0 0 3 \u22121 roll}\n\n\n\n\u2003]\n\n\n\n\u2003255\n\n\n\n\u2003<6605 6806 6907 6B09 6C0A ...>\n\n\n\n] setcolorspace",
        "This description means that a print process is made using two color agents (cyan and black) (an example of N=2 of DeviceN), and defines conversion into a substitute color space using parameters defined in the subsequent curled brackets { . . . } when a color space expressed by these two colors is expressed by the substitute color space CMYK.",
        "As described above, PS Level 3 allows a normal CMYK printer to print by defining the Separation color space or DeviceN color space using the substitute color space.",
        "In the case of the above example of the Separation color space, since the substitute color space CMYK is used, the subsequent processing is performed under the assumption that data on the \u201cCMYK\u201d color space shown in FIG. 2 are input. The same applies to the example of the DeviceN color space (when the UseCIEColor parameter=True).",
        "Upon reception of data of the Separation color space or DeviceN color space, many color space conversions, i.e., conversion into the substitute color space, conversion of that substitute color space into the standard color space XYZ, and conversion of the color space XYZ into CMYK values based on an Output Profile of a printer, are required. Therefore, when an object to be printed is a bitmap image, since individual pixels must undergo these conversion processes, the time required for these processes is not negligible, resulting in a drop in the print throughput.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide a technique which can set even print data described in a page description language such as PostScript Level 3 that realizes high-precision color reproducibility to print mostly monochrome office documents, and can build environments optimal for respective fields of use.",
        "A method of controlling an image forming apparatus according to the present invention is, for example, a method of controlling an image forming apparatus, which converts print data into a device-independent standard color space according to a description of the print data, converts data of the standard color space into a print color space according to a profile depending on print unit, and prints the converted data, comprising: a setting step of setting whether or not a conversion process into the standard color space is skipped, and storing and holding that setup in predetermined storage means; and a control step of directly converting, when it is set in the setting step that the conversion process into the standard color space is skipped, the print data into a color space of the print unit according to the description of the print data.",
        "It is another object of the present invention to provide a technique which can implement print processes of print data expressed by the Separation color space or DeviceN color space, which are convenient for both a user who places an importance on a print speed rather than color reproducibility, and a user who wants high-precision color reproducibility.",
        "A method of controlling an image forming apparatus according to the present invention is, for example, a method of controlling an image forming apparatus which receives print data expressed by a Separation color space or DeviceN color space, converts the print data into a print color space, and prints the converted data, comprising: a setting step of setting whether or not color management is applied; a conversion step of converting the received print data expressed by the Separation color space or DeviceN color space into a substitute color space according to a description thereof; a first conversion step of converting, when it is set in the setting step that color management is applied, the color space obtained in the conversion step into a print color space via a color management process; and a second conversion step of converting, when it is set in the setting step that color management is not applied, the color space obtained in the conversion step into a print color space without any color management process.",

Custom is prepared when the user wants to create or download his or her favorite profile (upon reception of a predetermined command from a host computer, a subsequent profile is stored and held). None means that no profile is used.",
        "In case of CMYK, the user selects a profile from SWOP, EuroScale, JapanColor, Custom, and None. In case of Gray, the user sets a flag indicating whether or not a conversion process into the XYZ color space using a profile is to be inserted (if the flag is OFF, it is equivalent to None).",
        "As described above, when the user selects \u201cGraphic Arts\u201d, he or she can designate a profile to be used for each type of print data to be received.",
        "On the other hand, when the user selects \u201cOffice\u201d on the display menu in FIG. 7, the need for an individual setting process of the color space RGB, CMYK, or GRAY designated by print data can be obviated, and None is set.",
        "After the above setting/registration process, the nonvolatile memory 5 stores and holds the setting contents according to the color spaces of print data, as shown in FIG. 10. Since the nonvolatile memory 5 can hold its storage contents, a print process is done according to the previous setting contents even when the power switch of the printer is turned on again.",
        "The operation processes in this embodiment will be described below.",

        "Upon reception of DeviceRGB print data, \u201cRGB Source Profile\u201d in the nonvolatile memory 4 is loaded in step S1. The flow advances to step S2 to determine whether or not the loaded contents are \u201cNone\u201d. If it is determined that the loaded contents are \u201cNone\u201d, the flow advances to step S3 to execute a print process by converting input RGB data into CMYK data without any color management process. As shown in FIG. 3, luminance RGB data undergo an inversion process (also called LOG conversion) by an inverse unit 101 to generate density CMY data, which then undergo UCR and BG processes so as to render CMYK color component data. After that, these data are printed.",
        "If it is determined in step S2 that the contents are other than \u201cNone\u201d, the flow advances to step S4 to execute a print process by converting received RGB data into the standard color space XYZ in accordance with a profile registered in the loaded \u201cRGB Source Profile\u201d, and converting data on the XYZ color space to a device-dependent CMYK color space. As shown in FIG. 3, luminance RGB data are converted into the standard color space XYZ by a CIE Color Space XYZ converter 204, and data on the XYZ color space are converted into a CMYK color space in accordance with an Output Profile depending on a device, i.e., the printer engine by a CMYK converter 205 to generate CMYK color component data. After that, the generated data are printed.",
        "A process executed upon reception of print data expressed by DeviceCMYK will be explained below with reference to FIG. 3 and the flow chart of FIG. 5.",
        "In step S11, \u201cCMYK Simulation Profile\u201d in the nonvolatile memory 5 is loaded. It is checked in step S12 if the contents of the loaded \u201cCMYK Simulation Profile\u201d are \u201cNone\u201d.",
        "If it is determined that the contents are \u201cNone\u201d, the flow advances to step S13 to execute a print process using input CMYK data without any color management process. As shown in FIG. 3, as an example of this route, CMYK bitmap data are directly generated based on received CMYK data without the intervention of a CIE Color Space XYZ converter, and are printed.",
        "If it is determined in step S12 that the contents are other than \u201cNone\u201d, the flow advances to step S14 to execute a print process by converting received CMYK data into the standard color space XYZ in accordance with a profile registered in the loaded \u201cCMYK Simulation Profile\u201d, and then converting the data on the XYZ color space into a device-dependent CMYK color space. As shown in FIG. 3, this process corresponds to a route for converting density data CMYK into the standard color space XYZ by the CIE color Space XYZ converter 204, and then converting data on the color space XYZ into a CMYK color space in accordance with an Output Profile which depends on a device, i.e., the printer engine, by the CMYK converter 205.",
        "A process executed upon reception of print data expressed by a DeviceGray signal will be described below with reference to FIG. 3 and the flow chart of FIG. 6.",
        "In step S21, \u201cGray Profile\u201d in the nonvolatile memory 5 is loaded. It is determined in step S22 based on the loaded \u201cGray Profile\u201d if its flag is Off, i.e., if a profile is to be used.",
        "If it is determined that no gray profile is used, the flow advances to step S23 to generate density data by simply inverting input luminance component data, thus executing a print process. As shown in FIG. 3, as an example of this route, received Gray data (luminance data) is directly converted into density data by an inverse unit 103 without the intervention of a CIE Color Space XYZ converter. Note that a color component used upon printing is only a K component, and other CMY components are not used. As a result, since no chromatic color components are used, a gray print process is literally implemented.",
        "If it is determined in step S22 that the flag is ON, i.e., a Gray profile is used, the flow advances to step S24 to execute a print process by converting received gray data into the standard color space XYZ in accordance with a Gray Profile which is registered in advance, and then converting data on the XYZ color space into a device-dependent CMYK color space. As shown in FIG. 3, this process corresponds to a route for converting Gray data into the standard color space XYZ by the CIE Color Space XYZ converter 204, and converting data on the XYZ color space into a CMYK color space in accordance with an Output profile which depends on a device, i.e., the printer engine by the CMYK converter 205.",
        "As described above, according to this embodiment, PS Level 3, i.e., an advanced page description language which is particularly effective for specialized fields such as graphics arts and the like and can realize high color reproducibility, can be set to print office documents such as general monochrome documents and documents that include some bar graphs, illustrations, and the like, and do not require any artistry. Especially, most of office documents are monochrome. Hence, as long as \u201cOffice\u201d is selected (or \u201cNone\u201d is selected for each individual color space) as in this embodiment, monochrome documents can be avoided from being printed as color documents, thus reducing running cost. In case of a color laser beam printer, scan exposure processes corresponding in number to color components are required. In case of an ink-jet printer, the number of nozzles of a monochrome printhead is larger than those of color heads. Therefore, when \u201cOffice\u201d is set, a high print process speed can be assured only for a GrayScale print process. According to this embodiment, when \u201cOffice\u201d is selected as a use purpose, \u201cNone\u201d can be set for all three different color spaces designated by print data, and a user who almost exclusively creates office documents can complete a setup process by a simple operation.",
        "This embodiment has exemplified a case wherein the printer receives PS Level 3 print data (one of the RGB, CMYK, and Gray color spaces), and processes the print data according to the setup contents of user's choice.",
        "However, a host computer may execute processes until CMYK data to be finally output are generated. In this case, the setup contents of user's choice (corresponding to FIG. 10) may be saved in a hard disk or the like of the host computer, and the above processes may be implemented by a printer driver or an add-on program of a PS printer driver. That is, the scope of the present invention includes a computer program. Since a program which runs on a host computer becomes normally ready to run after a computer readable storage medium such as a CD-ROM or the like is set and the program is copied or installed in a system, such computer readable storage medium is also included in the scope of the present invention.",
        "This embodiment has exemplified PS Level 3. However, the present invention is not limited to PS Level 3 since it can be applied to any other printer description languages which convert into a device-independent standard color space to realize high color reproducibility.",
        "As described above, in this embodiment, in order to allow both office users and Graphic Arts users to select their preferred processes, means which allows the user to independently set from the console whether or not a color management process is applied to each of DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, and DeviceGray, is provided, as shown in FIG. 7, thus making setups according to the user's preference.",
        "In a personal computer, since a display device adopts an RGB color space, the RGB color space is often used unless the user selects another color space on purpose. Hence, color management=\u201cOFF\u201d is set as defaults of DeviceCMYK and DeviceGray, since such color spaces are used only when the user selects them on purpose. In this manner, only a K component signal of DeviceCMYK and a DeviceGray Signal, which appears to black on the screen, is output using one color K, which is also output by the printer. Since the time-consuming color management process in FIG. 8 can be skipped, the processing speed can be greatly increased.",
        "As for RGB, color management is indispensable to adjust the color tinctures of the monitor and output. Hence, color management=\u201cON\u201d is set as a default, i.e., a profile used in color management is selected in advance. In this manner, the color tinctures of the monitor and printouts can be adjusted.",
        "As described above, according to the embodiment of the present invention, even data of a page description language for graphic arts, which realizes advanced color reproduction, can be set to print mostly monochrome office documents, and an optimal environment to each use field can be provided.",

        "In the printer according to this embodiment with the arrangement shown in FIG. 9, the user sets and registers a use purpose using the control panel 4. FIG. 11 shows a selection menu displayed on the display of the control panel 4. This menu allows the user to set whether or not color management is applied upon reception of print data of the Separation color space or DeviceN color space. This setup is made by touching a corresponding button if the control panel 4 comprises a touch panel. Alternatively, physical switches may be used to select.",
        "In this case, when the user selects \u201cON\u201d, and data of the Separation or DeviceN color space is received, that data is converted into a substitute color space. After this conversion, processes including the color management process, i.e., conversion into the standard color space XYZ using a color profile (designated by the user) and conversion into a CMYK color space using an Output Profile, are executed, and a print process is then executed, according to the procedure shown in FIG. 2.",
        "On the other hand, when the user selects \u201cOFF\u201d and data of the Separation or DeviceN color space is received, a process for converting that data into a substitute color space is executed. However, in subsequent processes, conversion into the standard color space XYZ is skipped, and conversion into the CMYK color space is simply done to execute a print process, as shown in FIG. 1. If the substitute color space is CMYK, the subsequent conversion process can also be skipped, and a print process is directly executed.",
        "Therefore, when the user selects \u201cOFF\u201d, although slightly unintended color tinctures may be produced compared to a case wherein the user selects \u201cON\u201d, since the number of color conversion processes can be reduced (only once when the substitute color space=CMYK), a high-speed print process can be assured, and a state optimal to office documents can be provided.",
        "After the aforementioned setup process on the control panel 4, the nonvolatile memory 5 stores and holds setups (ON/OFF flags) indicating whether or not a color management process is applied to each of the Separation color space and DeviceN color space, as shown in FIG. 12. Therefore, even when the power switch of the apparatus is turned on again, a print process can be done according to the previous setting contents.",
        "The operation process of the CPU 1 of the printer of this embodiment will be described below with reference to the flow chart of FIG. 13.",
        "It is checked in steps S24 and S25 if the color space of print data received from the host computer is the Separation color space or DeviceN color space. If the color space of print data is neither of them, i.e., if it is one of DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, and DeviceGray, the flow advances to step S26 to execute a print process according to a description of PS data.",
        "If it is determined in step S24 that the received print data is data of the Separation color space, the flow advances to step S27 to make conversion into a substitute color space according to its description. The flow then advances to step S28 to load data of \u201cSeparation color management\u201d in the nonvolatile memory 5 and to check if its flag is ON or OFF, i.e., if color management is to be applied. If color management is ON, the flow advances to step S26 to execute the process in FIG. 2 to have the substitute color space as a start point. On the other hand, if it is determined in step S28 that color management is OFF, the flow advances to step S29 to check if the substitute color space is a CMYK color space. If it is determined that the substitute color space is other than the CMYK color space, the substitute color space is converted into the CMYK color space in step S30. In step S31, a print process is done according to the CMYK color space.",
        "If it is determined in step S25 that the received print data is data of the DeviceN color space, the flow advances to step S32 to make conversion into a substitute color space according to its description. Next, data of \u201cDeviceN color management\u201d in the nonvolatile memory 5 is loaded to check if its flag is ON or OFF, i.e., if color management is to be applied. If color management is ON, the flow advances to step S26 to execute the process in FIG. 2 to have the substitute color space as a start point.",
        "If it is designated that the color management process is OFF, the flow advances to step S34 to check if the substitute color space is a CMYK color space.

In step S36, a print process is done according to the CMYK color space.",
        "As described above, according to this embodiment, when a page description language such as PS Level 3 designates the Separation color space or DeviceN color space as a special color space different from normal color spaces, a print process can be done while skipping color management according to user's setups. Hence, the print process can be simplified, resulting in a high print process speed.",
        "The above embodiment has exemplified a case wherein the print data is data of the Separation color space or DeviceN color space. When data of DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, or DeviceGray is received and UseCIEColor=true, the sequence shown in FIG. 2 is executed unconditionally.",
        "However, even a versatile color space such as DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, DeviceGray, or the like is converted into the standard color space XYZ, and the XYZ color space is then converted into a CMYK color space using an output profile. Hence, at least two color space conversion processes are required. Such function is unnecessary for a user who wants to print mostly monochrome office documents at high speed. In other words, such function is required for a user who principally prints graphics arts.",
        "Hence, according to the third embodiment, whether or not color management is applied can be set not only for the Separation color space and DeviceN color space but also for print data of DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, and DeviceGray.",
        "In this case, a selection menu is displayed on the control panel 4, as shown in, e.g., FIG. 7, to prompt to the user to select one of \u201cOffice\u201d and \u201cGraphic Arts\u201d as a use purpose.",
        "More specifically, two choices, i.e., \u201cOffice\u201d suited to a case wherein office documents that do not require high color reproducibility are normally printed, and \u201cGraphic Arts\u201d that can print graphics arts and the like with high color reproducibility, are prepared, and the user selects one of them.",
        "When the user selects \u201cOffice\u201d, color management is applied to none of the Separation color space, DeviceN color space, DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, and DeviceGray.

        "As described above, according to the third embodiment, for a user other than specialized fields such as graphics arts and the like, the number of color space conversion processes is reduced upon printing independently of the color space of input print data. Hence, a high print process speed can be assured.",

        "As described above, according to the above embodiments, office users are often satisfied with the colors of a substitute color space, and the color management processing time can be saved accordingly. On the other hand, since Graphic Arts users require color reproduction faithful to an original, color management is applied to meet such requirement.",
