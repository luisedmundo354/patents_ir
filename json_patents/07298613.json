        "Portable computers are compact, lightweight computing devices and may comprise any portable electronic device, for example, notebook computers, personal digital assistants, tablet personal computers, and laptop computers. Although designed for portability and mobile uses, many people use portable computers in desktop environments. The use of portable computers in desktop environments has always created challenges with ergonomics and ease of use. Many of the features that make portable computers useful mobile tools, such as compact size and integrated components, can be limitations when used in a desktop environment.",
        "Portable computer docking stations have been developed to ease the use of a portable computer in a desktop environment. Many of these docking stations provide interfaces with peripheral equipment, for example, input devices, networks, printers, and additional display devices, that allows the portable computer to be more easily used as a desktop system. Certain pieces of peripheral equipment, such as additional displays and input devices, enable more ergonomic use of a portable computer but are redundant to components integral to the portable computer. These redundant components not only increase hardware investment but also often occupy a large amount of desktop space.",
        "Therefore, as can be appreciated, there is a need for a portable computer docking station that enables ergonomic use of a portable computer while limiting the use of desktop space. The problems noted above are solved in large part by a portable computer docking station comprising a base and a panel rotatably connected to the base. An angle is formed between the base and the panel. A mounting point is disposed on the panel and provides a releasable connection to an interface assembly that is operable to releasably connect to a portable computer. An adjusting system controls the angle of the panel relative to the base.",

Computer 54 is coupled to interface assembly 20 by interface 48 and supported by shoulders 40 on panel 14. Connecting cables 56 can be routed through cable slot 30 and tray 44 to couple to ports 52 on assembly 20. Adjustment mechanism 18 can be actuated by pulling on one, or both, of handles 42 such that panel 14 can be rotated about hinge 16 to a desired working elevation. Although shown as configured for a notebook computer system, computer docking station 10 may also be configured for use as a docking station for a variety of portable computer systems.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 5, adjustment mechanism 18 is shown comprising handles 42, actuation cables 58, and latch 60. Latch 60 comprises actuation arms 66, engaging arm 68, and biasing spring 70. Handles 42 comprise cable attachment bar 72 and springs 74. Adjustment mechanism 18 is used to limit the rotation of panel 14 about hinge 16. Hinge 16 comprises shaft 62 that has ends 64 retained in outer hinge mounts 28. Shaft 62 also has splined section 64 that is aligned with latch 60.",
        "Biasing spring 70 urges engaging arm 68 against splined section 64 by rotating latch 60 about pivot 76. Engaging arm 68 has teeth 78 that engage splined section 64 and prevent rotation of shaft 62. When one, or both, of handles 42 are pulled outward, springs 74 compress and tension is applied to actuation cables 58. Actuation cables 58 transfer this tension to actuation arms 66, which, when pulled, cause latch 60 to rotate. As latch 60 rotates, biasing spring 70 is compressed and teeth 78 disengage splined section 64, enabling panel 14 to rotate relative to shaft 62.",
        "Panel 14 can be rotated to any desired position. Once panel 14 is positioned, handles 42 are released and adjustment system 18 maintains the position of panel 14. The release of handles 42 enables springs 74 to retract the handles and relieve tension from actuating cables 58. Without the tension from actuating cables 58, biasing spring 70 rotates latch 60 back towards its initial position and engaging arm 68 engages shaft 72. The interface between teeth 78 and splined section 64 prevents rotation of shaft 72 relative to panel 14.",
        "Adjustment system 18 is one embodiment of a system for angular adjustment of panel 14 relative to base 12. Other one-hand and two-hand actuated systems may be used. Adjustment system 18 facilitates movement of panel 14 from substantially parallel to base 12 to an incline of between 0 and approximately 45 degrees, or more. Other ranges of inclination are also possible.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 6, portable computer docking station 10 is shown with an alternate computer interface assembly 80 installed. Computer interface assembly is illustrated as an advanced port replicator that provides increased functionality over the port replicator as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. Interface assembly 80 also comprises an electronic interface 48 that couples to a portable computer. Assembly 80 may mount to panel 14 using any effective connector and is shown as having slots 82 that engage mounting points 38. In this manner, mounting points 38 can be used to support a variety docking stations, port replicators, and other interface assemblies as desired, thus providing flexibility in the use of computer docking station 10.",
        "The above discussion is meant to be illustrative of the principles and various embodiments of the present invention. Numerous variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art once the above disclosure is fully appreciated. For example, an adjustable computer docking station may be configured for use with a variety of portable computers, for example, other types of notebook systems, notepad systems, personal digital assistants, and other equipment."
