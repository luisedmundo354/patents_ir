    "description": [
        "In the manufacture of certain bonded non-woven products, the use of topical binders to impart added strength to the final product is well known. An example of such a process is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,879,257 entitled \u201cAbsorbent Unitary Laminate-Like Fibrous Webs and Method for Producing Them\u201d and issued Apr. 22, 1975 to Gentile et al., herein incorporated by reference. A problem associated with commercially available topical binders is that they require a highly elevated curing temperature to impart the desired strength, which in turn requires a curing oven or equivalent apparatus. These requirements add to the capital and manufacturing costs associated with the product. Also, some commercially available binders can emit hazardous air pollutants, such as formaldehyde, and the resulting product can exhibit an undesirable odor, particularly when wetted.",
        "An improved binder system is disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/654,556 entitled \u201cLow Odor Binders Curable at Room Temperature\u201d filed Sep. 2, 2003 by Goulet et al. This binder system utilizes a mixture of an epoxy-reactive polymer and an epoxy-functional polymer. However, there remains a need to continually improve upon binder systems useful for the commercial production of paper towels, for example.",
        "It now has been discovered that binder systems involving the reaction between an azetidinium-reactive polymer and an azetidinium-functional cross-linking polymer, when topically applied to a fibrous web such as a paper web, particularly a tissue or paper towel basesheet, can cure at ambient or low temperature without emitting formaldehyde and without imparting objectionable odors to the resulting product. Furthermore, such binder systems exhibit additional commercial advantages, such as viscosity stability, ease of use and low cost. Specifically, these binder systems retain a low viscosity value for a prolonged period of time (weeks) compared to other low temperature cure binder systems which significantly increase in viscosity after several hours, which makes application of the binder more difficult. Regarding ease of use, the azetidinium-functional cross-linking polymer does not require an activation step using a strong base as is needed with some other binder systems, which makes it easier to prepare, safer to handle and reduces overall binder cost. Further in regard to cost, azetidinium-functional cross-linking polymers can be considerably less expensive than epoxy-functional resins due to the existing large commercial market for azetidinium-functional cross-linking polymers as wet end additives for paper.",
        "Without being bound by theory, it is hypothesized that during and after drying of the paper web, the functional moiety on the latex polymer reacts with the azetidinium-functional reactant to form a covalently bonded polymer network. Simultaneously, it is also hypothesized that the azetidinium-functional reactant can also react with carboxylic acid or other functional groups present on the fiber surface to provide additional strengthening of the basesheet. In addition, for poly(aminoamide)-epichlorohydrin resins, the azetidinium functional group can self-crosslink with amine functional groups present on the resin. In addition, and also simultaneously, for binder formulations that contain cross-linking additives designed to reduce blocking, these cross-linking additives are activated during the thermal drying step and can react both with the latex polymer and/or the nonwoven basesheet fibers to hold the polymer in place and reduce its ability to flow and increase blocking resistance characteristics of the bonded basesheet.",
        "Hence, in one aspect the invention resides in an aqueous binder composition comprising an unreacted mixture of an azetidinium-reactive polymer and an azetidinium-functional cross-linking polymer, wherein the amount of the azetidinium-functional cross-linking polymer relative to the amount of the azetidinium-reactive polymer is from about 0.5 to about 25 dry weight percent on a solids basis.",
        "In another aspect, the invention resides in a method of increasing the strength of a fibrous web comprising topically applying an aqueous binder composition to one or both outer surfaces of the web, wherein the binder composition comprises an unreacted mixture of an azetidinium-reactive polymer and an azetidinium-functional cross-linking polymer, wherein the amount of the azetidinium-functional cross-linking polymer relative to the amount of the azetidinium-reactive polymer is from about 0.5 to about 25 dry weight percent on a solids basis. The treated web can thereafter be optionally creped.",
        "In another aspect, the invention resides in a fibrous web or sheet having first and second outer surfaces, wherein at least one outer surface comprises a topically-applied network of a cured binder composition resulting from the cross-linking reaction of an azetidinium-reactive polymer and an azetidinium-functional cross-linking polymer. As used herein, the term \u201cnetwork\u201d is used to describe any binder pattern that serves to bond the sheet together. The pattern can be regular or irregular and can be continuous or discontinuous.",
        "Products incorporating the fibrous webs of this invention can be single-ply or multi-ply (two, three, or more plies). The binder composition can be applied to one or more surfaces of the ply or plies within the product. For example, a single-ply product can have one or both surfaces treated with the binder composition. A two-ply product can have one or both outer surfaces treated with the binder composition and/or one or both inner surfaces treated with the binder composition. In the case of a two-ply product, it can be advantageous to have one or both binder-treated surfaces plied inwardly in order to expose the untreated surface(s) of the plies on the outside of the product for purposes of hand-feel or absorbency. When the binder is applied to the inner surfaces of a multi-ply product, the binder also provides a means of bonding the plies together. In such cases, mechanical bonding may not be required. In the case of a three-ply product, the same options are available. In addition, for example, it may be desirable to provide a center ply which is not treated with binder while the two outer plies are treated with binder as described above.",
        "As used herein, a \u201cpolymer\u201d is a macromolecule consisting of at least five monomer units. More particularly, the degree of polymerization, which is the number of monomer units in an average polymer unit for a given sample, can be about 10 or greater, more specifically about 30 or greater, more specifically about 50 or greater and still more specifically from about 10 to about 10,000.",
        "Azetidinium-reactive polymers suitable for use in accordance with this invention are those polymers containing functional pendant groups that will react with azetidinium-functional molecules. Such reactive functional groups include carboxyl groups, amines and others. Particularly suitable azetidinium-reactive polymers include carboxyl-functional latex emulsion polymers. More particularly, carboxyl-functional latex emulsion polymers useful in accordance with this invention can comprise aqueous emulsion addition copolymerized unsaturated monomers, such as ethylenic monomers, polymerized in the presence of surfactants and initiators to produce emulsion-polymerized polymer particles. Unsaturated monomers contain carbon-to-carbon double bond unsaturation and generally include vinyl monomers, styrenic monomers, acrylic monomers, allylic monomers, acrylamide monomers, as well as carboxyl functional monomers. Vinyl monomers include vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate and similar vinyl lower alkyl esters, vinyl halides, vinyl aromatic hydrocarbons such as styrene and substituted styrenes, vinyl aliphatic monomers such as alpha olefins and conjugated dienes, and vinyl alkyl ethers such as methyl vinyl ether and similar vinyl lower alkyl ethers. Acrylic monomers include lower alkyl esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid having an alkyl ester chain from one to twelve carbon atoms as well as aromatic derivatives of acrylic and methacrylic acid. Useful acrylic monomers include, for instance, methyl, ethyl, butyl, and propyl acrylates and methacrylates, 2-ethyl hexyl acrylate and methacrylate, cyclohexyl, decyl, and isodecyl acrylates and methacrylates, and similar various acrylates and methacrylates.",
        "In accordance with this invention, the carboxyl-functional latex emulsion polymer can contain copolymerized carboxyl-functional monomers such as acrylic and methacrylic acids, fumaric or maleic or similar unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, where the preferred carboxyl monomers are acrylic and methacrylic acid. The carboxyl-functional latex polymers comprise by weight from about 1% to about 50% copolymerized carboxyl monomers with the balance being other copolymerized ethylenic monomers. Preferred carboxyl-functional polymers include carboxylated vinyl acetate-ethylene terpolymer emulsions such as Airflex\u00ae 426 Emulsion, commercially available from Air Products Polymers, LP.",
        "Suitable azetidinium-functional cross-linking polymers include polyamide-epichlorohydrin (PAE) resins, polyamide-polyamine-epichlorohydrin (PPE) resins, polydiallylamine-epichlorohydrin resins and other such resins generally produced via the reaction of an amine-functional polymer with an epihalohydrin. Many of these resins are described in the text \u201cWet Strength Resins and Their Applications\u201d, chapter 2, pages 14-44, TAPPI Press (1994), herein incorporated by reference.",
        "The relative amounts of the azetidinium-reactive polymer and the azetidinium-functional cross-linking polymer will depend on the number of functional groups (degree of functional group substitution on molecule) present on each component. In general, it has been found that properties desirable for a disposable paper towel, for example, are achieved when the level of azetidinium-reactive polymer exceeds that of the azetidinium-functional cross-linking polymer on a dry solids basis. More specifically, on a dry solids basis, the amount of azetidinium-functional cross-linking polymer relative to the amount of azetidinium-reactive polymer can be from about 0.5 to about 25 weight percent, more specifically from about 1 to about 20 weight percent, still more specifically from about 2 to about 10 weight percent and still more specifically from about 5 to about 10 weight percent. Other applications may require higher levels of azetidinium-functional cross-linking polymer to achieve desired end use properties.",
        "The surface area coverage of the binder composition on the fibrous web can be about 5 percent or greater, more specifically about 30 percent or greater, still more specifically from about 5 to about 90 percent, and still more specifically from about 20 to about 75 percent. The binder composition can be applied to one or both surfaces of the fibrous web by any suitable method such as printing, spraying, coating, foaming and the like.",
        "Curing temperatures for the binder composition can be about 260\u00b0 C. or less, more specifically about 120\u00b0 C. or less, more specifically about 100\u00b0 C. or less, more specifically about 40\u00b0 C. or less, more specifically from about 10 to about 260\u00b0 C. and still more specifically from about 20 to about 120\u00b0 C. It will be appreciated that although the binder compositions of this invention can be cured at relatively low temperatures, the rate of curing can be accelerated at higher temperatures associated with curing conventional binders. However, such higher cure temperatures are not necessary with the binder compositions of this invention.",
        "The \u201cwet/dry ratio\u201d for paper towels in accordance with this invention, which is the ratio of the CD wet tensile strength divided by the CD dry tensile strength for a given towel sample, can be about 0.40 or greater, more specifically from about 0.40 to about 0.70, and still more specifically from about 0.45 to about 0.65.",
        "Although the binder compositions of this invention have very desirable anti-blocking characteristics, the binder compositions of this invention can optionally contain anti-blocking additives designed to modify the surface chemistry or characteristics of the binder film on the basesheet. Suitable anti-blocking additives include: 1) chemically reactive additives, such as multifunctional aldehydes, including glyoxal, glutaraldehyde and glyoxalated polyacrylamides designed to increase the level of crosslinking of the latex polymer immediately after drying the web; 2) non-reactive additives, such as silicones, waxes, oils, designed to modify the surface chemistry of at least one outer surface of the web to reduce blocking; and 3) soluble or insoluble crystals, such as sugars, talc, clay and the like, designed to reside on the surface of the binder film and thus reduce its propensity to cause blocking to an adjacent web surface. The amount of the anti-blocking additive in the binder composition, relative to the amount of azetidinium-reactive polymer on a weight percent solids basis, can be from about 1 to about 25 percent, more specifically from about 5 to about 20 percent and more specifically from about 10 to about 15 percent.",
        "The effectiveness of an anti-blocking additive can be measured in accordance with the Blocking Test (hereinafter defined). Blocking test values for fibrous sheets, particularly paper towels, in accordance with this invention can be about 23 grams (force) or less, more specifically about 20 grams (force) or less, more specifically from about 1 to about 23 grams (force) and still more specifically from about 1 to about 15 grams (force).",
        "As used herein, the \u201cmachine direction (MD) tensile strength\u201d represents the peak load per sample width when a sample is pulled to rupture in the machine direction. In comparison, the cross-machine direction (CD) tensile strength represents the peak load per sample width when a sample is pulled to rupture in the cross-machine direction. Unless specified otherwise, tensile strengths are dry tensile strengths.",
        "Samples for tensile strength testing are prepared by cutting a 3 inches (76.2 mm) wide\u00d75 inches (127 mm) long strip in either the machine direction (MD) or cross-machine direction (CD) orientation using a JDC Precision Sample Cutter (Thwing-Albert Instrument Company, Philadelphia, Pa., Model No. JDC3-10, Serial No. 37333). The instrument used for measuring tensile strengths is an MTS Systems Sintech 11S, Serial No. 6233. The data acquisition software is MTS TestWorks\u00ae for Windows Ver. 3.10 (MTS Systems Corp., Research Triangle Park, N.C.). The load cell is selected from either a 50 Newton or 100 Newton maximum, depending on the strength of the sample being tested, such that the majority of peak load values fall between 10-90% of the load cell's full scale value. The gauge length between jaws is 4+/\u22120.04 inches (101.6+/\u22121 mm). The jaws are operated using pneumatic-action and are rubber coated. The minimum grip face width is 3 inches (76.2 mm), and the approximate height of a jaw is 0.5 inches (12.7 mm). The crosshead speed is 10+/\u22120.4 inches/min (254+/\u22121 mm/min), and the break sensitivity is set at 65%. The sample is placed in the jaws of the instrument, centered both vertically and horizontally. The test is then started and ends when the specimen breaks. The peak load is recorded as either the \u201cMD tensile strength\u201d or the \u201cCD tensile strength\u201d of the specimen depending on the sample being tested. At least six (6) representative specimens are tested for each product and the arithmetic average of all individual specimen tests is either the MD or CD tensile strength for the product.",
        "Wet tensile strength measurements are measured in the same manner, but are only typically measured in the cross-machine direction of the sample. Prior to testing, the center portion of the CD sample strip is saturated with room temperature tap water immediately prior to loading the specimen into the tensile test equipment. CD wet tensile measurements can be made both immediately after the product is made and also after some time of natural aging of the product. For mimicking natural aging, experimental product samples are stored at ambient conditions of approximately 23\u00b0 C. and 50% relative humidity for up to 15 days or more prior to testing so that the sample strength no longer increases with time. Following this natural aging step, the samples are individually wetted and tested. Alternatively, samples may be tested immediately after production with no additional aging time. For these samples, the tensile strips are artificially aged for 5 or 10 minutes in an oven at 105\u00b0 C. prior to testing. Following this artificial aging step, the samples are individually wetted and tested. For measuring samples that have been made more than two weeks prior to testing, which are inherently naturally aged, such conditioning is not necessary.",
        "Sample wetting is performed by first laying a single test strip onto a piece of blotter paper (Fiber Mark, Reliance Basis 120). A pad is then used to wet the sample strip prior to testing. The pad is a Scotch-Brite\u00ae brand (3M) general purpose commercial scrubbing pad. To prepare the pad for testing, a full-size pad is cut approximately 2.5 inches (63.5 mm) long by 4 inches (101.6 mm) wide. A piece of masking tape is wrapped around one of the 4 inch (101.6 mm) long edges. The taped side then becomes the \u201ctop\u201d edge of the wetting pad. To wet a tensile strip, the tester holds the top edge of the pad and dips the bottom edge in approximately 0.25 inch (6.35 mm) of tap water located in a wetting pan. After the end of the pad has been saturated with water, the pad is then taken from the wetting pan and the excess water is removed from the pad by lightly tapping the wet edge three times on a wire mesh screen. The wet edge of the pad is then gently placed across the sample, parallel to the width of the sample, in the approximate center of the sample strip. The pad is held in place for approximately one second and then removed and placed back into the wetting pan. The wet sample is then immediately inserted into the tensile grips so the wetted area is approximately centered between the upper and lower grips. The test strip should be centered both horizontally and vertically between the grips. (It should be noted that if any of the wetted portion comes into contact with the grip faces, the specimen must be discarded and the jaws dried off before resuming testing.) The tensile test is then performed and the peak load recorded as the CD wet tensile strength of this specimen. As with the dry tensile tests, the characterization of a product is determined by the average of six representative sample measurements.",
        "In addition to tensile strength, stretch is also reported by the MTS TestWorks\u00ae for Windows Ver. 3.10 program for each sample measured. Stretch is reported as a percentage and is defined as the ratio of the slack-corrected elongation of a specimen at the point it generates its peak load divided by the slack-corrected gage length.",

Depending upon the stability of the resulting blended binder formulation, the elapsed time between blending of the binder composition and its application to the web can be less than a week, more specifically 48 hours or less, more specifically 24 hours or less, and still more specifically about 4 hours or less.",
        "Returning to FIG. 1, a fibrous web 10 made according to any suitable wet-laying or air-laying process is passed through a first binder material application station 12. Station 12 includes a nip formed by a smooth rubber press roll 14 and a patterned rotogravure roll 16. Rotogravure roll 16 is in communication with a reservoir 18 containing a first binder material 20. The rotogravure roll applies the binder material to one side of web in a pre-selected pattern.",
        "Web 10 is then contacted with a heated roll 22 after passing a roll 24. The heated roll 22 serves to at least partially dry the web. The heated roll can be heated to a temperature, for instance, up to about 121\u00b0 C. and particularly from about 82\u00b0 C. to about 104\u00b0 C. In general, the web can be heated to a temperature sufficient to dry the web and evaporate any water. During the time the web is heated, some curing of the binder on the sheet may occur.",
        "It should be understood, that the besides the heated roll 22, any suitable heating device can be used to dry the web. For example, in an alternative embodiment, the web can be placed in communication with a through-air dryer or an infra-red heater in order to dry the web. Other heating devices can include, for instance, any suitable convective oven, microwave oven or other suitable electromagnetic wave energy source.",
        "From the heated roll 22, the web 10 can be advanced by pull rolls 26 to a second binder material application station generally 28. Station 28 includes a transfer roll 30 in contact with a rotogravure roll 32, which is in communication with a reservoir 34 containing a second binder material 36. Similar to station 12, second binder material 36 is applied to the opposite side of web 10 in a pre-selected pattern. Once the second binder material is applied, web 10 is adhered to a creping roll or drum 38 by a press roll 40. The web is carried on the surface of the creping roll for a distance and then removed therefrom by the action of a creping blade 42. The creping blade performs a controlled pattern creping operation on the second side of the paper web.",
        "In accordance with the present invention, the second binder material 36 is selected such that the web 10 can be adhered to and creped from the creping drum 38. For example, in accordance with the present invention, the creping drum can be maintained at a temperature of between 66\u00b0 C. and 121\u00b0 C. Operation outside of this range is also possible. In one embodiment, for example, the creping drum 108 can be at 104\u00b0 C. Alternatively, the creping drum need not be heated or only heated to a relatively low temperature.",
        "Once creped, the paper web 10 is pulled through a drying station 44. Drying station 44 can include any form of a heating unit, such as an oven energized by infrared heat, microwave energy, hot air or the like. Alternatively, the drying station may comprise other drying methods such as photo-curing, UV-curing, corona discharge treatment, electron beam curing, curing with reactive gas, curing with heated air such as through-air heating or impingement jet heating, infrared heating, contact heating, inductive heating, microwave or RF heating, and the like. The dryer may also include a fan to blow air onto the moving web. Drying station 44 may be necessary in some applications to dry the web and/or cure the first and second binder materials. Depending upon the binder materials selected, however, in other applications the drying station may not be needed.",
        "The amount that the paper web is heated within the drying station 44 can depend upon the particular binder materials used, the amount of binder materials applied to the web, and the type of web used. In some applications, for instance, the paper web can be heated using a gas stream such as air at a temperature of about 265\u00b0 C. in order to cure the binder materials. When using low cure temperature binder materials, on the other hand, the gas can be at a temperature lower than about 130\u00b0 C. and particularly lower than about 120\u00b0 C. In an alternative embodiment, the drying station 44 is not used to cure the binder material applied to the web. Instead, the drying station is used to dry the web and to drive off any water present in the web. In this embodiment, the web can be heated to temperatures sufficient to evaporate water, such as to a temperature of from about 90 to about 120\u00b0 C. In other embodiments, room temperature air (20-40\u00b0 C.) may be sufficient to dry the web. In still other embodiments, the drying station may be bypassed or removed from the process altogether.",
        "Once passed through drying station, web 10 can be wound into a roll of material 46 for subsequent conversion into the final product. In other embodiments, the web may proceed directly into further converting operations to result in the final product without being wound into an intermediate roll.",
        "In general, a single-ply uncreped through-air-dried (UCTAD) sheet was produced generally as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,545 issued Jan. 14, 1997 to Rugowski et al., herein incorporated by reference. After manufacture on the tissue machine, the UCTAD basesheet was printed on each side with a latex-based binder. The binder-treated sheet was adhered to the surface of a Yankee dryer to re-dry the sheet and thereafter the sheet was creped and wound onto a roll without any additional thermal curing. The resulting sheet was tested for physical properties after natural aging at room temperature (about 23\u00b0 C.) and humidity (about 50% relative humidity).",
        "More specifically, the basesheet was made from a stratified fiber furnish containing a center layer of fibers positioned between two outer layers of fibers. Both outer layers of the UCTAD basesheet contained 100% northern softwood kraft pulp and about 3.5 kilograms (kg)/metric ton (Mton) of dry fiber of a debonding agent, ProSoft\u00ae TQ1003 (Hercules, Inc.). Combined, the outer layers comprised 50% of the total fiber weight of the sheet (25% in each layer). The center layer, which comprised 50% of the total fiber weight of the sheet, was also comprised of northern softwood kraft pulp. The fibers in this layer were also treated with 3.5 kg/Mton of ProSoft\u00ae TQ1003 debonder.",
        "The machine-chest furnish containing the chemical additives was diluted to approximately 0.2 percent consistency and delivered to a layered headbox. The forming fabric speed was approximately 445 meters per minute. The resulting web was then rush-transferred to a transfer fabric (Voith Fabrics, 807) traveling 15% slower than the forming fabric using a vacuum box to assist the transfer. At a second vacuum-assisted transfer, the web was transferred and wet-molded onto the throughdrying fabric (Voith Fabrics, t1203-8). The web was dried with a through-air-dryer resulting in a basesheet with an air-dry basis weight of approximately 45 grams per square meter (gsm).",
        "The resulting sheet was fed to a gravure printing line, similar to that shown in FIG. 1, traveling at about 200 feet per minute (61 meters per minute) where a latex binder was printed onto the surface of the sheet. The first side of the sheet was printed with a bonding formulation using direct rotogravure printing. Then the printed web passed over a heated roll with a surface temperature of approximately 104\u00b0 C. to evaporate water. Next, the second side of the sheet was printed with the bonding formulation using a second direct rotogravure printer. The sheet was then pressed against and doctored off a rotating drum, which had a surface temperature of approximately 104\u00b0 C. Finally the sheet was cooled by passing room temperature air through the sheet prior to winding into a roll. The temperature of the wound roll was measured to be approximately 24\u00b0 C.",
        "The bonding formulation for this example was prepared as two separate mixtures, called the \u201clatex\u201d and \u201creactant\u201d. The \u201clatex\u201d material contained the epoxy-reactive polymer and the \u201creactant\u201d was the epoxy-functional polymer. Each mixture was made up independently and then combined together prior to use. After the latex and reactant mixtures were combined, the appropriate amount of \u201cthickener\u201d (Natrosol solution) was added to adjust viscosity. The \u201clatex\u201d and \u201creactant\u201d mixtures contained the following ingredients, listed in their order of addition.",

        "Lithium Chloride (LiCl) salt was added to the bonding formulation as a tracer to enable latex addition level to be analyzed using atomic absorption spectroscopy. An amount of LiCl no less than 250 parts per million (ppm) was added in the bonding formulation to ensure accurate detection measurement.

First a calibration curve of absorbance vs. lithium concentration in ppm was created with standard LiCl solutions in water. The bonding formulations and bonded sheet were analyzed with atomic absorption spectroscopy after undergoing a series of combustion and water extraction steps to capture all lithium ions present in the respective samples. The weights of LiCl in the bonding formulation and bonded sheet samples were obtained by comparing their atomic absorbance values to the LiCl calibration curve. The concentration of LiCl in the bonding formulation was calculated, and then the weight of LiCl in each bonded sheet sample was converted into the amount of bonding formulation (Wt(BF)) applied to the sheet based on the LiCl content in the bonding formulation.

Both outer layers of the UCTAD basesheet contained 100% northern softwood kraft pulp. One outer layer was treated with 8.0 kilograms (kg)/metric ton (Mton) of dry fiber of a debonding agent, ProSoft\u00ae TQ1003 (Hercules, Inc.) and the other outer layer was treated with 3.0 kg/Mton of Prosoft\u00ae TQ1003. Both outer layers were also treated with 5.0 kg/Mton of a wet strength agent, Kymene 557LX (Hercules, Inc.). Combined, the outer layers comprised 50% of the total fiber weight of the sheet (25% in each layer). The center layer, which comprised 50% of the total fiber weight of the sheet, was also comprised of northern softwood kraft pulp. The fibers in this layer were also treated with 8.0 kg/Mton of ProSoft\u00ae TQ1003 debonder.",
        "The machine-chest furnish containing the chemical additives was diluted to approximately 0.2 percent consistency and delivered to a layered headbox. The forming fabric speed was approximately 445 meters per minute. The resulting web was then rush-transferred to a transfer fabric (Voith Fabrics, t1207-6) traveling 25% slower than the forming fabric using a vacuum box to assist the transfer. At a second vacuum-assisted transfer, the web was transferred and wet-molded onto the throughdrying fabric (Voith Fabrics, t1207-6). The web was dried with a through-air-dryer resulting in a basesheet with an air-dry basis weight of approximately 48 grams per square meter (gsm).",
        "The resulting sheet was fed to a gravure printing line, similar to that shown in FIG. 1, traveling at about 1000 feet per minute (305 meters per minute) where a latex binder was printed onto one side of the sheet. The printed side of the sheet was then pressed against and doctored off a rotating drum, which had a surface temperature of approximately 84\u00b0 C. Finally the sheet was wound onto a roll without any additional thermal curing. The temperature of the wound roll was measured to be approximately 36\u00b0 C.",
        "The bonding formulation for this example contained a \u201clatex\u201d, \u201creactant\u201d, \u201canti-blocking additive\u201d and \u201cpH control chemistry\u201d, as listed below in their order of addition.",

For this bonding formulation, the weight percent ratio of azetidinium-functional polymer based on carboxylic acid-functional polymer (azetidinium-reactive polymer) was about 6.25%.",
        "The viscosity of the print fluid was 140 cps, when measured at room temperature using a viscometer (Brookfield\u00ae Synchro-lectric viscometer Model RVT, Brookfield Engineering Laboratories Inc. Stoughton, Mass.) with a #1 spindle operating at 20 rpm. The oven-dry solids of the print fluid was 38.4 weight percent. The print fluid pH was 6.0.",
        "Thereafter the print/creped sheet was removed from the roll and tested for basis weight, tensile strength and sheet blocking. Wet tensile testing was conducted after first artificially aging the sheet for 5 minutes in an oven operating at 105\u00b0 C. Approximately 6% by weight Airflex\u00ae 426 was applied to the sheet.",
