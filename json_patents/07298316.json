        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "In a radar system, filtering and restraining clutter and electronic countermeasures are two subjects. In a scanning space of radar, no matter desired target (e.g. planes) or undesired target (e.g. mountain, cloud, rain etc.) reflects EM wave of radar system and generates echo signal received by an antenna of the radar system. So-called clutter is the echo signal generated by the undesired object. The interference of clutter affects probability for detecting desired target for a radar system, and results the false alarm rate of erroneous target increasing. To establish a clutter map is a method for effectively filtering and restraining the clutter. The said clutter map is a clutter data recorder in scanning area of a radar system. That is, recording intensity of clutter generated by an object in a scanning area of a radar system to establish a clutter intensity space map in the scanning area. The clutter map is used to generate a detection threshold.",
        "Conventionally, the area established by clutter map is all scanning area of a radar system or partial stationary area. In fact, a valid area of a clutter map is a range generating clutter affecting a radar system for detecting target, so the clutter map only establishes the area where a clutter exits. Furthermore, what is called interference map records an area with an object generating clutter in a scanning area of a radar system. In other words, the interference map is a spatial map recording a distribution of a plurality of clutter blocks in the scanning of the radar system. It is using a clutter map memory with limited capacitance effectively and flexibly by establishing clutter map only for an area indicated a clutter block according to an interference map. In addition, for the area indicated clutter block according to the interference map, the radar selects different searching mode, like moving target indication (MTI), to filter clutter.",
        "An object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and a method for automatically detecting a clutter block capable of deciding where there is an object producing clutter in the scanning area of the radar system.",
        "Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and a method for instantly detecting an interference source capable of deciding whether an interference source interfering the operation of the radar system exists.",
        "A further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and a method capable of producing a clutter threshold value for detecting a target.",
        "The present invention provides an apparatus for instantly automatic detecting clutter blocks and an interference source and for dynamically establishing a clutter map, which is suitable for a radar system and the apparatus provided by the present invention includes at least:",
        "1. A clutter block detecting module receiving a plurality of range cell data. Wherein, each range cell data represents echo intensity at a different distance position of a radar beam area with an elevation and an azimuth in the analyzing space of the radar system. Besides, the clutter block detecting module would divide a radar beam area into a plurality of detecting areas according to a predetermined distance. When the accumulated value of a range cell data in a detecting area is larger than a clutter block level, the detecting area is defined as a clutter block by the clutter block detecting module.",
        "2. An interference source detecting module. The interference source detecting module also receives the above-described range cell data and accumulates the range cell data in each radar beam area. The accumulated value is compared with an interference source reference level to decide whether an interference source exists.",
        "3. A clutter map establishing module generates a plurality of clutter map cells according to the range cell data. Wherein, the clutter map cells on different beam area store in three memory blocks sequentially. When one of the clutter map cells is extracted, two clutter map cells on adjacent beam area are also extracted. The largest value among the three clutter map cells is regarded as a clutter threshold value to detect the target.",
        "In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for instantly detecting clutter blocks, which is suitable for a radar system too. The method for instantly detecting clutter blocks provided by the present invention includes the following steps. First, a plurality of range cell data is received, wherein each range cell data represents echo intensity at a different distance position of a radar beam area with an elevation and an azimuth in the detection space of the radar system. Next, each radar beam area is divided into a plurality of detecting areas and each detecting area includes data of a preset number of range cells. Afterwards, all range cell data of each detecting area are accumulated to obtain a corresponding accumulated value. Further, the accumulated value of each detecting area is compared with a clutter block level to produce a comparison result. Finally, in the present invention, the comparison result is used for deciding which detecting area is regarded as a clutter block. The distribution of the clutter blocks is an interference map.",
        "On the other hand, the method for instantly detecting an interference source provided by the present invention is also suitable for a radar system. According to the method, the following steps are included. First, a plurality of the abovementioned range cell data is received. Afterwards, all range cell data of each radar beam area are accumulated to obtain a corresponding accumulated value. Further, the accumulated value of each radar beam area is compared with an interference source reference level to produce a comparison result. Finally, in the present invention, the comparison result is used for deciding in which orientation of radar beam area an interference source exists.",

Wherein, the range cell collapsing circuit receives a plurality of the abovementioned range cell data for producing data of a plurality of range collapsing cells. Each range collapsing cell comprises a corresponding clutter map collapsing cell (CMCC) and two clutter map spreading cells (CMSCs) adjacent to the CMCC; wherein each CMCC includes a first number of range cells, while each CMSC includes a second number of range cells where CMCC\u25a12CMSC. The range cell collapsing circuit selects the largest value in each CMCC and the CMSCs adjacent to the CMCC as the value of the corresponding range collapsing cell. Besides, the dynamically updating circuit is coupled to the output of the range cell collapsing circuit for instantly and dynamically updating the value of each clutter map cell. The memory device receives the output from the dynamically updating circuit; and the memory device includes a plurality of memory blocks, and each memory block has a plurality of memory regions for sequentially storing data of clutter map cells of all radar beam areas on each elevation layer. The threshold value generating circuit would, from the memory device, select the largest value among each selected clutter map cell and the clutter map cells with the corresponding position in the radar beam areas adjacent to the selected beam area as a clutter threshold value for detecting the target.",
        "The present invention further provides a method for establishing a clutter map. First, the above-described range cell data are received. Next, the range cells of each radar beam area are collapsed into a plurality of range collapsing cells, where each range collapsing cell includes a preset number of range cells. Then, the range collapsing cell and a clutter map cell at the corresponding position re-compose a new clutter map cell according a preset proportion. Afterwards, all clutter map cells of the selected elevation layer are sequentially stored into a memory space. Wherein, the memory space has a plurality of memory blocks and each memory block has a plurality of memory regions for storing all clutter map cells. Further, each clutter map cell is sequentially selected from the memory space and the largest value among each selected clutter map cell and the clutter map cells with the corresponding position in the radar beam areas adjacent to the selected beam area is regarded as a clutter threshold value for detecting the target.",

        "In general, a radar system occupies a detection space; when an object intrudes into the detection space, the object will be sensed by the radar system. FIG. 1 is a schematic cubic drawing of a detection space of a radar system. Referring to FIG. 1, a radar system 100 has a detection space 110, which is encompassed by scanning of the electromagnetic wave with an effective sensing range emitted by the radar system 100. When an airplane, for example, enters into the detection space 110, the airplane will reflect the electromagnetic wave emitted by the radar system 100 with an echo signal. The radar system 100 will decide whether an object exists within the detection space 110 in accordance with the echo signal intensity, and decide the distance between the target and radar system 100 according to the time difference during the time of radiating EM waves to the time of radar system 100 receiving the echo signal.",
        "It is known to those skilled in the art that a radar system scans the detection space thereof not in one-time manner, but uses the radar system as center and divides the detection space into a plurality beam spaces. The radar system orients toward some orientation or some elevation scanning and positioning space coordinate of the target by known scan orientation and calculated distance of target. The main functions of the radar system are detecting target and marking the space coordinate of the target.",
        "In FIG. 1, when radar system 100 scans the detection space 110, the radar system 100 divides the detection space 110 into different elevation layer, for example \u03c61, \u03c62, and \u03c6m, according to beam angle of vertical orientation of EM waves generated by the radar system 100. Noticeably, in FIG. 1, an elevation increment, for example, the difference between \u03c62 and \u03c61 is very big for showing the purpose in exaggeration manner so those skilled in the art can understand it.",
        "The definition of so-called \u201crange cell\u201d must be given first. FIG. 2 is the localized top view of the detection space in FIG. 1. Referring to FIG. 2, it shows one of different elevation layers, which feature in different elevation \u03c61, \u03c62 and \u03c6m. Each elevation layer in a detection space can be divided into a plurality of beam area, for example Yn, according to an azimuth \u03b8 of horizontal orientation of EM wave generated by a radar, where n is a positive integer indicating the n-th radar beam area.",
        "Each radar beam area is further divided into a plurality of range cells according to a predetermined radar range resolution d. The data contained by each range cell is just the echo intensity at the corresponding position.",
        "FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an apparatus for instantly automatic detecting clutter blocks and an interference source for dynamically establishing a clutter map according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 3, an apparatus 300 provided by the present invention includes a clutter block detecting module 302, an interference source detecting module 304 and a clutter map establishing module 306, all of which are able to receive a plurality of range cell data R(i).",
        "The clutter block detecting module 302 would divide all range cells of each radar beam area into a plurality of detecting areas according to a predetermined space as shown in FIG. 2. For example, every N range cells are regarded as a detecting area, where N is a positive integer. Afterwards, the clutter block detecting module 302 accumulates all range cell data of each detecting area. Further, the accumulated value is compared with a clutter block level. If the accumulated value of any detecting area is larger than the clutter block level, the detecting area is defined as a clutter block.",
        "FIG. 4 is a circuit block diagram of a clutter block detecting module according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 4, the clutter block detecting module includes an accumulated unit 401 which receives range cell data R(i) through the input of the clutter block detecting module. The accumulated unit 401 accumulates every N pieces of the range cell data R(i). Then the accumulated value is outputted to a comparator 403, where the accumulated value from the accumulated unit 401 is compared with a clutter block level C1. If the output from the accumulated unit 401 is larger than the clutter block level C1, the comparator 403 will produce a logic-1 output. Contrarily, the comparator 403 will produce a logic-0 output.",
        "The accumulated unit 401 can include an AND gate circuit 411, an adder 413 and a register 415. Wherein, an input end of the AND gate circuit 411 is coupled to a clearance signal CL1, while another input end receives the output from the accumulated unit 401. The adder 413 serves for receiving the range cell data R(i) and the output from the AND gate circuit 411, adding the above-mentioned data and outputting the added result to the register 415. If the output value of the register 415 is larger than clutter block level, the comparator 403 outputs logic-1 to define the detecting area being a clutter block. Oppositely, the comparator 403 outputs logic-0 to define the detection area being a non-clutter block.",
        "The clutter block detecting module 302 can further include a memory device 405 and a counter 407. In the embodiment, the memory device 405 can be a memory and is used for storing the output from the comparator 403. Furthermore, the counter 407 receives the output of the comparator 403 through a AND gate 409 to count the times of logic-1 generated by comparator 403.",
        "In the embodiment, both the memory 405 and the counter 407 are comprised with an enabling end \u2018enable\u2019, respectively. Wherein, the enabling end of the memory 405 is coupled to an enabling signal EN1, while the enabling end of the counter 407 is coupled to the output end of the AND gate circuit 409. One of input ends of the AND gate circuit 409 is coupled to the output of the comparator 403, while another input end thereof is coupled to the enabling signal EN1.",
        "FIG. 5 is a timing chart corresponding to the clutter block detecting module in FIG. 4. Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, at a time point t0 the clearance signal CL1 is logic-0, so that the AND gate circuit 411 is able to produce a zero output to the adder 413. Meanwhile, the first range cell data R(1) is sent to the adder 413. The adder 413 adds the range cell data R(1) to the output from the AND gate circuit 411, followed by sending the result to the register 415. Since after the first range data R(1) is sent to the register 415, the clearance signal CL1 is transited to logic-1, so that the following range cell data R(i) sent to the register 415 are continuously accumulated to the sum of the range cell data R(i) previously arrived at the adder 413.",
        "Once N pieces of range cell data R(i) are accumulated by the adder 413, i.e. all range cell data R(i) of a detecting area are accumulated, the clearance signal CL1 would be transited to logic-0 again at time point t1 and the enabling signal EN1 is transited to a high-level, so that the memory 405 are enabled and the output result of the comparator 403 is written in memory 405. On the other side, once the output result of the comparator is logic-1, it is indicating clutter block and the output of the counter 407 adding 1 at enabling signal EN1 being high level. Meanwhile the number of clutter block increases 1. At this time, another n pieces of range cell data R(i) are sent to the adder 413 together with repeating the above-described operations of the accumulated unit 401. According to the counting value of the counter 407, the capacity of the clutter map memory to store the clutter map marked a clutter block area is determined. (The counter value of the counter 407 is used for determining the capacity of the clutter map memory for constructing the clutter map marked with clutter blocks.)",
        "FIG. 6A is a flowchart of a method for instantly detecting clutter blocks according to an embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 6B is a interference diagram according to an embodiment of the present invention, wherein the method in the FIG. 6A is suitable, but not limited to, for the above-described clutter block detecting module 302. Referring to FIGS. 6A and 6B, first at step S601, a plurality of range cell data is received. Next at step S603, all received range cells are divided into a plurality of detecting areas as the block areas in the FIG. 6B according to a predetermined space, wherein the detecting areas are equivalent to the above-described detecting areas and the predetermined space in the embodiment is, for example, 500 meters or one kilometer.",
        "After the range cells are divided into a plurality of detecting areas, at step S605, all range cell data of every detecting area are accumulated to obtain a corresponding accumulated value. Further, at S611, based on the accumulated value, the processed detecting area can be identified whether it is a clutter block or not.",
        "It is assumed that a terrain object or cloudy and raining area exists at the position where the processed detecting area locates, the electromagnetic wave emitted by the radar system would be reflected by the terrain object and an echo signal, i.e. the content of the range cell, is produced. After the radar system receives the echo signal, through the above-described steps from S601 to S605, an accumulated value is obtained. Furthermore, at step S611, the accumulated value is compared with a clutter block level. In general, a terrain object or a cloudy and raining area would produce a stronger echo data, thus the above-described accumulated value is always larger than the clutter block level. Finally, at step S613, it is decided that outputting logic-1 data to define the detecting area is a clutter block.",
        "For example, in the FIG. 6B, after the electromagnetic wave emitted by the radar system reflected by an object 61, the echo signal that is larger than the clutter threshold value is generated. Meanwhile, the present invention decides the detecting areas around the object 61 are clutter blocks.",
        "Contrarily, if the above-mentioned accumulated value is less than the clutter threshold value, it is concluded that the generated clutter strength is not strong enough to affect the target detection at the detecting area position. So outputting logic-0 data to define the detecting area is not a clutter block (e.g. the blank blocks in the FIG. 6B) as the described in the step S615. Then, as the described in step S617, the determined result that is the logic-1 or logic-0 data is saved in a memory. By means of the above-described method, it is able to record the position of the clutter blocks to the detection space of the radar system.",
        "Continuing to FIG. 3, in response to the electronic wars that are concerned by many countries today, various anti-radar techniques are developed. One of the techniques employs an interference source to emit an interference signal for confusing the detection of the radar system. Therefore, an interference source detecting module 304 of the present invention is provided to decide whether an interference source exists at all directions of radar beam areas or not.",
        "FIG. 7 is a circuit block diagram of an interference source detecting module according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 7, similarly to the above-described clutter block detecting module 302, the interference source detecting module 304 also includes an accumulated unit 701, a comparator 703 and a memory device 705. Wherein, the memory device 705 has an enabling end \u2018enable\u2019 for receiving an enabling signal EN2. The couplings of all function blocks are similar to the clutter block detecting module 302 in FIG. 4 and thus the detail is omitted herein for simplicity. A unique point is that the output from the accumulated unit 701 is compared with an interference source reference level C2 by the comparator 703. If the output from the accumulated unit 701 is larger than the interference source reference level C2, the comparator 703 will produce a logic-1 output; otherwise, a logic-0 output is given by the comparator 703.",
        "The accumulated unit 701 also includes an AND gate circuit 711, an adder 713 and a register 715. Wherein, an input end of the AND gate circuit 711 receives the clearance signal CL2 and another input end thereof is coupled to the output from the accumulated unit 701. The couplings of the other circuit blocks can refer to the depiction of the accumulated unit 401.",
        "FIG. 8 is a timing chart corresponding to the interference source detecting module in FIG. 7. Referring to FIGS. 7 and 8, when the first range cell data R(1) is sent to the adder 713 of the accumulated unit 701, the clearance signal CL2 is logic-0, which makes the adder 713 to send the first range cell data R(1) to the register 715. Due to a low-level of the enabling signal EN2 at the point, the memory device 705 is disabled. After the first range cell data R(1) passes the register 715, the clearance signal CL2 is transited to logic-1. In this way, the range cell data input to the adder 713 are accumulated to the previous sum of the range cell data input to the adder 713.",
        "Once all range cell data of a radar beam area are accumulated, the comparator 703 compares the accumulated value and the interference source reference level. At this time, the enabling signal EN2 goes to high resulting the memory 705 being enabled, and the output result of comparator 703 is written in memory 705. If the accumulated value is larger than the interference source reference level, a logic-1 output is produced by the comparator 703 to define an interference source existing in the orientation of the beam area. Appositively, a logic-0 output is produced by the comparator 703 to define no interference source existing in the orientation of the beam area. The energy of echo signal of radar is in inverse proportion with distance quartically, and the interference energy of interference source for the radar is in inverse proportion with distance squarely. If the interference source exists, the energy of echo signal in the search window will be abnormally large. An accumulated value of the energy of the echo signal is used to determine whether the interference source exists or not.

For those radar beam areas where the value are larger than the interference source reference level, a conclusion that an interference source exists at the area direction can be made and outputting logic-1 data, as described in step S914.

Referring to FIGS. 10 and 11, for the clutter map establishing module 306 to generate the clutter threshold value, the range cell collapsing circuit 1010 receives a plurality of range cell data R(i) first, as described at step S1101. Due to tremendous data of all range cells in the entire detection space, as described at step S1103, a range cell collapsing circuit 1010 is needed to properly collapse all the received range cell data R(i) into a plurality of range collapsing cells, so that the storing space in the memory device 1030 can be saved. Next, as described in step S1105, the dynamically updating circuit 1020 dynamically updates each range collapsing cell and original clutter map cell of the memory device 1030 at the same position to obtain a new clutter map cell. Then, as illustrated in step S1107, the dynamically updating circuit 1020 divides each number of radar beam area by 3 to obtain a remainder, and stores the clutter map cells in three memory blocks of a memory space respectively according to the remainder. When the threshold value generating circuit 1040 generates the clutter threshold value, each clutter map cell is selected from the memory device and the clutter map cells with the corresponding position in the beam areas adjacent to the selected beam area are selected too.
