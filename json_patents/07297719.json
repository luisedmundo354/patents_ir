        "The present invention relates to materials processing, and more particularly, to a method and integrated system for purifying and delivering a metal carbonyl precursor used to process a substrate.",
        "Manufacturing of integrated circuits includes deposition of various materials onto patterned substrates such as silicon wafers. These materials include metal and metal-containing layers, for example diffusion barriers/liners to prevent diffusion of copper (Cu) conducting layers into dielectric materials and seed layers to promote adhesion and growth of the Cu layers onto the substrate. As the minimum feature sizes of patterned substrates continue to shrink, deposition processes are required that can provide advanced layers onto high-aspect ratio structures at sufficiently low temperatures.",
        "Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has seen increasing use for preparation of coatings and thin layers in semiconductor wafer processing. CVD is a favored deposition method in many respects, for example, because of its ability to provide highly conformal and high quality layers at relatively fast processing times. Further, CVD is beneficial in depositing layers on substrates of irregular shapes including the provision of highly conformal layers even with respect to deep contacts and other openings. In general, CVD techniques involve the delivery of gaseous precursors (reactants) to the surface of a substrate where chemical reactions take place under temperature and pressure conditions that are favorable to the thermodynamics of the desired reaction. The type and composition of layers that can be formed using CVD can be affected by the ability to deliver the reactants or reactant precursors to the surface of the substrate.",
        "In order for the device manufacturing process to be practical, the deposition processes need to be carried out in a reasonable amount of time. This requirement can necessitate efficient delivery of a precursor containing a metal element from a metal precursor vaporization system to a process chamber containing the substrate(s) to be processed. A common problem encountered in the deposition of metals and metal-containing materials by CVD techniques are low deposition rates onto a substrate due to low vapor pressure of the metal-containing precursor and the transport issues associated therewith, thereby making the deposition process impractical. A low vapor pressure can limit the flow of the metal-containing precursor from the metal precursor vaporization system through gas lines to a process chamber of a deposition system where a substrate is exposed to the metal-containing precursor.",
        "The delivery of metal-containing precursors in CVD processing can be carried out using the sublimator/bubbler method where the precursor is usually placed in a metal precursor vaporization system that is then heated to transform the precursor into a gaseous compound (vapor), which is then transported into the process chamber, often using a carrier gas. However, this procedure has not been able to reliably and reproducibly deliver the precursor to the process chamber for a number of reasons. The major problems with the technique are centered on the inability to consistently vaporize a solid precursor at a controlled rate such that a reproducible flow of precursor vapor can be delivered to the process chamber. Also, it is difficult to ensure complete saturation of the fast moving carrier gas stream because of the limited amount of exposed surface area of the solid precursor in the metal precursor vaporization system and a lack of uniform temperature to provide maximum sublimation/evaporation. In addition, the temperature to which the solid precursor can be heated to provide adequate vapor pressure can be limited by premature decomposition of the precursor at that temperature. Decomposition or partial reaction of the solid precursor in the metal precursor vaporization system can further complicate the precursor delivery due to low or negligible vapor pressure of the partially reacted precursor compared to the un-reacted (fresh) precursor. In addition, a metal-containing precursor may contain metal-containing particulates that may be transferred to the process chamber and can accumulate on the substrate.",
        "Thus, the presence of metal-containing impurities in metal-containing precursors may require purifying the precursor prior to processing substrates. Current separation methods include dissolving the un-reacted precursor using a liquid solvent (e.g., acetone, toluene, etc) and filtering the metal-containing impurities from the solvent. This method commonly require long process times and large amounts of the solvent due to low solubility of the metal-containing impurities in the solvent.",
        "Embodiments of the invention provide a method and integrated system for purifying and delivering a metal carbonyl precursor used to process a substrate, including a process of depositing a metal or metal-containing layer on a substrate. An as-received or used (old) metal carbonyl precursor can contain metal-containing impurities, including partially reacted metal carbonyl precursor and metal-containing particulate impurities such as metal particles. The purified metal carbonyl precursor contains significantly lower amounts of the metal-containing impurities, thereby allowing efficient delivery of a high purity metal carbonyl precursor and deposition of metal or metal-containing layers with low amounts of metal-containing impurities. Embodiments of the invention can include various metal carbonyl precursors with the general formula Mx(CO)y. The metal carbonyls include, but are not limited to, W(CO)6, Ni(CO)4, Mo(CO)6, CO2(CO)8, Rh4(CO)12, Re2(CO)10, Cr(CO)6, Ru3(CO)12, and Os3(CO)12.",
        "According to one embodiment of the invention, the method includes providing a metal carbonyl precursor containing un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor and metal-containing impurities in a metal precursor vaporization chamber containing a precursor collection plate such that the metal carbonyl precursor is spaced from the precursor collection plate, evacuating the metal precursor vaporization chamber, pressurizing the metal precursor vaporization chamber with a CO-containing gas, vaporizing the un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor, and condensing the vaporized un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor as a purified metal carbonyl precursor on the precursor collection plate, whereby at least a portion of the metal-containing impurities remain spaced from the precursor collection plate.

A fresh metal carbonyl precursor can, over time, partially decompose to form a partially decomposed precursor (e.g., Mx(CO)y\u2212z, where z\u22671). Since the un-reacted precursor and partially decomposed precursor can have different vapor pressures, the precursor vapor cannot be reliably and reproducibly sublimated/evaporated in the metal precursor vaporization chamber and delivered to the process chamber. In addition, metal carbonyl precursors can contain expensive precious metals, thus requiring that the partially reacted precursor be separated from the un-reacted precursor and recycled for producing a fresh precursor batch.",

No. 11/238,501, entitled \u201cMETHOD FOR PURIFYING A METAL-CARBONYL PRECURSOR,\u201d filed Sep. 28, 2005, describes how the use of an as-received (from a chemical supplier) metal carbonyl precursor containing un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor and metal-containing impurities in a heated metal precursor vaporization chamber can contribute to the inability to provide a reproducible flow of un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor vapor to a process chamber for depositing a metal or metal-containing layer with low particle counts on a substrate. In one example, as-received ruthenium carbonyl precursor can contain partially decomposed Ru3(CO)12 and Ru metal particulates. In this example, the as-received Ru3(CO)12 precursor can be highly pure with respect to total Ru content but not with respect to un-reacted Ru3(CO)12. In another example, the metal particulate impurity can contain a different metal than found in the metal carbonyl precursor, for example Fe particulate impurity in a solid Ru3(CO)12 precursor. In general, the metal particulate impurity can contain any metal or metal-containing material (e.g., metal oxide, metal nitride, metal carbide), including, but not limited to, transition metals, alkali metals, and alkali earth metals. The metal particulate impurities can be non-volatile or have low volatility compared to the Ru3(CO)12 precursor, but it was observed that when a carrier gas was flowed through the metal precursor vaporization chamber, a significant number of the metal particulate impurities were transferred to the process chamber along with the Ru3(CO)12 vapor, resulting in unacceptably high levels of accumulated metal particulate impurities on a substrate during processing in the process chamber.

        "Metal precursor vaporization chambers utilized for providing Ru3(CO)12 vapor have contemplated operating within a temperature range of approximately 40\u00b0 C. to 45\u00b0 C. for Ru3(CO)12 precursor under vacuum conditions in order to prevent decomposition, which occurs at higher temperatures. For example, Ru3(CO)12 can decompose at elevated temperatures to form by-products, such as those illustrated below:\n\nRu3(CO)12(s)Ru3(CO)x(s)+(12\u2212x)CO(g)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nor,\n\nRu3(CO)x(ad)3Ru(s)+xCO(g)\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nthereby forming a mixture of Ru3(CO)12, Ru3(CO)x, and possibly Ru metal in the metal precursor vaporization chamber. The low vapor pressure of Ru3(CO)12 and the small process window, can result in a very low deposition rate of a Ru layer on a substrate in a deposition system. In the above-mentioned co-pending applications, it was realized that a CO-containing gas may be used to reduce dissociation of the Ru3(CO)12 precursor, thereby allowing for heating the Ru3(CO)12 precursor to a high temperature (e.g., 80\u00b0 C., or higher), which increases the vapor pressure of the Ru3(CO)12 precursor without significant decomposition of the Ru3(CO)12 precursor vapor during vaporization.",
        "In embodiments of the current invention, a CO-containing gas is utilized to effectively vaporize and separate un-reacted Ru3(CO)12 from Ru-containing and non-Ru-containing impurities in the metal precursor vaporization chamber 110. Further, the use of a CO-containing gas reduces dissociation of the Ru3(CO)12 precursor, thereby shifting the equilibrium in Equation (1) to the left and reducing premature decomposition of the Ru3(CO)12 precursor while allowing for heating the Ru3(CO)12 precursor to higher temperature in the metal precursor vaporization chamber 110 than is possible without a CO-containing gas. It is believed that addition of the CO gas to the Ru3(CO)12 precursor vapor allows for increasing the vaporization temperature from approximately 40\u00b0 C. to approximately 150\u00b0 C., or higher. The elevated temperature increases the vapor pressure of the Ru3(CO)12 precursor, resulting in increased vaporization of the Ru3(CO)12 precursor 114 from the precursor tray 112.",

When the transfer of the un-reacted metal carbonyl precursor from the precursor tray 112 to the precursor collection plate 120 is complete, a metal-containing impurity layer 114a containing partially reacted metal carbonyl precursor and any metal particulate impurities remains on the precursor tray 112. After the purifying process, the purified metal carbonyl precursor 120a may be vaporized by increasing the temperature of the precursor collection plate 120 from the condensation temperature to a vaporization temperature, and the vapor is then delivered to the deposition system 150 to be utilized for depositing a metal or metal-containing layer on a substrate in the deposition system 150.

A process gas containing the vapor of the purified metal carbonyl precursor 132a formed by flowing a carrier gas containing CO from gas supply system 118 into the metal precursor vaporization chamber 110 using the gas feed line 121, and the process gas is delivered to the deposition system 150 to process a substrate.",
        "In each of the embodiments shown and described, the metal precursor vaporization chamber 110 is depicted to receive the precursor 114 in the lower portion 111, and the precursor collection plates 120, 130, 132 are positioned above the lower portion 111. It may be appreciated, however, that alternative orientations of the chamber 110, precursor 114, and plates 120, 130, 132 are contemplated. For example, a precursor tray 112 may be mounted in an upper portion 131 of the chamber 110 and the precursor collection plate(s) 120, 130, 132 may be positioned below the precursor 114. In another example, the precursor collection plate(s) 120, 130, 132 may be positioned in side-by-side relation to the precursor 114. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, the precursor collection plate(s) need only be spaced from the precursor 114, in any manner, so as to enable partially reacted precursor and metal impurities 114a to remain in one position and the purified precursor 120a or 132a to condense in another position within the chamber 110. Similarly, precursor collection plate 130 need only be spaced from precursor collection plate 120, in any manner, so as to enable partially reacted precursor and metal impurities 120b to remain in one position and the further purified precursor 130a to condense in another position within the chamber 110. Further, the delivery line 142 need not be coupled at the top of the chamber 110, but rather, may be coupled at any desired location.",
        "Although only certain exemplary embodiments of this invention have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of this invention. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention."
