    "description": [
        "The present invention relates to coatings for transducers in a sensor that contact a fluid, which is defined herein as a liquid, a gas or combinations thereof, to apply signals and/or measure responses when measuring a fluid property, wherein the fluid property can be a physical or chemical quality or condition. The invention finds application on transducer surfaces, which can be metal, semi-conductors, polymers, crystalline or amorphous materials or the like, that have, or can be functionalized to have, hydroxyl sites. The invention can be used with transducers for off-line, on-line or in-line monitoring and/or analysis of fluids such as, for example, lubricants, natural and/or synthetic motor oils, standard additives and/or adjuncts, combustion engine fuels, other hydrocarbon-based fluids used in transportation and industrial applications, and the like. More specifically, the present invention relates to antifouling coatings that do not substantially interfere with the transducer's ability to apply signals to and/or measure responses from a fluid, while reducing the need for transducer maintenance, such as cleaning.",
        "Fluids are a critical component for the proper operation of many types of devices and/or processes. For example lubricants are needed for an internal combustion engine to efficiently provide power over a long service life, metal working fluid is needed in machining equipment for rapid metal removal and maximum tool life, and vapors above liquid can be used to identify the liquid. Optimum performance is achieved when the fluid in question is of a proper quantity and quality for the application. For a particular application, a fluid preferably includes an appropriate base fluid and desired performance additives, e.g. corrosion inhibitors, friction modifiers, dispersants, surfactants, detergents, markers and the like. During use or consumption, a fluid's condition should remain within specified limits, that is, chemical and/or other fluid changes should be within proper performance specifications.",
        "A fluid's quantity, initial quality and/or continuing condition are often determined using sensors that test particular fluid properties. Such sensors, whether used off-line, on-line, or in-line, typically have one or more transducers contacting the fluid to transmit a signal, receive a response, or both transmit a signal and receive a response. A limitation for sensors is that the transducer can be fouled by the fluid, or components of the fluid including contaminants, being tested. To alleviate a fouling problem, sensors may require regular cleaning or replacement of the transducers, often after each fluid test, in order to provide sufficiently accurate results. Fouling problems can be particularly acute with sensors that make surface dependent measurements in fluids that are \u201csurface active\u201d. For example, an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) infrared sensor, which uses an internal-reflectance-element (IRE) in contact with a fluid to determine fluid absorption at one or more frequencies, can show substantial signal drift in a lubricant formulated to provide surface corrosion and wear protection.",
        "While coatings, such as Teflon\u00ae, are known to be used in some applications to protect transducers from fouling, an issue with present coatings is that they can substantially interfere with a signal being sent and/or received by the transducer, thereby limiting the performance of a sensor. Typical coatings have their own IR attenuation which limits their use in IR sensor applications, and many current coatings have electrical impedance or porosity issues which limit their use in sensors that transmit or receive electrical signals. Another issue with current coatings on sensor transducers is that the coating thickness is not easily controlled. Many coatings, with desirable properties, cannot be controllably applied in a sufficiently thin layer; for example, on an ATR infrared sensor's IRE transducer the coating must be on the order of nanometers to allow the optical signal to penetrate through the coating and into the fluid. Another problem with current sensor coatings is that the coatings do not provide adequate fouling protection for the transducer. That is, the coating does not substantially decrease transducer maintenance. Therefore, there is need for an improved transducer coating that does not substantially interfere with the operation of a sensor and that provides an increased transducer maintenance-free operating period.",
        "The present invention overcomes limitations of previous coatings for transducers used to monitor/analyze fluids. The invention is a simple, cost-effective coating that has minimal effect on signals being sent and/or received by transducers in contact with a fluid, that can be applied in a controlled thickness, and that substantially decreases or eliminates transducer fouling thereby increasing the transducer's maintenance-free operating period.",

        "The present invention is a coating for sensor transducers that are used in the measurement of a fluid property.

        "and H3C and F3CH2CH2C are non-hydrolysable side-chains.",
        "Selection of a particular alkoxysilane or chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomer is determined by desired thickness and/or porosity of the coating, the antifouling characteristics that the material has as a coating in a particular fluid, by the particular characteristics that the material has as a coating for allowing appropriate signals to pass through the coating, between transducer and fluid, with minimal or no absorption of blockage and combinations thereof.",
        "The number of reactive sites on the alkoxysilane or chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomer is a variable in achieving a desired coating thickness and/or porosity. A monoalkoxysilane or a silicone-oligomer terminated at only one end with a chlorine will form a single bond to a transducer surface and is then not able to form bonds to other molecules. Therefore, the coating with a molecule having only one reactive site will be only one molecule thick and, depending on the density of sites on the transducer surface, the coating can be quite porous. A dialkoxysilane or a silicone-oligomer terminated with two chlorines, typically at each end but can include chlorine substitution on internal silicon atoms, can bond to two sites on the transducer surface or can form relatively long chains of molecules that can bond at both ends to sites on the transducer surface, allowing for increased coating thickness and/or bridging of the transducer surface between reactive hydroxyl sites to decrease the coating porosity. A trialkoxysilane or a silicone-oligomer substituted with greater than two chlorines allows not only for bonding to the transducer surface and for greater molecular length, but for cross-linking between the molecules forming the coating on the transducer surface. Cross-linking allows for further increases in thickness and/or reduced porosity of the coating. Ultimately, however, the reactivity of the alkoxysilanes or chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomers must be selected to minimize reactive site remaining on the coating so that the antifouling properties of the coating are maximized.",
        "To have good antifouling characteristics in a particular fluid, the coating must have a low surface energy relative to all fluid components, including contaminants, so that the surface is not easily wet by any the fluid components. Also the side-chains/repeat-groups of the silane or chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomer must be poor solvents for contaminants in the fluid. For example, a silane or chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomer with an amine side-chain/repeat-group would not be a good choice for use in a fluid that might have an acidic contaminant.",
        "To minimize signal absorption or blockage of signal between transducer and fluid, the coating needs to have a side-chains and/or repeat-groups selected based on the type of signal (e.g. optical, electrical, acoustic and the like) passing between transducer and fluid. For examples, the coating for an IR sensor has minimal absorption at the frequencies of interest, the coating for an electrical impedance sensor has appropriate electrical impedance at the frequencies of interest, and the coating for an acoustic sensor has appropriate acoustic impedance at the frequencies of interest. Another element to consider when selecting the correct alkoxysilanes or chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomers is whether the material can be applied to the transducer surface to form a coating of desired appropriate thickness and/or porosity to minimize signal absorption or blockage while achieving the desired antifouling properties.",
        "Alkoxysilanes are generally less reactive than chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomers, typically require hydrolysis, are easier to use to build up multiple layers and are less likely to bridge areas of the surface lacking hydroxyl groups. The chloro-terminated-silicone oligomers are more reactive, do not typically require hydrolysis, are more likely to bridge areas on the surface lacking hydroxyl groups, more difficult to use to build up multiple layers and generate corrosive HCI during reaction.",
        "The present invention forms appropriate coatings of alkoxysilanes or chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomers on fluid quality/condition sensor transducers. In one embodiment the process has four steps which are described in the following.",
        "The first process step is cleaning the transducer surface to remove hydrocarbons or other contaminants on the surface of the transducer introduced during a manufacturing process or during transducer storage and/or handling. Depending on the transducer-surface material, cleaning can be by any known process that removes contaminants; those processes include but are not limited to processes that are typically used when coating a surface with, for example, a paint or other protective or functional material. Such cleaning typically includes but are not limited to solvents, detergents or mixtures thereof, either with or without physical agitation or scrubbing, but can also include known chemical or physical processes that can clean or modify the surface. In cases where the transducer surface does not have a desired density of hydroxyl sites, the cleaning process may include but not limited to use of an oxidizer, as are known in the art, which creates additional reactive sites in addition to cleaning the surface.",
        "After cleaning the next coating process step is immersing the transducer in a solution of either alkoxysilane in an aqueous hydrocarbon-solvent solution or a chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomer in a dry hydrocarbon solvent. Alkoxysilanes contain Si\u2014OR groups, which hydrolyze to Si\u2014OH in the presence of water. Chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomers contain Si\u2014Cl groups that can react with hydroxyl sites on the transducer surface to form covalent bonds. There is also competition in the solution for the active alkoxysilane and chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomer groups to bond with other active groups both on molecules still in the solution, and, in the case where there is more than one reactive site per molecule, on molecules that have already bonded to the surface. Bonding between molecules in the solution effectively reduces the concentration of active molecules in solution and limits the useful life of the solution for transducer surface coating. Bonding between molecules with at least one molecule bonded to the transducer surface can increase coating thickness and/or reduce coating porosity. The uniformity and density/porosity of the coating bonded to the transducer surface is affected by the distribution and density of available hydroxyl sites. The thickness and porosity of the coating on the transducer coating is affected by, as already described, the number or reactive sites on the molecules, and by the concentration of the solution, the temperature of the solution and length of time that the transducer is left in the solution. The concentration alkoxysilane or chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomer in the solution is in the range of about 0.05 to about 20% preferably in the range of about 0.1 to about 10%, and is more preferably in the range about 0.5 to about 5%. In the case of the aqueous hydrocarbon-solvent solution for the alkoxysilane solution, an aqueous acidic alcohol solution is preferred. The temperature of the solution for immersing the transducer is can vary over a wide range from the freezing temperature to the boiling temperature of the solution; however, a temperature near ambient temperature is preferred for ease of processing. The time of transducer immersion is determined by the temperature of the solution and the desired coating thickness/density, but is limited, as described above, by the reactions between the molecules in solution that impede the addition of molecules to the surface of the transducer. In general, immersion times on the order of about 1 to about 60 minutes, in another embodiment about 1 to about 10 minutes.",
        "The third step of the process is rinsing the transducer surface with solvent to remove individual or multiple alkoxysilanes or chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomer molecules that are not bonded to the surface. The solvent includes but is not limited to the same solvent used in the solutions for coating the transducer or can be one or more other solvents that are known in the art to be useful for a rinsing process. Rinsing time is a function of the solvent, the temperature of the solvent and the thickness and porosity of the coating on the transducer surface. Transducers coated with chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomers typically require longer rinse times than alkoxysilanes due to the relative size of the oligomers. In general, however, rinsing times can be on the order of about 1 to about 60 minutes, in another embodiment about 1 to about 10 minutes.",
        "The fourth step of the process is drying the transducer surface. The drying process, which can occur in the range of at ambient to an elevated temperature, involves removing solvent from the coating on the transducer surface. The drying process also involves bonding any reactive alkoxysilane or chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomer sites that remain after the immersion and the rinsing steps of the process. In general, the chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomers, which are more reactive than alkoxysilanes, will have mostly reacted by the drying process and ambient temperature drying is typically sufficient to maximize the properties of a transducer coating using chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomers. The coating using the less reactive dialkoxysilanes, trialkoxysilanes, and/or bis-alkoxysilanes however, will typically have better coating properties if either the entire or at least the final portion of the drying process occurs at an elevated temperature to minimize the remaining reactive sites in the coating. Therefore, the preferred drying process for a transducer coated with alkoxysilanes, other than monoalkoxysilanes, includes completing the drying at elevated temperature, with the drying temperature being limited to temperatures that do not damage the coating or substrate. Silicone-oligomers that are substituted with greater than one chlorine may also benefit with final drying at elevated temperature after any remaining unreacted Si\u2014Cl groups have had a chance to hydrolyze. Actual drying time required for any of the coatings is a function of alkoxysilane or the chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomer used for the coating, and of the drying temperature and other process variables. As an example, a transducer with a trialkoxysilane coating that was air dried overnight to remove the rinsing solvent was dried at about 60\u00b0 C. and for about 4 hours to maximize cross-linking of the trialkoxysilanes.",
        "Coatings produced with alkoxysilanes or chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomers that have more than one reactive site per molecule may not be fully reacted, especially for the alkoxysilanes, after rinsing step of the transducer coating process. In one embodiment of the invention a thicker coating can be formed on fluid-property-sensor transducers by a second process that also has a first step of cleaning the transducer surface, a second step of immersing the transducer into a solution that includes but is not limited to dialkoxysilanes, trialkoxysilanes and/or bis-alkoxysilanes in an aqueous hydrocarbon-solvent solution or silicone-oligomers with at least two chloro-terminations in a dry hydrocarbon solvent, and a third step of rinsing the transducer surface. In this embodiment, however, the transducer is not fully dried in a fourth step to maximize bonding of the remaining reactive sites, but instead is either 1) immersed into a second solution of the type described for the second step of the process, or 2) if the solvent used to rinse the transducer after the previous coating is different than that used in a second solution, the transducer is dried to only remove the rinsing solvent before immersing the transducer into the second solution of the type described for the second step of the process. The second immersion is used to increase coating thickness and/or decrease coating porosity on the transducer surface. After this second immersion step, the process has a rinsing step to again to remove alkoxysilanes or chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomers or chains of alkoxysilanes or chloro-terminated-silicone-oligomers that are not bonded to the surface during the second immersion and a drying step to remove the rinsing solvent and to minimize remaining reactive sites in the coating.",
        "In other embodiments additional immersion, rinse, and, if needed solvent dry steps can be added before the transducer is finally dried to minimize remaining reactive sites to achieve a coating thickness/porosity that has the desired antifouling properties without substantially interfering with the transducer's ability to transmit or receive signals from a fluid.",
        "Shown in FIG. 1 is the output of an ATR infrared sensor designed to measure the soot content of a fluid. Line A is the sensor output for a first run of testing fluid samples where the IRE transducer of the sensor was clean at the start of the run and where the soot content of the tested samples increased from essentially 0% soot to approximately 8% soot as determined by a separate analytical method that is an industry standard to determining soot in a fluid. Lines B, C D and E are the sensor output for subsequent runs of testing the same fluid samples where the sensor's IRE transducer was not cleaned between runs. While lines A through E should be essentially the same for both runs, the figure shows that the sensor output decreased with each subsequent run. When the IRE was cleaned and the sensor rerun, the sensor output returned to about the output of line A, indicating that the IRE was fouled by the soot containing fluid.",
        "Shown in FIG. 2 is the output of an ATR infrared sensor similar to that used to generate the outputs shown in FIG. 1 except that the sensor's IRE was coated in the following manner. The IRE was cleaned using heptane. A solution of water in isopropyl alcohol (5/95) by volume was adjusted to a pH of approximately 5 with acetic acid. Methyltriethoxysilane was added to form about a 2% solution and allowed to hydrolyze for about 5 minutes with gentle agitation. The IRE was suspended in the solution for about 5 minutes. The part was rinsed with isopropyl alcohol and allowed to air dry overnight. The IRE was then dried in a forced draft oven at approximately 60 C. for about 4 hours. Line F is the sensor output for a first run using the same soot containing sample fluids described above. Lines G, H, I, J are the sensor output for subsequent runs of testing the fluid samples where the sensor's IRE transducer was not cleaned between runs. The output for the individual runs were about the same and cleaning the lens showed essentially no change in sensor output when an additional run was made, indicating that the coated IRE of the sensor used for FIG. 2 had relatively minor fouling when compared to the fouling shown in FIG. 1 for the sensor with the uncoated IRE. Therefore, the sensor of FIG. 2 with the coated IRE provided better performance with less need for maintenance than the sensor with the uncoated IRE of FIG. 1.",
        "Results similar to those, shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 were produced by ATR infrared sensors that had uncoated and coated IRE transducers respectively where the coated IRE was produced by the following process. The IRE was cleaned using heptane. A solution of water in isopropyl alcohol (5/95) by volume was adjusted to a pH of approximately 5 with acetic acid. (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)trimethoxysilane was added to form about a 2% solution and allowed to hydrolyze for about 5 minutes with gentle agitation. The IRE was suspended in the solution for approximately 5 minutes. The IRE was rinsed with isopropyl alcohol and allowed to air dry overnight. The part was then dried in a forced draft oven at approximately 60 C. for about 4 hours.",
