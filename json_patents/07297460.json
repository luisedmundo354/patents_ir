        "The present invention relates to radiation curable ink compositions containing polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS).",
        "Ink jet printing has become a technology of choice for short-run printing. A recent survey on progress and trends in ink jet printing technology is given by Hue P. Le in Journal of Imaging Science and Technology Vol. 42 (1), January/February 1998, which is herein incorporated by reference.",
        "In ink jet printing tiny drops of ink fluid are projected directly onto an ink receptor surface without physical contact between the printing device and the receptor. The printing device stores the printing data electronically and includes a mechanism for ejecting the drops image-wise. Printing is accomplished by moving the print head across the paper or vice versa.",
        "The jetting of the ink droplets can be performed in several different ways. In a first type of process a continuous droplet stream is created by applying a pressure wave pattern. This process is known as continuous ink jet printing. In a first embodiment the droplet stream is divided into droplets which are electrostatically charged, deflected and collected, and into droplets that remain uncharged are undeflected and form the image. Alternatively, the charged deflected stream forms the image and the uncharged undeflected jet is collected. In this variant of continuous ink jet printing several jets are deflected to a different degree and thus record the image (multideflection system).",
        "According to a second process the ink droplets can be created \u201con demand\u201d (\u201cDOD\u201d or \u201cdrop on demand\u201d method) whereby the printing device ejects the droplets only when they are used in imaging on a receiver thereby avoiding the complexity of drop charging, deflection hardware, and ink collection. In drop-on-demand printing the ink droplet can be formed by means of a pressure wave created by a mechanical motion of a piezoelectric transducer (so-called \u201cpiezo method\u201d), or by means of discrete thermal pulses (so-called \u201cbubble jet\u201d method, or \u201cthermal jet\u201d method).",
        "Ink compositions for ink jet typically include the following ingredients: dyes or pigments, water and/or organic solvents, humectants such as glycols, detergents, thickeners, polymeric binders and preservatives. Ink compositions can be roughly divided into:\n\n    \n    \n        water-based inks, the drying mechanism involving absorption, penetration and evaporation;\n        oil-based inks, the drying involving absorption and penetration;\n        solvent-based inks, the drying primarily involving evaporation;\n        hot melt or phase change inks, in which the ink vehicle is liquid at the ejection temperature but solid at room temperature and in which drying is replaced by solidification;\n        UV-curable inks, in which drying is replaced by polymerization.",
        "The first two types of ink compositions require a receiving medium that is more or less absorptive, whereas solvent based inks, hot melt inks or UV-curable inks are more suitable for non-absorbent substrates.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,303,924 is an important basic patent on ink compositions for ink jet, satisfying the need for a low solvent content, and containing a UV-curable compound.

(2) POSS molecules are physically large, ranging from approximately 1 to 3 nm. This hybrid (organic/inorganic) composition of POSS technology enables it to occupy a unique and dramatically enhanced property space relative to traditional hydrocarbons and inorganics. An important benefit is that it affords the material formulations excellent thermal, mechanical and oxidative stability, as well as flammability resistance. This is largely due to the inorganic core of the POSS molecules. The organic portion of their composition provides improved compatibility with existing resins thereby enabling their facile incorporation into conventional plastics. POSS functionalized monomers according to the present invention possess a hybrid inorganic-organic three-dimensional structure which contains one to eight reactive organic functional groups.",
        "The majority of POSS functionalized monomers contain seven non-reactive organic groups with one unique functionality. By varying the functional group and the seven non-reactive organic groups, a multitude of POSS functionalized monomers can be prepared to meet almost any need. While the monofunctional POSS monomers can be incorporated by copolymerization or grafting, multifunctional POSS monomers can be utilized as effective cross-linkers. POSS functionalized monomers react similarly in polymerization, grafting and cross-linking reactions to standard organic monomers. While they react like simple organic monomers, when incorporated into a polymeric material, POSS functionalized monomers impart significant improvements in the thermal, mechanical, and gas separation properties of traditional plastics.",

        "Dendrimers",
        "According to a thirty-seventh embodiment of the radiation curable ink composition, according to the present invention, the radiation curable ink further comprises a dendrimer.",
        "Dendrimers are radially symmetrical molecules of a STARBURST\u2122. topology comprised of an initiator core, such as nitrogen, ethyleneimine, and the like, interior layers attached to the core and comprised of a suitable number of arms, for instance, two to four arms, each arm being comprised of repeating units with the number of repeating units in each arm being considered the generation of the dendrimer, and terminal groups functionality, such as, for example, a primary amine attached to the outmost generation, which dendrimers are illustrated, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,507,466, 4,631,337, 4,558,120, 4,568,737, and 4,587,329, and in Tomalia et al., Angewandte Chemie, Int. Ed. Engl. 29, 138 (1990). The size and shape of the STARBURST\u2122 dendrimer molecule and the functional groups present in the dendrimer molecule can be controlled by the choice of the initiator core, the number of generations, and the choice of repeating units employed at each generation.",
        "The choice of the dendrimer components can affect the properties of the dendrimers. The initiator core type can affect the dendrimer shape producing, for example, spheroid-shaped dendrimers, cylindrical- or rod-shaped dendrimers, or ellipsoid-shaped dendrimers. Sequential building of generations determines the dimensions of the dendrimers and the nature of its interior. Examples of suitable core materials include ammonia, polyfunctional alcohols, such as pentaerythritol or tris-(hydroxymethyl)ethane, 1,1,1-tris-(4\u2032-hydroxyphenyl)ethane, polyfunctional amines, such as ethylene diamine, linear polyethyleneimines, and the like. The chemical functionality of the repeating unit in the interior layers can include, for example, amidoamines, such as aminoethyl acetamide, imines, such as diethylene diimine, or ethers like those obtained from materials such as, for example, 3,5-dihydroxyethyl benzyl alcohol. The terminal functionalities include, for example, amino groups, hydroxyl groups, carboxylic acid groups, carboxylates, esters, amides, phosphates, sulfonates, and the like. The synthesis of dendrimers usually occurs by a divergent approach that involves the initial reaction of a monomer with the initiator core, followed by exhaustive reaction of the resulting functional groups with a difunctional compound, such as a diamine, including, for example, ethylene diamine, to afford the next generation of reactive amino groups. Thus, for example, ethylene diamine can be suitably reacted first with methyl acrylate to produce a compound such as N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetra(methoxycarbonylethyl)ethylene diamine. The aforesaid compound can be reacted in the next step with ethylene diamine to produce an amidoamine dendrimer having a generation number of zero, a molecular weight of 517, and four primary amino groups at the surface. Repetition of the above two-step procedure leads to subsequent generations.",
        "An alternate synthetic route uses a convergent growth synthesis as described in detail in Hawker et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 112, 7638 (1990).",
        "The dendrimer may have other groups or segments, in addition to amino groups. For instance, the dendrimer may have a dye covalently attached to it, or it may have certain functional groups grafted onto it. Preferred dendrimers for use in the preparation of the ink composition of the present invention include the dendrimers disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,312,679.",
        "The dendrimers may be grafted with, for example, alkylene oxide oligomers or polymers, wherein the alkylene has 1-12 carbon atoms and the degree of polymerization of the alkylene oxide is in the range of from about 2 to about 100. The amount of grafting can be in any suitable range, preferably below 50% of the amino groups, and even more preferably below 10% of the amino groups. Grafting of ethylene oxide on the dendrimer can be performed by any suitable means known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For instance, a polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether of suitable molecular weight can be converted to polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether p-toluene sulfonate by suitably reacting with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride and pyridine, and the sulfonate then reacted with the dendrimer under suitable conditions, as known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Grafted dendrimers can also be obtained from Dendritech, Inc. in Midland, Mich.",
        "Other preferred dendrimers for use in the preparation of the ink composition of the present invention include those having terminal amine functionality at the surface. It is further preferred that the dendrimer has a molecular weight in the range from about 300 to about 100,000, a generation number of from 0 to 10, a surface amine group concentration of from about 3 to about 4100, and a molecular diameter of from about 1 nm to about 1000 nm. More preferred dendrimers are those having terminal primary amine functionality. It is also more preferred that the dendrimer has a molecular weight in the range from about 500 to about 30,000, a generation number of from 0 to about 5, a surface group concentration of from about 4 to about 150, and a molecular diameter of from about 1 nm to about 150 nm.

Examples of dendrimers prepared by the divergent approach include the STARBURST\u2122 dendrimers available from Dendritech, Inc. These dendrimers from Dendritech, Inc. are polyamidoamines (PAMAMs) having primary amine terminal surface functionality, and made of ethylene diamine core and sequenced copolymers of ethylene diamine and methyl acrylate. They have a polydispersity index of 1.0007.",

        "Radiation Curing Apparatuses",
        "Apparatuses for radiation curing are known to those skilled in the art and are commercially available. For example, the curing proceeds with medium pressure mercury vapour lamps with or without electrodes, or pulsed xenon lamps. These ultraviolet sources usually are equipped with a cooling installation, an installation to remove the produced ozone and optionally a nitrogen inflow to exclude air from the surface of the product to be cured during radiation processing. An intensity of 40 to 240 W/cm in the 200-400 nm region is usually employed. An example of a commercially available ultraviolet medium-pressure electrodeless mercury vapour lamp is the model VPS/I600 curing system of Fusion UV systems Ltd., UK. A pulsed xenon flash lamp is commercially available from IST Strahlentechnik GmbH, Nurtingen, Germany. Using the Fusion model one has also the possibility to use metal halide doped Hg vapour or XeCl excimer lamps, each with its specific UV emission spectrum. This permits a higher degree of freedom in formulating the curing composition: a more efficient curing is possible using the lamp with the most appropriate spectral characteristics.",
