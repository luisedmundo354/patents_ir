        "This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/250,637 filed Nov. 30, 2000.",
        "The present invention relates to electronic commerce. Specifically, the present invention provides for a seller to select shoppers to provide buying privileges to buy an offering offered for sale by the seller within a network-based shopping facility such as, for example, an Internet-based shopping facility.",
        "More and more Internet users are realizing the ease and convenience of buying and selling online by way of person-to-person online trading pioneered by eBay Inc., the assignee of the present invention. As a result, collectors, hobbyists, small dealers, unique item seekers, bargain hunters, and other consumers are able to buy and sell millions of items at various online shopping sites.",
        "The success of the online shopping sites, such as the Internet-based shopping facilities, depends upon their ability to provide enjoyable shopping experiences and easy-to-use and reliable environments in which buyers and sellers can conduct business efficiently. The online shopping sites can offer their services by facilitating auctions or by allowing sellers to offer their offerings for fixed prices. The current Internet-based shopping facilities have been presented with public relations risks due to excessive bid retraction and cancellation activities. For example, the reputation of eBay Inc. as a safe trading place was threatened because of the excessive bid retraction and cancellation activities during the recent auction of the Titanic deck chair and other high profile listings. It is estimated that as many as eighty percent of the bids made on the Internet-based shopping facilities are bogus.",
        "In the light of the foregoing, there is a need to enhance the traders' trust of the online shopping facilities. Particularly, it would be valuable and useful to provide a seller with a degree of confidence that a specific shopper is sincere about bidding on the seller's auction listing or offering to buy the seller's fixed price listing.",
        "According to one aspect of the present invention, a method to facilitate network-based shopping comprising facilitating a communication between a network-based auction facility and a seller whereby the seller authorizes a bidder to bid on an offering offered for sale by the seller is disclosed.",
        "Furthermore, the method comprises automatically recording the bidder as authorized to bid on the offering responsive to the communication.",
        "Other features of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows.",
        "The present invention is illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which like references indicate similar elements, and in which:",
        "FIG. 1 is block diagram illustrating an exemplary network-based commerce facility in the form of an Internet-based auction facility 10;",

        "FIG. 10 illustrates the flow chart of one embodiment of the method for seller authorized bidding through an Internet-based auction facility.",
        "A method and system to implement seller authorized buying privileges within a network-based shopping facility are described. The present invention proposes a method and system whereby a seller can select shoppers to provide buying privileges to buy an offering offered for sale by the seller. The buying privileges can include the authorization to bid on the seller's auction listing and the authorization to offer to buy the seller's fixed price listing. A listing may, for example, comprise an item or service offering. In this description, the terms listing, item and offering are used interchangeably. Unauthorized bidders are blocked from bidding on the item.",
        "An advantage of the present invention is that the seller does not have to manually monitor shopping activities because only the shoppers pre-approved by the seller are allowed to bid on or offer to buy the seller's listing. The shoppers also benefit from the present invention because a healthier trading environment is created because only the pre-approved candidates are allowed to compete with them. The community benefits in general because the shopping facility is perceived to have a safer trading place for the community because only the serious shoppers are allowed to bid on and offer to buy the listings. Seller authorized buying privileges can be requested by any seller with privileges to list on the shopping facility and for any listing, although the sellers with high profile listings would have more interest to do so. The present invention is extremely useful for high profile listings: charity listings, special events and holiday promotions.",
        "In the ensuing description, a method and system to implement seller authorized buying privileges within a network-based auction facility are described. It will be appreciated that the method and system are also applicable to the fixed priced listings. In this description, the terms pre-approval and authorization are used interchangeably. In various embodiments, the seller is empowered to use different mechanisms to pre-approve bidders. For example, the seller may view a potential bidder's bidding history and profile to determine whether or not to pre-approve the bidder to bid on a listing. It is understood that if the vetting process is too strict, the conversion rate on the item will be affected. To mitigate, in one embodiment, the auction facility educates the sellers to use proper vetting mechanism to choose their bidders. Also, in one embodiment, the seller may remove the pre-approval restriction anytime during the auction. For example, the seller may wish to take the risk to open the listing to all potential bidders if the pre-approval restriction produces no bids or the bids amounts are low. In one embodiment, the seller may add and remove the pre-approval restriction multiple times during the auction.",
        "In one embodiment, the seller may remove a bidder from the pre-approved list after the seller has added the bidder to the pre-approved list. In one embodiment, the seller may add bidders to and remove bidders from the pre-approved list multiple times during the auction of the listing. In one embodiment, the seller may request the pre-approval of bidders for his/her listing without specifying any bidders initially, and then add the bidders to the pre-approved list from time to time. In one embodiment, the seller has the choice to apply the pre-approve bidders list from a prior or current listing to all ongoing listings with the auction facility and/or any future listings. In one embodiment, the seller may pre-approve the bidders individually or in a bulk. In one embodiment, the seller may view the list of the pre-approved bidders and their respective Usernames/email addresses by logging on to the auction facility web site and providing the listing identification number.",
        "In one embodiment, the bidders within the United States of America as well as international bidders may be pre-approved to bid on the listing. In one embodiment, only the predetermined currencies can be used to bid on a listing.",
        "In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.",
        "Unauthorized bidders include bidders who are not pre-approved by the seller to bid on a particular item. Authorized bidders include bidders who are pre-approved to bid on a particular item by the seller. Items include auction listings. Bidders include bidders and potential bidder.",
        "FIG. 1 is block diagram illustrating an exemplary network-based commerce facility in the form of an Internet-based auction facility 10. While an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is described within the context of an auction facility, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention will find application in many different types of computer-based, and network-based, commerce facilities.",
        "The auction facility includes an authorization module 40 and a communications module 42. The authorization module 40 includes the CGI servers 18 that provide an intelligent interface to the back-end of facility 10, database engine server 22 and database 23. The communications module 42 includes one or more of a number of types of front-end servers, namely the page servers 12 that deliver web pages (e.g., markup language documents), picture servers 14 that dynamically deliver images to be displayed within Web pages, listing servers 16, CGI servers 18, and search servers 20 that handle search requests to the facility 10. E-mail servers 21 provide, inter alia, automated e-mail communications to the users of the facility 10.",

If the seller were already logged on, then he/she need not logon again to use request the pre-approval restriction. The suspended, merged, or terminated seller who cannot use any other feature on the auction site is prohibited from using the seller authorized bidding feature. At block 904, the seller identifies the item for which he wishes to add the pre-approval restriction. At block 906, an alert text appears on the item web page to alert the potential bidders to get a pre-approval from the seller to bid on the item. The item web page or another web page linked to the item web page provides the potential bidder with the seller contact information and vetting process information. At block 908, the potential bidder contacts the seller and requests permission to bid on the item. It is understood that the bidder must be registered with and logged on to the auction web site. The bidder provides the seller with the bidder auction site identifier such as the Username or email address. At block 910, the seller uses the bidder's auction site identifier to retrieve the bidder's bidding history and profile information. At block 912, the seller determines whether to add the bidder to the pre-approve bidders list. At block 914, if the determination is positive, the seller adds the potential bidder identifier to the pre-approve bidders list. The bidder identifier is then added to an appropriate authorization table. At block 916, if the determination is negative, the bidder identifier is not added to the authorization table. In one embodiment, the potential bidder is informed through email that the seller has rejected his/her request for pre-approval. At block 918, the seller may edit the pre-approve bidder list.
