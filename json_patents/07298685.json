        "PHOTONICS DATA STORAGE SYSTEM USING A POLYPEPTIDE MATERIAL AND METHOD FOR MAKING SAME (PCT/FR01/02386) filed on Jul. 20, 2001.",
        "The present invention generally relates to a large volume diffractive optics memory. In particular, the present invention relates to an apparatus and method for recording information to and reading information from a multi-layer diffractive optics memory. Furthermore, the present invention relates to methods for making a multi-layer memory.",
        "The large storage capacities and relative low costs of CD-ROMS and DVDs have created an even greater demand for still larger and cheaper optical storage media. Holographic memories have been proposed to supersede the optical disc as a high-capacity digital storage medium. The high density and speed of the holographic memory comes from three-dimensional recording and from the simultaneous readout of an entire packet of data at one time. The principal advantages of holographic memory are a higher information density (1011 bits or more per square centimeter), a short random access time (\u02dc100 microseconds and less), and a high information transmission rate (109 bit/sec).",
        "In holographic recording, a light beam from a coherent monochromatic or multi-spectral source (e.g., a laser) is split into a reference beam and an object beam. The object beam is passed through a spatial light modulator (SLM) and then into a storage medium. The SLM forms a matrix of shutters (in the binary case) or, more generally, a matrix of photocells modulating the light intensity that represents a packet of data. The object beam passes through the SLM which acts to modulate the object beam with the binary information being displayed on the SLM. The modulated object beam is then directed to one point on the storage medium by a beam processor where it intersects with the reference beam to create a hologram representing the packet of data.",
        "An optical system consisting of lenses and mirrors is used to precisely direct the optical beam encoded with the packet of data to the particular spatially addressed area of the storage medium. Optimum use of the capacity of a thick storage medium is realized by spatial and angular multiplexing. In spatial multiplexing, a set of packets is stored in the storage medium shaped into a plane as an array of spatially separated and regularly arranged sub-holograms by varying the beam target in the x-axis and y-axis of the plane. Each sub-hologram is formed at a point in the storage medium with the rectangular coordinates representing the respective packet address as recorded in the storage medium. In angular multiplexing, recording is carried out by keeping the x- and y-coordinates the same while changing the irradiation angle of the reference beam in the storage medium. By repeatedly incrementing the irradiation angle, a plurality of packets of information is recorded as a set of sub-holograms at the same x- and y-spatial location.",
        "Previous techniques for recording information to a highly multiplexed volume holographic memory, and for subsequently reading the information from this memory are limited in memory capacity.",
        "It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for recording to and reading from a multi-layer diffractive optics memory capable of an extended storage capacity.",

A laser (not shown) emits a coherent light beam which is divided by a beam splitter (not shown) into a reference beam 1 and an object beam 4. The reference beam 1 is directed by an angular processing mirror 140 to one of the mirror elements 120 of the composite mirror device 110 which then aims the reference beam 1 onto one of the points 8a of the multi-layer diffractive optics memory 8. The object beam 4 is focused by a focusing lens 105 through a hole 125 in the composite mirror device 110 onto the point 8a where the object beam 4 interferes with the reference beam 1 creating a holographic interference pattern within the material of the diffractive optics memory 8.",
        "The multi-layer diffractive optics memory 8 is alternately referred to as a storage medium. The multi-layer diffractive optics memory 8 comprises a polypeptide material capable of storing information coated onto a recording plate. At the end of a recording process, the multi-layer diffractive optics memory 8 stores information therein. Two methods of creating a multi-layer diffractive optics memory will be described below.",
        "The object beam 4 is modulated by a display (not shown) with a packet of information 6 (see FIG. 2). The display (not shown) may be any display for displaying a data packet 6 in two dimensions such as a spatial light modulator (SLM) or a liquid crystal light valve (LCLV). The display comprises, for example, a liquid crystal display screen on which data is encoded in a two-dimensional pattern of transparent and opaque pixels. The data is input to the display via a computer (not shown) or by other digital data or analog origins. The plurality of bits represented on the display screen of the display as a two-dimensional pattern of transparent and opaque pixels is known as a data packet 6 (see FIG. 2). The data packed 6 displayed is derived from any source such as a computer program, the Internet, and so forth. In an Internet storage application, the packets displayed may be formatted similarly to the packets of the Internet. The object beam 4 becomes modulated by the information to be recorded by means of transmission through the display.",
        "The lasers, beam splitter and SLM devices for holographic recording have been developed in the art and further details can be found in the book Holographic Data Storage, Springer (2000) edited by H. J. Coufal, D. Psaltis, and G. T. Sincerbox.",
        "At the same time, the reference beam 1 undergoes reflection off the angular processing mirror 140 which can rotate so that the reference beam 1 arrives at one of the micro-mirrors 120 which are organized into sets of the composite mirror device 110 the orientation of which will modify the angle of incidence of the reference beam 1 with respect to the object beam 4, again in the region of the diffractive optics memory 8. Thus, by this process angular multiplexing is implemented.",
        "The angular processing mirror 140 has stability characteristics fitting the constraints of recording. The angular processing mirror 140 sends the reference beam 1 to the composite mirror device 110. The composite mirror device 110 comprises a plurality of mirror elements 120 spatially organized into rows and columns forming sets. Each of the mirror elements 120 has a specific spatial angular orientation. In one embodiment of the present invention, in every set (e.g., this could be a row) there are 50 mirrors to deflect the reference beam 1 at one of 50 angles and there are 50 rows of mirrors, one row for each of 50 planes of the mirror. Every set is oriented in a different way in order to process the beam to a different plane. In this embodiment, each point has 2500 packets of information stored therein (50 angles for each of 50 sets of mirror elements). Furthermore, a packet has a size of 800\u00d7600 bytes stored at a point 1 mm2. Thus the storage capacity is one terabits per centimeter squared.",
        "FIG. 2 shows a schematic of the important signals involved in recording a diffraction pattern, or alternately a hologram, in the diffractive optics memory 8 using angular and spatial multiplexing. Various diffractive recording processes have been developed in the art and further details can be found in the book Holographic Data Storage, Springer (2000) edited by H. J. Coufal, D. Psaltis, and G. T. Sincerbox. In forming a hologram, the reference beam 1 intersects with the object beam 4 to form a sub-hologram 8a (referred to alternately as a point) extending through the volume of storage medium 8. There is a separate sub-hologram or point 8a extending through the volume for each angle and spatial location of the reference beam 1. The object beam 4 is modulated with a packet of information 6. The packet 6 contains information in the form of a plurality of bits. The source of the information for the packet 6 can be a computer, the Internet, or any other information-producing source. The hologram impinges on the surface 8a of the storage medium 8 and extends through the volume of the storage medium 8. The information for the packet 6 is modulated onto the storage medium 8 by spatial multiplexing and angle multiplexing. Angle multiplexing is achieved by varying the angle \u03b1 of the reference beam 1 with respect to the surface plane of the storage medium 8. A separate packet 6 of information is recorded in the storage medium 8 as a sub-hologram for each chosen angle \u03b1 and spatial location. Spatial multiplexing is achieved by shifting the reference beam 1 with respect to the surface of the storage medium 8 so that the point 8a shifts to another spatial location, for example point 8a\u2032, on the surface of the storage medium 8. One embodiment for shifting the reference beam is to mechanically move the memory 8 in a -x or -y direction with respect to the reference beam.",
        "The storage medium 8 is typically a three-dimensional body made up of a material sensitive to a spatial distribution of light energy produced by interference of the object light beam 4 and the reference light beam 1. A hologram may be recorded in a medium as a variation of absorption or phase or both. The storage material must respond to incident light patterns causing a change in its optical properties. In a volume hologram, a large number of packets of data can be superimposed, so that every packet of data can be reconstructed without distortion. A volume (thick) hologram may be regarded as a superposition of three dimensional gratings recorded in the depth of the emulsion each satisfying the Bragg law (i.e., a volume phase grating). The grating planes in a volume hologram produce change in refraction and/or absorption.",
        "Several materials have been considered as storage material for optical storage systems because of inherent advantages. These advantages include a self-developing capability, dry processing, good stability, thick emulsion, high sensitivity, and nonvolatile storage. Some materials that have been considered for volume holograms are photofractive crystals, photopolymer materials, and polypeptide material.",
        "The diffractive optics memory 8 may be made of photopolymer materials, polypeptide material, and other such materials for optical recording. With a photopolymer the density storage will be much more limited than by using a polypeptide with a shorter life duration and a lower SNR and a lower tolerancing. Polypeptides are the only photo-material allowing stability, transparency to substantially all wavelengths, large diffraction efficiency, an angular tolerancing that can be programmed and controlled, and a very good stability over a large range of temperatures. Polypeptide can be protected against ultra-violet light, moisture, scratches and other physical constraints. Thus, preferably, the diffractive optics memory 8 is made of a polypeptide material.",
        "An embodiment of a polypeptide material suitable for the diffractive optics memory 8 is disclosed in the application PHOTONICS DATA STORAGE SYSTEM USING A POLYPEPTIDE MATERIAL AND METHOD FOR MAKING SAME (PCT/FR01/02386) filed on Jul. 20, 2001 and incorporated herein.",
        "FIG. 3 shows in greater detail the diffractive optics memory 8 arranged in the form of a flat sheet, herein referred to as a matrix. In this example, the matrix is 1 cm2. Each of a plurality of points on the matrix is defined by its rectilinear coordinates (x, y). An image-forming system (not shown) reduces the object beam 4 to the sub-hologram 8a having a minimum size at one of the x, y points of the matrix. A point in physical space defined by its rectilinear coordinates contains a plurality of packets 8b.",
        "In this case, a 1 mm2 image 8a is obtained by focusing the object beam 4 onto the storage medium 8 centered at its coordinate. Due to this interference between the two beams 1,4, a diffractive image 8a 1 mm2 in size is recorded in the storage medium 8 centered at the coordinates of the matrix. Spatial multiplexing is carried out by sequentially changing the rectilinear coordinates. The object beam 4 focuses on the storage medium 8 so that a separate image 8a is recorded at a unique position in the plane defined by its coordinates (x, y). This spatial multiplexing results in a 10 by 10 matrix of points (i.e. diffractive images) 8a. Angle multiplexing is carried out by sequentially changing the angle of the reference beam 1 by means of the composite mirror device 110 as described above. Angle multiplexing is used to create 25 packets of information 8b corresponding to 25 discrete variations of the angle of incidence of the reference beam. Experimental results show that 25 multiplexing angles are possible and this can be doubled, by a symmetric set-up to 50 angles. A data packet is reconstructed by shinning the reference beam 1 at the same angle and spatial location in which the data packed was recorded. The diffractive portion of the reference beam 1 diffracted by the storage medium 8 forms the reconstruction, which is typically detected by a detector array. The storage medium 8 may be mechanically shifted in order to store data packets at different points by its coordinates (x, y).",

Each of the micro-mirrors 120 has a specific orientation depending on its purpose (implemented function). The composite mirror 110 has a hole 125 in its center to allow the object beam 4 to cross through for the recording process. The hole 125 is not necessary for the subsequent reading process (see FIG. 8).",

In one of the embodiments of the present invention, there are 8 layers. A layer is coated on the surface of a glass or plastic substrate 150c. Each of the layers has a thickness of 30 microns of specially sensitized polypeptide material. On a single layer a maximum of 350 packets can be recorded. A memory with 8 layers allows for the storage of 2,500 packets of information (i.e. 2500 divided by 350 equals 8 rounded up).",
        "FIG. 4c illustrates the principal of recording using a plurality of planes 160. The multi-layer diffractive optics memory 8 is formed by coating a plurality of layers of polypeptide material on the plate substrate, e.g., glass or plastic. There is illustrate in FIG. 4c a plurality of planes 160 (e.g., 160a-160e). The set of mirrors with instances 120a, . . . , 120c is organized such that reference beams formed extending from the mirrors 120 to a single point 8a of the recording plate 8 all lie in the same plane. For example, the mirrors 120a, . . . 120c form reference beams which are all in the same plane 160e. Each set of micro-mirrors lie in a different plane. All the micro mirror from a set of micro-mirrors are located (their central perpendicular axis) in the same plane and all the reference beams are routed to the same point in the recording material.",
        "Several planes, including mirror axis, are located at different angles. This is to say that these planes share one straight line, and, that between each of these planes there is a determined angular value (see FIG. 4c). So every plane incorporates its own set of axis of micro-mirrors all these mirrors are thus routing the reference beams toward the same point.",
        "The number of these planes has a maximum value of 50 which has been experimentally checked to avoid cross talk. In one embodiment of the present invention, each plane comprises 50 micro-mirrors. The result of having 50 mirrors in 50 planes is 50\u00d750=2500 pages (packets) recorded on the same point of the recording plate.
