        "This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/595,814 entitled \u201cSub-Salt Pore Pressure Prediction,\u201d filed Aug. 8, 2005 in the names of Colin Michael Sayers and Richard Anthony Birchwood, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "Certain substances (e.g., salt, etc.) have low permeability, i.e., do not readily transmit fluids. In some cases, a low permeability substance may be located above a substance that is targeted by a drilling operation.",
        "FIG. 1 shows an exemplary diagram of a drilling operation. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the drilling operation shown in FIG. 1 is provided for exemplary purposes only and accordingly should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. For example, the drilling operation shown in FIG. 1 is a seafloor drilling operation, but the drilling operation may alternatively be a land drilling operation.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1, a drilling rig (105) is configured to drill into a formation (e.g., a formation below a seafloor (110)) using a drill bit (not shown) coupled to the distal end of a drill string (125). Specifically, the drill bit is used to drill a borehole (130) extending to a target substance (120). The target substance (120) may be hydrocarbon or a mineral resource targeted by a drilling operation. Further, as shown in FIG. 1, a low permeability substance (115) may be located above the target substance (120). Thus, to reach the target substance (120), the borehole (130) may be required to pass through the low permeability substance (115).",
        "When sediment of low permeability substance is buried or compacted, fluid may be trapped in pores within the resulting structure (i.e., within the low permeability substance itself and/or within substances beneath the low permeability substance (e.g., sand, etc.). Fluid trapped in this manner exerts pressure on the surrounding formation referred to as pore pressure. Formations in which pore pressure exceeds hydrostatic pressure at a given depth are referred to as overpressured.",
        "When drilling in an overpressured formation, the mud weight (i.e., the weight of drilling fluids transmitted to the borehole) must be high enough to prevent the pore pressure from moving formation fluids into the borehole. In the worst case, formation fluids entering a borehole may result in loss of the well and/or injury to personnel operating the drilling rig. Accordingly, for safe and economic drilling, it is essential that the pore pressure be predicted with sufficient accuracy. In particular, it is beneficial to predict pore pressure pre-drill, i.e., either before any drilling has commenced and/or at a location that the drill bit has not yet reached.",
        "Conventionally, pre-drill pore pressure prediction is based on the use of pre-drill seismic velocities and a velocity-to-pore pressure transform calibrated using offset well data (i.e., data from other wells near the drilling site). However, in some cases (e.g., when drilling under salt), conventional pre-drill pore pressure predictions may not be sufficiently accurate. Further discussion of conventional pre-drill pore pressure prediction techniques can be found in Sayers C M, Johnson G M, and Denyer G., 2002, \u201cPre-drill Pore Pressure Prediction Using Seismic Data,\u201d Geophysics, 67, 1286-1292.",
        "Mud is used in drilling operations to cool the drill bit, to transport cuttings generated by the drilling operation to the surface, to prevent the influx of formation fluids into the borehole, and to stabilize the borehole. With respect to preventing the influx of formation fluids, the drilling operator must maintain the mud weight at or above the pore pressure. With respect to stabilizing the borehole, drilling operators adjust the mud weight (i.e., the density of the mud being used) to counter the tendency of the borehole to cave in. However, the drilling operator must be careful not to fracture the formation by using an excessively high mud weight.",
        "Moreover, too high a mud weight may result in an unacceptably low drilling rate. Accordingly, the mud weight must be low enough to maintain an acceptable drilling rate and avoid fracturing the formation. In such cases, the allowable mud weight window (i.e., the range of allowable mud weights) may be small when drilling in overpressured formations. Specifically, the force exerted by the mud must fall within the range between the pore pressure (or the pressure to prevent a cave in, if higher than the pore pressure) and the pressure required to fracture the formation.",
        "Further, when drilling in overpressured formations, the number of required casing strings (i.e., structural supports inserted into the borehole) may be increased. Specifically, if a sufficiently accurate pre-drill pore pressure prediction is not available, additional casing strings may be inserted prematurely, to avoid the possibility of well control problems (e.g., influx of formation fluids) and/or borehole failure. Prematurely inserting casing strings may delay the drilling operation and/or reduce the size of the borehole and result in financial loss.",
        "In general, in one aspect, the invention relates to a method for pore pressure prediction. The method includes obtaining a stress sensitivity coefficient, obtaining a compressional wave (P-wave) velocity and a shear wave (S-wave) velocity for a pre-drill location, obtaining a first predicted pore pressure, iteratively performing: calculating a total stress value associated with the pre-drill location using the first predicted pore pressure associated with the pre-drill location; and calculating a second predicted pore pressure associated with the pre-drill location using a stress-pressure relationship equation, a stress-velocity relationship equation, the stress sensitivity coefficient, a reference location, and at least one selected from a group consisting of the P-wave velocity and the S-wave velocity for the pre-drill location, wherein iterating is complete if a difference between the first predicted pore pressure and the second predicted pore pressure is less than or equal to a threshold difference value, and wherein the first predicted pore pressure is updated using the second predicted pore pressure if the difference is greater than the threshold difference value, and adjusting a drilling operation associated with the pre-drill location, based on the second predicted pore pressure.",

In addition, the total stress, which is also expressed as a tensor, is also obtained for each location (i.e., L0, L1, L2).",

        "Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the exemplary stress-pressure relationship in equations (1) and (2) relies on the fact that while vertically propagating P-waves are mostly sensitive to changes in the component of the effective stress acting parallel to the direction of propagation, S-waves are sensitive to changes in both the component of the effective stress acting parallel to the direction of propagation and the component of the effective stress acting parallel to the direction of polarization. Further discussion of these underlying facts can be found in Sayers, C. M., 2004, \u201cMonitoring production-induced stress changes using seismic waves,\u201d 74th SEG Annual Meeting, Extended Abstracts. Specifically, since the directions of propagation and polarization are approximately parallel for the P-wave and orthogonal for the S-wave, the combination of the P-wave and S-wave velocities allows perpendicular components of the effective stress to be determined separately, thus allowing a determination of the pore pressure, and principal stresses.",

For example, a finite element model used in the finite element analysis may include the pre-drill location and one or more locations in one or more offset wells. Performing the finite element analysis may also involve calculating a total stress variation across one or more depths (e.g., above, below, and/or around the low permeability substance) using the predicted pore pressure. For example, boundary stress conditions may be obtained from offset wells and used to estimate total stress values at the pre-drill location.

        "With respect to the reference, the variables in equations (11)-(12) are defined as follows: \u03bdP(SV, Sh, p) is the P-wave velocity associated with the pre-drill location, and \u03bdS(SV, Sh, p) is the S-wave velocity associated with the pre-drill location; \u03bdP(0) is a reference P-wave velocity associated with the reference location; \u03bdS(0) is a reference S-wave velocity associated with the reference location; \u03b1PV is the vertical compressional stress sensitivity coefficient obtained in Step 305; \u03b1Ph is the horizontal compressional stress sensitivity coefficient obtained in Step 305; \u03b1SV is the vertical shear stress sensitivity coefficient obtained in Step 305; \u03b1Sh is the horizontal shear stress sensitivity coefficient obtained in Step 305; S\u03bd is the total vertical stress; Sh is the total horizontal stress; p is the pore pressure; the terms preceded by \u0394 represent the difference between values at the pre-drill location and the reference location; and \u03b1 is the poroelastic coefficient.",
        "Using equation (11) and/or equation (12) with values obtained in the previous steps, \u0394p may be determined. \u0394p may then be added to the pore pressure at the reference location to obtain the second predicted pore pressure.",
        "Continuing with discussion of FIG. 3, in one or more embodiments of the invention, in Step 330, the predicted pore pressure used in Step 320 (hereinafter the \u201cfirst\u201d predicted pore pressure) may be compared with the predicted pore pressure calculated in Step 325 (hereinafter the \u201csecond\u201d predicted pore pressure). Specifically, one or more metrics of the differences between the first and second predicted pore pressures may be compared with one or more threshold difference values. In one or more embodiments of the invention, a threshold difference value may be a maximum value of the metric of differences indicating that the second predicted pore pressure is sufficiently accurate. In one embodiment of the invention, a second predicted pore pressure is determined to be sufficiently accurate when |(PP1\u2212PP2)/PP1|\u22660.001, where PP1 denotes the first predicted pore pressure and PP2 denotes the second predicted pore pressure. Those skilled in the art would appreciate that other values for the threshold difference value may be used and that other mathematical constructs for the metric of the differences may be used. The threshold difference value may correspond to any other value less than 1.",
        "In one or more embodiments of the invention, if the differences between the first and second predicted pore pressures are greater than the threshold difference value in Step 330, then in Step 335 the first predicted pore pressure is updated using the second predicted pore pressure. In this case, Step 320 is subsequently repeated using the first updated predicted pore pressure. In one or more embodiments of the invention, if Step 320-325 are repeated, current data gathered while drilling may be used (e.g., seismic wave velocities, stress data, etc.). For example, the current data may be gathered using measurements while drilling (MWD), logging while drilling (LWD), any other similar type of drilling data, or any combination thereof. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that using more current data and/or data from a location closer to the pre-drill location may improve the accuracy of the calculated total stress value. Further, those skilled in the art will appreciate that \u201cupdating\u201d the first predicted pore pressure may simply imply that Step 320 is repeated using the predicted pore pressure calculated in Step 325.",
        "In one or more embodiments of the invention, Steps 320 and 325 may be iteratively performed (i.e., via Steps 330 and 335) until the difference between the first and second predicted pore pressures are less than or equal to the threshold difference values in Step 330. Said another way, Steps 320 and 325 may be repeated until the first and second predicted pore pressures have sufficiently converged (e.g., the difference between the first and second predicted pore pressure is \u22660.1%.).",
        "In one or more embodiments of the invention, if the differences between the first and second predicted pore pressures are less than or equal to the threshold difference value(s) in Step 330, then in Step 340 the drilling operation associated with the pre-drill location may be adjusted based on the second predicted pore pressure. Specifically, in one or more embodiments of the invention, adjusting the drilling operation may involve adjusting a drilling fluid density (i.e., increasing or decreasing the drilling fluid density as appropriate), adjusting a drilling trajectory (e.g., to avoid an overpressured area, to pass through a low-pressure area, etc.), optimizing the number of casing strings in the borehole (i.e., adding a casing string, delaying addition of a casing string, etc.), or any other similar type of adjustment.",
        "In one embodiment of the invention, if a proposed well trajectory is situated in the vicinity of a complex structure that perturbs the surrounding stress-field (e.g., salt) and the proposed well trajectory passes through a highly permeable formation (e.g., sand), then the pore pressure in the highly permeable formation may be determined using any of the available techniques for determining pore pressure in such a formation.",
        "For example, if shale (a low permeability substance) interfaces with a sand (a high permeability), then an offset well may be drilled in the shale and the pore pressure in the shale may be determined using, for example, acoustic or seismic velocities. The pore pressure in the shale may then be used to obtain the pore pressure in the sand using, for example, the centroid method. A particular version of the centroid method is described in the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) Application with the serial number WO 2004/022905 and assigned to the assignee of the present application. Alternatives to the centroid method include numerical basin modeling. Once the pore pressure in the sand has been determined, the pore pressure may be used to validate the various stress sensitivity coefficients and/or the model used to generate the total stress at the pre-drill location.",
        "In one embodiment of the invention, wireline and/or logging while drilling (LWD) tools are used to obtain pore pressure measurements for a location in an offset well, where the location is in a sand and the sand extends to a pre-drill location. In such cases, the pore pressure at the pre-drill location may be estimated using the pore pressure obtained at the location in the offset well and information about the hydrostatic gradient (defined by the fluid density) between the location in the offset well and the pre-drill location. Once the pore pressure in the sand has been determined at the pre-drill location, the pore pressure may be used to validate the various stress sensitivity coefficients and/or the model used to generate the total stress at the pre-drill location.",
        "In one embodiment of the invention, downhole measurements obtained while drilling in the target borehole (i.e., the borehole whose trajectory intersects with the pre-drill location) may be used to update the stress sensitivity coefficients and/or the model used to generate the total stress at the pre-drill location. These coefficients may then be used to predict the pore pressure ahead of the bit using seismic velocities or velocities obtained using a multi-offset VSP.",
        "One or more embodiments of the invention provide a means for accurately predicting a pre-drill pore pressure. Accordingly, one or more embodiments of the invention may prevent formation fluids from entering a borehole, thereby preventing damage to the well and/or personnel operating a drilling rig. Further, one or more embodiments of the invention may prevent the financial overhead of prematurely inserting casing strings.",
        "The invention may be implemented on virtually any type of computer regardless of the platform being used. For example, as shown in FIG. 4, a computer system (400) includes a processor (402), associated memory (404), a storage device (406), and numerous other elements and functionalities typical of today's computers (not shown). The computer (400) may also include input means, such as a keyboard (408) and a mouse (410), and output means, such as a monitor (412). The computer system (400) may be connected to a network (414) (e.g., a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet, or any other similar type of network) via a network interface connection (not shown). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that these input and output means may take other forms.",
        "Further, those skilled in the art will appreciate that one or more elements of the aforementioned computer system (400) may be located at a remote location and connected to the other elements over a network. Further, the invention may be implemented on a distributed system having a plurality of nodes, where each portion of the invention (e.g., stress sensitivity coefficient calculator, total stress calculator, pore pressure calculator, etc.) may be located on a different node within the distributed system. In one embodiment of the invention, the node corresponds to a computer system. Alternatively, the node may correspond to a processor with associated physical memory. The node may alternatively correspond to a processor with shared memory and/or resources. Further, software instructions to perform embodiments of the invention may be stored on a computer readable medium such as a compact disc (CD), a diskette, a tape, a file, or any other computer readable storage device. In addition, in one embodiment of the invention, the predicted pore pressure (including all the pore pressures calculated using the method described in FIG. 3) may be displayed to a user via a graphical user interface (e.g., a display device).",
        "While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art, having benefit of this disclosure, will appreciate that other embodiments can be devised which do not depart from the scope of the invention as disclosed herein. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be limited only by the attached claims."
