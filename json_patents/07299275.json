        "The present invention relates to a contents delivery system and a contents delivery method for delivering large-capacity contents upon users' requests.",
        "2. Description of the Prior Art",
        "Conventionally, to deliver large-capacity contents such as movies to user terminals, CDN (Contents Delivery Network) has intervened between an archive server storing contents in large quantity and the user terminals because only use of the Internet is insufficient. The CDN is a network in which edge servers serving as relay servers located in respective regions are connected, wherein the edge servers are stored with a large number of contents probably favorite to users. Thereby, by accessing the edge servers without directly accessing the archive server, the users can view favorite contents in a relatively short time in the form of streaming or by downloading them. On the other hand, a technology for automatically delivering contents has been developed. According to the technology, large-capacity storage devices such as hard disk drives are connected to user terminals, and according to contracts with a system administrator, desired contents are automatically delivered directly to the hard disk drives within homes from an archive server through an artificial satellite or the Internet. Therefore, according to such a satellite delivery system, the users can view desired contents at favorite times.",
        "However, in the case of a contents delivery system in which edge servers intervene between an archive server and user terminals, although the edge servers store relatively popular contents, they may not match actual users' preferences, in which case the users may directly access the archive server through the Internet. Repeated occurrence of such a situation would increase the load on the archive server and the Internet, make it difficult to maintain a given service quality, and lose opportunities to provide services for customers, damaging reliability for the system. Also, since the edge servers installed at very high cost are not effectively used, the withdrawal of invested costs may become slow.",

        "Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.",
        "FIG. 1 shows an overall configuration of a contents delivery system in a first embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 1, a center device 1, in addition to basic computer functions, has a viewing results collection part 2, a viewing results analysis part 3, a contents allocation control part 4, a portal creation part 5, a price decision part 6, and a content delivery management part 7, which are connected with each other through a bus 8. The contents allocation control part 4 is connected with an archive server 9 through a network. The archive server 9 is connected with a contents delivery network CDN 10 through the network. An edge server 11 installed for each area of the CDN 10 is connected with user terminals 12 through ADSL, cable television line, or the like. The user terminals 12 each has a terminal 13 and a hard disk drive 14, wherein the terminal 13 is connected with an edge server 11 installed in a corresponding area. On the other hand, the archive server 9 is connected with a broadcasting device 15, which is wirelessly connected with the user terminals 12 through an artificial satellite 16. The center device 1 is directly connected with the user terminals 12 through the Internet 17.",
        "The user terminals 12 can automatically store contents in the hard disk drives 14 from the archive server 9 through the artificial satellite 16 or Internet 17. In this case, the user must make a contract with an administrator (or manager of enterprise) of the center device 1 for viewing. A form of the contract is basically the same for all terminals in that charges are paid for viewing; in this case, the center device delivers contents most likely to be viewed to the user. As another form, contents of a user-specified jenre are delivered and the user pays charges for each of delivered contents. The center device 1 delivers contents to the user terminals 12 periodically or for each new release through the artificial satellite 16 or the Internet 17 and automatically stores or updates them in the hard disk drives 14. According to the automatic storage and updating, the user can automatically collect contents having high viewing results without performing special operations. In the case where the user terminals 12 are delivered with contents from the edge servers 11 of CDN 10, if an administrator of the CDN 10 is the same as the administrator of the center device 1, the user must make a contract with an administrator of the center device 1 for viewing. If the administrator of the CDN 10 is different from the administrator of the center device 1, the user must make a contract with both of them for viewing.",
        "The content delivery management part 7 of the center device 1 manages numerous contents within the archive server 9, region-conscious contents having high viewing results within the edge servers 11, and contents most likely to be viewed within the hard disk drives 14 in the user terminals 12. Contents stored within the archive server 9 are catalog contents viewed by a small number of users; individual contents are infrequently viewed but accesses to the category are many in total. Contents stored in the edge servers 11 are popular contents accessed by comparatively many users. Contents stored in the hard disk drives 14 of the user terminals 12 are very popular contents on which access is expected to concentrate at the first rental release.",
        "A description will be made of an overall flow of the contents delivery system in the first embodiment with reference to FIG. 2. The center device 1 obtains a user's desired genre according to a viewing contract with the user, initially allocates selected contents to the user terminal 12 of the user, the edge servers 11 in a region in which the user resides, and the archive server 9, and creates a portal (step S1). Alternatively, contents may be allocated with the same contents across the country. Next, a trial is made with the contents allocation for a given period of time to obtain viewing results, that is, collect use frequencies by the viewing results collection part 2 during the period of the trial (step S2). The collected viewing results are ranked after being analyzed as to user's age, sex, occupation, residence region, use frequency, and the like by the viewing results analysis part 3 (step S3). Next, an examination is made of contents relocation from the obtained analysis result (step S4). Contents expected to probably become popular may fall short of their expectation, while contents without expectation may become popular. In this case, the contents may be relocated by residence region or network infrastructure taking partial infrastructures among residence regions into account. Network infrastructures do not always depend on regions; for example, a distance between Tokyo and Osaka may be shorter in terms of network than a distance between Tokyo and Sizuoka. If new contents have been already registered at that time, the new contents are taken into account (step S9). At termination of the examination, the portal creation part 5 creates a portal, based on the result of the examination (step S5). The portal is a title screen that indicates what contents can be viewed, and involves portal editing operations (step S10). The price decision part 6 makes an examination of the price of the contents to be used, revises it if necessary, and reflects the result in the portal (step S6). Therefore, the order of steps S6 and S5 may be reverse as shown in FIG. 3. The purchase of service is a tradeoff with costs as in the purchase of products; too costly products will not be used. Accordingly, contents infrequently used are reduced in price to promote the use of them. Also, as a time service, their prices are reduced only in time zones in which they are infrequently used, to promote the use of them. After contents allocation, portal creation, and price decision are thus performed, the contents allocation control part 4 relocates contents to the archive server 9, the edge servers 11, and the user terminals 12 (step S7), releases the created portal, and executes the service (step S8). The result of the service execution is sent as data from the user terminals 12 to the content delivery management part 7 through the Internet 17 of the center device 1, and viewing results are collected in the viewing results collection part 2 and analyzed in the viewing results analysis part 3. The above-described steps are repeated.",
        "Next, a detailed description will be made of contents relocation processing in the center device 1. Optimum contents relocation, which is performed periodically, say every day or every week, is performed from the user terminals 12, wherein the archive server 9 is upstream and the user terminals 12 are downstream. Contents are relocated using the concept of \u201cshelf dropout\u201d and \u201cshelf keeping\u201d. The term \u201cshelf dropout\u201d means relocation from downstream terminals or servers to upstream servers; basically, identical contents are allocated to servers of identical storage levels. The term \u201cshelf keeping\u201d means relocation from upstream servers to downstream servers or terminals. To perform \u201cshelf dropout\u201d and \u201cshelf keeping\u201d, use frequencies for the contents are used as a parameter so that values less than a given shelf dropout threshold value are defined as \u201cshelf dropout\u201d and values beyond the threshold value are defined as \u201cshelf keeping\u201d. Contents likely to depend on current factors, e.g., contents expected to become popular in association with planned promotion of related products from a next week are distargeted for \u201cshelf dropout\u201d at the time of periodical optimum allocation. This setting is manually flagged as \u201cexclusion from application of shelf dropout\u201d. Based on users' viewing results, use frequencies for contents are used as a parameter so that price revision is made if a given price reduction threshold value is not satisfied.",
        "FIG. 4 shows the contents of contents attribute data recorded in a contents management table for managing contents in the content delivery management part 7 of the center device 1. The following data are recorded: management ID, title, running time, genre, summary, performers, viewing limitation level (R-rated, etc.), storage level, URL, data storage location within server, encode, price, attribute, valid period, display location within the portal, access ranking, access count, and the like. FIG. 5A is a data configuration diagram showing the contents of a server storage level management table for URIs; a storage level 0 targets the archive server 9, a storage level 1 targets five edge servers of edge server group 1, and a storage level 2 targets 100 edge servers of edge server group 2. In the case where the edge servers 11 consist of one stage as shown in FIG. 1, there are three types of storage levels: \u201c0\u201d of the archive server 9, \u201c1\u201d of the edge servers 11, and \u201c2\u201d of the user terminals 12. FIG. 5B shows a table of shelf dropout threshold values and price reduction threshold values classified by storage level; the shelf dropout threshold values and price reduction threshold values are based on access count, and greater values are set toward a downstream direction so that the user terminals 12 of storage level n+1 are set to the greatest value. FIG. 6A shows a terminal setting management table in which viewing limitation indication, viewing limitation level, viewing limitation cancel password, viewing history display indication, line speed (bps), and the like are defined. FIG. 6B shows the configuration of viewing history management data in the user terminals 12 which consists of management ID, title, view date, URL (indicates what file (contents) was actually viewed), and other data.",
        "Contents relocation processing in the center device 1 begins with the content delivery management part 7 checking contents stored in the user terminals 12, edge servers 11, and archive server 9. That is, the processing is performed toward upstream from downstream. FIG. 7 shows the checking of contents stored in the user terminals 12. In FIG. 7, an access ranking of contents is created from collected and analyzed viewing results (step S11). According to the ranking, individual contents are checked to determine whether they exceed shelf dropout threshold values (step S12), and if they exceed the threshold values, the storage state is kept intact; this processing is performed for all stored contents (step S13). Otherwise, if the contents are excluded from application of shelf dropout, they are kept stored intact (step S14). If the contents are not excluded from application of shelf dropout, the storage level of the contents is set to one lower level, which is the storage level of the edge servers 11 (step S15).",
        "FIG. 8 shows the checking of stored contents in the edge servers 11. In FIG. 8, after an access ranking is created (step S21), individual contents stored in the edge servers 11 are checked to determine whether they exceed shelf dropout threshold values at a current storage level (step S22), and if so, the contents are checked to determine whether they exceed shelf dropout threshold values of the user terminals 12 of one higher storage level (downstream side) (step S23). If so, the user terminals 12 are checked for free storage (or available storage) (step S24), and if free storage exists, the storage level of the contents is set higher by one to perform shelf keeping (step S25). This processing is performed for all contents stored in the edge servers 11 (step S26). In step 21, in the case where the shelf dropout threshold values are not exceeded, if the contents are excluded from application of shelf dropout, they are kept stored intact (step S27). If the contents are not excluded from application of shelf dropout, the storage level of the contents is set to one lower level (upstream side), which is the storage level of the archive server 9 (step S28).",
        "FIG. 9 shows storage contents check processing in the archive server 9. In FIG. 9, individual contents stored in the archive server 9 are checked to determine whether they exceed shelf dropout threshold values of the edger server 11 of one higher level (downstream side) (step S31). If so, the edge servers 11 is checked for free storage (step S32), and if free storage exists, the contents are transferred to the edge servers 11, that is, to perform shelf keeping (step S33). This processing is performed for all contents stored in the archive server 9 (step S34). Thus, in the archive server 9, only shelf keeping is taken into account because shelf dropout does not occur. Conversely, if downstream edge servers 11 and user terminals 12 have free storage, even if threshold values are not exceeded, shelf keeping may be performed to effectively use shelves.",
        "In this way, storage contents check processing in the user terminals 12, edge servers 11, and archive server 9 is performed in the contents delivery management part 7, shelf dropout or shelf keeping is performed based on shelf dropout threshold values, and then the contents allocation control part 4 relocates the contents according to storage levels set in the contents management table, so that contents in the user terminals 12, edge servers 11, and archive server 9 are optimally allocated.",
        "Next, a detailed description will be made of automatic creation of contents in the portal creation part 5 of the center device 1 and price decision processing in the price decision part 6. In the case where contents have been relocated, portal contents must be created to reflect the relocated contents. In this case, the contents are allocated so that the users are easily accessible to or prompted to access the contents stored in the user terminals 12 and the edge servers 11. The contents management table is provided with portal display location data indicating a display location within the portal, as shown in FIG. 4, and the portal is automatically created based on the data. The portal display location data contains a rank; for a higher rank, the contents are displayed in a more conspicuous place so that all contents are placed in descending order of rank. The portal display location data may be automatically created from an access ranking or intentionally created with some intention of the administrator.",
        "When a portal is created, contents prices are revised if given price reduction threshold values are not satisfied. For example, prices are reduced for contents that are not subject to shelf dropout but are infrequently accessed. By monitoring or statistically analyzing the situation of access to the edge servers 11, dynamic price revisions such as discounting in idle time zones may be made. If a price has been reduced, the attribute of price reduction is set in the contents management table of the contents delivery management part 7. This makes it possible to recognize a relationship between contents price revisions and viewing results.",
        "FIG. 10 shows portal automatic creation processing in the portal creation part 5. In FIG. 10, an access ranking after execution of relocation is obtained from the contents allocation control part 4 (step S41), and a ranking table is consulted to determine whether individual contents exceed price reduction threshold values (step S42). If so, the prices are kept intact, and if they do not exceed, the prices of the contents are revised based on a predetermined reduction range (step S43), and this processing is performed for all contents (step S44). If necessary, the portal display location data is changed to place contents ranked low in higher positions (step S45). A portal is automatically created based on portal display location data appended to individual contents (step S46). This processing is performed beginning with contents stored in the downstream user terminals 12, then for contents stored in the edge servers 11. Since the archive server 9 stores all other contents not stored in the user terminals 12 and the edge servers 11, the contents are offered by having the users perform a search based on contents attributes and the like.",
        "The edge servers 11 are dispersively disposed, e.g., on a region basis, and portal contents are created to allow the users to automatically access an optimum server when they access contents. FIG. 11 shows a portal screen displayed in the user terminals 12, which displays additional information 21, title 22, running time 23, service type 24, button 25 for viewing details, and button 26 for viewing contents. The user terminals 12 obtain portal contents having identical contents from the center device 1 (except links to the contents) but have different display contents, depending on the state and settings of the terminals. The portal contents contain, in addition to information (title, time, etc.) actually displayed, contents attribute data shown in FIG. 4 as meta-information of the contents themselves (information about the contents themselves, and attribute information). Portal contents delivered from the center device 1 to the user terminals 12 are offered through the Internet 17 or directly delivered in the hard disk drives 14 of the user terminals 12 over broadcasting from the artificial satellite 16. In the case of the former, since the portal is dynamically changed because the Internet is used, contents not stored are also included. In the case of the latter, since dynamic relocation of contents of the edge servers 11 and the archive server 9 is not supported, only contents to be stored are targeted. Contents not stored are dynamically displayed depending on a contents storage state. For broadcasting storage that is not always perfect for storage, \u201cnot stored\u201d or \u201ccoming soon\u201d is displayed for contents not stored. In the case where price information displayed in the portal is statically determined, a price display can be changed depending on time by including plural prices and time zones in advance in the portal contents and displaying prices corresponding to a current time at the time of displaying to the user terminals 12. At that time, time sale marks are also displayed to enable application to time-fixed time services.",
        "For the additional information 21 of FIG. 11, attention marks are mainly used to attract users' attention. The attention marks are provided by the user terminals 12 from contents attribute data or in advance attached to the portal contents sent from the center device 1. \u201cNew\u201d is attached to products newly released that are within a given period after the start of a contents valid period, e.g., two months after the contents become viewable. \u201cRecommend\u201d are attached to recommendable products. \u201cDiscount\u201d is attached to products reduced in price. \u201cTime Sale\u201d is attached to products targeted for time sale. \u201cSoon closed\u201d is attached to products soon closed that are within a given period before the end of a contents valid period, e.g., one week before contents viewing end. Title 22 indicates contents arranged in descending order of popularity. Service type 24 indicates contents storage locations. \u201cHDD\u201d indicates the hard disk drive 14 of the user terminals 12. \u201cStream\u201d indicates that streaming from the edge servers 11 is possible. \u201cDownload\u201d indicates that downloading from the archive server 9 is possible, displaying download time matching communication environments of individual terminals (described later). \u201cR-rated\u201d is not displayed in the portal as a rule; levels set in the user terminals and levels set in individual contents are compared, and whether to make a display is selected in the user terminals.",
        "FIG. 12 shows an example of portal contents residing on plural pages 31, 32, 33, and 34. Priorities of portal display location data are higher toward preceding pages, and higher toward upper positions on one page. Contents extending onto plural pages may be divided into \u201cHDD\u201d page 41, \u201cStream\u201d page 42, and \u201cDownload\u201d page 43 by storage location, as shown in FIG. 13. In the figure, \u201cNot stored\u201d mark 44 and \u201cAlready viewed\u201d mark 45 are displayed. The \u201cAlready viewed\u201d mark 45 may be optionally selected by the users to hold privacy for fear that what was viewed previously is revealed to others.",
        "The center device 1 periodically checks network environments used by the user terminals 12, measures a line speed from previous download results, and sets a line speed item of terminal setting management data shown in FIG. 6A. Based on the information, download time is estimated and displayable contents are selected. Contents which cannot be viewed in the current environment are not displayed. FIG. 14A shows a display example in the user terminals 12 with fast line speeds, and FIG. 14B shows a display example in the user terminals 12 with slow line speeds. In the case of FIG. 14B, \u201cStream\u201d is erased from the portal screen because stream contents cannot be viewed, and download contents take twice as long to download.",
        "In the contents delivery system as described above, although the edge servers 11 of CDN 10 consist of one stage as shown in FIG. 1, the edge servers 11 may consist of a multistage group such as 11A, 11B, and 11C as shown in FIG. 15. FIG. 16 shows its detailed structure. Logically, downstream of the archive server 9 is disposed an edge server 11A of first stage group, downstream of the edge server 11A of the first stage group is disposed an edge server 11B of second stage group, downstream of the edge server 11B of the second stage group is disposed an edge server 11C of third stage group, and downstream of the edge server 11C of the third stage group are disposed the user terminals 12, wherein they each are connected to network N so that the user terminals 12 can gain access directly to the edge servers 11A, 11B, and 11C of the groups and the archive server 9 through the network N. The archive server 9 is set to storage level \u201c0\u201d, the edge server 11A to storage level \u201c1\u201d, the edge server 11B to storage level \u201c2\u201d, and the edge server 11C to storage level \u201c3\u201d; they match the contents of the server storage level management table for URIs shown in FIG. 5A. The edge servers 11 increase in number toward downstream and respond more appropriately to an increase in access to contents toward downstream. Between the user terminals 12 and the edge server 11C, between the edge servers 11C and 11B, between the edge servers 11B and 11A, and between the edge server 11A and the archive server 9, contents can be interchanged by the above-described method. Therefore, in the contents delivery system shown in FIG. 15, since only contents very popular with the users can be accommodated in the edge server 11C closest to the user terminals 12, not only the load on the edge server 11C can be reduced but also contents can be interchanged with the edge server 11B of the next stage immediately according to changes in the popularity of the contents. Consequently, the contents can be flexibly and optimally relocated among the edge servers. Also, a preference tendency of users can be immediately reflected, and local-color-rich and elaborate contents delivery becomes possible. As a result, the user terminals 12 will be stored with only contents most likely to be viewed.",
        "Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. The first embodiment is achieved in global and relatively large network systems, while the second embodiment can be achieved even in narrower and smaller network systems. FIG. 17 shows the configuration of a contents delivery system in the second embodiment. A data delivery device 51 is connected to plural receiving terminals 60 through a network 59. The data delivery device 51 has a center server 52 controlling management information of the whole system, an archive server 52 storing contents for offering service, and an edge server 54 for dispersively processing accesses to contents from contents users. The edge server 54 and the center server 52 of the data delivery device 51 each are connected to the network 59, and the center server 52 can send and receive data directly to and from the receiving terminal 60 to receive contract data and viewing data. Plural edge servers may be dispersively disposed as in the first embodiment.",
        "The center server 52 comprises: a contents automatic allocation control part 55 that analyzes the situation of access to contents from contents users, and directs the archive server 53 or edge server 54 to allocate contents according to the result of analyzing the situation of access to the contents; a portal data management part 56 that creates and manages portal data for guiding the contents users according to the result of analyzing the situation of access to the contents; a contract data management part 57 that manages contract data about contracts with the contents users to view contents; and a contents use frequency data creation part 58 that checks the use frequencies of individual contents and creates contents use frequency data by analyzing the contract data. The contents automatic allocation control part 55 directs the archive server 53 or edge server 54 to relocate contents according to the quality or popularity of contents provided to the contents users. The portal data management part 56 guides contents users by arranging contents in the order of popularity or conspicuously arranging emphasized contents according to the result of analyzing the situation of access to the contents. The contract data management part 57 performs discount processing for individual contents according to the result of analyzing the situation of access to contents and promotes the use of emphasized contents and the use of contents in idle time zones. The receiving terminal 60 has a portal service presenting part 61 that uses portal data received from the data delivery device 51 to visually show the existence of contents to contents users.",
        "A contents delivery method in the data delivery device 51 in the second embodiment will be described with reference to FIG. 18. An overall flow is the same as in the above-described first embodiment. The center server 52 controls management information of the whole system (step S51) extracts a viewing tendency of users from contract data managed in the contract data management part 57, and dispersively stores the contents to be provided in the archive server 53 and edge server 54 (step S52). The center server 52 sends a portal created in the portal data management part 56 to the receiving terminals 60 through the network 59 to prompt the users for access by showing them the portal in the portal service presenting part 61 (step S53) of the receiving terminals 60 (step S53). While contents accesses to the edge server 54 from plural contents users are dispersively processed, the contents use frequency data creation part 58 of the center server 52 analyzes the situation of contents accesses by contents users (step S54), and according to the result of analyzing the contents access situation, the contents automatic allocation control part .55 directs the archive server 53 and edge server 54 to relocate contents (Step S55). The portal data management part 56, according to the result of analyzing the contents access situation, creates new portal data for guiding the contents users and provides it to the receiving terminals 60 of the users again (step S56). By thus performing the same processing as in the first embodiment, contents can be dynamically and optimally relocated in the archive server 53 and edge server 54, and the maintenance of service quality and the efficient operation of the system can be achieved.",
        "In the second embodiment, if the receiving terminals 60 not only perform streaming for contents from the edge server 54 but also are provided with hard disk drives to store contents downloaded from the edge server 54 therein, the users can view the contents at convenient times. There may be provided plural edge servers 54 each of which is connected to the network 59, or the edge server 54 may consists of multiple stages each of which is connected to the network 59, thereby enabling quick response to various requests of contents users.",
        "By creating the method of the present invention as a program usable to computers, contents delivery management can be performed using computers. By recording the program in storage media usable to computers, the computers can be operated through the recording media.",
        "In the above embodiments, the contents delivery system is explained as using an artificial satellite or satellite broadcasting system. However, the contents also can be delivered via any other broadcasting system using for example, usual earthy wave broadcast, CATV, internet broadcast etc.",
        "Although the present invention has been described based on preferred embodiments shown in the drawings, it is apparent that the present invention can be easily changed or modified by those skilled in the art. Such modifications are also included in the scope of the present invention."
