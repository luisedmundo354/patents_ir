        "With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to FIGS. 1 through 21 thereof, a new fluid dispensing system embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be described.",
        "As best illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 21, the fluid dispensing system 10 generally comprises a housing 12; a tank 14 for holding a vehicle fluid 2 such as windshield washing fluid, hydraulic brake fluid, antifreeze, soap solutions, or power steering fluid; a dispensing hose 16; and a control assembly 20. The dispensing system 10 is designed for permitting desired automatic dispensing of the vehicle fluid at a desired location of a fuel filling station. The vehicle solutions could also be any other known fluids typically used in association with automotive, farm or aviation vehicles.",
        "The tank 14 is positioned in the housing and has an interior space designed for holding the vehicle fluid 2. The housing 12 is structured to have an opening 18 in a forward face 19 of the housing 12.",
        "The dispensing hose 16 is part of a dispensing hose assembly 30 that is coupled to the tank 14. The dispensing hose 16 has a first end 14A in environmental communication with the interior space of the tank 14. Thus, the dispensing hose 16 is designed for dispensing the vehicle fluid 2 through the dispensing hose 16.",
        "A pump assembly 40 includes a pump 42 and is coupled to the dispensing hose 16 for pumping the vehicle fluid 2 through the dispensing hose 16. The pump assembly 40 includes a filter 44 positioned between the tank 14 and the pump 42 for removing debris from the vehicle fluid 2. Thus, the filter 44 removes debris from the vehicle fluid 2 before the vehicle fluid 2 enters the pump 42. In an embodiment, the pump assembly 40 also includes a flow meter 46 for monitoring flow of the vehicle fluid 2 through the pump assembly 40.",
        "The control assembly 20 is operationally coupled to the pump assembly 40 for selectively activating the pump 42. Thus, the pump 42 dispenses the vehicle fluid 2 only upon activation by the control assembly 20.",
        "A cover member 32 is couplable to the housing 12 for covering the opening 18 in the forward face 19 such that the control assembly 20 is covered to prevent unauthorized access to the control assembly 20. A currency collection assembly 50 is operationally coupled to the control assembly 20 such that the control assembly 20 dispenses the vehicle fluid only upon reception of a pre-determined initial value of currency collected by the currency collection assembly 50. Preferably, the currency collected can be in the form of either bills or coins.",
        "The currency collection assembly 50 includes a currency collection bin 52 coupled to the cover member 32. The currency collection bin 52 is positionable beneath a main portion 54 of the currency collection assembly 50 when the cover member 32 is engaged to the housing. Thus, currency passing through the main portion 54 of the currency collection assembly 50 is collected in the currency collection bin 52.",
        "In a most preferred embodiment, the control assembly 20 utilizes a computer controller 59 for crediting a pre-determined number of pulses upon accumulation of a pre-determined amount of currency. Each pulse is associated with a given amount of fluid such that a desired amount of fluid can be purchased by insertion of sufficient currency. As an additional feature, the computer controller 59 is operationally coupled to the currency collection assembly to prevent acceptance of currency when the level of fluid in the tank is below a pre-determined level, thus preventing acceptance of money in excess of an amount available to be dispensed.",
        "Alternately, the control assembly 20 may include an accumulating timer 56 for permitting dispensing of the vehicle fluid 2 for a pre-determined period of time upon reception of the initial value of currency collected by the currency collection assembly 50. In an embodiment, the currency collection assembly 50 is operationally coupled to the control assembly 20 such that the vehicle fluid 2 is dispensable for an additional pre-determined period of time upon reception of additional currency in excess of the initial value of currency collected by the currency collection assembly 50.",
        "The opening 18 in the housing 12 has a channel 62 extending along a bottom 64 of the opening 18 for receiving a bottom 66 of the cover member 32.",
        "In an embodiment, the cover member 32 includes a holster assembly 68 for receiving a free end of the dispensing hose 16. Typically, the free end of the dispensing hose 16 will have a pistol style attachment or other comparable nozzle with a trigger mechanism to permit a user to regulate flow of the vehicle fluid 2 through the dispensing hose 16.",
        "A holster switch 65 is operationally coupled to the control assembly 20 for preventing dispensing of the vehicle fluid 2 upon return of the free end of the dispensing hose 16 to the holster portion 68 after use. This may be by zeroing the credited pulses when the computer controller 59 is used or by zeroing an amount of time on the accumulating timer 56.",
