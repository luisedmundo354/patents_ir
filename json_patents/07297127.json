        "The invention relates generally to a head and cervical immobilization device. More particularly, the invention is a cervical immobilization device that can be erected from a flat condition to an operable condition to minimize movement of the head of an injured patient.",
        "2. Description of the Background Art",
        "It is essential to immobilize the head and cervical portions of patients or accident victims, who have suffered cervical injuries, to prevent further injury during their transport to a medical facility. Several varieties of head and cervical immobilization devices have been used in the emergency medical industry for many years. Some of these devices are designed to fold flat during storage and can be erected when needed.",
        "One type of head immobilization device includes a rigid structural portion that does not require the use of a rigid backboard to transport a patient safely. Examples of this type of device are disclosed generally in U.S. Pat. No. 4,034,748 to Winner, U.S. Pat. No. 4,211,218 to Kendrick, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,594,999 to Nesbit.",
        "Another type of head immobilization device is designed to be attached to a rigid backboard. Examples of this type of device are as follows.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,928,711 to Williams discloses a head immobilizer and method for immobilizing. The device of this patent includes flexible members that are bent independently to wrap around the sides of the head of a patient. The members are secured to a base for locking the position of the members. The head supporting members are attached to the base by a hook and loop fastening means.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,964,418 to Wilson discloses a collapsible cervical immobilization device. This device has a pair of collapsible members with fold lines to enable the members to conform to a patient's head. Rigid support members are then attached to a base by a hook and loop fastening means to restrain the patient's head and neck.",

Desirable embodiments of the reversible actuating device are used to fold and unfold at least one head-engaging arm.",
        "The reversible actuating device can be formed in a variety of shapes and from a variety of materials. Certain embodiments of the reversible actuating device place at least one head-engaging arm in an operable position. Other embodiments of the cervical actuating device place at least one head-engaging arm in an operable position and in a nonoperable position. Either embodiment of the reversible actuating device can be used with a lock. The lock can fix the head-engaging arms permanently or temporarily in one or both positions.",
        "The reversible actuating device can be made from more than one piece. For example the reversible actuating device can include at least two flexible members. Such an embodiment can use a separate flexible member to fold and/or unfold a separate arm or portion of an arm. The multiple pieces can be of the same or different materials.",
        "Embodiments of the reversible actuating device include string and cord. String and cord are flimsy and can be pulled by a user into an operable position to fold at least one arm. The string or cord is reversed or returned to its nonoperable position when a user flattens the arms into a storage position. The flattening of the arms pulls the string or cord back to its nonoperable position.",
        "Other embodiments of the reversible actuating device are made from rigid flat or cord-shaped materials including polymer materials, fibrous materials, leather, and metals. Rigid embodiments of the reversible actuating device can be used to fold and unfold at least one arm. For example, a metal wire can be used as a reversible actuating device such that when the wire is pulled at least one arm is folded, and when the wire is pushed at least one arm is returned to a flat or nonoperable position.",
        "Alternative embodiments of the reversible actuating device can be made of a plurality of parts and/or a plurality of materials. One example is the use of a stiff polymer or metal rod attached to flexible member such as a string or a cord. The rod can be rotated to wind the string or cord and fold the arms. Another example is a rack and pinion combination wherein the parts are made of stiff polymer, metal, or a combination thereof.",
        "The reversible actuating device of the preferred embodiment is desirably used with at least two head-engaging arms and moves these arms between a collapsed, generally flat position and an upright, head-engaging position to support both sides of the patient's head. This embodiment of the reversible actuating device can fold the arms in a substantially symmetrical manner to the upright position to reduce or eliminate twisting of the head and to support each side of the head uniformly. The reversible actuating device is desirably coupled to each of the head-engaging arms so as to fold each of the arms at the same time. This embodiment of the reversible actuating device applies a uniform pressure in opposite directions on each side of the head and prevents twisting of the neck or lateral movement of the head that might occur if the arms were folded one at a time. The reversible actuating device desirably locks the movable arms in the folded position for transport of the patient.",
        "The lock for the arms is optional and can include many embodiments. The lock can be permanent or temporary. The lock can be coupled to the arms in order to prevent their movement in relation to the base. The lock can include as an element or operate with the reversible actuating device. For example, a post and hole mechanism, a ratchet and pawl mechanism, a clamp, a screw mechanism, a button-like device, and/or an equivalent locking means can engage or operate with the reversible actuating device to lock the movement of at least one arm.",
        "The cervical immobilization device can be made from various materials having sufficient strength to support the head of a patient. Desirable embodiments are radiotransparent and can be made from a polymer material of varying grades, strengths, and thicknesses depending upon the intended use. Polymer materials can include sheet plastics, injection molded plastics, and/or thermoformed or rotation molded plastics. Durable polymers are desirable if the device is intended for multiple reuse and sterilization is required between uses. The illustrated and preferred embodiment of the device is made of a suitable cardboard material that is treated with a water repellant coating. A cardboard device has the benefit of being sufficiently inexpensive so as to render the device disposable if it becomes contaminated by body fluids or other matter. Alternative embodiments can be made from combinations of materials including sheet metal, canvass or other fabrics, polymers, and cardboard or other paper products.",
        "The cervical immobilization device is placed under the head of a patient with the center portion positioned directly below the patient's head. The center portion is desirably a panel or a padded material of a dimension to accommodate the head of a patient.",

        "An alternative embodiment of the cervical immobilization device (not shown) can use a rack and pinion and/or tooth and gear configuration to guide the two-directional movement of a reversible actuating device. Such a structure requires a rigid and resilient construction. Such a structure can be more expensive, but the movement of the parts is precise and smooth. Suitable locks or lock means can be use with these embodiments of the reversible actuating device.",
        "Several embodiments have been chosen to illustrate the invention. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various other modifications and embodiments can be constructed without departing from the various features of the invention. For example, the reversible actuating device in each of the illustrated embodiments is a flexible member that is pulled away from the device to pull the outer ends of the support arms of the device toward the patient's head to a locked position. In further embodiments, the reversible actuating device can be an assembly of flexible or rigid components or levers that can be either pushed or pulled to draw the arms from the flat position to the upright position for engaging the patient's head. In a further embodiment, the reversible actuating device can include a pair of rigid levers extending from the outer ends of the arms and coupled together by a pivot mechanism at the center of the device. An arm or lever can be attached to the pivot device that can be pulled or pushed causing a scissor-like action of the rigid members to pull the outer ends of the flaps toward the center of the device. In a similar manner, the locking device can be other arrangements for fixing the position of the arms in the folded position during use.",
        "The invention is a cervical immobilization device that collapses into a flat condition for storage and smoothly and folds into an operable condition wherein cervical immobilization members become upright and engage the sides of a patient's head. Desirable embodiments of the invention can be economically manufactured from inexpensive materials, rendering the device disposable if contaminated by a patient's body fluids. The device can be attached to a rigid backboard. Desirable embodiments of the invention have an reversible actuating device that enables head-engaging arms to engage simultaneously and symmetrically a patient's head when folded into an operating position so as to eliminate or reduce movement of the patient's head. The preferred reversible actuating device can be operated by the user with one hand to engage symmetrically both sides of the patient's head to prevent twisting of the head and to support the patient's head during transport."
