        "The present invention relates to urethane polymers and oligomers.",
        "Curable, or thermosettable, coating compositions are widely used in the coatings art, particularly for topcoats in the automotive and industrial coatings industry. Color-plus-clear composite coatings are particularly useful as topcoats for which exceptional gloss, depth of color, distinctness of image, or special metallic effects are desired. The automotive industry has made extensive use of these coatings for automotive body panels.",
        "Single-layer topcoats and the clearcoats of color-plus-clear composite coatings, however, require an extremely high degree of clarity and gloss to achieve the desired visual effect. Such coatings also require a low degree of visual aberrations at the surface of the coating in order to achieve the desired visual effect such as high distinctness of image (DOI). As such, these coatings are especially susceptible to a phenomenon known as environmental etch. Environmental etch manifests itself as spots or marks on or in the finish of the coating that often cannot be rubbed out. It is often difficult to predict the degree of resistance to environmental etch that a high gloss topcoat or color-plus-clear composite coating will exhibit. Many coating compositions known for their durability and/or weatherability when used in exterior paints, such as known high-solids enamels, do not provide the desired level of resistance to environmental etch when used in high gloss coatings such as the clearcoat of a color-plus-clear composite coating. Curable coating compositions based on curable components having carbamate or urea functionality have been proposed have been described in the art to provide etch-resistant coatings, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,356,669; 5,373,069; 5,854,385; and 6,245,855.",
        "Various compositions have been proposed to meet the above requirements for use as the topcoat coating or as the clearcoat of a color-plus-clear composite coating, including polyurethanes, acid-epoxy systems and the like. However, many prior art systems suffer from disadvantages such as coatability problems, marginal compatibility with the pigmented basecoat, solubility problems, and marginal appearance. Moreover, while one-pack compositions are preferred to two-pack compositions (in which the reactive component must be separated before application to prevent premature reaction), very few one-pack coating compositions have been found that provide satisfactory resistance to environmental etch, especially in the demanding environment of automotive coatings.",
        "In addition, it is desirable to provide coatings with a good combination of properties such as durability, hardness, flexibility, and resistance to scratching, marring, solvents, and acids. It is also desirable to reduce the amount of solvent required in coating compositions in order to reduce the volatile organic content (VOC), which is better for the environment. In addition to etch resistance, scratch and mar resistance is a desired property for a coating. Scratch and marring resistance is the ability of a coating to resist damage caused by abrasion of the coating.",
        "Curable coating compositions utilizing carbamate-functional resins are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,245,855; 6,160,058; 6,165,618; 6,144,444; 6,084,038; 6,080,825; 6,040,062; 5,994,479; 5,888,655; 5,872,195; 5,866,259; 5,854,385; 5,852,136; 5,827,930; 5,792,810; 5,777,048; 5,770,650; 5,766,769; 5,760,127; 5,756,213; 5,744,550; 5,726,274; 5,726,246; 5,726,244; 5,723,552; 5,693,724; 5,693,723; 5,659,003; 5,639,828; 5,532,061; 5,512,639; 5,508,379; 5,474,811; 5,451,656; 5,373,069; 5,356,669; 5,336,566; and 5,300,328 each of which is incorporated herein by reference, and U.S. application Ser.

As used herein, the term reaction material refers to the materials that react to form the reaction product.",
        "The present invention provides compositions that include an asymmetrical, saturated polyisocyanate that is non-cyclic, non-aromatic, and has at least 3 carbon atoms in the polyisocyanate per isocyanate group in their molecules. By poly it is meant that there are at least two isocyanate groups in the molecule. Preferably, the asymmetrical, saturated polyisocyanate is a diisocyanate. By non-cyclic and non-aromatic it is meant that no portion of the polyisocyanate is cyclic or aromatic. Preferably, the asymmetrical, saturated polyisocyanate is a non-crystalline aliphatic. Because of its commercial availability, a preferred asymmetrical, saturated polyisocyanate is trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate. Trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate (TMDI) generally has at least the following two isomers in commercially available product: 1,6-diisocyanto-2,2,4-trimethyl hexane and 1,6-diisocyanto-2,4,4-trimethyl hexane. As used throughout this specification, reference to trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate is to the commercial blend of isomers. Another preferred polyisocyanate is 1,8-diisocyanto-4(isocyantomethyl)octane. The polyisocyanate can also be provided as a dimer, trimer, homopolymer, or as a polyurethane prepolymer of the polyisocyanate.",
        "By asymmetrical it is meant that the polyisocyanate does not have symmetry in its structure. Symmetry is defined in the following applications, U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/211,577; 09/211,578; 09/211,579; and 09/211,598 all filed on Dec. 14, 1998, and all are incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, symmetry operations are geometrically defined ways of exchanging equivalent parts of a molecule. However, such operations are symmetry operations if, and only if, the appearance of the molecule is exactly the same relative to the pre- and post-symmetry operation view. Thus, the term \u201csymmetrical\u201d as used herein refers to a molecule having an appearance that appears identical relative to the pre- and post-symmetry operation views. Put another way, \u201c[a]molecule possesses a symmetry element if the application of the operation generated by the element leaves the molecule in an indistinguishable state.\u201d Molecular Symmetry and Group Theory, Alan Vincent, Wiley & Sons, N.Y., 1977, reprinted 1981, page 21, incorporated herein by reference.",
        "Additionally, when there are less than 3 carbon atoms in the polyisocyanate per isocyanate group, products that contain these polyisocyariates are generally more crystalline. Note, when counting the carbon atoms in a polyisocyanate, the carbon atom that is in the isocyanate group is part of the isocyanate group and is not counted as a carbon in the polyisocyanate.",
        "Without being limited to theory, it is theorized that polyisocyanates that have freedom of motion in their backbones increase the flexibility of products that contain them. Generally, polyisocyanates that contain cyclics, aromatics, or are ethylenically unsaturated, such as alkenes or alkynes, do not provide freedom of movement that is preferred to obtain maximum levels of flexibility.",
        "The primary carbamate material can be any primary carbamate material that has at least one functional group that is reactive with an isocyanate and at least one primary carbamate group or a group that is convertible to a primary carbamate group. The functional group that is reactive with an isocyanate group includes, but is not limited to, a hydroxyl group, an amine group, and a thiol group. A preferred functional group is a hydroxyl group. A preferred primary carbamate material has a primary carbamate group and a hydroxy group, which is separated from the primary carbamate group by at least two carbon atoms. A preferred primary carbamate material of this type is a hydroxyalkyl carbamate. A preferred hydroxyalkyl carbamate is represented by the following structure:",
        "wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, and R6 are each independently H or C1-C6 alkyl, and n is 0 or a positive integer. Preferably, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, and R6 are each independently H or C1-C4alkyl. Examples of primary carbamate materials include, but are not limited to, hydroxy ethyl carbamate, hydroxy propyl carbamate, and hydroxy butyl carbamate. A preferred hydroxyalkyl carbamate is hydroxypropyl carbamate, which is at least one of 2-hydroxy propyl-1-carbamate, 1-hydroxy propyl-2-carbamate, and 3-hydroxypropyl carbamate. Hydroxy butyl carbamate includes, but is not limited to, 1-hydroxy butyl-2-carbamate, 2-hydroxy butyl carbamate, and 4-hydroxybutyl carbamate.",
        "The group convertible or capable of converting to a primary carbamate group can form a primary carbamate after the reaction of the primary carbamate material with the asymmetrical, saturated polyisocyanate is completed. These types of primary carbamate materials include, but are not limited to, hydroxy-containing cyclic carbonate compounds, such as glycerine carbonate, which are convertible to primary carbamate by reaction with ammonia (e.g., the reaction product of glycidol and CO2), monoglycidyl ethers (e.g., glycidyl propyl ether convertible to primary carbamate by reaction with CO2 and then ammonia), allyl alcohols where the alcohol group is reactive with NCO and the double bond can be converted to primary carbamate by reaction with peroxide, and vinyl esters where the ester group is reactive with NCO and the vinyl group can be converted to primary carbamate with reaction with peroxide, then CO2, and then ammonia. Also suitable as the primary carbamate material are compounds having a primary carbamate group as well as a group that can be converted into a primary carbamate. The primary carbamate group can then react with the isocyanate group to form an allophanate. The primary carbamate-convertible group can then be converted into a primary carbamate. An example of such a compound is allyl carbamate. In another example, the isocyanate can be reacted with a diol or amino alcohol to form a urethane or urea compound with terminal or pendant hydroxy groups. The terminal or pendant hydroxy groups can then be transformed into primary carbamate groups using known techniques, such as the reaction with phosgene then ammonia, or by transcarbamation with an alkyl or ether carbamate.",
        "Preferably, the primary carbamate material is asymmetrical and/or a mixture of isomers.
