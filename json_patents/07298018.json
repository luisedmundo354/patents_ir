        "The present invention relates to ferroelectric structures useful in fabricating capacitors wherein a ferroelectric film separates a Lead Zirconate Titanate film from an associated electrode.",
        "Ferroelectric thin films of Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 (lead zirconate titanate or \u201cPZT\u201d) are being developed for next generation electronic devices such as non-volatile and optical memories, micro switches, micro-actuators, micro-positioners, micro sensors, energy generators, etc. The progress made in fabricating high quality PZT films has opened a new area for applications in biomedical devices, especially the possible integration of high quality PZT films with silicon technology. The growth of PZT thin films has been realized by various methods; a method known as the \u201csol-gel\u201d method is likely to be a dominant growth technique because the sol-gel method is a simple process that meets device fabrication requirements, such as relatively low processing temperature, large area coating ability and ease of composition control (see R. W. Schwartz, J. A. Voigt, B. A. Tuttle, D. A. Payne, T. L. Reichert and R. S. DaSalla, \u201cComments on the effects of solution precursor characteristics and thermal processing conditions on the crystallization behavior of sol-gel derived PZT thin films,\u201d J. Mater. Res., Vol. 12, no. 2, February 1997, pp. 444).",
        "When promoting the fabrication of a PZT film on a silicon (Si) substrate, which involves coating with a precursor solution and subsequent annealing, it is known to be important to control the formation of a desirable phase in the PZT film, called the \u201cperovskite phase\u201d. It is known that the diffusion of lead (Pb) from the PZT film to the substrate occurs during the annealing of the PZT and can easily induce the formation of an undesirable phase in the PZT film, called the \u201cpyrochlore phase\u201d, at the PZT film/substrate interface (see R. A. Roy, K. F. Etzold, \u201cSubstrate and temperature effects in lead zirconate titanate films produced by facing targets sputtering,\u201d J. Mater. Res. Vol. 7, no. 6, June 1992, pp. 1455).",
        "High temperature processing can also cause lead volatilization, which has been shown to result in the formation of undesirable PZT phase and microstructure. For instance, conventional 2-methoxyethanol derived PZT film without any seeding layer has been shown to result in a \u201crosette\u201d microstructure with micron size non-uniform grains (see J. Lee, C. Kim, D. Yoon, C. Choi, J. Kim, K. No, Jpn. J. Appi. Phys. 33 (1994) 260 and C. Kwok, S. B. Desu, \u201cLow temperature perovskite formation of lead zirconate titanate thin films by a seeding process,\u201d J. Mater. Res., vol. 8, no. 2, February 1993, 339). The undesirable PZT phase and microstructure have been shown to degrade the electrical properties of the PZT film (see K. Sreenivas, I. Reaney, T. Maeder and N. Setter, \u201cInvestigation of Pt/Ti bilayer metallization on silicon for ferroelectric thin film integration,\u201d J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 75 (1994), 232-239).",
        "The challenge of integrating PZT films with a silicon substrate is primarily the development of a PZT fabrication process compatible with the silicon without significant formation of the undesirable phase.",
        "More recently, studies have been performed to reduce the processing temperature and improve the ferroelectric properties of the films fabricated using the sol-gel method. Kwok and Desu presented a novel PZT deposition method to include a lead titanate (PbTiO3 or \u201cPT\u201d) seeding layer between the PZT film and a substrate. This seeding layer can offer nucleation sites (i.e., locations where the conditions for the formation of crystals, is favorable) and reduce the activation energy for crystallization of PZT thin films, thereby lowering the perovskite formation temperature (see C. Kwok, S. B. Desu, \u201cLow temperature perovskite formation of lead zirconate titanate thin films by a seeding process,\u201d J. Mater. Res., vol. 8, no. 2, February 1993, 339). The perovskite formation temperature of PZT alone is known to be about 900\u00b0 C., while the perovskite transformation temperature of a PZT/PT structure is only 750\u00b0 C. (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,507,060 to Ren et al.). Ren et al. have also demonstrated that PT/PZT/PT structures can be formed at a much lower processing temperature of around 600-700\u00b0 C. (see T. L. Ren, L. T. Zhang, L. T. Liu and Z. J. Li, \u201cElectrical properties of a silicon-based PT/PZT/PT sandwich structure,\u201d J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys., Volume 33, Number 15, 7 August 2000, L77).",
        "The use of conductive oxide electrodes that can easily adhere to SiO2/Si substrates without the need for additional adhesion layers can also be shown to provide excellent resistance to polarization fatigue (Y. K. Wang, T. Y. Tseng and P. Lin, \u201cEnhanced ferroelectric properties of Pb(Zr0.53Ti0.47)O3 thin films on SrRuO3/Ru/SiO2/Si substrates,\u201d Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 80, Issue 20, pp. 3790, May 20, 2002). However, the results reveal that the conductive oxide electrodes lead to a large increase in leakage current and an increased susceptibility to early dielectric breakdown when compared with the use of platinum electrodes. Kim et al. reported the effects of a PT layer on Pt/RuO2 hybrid electrodes and showed control of the second phase (Pb2Ru2O7-x) with improved ferroelectric properties (S. H. Kim, Y. S. Choi, C. E. Kim, D. Y. Yang, \u201cThe effects of PbTiO3 thin template layer and Pt/RuO2 hybrid electrode on the ferroelectric properties of sol-gel derived PZT thin film,\u201d Thin Solid Films, vol. 325, issue 1, pp. 72-78, 18 July 1998).",
        "While some gains have been made, further reductions in the processing temperature and further improvements in the ferroelectric properties of PZT film structures may be seen as beneficial.",
        "A Lanthanum doped Lead Titanate (PLT) layer may be used as a seeding layer between a Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) layer and an associated electrode. As such, a silicon-based PLT/PZT/PLT sandwich structure may be fabricated, whose thermal budget and cost of fabrication are substantially reduced and the ferroelectric properties are improved relative to known PZT sandwich structures. Advantageously, relative to the known PZT sandwich structures, processing temperatures are reduced, density of oxygen vacancies in the PZT layer is reduced and polarization fatigue properties are improved.",

When fabricating the first phase substrate 100, a dielectric layer 104 is formed over the semiconductor substrate 102. The dielectric layer 104 may be made of silicon dioxide material formed by performing a conventional deposition technique such as a thermal oxidation. The thickness of the dielectric layer 104 may be within a range of about 0.1-2.0 \u03bcm (layers are not illustrated to scale).",
        "The substrate 102 may be considered to function mainly as a support, without a role to play in the electrical properties of the eventually formed ferroelectric structure. However, the surface conditions (roughness) of the substrate 102 may be considered very important to the adhesion of the dielectric layer 104 and the successive conductive films.",
        "Additionally, the substrate 102 should be selected to withstand the processing temperatures necessary to the correct formation (nucleation and growth) of the ferroelectric structure. The correctness of the nucleation and growth ferroelectric structure may be considered to depend primarily on the surface nature of the conductive film on which the ferroelectric structure is formed. As such, the electrical properties of the ferroelectric structure may be shown to be dependent on the surface morphology of the conductive films. While a semiconductor, such as silicon (Si), may be selected for the substrate 102, a polycrystalline or single crystal ceramic may also be selected for the substrate 102. Eligible ceramics include glass, quartz, SrTiO3, Al2O3, MgO, RuO2 and SrRuO3.",

Excess lead may be added to the precursor solution by adding an appropriate wt % of a lead source (e.g., lead acetate trihydrate). Although the addition of 5 to 20 mol % excess lead has been found beneficial, it has been found that the addition of 20 mol % excess lead is optimal. Notably, ferroelectric parameters start decreasing with the appearance of minor secondary phases (Pb-rich) as the excess lead content is increased above 20 mol %.",
        "The excess lead acts to compensate for a loss of lead due to volatilization during the annealing. The annealed PZT layer may have a stoichiometric composition of Pb/(Zr+Ti) around 1.00 with the Zr/Ti ratio of about 52/48. Such a stoichiometric composition may be considered close to a morphotropic PZT composition, which separates into a tetragonal (rich in titanium) perovskite phase and a rhombohedral (rich in zirconium) perovskite phase. This stoichiometric composition is widely used and studied because the composition exhibits optimal dielectric and ferroelectric properties for several applications (see C. A. Paz de Araujo, J. D.

More than one layer of PZT may be deposited to prepare an overall thicker PZT layer 412 than would normally be deposited in a single spin coating. Three or four 50 nm thick layers may be deposited to give a 150-200 nm thick layer that is then annealed at 700\u00b0 C. for one hour in a furnace at a heating rate of 10\u00b0 C. per minute and then allowed to cool to room temperature inside the furnace. Consequently, to form a 1 \u03bcm thick PLT/PZT/PLT ferroelectric capacitor 400, a 900 nm thick PZT layer 412 may formed of 18 layers that are each 50 nm thick.",

The improvement may be attributed to the bottom PLT layer 410A, which may be considered to offer nucleation sites and reduce the activation energy for the crystallization of the PZT layer 412 forming stoichiometric perovskite structures at processing temperatures around 700\u00b0 C. In addition, the PLT layers 410A, 410B may be seen to help to attain a better interface between the PZT layer 412 and the associated electrodes 308, 514, thereby leading to absorption of oxygen vacancies or other point defects from the PZT layer 412.",

A fourth XRD pattern 720D relates to a 1 \u03bcm thick PLT/PZT ferroelectric capacitor formed using a PZT precursor solution having 20 mol % excess lead.",
        "The sharp diffraction peaks indicate better homogeneity and crystallization of the films. All the films exhibited perovskite structures with random orientations and dominant peaks at 702 and 704. A small amount of pyrochlore phase was observed, as indicated by the presence of a pyrochlore peak 703 in the first XRD pattern 720A, but the pyrochlore peak 703 becomes weaker as the PZT layer 412 thickness is increased. The quantity of pyrochlore phase is negligibly small (less than 1%) and, hence, the films can be considered as single phase. It can be shown that the presence of the pyrochlore phase can be effectively eliminated by either annealing at a higher temperature (greater than 750\u00b0 C.) or by increasing the amount of excess lead in the PZT precursor solution to about 20 mol % and annealing at 700\u00b0 C. for one hour (see the fourth XRD pattern 720D).",
        "In operation, an electric field may be applied to a PLT/PZT/PLT ferroelectric capacitor so that the PLT/PZT/PLT ferroelectric capacitor reaches a saturation polarization. The electric field may then be removed. As a consequence of the application of electric field, the PLT/PZT/PLT ferroelectric capacitor maintains a remnant polarization, that is, the PLT/PZT/PLT ferroelectric capacitor maintains a charge. Thus, the PLT/PZT/PLT ferroelectric capacitor may be used as an element of a memory. Advantageously, the maintenance of the charge does not require electrical power. The charge maintained on the PLT/PZT/PLT ferroelectric capacitor may be reversed through the application of an electric field of equal magnitude and opposite orientation. The maintenance of charge for a given ferroelectric device may be studied through a measurement of a ferroelectric hysteresis loop.",

A second hysteresis loop 804 is illustrated for a 250 nm thick PT/PZT/PT ferroelectric capacitor and a third hysteresis loop 806 is illustrated for a 250 nm thick PZT-only ferroelectric capacitor. In comparison to the second hysteresis loop 804 and the third hysteresis loop 806, the first hysteresis loop 802 illustrates that a PLT/PZT/PLT ferroelectric capacitor demonstrates better ferroelectric characteristics than a similarly dimensioned PT/PZT/PT ferroelectric capacitor or PZT-only ferroelectric capacitor.",

Notably, the second hysteresis loop 904 and third hysteresis loop 906 display ferroelectric characteristics corresponding to 1 \u03bcm thick PT/PZT/PT and PZT-only ferroelectric capacitors that are better than the ferroelectric characteristics corresponding to 250 \u03bcm thick PT/PZT/PT and PZT-only ferroelectric capacitors (in the second hysteresis loop 804 and the third hysteresis loop 806 of FIG. 8). However, the second hysteresis loop 904 and third hysteresis loop 906 are associated with Pr (30 and 45 \u03bcC/cm2, respectively) and Pmax (40 and 60 \u03bcC/cm2, respectively) values that are lower than the Pr (50 \u03bcC/cm2) and Pmax (85 \u03bcC/cm2) values for the first hysteresis loop 902 and an Ec (around 275 kV/cm) value that is higher than the Ec value (225 kV/cm) for the first hysteresis loop 902.

        "It is also worth noting that the PLT/PZT/PLT ferroelectric capacitor exhibits symmetric hysteresis loops when the capacitor thickness is around 250 nm (represented by the first hysteresis loop 802 in FIG. 8) and maintains the symmetry at higher thicknesses, around 1 \u03bcm (represented by the first hysteresis loop 902 in FIG. 9). This indicates that thicker PLT/PZT/PLT ferroelectric capacitors show improved polarization, in comparison to PT/PLT/PT and PZT-only ferroelectric capacitors, when the applied electric field is strong enough to switch the domains along the field direction, i.e., it may be considered that thicker capacitors behave like bulk ferroelectrics.",
        "The ferroelectric hysteresis behavior of the PLT/PZT/PLT ferroelectric capacitor formed according to an embodiment of the present invention with a thickness around 250 nm may also be considered in light of a Capacitance-Voltage (C-V) characteristic 1000, which is illustrated in FIG. 10. The C-V characteristic 1000 may be recorded as an applied voltage is swept from a positive to negative bias and back again at 100 kHz. Two peaks (1002, 1004) are clearly seen in FIG. 10 as the capacitance of the PLT/PZT/PLT ferroelectric capacitor ranges from 0.9 nF to 1.3 nF responsive to an applied bias that ranges from \u22125 V to +5 V. The presence of two peaks is generally attributed to the ferroelectric domain switching (S. B. Desu and D. P. Vijay, Mater. Sci. Eng., B 32, vol. 75, 1995). The two peaks 1002, 1004 are not perfectly symmetric, although the peak capacitance and the corresponding voltages are nearly equal. The reason for these differences may be the nature of the interfaces in the sandwich structure (see T. L. Ren, L. T. Zhang, L. T. Liu and Z. J. Li, \u201cElectrical properties of a silicon-based PT/PZT/PT sandwich structure,\u201d J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys., Volume 33, Number 15, 7 August 2000, L77).",
        "A curve 1102 characterizing a loss of switchable polarization with repeated polarization reversals known as ferroelectric fatigue is shown for the PLT/PZT/PLT film in FIG. 11. For comparison, fatigue characteristic curves of PLT/PZT 1103, PT/PZT/PT 1104 and PZT-only 1106 ferroelectric capacitors are also illustrated. All four curves 1102, 1103, 1104, 1106 exhibit similar fatigue properties up to 106 cycles, however the fatigue characteristic curve 1106 for the PZT-only ferroelectric capacitor shows an abrupt polarization decrease between 107 to 1010 cycles. It may be shown that a PZT-only ferroelectric capacitor may have approximately 17% of polarization loss at 1010 cycles. In comparison, the PLT/PZT, PT/PZT/PT and PLT/PZT/PLT multilayer structures show better fatigue characteristics in terms of reduced loss of switchable polarization. At 1010 cycles, polarization loss of about 9% is observed in the PLT/PZT/PLT structures (curve 1102) whereas PT/PZT/PT display a 12% loss (curve 1104).",
        "FIG. 12 depicts the leakage current density (J) versus electric field (E) characteristics for PLT/PZT/PLT (1202), PT/PZT/PT (1204) and PZT-only (1206) ferroelectric capacitors. Each of the three J-E characteristics 1202, 1204, 1206 demonstrate three distinct regimes of leakage current transport. At very low electric fields, i.e., below 15 kV/cm, the current density increases almost linearly with voltage, i.e., the films display nearly Ohmic behavior. This leakage current is likely to be due to a hopping conduction mechanism in a low electric field, because thermal excitation of trapped electrons from one trap site to another dominates transport in the films",
        "S. Ezhilvalavan and T. Y. Tseng, \u201cConduction mechanisms in amorphous and crystalline Ta2O5 thin films,\u201d J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 83, issue 9, pp. 4797, May 1, 1998 and S. Ezhilvalavan, Victor Samper, T. W. Seng, J. M. Xue, J. Wang, J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 96, issue 4, pp. 2181, Aug. 15, 2004. At intermediate electric fields, i.e., 50 to 350 kV/cm, the current density increases proportionally to the square root of the applied electric field. At higher electric fields, i.e., greater than 350 kV/cm, the current density increases rapidly for a slight increase in the applied electric field, which suggests that the leakage current density is limited by a different conduction mechanism from that in the low electric field regime.",
        "The PLT/PZT/PLT (1202) and PT/PZT/PT (1204) J-E characteristics each exhibit a leakage current density of around 3.5\u00d710\u22128 A/cm2 at 200 kV/cm, whereas the PZT-only J-E characteristic exhibits a leakage current density of around 10\u22127 A/cm2 for the same electric field. At higher electric fields, say greater than 400 kV/cm, the PLT/PZT/PLT J-E characteristic 1202 has a much lower leakage current density value than the values for either the PT/PZT/PT J-E characteristic 1204 or the PZT-only J-E characteristics 1206, indicating that the PLT/PZT/PLT structure has better electrical stability than the PT/PZT/PT and PZT-only ferroelectric capacitor. The improved J-E characteristics of the PLT/PZT/PLT structure could be attributed to the formation of a Pt/PLT interface between the second conductive film 308 and the bottom PLT layer 410A and a Pt/PLT interface between the top PLT layer 410B and the third conductive film 514. The Pt/PLT interface may be seen to help to lower the densities of oxygen vacancies typically formed at Pt/PZT interfaces, responsible for increasing the leakage current in PZT-only ferroelectric capacitor. These oxygen vacancies are generally believed to be responsible for the fatigue behavior in PZT grown on Pt (P. K. Larsen, G. J. M. Dormans, D. J. Taylor and P.

A plot 1302 of the dielectric constant decreases steadily from around 735 to around 450 with increasing frequency from 100 Hz to 100 kHz. A plot 1304 of the loss tangent varies from 0.04 to 0.06 in the same frequency range.",
        "The plots 1302, 1304 demonstrate that, by introducing PLT layers 410A, 410B, which have a lower dielectric constant than the PZT layer 412, above and below the PZT layer 412, the electrical properties of resulting structure can be superior to a PT/PZT/PT ferroelectric capacitor or a PZT-only ferroelectric capacitor. The electrical properties, such as the coercive field and leakage current density, can be substantially reduced with better resistance to fatigue and the remnant polarization can be increased. These benefits may be attributed to the effect of the PLT layer, which can offer nucleation sites and reduce the activation energy for the crystallization of PZT layers forming stoichiometric perovskite structure at lower processing temperature (around 700\u00b0 C.). In addition, the PLT layer 410 helps to attain a better interface between the PZT layer 412 and the associated electrodes 308, 514, thereby leading to absorption of oxygen vacancies or other point defects from the PZT layer 412 (O. Auciello, J. F. Scott and R. Ramesh, \u201cThe Physics of Ferroelectric Memories,\u201d Phys. Today, vol. 51, no. 22, July 1998 and F. Yan, Y. Wang, H. L. W. Chan and C. L.

Francis, \u201cProcessing and characterization of piezoelectric materials and integration into microelectromechanical systems,\u201d Annu. Rev. Mater. Sci., Vol. 28 (1998), pp. 563). For comparison, Ren et al. reported that a coercive field of 24 kV/cm, a leakage current density of 5\u00d710\u22129 A/cm2 and a remnant polarization of 17 \u03bcC/cm2 for PT/PZT/PT structures, with thickness of the layers 20/200-500/20 nm. However, Ren et al. have not studied the ferroelectric characteristics of the thick (greater than 500 nm) PT/PZT/PT structures. Therefore present studies envisage that both thin (around 250 nm) and thick (around 1 \u03bcm) ferroelectric capacitors with the PLT/PZT/PLT sandwich structure will exhibit better ferroelectric and leakage current characteristics in comparison to PT/PZT/PT sandwich structures and exhibit more reliable fatigue characteristics.",

Wet chemical etching is an alternative approach for patterning thick (i.e., greater than 1 \u03bcm) PZT films for micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS). The etching rate of such a solvent solution may be determined to be about 200 nm/min. Photo resist coatings may be used to mask circular PZT patterns of diameter 2 mm.",
