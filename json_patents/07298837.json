        "Several types of wire based communication networks exist to provide communication among electronic devices. Many of these networks transmit a differential representation of the data over the network. A differential network uses a transmission cable that has a positive and a negative conductor, and positive and inverted representations of the data are sent on the conductors. A differential signal has the advantage of allowing faster data rates because the differential signals traverse lower voltage swings than single ended signals. Also, the data is less susceptible to noise in a differential signal bus because common mode signal noise picked up on the transmission cable is cancelled by sensing only the difference between the positive and negative conductors of the cable.",
        "One critical parameter in differential signal wire based networks is the differential cross-over voltage of the signal transmitters. The differential cross-over voltage is the point where the voltage at the output of the positive signal transmitter crosses over with the voltage at the output of the negative signal transmitter. To minimize communication errors from power supply noise, electromagnetic interference (EMI), or signal ringing, the cross-over voltage should be at a point equidistant between the maximum and minimum voltages of the outputs. This point is often referred to as mid-rail.",
        "If the network is a wire based serial network, transceivers are used to transmit and receive signals on the same transmission cable. Transmitters of wire based analog transceivers are generally designed with open-loop differential drivers. The drivers are open-loop in that they do not include a feedback mechanism in controlling their output. These transmitters are designed by tuning the cross-over voltage to an optimal mid-rail assuming a nominal process skew and nominal loading on the transmitter outputs. A problem with tuning is that when the transmitter is realized in silicon the cross-over voltage can deviate from the optimal mid-rail value due to undesired process variations or due to asymmetric parasitic off-chip loading. A deviation in the cross-over voltage from the mid-rail voltage value can result in low yield in semiconductor fabrication of the transmitters. A mask iteration may be needed to take into account the non-nominal conditions and to re-tune the cross-over voltage to the mid-rail value.",

        "This document describes a feedback circuit for use with a differential transceiver that locks the cross-over voltage substantially to a point equidistant between the maximum and minimum voltage of the output of the transceiver transmitter. This equidistant point is often referred to as the mid-rail point.",
        "FIG. 1 is a drawing of an embodiment of a serial bus transceiver 100 with a cross-over lock feedback circuit 110. The transceiver 100 allows a processor to communicate with other devices connected on the serial bus. The transceiver 100 includes a receiver 120 for receiving signals from a transmission cable 130 comprising a positive conductor 132 (D+) and a negative conductor 134 (D\u2212). The receiver 120 comprises a differential receiver 122, a single ended receiver 124 for the positive conductor 132 (D+) and a single ended receiver 126 for the negative conductor 134 (D\u2212). The single ended receivers 124, 126 detect rail-to-rail transitions on the D+, D\u2212 conductors 132, 134 and trip when a voltage threshold on the differential inputs is exceeded. The single-ended receivers 124, 126 are used to detect events such as idle mode or wake-up on the serial bus, and to determine a data transfer rate. The differential receiver 122 detects the incoming data stream and the output trips at the cross-over voltage of the D+, D\u2212 conductors 132, 134.",
        "The transceiver 100 also includes a transmitter 140 for transmitting signals on the transmission cable 130. The transmitter 140 comprises a single ended output driver 142 for the positive conductor 132 and a single ended driver 144 for the negative conductor 134. If the transceiver 100 is implemented in CMOS, output drivers 142, 144 are typically designed with PMOS pull-ups and NMOS pull-downs that have equal strength at nominal conditions.",
        "FIG. 2A is a graph 210 showing an output transition of a transceiver 100 with a weak pull-up circuit. In the embodiment shown, the signals transition between a low rail of zero volts and a high rail of three volts. Other values for low and high rails are within contemplation of this application. The D+ conductor 132 is shown transitioning from the high rail to the low rail, and the D\u2212 134 conductor is transitioning from the low rail to the high rail. Because of the mismatch in pull-up rise time and pull-down fall time, a high-to-low signal transition 212 occurs more quickly than a low-to-high signal transition 214. The result is a cross-over voltage point 216 at about one volt instead of the mid-rail 1.5 volts. The differential receiver 122 has high gain and trips at the cross-over point. Because the cross-over point is low, the transceiver is more susceptible to noise on the low rail conductor than if the cross-over point was mid-rail.",
        "FIG. 2B is a graph 220 showing asymmetry in the transitions of receiver outputs 222, 224, 226 due to the weak pull-up circuit. In the embodiment, the output of the differential receiver 222 (RXD) follows the positive logic of the output of the positive single ended receiver 224 (RXDP) which follows the transition of the D+ conductor 132. The output of the negative single ended receiver 226 (RXDM) follows the D\u2212 conductor 132. The graph 220 shows the output of the differential receiver 222 (RXD) trips before the output of the negative receiver 226 (RXDM). In the ideal case of a mid-rail cross-over point, the single ended receiver 224, 226 transition points would be coincident or symmetric about the differential receiver 222 output transition point. For the opposite case when the D+ conductor is transitioning from low to high, the output of the positive receiver 224 (RXDP) lags the output of the differential receiver 222 (RXD).",
        "FIG. 3A is a graph 310 showing an output transition of a transceiver 100 with a weak pull-down circuit. As in FIG. 2A, the D+ conductor 132 is shown transitioning from the high rail to the low rail, and the D\u2212 conductor 134 is transitioning from the low rail to the high rail. This time, the mismatch in rise and fall times causes a cross-over voltage point 316 at about two volts instead of the mid-rail 1.5 volts. Because the cross-over point is high, the transceiver is more susceptible to noise on the high rail conductor. FIG. 3B is a graph 320 showing asymmetry in the transitions of receiver outputs 322, 324, 326 due to the weak pull-down circuit. The graph 320 shows the output of the differential receiver 322 (RXD) trips before the output of the positive receiver 324 (RXDP).

        "To correct the mismatches in rise and fall times, the cross-over feedback lock circuit 110 creates a bias voltage to correct the strength of the pull-down and/or pull-up circuits in the transmitter single ended output drivers 142, 144. An embodiment of a single ended output driver 400 is shown in FIG. 4. Changing the voltage on the gate of PMOS transistor 410 changes the current drive strength of the pull-up bias circuit of the output driver 400. For example, if the voltage of the gate is decreased, the drive strength of the PMOS transistor 410 is increased, and the pull-up is biased toward the high rail (VCC). Conversely, if the gate voltage is increased, the drive strength of the PMOS transistor 410 is decreased, and the pull-up is biased away from the high rail.",
        "Changing the voltage on the gate of NMOS transistor 420 changes the bias of the pull-down of the output driver 400. For example, if the voltage of the gate is increased, the drive strength of the NMOS transistor 420 is increased, and the pull-down is biased toward the low rail (VSS). Conversely, if the gate voltage is decreased, the drive strength of the NMOS transistor 420 is decreased, and the pull-down is biased away from the low rail. Thus, a closed loop system is created by feeding back a voltage to the gates that adjusts the pull-up and/or pull-down biasing by an amount that corrects the mismatch in drive strength.",
        "To create the correcting voltage, a charge is produced based on the output switching time of the differential receiver 122 in relation to the output switching time of the single ended receivers 124, 126. If the cross-over voltage is at mid-rail, the switching is symmetric and no net charge is produced. If the cross-over voltage is not at mid-rail the deviation of the cross-over voltage from a predetermined level results in switching that is asymmetric, and the asymmetry produces a net charge that is converted into a correcting bias voltage for the output drivers 142, 144.",

The switching to enable the current is a function of the states of the outputs of the differential receiver (RXD) 530 and the D+ single ended receiver (RXDP) 535.
