        "Electronic industries continue to seek products, such as mobile phones and PDAs that are lighter, faster, smaller, multi-functional, more reliable and more cost-effective. In order to meet the requirement of the electronic industries, semiconductor devices have become increasingly integrated. A representative semiconductor package using solder balls (instead of connecting pins) is a BGA package and a representative packaging process adopted in integrated semiconductor packages is a chip scale package (CSP).",
        "Demand for more compact semiconductor devices with larger capacity has resulted in the development of stacked BGA packages. In general, a stacked BGA package have been adopted because of the possibility of increasing the memory capacity of a semiconductor package by two or more times, as a result of stacking two or more packages.",
        "FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a conventional stacked BGA package using a flexible printed circuit board 20.

The first and second packages 10 and 30 may include package bodies 12 and 32 with a semiconductor chip (not shown) and solder balls 14 and 34 exposed outside of the package bodies 12 and 32, respectively.

        "As described above, the conventional stacked BGA package has advantages, for example, decreasing the package size and/or increasing the capacity of a unit package, by forming the solder balls 14 and 34 on the bottom of the chips. However, the conventional stacked BGA package using the flexible printed circuit board 20 may extend the electrical connecting length between the first and second package 10 and 30. In this case, the flexible printed circuit board 20 should be used to manufacturing the stacked BGA package.",

An active surface of the second semiconductor chip 105 may be sealed with an upper BGA package. However, the active surface of the second semiconductor chip 105, i.e., the upper chip, in the other BGA packages 100b, 100c and 100d may be exposed to be connected to another adjacent BGA package. Also, the conductive circuit layer 120 may be formed on the exposed active surface of the second semiconductor chip 105.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 4, the conductive circuit layer 120 may include a series of solder ball landing pads 121 and a series of conductive patterns 123, connected to corresponding the series of bonding pads 105a on the second semiconductor chip 105. The solder ball landing pads 121 and the conductive pattern 123 may be separated from adjacent solder ball landing pad 121 and/or conductive pattern 123 by an electrical insulator.",
        "Referring to FIG. 5a, the conductive circuit layer 120 may be a tape, in which the solder ball landing pad 121 and the conductive pattern 123 are formed. In detail, the conductive pattern 123 may be extended to contact to the bonding pad 105a. The solder ball 116 may be attached on the solder ball landing pad 121, and may be electrically connected to the bonding pad 105a by the conductive pattern 123.",
        "With reference to FIG. 5b, the conductive circuit layer 120 may be directly formed on the semiconductor chip. In a manufacturing process for semiconductor devices, i.e., forming the bonding pad 105a by a metal, the conductive circuit layer 120 may be formed with a formation of the bonding pad 105a, thereby patterning the solder ball landing pad 121 and the conductive pattern 123, simultaneously. In such an exemplary method, the conductive circuit layer 120 may be formed without an additional taping process and photolithography process.",

The holes 133 in the printed circuit board 101 may enable connection to the wire bonding pads 109, therefore a conductive material (not shown) may be plated and/or inserted inside the holes 133. The conductive patterns 135 may connect to the holes 133 and the solder ball landing pads 130. Each conductive pattern 125 may be separated from adjacent conductive patterns 135. The solder ball landing pads 130 which are placed on the underside of the printed circuit board 101 may be connected to the corresponding solder ball landing pads 121 on the conductive circuit layer 120 of the adjacent BGA package (not shown).",

The solder balls 115 of the base BGA package 100a need not be encapsulated, thereby enabling mounting to a main board (not shown). However, the solder balls 116 of the upper BGA packages 100b, 100c and 100d may be encapsulated to disperse any stress concentrated at the solder joint, to further protect the conductive circuit layer 120 and improve the package reliability. Thus, the BGA packages 100a through 100d may be electrically connected by the solder balls 115 and 116.",

Furthermore, the second semiconductor chip 105 may be essentially the same as the first semiconductor chip 103. The bonding wires 111b may then be electrically connected to the corresponding bonding pads 105a of the second semiconductor chip 105 and the wire bonding pads 109 on the printed circuit board 101.",

The encapsulation 113 may expose a portion of the active surface of the second semiconductor chip 105, to stack other BGA packages 100b through 100d. In addition, the solder balls 115 may have an input/output function of the first and second semiconductor chips 103 and 105 may be soldered on the solder ball landing pads 130 of the printed circuit board 101, and thus the unit BGA package 100 may be completed.",

Referring to FIG. 7d, the conductive circuit layer 120 may be formed on an exposed active surface of the second semiconductor chip 105 of the BGA package 100a. The conductive circuit layer 120 may further include the solder ball landing pads 121 and the conductive patterns 123, as shown in FIG. 4. If the conductive circuit layer 120 is of a tape type, the conductive circuit layer 120 may be formed the same as a metal layer used to form the bonding pad 105a on the second semiconductor chip 105.",

The solder balls 116 of the BGA package 100b may be contact the solder ball landing pads 121 of the conductive circuit layer 120 on the base BGA package 100a. Therefore, the BGA packages 100a and 100b may be electrically connected. The solder balls 116 of the BGA package 100b may be sealed by the encapsulant 140, thereby dispersing stress applied to the solder balls 116 and/or protecting the conductive circuit layer 120. Another BGA package 100c may be stacked on the BGA package 100b by the above-described method. As described above, the conductive circuit layer 120 need not be formed on the second semiconductor chip 105 of the upper BGA package 100d, and the encapsulation 113 may be formed to cover the active surface of the second semiconductor chip 105.",

For instance, a plurality of semiconductor chips 52a through 52e are stacked in a conventional package body 60 as shown in FIG. 9. One of the semiconductor chips 52a through 52e may experience an electrical failure, and as a result, the entire conventional multi-chip package may fail. However, the stacked BGA package 200 according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention may have a lower electrical/mechanical failure rate than the conventional multi chip package, by enabling the completion of testing of the unit BGA packages 100a through 100d before the stacking process.",

However, the active surface of the semiconductor chip 203 in the fourth BGA package 200d may be completely sealed because an additional BGA package need not be stacked. A plurality of solder balls 215 acting as electrical connection terminals may be attached to an underside of the printed circuit board 201. The plurality of solder balls 215 of the fourth BGA package 200d may be sealed by the encapsulant 240. In addition, a conductive circuit layer 120 may be formed on a top surface of the first BGA package 200a thereby enabling the stacking of the second BGA package 200b.",

        "As mentioned above, exemplary embodiments of the present invention may reduce the likelihood of damage to semiconductor chips and solder balls during the manufacture of stacked BGA packages. Exemplary embodiments of the present invention may also reduce the height of the stacked BGA package relative to the stacked package having one semiconductor chip in a unit package, thereby allowing a thinner stacked package to be produced. The solder balls which are connected to the unit BGA packages may be encapsulated to disperse the stress, caused by protecting the conductive circuit layer. As a result, the reliability of a semiconductor package may be improved.",
