        "The present invention relates to the driving control of a vibration type actuator including a vibrator and a contacting member that are relatively moved.",
        "To drive a vibration type actuator, an alternating driving voltage having a frequency of several tens of KHz and a voltage of several tens of Vpp is required. Therefore, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open application No. 2002-15919, a high voltage generation circuit is disclosed, which uses a low-voltage power source such as a battery, generates a high direct voltage once by a DC-DC converter, and supplies it to a driving circuit that generates the driving voltage. The output of the driving circuit is supplied to an electro-mechanical energy conversion element (piezoelectric element) via an inductor. Thereby, the alternative driving voltage amplified with a boosting effect of the inductor is supplied to the electro-mechanical energy conversion element. Further, a structure for boosting the power source voltage, which includes an amplifying circuit with a transformer, is generally used.",
        "On the other hand, there is a vibration type actuator, which reduces the driving voltage by laminating the piezoelectric elements instead of use of the above-mentioned high voltage generation circuit.",
        "However, the method using the laminated piezoelectric elements and the method for boosting the power source voltage using the DC-DC converter or the transformer increase the cost and the size of the driving circuit. In addition, using the laminated piezoelectric elements has a tendency to reduce the driving efficiency slightly in comparison with a single layer piezoelectric element.",

In other words, the drive is started at the frequency F1 higher than the resonance frequency FR, and the rotational speed is increased by bringing the driving frequency close to the resonance frequency FR.

        "V1 denotes the drain voltage of the MOSFET 3. The voltage V1 is zero during the ON state of the signal P1 because the MOSFET 3 is shorted to the ground. The voltage V1 increases to a voltage higher than the voltage V0 of the power source 1 during the OFF state of the signal P1 because the MOSFET 3 becomes the OFF state.",
        "V1 denotes the input voltage to the piezoelectric element 5. The energy accumulated in the inductor 2 during the ON state of the MOSFET 3 is transferred to the piezoelectric element 5 via the diode 4 by switching the MOSFET 3 to the OFF state, and thereby increasing the voltage V2 to a voltage higher than the voltage V0 of the power source 1.",
        "Since this voltage amplifying effect makes it possible to input a sufficient voltage to the vibrator 200 (piezoelectric element 5), a large vibration can be generated even if a power source voltage is low. The circuit structure of the present embodiment becomes simpler than a case where a booster circuit such as a DC-DC converter is used because a voltage controller is not required. Therefore, a low-cost and compact driving apparatus can be achieved.",
        "Next, the operation to discharge the energy transferred to the piezoelectric element 5 will be explained.",
        "The signal P2, which is a discharge command signal, is generated in synchronization with the signal P1. The signal P2 has a phase difference of 30 degrees with respect to the signal P1. The duty ratio of the signal P2 is 5%, and the ON period (time) of the signal P2 is shorter than that of the signal P1.",
        "The switching circuit 6 is switched to the ON state during the ON period of the signal P2. Thereby, the energy accumulated in the piezoelectric element 5 is transferred to the inductor 7, and then transferred to the power source 1. The filter circuit included in the power source 1 and constituted by an inductor L0 and a condenser C0 can sufficiently cut the vibration frequency of the vibration type actuator, and most of the electric current of the vibration frequency component flows to the condenser C0.",
        "The cycles of the signals P1 and P2 are the same because the signals P1 and P2 are formed by the pulse signals generated in the pulse generation circuit 8. The voltage V2 input to the piezoelectric element 5 becomes an alternating signal that repeats increasing and decreasing like a sine wave by switching the signals P1 and P2 alternately to the ON state. Further, the amount of the energy transferred to the piezoelectric element 5 can be changed by changing the phase difference between the signals P1 and P2. Thereby, it becomes possible to control the vibration amplitude of the vibrator 200.",
        "As described above, in the present embodiment, the pulse generation circuit 8, which receives the frequency command from the command circuit 100, generates the signals P1 and P2. In other words, the booster circuit (the inductor 2 and MOSFET 3) that inputs the amplified voltage V2 to the piezoelectric element 5 and the discharge circuit (the switching circuit 6) that discharges the energy transferred to the piezoelectric element 5 are controlled using the same driving command for the vibration type actuator. Therefore, it is possible to make the circuit structure simple.",
        "FIG. 5 shows the waveform in each part of the circuit constituting the driving apparatus for the vibration type actuator, which is Embodiment 2 of the present invention. The circuit structure of the driving apparatus of the present embodiment is the same as that of Embodiment 1 shown in FIG. 1, and the signals P1 and P2 and the voltages V1 and V2 are the same as those of Embodiment 1.",
        "In Embodiment 1, the signals P1 and P2 are switched to the ON state once in one cycle of the resonance frequency of the vibrator 200 as shown in FIG. 4. On the other hand, in the present embodiment, the signals P1 and P2 are switched to the ON state more than once in one cycle of the resonance frequency of the vibrator 200 as shown in FIG. 4. In other words, there is a period in which the signal P1 is switched to the ON state third times in a half cycle of the resonance frequency of the vibrator 200, and there is a period in which the signal P2 is switched to the ON state twice in the half cycle. In the case where the signal P2 is switched to the ON state more than once after the signal P1 is switched to the ON state more than once like this, the voltage V2 becomes a alternating signal that repeats increasing and decreasing like a sine wave by giving them a phase difference.",
        "Further, by reducing the time of each ON state of the signals P1 and P2, and switching them to the ON state more than once, it is possible to the inductance values of the inductors 2 and 7, and thereby reducing the size of the inductors 2 and 7. Reducing the size of the inductors 2 and 7 makes it possible to miniaturize the circuit constituting the driving apparatus.",
        "FIG. 6 is a diagram of the circuit constituting the driving apparatus for the vibration type actuator, which is Embodiment 3 of the present invention. In the present embodiment, the same reference numerals are used for the same constituents as in Embodiment 1.",
        "The driving apparatus of the present embodiment controls the vibration amplitude of the vibrator 200 by changing the pulse width of the signals P1 that is input to the gate of MOSFET 3 and the pulse width of the signals P2.",
        "In FIG. 6, reference numeral 9 denotes a piezoelectric element, which is a vibration detection element. The piezoelectric element 9 constitutes part of the vibrator 200. The piezoelectric element 9 detects the vibration of the vibrator 200, and outputs the signal waveform corresponding to the vibration. Reference numeral 10 denotes a pulse width control circuit (controller), which compares the output signal from the piezoelectric element 9 with an amplitude command from the command circuit (CPU) 100, and determines the pulse widths of the signals P1 and P2 based on the comparison result. Then, the pulse width control circuit 10 outputs a pulse width command for generating the signals P1 and P2 having the determined pulse widths to the pulse generation circuit 8.",
        "FIG. 7 shows an appearance in which the pulse widths of the signals P1 and P2 are changed according to the pulse width command from the pulse width control circuit 10.",
        "The signals P1 and P2 are switched to the ON state more than once in one cycle of the frequency of the main vibration component of the vibrator 200. The pulse width (the period of the ON state) of each of the signals P1 and P2 is set according to the pulse width command from the pulse width control circuit 10, and the signals P1 and P2 control the amplitude of the alternating voltage input to the piezoelectric element 5.",
        "As shown in FIG. 7, the amplitude of the waveform of the voltage V2 is changed according to the change of the pulse widths of the signals P1 and P2.",
        "Although the pulse widths of the signals P1 and P2 are changed for controlling the vibration amplitude in the present embodiment, the vibration amplitude can be controlled by changing the frequency of the signals P1 and P2 (the frequency of the main vibration component of the vibrator 200). This is apparent from the graph in FIG. 3 showing the relationship between the frequency and the driving speed.",
        "Furthermore, an example has been described, in which the vibration amplitude of the vibrator 200 is controlled in this embodiment. In contrast, the speed control of the vibration type actuator can be performed by detecting the speed instead of the vibration because the driving speed is proportional to the vibration amplitude.",
        "FIG. 8 is a figure showing the circuit structure of the driving apparatus for the vibration type actuator, which is Embodiment 4 of the present invention. In the present invention, the inductor 2 has a function of both the inductor 2 and the inductor 7 in Embodiment 1, and thereby reducing the number of the inductor and miniaturizing the circuit constituting the driving apparatus.",
        "Furthermore, although the pulse widths of the signals P1 and P2 are controlled according to the pulse width command from the pulse width control circuit 10 in Embodiment 3, the pulse widths thereof are set according to the after-mentioned waveform data stored in a memory circuit in the present embodiment.",
        "The concrete description will be given of the driving apparatus of the present invention as follows. In FIG. 8, the same reference numerals are used for the same constituents as in Embodiment 1.",
        "Reference numeral 11 denotes a reference clock generation circuit, which generates a reference clock signal, 12 a counter, which counts the reference clock signal output from the reference clock generation circuit 11. Reference numeral 13 denotes the memory, which stores data and outputs a piece of the data according to the count value of the counter 12.",
        "The waveform data, which are the above-mentioned data stored in the memory circuit 13 include waveform data relating a sine waveform, a triangular waveform, a composite waveform of them (a composite waveform of sine waveforms, composite waveform of triangular waveforms, or composite waveform of a sine and triangular waveforms), or the like. The memory circuit 13 outputs the waveform data according to the output value (count value) of the counter 12.",
        "Reference numeral 14 denotes a multiplication circuit, which multiplies the waveform data from the memory circuit 13 by a sine wave amplitude command value output from the command circuit 100. After the amplification process for the waveform data according to the sine wave amplitude command value by the multiplication circuit 14 is performed, the amplified waveform data are input to the pulse generation circuit 10 as a pulse width command signal. The pulse width command signal has a positive or negative sign; the positive signal becomes a pulse width command for the signal P1, and the negative signal becomes a pulse width command for the signal P2.",
        "Reference numeral 15 denotes a MOSFET, which is a first switching element, 16 a MOSFET, which is a second switching element. A diode included in the MOSFET 16 is used as a diode for transferring the energy accumulated in the inductor 2 to the piezoelectric element 5.",

        "Pulses of the signal P1 are generated in the positive cycle of the signal S; the signal P1 is switched to the ON state five or six times in one positive cycle. The pulse width of the signal P1 increases and decreases according to the change of the signal S, and thereby resulting in the sine-wave like change (the stepwise change along the sine wave) of the waveform of the voltage V2 that is the input voltage to the piezoelectric element 5. The phase of the waveform of the voltage V2 lags behind the signal S by approximately 90 degrees.",
        "Pulses of the signal P2 are generated in the negative cycle of the signal S; the signal P2 is switched to the ON state three or four times in one negative cycle. The pulse width of the signal P2 also increases and decreases according to the change of the signal S, as the pulse width of the signal P1.",
        "Although the description has been made in the case where the sine waveform data are output from the memory circuit 13, if other waveform data stored in the memory circuit 13 can be output, any voltage according to the other waveform data (voltage having a waveform that changes stepwise along the waveform data) can be input to the piezoelectric element 5.",
        "Furthermore, by providing a plurality of memory circuits, a waveform having a complicated shape can be formed using the waveform data output from these memory circuits.",
        "According to the present embodiment, it is possible to change the waveform of the voltage V2 input to the piezoelectric element 5 freely by changing (increasing and decreasing) the pulse width of the signal P1 according to the signal S. Thereby, it is possible to generate a waveform bringing good driving efficiency to the vibration type actuator. Further, it is possible to simultaneously generate a plurality of different vibrations in the vibrator 200 if using the above-mentioned composite waveform data.",

Further, a capacity-adjusting condenser 19 is connected in parallel with the piezoelectric element 5.",
        "It is possible to make the waveform of the alternating voltage input to the piezoelectric element 5 be a smooth waveform having a small distortion by the filter effect and the boosting effect of the inductor 17, and to amplify its amplitude. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the drain-to-source voltage of the MOSFET 15, and thereby using a low withstand voltage MOSFET as the MOSFET 15.",
