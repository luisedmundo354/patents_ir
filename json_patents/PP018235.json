        "Latin name of genus and species of the plant claimed: Vriesea sp.",
        "Variety denomination: \u2018Energy\u2019.",
        "The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Vriesea plant, botanically known as Vriesea sp., hereinafter referred to by the cultivar name \u2018Energy\u2019. The genus of Vriesea belongs to the Bromeliaceae family.",
        "The new Vriesea cultivar is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the inventors, Elly Bak and Nico D. M. Steur, in Assendelft, The Netherlands. The objective of the breeding program is to develop a new Vriesea variety good growing habit and attractive orange-yellow inflorescence.",
        "The new Vriesea cultivar \u2018Energy\u2019 originated from a cross-made in a controlled breeding program by the inventors in 1989 in Assendelft, The Netherlands. The female or seed parent is the Vriesea sp. cultivar designated \u20188932807\u2019 (unpatented). The male or pollen parent is the Vriesea sp. cultivar designated \u20188932821\u2019 (unpatented). \u2018Energy\u2019 was discovered and selected by the inventors in May of 1992, as a single flowering plant within the progeny of the stated cross in a controlled environment in Assendelft, The Netherlands.",
        "Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar \u2018Energy\u2019 performed by vegetative means by tissue culture was first performed in 1997, in Assendelft, The Netherlands. The first \u2018Energy\u2019 plants propagated through the use of tissue culture flowered in 2002, in Assendelft, The Netherlands, and have demonstrated that the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for the new cultivar are firmly fixed and retained through successive generations of asexual reproduction. The new cultivar reproduces true-to-type.",
        "The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be unique characteristics of \u2018Energy\u2019 which in combination distinguish this Vriesea as a new and distinct cultivar:\n\n    \n    \n        1. Funnel form rosette plant, measuring about 35 cm in height and about 35 cm in diameter;\n        2. Compound, orange-yellow, bipinate spike inflorescence, measuring 15-20 cm in height;\n        3. About 2 to 4 branches, measuring about 10 cm to 12 cm in length and 4 cm to 4.5 cm in width; and\n        4. Green foliage, measuring 10 cm to 35 cm in length and about 3.5 cm in width.",
        "Plants of the plants, \u20188932807\u2019 (unpatented) and \u20188932821\u2019 (unpatented), are no longer available to provide a botanical comparison with the new Vriesea cultivar \u2018Energy\u2019. Plants of the new cultivar \u2018Energy\u2019 differs from \u20188932807\u2019 with a more branched inflorescence, with less red color on a shorter stem.",
        "Of the many commercial cultivars known to the present inventors, the most similar in comparison to the new Vriesea cultivar \u2018Energy\u2019 is the Vriesea cultivar designated \u2018Miranda\u2019 (patented, EU 8129). Plants of the new cultivar \u2018Energy\u2019 differ from plant of \u2018Miranda\u2019 in a more compact growth and a lighter color.",
        "The accompanying photograph illustrates the overall appearance of the new Vriesea cultivar \u2018Energy\u2019 showing the colors as true as is reasonably possible with colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photograph may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description which accurately describes the color of \u2018Energy\u2019.",
        "The photograph shows a side view perspective of a typical potted flowering plant of \u2018Energy\u2019 at 17 months of age.",
        "\u2018Energy\u2019 has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype of the new cultivar may vary with variations in environment such as temperature, light intensity, day length, fertilizers and humidity without any change in the genotype of the plant.",
        "The aforementioned photograph, together with the following observations, measurements and values describe the new Vriesea cultivar as grown in a greenhouse in Assendelft, The Netherlands, under conditions which closely approximate those generally used in commercial practice. Plants of \u2018Energy\u2019 were grown in a greenhouse with day temperatures ranging from 20\u00b0 C. to 28\u00b0 C. and night temperatures ranging from 18\u00b0 C. to 23\u00b0 C. No artificial lighting or photoperiodic treatments were conducted, but plants of \u2018Energy\u2019 are forced into flowering by adding acetylene. The following fertilizer is added when growing plants of \u2018Energy\u2019: 1 part nitrogen, 0.6 parts phosphor, 2 parts Kalium and 0.1 parts magnesium.",
