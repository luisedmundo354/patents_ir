        "The disclosure relates to a process cartridge and an image forming apparatus equipped with the process cartridge.",
        "Conventionally, a process cartridge is loaded into an image forming apparatus, such as a laser printer. The process cartridge includes a photosensitive drum on which an electrostatic latent image is formed and a developing cartridge that develops the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum into a toner image.",
        "The developing cartridge is mounted to a drum cartridge supporting the photosensitive drum. The developing cartridge includes a developing roller that supplies toner onto a surface of the photosensitive drum. As the developing roller rotates in a state where the developing cartridge is mounted to the drum cartridge and the developing roller faces the photosensitive drum, toner is supplied to the surface of the photosensitive drum from the developing roller. An electrostatic latent image is thus developed into a toner image. The developed toner image is then transferred onto a sheet, which is fed between the photosensitive drum and the transfer roller, by the transfer roller disposed opposite the photosensitive drum.",
        "For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,751,428 discloses such a process cartridge including a locking device for maintaining a state where the developing cartridge is attached to the drum cartridge. In the process cartridge, the drum cartridge includes a shaft that extends along an upstream end face in a developing cartridge attaching direction, and a locking lever that is rotatably supported by the shaft. The developing cartridge includes a locking protrusion that protrudes therefrom toward the upstream side in the developing cartridge mounting direction. The locking lever is rotated about the shaft to engage the locking protrusion in order to prevent the developing cartridge from becoming detached from the drum cartridge. By doing so, the attachment of the developing cartridge to the drum cartridge is maintained.",
        "However, the locking lever is manually switched between a locked state where the locking lever is engaged with the locking protrusion and an unlocked state where the locking lever is disengaged from the locking protrusion. Therefore, to remove the developing cartridge from the image forming apparatus in the state where the process cartridge is mounted to the image forming apparatus, the locking lever needs to be manually disengaged from the locking protrusion and then the developing cartridge is pulled out of the image forming apparatus.",
        "The disclosure thus provides, among other things, a process cartridge that achieves an improvement in operability when a developing cartridge is detached from an image forming apparatus and an image forming apparatus including the process cartridge.",
        "An exemplary developing cartridge includes an engagement device that is capable of being engaged with an engaging member associated with a frame, wherein: the engagement device can be placed in a restricting state where the engagement device is engaged with the engaging member, the engagement device can be placed in an unrestricting state where the engagement device is disengaged from the engaging member, and the engagement device is automatically placed in the unrestricting state when the developing cartridge is placed in an image forming device.",
        "An exemplary process cartridge includes a frame; and an engaging member that is provided to the frame, wherein: the engaging member includes an engagement portion and a disengagement portion, the disengagement portion automatically moves the engaging member to a first position when the process cartridge is placed in an image forming device, and the engagement portion automatically moves the engaging member to a second position when the process cartridge is removed from the image forming device.",

In accordance with the movement of the process cartridge 19, the lower end portion of the disengagement operating portion 69 is pushed upward by the pillar member 79, so that the engaging member 65 rotates about the support shaft 64 to disengage the engaging portion 68 of the engaging member 56 from the engagement boss 66. Accordingly, the unrestricted state is established at the engaging member 65 (FIG. 2A) in the laser beam printer 1.",
        "When the process cartridge 19 is attached to the body casing 2 as described above, in conjunction with the attachment of the process cartridge 19 to the body casing 2, the engaging member 65 moves from the restricting position to the unrestricting position, so that the restriction on the detachment of the developing cartridge 20 from the frame 50 is removed at the engaging member 65. Therefore, it is unnecessary to change the position of the engaging members 65 when the developing cartridge 20 is detached from the body casing 2, so that the operability can be improved when the developing cartridge 20 is removed from the body casing 2.",
        "To remove the process cartridge 19 from the body casing 2, the drum handle 56 is operated from the front to move the process cartridge 19 forward along the mounting path 47. Then, the engagement operating portion 70 contacts the pillar member 79 after the disengagement operating portion 69 passes above the pillar member 79, and the lower end portion of the engagement operating portion 70 is pushed upward by the pillar member 79 in accordance with the movement of the process cartridge 19. Thus, the engaging member 65 rotates about the support shaft 64 to engage the engaging portion 68 of the engaging member 65 with the engagement boss 66, so that the restricted state is established at the engaging member 65 (FIG. 2B).",
        "When the process cartridge 19 is removed from the body casing 2 as described above, in conjunction with the detachment of the process cartridge 19 from the body casing 2, the position of the engaging member 65 returns to the restricting position from the unrestricting position, so that the detachment of the developing cartridge 20 from the frame 50 is restricted at the engaging members 65. Therefore, it is unnecessary to change the position of the engaging members 65 when the developing cartridge 20 is detached from the body casing 2, for example, in order to clear a paper jam, so that the operability can be improved when the process cartridge 19 is removed from the body casing 2. In addition, in the state where the process cartridge 19 is separated from the body casing 2, the developing cartridge 20 can be prevented from being easily detached from the frame 50. As a result, the exposure of the photosensitive drum 21 caused by the detachment of the developing cartridge 20 from the frame 50 can be prevented, so that damage to the photosensitive drum 21 can be prevented in the state where the process cartridge 19 is separated from the body casing 2.",
        "To remove the developing cartridge 20 from the process cartridge 19 while leaving the process cartridge 19 in the body casing 2, as shown in FIG. 3, the developing cartridge handle 63 is operated from the front to move the developing cartridge 20 forward after the hook portion 74 of the manual engaging member 72 is disengaged from the projecting portion 78 to release the restricted state at the manual engaging member 72. As should be appreciated, when the developing cartridge 20 is removed from the process cartridge 19, the engaging member 65 is in the unrestricting position. To attach the developing cartridge 20 to the process cartridge 19 while the process cartridge 19 is attached to the body casing 2, the developing cartridge handle 63 is operated from the front to move the developing cartridge 20 rearward. Then, the hook portion 74 of the manual engaging member 72 is engaged with the projecting portion 78 to establish the restricted state at the manual engaging member 72.

Accordingly, a possibility of damage to the exposed portion of the photosensitive drum 21 can be reduced.",
        "Because the drum handle 56 and the developing cartridge handle 63 are separately provided, the drum handle 56 is operated when the process cartridge 19 is attached to and detached from the body casing 2, and the developing cartridge handle 63 is operated when the developing cartridge 20 is attached to and detached from the frame 50. That is, the drum handle 56 and the developing cartridge handle 63 can be used as situation demands. Thus, the operability can be further improved during the attachment and detachment of the process cartridge 19 and the developing cartridge 20.",
        "In addition, because the drum handle 56 and the developing cartridge handle 63 are provided so as to be operated from the front, it is easier to operate the drum handle 56 and the developing cartridge handle 63 through the opening 44 of the body casing 2.

One of the engagement portions 147 is engaged with a step portion provided behind the shaft insertion portion 143 and another is fixed at the inner surface of the front side-plate-portion 53 of the frame 50 by a spring fixing portion 149 provided at a diagonally front upper position with respect to the support shaft 140 while the wound portion 147 of the torsion spring 146 is wound around the support shaft 140.",
        "The engagement boss 142 outwardly protrudes from the side wall 58 of the housing 48 of the developing cartridge 20 in the width direction. As shown in FIG. 10B, the engagement boss 142 is provided at a position where the engaging member 141 inclinatory extends with respect to the longitudinal direction of the front side-plate-portion 53 of the frame 50 when the developing cartridge 20 is attached to the frame 50 and the engaging portion 145 of the engaging member 141 is engaged with the engagement boss 142 when the guided portion 144 protrudes from the lower edge of the frame 50. When the engaging portion 145 is engaged with the engagement boss 142, the restricted state where the detachment of the developing cartridge 20 from the frame 50 is restricted is established. When the engaging portion 145 is disengaged with the engagement boss 142, the unrestricted state where the detachment of the developing cartridge 20 from the frame 50 is permitted is established.",
        "In the body casing 2, a guiding member 150 as a first contact portion is provided in order to guide the guided portion 144 of the engaging member 141 during the attachment and detachment of the process cartridge 19 with respect to the body casing 2. The guiding member 150 includes an inclined plane 151, which ascends rearward, and a horizontal plane 152, which extends substantially in the horizontal direction from an upper end (a rear end) of the inclined plane 151.",
        "The inclined plane 151 of the guiding member 150 is disposed at a position where the guided portion 144 of the engaging member 141 protruding from the lower edge of the engaging member 141 contacts the included plane 151 when the process cartridge 19 is attached to the body casing 2. When the process cartridge 19 is further moved in the attaching direction after the guided portion 144 of the engaging member 141 contacts the inclined plane 151, the guided portion 144 is moved over the inclined plane 151 toward the horizontal plane 152. In accordance with this movement, the engaging member 141 rotates in a direction to accommodate the guided portion 144 in the frame 50 against the urging force from the torsion spring 146. Thus, the engaging portion 145 of the engaging member 141 is disengaged from the engagement boss 142, so that the restriction on the detachment of the developing cartridge 20 from the casing 50 is removed (FIG. 10A). Therefore, it is unnecessary to change the position of the engaging member 141 when the developing cartridge 20 is detached from the body casing 2, so that operability can be improved when the developing cartridge 20 is detached from the body casing 2.",
        "When the process cartridge 19 is detached from the body casing 2, the guided portion 144 of the engaging member 141 is moved over the horizontal plane 152 of the guiding member 150 toward the inclined plane 151 in accordance with the movement of the process cartridge 19 in the detaching direction. When the process cartridge 19 is further moved in the detaching direction after the guided portion 144 reaches the inclined plane 151, the engaging member 141 rotates in the direction to allow the guided portion 144 to protrude from the lower edge of the frame 50 by the urging force from the torsion spring 111 while the guided portion 144 is guided by the inclined plane 151. Therefore, the engaging portion 145 is engaged with the engagement boss 142, so that the detachment of the developing cartridge 20 from the frame 50 is restricted (FIG. 10B). Accordingly, it is unnecessary to change the position of the engaging member 141 when the process cartridge 19 is detached from the body casing 2, for example, in order to clear a paper jam, so that the operability can be improved when the process cartridge 19 is detached from the body casing 2.",
        "In the state whew the process cartridge 19 is detached from the body casing 2, the engaging member 141 almost stays between the developing cartridge 20 and the frame 50, so that it is difficult to manually operate the engaging member 141. Accordingly, the developing cartridge 20 can be further prevented from being easily detached from the frame 50. As a result, the exposure of the photosensitive drum 21 caused by the detachment of the developing cartridge 20 from the frame 50 can be prevented, so that damage to the photosensitive drum 21 can be prevented in the state where the developing cartridge 20 is detached.",
        "In this embodiment, instead of having the engagement device on each side, the process cartridge 19 may have the engagement device on only one side.",
        "Although, in the above described embodiments, the explanations have been made as to the operation performed at one side only, the same operation is performed at the other side of the process cartridge 19.",
        "According to the above embodiments, when the process cartridge is attached to the image forming apparatus while the detachment of the developing cartridge from the frame is restricted by the engagement device, the engagement device is changed from the restricting state to the unrestricting state by the release device, so that the restriction on the detachment of the developing cartridge from the frame is released. Therefore, it is unnecessary to change the state of the engagement device. Thus, the operability can be improved when the developing cartridge is removed from the image forming apparatus.",
        "When the process cartridge is attached to the image forming apparatus, the release member contacts the first contact member and then the engaging member rotates about the support shaft in a direction to disengage from the engaged portion in accordance with the movement of the process cartridge in the attaching direction. Therefore, in conjunction with the attachment of the process cartridge to the image forming apparatus, the restriction on the detachment of the developing cartridge from the frame imposed by the engagement device can be surely removed.",
        "When the process cartridge is attached to the image forming apparatus, the second release portion contacts the third contact portion and then the engaging member rotates about the support shaft in a direction to disengage from the engaged portion in accordance with the movement of the process cartridge in the attaching direction. Therefore, in conjunction with the attachment of the process cartridge to the image forming apparatus, the restriction on the detachment of the developing cartridge from the frame imposed by the engagement device can be surely removed.",
        "When the process cartridge is detached from the image forming apparatus, the engagement device returns to the restricting state from the unrestricting state, so that the detachment of the developing cartridge from the frame is restricted. Therefore, it is unnecessary to change the state of the engaging device when the process cartridge is detached from the image forming apparatus, for example, in order to clear a paper jam, so that the operability can be improved when the process cartridge is removed from the image forming apparatus. In addition, the developing cartridge can be prevented from being easily detached from the frame in the state where the process cartridge is detached from the image forming apparatus. As a result, the exposure of the image forming apparatus caused by the detachment of the developing cartridge from the frame can be prevented, thereby preventing damage to the image forming apparatus in the state where the process cartridge is detached from the image forming apparatus.",
        "When the process cartridge is detached from the image forming apparatus, the retuning member contacts the first contact portion and then the engaging member rotates about the support shaft in a direction to engage the engaged portion in accordance with the movement of the process cartridge in the detaching direction. Therefore, in conjunction with the detachment of the process cartridge from the image forming apparatus, the restricted state where the detachment of the developing cartridge from the frame is restricted can be surely established.",
        "The process cartridge includes the manual engagement device that can change between the restricting state where the detachment of the developing cartridge from the frame is restricted and the unrestricting state where the detachment of the developing cartridge from the frame is permitted. Therefore, the detachment of the developing cartridge from the frame can be restricted. Thus, the developing cartridge can be further surely prevented from being detached from the frame, so that damage to the image holding body can be further prevented.",
        "By manual operation, the second engaging member is rotated to engage the second engaging member with the second engaged member for restricting the detachment of the developing cartridge from the frame and to disengage the second engaging member from the second engaged member for removing the restriction on the detachment of the developing cartridge from the frame. Accordingly, the detachment of the developing cartridge can be restricted and permitted by the simple manual operation.",
        "When the process cartridge is attached to and detached from the image forming apparatus by operating the frame-side operating portion, the third engaging member slides in the process cartridge attaching/detaching direction, so that the third engaging member is engaged with and disengaged from the third engaged portion. Thus, the manual engagement device can change between the restricting state and the unrestricting state.",
        "The frame-side operating portion and the developing-cartridge-side operating portion are separately provided. That is, the frame-side operating portion and the developing-cartridge-side operating portion can be used as situation demands. That is, the frame-side operating portion is operated when the process cartridge is attached to and detached from the image forming apparatus, and the developing-cartridge-side operating portion is operated when the developing cartridge is attached to and detached from the frame. Thus, the operability can be further improved when the process cartridge and the developing cartridge are attached to and detached from the image forming apparatus.",
        "The frame-side operating portion and the developing-cartridge-side operating portion can be operated from the same side, so that the operability can be further improved when the process cartridge and the developing cartridge are attached to and detached from the image forming apparatus.",
        "In the state where the process cartridge is attached to the image forming apparatus, the developing-cartridge-side operating portion protrudes from the developing cartridge, so that the usability of the developing-cartridge-side operating portion can be increased. Therefore, the operability can be improved when the developing cartridge is removed from the image forming apparatus.",
        "When the process cartridge is attached to the image forming apparatus, the boss of the rotating member contacts the second contact portion and then the rotating member rotates about the support shaft in accordance with the movement of the process cartridge in the attaching direction. Then, the developing-cartridge-side operating portion protrudes from the developing cartridge. Accordingly, in conjunction with the attachment of the process cartridge to the image forming apparatus, the developing-cartridge-side operating portion can be surely positioned at the operable position where the developing-cartridge-side operating portion protrudes from the developing cartridge.",
        "In the state where the process cartridge is detached from the image forming apparatus, the urging member urges the developing-cartridge-side operating portion toward the standby position. Accordingly, when the process cartridge is detached from the image forming apparatus, the developing-cartridge-side operating portion returns to the standby position from the operable position, so that the operability can be further increased.",
        "In the state where the process cartridge is attached to the image forming apparatus, the developing cartridge is urged toward the image holding body by the pressing device. Therefore, the image holding body can hold a developing agent image by which developing agent is surely supplied to the surface of the image holding body. In addition, when the developing cartridge is removed from the frame, the pressure on the developing cartridge applied by the pressing device can be removed by the pressure release device, so that the developing cartridge can be unforcedly removed from the frame.",
        "In conjunction with the opening of the cover member, the pressure on the developing cartridge applied by the pressing device can be removed. Therefore, the operability can be improved when the developing cartridge is removed from the image forming apparatus.",
        "When the cover member is open, the cover member and the pressing lever are out of contact with each other, so that the pressure on the developing cartridge applied by the pressing device is removed. When the cover member is closed, the cover member and the pressing lever are in contact with each other, so that the developing cartridge is pressed by the pressing device. Accordingly, in conjunction with the opening and closing of the cover member, the pressure by the pressing device can be surely applied to and removed from the developing cartridge.",
        "In the state where the process cartridge is detached from the image forming apparatus, the portion, facing the transfer device, of the image holding body is exposed. Therefore, when the developing cartridge is separated from the frame in the state where the process cartridge is detached from the image forming apparatus, the portion, facing the developing cartridge of the image holding device is further exposed and the exposed portion of the image holding body is expanded. When the detachment of the developing cartridge is restricted in the state where the process cartridge is detached from the image forming apparatus, the expansion of the exposed portion of the image holding body can be prevented. Accordingly, a possibility of damage to the exposed portion of the image holding body can be reduced.",
        "While the disclosure has been described in detail with reference to the specific embodiments thereof, it would be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes, arrangements and modifications may be applied therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure."
