        "1. Technical Field",
        "The present invention relates to monitoring data, and in some embodiments may concern assessing the medical condition of a patient. More particularly, some examples of the invention concern using a subcutaneous sensor to measure a characteristic of tissue in a patient, and in some examples may be used to measure tissue pH to detect shock, or to determine if tissue is viable.",
        "2. Description of Related Art",
        "Improved casualty/patient care is vital to military operational practices, and is also of great importance in many civilian environments. For example, frequently it is important for a medical care provider to be able to quickly and accurately assess the medical condition of a patient in a combat environment, during disaster relief, at an accident scene, during patient transport, in an emergency room, at a hospital, or at any other location during a medical emergency or the general treatment of a patient.",
        "Shock is one of the body's biochemical reactions to an injury. The presence of hypoglycemic or hemorrhagic shock, which frequently occurs in combat casualties and accident victims, must be rapidly and accurately assessed, and must be monitored, to ensure the best prognosis, final patient disposition, and maximum survival rates.",
        "Detecting depression of a patient's vital signs (blood pressure, respiration and heart rate), is a known method for detecting shock. This technique may be used in the field and other environments. However, this method is imprecise and is not favored if other methods are available.",
        "Two methods are known that generally have been used for monitoring the shock state of a patient in a hospital environment. In the first method, global blood flow assessments are made by measuring arterial Pa(O2) oxygen delivery to the body. In the second method, arterial blood lactate concentrations and oxygen consumption are measured. Both of these techniques are invasive and hence may negatively impact the patient's health, because they generally require drawing blood with a catheter (perhaps from the stomach), and also require sophisticated equipment, and consequently cannot be used in the field.",
        "Tissue tonometry is a tissue oriented approach to measuring and diagnosing the shock state of a patient. Tissue P(O2) levels, tissue P(CO2) levels, and tissue pH, have been shown to be reliable estimates of a compensated shock state. However, the use of these approaches has been hampered by the lack of a reliable and noninvasive method of obtaining accurate measurements.",
        "In combat, disaster, and accident scenarios, the extent of injury to a patient may be so severe as to require amputation of gangrenous tissue. Gangrenous tissue is tissue that has died due to lack of blood supply. Dead tissue may also be present on frostbite victims. Generally, the goal of an amputation is to remove all dead tissue. The extent of tissue removal during an amputation may be excessive, because medical personnel lack an accurate means of determining the demarcation between viable and non-viable tissue.",
        "In summary, known methods of measuring the shock state of a patient are inadequate because they are invasive, non-portable, and/or inaccurate. Further, known methods for identifying and monitoring the border between viable and non-viable tissue are not sufficiently accurate to preclude needless amputation of viable tissue. Additionally, there is no known means of monitoring the continued viability of tissue after an amputation.",
        "One embodiment is a microprobe. An example of the microprobe comprises a housing having an aperture. This example of the microprobe also comprises an ISFET attached to the housing. The ISFET may have a gate located proximate the aperture. This example of the microprobe further comprises a reference electrode attached to the housing proximate the aperture.",
        "Other embodiments are described in the sections below, and include, for example, a microsensor system, a microsensor array system, a method for monitoring data (which in some examples may be a characteristic of tissue), and a signal bearing medium tangibly embodying a program of machine-readable instructions executable by a digital processing apparatus to perform a method for monitoring data (which is some examples may be a characteristic of tissue).",
        "Some embodiments provide for portably, noninvasively, and accurately measuring and monitoring the shock state of a patient, and further, some embodiments may accurately identify viable and non-viable tissue.",

        "The nature, objectives, and advantages of the invention will become more apparent to those skilled in the art after considering the following detailed description in connection with the accompanying drawings.",
        "The present invention generally relates to monitoring data. Some embodiments provide a microvascular technique for measuring a characteristic of tissue in a patient. Some specific examples concern injecting a microprobe in dermal tissue, to quickly and relatively non-invasively measure dermal tissue pH. Although an embodiment for measuring tissue pH is discussed in this introduction, the invention is not limited to this specific illustrative example.",
        "Real-time measurement of dermal tissue pH (the pH of the vascular layer of the skin), can be used to monitor the general onset of shock. Some examples of the invention provide a real-time microsensor system for measuring tissue pH in the vascular layer of skin, and consequently may be used to detect and provide an early warning for the onset of hypoglycemic or hemorrhagic shock. Thus, the microsensor system provides a relatively non-invasive, portable instrument for monitoring the general onset of shock. The microprobe may be implanted in the dermis in almost any location on a human body, including the fingers and toes, which are desirable locations for measuring shock.",
        "The microsensor system may also be used to identify viable tissue, for example before, during, and/or after an amputation or other surgery. One important application is identifying and/or monitoring viable and non-viable tissue in frostbite patients. Another important application is identifying and/or monitoring gangrenous and non-gangrenous tissue. Another application is identifying and/or monitoring non-viable tissue after a patient has been exposed to severe radiation. In circumstance where non-viable tissue must be amputated, a plurality of microprobes could be placed in different locations in patient tissue, to gather information that may be presented as a three dimensional representation of the patient tissue, so that a surgeon can determine precisely which tissue to remove (and also which tissue that possibly may be revived).",
        "The microsensor system could also be used to determine whether there is adequate capillary fill after removing a tourniquet. In another example, the microsensor system could be used to detect and/or monitor indicators of heart blockage (may be indicated by no change after implementation of an intervention) or congestive heart failure. Statistical algorithms may be performed using data gathered over a period of time, to identify trends and other useful information in the data.",
        "As an example, the microsensor system with or without the patient status monitor could be routinely used by medics and corpsmen on the battlefield, and also could be used by surgeons and other personnel at forward medical units. The microsensor system with or without the patient status monitor could also be used in disaster scenarios, and by emergency medical teams. The microsensor system with or without the patient status monitor could be used to assist in establishing patient triage, and generally could result in improved urgent care and increased patient survival rates. The microsensor system and the patient status monitor generally provide enhanced functionality, sensitivity, and accuracy.",

The apparatus for monitoring patient status may be used in conjunction with, or may be incorporated into, the microsensor system. As an example, the apparatus for monitoring patient status may be embodied by the hardware components and interconnections of the patient status monitor 10 shown in FIG. 1. The patient status monitor 10 includes a patient status data processor 12.",
        "One or more data collection devices are coupled to the patient status data processor 12, for sensing or otherwise receiving data. As an example, the data collection devices may include one or more medical sign sensors 14, one or more medical lab data test sensors 16, and/or one or more intervention data collectors 18. One or more of the medical sign sensors 14 may be a microprobe 1302 (shown in FIG. 13), or a microprobe system 1300 (shown in FIG. 13), (which may gather tissue pH information and possibly other information), and which will be discussed below.",
        "The patient status data processor 12 may be coupled to one or more output devices, which may include, for example, one or more displays 20, one or more printers 22, and/or one or more data archives 24. Display 20 may include a visible and/or audible alarm and/or other means to convey an alarm condition. For example, the display may include a speaker or buzzer or other audio transducer for producing an audio alarm. As another example, a visible alarm may be presented on the display, or a LED could be included on the display housing for indicating an alarm. The medical sign sensor 14 and medical lab data test sensors 16 sense or otherwise receive information such as, for example the following data types, pulse rate, blood pressure, respiration, body temperature, white blood cell count, iron, cholesterol, triglyceride, blood sugar, tissue pH, and blood gas information for a patient, and output data values representative of the medical signs and lab tests, as data to the patient status data processor 12. The intervention data collector 18 gathers information concerning actions taken to correct problems, upper and lower patient reference values, upper and lower patient threshold values, and other significant actions as well as how long a data type value can remain unchanged before an alarm should sound that an intervention is not working. For example, the intervention data collector 18 may receive data concerning when medication is administered or when the patient was covered with a blanket. The intervention data may be date/time stamped.",
        "The patient status data processor 12 may be any type of data processing apparatus, and as an example, may be a microprocessor or computer.

Alternatively, the memory 28 and/or the nonvolatile storage 30 may be eliminated, and further, memory and/or nonvolatile storage may be provided on-board the processor 26, or externally to the patient status data processor 12.",

Interface 1306 may include electrical wires, optical fiber or wireless data and/or power transmission means.",
        "FIG. 14 is a diagram of the microprobe 1302 (which may be called a tissue microprobe). The microprobe 1302 must be small enough to not cause an adverse reaction in the human body, or a reaction that would interfere with obtaining accurate data. The microprobe 1302 includes a housing 1402 having an aperture 1404. The housing 1402 may have a tab 1403 for limiting the extent of incursion of the microprobe 1302 into the dermis. The microprobe 1302 also includes an ion sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET) microsensor 1406, which is attached to the housing 1402 (which may also be called an encapsulant). The ISFET 1406 has a gate 1408 located proximate the aperture 1404, as well as a source and a drain (shown and discussed with reference to FIG. 19 below). The microprobe 1302 also includes a reference electrode 1410 (which may be called a reference microelectrode), which is attached to the housing 1402 proximate the aperture 1404. As an example, the reference electrode 1410 may be made of silver (Ag), silver chloride (AgCl), Pt, or with functionally equivalent material. At least a portion of the gate 1408 and at least a portion of the reference electrode 1410 may be located within the aperture 1404. However, depending upon the exact structure of the microprobe 1302, especially in its microfabricated form, the housing 1402 and aperture 1404 may be only functionally present. Said housing 1402 may only comprise the substrate upon which all components are fabricated in sequence, such as a sapphire substrate, or an encapsulate layer, which by example might be a thin SiN4 layer, deposited or otherwise formed in regions that without the encapsulate, would not be biocompatible. As an example, the housing and the ISFET may be integrally formed in biocompatible material. As another example, the housing and the reference electrode may be integrally formed in biocompatible material. In some examples, the housing may be made of sapphire. Herein components (for example, the housing, ISFET, reference electrode and/or substrate) that are \u201cattached\u201d may be separate pieces that are secured together, or integrally formed components.",
        "ISFETs have a structure that is similar to metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), which are commonly used in low power microelectronics. Generally, in field effect transistors, a current flow occurs between source and drain regions, in response to modulation of channel conductivity by the gate region. In a conventional MOSFET, a voltage is applied to a metal gate to perform the modulation. In the case of an ISFET, modulation occurs by changing the surface charge on a bare gate insulator. The surface charge may change in response to the protonization-deprotonization of the gate insulator in the presence of a solution. The protonization-deprotonization is directly related to the pH of the solution.",
        "The reference electrode 1410 may be used to complete the electrical circuit. Direct measurement of the pH of the solution may be obtained by measuring a shift in the threshold voltage (the onset of source-drain current), or by measuring the source-drain current, of the ISFET. The current flow may be coupled to a display and scaled to provide a pH readout. Thus, in some applications the ISFET may be used to measure the pH of tissue. In some examples, the microprobe could also have a blood gas sensor, which could be a second ISFET, or a single ISFET could be used for sensing blood gas rather than pH. Due to the miniaturization of the microprobe system, a plurality of sensing elements or arrays of elements could be included in the microprobe.",
        "The microprobe 1302 may also include associated electronics circuitry 1412 attached to the housing 1402. The associated electronic circuitry 1412 need not be placed in or proximate the aperture 1404, and may be protected inside the housing 1402. In FIG. 14 a breakaway of the housing 1402 is indicated to render the associated electronics circuitry 1412 visible. As an example, the circuitry 1412 may be a temperature sensing diode or another type of sensor. In another example, the circuitry 1412 could be logic circuitry, which for example could be a logic array or a microprocessor, which could permit the microprobe 1302 to perform statistical algorithms and other logical and mathematical operations (thereby operating as a smart sensor). The ISFET 1406 and the reference electrode 1410, and also if desired the associated circuitry 1412, may be monolithically integrated. The ISFET 1406 and the reference electrode 1410, and also if desired the associated circuitry 1412, may be formed on a substrate 1414 that is attached to the housing 1402. The housing 1402 may substantially encapsulate and may hermetically seal the substrate 1414 except for a portion of the substrate 1414 within the aperture 1404, wherein at least a portion of the gate 1408 and at least a portion of the reference electrode 1410, are attached to the substrate 1414 within the aperture 1404. Thus, the housing 1402 may hermetically seal the ISFET 1406 and the reference electrode 1410, except for portions of the ISFET 1406, the reference electrode 1410 that are within the aperture 1404, to permit contact between the components in the aperture 1404 and the tissue being measured. Accordingly, the microprobe 1302 defines an exterior space that is exterior to the microprobe 1302, wherein at least a portion of the gate 1408 and at least a portion of the reference electrode 1410, are in fluid communication with the exterior space. The microprobe 1302 may be shaped, for example, as a small needle, as a cylinder, or in any other appropriate shape. The housing 1402 may be made of any suitable biocompatible material, and as an example, may comprise silicon nitride.",
        "The microprobe 1302 also has a power/electronic interface 1416, for supplying power to the microprobe 1302, and for outputting data signals from the microprobe 1302 to the control module 1304. The power/electronic interface may be coupled to the ISFET 1406, the reference electrode 1410, and the associated circuitry 1412. In one example, the power/electronic interface 1416 is three wires (power, ground, and signal). In other embodiments, one, two, four or more wires could be used. The wires of the power/electronic 1416 interface may be long enough to connect the microprobe to the control module 1304, or may extend only a short distance from the microprobe 1302, in which case additional wires may be used to connect the microprobe to the control module 1304. Alternatively, the wires of the power/electronic interface 1416 may only reach to within the microprobe 1302, and could be attached to a socket on the microprobe 1302, which could be coupled to additional wiring to connect the microprobe 1302 to the control module 1304. Other methods could be used to couple the microprobe 1302 to the control module 1304. For example, the power/electronic interface 1416 could include a fiber-optic interface (and possibly fiber optic cable), and a fiber-optic link could be connected between the power/electronic interface 1416 and the control module 1304, for transmitting data to the control module 1304. In other embodiments, the power/electronic interface 1416 could include an electromagnetic transmitter (and possibly a receiver), for permitting untethered communications between the microprobe and the control module, and for leaving the patient untethered. For example, the electromagnetic communications could utilize free-space optical, radio-frequency, microwave, or generally any other suitable frequencies of electromagnetic waves. As an example, data signals could be wirelessly transmitted from the microprobe 1302 to the control module 1304. In examples of the microsensor system 1300 in which a plurality of microprobes 1302 are simultaneously utilized, untethered communications may be particularly useful for permitting the control module 1304 to simultaneously monitor the plurality of microprobes 1302, without having a large number of wires or fiber optic cables.",
        "The microprobe 1302 may receive power from the control module 1304, for example, via one or more wires connected to the microprobe 1302 and the control module 1304. Alternatively, a separate power supply could be used to supply power to the microprobe 1302. Alternatively, the microprobe 1302 could include a power source 1417, which is coupled to the ISFET 1406, and which may also be coupled to the reference electrode 1410. For example, the power source 1417 could be a battery coupled to the ISFET 1406, for supplying power to the ISFET. In other examples, the power source 1417 could include a photo-voltaic electrical generator, a radioisotope-based power generator, a chemical power generator, or a kinematic power generator, coupled to the ISFET 1406. In another example, the power source 1417 could include an antenna and a capacitor, wherein the capacitor is coupled to the ISFET 1406, and the antenna is coupled to the capacitor, and wherein the capacitor is configured to store electromagnetic energy received by the antenna (for example, a pulse or series of waves), to provide power for the microprobe 1302.",
        "The microprobe 1302 could also include a calibrant 1418 (material used for calibrating), which could be a liquid, gel, powder, solid, or gas, which is placed in contact with the gate 1408 of the ISFET 1406 and with the reference electrode 1410, for calibrating and/or testing the microprobe 1302. Alternatively, the calibrant could be included as part of the microprobe delivery system 1303 (discussed below). As an example, the calibrant 1418 could be a saline solution. The microprobe 1302 could be tested and/or calibrated, by reading the pH of the saline solution, before the microprobe 1302 is located in the tissue to be measured. If the microprobe 1302 being tested outputs erroneous data, the microprobe 1302 can be discarded, and another microprobe 1302 can be used.

        "The mean and standard deviation may be derived from the currently available data points x1, . . . , xn that have been inputted, or may be derived from a baseline data set xK, . . . , xL identified during a baseline reset. \u201cn\u201d is defined as the current number of data points entered if the baseline mean and standard deviation have not been set, and is the last data point used to create an acceptable baseline mean and standard deviation after the mean and standard deviation are set for the first time. (The letter \u201cm\u201d is sometimes used instead of the letter \u201cn\u201d.) The mean and standard deviation may be, when needed, calculated and reset a number of times. During the operation 614 of obtaining the baseline mean and standard deviation, non-conforming data points may be identified and removed from the baseline data set. A variable \u201cr\u201d is set equal to the number of data points removed from consideration either a priori by the user or because they are found to be non-conforming data points. When the mean and standard deviation are calculated from the incoming data, four Shewhart tests are used to remove and flag outliers in the mean and standard deviation calculations. A point that is three standard deviations or more from the mean is flagged as a burst point. A point that is between two and three standard deviations from the mean is flagged as an outlier point. Burst and outlier data points are removed from the calculations if their removal does not cause the standard deviation to be zero. The process is continued until the standard deviation is non-zero and at least seven points that meet these criteria are found. The resultant mean and standard deviation are used in the signal detection tests. An adjustment may be made in the non-conforming data point removal when the data is discrete instead of continuous.",

        "Statistical methods used for medical monitoring may be categorized in two different categories. The first category includes statistical methods that are concerned with detecting sharp changes which are stark departures from historic levels, and that often, rapidly, return to the norm, and which are called a burst or outlier. Moving average charts and proportion charts are examples of the first type of statistical method. The second category includes statistical methods that are concerned with smaller deviations from historic levels that are sustained over an extended period of time, and which are known as a shift or trend. Linear regression and Cumulative Sums (CUSUM) are examples of the second type of statistic. Additionally, two-state Markov statistics such as the CUSUM statistic are useful for detecting shifts and trends in data, and can provide an estimate of the beginning and end of a signal. Four small-sample two-state Markov statistics may be used to detect trends and shifts in the data and to determine the beginning and end of a signal. The detection and removal of normal cyclic variation could be added to these algorithms to remove artifacts that may produce false alarms and therefore improve the detection of clinically significant events. Alternative embodiments could also include operations for forecasting the value of the data type for some time in the future using methods known to the art such as polynomial regression line fit. Additionally, alternative embodiments could include operations for reconstructing the signal present in data points (such as data points K through L discussed below).",

Condition 1 may occur because the initial data points used in calculating the mean and standard deviation contained a signal and was not noise only data. Condition 1 may also indicate an improvement in the patient's status. For example a patient's drop in mean diastolic value from 105 to 100, which is still high, is an improved mean.

        "To summarize, an example of one embodiment is a windowed adaptive recursive method for monitoring patient status, and tissue status, by detecting non-conforming data, shifts, and trends in medical sign and lab data, capturing information on medical interventions, comparing the results to the normal value range and/or to a user specified patient reference range, and displaying the results. One embodiment may be described as a windowed adaptive recursive method for monitoring patient status, and tissue status, comprising the steps of: initializing the process; receiving information on medical interventions and medical sign and lab data; detecting changes in incoming medical sign and lab data, calculating a mean and standard deviation if needed from the incoming data or from a baseline data set identified for use in the calculation and identifying and removing non-conforming data points from the data set, calculating various test statistics, testing to determine if the last entered data point is non-conforming, determining the direction of any signal present, determining if any trends and shifts in the data set are statistically significant, determining if detected shifts and trends are toward or away from a reference range, determining if a no change condition has lasted too long, resetting the baseline data set, detecting medical sign data points above or below a normal value threshold, marking the data point above the normal range, within the normal range, and below the normal range, and storing and displaying the data and results for the last window of data points and medical interventions.",
        "Many embodiments give medical caregivers immediate feedback regarding the status of a patient, and facilitate rapid implementation of interventions based on causal relationships between current treatments and medical sign and lab test changes. In view of the practice of transporting less stable patients in combat environments to hospitals in rear echelons, the rapid response facilitated by improved patient monitoring is beneficial because of the greater risk that a patient's condition will change during transport. Also, constraints on medical resources during transit make rapid responses to changes in a patient's condition imperative. Further, a pre-specified integration time or a constant data rate is not required. Therefore, data from unscheduled patient visits and random measurements taken during combat evacuations can be used, rather than requiring measurements to be taken according to a predetermined pattern. Because the methods and algorithms used for implementing various embodiments may be used with low data rates, these embodiments are particularly useful with the limited amounts of data encountered in combat casualty care and ambulatory patient care settings. Various embodiments could also be beneficially utilized for monitoring patients in a critical care facility.",
        "Examples of computer implemented steps for implementing portions of sequence 600 are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/423,568, filed 25 Apr. 2003, titled \u201cMethod and System for Detecting Changes in Data\u201d, which is incorporated herein by this reference. However, it is to be understood that these computer implemented steps may also be written using other programming languages.",
        "An example of a method embodiment is illustrated in FIGS. 21A-B, which show a sequence 2100 for a method for measuring and/or monitoring one or more characteristics of tissue. As an example, the characteristic may be tissue pH. Additionally or alternatively, the characteristic could be blood gas. Additionally, the temperature of the tissue could also be measured. For ease of explanation, but without any intended limitation, the example of FIGS. 21A-B is described in the context of the microsensor system 1300 described above. The sequence 2100 may begin with operation 2102, which comprises providing the microsensor system 1300. The sequence 2100 may also include operation 2104, which comprises opening a package containing the sterile microprobe 1302 and delivery system 1303, 1702 and removing the sterile microprobe 1302 and delivery system 1303, 1702 for subsequent use. The sequence 2100 may also include operation 2106, which comprises operationally coupling the control module 1304 to the microprobe 1302, for example with electrical wiring. The sequence 2100, may also include operation 2108, which comprises placing a calibrant in contact with the gate 1408 of the ISFET 1406 and with the reference electrode 1410 of the microprobe 1302. Calibration/testing of the microprobe 1302 is performed while the microprobe 1302 is in contact with the calibrant 1418 (which may be positioned within the microprobe delivery system 1303, 1702). The sequence 2100 may also include operation 2110, which comprises measuring the current flow between the source and the drain of the ISFET, as part of the calibration procedure. As part of the calibration/testing of the microprobe 1302, the sequence 2100 may also include operation 2112, which comprises determining if the current flow is in an acceptable range. If the current flow is not in an acceptable range, in operation 2113 the microprobe 1302 may be discarded and replaced with another microprobe 1302, and the process may resume at operation 2106. Built-in test algorithms may also be employed to reconfigure microprobe 1302 as noted previously.",
        "Sequence 2100 may also include operation 2114 which comprises positioning the gate 1408 of the ISFET 1406, and the reference electrode 1410, in tissue of interest (or in contact with, or in fluid communication with the tissue of interest). As an example, operation 2114 may be accomplished by positioning the microprobe 1302 in the tissue of interest by actuating an actuator 1602, 1704 in a microprobe delivery system 1303, 1702. As an example, the tissue of interest may be skin (which may be in a casualty patient). As an example, the microsensor (or microsensors) 1302 may be positioned in the dermis in fingers or toes, which is a useful location for monitoring shock. Alternatively, a microsensor (or microsensors) 1302 could be positioned near the heart to detect heart blockage or congestive heart failure. The microprobe 1302 may be positioned in the dermis generally anywhere on a patient's body.",
        "The sequence 2100 may also include operation 2116, which comprises measuring the current flow between the source 1504 and the drain 1506 of the ISFET 1406. The sequence 2100 may also include operation 2118, which comprises sending a representation of the current flow to the control module 1304. Although a single reading is useful, repeated or continuous monitoring permits performing additional analysis, and permits applying statistical techniques on the data, such as the DCD process discussed above and in the related applications referenced above. Although a single reading from a microprobe 1302 that quickly fails would be useful, a functioning microprobe 1302 could be left in the dermis for a long period of time, for example several days, during which data could be gathered. The microsensor system 1300 may be utilized to provide constant real time information during a medical procedure such as an amputation. In other applications, the microsensor system 1300 may be used to periodically monitor the condition of a patient (for example while warming a patient).",
        "The sequence 2100 may further include operation 2120, which comprises outputting results, which may include a representation of the pH of the tissue (and possibly other information concerning the tissue and analysis of the data). The results could also include any of the output discussed above with reference to the patient status monitor 10. As an example, if multiple microprobes 1302 are simultaneously utilized and monitored by the control module 1304, the results may include a three dimensional representation of the pH of the tissue (and possibly other characteristics of the tissue, such as temperature and/or blood gas levels and/or blood flow information). In a specific example, if multiple microprobes 1302 are positioned in a patient's hand, the results could include a three dimensional display of the hand showing characteristics of the dermis of the hand where the microprobes 1302 are located, and may also display an alert status on the three dimension display. In some examples a volumetric, holographic, stereoscopic or virtual three dimensional display could be employed and manipulated by the user for alternative views.",
        "Thus, whether a single microprobe 1302 or multiple microprobes 1302 are monitored, after the microprobe (or microprobes) 1302 is appropriately positioned within the desired tissue, for example using microprobe delivery system 1303, 1702, tissue pH and/or temperature, as well as, trends, shifts, variance and trends in the variance, of the pH and/or temperature, and/or a trauma score, may be measured, computed, and displayed on the display 1812 of the control module 1304. To perform the analysis of the data received from the microprobe 1302 (or from multiple microprobes 1302), the control module 1304 may perform calculations described above with regard to the patient status monitor 10, and/or described in the related applications referenced above, and/or described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,671,734, issued Sep. 30, 1997, titled \u201cAutomatic Medical Sign Monitor\u201d, which is incorporated herein by reference. The control module 1304 may also provide an estimate of the probability of the onset of shock and/or death. For example within a user specified period of time based on the application of survival analysis on raw data and/or a trauma score. Depending on the particular hardware arrangement, the calculations and analysis may be performed by the control module 1304, or by the patient status data processor 12, or by the control module 1304 in conjunction with the patient status data processor 12. The sequence 2100 may also include operation 2122, which comprises removing the microprobe (or microprobes) 1302 from the tissue, and disposing of the microprobe 1302 using an acceptable medical waste disposal technique.",
