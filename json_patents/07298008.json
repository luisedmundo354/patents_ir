The use of silicon control rectifiers (SCRs) to protect CMOS technologies built with bulk silicon substrates is known in the industry. However, current SCR-based ESD protection devices suffer from high junction capacitance and current crowding making them unsuitable for CMOS technologies built with SOI substrates.

Connections to I/O 195, circuit(s) 200, VDD and ground are by wires or metal contact studs (not shown) contacting first P-type region 165, and N-type region 180 (which is physically touching and electrically connected to N-well region 135) and first N-type region 175 respectfully. A metal silicide layer as described supra (not shown) may be formed on the top surfaces of first P-type region 165, N-well region 135 and first N-type region 175 to ensure a low resistance contact (also known as an ohmic contact). Also resistor R1 is seen to be the internal resistance of first N-type region 175 and resistor R2 is seen to be the internal resistance of N-well 135.",
        "Gates 145 and 150 are not functional elements of SCR 185. In one example, gates 145 and 150 are floating. In another example gates 145 and 150 are connected to ground. With gate 145 and 150 grounded, there will be some current leakage between N-well region 135 and first N-type region 175.",
        "Charge dissipation current flow in SCR 185 is from first P-type region 165 (the anode of the SCR) through first P-well region 110A, N-well region 135, second P-well region 110B to first N-type region 175 along a current path 205. Current path 205 is a single straight line current path in a first horizontal direction defined by line 7B-7B and all planes parallel to a plane defined by the top surface of silicon layer 115. Current flow in SCR 185 is only in a single horizontal direction as opposed to prior art SCR devices where the current must turn about 90\u00b0 from emitter 1 to the base/collectors and another 90\u00b0 from the base/collectors to emitter 2. Thus, in the prior art devices, charge dissipation current is flowing in two different horizontal directions. The change in horizontal direction of current flow in prior art SCRs cause current crowding, limiting the amount of charge that can be dissipated.",
        "The speed of turn on of SCR 185 is controlled by distance L (in the first horizontal direction between PN junction 137 and PN junction 138: the larger the value of L, the slower the turn on of SCR 185; the smaller the value of L, the faster the turn on of SCR 185. In one example L is between about 100 and 250 nm. W is the width (in the second horizontal direction) of N-well region 135 and along with the depth D (in a vertical direction) and the doping concentration of the N-well region controls the amount of current SCR 185 can carry. W, L and D are mutually orthogonal.",
        "FIG. 8 is a simulated lateral profile of an SCR ESD protection device according to the embodiments of the present invention. The term lateral direction refers to a direction parallel to the first horizontal direction (and not to the second horizontal direction) as described supra. A peak concentration is a maximum doping concentration in a given region. A net doping concentration is the difference between the doping concentrations of a first dopant type and a second and opposite dopant type, the concentration of the first dopant type being greater than the concentration of the second dopant type. Thus, a net peak doping concentration is the maximum difference between the doping concentration of a first dopant type less the doping concentration of a second dopant type, the concentration of the first dopant type being greater than the concentration of the second dopant type. The concentration of the second dopant type may be zero. The terms doped P-type or doped N-type should be understood to mean net doping. For example, a region having both N- and P-type dopants, with a higher concentration of N-type dopant than P-type dopant would be considered to be doped N-type and vice versa.",
        "In FIG. 8, curve 210 represents an approximate and exemplary lateral doping profile for SCR 185 of FIG. 7A. Point 215 marks the PN junction between the portions of SCR 185 formed from P-type region 165 and first P-well region 110A (see FIG. 7A) and N-well region 135 (see FIG. 7A). Point 220 marks the PN junction between the portions of SCR 185 formed from N-well region 135 (see FIG. 7A) and P-well region 110B (see FIG. 7A). Point 225 marks the PN junction between the portions of SCR 185 formed from P-well region 110B (see FIG. 7A) and N-type region 175 (see FIG. 7A).",
        "In one example, the peak doping concentrations of P-type region 165 and N-type regions 175 are advantageously each greater than a peak doping concentration of N-well region 135 and a peak doping concentration of P-well region 110B. In one example, the peak doping concentration of P-well region 110B is advantageously greater than the peak doping concentration of N-well region 135. In one, example, the peak doping concentrations of P-type region 165 and N-type regions 175 are advantageously each at least two orders of magnitude greater than the peak doping concentrations of both said P-well region 110B and said N-well region 135.",
        "Thus, the embodiments of the present invention provides an SCR device for ESD protection in integrated circuits fabricated on silicon-on-insulator SOI substrates.",
