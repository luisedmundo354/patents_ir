        "This application claims priority to PCT Application No. PCT/FR02/02848 filed Aug. 9, 2002 and French Application No. 0111549 filed Sep. 6, 2001.",
        "The present invention relates to a high-bit-rate radio receiver method and system for receiving signals in a radio system utilizing the code division multiple access (CDMA) technique.",
        "Information is transmitted in mobile telephone systems using a multiple access technique. Some systems use frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA), users of the network being distinguished from each other by the respective frequency used and by the information to be transmitted being delivered in time slots assigned to each user. In systems based on code division multiple access (CDMA), users communicate with each other using the same radio frequency band. To be able to distinguish users from one another, each is assigned a respective spreading code for the whole duration of a connection, the code being used to spread the spectrum of the signal to be transmitted in base band. To reconstitute the information transmitted, the receivers must use the same code to effect the operation that is the converse of the spreading operation. Compared to other multiple access methods, this technique has the advantage of being more flexible in terms of access and bit rate, which can be varied by altering the spreading factor.",
        "In radio transmission, the form of the medium between the sender and the receiver of a radio signal interferes with transmission and leads to propagation along multiple paths caused by reflections at different points along the radio channel, especially in an urban environment. As a result, components of the same signal reach the receiver with different powers and different time delays.",
        "CDMA receiver systems use a rake receiver to reconstitute the transmitted signal from the components received over different propagation paths. These receivers are based on reconstituting a delay profile or radio channel equivalent model. To this end, a sequence of pilot symbols known to the receivers is transmitted together with the information, and on the basis of this prior knowledge the receivers perform an estimation (an impulse response representing all the paths of the radio channel) of the radio channel over which the received signal was transmitted. A matched filter is shifted over the received signal, for example by half a spreading code unit, while the received power is measured. This technique is used to construct an impulse response graph giving information on the power and the time delays caused by multipath propagation of the components of the signal received over a given radio channel.",
        "Although the CDMA technique would seem to be very suitable for real time low-bit-rate services, it appears to be unsuitable for high-bit-rate packet services because the performance of the rake receiver is based on cross-correlation and autocorrelation properties of the spreading sequences, which improves as the length of the spreading sequence, and thus of the spreading factor, is increased. Now, the higher the bit rate, the lower the spreading factor. The spreading sequence becomes shorter and the cross-correlation and autocorrelation properties of the spreading sequences are therefore degraded, leading to interference between symbols of the same transmitted signal. As a result of this, the performance of the rake receiver is seriously degraded for spreading factors less than 8, especially if the type of modulation used has a large number of states.",
        "A study of the degraded performance of rake receivers caused by intersymbol interference has shown that it is necessary to use an equalization technique if the spreading factor is less than 16 (see [1] \u201cOn the rake receiver performance\u201d H. Boujemaa, M. Siala, VTC 2000 Fall, Boston, USA).",
        "Thus rake receivers on their own are found to be a very unsuitable response to the requirements of high-bit-rate mobile telephony.",
        "At present it is virtually impossible to use optimum detection and encoding techniques, as this leads to very high calculation complexity, especially if the transmission channels have an impulse response that is too long, as is the case in an urban environment.",
        "Various suboptimal detection and decoding methods are used in the time division multiple access (TDMA) technique.",
        "For example, the technique using a linear minimum mean square error equalizer (LMMSE) reduces not only intersymbol interference but also interuser interference. For more, details, see the documents:\n\n    \n    \n        [2] \u201cLinear receivers for the DS-CDMA downlink exploiting orthogonality of spreading sequences\u201d by I. Ghauri and D. T. M. Slock, in Proc. 32nd Asilomar Conf. on Signals, Systems and Comp., Asilomar, Calif., Nov. 1-4 1998, and\n        [3] \u201cInterference Suppression in CDMA Downlink through Adaptive Channel Equalization\u201d, by M. Heikkil\u00e4, P. Komulainen, and J. Lilleberg, in VTC 99 Fall, Tokyo, Japan.",
        "Note that interuser interference on downlinks is caused by multipath propagation in the channels, given that the spreading sequences of different users are mutually orthogonal. That solution proves to be very effective at reducing interuser interference, compared to rake receivers. However, because of the linear characteristics of the LMMSE equalizer, that solution does not significantly reduce intersymbol interference.",
        "It has also been proposed to provide a maximum likelihood sequence estimation equalizer (MLSE) at the output of a rake receiver. For more details of that technique see for example the document [4] \u201cJoint multipath combining and MLSE equalization (rake-MLSE Receiver) for WCDMA systems\u201d by S. Tantikovit, and A. U. H. Sheikh, in VTC 2000 Spring, Tokyo, Japan.",
        "That solution is optimized from the sequence-detection point of view, and close to the optimum solution in terms of detecting errors in the symbols transmitted. However, the complexity of that solution increases exponentially with the spreading of the time delays in the same channel and with the size of the modulation constellation employed. Thus it cannot be applied to all UMTS services. Furthermore, that solution does not take into account the degraded performance caused by incorrect channel estimation and channel coding. Furthermore, it does not offer a flexible or weighted output algorithm.",
        "The prior art delayed decision feedback sequence estimation (DDFSE) technique reduces the complexity of the states of the trellis by using the \u201cper survivor\u201d processing technique. For more details of that technique, see for example the document [5] \u201cDelayed Decision-Feedback Sequence Estimation\u201d by A. Duel-Hallen and C. Heegard, in IEEE Transactions on Communications, Vol. 37, pp. 428-436, May 1989.",
        "In TDMA systems, that technique has the drawback of being sensitive to error propagation, which necessitates prefiltering. That technique appears to be inapplicable to CDMA systems since the channel equivalent model at the rake receiver output varies on each symbol transmitted, as it depends on the spreading code, which changes on each symbol.",
        "An iterative detection and decoding method designed for the TDMA technique and known as \u201cturbo-detection\u201d is described in the paper [6] \u201cIterative Correction of Intersequential Interference: Turbo-equalization\u201d by C. Douillard, M. Jezequel, C. Berrou, A. Picart, P. Didier and A. Glavieux, published in European Transactions on Telecommunications, Vol. 6, p. 507 to 511, September 1995. In that detection and decoding technique, an MLSE equalizer with weighted inputs and outputs (SISO MLSE) is used, and the decoding process is of the Viterbi type, also with weighted inputs and outputs (SOVA). That process is described in a paper [7] entitled \u201cA low Complexity Soft Output Viterbi Decoder Architecture\u201d, ICC '93 p. 733 to 740, Geneva, Switzerland, May 1993.",
        "The above detection and decoding technique has been further developed, yielding optimized maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) detectors. For more details of those detectors, see the following papers:\n\n    \n    \n        [8] \u201cOptimal Decoding of Linear Codes for Minimizing Symbol Error Rate\u201d published by L. R. Bahl, J. Cocke, F. Jelinek and J. Raviv in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol. IT-20, p. 284-287, March 1994; and\n        [9] \u201cIterative Equalization and Decoding in Mobile Communications Systems\u201d, published by G. Baush, H. Khorram and J. Hagenauer in Proc. EPMCC '97, p. 307-312, Bonn, Germany, September 1997.",
        "However, the above solution has not been transposed to CDMA systems, and further introduces undue complexity of the receiver, of the order of ML, where M is the number of points of the modulation constellation and L is the number of echoes in the propagation channel taken into account. Moreover, it does not address the channel estimation problem.",
        "Finally, the paper [10] \u201cTurbo-Equalization over Frequency Selective Channel\u201d\n\n    \n    \n        International Symposium on Turbo-Codes, Brest, France, September 1997, proposes an iterative symbol detection and channel decoding technique, known as \u201cturbo-equalization\u201d and significantly different from the turbo-detection technique mentioned above, and which presupposes a noisy estimation of the transmission channel. However, compared to the turbo-detection technique, the turbo-equalization technique degrades performance in a way that is strongly dependant on the equalization technique employed for the first iteration. On that subject, see the paper [11] \u201cJoint Equalization and Decoding: Why Choose the Iterative Solution?\u201d by A. Roumy, I. Figalkow and D. Pirez, in IEEE VTC '1999 Fall, Amsterdam, Netherlands, September 1999.",
        "That technique cannot be transposed to CDMA systems since it is based on filtering techniques that cannot be applied if the channel varies independently from one transmitted symbol to another.",
        "An object of the present invention is to solve these problems in order to propose a reception method and a receiver structure that are relatively simple, that have close to optimum performance, and that use high order modulation combined with a low spreading factor. This object is achieved by providing a method of receiving a signal transmitted on a multipath transmission channel using a spread spectrum technique with a low spreading factor, said signal being transmitted in the form of sequences of coded binary symbols comprising both predefined pilot symbols and data symbols multiplied by a spreading sequence, said method including a step of determining a channel estimate using received predefined pilot symbols.",
        "It applies in particular, although not exclusively, to high-bit-rate (at least 2 megabits per second (Mbit/s)) mobile telephone systems such as the European Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) designed to offer a wide range of services having different bit rates and spreading factors. The services include a high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) mode of transmission to mobile terminals that is characterized by dispensing with closed loop power control and link adaptation utilizing variable constellation modulation (QPSK, MAQ16, MAQ64) and a low spreading factor.",
        "According to the invention, the method comprises the steps of:\n\n    \n    \n        reconstituting the transmitted signal using the channel estimate on the basis of received signals that were transmitted over the multiple paths of the transmission channel,\n        determining from the channel estimate an equivalent model of the channel as seen from the reconstituted signal,\n        reducing intersymbol interference in the reconstituted transmitted signal resulting from a low spreading factor, using the channel equivalent model and a DDFSE detector based on a trellis with a reduced number of states and delivering at its output estimated values of the received coded symbols,\n        de-interleaving the coded symbols, and\n        decoding the estimated values of the de-interleaved coded symbols to reconstitute the transmitted data symbols.",
        "The estimated values of the coded symbols received obtained after interference reduction and after decoding are advantageously weighted or flexible values.",
        "According to a feature of the invention, the steps of reducing intersymbol interference and of decoding are included in an iterative process wherein the de-interleaved coded symbols obtained in an iteration n are re-estimated during decoding as a function of the data symbols obtained after decoding and error correction, the difference between the re-estimated coded symbols obtained in the same iteration and the de-interleaved coded symbols obtained in the next iteration n+1 is re-interleaved and then applied to the input of the DDFSE detector and subtracted from the coded symbols obtained in the iteration n+1 at the output of the DDFSE detector.",
        "The channel estimate is advantageously improved using the least squares (LS) method.",
        "The channel estimate is preferably improved using the minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithm.",
        "According to another feature of the invention, the channel is estimated in an iterative process wherein the coded and de-interleaved symbols obtained in an iteration n are re-estimated during decoding, as a function of the data symbols obtained after decoding and error correction, the re-estimated coded symbols being interleaved, a channel estimate being obtained on the basis of the re-estimated and interleaved coded symbols, an equivalent channel model being determined from the channel estimate, and the channel estimate and the channel equivalent model determined in an iteration n being respectively used to reconstitute the transmitted signal and to reduce intersymbol interference in the next iteration n+1.",
        "The invention also provides a system for receiving a signal transmitted on a multipath transmission channel using a spread spectrum technique and a low spreading factor, said signal being transmitted in the form of a sequence of coded binary symbols comprising predefined pilot symbols and data symbols and multiplied by a spreading sequence, said system comprising a rake receiver for reconstituting the transmitted signal using a channel estimate on the basis of the signals received and transmitted by the multiple paths of the transmission channel and channel estimation means for estimating the channel on the basis of the pilot symbols received, to deliver a transmission channel estimate to the rake receiver.",

        "In FIG. 2, the receiver of the invention comprises a rake receiver 11 that utilizes a channel estimate supplied by a channel estimator 10 and is followed by an intersymbol interference reduction device 12 to which an equivalent model 16 of the transmission channel is fed. The output of the interference reduction device 12 is connected to a decoder 15 via a de-interleaver 14 carrying out the operation that is the converse of the interleaving operation 3. Moreover, the channel estimate supplied by the estimator 10 is applied to the channel model 16 to determine a channel equivalent model.",
        "According to the invention, the intersymbol interference reduction device 12 is of the delayed decision feedback sequence estimation (DDFSE) type with weighted input and output, i.e. takes the form of a logarithm ln[p(1)/p(0)] of the ratio of probabilities p(1) and p(0) that the signal level is respectively logic level 1 and logic level 0. Similarly, the decoder 15 also has weighted inputs and outputs.",

Because of the reduction of the trellis, the DDFSE device 12 evaluates the quantity {\u2212lnp(a1\u03c4,y1\u03c4)} in a suboptimal manner on the basis of the \u201cper survivor\u201d PSP algorithm that consists in selecting only one survivor per node. For a given subtrellis T(S,B) and a particular metric branch, the expression \u03bcn\u21c4(b) denotes the metric cost of the best path beginning at the substate 0 at the depth 0 and terminating at the substate 0 at the depth \u03c4 (taking account of the tailing symbols of the sequence), and passing through the branch b\u03b5Bn of the section n. It is also assumed that each branch b\u03b5Bn contains three fields: a start substate field b\u2212\u03b5Sn\u22121, an arrival substate field b+\u03b5Sn and a field labeled b\u2207={b1\u2207, . . . , bq\u2207}, modeling a bit label input symbol for the intersymbol interference convolutional code of level 1 varying as a function of time at the instant n.

The output of the de-interleaver 14 is connected to an input receiving the logarithm of the intrinsic probability ratio of the coded bits from the decoder 15 which supplies at a first output the logarithm of a posteriori probability ratios on the data bits transmitted and at a second output the logarithm of the a posteriori probability ratio on the coded bits that is determined by an operation that is the converse of the decoding applied to the decoded data bits after error correction. The second output of the decoder 15 is looped via a comparator 18 and an interleaver 17 to the negative input of the comparator 13 and to an input of the DDFSE device 12. The output of the de-interleaver 14 is also fed to the negative input of the comparator 18.",

        "The sequence of extrinsic probability ratio logarithms applying to the coded bits at the output of the decoder 15 is re-interleaved by the interleaver 17 and returned to the decoder 15 after the next detection of N sequences of a priori probability ratio logarithms applying to the symbol bits. By repeating this process a certain number of times, a great increase in the signal-to-noise ratio is achieved in relation to the data bits of the received sequences.",
        "Because of its very regular Viterbi structure, and its good performance given its moderate complexity, the DDFSE detector of the device 12 appears to be perfectly suitable for turbo-detection as effected in the receiver shown in FIG. 3.",
        "For the first iteration, the system shown in FIG. 3 operates in exactly the same way as described with reference to FIG. 2. On the second and subsequent iterations, equation (31) giving the branch metric \u03ben(b) used by the DDFSE device 12 has an additional term:",

        "It must be emphasized that, if \u03bdr=2L\u2032, the algorithm executed by the DDFSE device 12 becomes formally equivalent to a Min-Log-BCJR algorithm applied to the whole of the channel trellis. If the processing were applied to only a reduced state trellis, the estimated sequences obtained from the history of the paths and involved in the derivatives of the branch metrics would degrade performance because of a possible error propagation effect. Nevertheless, it appears that the equivalent channels at the output of the rake receiver 11 do not introduce any significant error propagation into the structure of the DDFSE reduction device 12. As a result, the choice \u03bdr=1 is sufficient in most cases.",
        "The performance of conventional channel estimation obtained by correlation and average calculation processing applied to a sequence of pilot symbols is degraded with low spreading values because of intersymbol interference.",
        "To illustrate this, FIG. 6 shows curves of bit error rate as a function of signal-to-noise ratio at the output of the decoder 15 obtained with different solutions. In this figure, the curve C6 corresponds to the ideal situation. The curve C7, which corresponds to the situation in which a conventional channel estimation is used, shows that this solution offers relatively poor performance, relatively far removed from the ideal.",
        "The present invention proposes to improve the quality of channel estimate in the systems shown in FIGS. 2 to 4 by using the known structure of the intersymbol interference. To this end, the channel estimator 10 shown in FIG. 7 is used. This channel estimator comprises a conventional channel estimator 30 whose output is connected to a channel estimate corrector 31 using the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) method or the least squares (LS) method, delivering a channel estimate that is used by the device 12 and by the channel modeling device 16.",

As is apparent in FIG. 6, the simulations show that a conventional channel estimate, based only on correlation with pilot symbols, leads to poor performance with a low spreading factor (curve C7). The structure of the intersymbol interference must be taken into account, which is possible using the MMSE and LS methods. The performance achieved using the MMSE method is shown by the curve C9 in FIG. 6, which indicates a significant improvement over conventional methods.",

The loop comprises an interleaver 19 connected to the output of the decoder 15 and whose output is connected via a threshold comparator 20 to an iterative channel estimation device 21. The comparator 20 transforms the weighted or flexible output of the decoder 15 into a \u201chard\u201d output, i.e. one that is equal to 0 or to 1, depending on whether the weighted value is greater than a predetermined threshold or not.",

The estimated codes coming from the channel decoder 15 are then used by the device 21 to re-estimate the channel, in order to reduce the channel estimation noise for the next iteration, the channel estimates determined in this way being applied to the modeling device 16 (switches 23, 24 respectively open and closed).",

These two curves show that this method improves performance and, in the case of channel estimation with MMSE correction, approximates the ideal situation shown by the curve C6."
