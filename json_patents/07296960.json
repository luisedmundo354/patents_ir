        "The present invention relates generally to a coupling system, including a coupling device and an engagement device for mating attachment of a seating device to a securing or lifting device to allow the seating device to be secured and/or lifted relative to transportation and/or architectural movement needs. More particularly, the present invention relates to a coupling device fixedly secured to, or integrally embodied in, the frame of a wheelchair or other seating device to allow the wheelchair or seating device, while occupied, to be secured in position and/or lifted or lowered in elevation.",
        "It has been a consistent challenge for wheelchair users, mobility device users, and those that assist them, to secure their wheelchairs and/or mobility devices in a stable position in a moving vehicle, while the user is seated therein. Current known systems utilize a strap or latch system that secures the wheel, axle, and/or frame of the wheelchair within a vehicle through the use of strap and tie down methods. While these systems and methods are universal in their ability to accommodate a wide range of differing wheelchair designs, they are typically cumbersome and time consuming for users and their assistance personnel. Moreover, these systems typically cannot be performed alone by a person confined to or otherwise seated within a wheelchair or mobility device and therefore require the assistance of another person. This is because a person seated in the wheelchair or mobility device typically cannot reach the strap and tie down systems.",
        "Systems that clamp the wheels of a wheelchair for securing thereof have been developed. These systems are designed to engage the wheels automatically or upon activation. However, restraint of a wheelchair by the wheels does not provide a satisfactorily rigid connection of the wheelchair seat or seating device to a transportation vehicle, particularly in the event of rough terrain or an accident. Further, these wheel clamp systems also take up considerable space within the transportation vehicle. Therefore, it would be advantageous to provide a universal system for coupling and effectuating elevation changes of a seating device and/or wheelchair that includes a simple rigid connection for securing the wheelchair and/or seating device in a stationary position. In the case of a public transportation bus, for instance, it is known that present developments for wheelchair clamping devices addressing the deficiencies of tie down systems take up a significant amount of space, thereby decreasing the effective area, where the predominant use is not related to those of disability or limited mobility. It would be desirable to provide a system that also overcomes this disadvantage.",
        "Moreover, it is also a known challenge for wheelchair users, mobility device users, and those that assist them, to lift their wheelchair and/or other mobility device from the ground up into a vehicle or other mode of transportation, or to negotiate level changes within an architectural structure, such as a building. As is known, a large amount of effort and/or mechanical assistance is required to assist or lift a person from ground level to a driving or riding position in a vehicle. This is true for a person that has some physical impairment that limits their ability to climb into a vehicle, such as for example, a person with a walker or a cane. This is equally true for those that are not physically able to climb into a vehicle, including those that require a wheelchair. Moreover, significant effort and/or mechanical assistance is also required to lift or lower a person of physical disability from one elevation to another within any architectural building.",
        "Most current systems that provide assistance in elevating a person in a wheelchair or seating device to a driving or riding position, such as is required for entry into a vehicle, require that the wheelchair or seating device be positioned on a platform or similar structure, which is then lifted with the person seated thereon, to raise them to the level of the vehicle. These platform type systems typically require a large amount of space and are therefore costly and disadvantageous. Further, after the wheelchair or seating device has been lifted, the wheelchair or seating device must further be moved into position and then secured within the vehicle. This typically requires that the wheelchair or seating device be latched in position through tying down of the wheel or the axle, as discussed above. Only after the wheelchair or seating device has been secured, can the vehicle be operated safely for the occupant of the wheelchair or seating device.",
        "Several current lifting systems are available that can transfer a person from a position on ground into a vehicle. These lifting systems include a lifting seat that is an integral part of the lifting system. These systems thus require the physical transfer of the person from their wheelchair or seating device into the lifting chair. On ce the person is located in the lifting seat, the seat is lifted and rotated by the lifting system to a secure position within the transportation mode. These systems also require the step of storing the now unused wheelchair or seating device in the vehicle by an aiding attendant before vehicle operation, such that they can be used again by the person when unloaded from the lifting seat. This is thus not a system that can readily be used independently by the user.",
        "It would therefore be advantageous to provide a coupling system that would place a lifting system in communication with a wheelchair and enable both the lifting and securing steps of the wheelchair to easily allow persons that require the use of a wheelchair to enter and exit the vehicle as compared to current systems. In the case of an able, or limited mobility person, it would also be advantageous to provide a coupling system for use with a seating element instead of a wheelchair that secures and lifts the seating element. At present, there are no known systems that can accommodate different seating configurations and thus allow for adaptation to a person's changing mobility capabilities or to the abilities of another user.",
        "There presently exists no universal rapidly deployable rigid system for use in securing and/or effectuating elevation changes of seating devices or wheelchairs. It would therefore be desirable to provide a universal wheelchair coupling device that can be utilized with different attachment devices and lifting structures employed by different vehicles and/or architectural applications. Current universal lift platform devices for rapidly deploying and lifting wheelchairs and/or other seating devices require significant space and are not efficient for use in vehicles, boats, bus, and architectural settings where the predominant use is not related to those of disability or limited mobility. It would thus be desirable to provide a coupling device that allows for universal attachment to more compact systems capable of use with a wider variety of vehicles and also requiring less devoted space.",
        "It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a coupling system that allows a wheelchair and/or other mobility seating device to be readily lifted by a mechanical apparatus into a vehicle and retained in a secure position within the vehicle.",
        "It is another object of the present invention to provide a universal coupling system that allows a wheelchair and/or other seating device to be secured and lifted by a mechanical apparatus such that it remains secured during the lifting operation with respect to a variety of different modes of transportation, including automobiles, buses, boats, stairs, personal mobility vehicles, and other similar devices and structures.",
        "It is a further object of the present invention to provide a universal coupling system that is intended to communicate with a lift mechanism such that its configuration takes up significantly less space than prior lift mechanisms.",
        "It is a still another object of the present invention to provide a coupling system that includes a securing feature that allows a wheelchair to be lifted from ground into a vehicle and secured within the vehicle without the need to secure the wheel of the wheelchair or the frame secondarily.",
        "It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a coupling system that can be utilized with various seating modules, devices and personal platforms, including wheelchairs and power wheelchairs.",
        "It is a related object of the present invention to provide a coupling system that allows for relatively efficient attachment of a wheelchair or other seating device to a lift mechanism as compared to prior attachment mechanisms.",
        "It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a coupling system that readily facilitates unattachment of the mating engagement device incorporated in the coupling system as the wheelchair or seating device is in the final stage of lowering such that the seating device or wheelchair can readily move away from the system or vehicle when lowered to exit height. In the case of unattachment of a seating module, the removal of the seat module is effected easily for removal thereof and ready accommodation of another seating module, device, or personal platform, including wheelchairs and power wheelchairs.",
        "It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a coupling system having an electrical signal coupling component that allows the wheelchair user's controls to mate to the lift mechanism and the vehicle controls for subsequent control of the lift mechanism and the vehicle with the user's wheelchair controls.",
        "In accordance with that above and the other objects of the present invention, a universal coupling system is provided. The universal coupling system includes a coupling device that is intended to be secured to or formed integrally with the frame of a chair device, such as a comfort chair unit or a wheelchair. The coupling device includes at least one attachment structure formed thereon for mating with a corresponding engagement device formed on an associated lift mechanism or a location securing device utilizing the coupling system's universal attachment standards. In the case of utilization with a lifting mechanism, the coupling device is intended to mate the structure on the chair device with the corresponding engagement device on the lift mechanism and locationally secure the chair device in space for lifting. Thereafter, the chair device is raised to an elevated position while the chair device is occupied. The coupling system is configured such that complete stability of the chair device relative to the lift mechanism is maintained during the lifting operation. The coupling device preferably includes one or more aligning devices to facilitate tolerance of the coupling process or chair device misalignment during the coupling process. It will be understood that the effective elements of the coupling device, the engagement device, and the aligning devices may be located either on the engagement device or the coupling device.",

        "Referring now to FIG. 1, which illustrates a preferred coupling device 10, which is part of a coupling system 5 in accordance with the present invention. The coupling device 10 is preferably secured to the chair frame of a wheelchair 12. More preferably, the coupling device 10 is secured to the seat back 14 of the chair frame. It will be understood that the coupling device 10 may alternatively be secured to the seat bottom 18 of the chair frame. The coupling device 10 may be attached on a combination of the seat back 14 and the seat bottom 18 or a variety of other locations on the wheelchair 12 or combination thereof. However, the coupling device 10 is attached to the wheelchair 12 independently of the wheels. In other words, the coupling device 10 is secured to the wheelchair 12, such that it effects a rigid connection and does not interfere with any normal function of the wheelchair 12.",
        "The coupling device 10 is preferably attached to the chair frame by welding. However, the coupling device 10 may alternatively be attached to the wheelchair 12 by any known attachment or securing mechanism. While the coupling device 10 is preferably secured to the wheelchair 12, it may alternatively be integrally formed with the wheelchair 12, such as in the seat back structure 14 or the seat bottom structure 18 or a combination thereof. Moreover, while the coupling device 10 is preferably shown and described for use with a wheelchair 12, it is intended, and will be understood that the coupling device 10 may be secured to, or integral with and utilized by a power wheelchair, a mobility device or other seating structure.",
        "The coupling device 10 is preferably comprised of an upper plate 20, which is secured to the seat back 14, and a lower plate 22, which is also preferably secured to the seat back 14. The upper plate 20 and the lower plate 22 are preferably comprised of a metal material, however, it will be understood that the plates 20, 22 may instead be formed of a plastic material, such as through known injection or compression molding processes. Similarly, the plates 20, 22 and the chair may be formed in a single process. Alternatively, the plates 20, 22 may be formed from a variety of other suitable materials. While the plates 20, 22 are illustrated as two separate pieces, it will be appreciated that they may be formed as a single plate or more than two. Further, while the plates 20, 22 are shown attached to the seat back 14, it will be understood that they can be attached, either entirely or partially, to other portions of the wheelchair 12.",
        "The upper plate 20 preferably has a plurality of through holes 24 which allow attachment to secure various seat back cushions to the seat back 14. The upper plate 20 also preferably includes a hook latch 26 that is integrally formed with one or more load distributing structural elements or shapes 28 that provide support integrity to the hook latch 26. The hook latch 26 and the supporting elements 28 are each also integrally formed with the upper plate 20. The upper plate 20 also preferably includes a channel 30 formed in either side of the upper plate 20 that allows the upper plate 20 to be welded to each of the arm handles 32 of the wheelchair 12.",
        "The lower plate 22 preferably also has a plurality of through holes 34, which allow attachment to secure various seat back cushions to the seat back 14 of the wheelchair 12. The lower plate 22 also includes at least one guide pin 36, which protrudes generally outwardly therefrom, and a clamp bar 38. The lower plate 22 also includes an electrical signal and/or power connector component 40. The electrical power signal and/o r power connector component 40 is in communication with the various controls that are present on the wheelchair, seating device or powerchair 12, as will be understood by one of skill in the art.",
        "FIG. 2A illustrates the preferred coupling system 5, which embodies the mating engagement of the coupling device 10 to an engagement device 50. As shown, the engagement device 50 is preferably secured to an associated lift mechanism 52 and includes a latch 54, which is intended to receive and lock the clamp bar 38 therein. The latch 54 secures the clamp bar 38 when in an engaged position to secure the wheelchair 12 to the lift mechanism 52. The latch 54 thus locks the clamp bar 38 when the lift mechanism 52 is seated in a desired operating position within the vehicle 110. The latch 54 is in communication with a device 55 that will release the clamp bar 38 when the lift mechanism 52 is being activated to allow movement of the attached chair in a path that is determined by the lift mechanism, such as for lowering to a ground engaging position for ready uncoupling of the chair 12. It is understood that latch 54 could be located on the engagement device 50, if engagement device 50 is provided with full mechanical restraint of motion to effectuate securing of the wheelchair 12.",
        "The engagement device 50 also preferably includes an electrical signal and/or power receptor device 56, which is intended to mate with the electrical signal and/or power connector component 40, such that the controls used to operate the wheelchair 12 can be utilized by the user to operate the lift mechanism 52 and/or the vehicle into which the wheelchair 12 is being lifted. The engagement device 50 also includes a supporting rod 58, that is intended to engage the hook latch 26, and at least one channel 60 that is intended to receive a respective guide pin or pins 36 therein, as is discussed in more detail below. The connection of the wheelchair controls to the lift mechanism 52 can be accomplished in a variety of other ways, including mechanical, electrical, infrared, or other known communication methods.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2A, the electrical signal power connector device 56 remains in the vehicle 110 and mates with the connector component 40 when the wheelchair 12 is located in the vehicle. However, as shown in FIG. 2B, the electrical signal and/or power connector device 56, which is shown as an infrared connector may also be located on the lift mechanism 52. Thus, the electrical signal and/or power connector component 40 may thus be located on the lift mechanism 52 or may remain fixed within the interior of the vehicle.",
        "The mating of the coupling device 10 with the engagement device 50 allows the wheelchair 12 to be secured to the lift mechanism 52 and maintained in a secure position during the lifting process. The coupling system 5, through the features of the coupling device 10 and the engagement device 50, including the guide pin or pins 36 and the tapered path of the hook latch 26 provide centering capability.

The sprocket actuator 184 pushes the lever portion 182, which causes the assembly 172 to rotate with respect to the axle 144. The movement of the assembly 172 causes the rotating cam sprockets 170 to rotate which pulls or releases the chain 176 and thereby turns the lift sprockets 162. The rotation of the lift sprockets 162 allows the inclination of the face plate portion 128 to be changed with respect to the main lift arm portion 126. In other words, the angle of the lift plate 118 is varied to effectuate tilting of the coupled seating device, as is discussed in more detail below.

However, as discussed in detail below, the lift arm 114 can be utilized for a variety of purposes and incorporated into a variety of different situations. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 10 through 12, the lift arm 114 is intended to lift an individual seated on a wheelchair 12 from a position on the ground to a position secured in the vehicle 110. The engagement of the lift arm 114 with the wheelchair 12 is by mating of the engagement device 64 with the coupling device 10, which is described in detail above. While the present invention is preferably intended for engagement with a wheelchair 12, it will be understood that the lift mechanism 52 can also engage a power wheelchair, a seating module, such as illustrated in FIG. 3 or a variety of other seating devices, as will be understood by one of skill in the art.",

In the fully extended position, the face plate portion 128 of the engagement device 64 mates with the coupling device 10 on the wheelchair 12. In order to effectuate engagement, the operator of the wheelchair can back the wheelchair 12 rearwardly until the coupling device 10 engages the engagement device 64 and a mating engagement is achieved. Once the wheelchair 12 is contacting the face plate portion 128, the operator can, through the use of the control handle 192, activate the actuator 116 causing the electric actuators 136 to retract, which causes the lift arm 114 to move rearwardly, thereby causing engaging of the coupling components and lifting the wheelchair 12 and an occupant positioned therein. Obviously, the same engagement and lifting procedure would apply to other seating devices, including a power wheelchair and a seating module, as well as to other storage or devices to be lifted.",
        "As shown, the operator can stop the actuator 116 by releasing the appropriate button 194 on the control handle 192 to stop the movement of the wheelchair 12 at a variety of positions between the initial ground engaging position and the fully retracted position within the interior 120 (FIG. 11). For example, as shown, the operator can stop the actuator 116 to halt the movement of the lift arm 114 at an intermediary position generally designated by 114\u2032 such that the wheelchair is in the position designated by reference number 12\u2032. This allows an operator to utilize an elevated position while seated in the wheelchair 12 for a variety of reasons. For instance, the operator can raise himself to a forward eye level position with another person for talking and/or observing outdoor events. Additionally, the operator can change the angle of inclination of the wheelchair 112 by actuating the sprocket actuator 184, as discussed above, in order to tilt the face plate portion 128 to recline the wheelchair 12 or seating module.",
        "As the lift arm 114 raises the operator, the weight of the operator tensions the chains 176 that extend between the lift sprockets 162 and the rotating cam sprockets 170.

The final position of the lift arm 114 in the fully retracted position in the mobility vehicle 110 with the coupling system 5 attached thereto, is shown in FIG. 10. Once in the vehicle 110, the coupling system 5 completes the securing of the wheelchair 12, by means of engaging latch 54. It is foreseen that other mechanical means, including telescoping boom arm, sliding lift rails and swing booms or any combination of such can be utilized in conjunction with the coupling system 5 to accomplish the lifting of the wheelchair 12 and its positioning within the vehicle 110 as well as to secure the wheelchair 12 in an operating position to drive the vehicle 110, as are described in more detail below.",

The lift arm 234 is also in communication with a pair of rotary actuators 236 that are secured to the structure of the vehicle 110 and when actuated, provide further lifting, lowering and extended location of the face plate 232 and thus the attached seating device. In this embodiment, the wheelchair 12 or other device is backed into the open front 122 of the vehicle 110 and into engagement with the engagement device 64. The wheelchair 12 or other device can then be lifted to a driving position within the vehicle through the use of the wheelchair controls or other controls, as will be understood by one of skill in the art.",
        "Rotary actuators 236 can further be utilized for positioning the wheelchair 12 or other seating device forwardly and elevated for requirements of the operator for reaching, transfer and visibility needs. The actuators 236, as will be understood, control the lifting of the lift arm 234. The lift arm 234 can be controlled to stop its motion anywhere between a ground engaging position and a fully elevated position.

Moreover, the lift arm 234 also preferably utilizes its telescopically or slideably disposed movement. In other words, the lift arm 234 has an outer stationary portion 238 and an inner reciprocal portion 240. Upon actuation, the inner reciprocal portion 240 slides outwardly with respect to the outer stationary portion 238 to allow the wheelchair 12 or other seating device to be further extended from the vehicle 110.",

Thus, as the lift arm 246 is lowered, the face plate 256 rotates about an axis 257, such that the engagement device 64 is aligned to mate with the coupling device 62. Moreover, the lift arm 246 may also have telescopic capabilities allowing the arm to extend outwardly as desired. The lift arm 246 is preferably driven by an electric rotary actuator device 258 which is in communication with an electric rotary actuator on the axis 257, such that the face plate 256 rotatably maintains a horizontal orientation of the wheelchair 12 or seating device, while being translated into or out of said vehicle.",

The occupied wheelchair 12 is then secured within the bus 244 by means of either remaining attached to the lift system, or by uncoupling and moving to another securing position in the vehicle. No modification of the wheelchair 12 is required to effectuate lifting. The reverse operation will result in lowering the wheelchair 12 from the bus 244 to a ground engaging position. It will be understood that while the preferred lift arm is a rotary arm, the lifting operation could be accomplished by a telescoping lift arm, a four bar linkage lift arm, or a slideable translation arm. Each of these alternative configurations will be understood by one of skill in the art.",
        "As will also be understood, prior to the rotation of the lift arm 246, at least a side portion 262 of the bus 244 will swing open to allow a path for the lift arm 246 to travel and an opening through which the wheelchair 12 or other seating device can enter and exit the vehicle. The opening of the side portion 262 can be controlled by the electric actuator 258 or can alternatively be controlled independently.",

The face plate 276 is secured to a lift arm 278, which is in slideable communication with and rides on the rail system 274. Once the engagement device 64 is mated with the coupling device 10, an actuator 280 causes the lift arm 278 to raise the wheelchair 12 to a height sufficient to engage the coupling system 5 and clear the stairs. The rail system 274 with motor drive 285 engaging tooth rack 286 then, based on the operator's manipulation of the lift mechanism's or of the wheelchair's controls in communication with the lift mechanism controls, moves the lift mechanism 270 and thus the wheelchair 12 up the rail system 274 to a landing 282 at the top of the stairs 272. It is understood that other mechanisms of translation on the rail system 274 are possible such as manual assist, chain, cable, screw drive and actuator systems.",
        "Once at the landing 282, the lift arm 278 rotatably pivots about an axis 284, such that it is directionally pointed forward. This rotation 284 can happen automatically once the lift mechanism 270 reaches the landing 280 or other suitable actuation point. Alternatively, the rotation can occur based on operator control. Once rotated, the operator can decouple from the lift arm 278 by lowering the actuator 280 and move away from the engagement device 64.",
        "FIG. 20 illustrates another application for the preferred coupling system 5 in accordance with the present invention. The coupling system 5 can also be utilized to raise and lower a wheelchair 12 or other seating device from a ground engaging position to an elevated position for recreational and sport purposes. For example, FIG. 20 illustrates the coupling system 5 as used with a tree stand 300, such as for hunting, which engages the ground at its bottom 302 and is secured to a tree 304 at another point by a securing mechanism 306. The tree stand 300 has an elevating mechanism 308 associated therewith. The elevating mechanism 308 has a slideable plate 310 with the engagement device 64 secured thereto. The engagement device 64 is intended to mate with a coupling device 62 secured to a wheelchair 12 or other seating device. Once an operator is secured safely in the wheelchair 12 or other seating device and the wheelchair 12 is coupled to the lift mechanism 308, the operator through the wheelchair controls or other controls can activate the lift mechanism through the elevating mechanism 308 to elevate themselves. The same applies for lowering. It is understood that the elevating mechanism 308 can utilize a variety of known methods such as a manual pulley or ratchet system, power screw system, cable and winch system, telescoping actuation, rack and pinion system as well as others. The coupling system 5 of the present invention thus has an almost unlimited number of uses.",

The pole 322 also has a latch security and release device 324 mounted thereon for effecting engagement of the system and release of engagement.",
        "In operation, once an operator has backed the wheelchair 12 up to the pole 322 such that the coupling device 62 is aligned with the engagement device 64, the operator pulls on the latch cord 326. The latch cord 326 causes the engagement device 64 to move upward on the pole 322 and into engagement with the coupling device 62 to secure the wheelchair 12 thereto. Similarly, to unsecure the wheelchair 12, the operator pulls and releases the latch cord 326 and the engagement device 64 moves downward to unhitch the wheelchair 12 thereby allowing the wheelchair 12 to wheel away. It is understood that other latching methods are possible with utilization of universal dimensional standards of the support bar 78 and the clamp bar 90 of the coupling device 62. It is further understood that a typical car door latch system could be utilized in conjunction with only one of these bars for effective securing of wheelchair 12.",
        "Advantages of the present system include the fact that the operator has the wheelchair 12 with him/her in the vehicle 110 or other device at all times and is seated therein without the need to transfer. Further, the wheelchair is also available for ready use upon deployment after reverse operation of the lift arm by lowering and unsecuring. Additionally, another advantage is that the seat is secure independent of the rigidity of the wheelchair wheels. Moreover, the system provides complete power entry and automatic latch securing by way of a simple mechanical system and that actuation of the system for exit automatically opens the securing latch to release the coupling system 5 and the lift mechanism for lowering. While not in the vehicle operating position, it is further foreseen as advantageous that the operator is capable of locating him/herself advantageously, with this mechanism, for effectively sitting forward outside the vehicle while still attached, raising operator viewing position or reach position.",
        "A primary advantage of the coupling device 10 on the wheelchair frame is the secure latching of the wheelchair, power wheelchair, or seating module to resist movement, in the case of attaching in a vehicle. This attachment further is useful for lifting mechanisms, as in the case of lifting the wheelchair, power wheelchair, or seating module and occupant securely into the vehicle or in elevating the wheelchair, power wheelchair, or seating module, in a building environment. It is foreseen that broad acceptance of the advantages of this system will lead to a standardization of the device system for all wheelchairs and power wheelchairs for common use in future vehicle mode use and building elevation needs. For example, the present universal coupling system 5 may be utilized to lift wheelchairs or other seating devices into buses, boats, agricultural equipment, up stairs and anywhere else that elevation changes may be required, but are difficult for those needing assistance.",
