        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a method and a structure for a liquid crystal panel by using one drop fill (ODF). More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for forming the liquid crystal panel to deposit the black matrix above the thin film transistor (TFT) or not to deposit the black matrix between the sealant and glass substrate, whereby avoid the sheltering effect of black matrix when executing curing processing of a sealant.",
        "2. Description of the Prior Art",
        "Materials of liquid crystal has the characteristic of flowing, hence, molecules of liquid crystal move and lead into different arrangement statuses with just a tiny force. To give an example of a most widespread familiar nematic type liquid crystal, the molecules of liquid crystal change the orientation by the effect of electric filed. Since the optic axis of liquid crystal and its molecular axis are identical, the orientation of polarizing will change according to the arrangement orientation of liquid crystal molecules when the polarized light that is irradiated from backlight module by way of polarizing film passes through liquid crystal. Furthermore, by using another polarizing film the transmittancy will varies depending on the polarization direction of polarized light. By using a distinct electric field on a distinct region of the liquid crystal to cause the distinct arrangement orientation, a liquid crystal display mainly depending on the two polarizing films and the liquid crystal within them displays distinct brightness representation of the distinct regions of the liquid crystal according to the pattern to be displayed. By using trichromatic color filters (red, blue and green (R, G, and B)) to present different colors, colorful images can be displayed on the liquid crystal displays. Because of the flowing characteristic of the liquid crystal, it is necessary to adhere to two substrates held spaced apart to form an empty cavity by using a sealant disposed in a peripheral region of them, wherein the cavity is then infused with the liquid crystal. Transistors and electrodes are deposited on the glass substrate to provide the electric field for changing the orientation of the liquid crystal. The aforementioned two polarizing films are also deposited on these two glass substrates.",
        "Most of the prior arts for injecting the liquid crystal are applied to use a vacuum insertion process and it is as follows. The two glass substrates (Liquid Crystal Display Panel; LCD Panel), being composed to form an empty cavity, are put into a vacuum chamber. The cavity of the composed glass substrates is reserved an downward opening and fastened by way of a base, wherein a shallow container with the liquid crystal is set below the opening for providing liquid crystal. Since there is vacuumed in the vacuum chamber, by way of and butting the shallow container by using a spring action means and then let in the air, the cavity between the two substrates is fully filled with liquid crystal by capillary action. Finally, seal the opening, whereby the infusing of the liquid crystal is complete.",
        "It is required a considerable longtime to complete the process for injecting the cavity with the liquid crystal. For example, if the cell gap of a 15-inch liquid crystal display panel is 3.5 um, it costs 40 hours to complete the vacuum insertion process with the liquid crystal. Moreover, the time being required to complete the process of injecting the cavity with the liquid crystal increases when the size of the liquid crystal display panel increases or the cell gap between the glass substrates decreases. Hence the process time can not be reduced, even the cost increases with the increasing of the panel size.",
        "In order to reduce the process time, a faster process for injecting the liquid crystal has been proposed, which is called one-drop fill (ODF) technique. Before proceeding the technique, a high-adhesive sealant must be smeared over the glass substrates for being the adhesive to adhere to the glass substrates and confining the liquid crystal. The technique applies a dropping apparatus to control the dropping amount. Firstly, drop an amount of liquid crystal directly on one glass substrate and then proceed the assembling with another substrates in vacuum. After assembling, execute a sealant compressing procedure and a sealant curing procedure irradiated by ultraviolet (UV) rays, the cell process is complete. When the cell gap of a 15-inch liquid crystal display is 3.5 um, the time being required for the process of one-drop fill technique is reduced to be about 1.5 hours and not dependant on the size of liquid crystal display and the cell gap. Thus one-drop fill technique has the advantages of simplifying the process and reduces time of the process.",
        "Although one-drop fill technique has the aforementioned advantages, it also suffers some problems. Because a high-adhesive sealant, being the adhesive to adhere to the glass substrates and confining the liquid crystal, must be formed on a substrate before liquid crystal is dropped onto the substrate. And then the sealant must be irradiated by ultraviolet rays to archive completely curing after assembling, wherein the black matrix on the glass substrates will shelter from ultraviolet rays to cause the problems of process complexity increasing and incompletely curing in the process for curing. Besides, the liquid crystal contacts with the uncured sealant while it is dropped onto a substrate, the monomers or polymers of epoxy resin in the sealant will diffuse into the liquid crystal to cause the liquid crystal contaminated and driven abnormally, whereby the damage is produced.",
        "In order to resolve the problem of incompletely curing in the prior art, the methods of incident irradiating and substrate reflecting are applied with increased curing process complexity or the danger irradiated by ultraviolet rays. Referring to FIG. 1, form a black matrix 14 and color filters, i.e. red color filter, green color filter and blue color filter, on the first glass substrate 10. Using a sealant 16 to assemble the first glass substrate 10 and the second glass substrate 12. However, the ultraviolet rays can not penetrate the black matrix 14 and an opaque thin film transistor 13 formed on the second substrate 12 to irradiate the sealant 16. Thus, the sealant 16 cannot accept enough ultraviolet light to be cured. Furthermore, the ultraviolet rays must cure the sealant 16 through the said of the substrates 10 and 12 to prevent liquid crystal 18 from dissolved.",
        "Therefor, the prior arts still can not effectively handling and resolving the problems resulting from curing by ultraviolet rays in the process of one-drop fill.",
        "In the prior art, the shielding of the black matrix causes the uncured sealant that is irradiated incompletely or the liquid crystal that is explored under the ultraviolet rays. The methods of incident irradiating is used for resolving the problem of incompletely irradiation. In consideration of the prior art, it is one object of the present invention to form the black matrix upon the TFT (thin film transistor) of the bottom glass substrate, whereby it ensures that the sealant is cured completely when the light irradiates from the top glass substrates.",
        "It is another object of the present invention to form the black matrix upon the TFT of the bottom glass substrates to avoid the light being shielded by the black matrix when the light irradiates the sealant from the top glass substrate. Thus, the light can irradiate the sealant perpendicular to the top glass substrate and the bottom glass substrate to reduce the irradiating and to ensure the quality of the liquid crystal.",
        "It is further object of the present invention not to form the black matrix on the area where the sealant is deposited on the top glass substrate to avoid the light being shielded by the black matrix when the light irradiates the sealant from the top glass substrate. Thus the curing process is easier and the restriction of the one-drop fill (ODF) process is looser.",
        "The present invention provides a method for manufacturing a liquid crystal panel. The method provides a first glass substrate for forming a thin film transistor thereon. A black matrix is formed on a first surface of the first glass substrate, wherein the black matrix includes a plurality of openings. A sealant is formed on the peripheral region of a first surface of a second glass substrate. An amount of liquid crystal is dropped in a space surrounded by the sealant disposed on the first surface of said second glass substrate. The first glass substrate and the second glass substrate is assembled by the sealant. The first surface of the first glass substrate faces the first surface of the second glass substrate. The sealant is then cured by irradiating a light from a side of the second glass substrate.",
