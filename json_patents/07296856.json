        "This application claims benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/509,501, \u201cReclining Seat with-Shear Adjustment\u201d, filed Oct. 8, 2003, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "The invention relates to reclining seats, and especially a seat for a wheelchair that has a reclining back. The invention relates in particular to a seat in which the seat back moves up and down, either automatically or under control of a user, as the angle of recline is adjusted, to reduce the shear between the back of the user and the seat back.",
        "In an ordinary seat with a reclining back, the seat back typically pivots about an axis that is roughly at the intersection of the frames of the seat back and the seat base. When an occupant of the seat rests against the seat back as it reclines, the occupant's torso rotates about his or her hip joints. The separation between the pivot axis about which the seat back rotates and the user's hip joint pivot axis about which the user's back rotates results in the seat back sliding upwards relative to the user's back as the seat back is reclined backwards, and downwards as the seat back is raised towards the upright position. This is known as \u201cshear.\u201d For most occupants, this is not a major problem. The occupant simply moves his or her torso so as to allow it to shift relative to the seat back.",
        "However, for persons of limited mobility, including many users of power wheelchairs, the necessary shift in position is less easy. There is therefore a need for a reclining seat back, especially for wheelchairs, in which the shear between the seat back and the user's back is reduced. Various solutions have been proposed, including mechanisms to bring the pivot axis of the seat back nearer to the user's hip joint pivot axis, as well as mechanisms for sliding the seat back cushion up and down relative to the seat back frame as the seat back reclines. It is believed that a novel, simple, and robust mechanism capable of translating a back support relative to a back frame would be desirable.",
        "In a first aspect, the invention is a reclining seat comprising a base and a back frame pivotally coupled to the base for rotation about a first pivot axis. A back support is slidingly coupled to the back frame for translation relative to the back frame. A mechanism includes a first portion and a second portion. The first portion has a support member pivotally coupled at a first end to the back frame at a first connection point and coupled to the second portion at a second end. The second portion has a first end pivotally coupled to the base at a second connection point and has a second end coupled to the back support. The second portion has a length from the first end to the second end in a direction extending between the first and second connection points. The length of the second portion is variable. Rotation of the back frame relative to the base varies the length of the second portion and translates the back support relative to the back frame.",
        "The support member may be a rigid structural member. Alternatively, the support member may be a linear actuator, and operation of which is selectively controllable, allowing the back support to translate independently of rotation of the back frame. Preferably, the back support includes a pair of tracks, and the second portion includes a linkage, having first, second, third and fourth links, each link having a first end and a second end, the first and second links being rotatably coupled to the base at their respective first ends and rotatably coupled at their second ends to the first ends of the third and fourth links, respectively, the third and fourth links being rotatably coupled at points intermediate their first and second ends, and the second ends of the third and fourth links being slidably coupled to the back support tracks.",
        "Preferably, the back frame is coupled to the base at a first end of the back frame and rotation of the back support frame relative to the base from an upright position into a reclined position translates the back support toward the first end of the back frame. An actuator may be coupled to the base and to the back frame to rotate the back frame relative to the base.",
        "In a second aspect, the invention is a reclining seat comprising a base and a back frame pivotally coupled to the base for rotation about the base along a first pivot axis. A back support is slidingly coupled to the back frame for translation relative to the back frame. The back support has a lower end proximate the base and an upper end distal the base. A central axis extends between the lower and upper ends. A pair of tracks is provided, each track having a longitudinal centerline symmetrically oriented at an angle relative to the back support central axis in generally a V-shaped arrangement. A linkage is formed by first, second, third, and fourth links. Each of the links has a first end and a second end. The first and second links are rotatably coupled to the base at their respective first ends and rotatably coupled at their respective second ends to the first ends of the third and fourth links. The second ends of the third and fourth links are slidably coupled to the back support tracks. A support member is pivotally coupled at a first end to the back frame and coupled at a second end to the linkage. An actuator is coupled to the base and to the back support frame to rotate the back support frame relative to the base. Rotation of the back frame relative to the base from an upright position into a reclined position translates the back support toward the first end of the back frame.",
        "In a third aspect, the invention is a reclining seat comprising a base and a back frame pivotally coupled to the base for rotation about a first pivot axis. A back support is slidingly coupled to the back frame for translation relative to the back frame. The back support has a lower end proximate the base and an upper end distal the base. A central axis extends between the lower and upper ends. A pair of tracks is provided, wherein each track has a longitudinal centerline symmetrically oriented at an angle relative to the back support central axis in generally a V-shaped arrangement. A first actuator is coupled to the base and to the back frame to rotate the back frame relative to the base. A linkage comprises at least a first link and a second link. Each link has a first end and a second end. The first and second links are pivotally coupled together proximate their respective first ends. The first and second links are slidingly engaged with the first and second tracks, respectively, proximate their respective second ends. A second actuator is operatively coupled to the first and second links to rotate the first and second links relative to one another. A support member is pivotally coupled at a first end to the back frame and coupled at a second end to the linkage. Rotation of the first and second links causes the first ends to move within the first and second tracks, causing translation of the back support relative to the back frame.",
        "In yet a fourth aspect, the invention is a reclining seat comprising a base and a back frame pivotally coupled to the base for rotation about a first pivot axis. A back support is slidingly coupled to the back frame for translation relative to the back frame. A mechanism is pivotally coupled at a first end to the back frame and pivotally coupled to the base at a second end for rotation about a second pivot axis. The mechanism is coupled to the back support at a point intermediate the first and second ends. The mechanism has a length from the first end to the second end, with the length being variable. Rotation of the back frame relative to the base varies the length of the mechanism and translates the back support relative to the back frame.",

        "With particular reference to FIGS. 3-5, the back support translation mechanism 90 is capable of movement between a first, raised position 92 corresponding to the back support upright position 74, and a second, lowered position 94 corresponding to the back support reclined position 76. The mechanism 90 includes a first portion 100 and a second portion 110. The first portion 100 has a support member 102 pivotally coupled at a first end at a first connection point to the back frame 60 at the support member mount 68. At a second end, the support member 102 is coupled to the second portion 110.",
        "The second portion 110 has a first end pivotally coupled to the base 40 at a second connection point at the linkage mount 46 through the connector 48 for rotation about a second pivot axis. The second portion 110 has a second end coupled to the back support 70. Preferably, the second portion 110 includes a linkage 120, having a first link 122, a second line 124, a third link 126 and a fourth link 128. Each link 122-128 has a first end and a second end. The first and second links 122, 124 are preferably rotatably coupled to the base 40 at their respective first ends and rotatably coupled at their second ends to the first ends of the third and fourth links 126, 128, respectively. The third and fourth links 126, 128 are rotatably coupled at points intermediate their first and second ends. The second ends of the third and fourth links 126, 128 are slidably coupled to the back support tracks 80. Preferably, the third and fourth links 126, 128 are coupled to the back support tracks 80 by followers 130. The followers 130 are preferably generally disk-shaped rollers rotatably mounted to the third and fourth links 126, 128 and received within the tracks 80.",
        "With particular reference now to FIGS. 6 and 7, the second portion 110 has a length from the second portion first end to the second portion second end in a direction extending generally between the first and second connection points. This length is variable, with a first length L1 (corresponding to the backrest assembly 30 being in its upright position 32) being greater than a second length L2 (corresponding to the backrest assembly 30 being in its reclined position 34). As discussed below in detail, rotation of the back frame 60 relative to the base 40 varies the length of the second portion 110 and translates the back support 70 relative to the back frame 60.",
        "With reference now to FIGS. 5-7, the back support translation mechanism 90 is operated as the backrest assembly 30 moves between its upright position 32 and its reclined position 34 by the first actuator 140. When the backrest assembly 30 is in its upright position 32, the back support translation mechanism 90 is in its raised position 92 and the second portion 110 has a length equal to first length L1. As the actuator 140 retracts, rotating the back frame 60 into the reclined position 34, the back support translation mechanism 90 is moved into the lowered position 94, moving the second portion 110 into a position having length L2. The back support 70 is coupled to the second portion 110, and the position of the back support 70 relative to the back frame 60 is directly related to the overall length of the second portion 110. As the length of the second portion 110 shortens, the back support 70 is translated relative to the back frame 60 from its upright position 74 towards its reclined position 76.",
        "With particular reference to FIG. 5, as the backrest assembly 30 moves from its upright position 32 into its reclined position 34 (indicated in phantom), the back support translation mechanism 90 moves from its raised position 92 into its lowered position 94 (shown in phantom). In moving from upright position 32 into reclined position 34, the support member 102 is moved toward the base 40, moving the linkage 120 in a manner such that the second ends of the third and fourth links 126, 128, coupled to the back support tracks 80 by the followers 130, slide upwardly away from the back support lower end 70a and outwardly away from the center of the back support 70. With that movement of the third and fourth links, the back support 70 is pulled downwardly, toward the back frame lower end 60b. Conversely, as the backrest assembly moves from the reclined position 34 to the upright position 32, the back support translation mechanism 90 is moved from the lowered position 94 to the raised position 92, in turn moving the back support 70 from the reclined position 76 into the upright position 74.",
        "Depending on the arrangement of the linkage 120 (in particular, relative lengths of the links 122-128 and positioning of the pivotal coupling between the third and fourth links 126, 128) and also depending upon arrangement of the tracks 80 (in particular, the inclination angle \u03b1), the linkage 120 can be made to multiply movement of the back support 70 relative to movement of the support member 102. That is, for example, a one inch movement of the support member 102 can result in a four inch movement of the back support 70. Adjustment of the inclination angle \u03b1, or of effective lengths of the links 122-128, or of position of the position of the fulcrum between the third and fourth links 126, 128 can permit movement of the back support 70 to be tailored to individual users. In particular, with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, the third and fourth links 126, 128 may each be provided with a plurality of adjustment holes 132, allowing the effective lengths of the third and fourth links 126, 128 to be readily adjusted.",
        "The support member 102 may be a rigid structural member, such as a steel rod or plate. If the support member 102 is rigid, then the back support 70 is translated only by rotation of the backrest assembly 30. Alternatively, a linear actuator (not illustrated) may be used as the support member 102. Unactivated, and locked at given length, the linear actuator would function identically as a rigid structural member, allowing the back support 70 to translate in response to rotation of the backrest assembly 30. But the linear actuator could also be controlled by the user and operated independently of rotation of the backrest assembly 30 allowing the back support 70 to translate independently of rotation of the back frame 60.",
        "From this disclosure, it will be recognized that in the first preferred embodiment back support translation mechanism 90, the second portion 110 fundamentally operates to magnify movement of the first portion 100 relative to the base 40 as the first portion 100 (and back frame 60) rotates relative to the base 40 and to transmit that magnified motion to the back support 70. Means other than the linkage 120 could be substituted to accomplish the result of transferring motion of the first portion 100 into motion of the back support 70. For example, a gear system (not illustrated) could be operatively coupled to the first portion 100, the second portion 110, and the back support 70, such that movement of the first portion 110 drives the gear system (not illustrated) to translate the back support 70 relative to the back frame 60. Furthermore, the gear system could be provided with a gear ratio such that movement of the back support 70 is greater than movement of the second portion 110. As a further alternative, if movement of the first portion 100 is sufficient, a spring device coupled directly to the back support 70 could be employed as the second portion 110.",
        "In short, from this disclosure the person of ordinary skill in the pertinent art will recognize that any of various mechanisms pivotally coupled at a first end to the back frame and pivotally coupled to the base at a second end and coupled to the back support at a point intermediate the first and second ends could also be used. The mechanisms have a length from the first end to the second end, the length being variable. Rotation of the back frame relative to the base varies the length of the mechanism. The mechanism is operably coupled to the back support to translate the back support relative to the back frame as the length of the mechanism varies.",
        "With reference now to FIGS. 8 and 9, a second preferred embodiment back support translation mechanism 200 may be incorporated into the reclining seat assembly 10, replacing the first embodiment back support translation mechanism 90. The second embodiment back support translation mechanism 200 has a raised position 202 and a lowered position 204, and comprises a linkage 210 having a first link 212 and a second link 214 and further comprises a second actuator 220 in addition to the first actuator 140. The first and second links 212, 214 each have a first end and a second end, and are preferably rotatably coupled to the support member 102 at their respective first ends and slidably coupled at their second ends to the back support tracks 80 by the followers 130. The second actuator 220 is coupled at a first end to the first link 212 and at a second end to the second link 214 to rotate the first and second links 212, 214 relative to one another. The second actuator 220 is thus coupled to the back support 70 through the first and second links 212, 214, the followers 130 and the tracks 80. The second actuator 220 is preferably electrically operated and operatively coupled to the battery 302.",
        "In operation, rotation of the first and second links 212, 214 by the second actuator 220 causes the first ends of the links 212, 214 to move within the first and second tracks 80, causing translation of the back support 70 relative to the back frame 60. The second actuator 220 may be operated independently of rotation of the backrest assembly 30. The second actuator 220 may be selectively controllable by a user, using conventional control devices and techniques well known to persons of ordinary skill in the art of control of electromechanical devices. Preferably, operation of the second actuator 220, to control translation of the back support 70, is automatically coordinated with operation of the first actuator 140, controlling rotation of the back frame 60, such that the back support 70 is automatically moved an appropriate amount in proportion to the degree of rotation of the back frame 60.",
        "Linkage 210 has a length from the first ends of links 212 and 214 to the second ends of the links 212 and 214 in a direction extending generally parallel to the plane of back support 70. With particular reference to FIG. 8, this length is variable, with a first length L1\u2032 (corresponding to the back support 70 being in its upright position 74) being greater than a second length L2\u2032 (corresponding to the back support 70 being in its reclined position 76).",
        "A reclining chair having a movable back support is thus disclosed, providing novel, simple and robust mechanisms capable of translating the back support relative to a back frame. In one embodiment, movement of the back support is driven by rotation of the back frame. In a second embodiment, movement of the back support is driven by an actuator coupled to the back support by a linkage, allowing the back support to be moved independently of the back frame.",
        "Although the invention has been described and illustrated with respect to the exemplary embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and various other changes, omissions and additions may be made therein and thereto, without parting from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, reference should be made to the appended claims, rather than to the foregoing specification, as indicating the scope of the invention."
