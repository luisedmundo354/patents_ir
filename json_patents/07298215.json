        "The entire disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2002-352664 filed on Dec. 4, 2002 including specification, claims, drawings and summary is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
        "The invention relates to an amplifying circuit for amplifying a high-frequency signal, and further to a gain-variable amplifying circuit including a plurality of the amplifying circuits.",
        "A gain-variable amplifying circuit is an important circuit in a wireless communication system. With popularization of a mobile phone and an increase in a data transmission rate in a wireless LAN system for adaptation to a multi-media system, such a gain-variable amplifying circuit is now required to be able to operate with smaller power and control a gain more precisely.",
        "FIG. 11 is a circuit diagram of an example of a conventional gain-variable amplifying circuit.",
        "The gain-variable amplifying circuit illustrated in FIG. 11 is comprised of a variable attenuator 91, and an amplifier 92 electrically connected in series to the variable attenuator 91. The illustrated gain-variable amplifying circuit controls an amplification rate by varying attenuation of the variable attenuator 91.",
        "FIG. 12 is a circuit diagram of another example of a conventional gain-variable amplifying circuit.",
        "The gain-variable amplifying circuit illustrated in FIG. 12 is comprised of a variable attenuator 93, an amplifier 94 electrically connected in parallel to the variable attenuator 93, and switches 951 and 952 through which one of the variable attenuator 93 and the amplifier 94 is selected.",
        "When the switches 951 and 952 are electrically connected to terminals associated with the amplifier 94, the amplifier 94 is selected (FIG. 12 illustrates a condition where the amplifier 94 is selected). In contrast, when the switches 951 and 952 are electrically connected to terminals associated with the variable attenuator 93, the variable attenuator 93 is selected",
        "FIG. 13 is a circuit diagram of still another example of a conventional gain-variable amplifying circuit, disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2001-345653.",
        "The gain-variable amplifying circuit illustrated in FIG. 13 is comprised of a plurality of amplifiers 961 to 96N, and a demodulator 97 electrically connected in series to each of the amplifiers 961 to 96N. Each of the amplifiers 961 to 96N is designed to have a gain different from gains of others.",
        "In the illustrated gain-variable amplifying circuit, only an amplifier suitable for providing a desired gain is turned on, and other amplifiers are turned off. As a result, the gain-variable amplifying circuit transmits an output having a high impedance, and the amplifiers turned off are electrically separated from the demodulator 97.",
        "In the gain-variable amplifying circuit illustrated in FIG. 11, since the variable attenuator 91 is arranged in a first stage, a loss of the variable attenuator 91 harmfully influences a noise index, and hence, it would not be possible to have a better noise index.",
        "In addition, since the amplifier 92 keeps carrying out amplification, power is consumed regardless of whether a desired amplification degree is high or low, power. For instance, even if an input is high and hence it is not necessary to have a high amplification degree, the amplifier 92 keeps carrying out amplification. Accordingly, in a device which operates with a battery having a limited lifetime, such as a mobile terminal, it would not be possible to extend a period of time during which the device is usable.",
        "Since the gain-variable amplifying circuit illustrated in FIG. 12 includes a plurality of switches (specifically, two switches), it is necessary to compensate for a loss caused by the switches by the amplifier 94 or an amplifier (not illustrated) arranged at a later stage in the gain-variable amplifying circuit. Thus, power consumption of the gain-variable amplifying circuit is increased.",
        "In particular, a loss caused by the switches in a frequency band beyond a couple of GHz is quite high, and hence, power consumption necessary for having a desired gain would be further increased.",
        "A frequency to which the gain-variable amplifying circuit illustrated in FIG. 13 can be applied is equal to or smaller than a couple of tens of MHz, such as IF band. Each of the amplifiers 961 to 96N is designed to have a load resistance in the range of about 50 to about 200 ohms. However, since an impedance in an off-condition lowers because of parasitic capacity of a semiconductor device, when a frequency is over GHz, an amplifier(s) turned off cannot transmit an output having a sufficiently high impedance.",
        "In order to broaden a variable range of a gain or to narrow a variable step of a gain, it would be necessary to increase a number of amplifiers electrically connected in parallel to one another. However, a signal is not transmitted to a next stage due to an impedance of an amplifier(s) turned off, resulting in reduction in a gain.",
        "In view of the above-mentioned problems in the prior art, it is an object of the present invention to provide an amplifying circuit capable of accomplishing high-impedance input/output, and providing a high gain in low power consumption.",
        "It is also an object of the present invention to provide a gain-variable amplifying circuit including a plurality of the above-mentioned amplifying circuits, having superior noise characteristics, and providing a broad band in which a gain is variable.",
        "In order to accomplish the above-mentioned object, the present invention provides an amplifying circuit including an amplifier amplifying a signal received through an input terminal, and outputting the signal through an output terminal, and a control circuit turning at least one of an input impedance and an output impedance of the amplifier into a high impedance.",
        "In the amplifying circuit in accordance with the present invention, the control circuit turns at least one of an input impedance and an output impedance of the amplifier into a high impedance. Hence, it would be possible to select one of electrical connection and disconnection without arranging a switch in a signal path, ensuring no loss caused by arranging a switch in a signal path.",
        "For instance, the control circuit may be comprised of an inductor and a switch, in which case, the inductor and the switch may be electrically connected in series to each other, and further electrically connected in an AC manner between the input or output terminal and a grounded voltage.",
        "The control circuit having the above-mentioned structure can cancel reduction in an impedance in a high-frequency band caused by a parasitic capacity of the amplifier, with the inductor.",
        "For instance, the switch is comprised of a field effect transistor.",
        "It is preferable that the inductor has an inductance resonating in parallel with a parasitic capacity of the amplifier.",
        "The inductor which resonates in parallel with a parasitic capacity of the amplifier at a particular frequency cancels reduction in an impedance in a high-frequency band caused by a parasitic capacity of the amplifier.",
        "For instance, the control circuit may be comprised of at least two transmission lines including at least a first transmission line electrically connected at one end thereof to the input or output terminal, and a second transmission line grounded at one end thereof, a total length of the at least two transmission lines being equal to K\u00d7S wherein K indicates an odd number, and S indicates a quarter of a wavelength of the signal, and a switch for selecting whether the input or output terminal is electrically connected to a grounded voltage through a transmission line having a length of K\u00d7S or through a transmission line having a length shorter than K\u00d7S.",
        "It is preferable that the transmission line having a length shorter than K\u00d7S acts as an inductor having an inductance resonating in parallel with a parasitic capacity of the amplifier.",

For instance, the capacitors 320 and 321 have about 300 fF in a field effect transistor having a gate width of 300 micrometers. If a capacity is equal to about 300 fF, the inductors 303 and 304 in an amplifying circuit which operates at a frequency of 5 GHz have an inductance of about 3 nH. Inductors having such an inductance can be readily fabricated on an IC by wire arrangement.",
        "When the amplifying circuit 100A is on and carries out normal amplification, the second and third field effect transistors 209 and 210 are off. Since the second and third field effect transistors 209 and 210 are not arranged in a signal path between the input terminal IN and the output terminal OUT, a resistance during they are off is set high. Furthermore, a shunt parasitic capacity during they are off is set low, resulting in a high impedance. Accordingly, when the second and third field effect transistors 209 and 210 are off, the inductors 303 and 304 are in a floating condition.",
        "As having been explained above, it is possible in the amplifying circuit 100A to make an input/output impedance high in a high-frequency band beyond GHz order without arranging a switch into a signal path.",

        "Furthermore, since it is possible to maintain a high gain in the gain-variable amplifying circuit 1000, even if a number of amplifying circuits electrically connected in parallel to one another is increased, it would be possible to avoid an increase in current consumption. In particular, the avoidance of an increase in current consumption is remarkable in a high-frequency band beyond GHz.",

Herein, the operational voltage is defined as a gate bias voltage at which the first field effect transistor 208 operates as an amplifier.",
