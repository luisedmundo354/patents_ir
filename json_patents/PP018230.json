        "Botanical designation: Salvia nemorosa.",
        "Cultivar denomination: \u2018Sensation Rose\u2019.",
        "The present Invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Salvia plant, botanically known as Salvia nemorosa, and hereinafter referred to by the name \u2018Sensation Rose\u2019.",
        "The new Salvia is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the Inventor in Quedlinburg, Germany. The objective of the breeding program was to create new compact Salvia cultivars that flower early.",
        "The new Salvia originated from a cross-pollination made by the Inventor in December, 2000 of a proprietary Salvia nemorosa selection identified as code number MD1700, not patented, as the female, or seed, parent with a proprietary Salvia nemorosa selection identified as code number 60608810, not patented, as the male, or pollen, parent. The new Salvia was discovered and selected by the Inventor as a single flowering plant within the progeny of the stated cross-pollination grown in a controlled environment in Quedlinburg, Germany in 2002.",
        "Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar by cuttings at Quedlinburg, Germany, since September, 2002, has shown that the unique features of this new Salvia are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations.",
        "Plants of the cultivar \u2018Sensation Rose\u2019 have not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature and light intensity without, however, any variance in genotype.",
        "The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of \u2018Sensation Rose\u2019. These characteristics in combination distinguish \u2018Sensation Rose\u2019 as a new and distinct Salvia cultivar:\n\n    \n    \n        1. Upright, somewhat outwardly spreading and compact plant habit.\n        2. Freely branching habit.\n        3. Freely flowering habit.\n        4. Red purple-colored flowers.\n        5. Good garden performance.",
        "Plants of the new Salvia are more compact than plants of the female parent selection. In addition, plants of the new Salvia and the female parent selection differ in flower color as plants of the female parent selection have blue-colored flowers.",
        "Plants of the new Salvia differ from plants of the male parent selection in the following characteristics:\n\n    \n    \n        1. Plants of the new Salvia are not as compact as plants of the male parent selection.\n        2. Plants of the new Salvia are more freely branching than plants of the male parent selection.\n        3. Inflorescences of plants of the new Salvia are denser than inflorescences of plants of the male parent selection.\n        4. Plants of the new Salvia have smaller flowers than plants of the male parent selection.\n        5. Plants of the new Salvia and the male parent selection differ in flower color.",
        "Plants of the new Salvia can be compared to plants of the Salvia cultivar Rose Queen, not patented. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Quedlinburg, Germany, plants of the new Salvia differed from plants of the cultivar Rose Queen in the following characteristics:\n\n    \n    \n        1. Plants of the new Salvia were more compact than plants of the cultivar Rose Queen.\n        2. Plants of the new Salvia were more freely branching than plants of the cultivar Rose Queen.\n        3. Inflorescences of plants of the new Salvia were denser than inflorescences of plants of the cultivar Rose Queen.",
        "Plants of the new Salvia can be compared to plants of the Salvia cultivar Rosenwein, not patented. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Quedlinburg, Germany, plants of the new Salvia differed from plants of the cultivar Rosenwein in the following characteristics:\n\n    \n    \n        1. Plants of the new Salvia were more compact than plants of the cultivar Rosenwein.\n        2. Plants of the new Salvia were more freely branching than plants of the cultivar Rosenwein.",
        "The accompanying colored photographs illustrate the overall appearance of the new cultivar, showing the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photographs may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description which accurately describe the actual colors of the new Salvia.",
        "The photograph on the first sheet comprises a side perspective view of a typical flowering plant of \u2018Sensation Rose\u2019 grown in a container.",
        "The photograph at the top of the second sheet is a close-up view of a typical inflorescence of \u2018Sensation Rose\u2019.",
        "The photograph at the bottom of the second sheet is a close-up view of a typical leaf of \u2018Sensation Rose\u2019.",
        "The aforementioned photographs, following observations and averaged measurements describe plants grown in Boskoop, The Netherlands, in an outdoor nursery under full sunlight during the spring and early summer with day temperatures ranging from 14\u00b0 C. to 32\u00b0 C. and night temperatures ranging from 4\u00b0 C. to 16\u00b0 C. Plants were grown in one-gallon containers. Plants had been growing for about two years when the photographs and description were taken.
