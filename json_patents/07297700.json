        "This invention relates to novel compounds of the class bicycloheteroaryls that are capable of modulating P2X7 receptor activity, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds. This invention also relates to methods for preventing and/or treating conditions that are causally related to aberrant P2X7 activity, such as inflammation-related conditions in mammals, comprising (but not limited to) rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, Parkinson's disease, uveitis, asthma, cardiovascular conditions including myocardial infarction, the treatment and prophylaxis of pain syndromes (acute and chronic or neuropathic), traumatic brain injury, acute spinal cord injury, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune disorders, using the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention.",
        "Cell surface receptors for ATP can be divided into metabotropic (P2Y/P2U) and ionotropic (P2X) classes. The metabotropic class belongs to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors, with seven transmembrane segments. The ionotropic class members (P2X1-P2X6) are ligand-gated ion channels, currently thought to be multisubunit proteins with two transmembrane domains per subunit (Buell et al, Europ. J. Neurosci. 8:2221 (1996)). P2Z receptors have been distinguished from other P2 receptors in three primary ways (Buisman et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:7988 (1988); Cockcroft et al, Nature 279:541 (1979); Steinberg et al, J. Biol. Chem. 262:3118 (1987)). First, activation of P2Z receptors leads not only to an inward ionic current, but also to cell permeabilization. Second, 3\u2032-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl ATP (BZATP) is the most effective agonist, and ATP itself is of rather low potency. Third, responses are strongly inhibited by extracellular magnesium ions, which has been interpreted to indicate that ATP4\u2014is the active agonist (DiVirgilio, Immunol. Today 16:524 (1995)).",
        "A seventh member of the P2X receptor family has been isolated from a rat cDNA library and, when expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, exhibits the above three properties (Surprenant et al, Science 272:735 (1996)). This receptor (rP2X7) thus corresponds to the P2Z receptor. rP2X7 is structurally related to other members of the P2X family but it has a longer cytoplasmic C-terminus domain (there is 35-40% amino acid identity in the corresponding region of homology, but the C-terminus is 239 amino acids long in the rP2X7 receptor compared with 27-20 amino acids in the others). The rP2X7 receptor functions both as a channel permeable to small cations and as a cytolytic pore. Brief applications of ATP (1-2s) transiently open the channel, as is the case of other P2X receptors. Repeated or prolonged applications of agonist cause cell permeabilization reducing the extracellular magnesium concentration potentiates this effect. The unique C-terminal domain of rP2X7 is required for cell permeabilization and the lytic actions of ATP (Suprenant et al, Science 272:735 (1996)).",
        "The P2Z/rP2X7 receptor has been implicated in lysis of antigen-presenting cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, in the mitogenic stimulation of human T lymphocytes, as well as in the formation of multinucleated giant cells (Blanchard et al, Blood 85:3173 (1995); Falzoni et al, J. Clin. Invest. 95:1207 (1995); Baricolrdi et al, Blood 87:682 (1996)). Certain functional differences exist between rodent and man (Hickman et al, Blood 84:2452 (1994)). The human macrophage P2X7 receptor (P2X7) has now been cloned and its functional properties determined (Rassendren et al, J. Biol. Chem. 272:5482 (1997). When compared with the rat P2X7 receptor, elicited cation-selective currents in the human P2X7 receptor required higher concentrations of agonists, were more potentiated by removal of extracellular magnesium ions, and revised more rapidly on agonist removal. Expression of chimeric molecules indicated that some of the differences between rat and human P2X7 receptors could be revised by exchanging the respective C-terminal domains of the receptor proteins.",
        "It has been reported that certain compounds act as P2X7 antagonists. For example, WO99/29660 and WO99/29661 disclose that certain adamantane derivatives exhibit P2X7 antagonistic activity having therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Similarly, WO99/29686 discloses that certain heterocyclic derivatives are P2X7 receptor antagonists and are useful as immunosuppressive agents and treating rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, septic shock and atheroscelerosis. Finally, WO00/71529 discloses certain substituted phenyl compounds exhibiting immunosuppressing activity. All of the references described herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.",
        "A need therefore exists for therapeutic agents, and corresponding pharmaceutical compositions and related methods of treatment, that address the conditions causally related to aberrant P2X7 activity, and it is toward the fulfillment and satisfaction of that need, that the present invention is directed.",
        "Bicycloaryl derivatives of formulas I-VIa, and their pharmaceutical compositions are disclosed as therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of conditions in mammals associated with abnormal or aberrant activity of the P2X7 receptor, including inflammatory-mediated conditions such as (but not limited to) arthritis, myocardial infarction, the treatment and prophylaxis of pain syndromes (acute and chronic [neuropathic]), traumatic brain injury, acute spinal cord injury, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory bowel disease and immune dysfunctions such as autoimmune disorders.",
        "It has now been found that the present bicycloheteroaryl compounds are capable of mediating the activity of the P2X7 receptor. This finding leads to novel compounds having therapeutic value. It also leads to pharmaceutical compositions having the compounds of the present invention as active ingredients and to their use to treat, prevent or ameliorate a range of conditions in mammals such as but not limited to inflammation of various genesis or etiology, for example rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, acute, chronic, inflammatory and neuropathic pain, dental pain and headache (such as migraine, cluster headache and tension headache) and other conditions causally related to inflammation or immune dysfunction.",
        "The compounds of the present invention are also useful for the treatment of inflammatory pain and associated hyperalgesia and allodynia. They are also useful for the treatment of neuropathic pain and associated hyperalgesis and allodynia (e.g. trigeminal or herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, causalgia, sympathetically maintained pain and deafferentation syndromes such as brachial plexus avulsion). The compounds of the present invention are also useful as anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of arthritis, and as agents to treat Parkinson's Disease, uveitis, asthma, myocardial infarction, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune disorders, renal disorders, obesity, eating disorders, cancer, schizophrenia, epilepsy, sleeping disorders, cognition, depression, anxiety, blood pressure, lipid disorders, and atherosclerosis.",
        "In one aspect, this invention provides bicycloheteroaryl compounds which are capable of modulating the activity of the P2X7 receptor, in vivo. In a further aspect, the compounds of the invention are capable of antagonizing (suppressing or inhibiting) the activity of the P2X7 receptor, and thereby treating those conditions, representative ones of which are causally related to aberrant P2X7 activity.",

When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (\u2212)-isomers respectively).

Thus, two structures may be in equilibrium through the movement of \u03c0 electrons and an atom (usually H). For example, enols and ketones are tautomers because they are rapidly interconverted by treatment with either acid or base. Another example of tautomerism is the aci- and nitro-forms of phenylnitromethane, that are likewise formed by treatment with acid or base. Representative enol-keto structures and equilibrium are illustrated below:",

        "The following biological examples, Examples 1-9, are offered to illustrate the present invention and are not to be construed in any way as limiting its scope. In the examples below, all temperatures are in degrees Celsius (unless otherwise indicated).",
        "The P2X7 receptor is strongly expressed in macrophage-derived cell lines, including, but not limited to, J774 (mouse macrophage line, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, Md., ATCC TIB-67), P388.(mouse cell line, ATCC CCL-46), P815 (mouse mast cell mastocytoma-derived line, ATCC TIB-64), THP-1 (Human monocyte-derived cell line, ATCC TIB202) and U937 (human cell line derived from histiocytic lymphoma, induceable to monocyte differentiation, ATCC CRL-1593.2) and in isolated macrophage cultures. Human or non-human animal macrophages are isolated using the procedure noted below.",
        "The P2Z/P2X7 receptor can be characterized by measuring channel opening, for instance ion flux, and/or by assessing pore formation, including by monitoring dye uptake or cell lysis in cells naturally expressing this receptor. Compounds such as ATP, 2\u2032 and 3\u2032-(O)-(4-benzoyl benzoyl) ATP (BzATP) effect the formation of pores in the plasma membrane of these cells, particularly at low extracellular divalent ion concentrations (Buisman et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:7988 (1988); Zambon et al, Cell. Immunol 156:458 (1994); Hickman et al Blood 84:2452 (1994)). Large molecular size dyes, including propidium dye YO-PRO-1, can be seen entering macrophage-derived cell lines during cell recordings (Hickman et al, Blood 84:2452 (1994); Wiley et al, Br J Pharmacol 112:946 (1994); Steinberg et al, J Biol Chem 262:8884 (1987)). Ethidium bromide (a fluorescent DNA probe) can also be monitored, where an increase in the fluorescence of intracellular DNA-bound ethidium bromide is observed. Expression of recombinant rat or human rP2X7 in cells, including HEK293 cells, and in Xenopus oocytes demonstrates influx and pore formation by whole cell recordings and YO-PRO-1 fluorescence (Suprenant et al, Science 272:735 (1996); Rassendren et al, J Biol Chem 272:5482 (1997)).",
        "The compounds of the invention may be tested for antagonist activity at the P2X7 receptor. Tests that may be performed include and are selected from: (i) electrophysiological experiments; (ii) YO-PRO1 fluorescence; (iii) ethidium bromide fluorescence; and (iv) IL-1\u03b2 release from stimulated macrophages, including as described below. Compounds can be tested in vivo in animal models including for inflammation models (e.g paw edema model, collagen-induced arthritis, EAE model of MS).",
        "Isolation of Human Macrophages",
        "Monocyte-derived human or non-human animal macrophage cultures are prepared as described by Blanchard et al (Blanchard et al, J Cell Biochem 57:452 (1995); Blanchard et al, J Immunol 147:2579 (1991)). Briefly, monocytes are isolated from leukocyte concentrates obtained from a healthy volunteer. Leukocytes are suspended in RPMI 1460 medium (Life Techologies, Inc.) with 20% serum (human for human cells), 2 mM glutamine, 5 mM HEPES, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. Cells are allowed to adhere to culture flasks for 1-2 h, after which nonadherent cells are washed away. Adherent cells are cultured for 7-14 d in this medium plus interferon-y (human for human cells) (1000 units/ml). Macrophages are recovered from the culture flask by pipetting with cold phosphate-buffered saline and plated onto glass coverslips for electrophysiological or other experiments carried out 12-24 h later.",
        "Whole cell recordings are made using the EPC9 patch-clamp amplifier and Pulse acquisition programs (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Whole-cell recordings are obtained from cells, e.g. J774A.1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md., ATCC TIB-67)); agonists are applied for periods of 1 to 3 s by a fast-flow U-tube delivery system [E. M. Fenwick, A. Marty, E. Neher, J. Physiol, (London) 331, 577 (1982)]. The internal pipette solution is 140 mM cesium-aspartate or potassium-aspartate, 20 mM NaCl, 10 mM EGTA, and 5 mM Hepes; normal external solution is 145 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes, and 12 mM glucose. Low divalent external solution is nominally magnesium-free with 0.3 mM CaCl2. Concentration-response curves are constructed in low divalent solution by recording currents in response to 1 s applications of agonist at 8 min intervals with normal external solution present for 6 min before each application. This protocol is necessary to prevent the development of sustained inward currents.",
        "Reversal potentials (Erev) are obtained by application of ATP (300 \u03bcM) or BzATP (30 \u03bcM)(controls), or the compound being tested, while the membrane is held at various potentials or by application of voltage ramps from \u2212120 to 30 or 50 mV. Permeability ratios are calculated from Erev by first computing \u03b1 (=PNa/PK, where P is permeability) for internal (i) and external (o) concentrations [Na]i=20 mM, [Na]o=145 mM, [K]o=0 mM, and [K]i=140 mM from \u03b1=([145/exp(ErevFIRT)]\u221220)/140 (where F is the Faraday, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature). Other Px/PNa values, when [X]o=145 mM, [Na]i=20 mM, [K]i=140 mM, and [Na]o=[K]o=[X]i=0 mM, are computed from Px/PNa=[(exp)ErevF/RT)] (20+140\u03b1))/145. In order of size, X is cesium, methylamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane, tetraethylammonium, and N-methyl-D-glucamine. The internal solution also contains 10 mM EGTA and 5 mM Hepes. External solutions also contain 10 mM glucose and normal or low concentrations of divalent cations; pH is maintained at 7.3 with HCl, histidine, or Hepes as required, and the osmolarity of all solutions is 295 to 315.",
        "The Photonics Imaging (IDEA) system for microscopic fluorescence measurements (Photonics, Planegg, Germany) is used. Coverslips are placed at the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert 100 or equivalent inverted microscope and viewed under oil immersion with a 40\u00d7 Fluor objective. YO-PRO-1 (10 \u03bcM; Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) is added to the superfusion fluid during electrophysiological recordings 3 to 6 min before switching to low divalent solution and washed out upon switching back to normal divalent solution, after which the fluorescent lamp is turned on and cells are examined with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. YO-PRO1 fluorescence is measured using 491/509 nm excitation/emission wavelengths. Images are obtained at 5-20 s intervals during continuous superfusion (2 ml/min) with YO-PRO1 and varying concentrations of control ATP, BzATP or compound to be tested. For each experiment, the time course of YO-PRO1 fluorescence is obtained for 10-20 individual cells and then averaged to obtain the mean fluorescence signal. Results are expressed as mean signal at 3 min for rP2X7, and the signal at 10 min is used for P2X7 and human macrophage cells. All experiments are carried out at room temperature.",
        "Compounds of the invention are tested for antagonist activity at the P2X7 receptor by monitoring Ethidium Bromide entering P2X7 receptor-expressing cells on pore formation. The test is performed in 96-well flat bottomed microtitre plates, the wells being filled with 250 \u03bcl of test solution comprising 200 \u03bcl of a suspension of P2X7-expressing cells (e.g. THP-1 cells, J774 cells, etc.)(2.5\u00d7106 cells/ml) containing 10\u22124M ethidium bromide, 25 \u03bcl of a high potassium buffer solution containing 10\u22125M BzATP, and 25 \u03bcl of a high potassium buffer solution containing test compound. The plate is covered with a plastic sheet and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for one hour. The plate is then read in a Perkin-Elmer fluorescent plate reader, excitation 520 nm, emission 595 nm, slit widths: Ex 15 nm, EM 20 nm. For the purposes of comparison, BzATP (a P2X7 receptor agonist) and pyridoxal 5-phosphate (a P2X7 receptor agonist) are used separately in the test as controls. From the readings obtained, a pIC50 figure is calculated for each test compound. This figure is the negative logarithm of the concentration of test compound necessary to reduce the BzATP agonist activity by 50%.",
        "This Example demonstrates the testing of the compounds of this invention for efficacy as inhibitors of P2X7-mediated release of IL-1\u03b2 from human macrophages activated by the Alzheimer's beta amyloid peptide 1-42.",
        "Cell Isolation",
        "Monocytes are isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as follows. Whole blood is layered directly onto Histopak 1077-1 columns (Sigma Biochemicals) and centrifuged at 800\u00d7g for 15 minutes. The PBMC band of cells is removed to a fresh 50 ml culture tube and diluted 1:1 with wash buffer (Phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 containing 2 mM EDTA and 5 mg/ml BSA) followed by centrifugation at 800\u00d7g for 5 minutes. Cells are then washed by sequential resuspension of the cell pellet in wash buffer and centrifugation at 600\u00d7g for 5 minutes. The wash process is repeated until the supernatent is clear of contaminating platelets (generally, 5 to 6 washes). Monocytes are then purified from the PBMCs by negative selection using a monocyte isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Inc.) that contains antibodies to non-monocytic cells, running the cells over a magnetic column to remove antibody-bound cells, and collecting the flow through volume of monocytes. Monocytes are washed once with wash buffer and seeded at 10E5 cells per well in 100 \u03bcl serum-free RPMI 1640 in 96-well plates and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% CO2/95% humidified tissue culture incubator. After 1 hour, the medium is replaced with 100 \u03bcl complete culture medium (RPMI 1640, 10% human serum-type AB (heat inactivated), 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM glutamine, 50 U/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin) and incubated overnight (16 hours).",
        "Dosing Regimen",
        "The next day, the culture medium is replaced with 100 \u03bcl fresh complete culture medium in the absence or presence of human beta amyloid 142 peptide (5 \u03bcM) and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% CO2/95% humidified tissue culture incubator for 5 hours. Medium is then removed and discarded. Each well is washed once with Hanks buffered saline (HBSS) containing 1 mM CaCl2 followed by the addition of 80 \u03bcl of HBSS/CaCl2-inhibiting compound of the present invention (10\u00d7 stock in HBSS/CaCl2 for a final concentration of 23 nM and 206 nM) and incubated 15 minutes in the tissue culture incubator followed by the addition of either 10 \u03bcl of HBSS/CaCl2 or 10 \u03bcl of benzoyl ATP (BzATP; 3 mM stock in HBSS/CaCl2 for a 300 \u03bcM final concentration) and incubated for a further 30 minutes in the tissue culture incubator. Medium is then removed to new 96-well plates for storage at \u221270\u00b0 C. until the IL-1\u03b2 content is quantitated by ELISA (from R&D Systems). The cells are washed once with HBSS/CaCl2 followed by lysing the cells with 100 \u03bcl ice cold lysis buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 tablet per 30 ml Complete TM protease inhibitor from Roche Biochemicals, Inc). Cell lysates are stored at \u221270\u00b0 C. until the IL-1\u03b2 is quantitated by ELISA.",

All rats for use in studies are to be fasted beginning at 3:00 pm the day prior to surgery but given free access to water. Prior to surgery each rat is weighed. The rat is initially induced with 5% isoflurane (Aerrane, Fort Dodge), combined with 30% O2, 70% N2O for 2-5 minutes. The rat is then placed on a circulating water-heating pad and into a nose cone for spontaneous respiration of anesthetic gases. The isoflurane is reduced to 2%. A rectal probe is inserted and body temperature maintained at 36.5-37.5\u00b0 C. The hair is clipped at all surgical sites and these regions will then be scrubbed with Betadine.",

Careful dissection, isolation and retraction of the sternomastoideus, digastricus, and sternohyoideus muscles is made to expose the right common, internal and external carotid arteries. The right common carotid artery is isolated with a 5-0 silk suture. During surgery the suture is released allowing reperfusion every 2-4 minutes. The right external carotid and superior thyroid arteries are also isolated and the superior thyroid is cauterized, while the external carotid is ligated distally with a 5-0 silk suture. Another 5-0 silk suture is loosely tied around the external carotid artery. The occipital artery is isolated, ligated and incised. The internal carotid is isolated.",
        "With the common and external carotid arteries immobilized, an aneurysm clip is placed onto the internal carotid artery. A small incision is made at the distal end of the external carotid. A 3-0 nylon suture coated with poly-L-lysine is then inserted into the external carotid and up into the common carotid artery. The loosely tied 5-0 silk suture around the external carotid is now gently tightened around the filament. The external carotid artery is then incised and the remaining piece of the external carotid artery with the filament is rotated so that the filament may be inserted into the internal carotid artery the length of insertion depending on the weight and rat strain. In Sprague Dawley rats the monofilament is inserted 18-19 mm (18 mm for rats weighing<300 gm,19 mm for rats weighing 300 gm) effectively blocking blood flow to the middle cerebral artery.",
        "The external jugular vein will be cannulated with PE 50 tubing for I.V. administration of compounds. The cannula will be exteriorized at the previously shaven, scruff of the neck and sutured in place. The wound will be closed by means of suture. The right femoral artery is catheterized for blood gas and glucose determination during surgery.",
        "Two hours after the insertion of the monofilament suture the rats are re-anesthetized with the same anesthetic combination used initially and placed back into the nose cone with the reduction of isoflurane concentration to 2%. The neck incision is reopened to expose the external carotid artery. The restoration of blood flow is accomplished by completely withdrawing the intraluminal suture from the carotid arteries. The incision is then closed with 3-0 silk in an interrupted stitch.",

Briefly, the high-thigh level of the left sciatic nerve is exposed after skin incision and blunt separation of muscles at a site near the trochanter just distal to the point at which the posterior biceps semitendious nerve nerve branches from the common sciatic nerve. The nerve is then fixed in this position with fine forceps by pinching the epineurium on its dorsal aspect, taking care not to press the nerve against underlying structures. An 8-0 silicon-treated silk suture is inserted into the nerve with a \u215c curved, reversed-cutting mini-needle, and tightly ligated so that the dorsal \u2153-\u00bd of the nerve is trapped in the ligature.
