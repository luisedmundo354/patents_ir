        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a seal device disposed in crawler roller, reduction gear, hydraulic motor, track roller or the like. More particularly, the invention relates to a seal device for crawler roller, hydraulic motor or the like used in construction machinery, which provides an effective seal against a process.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "There is a seal device of a mechanical seal type as a prior art related to the present invention which is employed in a crawler unit. This seal device is installed between a casing and a rotary member in order to keep out slurry, dirt, water containing abrasive particles or the like from the relatively rotating interface therebetween. This, however, necessitates use of a resilient O-ring for providing a seal between a seal ring of the seal device and the casing which retains the seal ring in a mating manner. Abrasive particles entrapped between the seal ring and the casing are likely to cause rapid wear of the seal ring and the casing. Wear of an urging spring for the seal ring and immersion of the spring in the dirt due to the abrasive particles will lead to an insufficient urging force against the seal ring. To alleviate these problems, resilient rings are introduced to provide not only a resilient force to the seal ring but also a seal at the interface between the contact surfaces where the seal ring is retained.",
        "Primary related art of the present invention is found as a floating seal disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,086,069 issued to Bedford as shown in FIG. 9. This illustrates a cross sectional view of a floating seal 101 mounted in a crawler roller unit. In FIG. 9, a reference numeral 120 represents a shaft. The shaft 120 is disposed within a through bore of a roller 125, and a floating seal 101 is disposed in the gap formed between the shaft 120 and the roller 125. The floating seal 101 provides a seal by preventing dirt water or fine dirt particles from entering thereto.",
        "In this floating seal 101, a first resilient ring 102 has an annularly shaped body whose cross section is \u201cJ\u201d-shaped and outer surface forms a curved concave face 105. One end face of the primary resilient ring 102 is defined as outer fitting face 102A while the other end face is defined as inner fitting face 102B. Likewise, a second resilient ring 103 has also an annularly shaped body whose cross section is \u201cJ\u201d-shaped and outer surface forms a curved concave face 105. Therefore one end face of the secondary resilient ring 103 defines outer fitting face 103A while the other end face defines inner fitting face 103B.",
        "Next a first seal ring 110 has an annularly shaped body whose cross section is \u201cU\u201d-shaped and its radially extending end face of the first seal ring 110 defines a seal face 110A. An annular groove of the seal ring 110 which is located on the other side of the seal face 110A defines a mount groove portion 110B. Likewise, a second seal ring 111 has an annularly shaped body whose cross section is also \u201cU\u201d-shaped and its radially extending end face of the second seal ring 111 defines a mating seal face 111A. An annular groove disposed on the other side of the seal face 111A then defines a mount groove portion 111B.",
        "The first resilient ring 102 and the second resilient ring 103 thus constructed as well as the first seal ring 110 and the second seal ring 111 are all installed within the chamber formed between the shaft 120 and the roller 125, as depicted in FIG. 8. Therefore the first resilient ring 102 and the second resilient ring 103 retain curved concave surfaces 105, 105 relative to an ambient passage chamber 126. Also the first resilient ring 102 and the second resilient ring 103 possess curved convex surfaces relative to a lubricant-filled internal chamber 127. The first resilient ring 102 exerts a resiliently urging force such that the seal surface 110A of the first seal ring 110 is pressed against the second seal ring 103. The opposed seal surfaces 110A and 111A being pressed against each other provide an effective seal for the process fluid coming into the ambient passage chamber 126.",
        "When the first pressure receiving surface 105 of the first resilient seal ring 102 and the second pressure receiving surface 105 of the second resilient seal ring 103 are acted on by the sealed fluid from the ambient communication chamber 126 side, the first pressure receiving surface 105 of the first resilient seal ring 102 and the second pressure receiving surface 105 of the second resilient seal ring 103 which are bent to form concave surfaces are further bent toward the internal chamber 127 side due to the fluid pressure. This causes the contact forces at the first seal surface 110A and the second seal surface 110A to decrease. At the same time, this also induces elastic deformation of the first resilient ring 102 and the second resilient ring 103 in such a direction that the first inner circumferential mount portion 102B of the first resilient ring 102 and the second inner circumferential mount portion 103B of the second resilient ring 103 may depart from the first mount concave portion 110B and the second mount concave portion 111B, respectively. As a result, seal ability at the first mount concave portion 110B and the second mount concave portion 111B is weakened. Furthermore, sealed fluid or fine dirt particles entering from the ambient communication chamber 126 side into the interface gap formed between the first inner circumferential mount portion 102B and the first mount concave portion 110B and another gap between the second inner circumferential mount portion 103B and the second mount concave portion 111B will cause wear of the contact surfaces of the first inner circumferential mount portion 102B and the second inner circumferential mount portion 103B. This will lead to a deterioration of the seal performance in the floating seal 101.",
        "In particular, the first seal ring 110 and the second seal ring 111 are resiliently urged against each other by the first resilient ring 102 and the second resilient ring 103, respectively. In this configuration, elastic deformation of the first resilient ring 102 and the second resilient ring 103 causes the contact force between the first seal surface 110A of the first seal ring 110 and the second seal surface 111A of the second seal ring 111 to decrease. Such elastic deformation also causes the first seal surface 110A and the second seal surface 111A being in contact to",
        "Moreover, there is another type of floating seal disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,826,884 issued to Anderton. For the track seal assembly disclosed therein, a loading member corresponding to a resilient ring is arranged to urge a ceramic seal member against a seal surface, similarly to the descriptions in FIG. 9. Thus there remain similar problems encountered in FIG. 9.",
        "The present invention is introduced to alleviate the above mentioned problems. A primary technical goal which this invention tries to achieve is to provide a seal ring with a desired urging force by means of a resilient seal ring and to exhibit seal capability of a seal surface by sealingly retaining the seal ring even under the influence of pressure of dirt water or the like. Another goal is to prevent dirt water or the like from leaking to the interface between the resilient seal ring and the support portion by sealingly retaining the seal ring with the resilient seal ring. Yet another goal is to prevent dirt water or the like from giving damage to the mount surfaces of the resilient seal ring.",
        "A primary object of the present invention is to alleviate the above mentioned technical disadvantages, and a solution to such disadvantages is embodied as follows.",
        "A seal device related with the present invention is for effecting a seal between a shaft disposing a retainer portion and a ring member being inserted over the shaft and being rotatable relative to the shaft. The seal device comprises a second seal ring, a first seal ring, a first resilient body member and a first seal lip member, wherein the second seal ring has a second seal surface and is sealingly retained by packings, the packings being disposed at one member of either a retainer portion or a ring member, wherein the first seal ring is inserted over the shaft and has a first seal surface, a first support portion and a first outer diameter seal contact surface, the first seal surface facing oppositely against the second seal surface, the first support portion being disposed on the opposite side to the first seal surface, the first outer diameter seal contact surface being disposed on the outer circumferential surface between the first seal surface and the first support portion, wherein the first resilient body member is made of rubber-like elastic material and retains a first inner circumferential seal portion at its one end and a first outer circumferential seal portion at the other end and provides the first seal ring with an urging force, the first inner circumferential seal portion being engaged with the first support portion of the first seal ring, the first outer circumferential seal portion being engaged with the other member of either a retainer portion or a ring member, wherein the first seal lip member protrudes from the first resilient body member in an integral manner and is matingly brought into seal contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface.",
        "According to the seal device related to the present invention, since the first seal lip member and the second seal lip member are brought into seal contact with the outer diameter seal contact surfaces, the sealed fluid pressure exerted from the ambient communication chamber side acts on the action circumferential surfaces of the individual seal lip members. This intensifies the contact of the seal lip members against the outer diameter circumferential seal contact surfaces and effectively prevents the sealed fluid from leaking into the interfaces between the first support portion and the first inner circumferential seal portion and between the second support portion and the second inner circumferential seal portion. And elastic deformation of the resilient body members is able to maintain sufficient urging forces to keep seal contact between the mutually opposing seal surfaces. Further, the seal lip members which are in a seal contact relation with the corresponding outer diameter seal contact surfaces resist against the elastic deformation of the resilient body members. This in turn provides urging forces to the seal rings and effectively prevents a decrease in contact strength at the seal surfaces. The first seal surface of the first seal ring which is sealingly retained by the first seal lip member can be brought into secure seal contact with the second seal surface of the second seal ring for outstanding seal performance even against dirt water as sealed fluid.",

FIG. 7 shows a seal device 1 representing a fifth embodiment related to the present invention. Also FIG. 8 shows a seal device 1 representing a sixth embodiment related to the present invention.",
        "In FIGS. 1 and 2, the seal device (floating seal) 1 is disposed within a seal chamber 70 which is formed between a roller 50 and a shaft 60. The seal chamber 70 is defined as an inner space surrounded by the shaft 60, a first fixing surface 51A of a bushing (annular portion) 51 which is mounted via an O-ring 20 at the end portion of the roller 50, and a retainer surface 61A of a cover (retaining portion) 61 which is attached to the shaft 60. It is possible to replace the bushing 51 by a resilient seal ring which is directly mounted to the roller 50. In this case, the roller 50 itself constitutes the annular portion 51. Choice of the annular portion 51 and the retaining portion 61 should not be restricted to the examples described here. Instead, they should be considered as one component and its mating component both of which mount a seal device and rotate relative to each other.",
        "Seal device 1 disposed a first resilient seal ring 2 and a second resilient seal ring 3 therein. A first resilient body member 2A in an annular form constitutes a main body of the first resilient seal ring 2. The outer circumferential portion of the first resilient body member 2A is defined as a first outer circumferential seal portion 2B while the inner circumferential portion is defined as a first inner circumferential seal portion 2C. The first resilient body member 2A makes a small angle in a direction from a fixing surface 51A toward a first support portion 4B wherein the small angle causes a resilient, urging force which presses against a first seal ring 4 in the axial direction. The angle of the first resilient body member 2A is a design parameter which is a function of the urging force to the first seal ring 4 and the length of the first resilient body member 2A. The first outer circumferential seal portion 2B is formed so as to engage with the fixing surface 51A of \u201cL\u201d-shaped cross section. The first outer circumferential seal portion 2B also retains a protruding first base portion 2B1. The first inner circumferential seal portion 2C is formed so as to engage with the outer perimeter surface of a first support portion 4B which defines the \u201cL\u201d-shaped outer circumferential surface of the first seal ring 4.",
        "The first resilient body member 2A also disposes a first seal lip member 6A which has a tapered diameter surface and protrudes forward against the sealed fluid (left direction in the figure). Outer diameter surface of the first seal lip member 6A defines a first action diameter surface 6A2 to which the sealed fluid acts on. The inner diameter surface of the front tip portion of the first seal lip member 6A defines a first seal contact surface 6A1 whose contact length with a first outer diameter seal contact surface 4C is less than 16 mm. The free end portion of the first seal lip member 6A has a larger wall thickness than its root portion located toward the first resilient body member 2A. The first seal contact surface 6A1 defines a tapered surface making an angle toward the root portion in the range of from 1 degree to 45 degrees. This configuration allows the first seal contact surface 6A1 to be brought into contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface 4C at an optimal surface pressure and to exhibit an outstanding seal performance against the sealed fluid.",
        "It has been shown that the first seal contact surface 6A1 is configured to form a seal-tight contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface 4C of the first seal ring 4. In addition, the first outer circumferential seal portion 2B retains a first seal portion 7A which protrudes toward the same direction as the first seal lip member 6A and is brought into a seal contact with the fixing surface 51A. An annular groove formed between the first seal portion 7A and the first action diameter surface 6A2 defines a first pressure receiving groove 8A. The fluid pressure acted onto the first pressure receiving groove 8A effectively prevents the fluid from flowing into an internal chamber B because of the seal contact formed between the first seal portion 7A and the fixing surface 51A of the bushing 51. The first resilient seal ring 2 is made of a rubber material, thus elastic. Examples of the rubber material include perfluoro-elastomer, nitrile rubber (NBR) of hardness DuroA 60 to 80, urethane rubber (U), fluoro rubber (FKM), isobutylene-isoprene rubber (IIR), nitrile hydride rubber (H-NBR), elastic resin (for example, tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoromethylvinylether rubber) and so on.",
        "A second resilient seal ring 3 is disposed in a symmetrical manner with respect to the first resilient seal ring 2. A second resilient body member 3A in an annular form constitutes a main body of the second resilient seal ring 3. The outer circumferential portion of the second resilient body member 3A is defined as a second outer circumferential seal portion 3B while the inner circumferential portion is defined as a second inner circumferential seal portion 3C. Furthermore, the second resilient body member 3A makes an angle in a direction from the second outer circumferential seal portion 3B toward the second inner circumferential seal portion 3C. Namely, the second resilient body member 3A makes a small angle in a direction from a retainer surface 61A toward a second support portion 5B wherein the small angle causes a resilient, urging force which presses against a second seal ring 5 in the axial direction. The angle of the second resilient body member 3A is a design parameter which is a function of the urging force to the second seal ring 5 and the length of the second resilient body member 3A. The second outer circumferential seal portion 3B is formed so as to engage with the retainer surface 61A of \u201cL\u201d-shaped cross section. The second outer circumferential seal portion 3B also retains a protruding second base portion 3B1. The second inner circumferential seal portion 3C is formed so as to engage with the outer perimeter surface of a second support portion 5B which defines the \u201cL\u201d-shaped outer circumferential surface of the second seal ring 5.",
        "The second resilient body member 3A also disposes a second seal lip member 6B which has a tapered diameter surface and protrudes forward against the sealed fluid (right direction in the figure). Outer diameter surface of the second seal lip member 6B defines a second action diameter surface 6B2 to which the sealed fluid acts on. In addition, the second outer circumferential seal portion 3B retains a second seal portion 7B which protrudes toward the same direction as the second seal lip member 6B and is brought into a seal contact with the retainer surface 61A. An annular groove formed between the second seal portion 7B and the second action diameter surface 6B2 defines a second pressure receiving groove 8B. The fluid pressure acted onto the second pressure receiving groove 8B effectively prevents the fluid from flowing into the internal chamber B because of the seal contact formed between the second seal portion 7B and the retainer surface 61A of the cover 61. The second resilient seal ring 3 is made of a rubber material, thus elastic. Examples of the rubber material include perfluoro-elastomer, nitrile rubber (NBR) of hardness DuroA 60 to 80, urethane rubber (U), fluoro rubber (FKM), isobutylene-isoprene rubber (IIR), nitrile hydride rubber (H-NBR), elastic resin (for example, tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoromethylvinylether rubber) and so on.",
        "A pair of the first seal ring 4 and the second seal ring 5 symmetrically arranged to each other are disposed in a symmetrical manner. The first seal ring 4 retains an annular body form whose cross section is \u201cL\u201d-shaped. A first seal face 4A is disposed on the side surface of a first flange portion 4D of the first seal ring 4. The optimal contact length of the first seal face 4A can be achieved by making the radially inner portion of the side surface a tapered surface or a step shoulder surface. The \u201cL\u201d-sectioned outer circumferential surface of the first seal ring 4 constitutes the first support portion 4B. The outer circumferential surface of the first flange portion 4D defining the first seal face 4A of the first seal ring 4 constitutes the first outer diameter seal contact surface 4C. A first inner diameter surface 4E of the first seal ring 4 forms a clearance fit relative to the shaft 60 with a gap therebetween.",
        "The second seal ring 5, the other component constituting the pair, retains an annular body form whose cross section is \u201cL\u201d-shaped. The side surface of a second flange portion 5D of the second seal ring 5 defines a second seal face 5A which comes into seal contact with the first seal face 4A. The radially inner portion of the side surface of the second seal face 5A is arranged to form a tapered surface or a step shoulder surface to the axial direction. The \u201cL\u201d-sectioned outer circumferential surface of the second seal ring 5 constitutes the second support portion 5B. The outer circumferential surface of the second flange portion 5D defining the second seal face 5A of the second seal ring 5 constitutes the second outer diameter seal contact surface 5C. A second inner diameter surface 5E of the second seal ring 5 forms a clearance fit relative to the shaft 60 with a gap therebetween.",
        "The first seal ring 4 and the second seal ring 5 are made of cast iron, heat treated steel, heat resistive metal alloy, SiC, super-hard alloy, alumina ceramics or the like. Or one of the first seal ring 4 and the second seal ring 5 can be made of carbon material for a small friction coefficient. The first seal ring 4 can be fixed with the bushing 51 via a drive pin, not shown, such that they rotate together. Likewise, the second seal ring 5 can be fixed with the cover 61 via another drive pin so that the second seal ring 5 is not dragged by the first seal ring 4. Furthermore, a resilient force may be reinforced for the first resilient body member 2A by immersing a leaf spring or coil spring therein.",
        "In the first resilient seal ring 2 thus constructed, as seen in FIGS. 1 and 2, the first outer circumferential seal portion 2B fits the fixing surface 51A of the bushing 51 while the first inner circumferential seal portion 2C fits the first support portion 4B of the first seal ring 4. And the elastic force of the first resilient body member 2A urges the first seal surface 4A of the first seal ring 4 against the second seal surface 5A of the second seal ring 5. The first seal contact surface 6A1 of the first seal lip member 6A which is brought into seal contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface 4C of the first flange portion 4D effectively prevents the sealed fluid from leaking through the fit surface between the first inner circumferential seal portion 2C and the first support portion 4B. This in turn prevents the first resilient body member 2A from lifting off the first support portion 4B and elastically deforming toward the internal chamber B.",
        "The first resilient body member 2A is able to provide the first seal surface 4A of the first seal ring 4 with a sufficient, resilient force for maintaining a seal-tight contact relative to the second seal surface 5A. The first pressure receiving groove 8A acted on by the sealed fluid pressure intensifies the degree of seal contact in the first seal portion 7A of the first outer diameter contact seal portion 2B relative to fixing surface 51A, which further prevents the sealed fluid from leaking to the internal chamber B through the fit surface formed by the first outer diameter contact seal portion 2B and the fixing surface 51A. The fit surface of the first outer diameter contact seal portion 2B and the fixing surface 51A thus reinforced due to the first seal portion 7A avoids unwanted deformation of the first resilient body member 2A, and the elastic force of the first resilient body member 2A enhances the seal performance of the first seal surface 4A. In the second resilient seal ring 3, like the first resilient seal ring 2, the second outer circumferential seal portion 3B fits the retainer surface 61A while the second inner circumferential seal portion 3C fits the second support portion 5B of the second seal ring 5. And the elastic force of the second resilient body member 3A urges the second seal surface 5A of the second seal ring 5 against the first seal surface 4A of the first seal ring 4.",

This in turn prevents the second resilient body member 3A from lifting off the second support portion 5B and elastically deforming toward the internal chamber B. The second resilient body member 3A is able to provide the second seal surface 5A of the second seal ring 5 with a sufficient, resilient force for maintaining a seal-tight contact relative to the first seal surface 4A.",
        "The seal device 1 illustrated in FIG. 2 is so constructed that the roller 50 rotates, thus the first seal ring 4 serving as a rotary seal ring. Therefore the second seal ring becomes a stationary seal ring. The arrangement of the rotary seal ring 4 and the stationary seal ring 5 can be swapped with each other depending on the type of machine the seal device is mounted on. It, however, is possible to effect a seal by employing a different form from the one indicated in FIG. 1 for either one of the first resilient seal ring 2 or the second resilient seal ring 3. For example, in case of the situation where few fine particles are contained in the sealed fluid, a rectangle-sectioned resilient seal ring can be used along the tilting angle for exerting a resilient, urging force against the seal ring.",
        "The seal device 1 effects a seal against a sealed fluid such as dirt water or the like which is allowed to flow in through the ambient communication chamber A as the roller 50 rotates. In an adjacency of the internal chamber B, the roller 50 and the shaft 60 dispose bearings 25 therebetween and lubricants applied thereto. Even if the lubricants exert a pressure to the first resilient seal ring 2 and the second resilient seal ring 3, the support offered by the first reinforcement ring 22 and the second reinforcement ring 23, respectively, maintain elastic deformation of the rings without a drop of the seal capability. The lubricant pressure will rather lead to enhancing the seal capability as the result of more secure contact between the first seal surface 4A and the second seal surface 5A.",
        "FIG. 3 shows a half sectional view of first resilient seal ring 2 and first seal ring 4 mated under an unloaded condition. It is noted that second resilient seal ring (packing) 13 is configured in a symmetrical manner to the first resilient seal ring 2. Its shape, however, is not restricted to be identical to that of the first resilient seal ring 2. For instance, the second seal ring 5 can approximately have a rectangular cross section. The three adjacent faces of the second seal ring 5 on its back face side are fittingly supported by the \u201cU\u201d-shape sectioned second resilient seal ring (packing) 13 which is fitted to the groove of the cover (retainer portion) 61. The second resilient seal ring 13 can be replaced by an O-ring (packing) mounted in an installation groove of the cover (retainer portion) 61. Under such a circumstance, the first resilient seal ring 2 exhibits a seal performance relative to this invention. This implies that the current invention can be embodied not only by combination of the first resilient seal ring 2 and the first seal ring 4 but also by substituting the first resilient seal ring 2 by the second resilient seal ring (packing) 13.",
        "What the first resilient seal ring 2 (also second resilient seal ring 3) in FIG. 3 makes a difference from that in FIG. 1 is that the inner diameter surface of the front tip portion of the first seal lip member 6A defines a first seal contact surface 6A1 whose contact length with a first outer diameter seal contact surface 4C is in a range of from 1 mm to 12 mm. The free end portion of the first seal lip member 6A has a larger wall thickness than its root portion located toward the first resilient body member 2A. The first seal contact surface 6A1 defines a tapered surface making an angle toward the root portion in the range of from 1 degree to 45 degrees. This configuration allows the first seal contact surface 6A1 to be brought into contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface 4C at an optimal surface pressure and to exhibit an outstanding seal performance against the sealed fluid. As a result, unwanted elastic deformation of the first resilient body member 2A is prevented and seal ability of the first seal face 4A and the second seal face 5A is enhanced. The first outer circumferential seal portion 2B also includes a first base portion 2B1 which protrudes in an opposite direction relative to the first seal lip member 6A. The first base portion 2B1 provides the first outer circumferential seal portion 2B with a resilient, urging force in the axial direction. Annular groove formed between the first action diameter surface 6A2 and the first seal portion 7A defines a first pressure receiving groove 8A.",
        "FIG. 4 illustrates how the first resilient seal ring 2 in FIG. 3 deforms when loaded by fluid pressure of 0.6 MPa from the ambient communication chamber A. With the first resilient seal ring 2 in FIG. 3 as a comparison example 1 wherein a first seal lip member 6A is not employed in the resilient seal ring, it has been experimentally verified that application of 0.6 MPa fluid pressure to the resilient seal ring causes the surface pressure on the seal face to be reduced from 2.5 kN at an unloaded condition to one seventh of the surface pressure. On the other hand, with another example wherein the first seal lip member 6A is employed in the resilient seal ring 2, experiments under the same condition result in a surface pressure drop to only 1/2.3. These experimental results show that even if the first resilient seal ring 2 is acted on by fluid pressure through the ambient communication chamber A, an elastic deformation of the first resilient seal ring 2 toward the internal chamber B does not occur. This will lead to maintenance of the normal, resilient urging force between the first seal face 4A and the second seal face 5A, which in turn implies outstanding seal capability to be exhibited between the first seal face 4A and the second seal face 5A.",
        "FIG. 5 shows a seal device 1 as a third embodiment related to the present invention. A difference between the seal device 1 in FIG. 5 and that in FIG. 1 is that the first seal lip member 6A of the former has a trapezoidal shape. Another difference is that the opposite end surface of the first resilient seal ring 2 relative to the first seal lip member 6A has an arcuate form. This configuration is intended to prevent elastic deformation of the resilient body member 2A caused by the fluid pressure through the ambient communication chamber A. Therefore, the elastic forces of the first resilient seal ring 2 and the second resilient seal ring 3 are strong enough to maintain outstanding seal ability at between the first seal face 4A of the first seal ring 4 and the second seal face 5A of the second seal ring 5 even under the presence of the fluid pressure being acted onto the first resilient seal ring 2 and the second resilient seal ring 3.",

This provides an optimal surface pressure at the first seal contact surface 6A1 and effectively prevents the sealed fluid from leaking into the interface between the first seal contact surface 6A1 and the first outer diameter seal contact surface 4C. Axial length of the protruding portion of the first seal portion 7A is arranged smaller than that of the first seal lip member 6A. The length of the first seal portion 7A, if necessary, can be made as large as that of the first seal lip member 6A.

The short axial length of the first seal portion 7A also contributes to intensifying the contact between the first seal contact surface 6A1 and the first outer diameter seal contact surface 4C since more significant fluid pressure acts on the first action diameter surface 6A2 of the first seal lip member 6A.

        "According to the seal device related to the sixth invention, the first seal lip member 6A and the first seal portion 7A retain the first pressure receiving groove 8A therebetween and the two faces of the first pressure receiving groove 8A are brought into contact with each other. When a fluid pressure is moderate, the fluid pressure acts on the first action diameter surface 6A2 located on the outer circumferential surface of the first seal lip member 6A in order to bring the first seal contact surface 6A1 into seal contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface 4C. When the fluid pressure becomes high enough to open up the first pressure receiving groove 8A, the fluid pressure guided to within the first pressure receiving groove 8A operates so as to bring the first seal contact surface 6A1 of the first seal lip member 6A into compressive contact with the first outer diameter seal contact surface 4C. Likewise, the first seal portion 7A is also brought into compressive contact with the fixing surface 51A. This configuration allows the sealed fluid, dirt water or high pressure fluid, to operate to open up the first pressure receiving groove 8A for effecting seal. The second seal lip member 6B operates in a similar manner for the same effect. Thus, a seal fluid such as dirt water can effectively be sealed.",
