        "The compounds disclosed herein are related to the biological and chemical analogs of modafinil. Modafinil, C15H15NO2S, also known as 2-(benzhydrylsulfinyl) acetamide, or 2-[(diphenylmethyl) sulfinyl] acetamide, a synthetic acetamide derivative with wake-promoting activity, has been described in French Patent No. 78 05 510 and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,177,290 (\u201cthe '290 patent\u201d). It has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Methods for preparing modafinil and several derivatives are described in the '290 patent. The levorotatory isomer of modafinil, along with additional modafinil derivatives are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,927,855, and are reported to be useful for treatment of hypersomnia, depression, Alzheimer's disease and to have activity towards the symptoms of dementia and loss of memory, especially in the elderly.",
        "Modafinil has also been described as a useful agent in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (U.S. Pat. No. 5,180,745); in the protection of cerebral tissue from ischemia (U.S. Pat. No. 5,391,576); in the treatment of urinary and fecal incontinence (U.S. Pat. No. 5,401,776); and in the treatment of sleep apneas and disorders of central origin (U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,379). In addition, modafinil may be used in the treatment of eating disorders, or to promote weight gain or stimulate appetite in humans or animals (U.S. Pat. No. 6,455,588), or in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (U.S. Pat. No. 6,346,548), or fatigue, especially fatigue associated with multiple sclerosis (U.S. Pat. No. 6,488,164). U.S. Pat. No. 4,066,686 describes various benzhydrylsulphinyl derivatives as being useful in therapy for treating disturbances of the central nervous system.",
        "Several published patent applications describe derivative forms of modafinil and the use of modafinil derivatives in the treatment of various disorders. For example, PCT publication WO 99/25329 describes various substituted phenyl analogs of modafinil as being useful for treating drug-induced sleepiness, especially sleepiness associated with administration of morphine to cancer patients. U.S. Pat No. 5,719,168 and PCT Publication No. 95/01171 describe modafinil derivatives that are useful for modifying feeding behavior. PCT Publication No. 02/10125 describes several modafinil derivatives of modafinil, along with various polymorphic forms of modafinil.",

        "Animal Surgery. Adult, male Wistar rats (275-320 g from Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass.) were anesthetized (Nembutal, 45 mg/kg, ip.) and surgically prepared with implants for recording of chronic EEG (encephalographic) and EMG (electromyographic) recording. The EEG implants were made from commercially available components (Plastics One, Roanoke, Va.). EEG signals were recorded from stainless steel screw electrodes: 2 frontal (+3.0 mm AP from bregma, \u00b12.0 mm ML), and 2 occipital (\u22124.0 mm AP from bregma, \u00b12.0 mm ML). Two Teflon-coated stainless steel wires were positioned under the nuchal trapezoid muscles for EMG recording. All electrode leads were inserted into a connector pedestal and the pedestal affixed to the skull by application dental acrylic. Antibiotic was administered post surgically and antibiotic cream was applied to the wound edges to prevent infection. At least one week elapsed between surgery and recording.",
        "Recording environment. Postsurgically, rats were housed in pairs in an isolated room. Food and water were available ad libitum, ambient temperature was 21\u00b0 C., and humidity was 55%. At least 24 hrs prior to recording, they were placed in Nalgene containers (31\u00d731\u00d731 cm) with a wire-grid top, and entry to the room was prohibited during the day of recording except for dosing. The containers were placed on a rack with two shelves, 4 containers per shelf. Fluorescent overhead room lights were set to a 24 hr. light/dark cycle (on at 7 AM, off at 7 PM). Light levels inside the containers were 38 and 25 lux for the top and bottom shelves respectively. Background white-noise (68 db inside the containers) was present in the room to mask ambient sounds.",
        "Data acquisition. EEG and EMG signals were led via cables to a commutator (Plastics One) and then to pre-amplifiers (model 1700, A-M Systems, Carlsborg, Wash.). EEG and EMG signals were amplified (10K and 1K respectively) and bandpass filtered between 0.3 and 500 Hz for EEG and between 10 and 500 Hz for EMG. These signals were digitized at 128 samples per second using ICELUS sleep research software (M. Opp, U. Texas; see Opp, Physiology and Behavior 63:67-74, 1998, and Imeri, Mancia, and Opp, Neuroscience 92:745-749, 1999, incorporated by reference herein in their entirety) running under Labview 5.1 software and data acquisition hardware (PCI-MIO-16E-4; National Instruments, Austin, Tex.). On the day of dosing, data was recorded for 6 to 10 hours beginning at 11 AM.",
        "Drug administration and study design. Compounds were evaluated on groups of from 4 to 8 rats carried out over one or two separate test sessions. Each animal was tested with a different compound or vehicle for up to 10 weeks with at least 7 days between successive tests. A vehicle group was included in all experiments, and each animal received vehicle every 4th test. Test compounds were suspended in sterile 0.25% methylcellulose (pH=6.2; Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, Mich.) at 30 mg/mL. Although compounds can be administered at dosages greater than 100 mg/kg and are expected to be active under the selection criteria of data analysis, unless otherwise noted, compounds were administered at a single dose of 100 mg/kg. Dosing was carried out at noon, while the rats were predominantly asleep. Each rat was lifted out of its container, given an intraperitoneal injection in a volume of 5 mL/kg, and replaced. Dosing required approximately 30 sec per rat.",
        "Sleep/wake scoring. Sleep and wake activity were determined manually using ICELUS software. This program displays the EEG and EMG data in blocks of 6 sec along with the EEG frequency spectrum. Arousal state was scored as awake, rapid eye-movement (REM), or slow-wave or non-REM sleep (NREM) according to visual analysis of EEG frequency and amplitude characteristics and EMG activity (Opp and Krueger, 1994; Van Gelder, et al., 1991; Edgar, et al., 1991, 1997; Seidel, et al, 1995, incorporated by reference herein in their entirety). Essentially, waking activity consists of relatively low-amplitude EEG activity with relatively lower power in the frequency band from 0.5-6 Hz, accompanied by moderate to high level EMG activity. In a particular waking state (\u201ctheta-waking\u201d), EEG power can be relatively focused in the 6-9 Hz (theta) range, but significant EMG activity is always present. NREM sleep is characterized by relative high-amplitude EEG activity with relatively greater power in the low frequency band from 0.5-6 Hz, accompanied by little or no EMG activity. REM sleep is characterized by moderate and constant amplitude EEG focused in the theta (6-9 Hz) range, similar to waking theta, but with no EMG activity.",
        "Data analysis and statistics. Two basic outcome measures were used to ascertain whether a compound exhibited wake-enhancing activity. The first was the percent time spent awake for each 30 min period following dosing. The second was the total time spent awake in the first 3 hrs following dosing (3 hr AUC; maximum 180 min). For purposes of ascertaining activity of a test compound, wake activity values were compared against corresponding vehicle values. The vehicle values were of two types. The first type was the corresponding within-experiment vehicle, that is, a value for the vehicle group run concurrently with the test compound. A second \u201creference\u201d vehicle value consisted of the mean 3 hr AUC value calculated from 234 animals in 59 separate experiments carried out during the same time period as the evaluations of the test compounds (mean \u00b1SD =69.22\u00b120.12; 95% confidence limits=66.63-71.81). Two-tailed, unpaired t-tests were performed on the wake time values for drug versus vehicle treated animals, and compounds with p\u22660.05 were deemed significantly wake-promoting. A test compound was considered \u201cactive\u201d if it met one of the following three criteria.\n\n    \n    \n        (i) The 3 hr AUC value for the test compound was significantly greater (p\u22660.05) than the mean wake value for the reference vehicle group (N=234).\n        (ii) The 3 hr AUC value for the test compound was significantly greater (p\u22660.05) than the corresponding value for the vehicle group within the same experiment.\n        (iii) One or more of the half-hour wake time values from 0.5 to 2 hrs after dosing was significantly greater (p\u22660.05) in the test compound group than in the corresponding vehicle group within the same experiment.\n\nResults",
        "Compounds of the invention either have demonstrated or are expected to demonstrate utility for wake promoting activity.",
