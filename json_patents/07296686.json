        "The novel features believed to be characteristic of this invention are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. The invention itself, however, both as to its organization and method of operation, together with further objects and advantages thereof may best be understood by reference to the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings in which:",

        "U.S. Pat. No. 6,527,125 discloses a washing liquid distribution system employing spiral separators. Internally a plurality of dampening receivers receive the washing liquid into a top portion and provide a low kinetic energy liquid flow output onto the material being separated via the distribution system (FIG. 1).",
        "Control of the flow in many separation systems is accomplished via pet-cocks or valves in line with a supply hose. Because the outlet flow is to be very low, very small openings are provided. The disadvantage with this approach is that the openings are subject to clogging. A larger opening can be used to prevent clogging but the very low flow required to aid in separation results in an unstable liquid stream.",
        "In the present invention, the outlet from a receiver is via a small passageway formed in a removable and rotatable insert mounted in the bottom of the receiver. The inserts provide outlet holes that can be elongated in the vertical or horizontal or both directions.",
        "The inserts provide a means whereby the outlet stream can be directed towards the vertical divider that separates the separator trough from the concentrate trough with the stream having a horizontal component. The horizontal component of the flow can be directed upstream or downstream as desired in the circumstances. The small head developed within the insert provides for a stable flow stream. In addition, a larger outlet opening prevents clogging.",
        "With respect to the drawings, FIG. 2 illustrates receiver cup 10 having an inlet flow pipe 11. The specific construction of cup 10 may vary In the circumstances. In particular, horizontal pipe 12 (shown in broken line) may be provided to direct some of the incoming flow to another cup 10 as illustrated in Pat. No. 6,524,125, referenced hereinabove and incorporated herein in its entirety.",
        "The receiver cup 10 preferably is formed to provide a recess 13 into which the directional nozzle formed as an insert 14 will be mounted. Recess 13 provides a collection point for the incoming liquid to stabilize the liquid flow prior to exiting via horizontally disposed outlet opening 15. The diameter, shape, and angle with the horizontal of the outlet 15 vary with the specific separation application.",
        "The upper portion 16 of insert 14 is formed as a flange 17 that fits tightly into recess 13. The lower portion 18 is sized in height to create a head of approximately 1.0\u2033 to provide for a stable stream. The lower tapered portion 19 assists in directing the flow to outlet 15. Preferably, insert 14 has a pair of oppositely disposed flats 20 to allow the insert 14 to be rotated to position outlet 15 in the desired location.",
        "FIG. 2A illustrates the relationship of receiving cups 10 in accord with the present invention with respect to the spiral separator. With regard to the upper flight 30\u2032, an upper receiving cup 10 feeds water onto the flight 30\u2032 as does a lower cup 10. An outlet pipe 12 is not used in this particular configuration. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,524,125.",
        "The lower flight 30\u2033(preferably identical to upper flight 30\u2032) in FIG. 2A employs an upper receiving cup 10 that includes outlet pipe 12 to feed into a lower cup 10 which provides effluent only to the flight 30\u2033.",
        "Each receiving cup 10 is identical but may employ different nozzles such as those shown in FIGS. 2-8 as desired in a specific application. Incoming flow is directed by the hoses 26\u2032 and pipe 28\u2032 that may be of any appropriate size or number for the specific application.",
        "A side view of insert 14 is illustrated in FIG. 3. Flange 17 is formed to provide a smooth rounded inlet portion 21 to further stabilize the incoming flow downwardly through passageway 22 for greater stability of the outlet stream. The insert 14 is formed of material that is appropriate in the circumstances.",
        "With respect to FIG. 4, an alternate insert 23 having a rounded inlet 24 and flange 25 that fits tightly into a recess 13 of a cup 10. Flats 26 provide a means for grasping the insert 23 and rotating it to a desired position. The outlet 27 is a vertically elonoated generally rectangular slot that provides a horizontally directed flow.",
        "In FIG. 5, another embodiment of a directional nozzle in accord with the present invention is illustrated by insert 28. A rounded inlet 29 and flange 30 fits tightly into recess 13 of a cup 10. Flats 31 allow for rotation of the insert 28. Outlet 32 is formed as a curved slot to provide a horizontally directed outlet stream.",
        "In FIG. 6, another embodiment of a nozzle is illustrated by insert 33 having a rounded inlet 34 and flange 35 fits into recess 13. Flats 36 provide a grasping surface as before. Two oppositely disposed outlets 37 are provided to allow for two oppositely disposed horizontal outlet streams.",
        "In FIGS. 7 and 8, an embodiment of an insert 38 having outlets formed as angled slits 42 formed therein. Inlet 39, flange 40, and flats 41 are as before. The slits 42 provide a substantially horizontal fan-like outlet stream. Alternatively the slits 42 may be horizontal as shown by broken lines 43 or any angle between the approximately 45\u00b0 angle of slits 42 and slits 43.",
        "The particular insert chosen for a given application will depend on the material that is being processed as understood in the art.",
        "While the invention has been described with respect to certain specific embodiments, it will be appreciated that many modifications and changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is intended, therefore, by the appended claims to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention."
