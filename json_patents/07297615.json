        "This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2005-0040165, filed on May 13, 2005, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "Example embodiments of the present invention relate to a method of manufacturing a silicon nanowire film, and more particularly, to a silicon nanowire substrate having a structure in which a silicon nanowire film having a fine line-width is formed on a substrate, and a method of manufacturing the same, and a method of manufacturing a thin film transistor using the same.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Poly crystalline silicon (poly-Si) may be applied to various electronic devices, for example, flat display devices and solar cells, as a result of having a higher mobility than amorphous silicon (a-Si). However, poly crystalline silicon has lower mobility and uniformity than single crystalline silicon. Single crystalline silicon may be useful in a system on panel (SOP) structure in which a system is formed on the display panel itself, and may have a mobility of more than 300 cm2/Vs. Single crystalline silicon allows the manufacture of improved quality switching devices required for higher performance display devices.",
        "Recently, to comply with stricter miniaturization requirements and higher performance devices, nano scale devices have been developed. To manufacture nano scale devices, nanowire forming techniques have been developed. A nanowire may be defined as an ultra fine line having a cross-sectional diameter of a few nanometers to a few tens of nanometers. Nanowires may be utilized in many fields, for example, laser, transistors, memories and chemical detecting sensors. Naowire materials may include carbon nanotubes (CNT), CdTe, ZnO2, and/or SiGe.",
        "Methods of manufacturing nanowires may be difficult and complicated. A crystal growth inducing method may be used to grow nanowires, but this method may only provide nanowire crystals grown perpendicular to a substrate, and a nanowire grown by such a method may have many impurities. In some cases, location control of the nanowire is needed, which conventional methods may have difficulty providing. Unlike crystal growth inducing methods that uses a catalyst, a nanowire may also be manufactured by lithography, in order to control their horizontal location. However, the conventional lithographic resolution limit is approximately 30 nm. Therefore, the manufacture of a nanowire having a line-width of 30 nm or less is difficult.",

As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, may be expected. Thus, example embodiments of the invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but may include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle may have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient (e.g., of implant concentration) at its edges rather than an abrupt change from an implanted region to a non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation may take place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes do not necessarily illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and do not limit the scope of the present invention.",
