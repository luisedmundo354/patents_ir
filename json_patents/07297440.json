        "This application is based on applications No.2002-317689 filed in Japan on Oct. 31, 2002, the content of which is incorporated hereinto by reference.",
        "1. Technical Field",
        "The present invention relates to a battery pack and a process for the production thereof.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "The related art battery pack is arranged such that an elementary battery cell is received in an outer case. The outer case insulates and protects the metal case of the cell. This battery pack is prepared by receiving an elementary battery cell in an outer case prepared by molding a plastic. This structure requires many producing steps that add to the production cost. In recent years, a production method has been developed which comprises inserting a cell in an outer case at a step of forming an outer case. This battery pack is disclosed in Patent Reference JP-A-2000-315483, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference. This battery pack is prepared by temporarily fixing a battery core pack having a holder and a cell connected to each other in a mold for forming a molded resin product which is an outer case, and then inserting and fixing the core pack in the outer case thus formed. In order to prepare this battery pack, it is not necessary that the core pack be received in a separately formed outer case during assembly. Therefore, this battery pack can be mass-produced efficiently.",
        "However, this battery pack is disadvantageous in that the actual production thereof adds to production cost, it takes much time to accurately fix the battery core pack temporarily in the predetermined position and the production yield is reduced. The reason why the production cost rises is that a complicated mold allowing easy release of the outer case thus formed and a mechanism for driving this mold are required in addition to the necessity of accurately fixing the core pack temporarily in the predetermined position in such a manner that the core pack is not moved. Further, the reason why it takes much time to temporarily fix the core pack is that the core pack must be certainly attached to the open mold at a predetermined position. Moreover, the reason why the production yield is reduced is that the plastic to be molded into the outer case penetrates unnecessary portions under injection pressure or the molten plastic cannot be accurately injected into desired portions. Further, the method which comprises inserting the battery core pack partly in the mold at the step of forming the outer case to produce a battery pack is disadvantageous in that it is difficult to cover the surface of the cell by the outer case. In particular, it is extremely difficult to cover the surface of the cell by a thin outer case. This is because the thickness of the cell has an error that differs from position to position. For example, a thin battery cannot have a completely flat surface on the-both sides. For example, a thin battery which is bent such that it protrudes at the center thereof is thicker at the center thereof than at the edge thereof. When a molten plastic is then injected into the mold for forming the outer case for covering both sides of the battery with such a cell temporarily fixed in the forming chamber of the mold, the resulting outer case is thinner at the position corresponding to the thick portion of the thin battery or the surface of the thin battery is partly exposed to the exterior of the outer case, producing defectives. It may be thought likely that this trouble can be eliminated by forming a thicker outer case for covering both sides of the thin battery. However, it is actually not possible to form a thicker outer case. This is because the thicker the outer case is, the thicker is the entire battery pack. The production of thin batteries requires an extreme technique for raising the charge capacity while minimizing the external size. The cell thus produced should not be received in a thick outer case to form a battery pack having a large external size. Therefore, in the battery pack produced by inserting a battery core pack in an outer case, the thin battery is not insulated by the outer case on both sides thereof. A label is bonded to the both sides of the cell so that the cell is insulated. The bonding of such a label requires the cost of the label and the cost of bonding the label, adding to the production cost.",
        "The invention has been worked out for the purpose of eliminating these disadvantages of the related art battery pack. An important object of the invention is to provide a battery pack which can be mass-produced efficiently in a high yield at a reduced cost using a simple producing apparatus and a process for the production thereof.",
        "Another important object of the invention is to provide a battery pack which can be covered and insulated on both sides thereof by a thin plastic protective layer having a uniform thickness even if the external size of the cell has an error.",
        "The above and further objects and features of the invention will more fully be apparent from the following detailed description with accompanying drawings.",
        "The battery pack of the invention comprises a plastic protective layer bonded to the surface of a cell. This plastic protective layer is provided by curing a polyurethane emulsion spread over the surface of the cell. This polyurethane emulsion comprises a reaction product obtained by emulsifying and dispersing an intermediate product produced from a compound A made of an organic diisocyanate, a compound B1 made of a polyol mixture having not smaller than at least 2.05 functional groups on the average and a compound B2 having one hydrophilic center and at least two active hydrogen groups in water.",
        "In the battery pack of the invention, a holder having an output terminal attached thereto at a predetermined position can be fixed to the end of the cell. In this battery pack, with the periphery of the holder following the periphery of the cell, the polyurethane emulsion is spread over the area extending from the periphery of the cell to the periphery of the holder so that a plastic protective layer is bonded to the periphery of the cell and the holder and the holder and the cell are connected to each other at their border with the plastic protective layer. The holder can be bonded and fixed to the cell. The holder may be also fixed to the cell with a rivet. A protective element may be provided so as to be interposed between the holder and the cell.",
        "The compound B1, which is a polyol mixture the average number of functional groups of which is not smaller than 2.05, can be produced from a polyol mixture of a bifunctional polyol and a trifunctional or higher polyol. The compound B1 preferably is a polyol mixture of a bifunctional polyol and a trifunctional polyol the average number of functional groups of which is from 2.05 to 2.6. The compound B1 is more preferably arranged such that the molecular weight of the trifunctional polyol is smaller than the molecular weight of the bifunctional polyol.",
        "The polyurethane emulsion may comprise a pigment incorporated therein. This pigment may be a carbon black. Further, the battery pack of the invention allows the polyurethane emulsion having a carbon black incorporated therein to be irradiated with a laser beam so that the carbon black undergoes sublimation and discoloration to effect display of letters, patterns, signs, etc. Moreover, the battery pack of the invention may a thixotropic material incorporated in the polyurethane emulsion.",
        "The process for the production of a battery pack of the invention comprises spreading a polyurethane emulsion comprising a reaction product obtained by emulsifying and dispersing an intermediate product produced from a compound A made of an organic diisocyanate, a compound B1 made of a polyol mixture having not smaller than at least 2.05 average functional groups and a compound B2 having one hydrophilic center and at least two active hydrogen groups in water over the surface of a cell, and then curing the polyurethane emulsion thus spread to coat the surface of the cell with the plastic protective layer.",
        "In the process for the production of a battery pack of the invention, the cell can be dipped in the polyurethane emulsion to coat the surface of the cell with the polyurethane emulsion. Further, in the process for the production of a battery pack of the invention, the polyurethane emulsion can be spread over the surface of the cell using a roller.",
        "Moreover, the process for the production of a battery pack of the invention comprises attaching to the end of the cell a holder having an output terminal attached thereto at a predetermined position and the periphery of which follows the periphery of the cell, and then spreading a polyurethane emulsion over the area extending from the periphery of the cell to the periphery of the holder so that a plastic protective layer is bonded to the periphery of the cell and the holder and the holder and the cell are connected to each other at their border with the plastic protective layer.",
        "The battery pack described above is advantageous in that a high quality battery pack can be efficiently mass-produced at a reduced cost in a high yield using a simple production apparatus. This is because a one-pack type polyurethane emulsion showing unique physical properties is spread over the surface of the cell to provide a plastic protective layer. The polyurethane emulsion which is spread over the surface of the cell to form a plastic protective layer comprises a reaction product obtained by emulsifying and dispersing an intermediate product produced from a compound A made of an organic diisocyanate, a compound B1 made of a polyol mixture having not smaller than at least 2.05 functional groups on the average and a compound B2 having one hydrophilic center and at least two active hydrogen groups in water. The plastic protective layer made of a polyurethane emulsion is formed by spreading the polyurethane emulsion over the surface of the cell and curing the polyurethane emulsion. In this manner, the plastic protective layer is bonded to the surface of the cell so firmly that it cannot be peeled off the surface of the cell, thereby covering and protecting the surface of the cell. Further, this plastic protective layer forms an extremely tough film that protects the cell. Therefore, the battery pack having this structure can be efficiently mass-produced using a simple apparatus for spreading the polyurethane emulsion over the surface of the cell without using a complicated mold or other apparatus as with the related art packed batteries which are produced by inserting the cell partly in an outer case. Further, since the plastic protective layer formed by spreading and curing a polyurethane emulsion acts as an outer case which protects the cell, it is not necessary that the cell be received in a separately molded plastic case as in the related art packed batteries. Accordingly, the battery pack described above is advantageous in that it can be simply and easily mass-produced at a reduced cost while protecting securely the surface of the cell by the plastic protective layer.",
        "The battery pack described above is further advantageous in that even when the outer shape of the cell has an error, the surface of the cell can be coated and insulated with a thin plastic protective layer to a uniform thickness. This is because a polyurethane emulsion is spread over the surface of the cell and cured so that a plastic protective layer is bonded to the surface of the cell. In order to provide this plastic protective layer in this arrangement, the cell can be dipped in the polyurethane emulsion or coated with the polyurethane emulsion in such a manner that a layer is formed to a uniform thickness. In this manner, the plastic protective layer forms a tough film that is bonded to the surface of the cell so firmly that it cannot be peeled of f the surface of the cell, making it possible to insulate certainly the surface of the cell with a tough insulating film.",
        "Moreover, the process for the production of a battery pack of the invention comprises a core pack assembly step of attaching to the end of the cell a holder having an output terminal attached thereto at a predetermined position and the periphery of which follows the periphery of the cell to form a battery core pack and a step of applying a stress to an adhesive solution comprising a thixotropic material incorporated therein to form a liquid adhesive and dipping at least a part of the holder and the cell in the liquid adhesive to spread the adhesive solution over the area extending from the periphery of the cell to the periphery of the holder so that the surface of the cell is coated with a plastic protective layer formed by curing the adhesive solution and the holder is connected to the cell with the plastic protective layer.",
        "The adhesive solution may be a polyurethane-based adhesive, acrylic adhesive, epoxy-based adhesive or silicon-based adhesive. Further, the adhesive solution may be a polyurethane emulsion comprising a reaction product obtained by emulsifying and dispersing an intermediate product produced from a compound A made of an organic diisocyanate, a compound B1 made of a polyol mixture having not smaller than at least 2.05 functional groups on the average and a compound B2 having one hydrophilic center and at least two active hydrogen groups in water.",
        "The process for the production of a battery pack described above is advantageous in that a battery pack can be efficiently mass-produced at a reduced cost in a high yield using a simple production apparatus and even when the outer shape of the cell has an error, the surface of the cell can be coated and insulated with a thin plastic protective layer to a uniform thickness. This is because this process comprises applying a stress to an adhesive solution comprising a thixotropic material incorporated therein to form a liquid adhesive and dipping at least a part of the holder and the cell in the liquid adhesive to spread the adhesive solution over the area extending from the periphery of the cell to the periphery of the holder so that the surface of the cell is coated with a plastic protective layer formed by curing the adhesive solution and the holder is connected to the cell with the plastic protective layer.",

        "The battery pack shown in the perspective view of FIG. 1 and the exploded perspective view of FIG. 2 comprises a holder 4 having an output terminal 3 fixed to a cell 2 at the end thereof having a protruding electrode portion 2B. Referring to this battery pack, a core pack 5 comprising the holder 4 attached to the cell 2 is dipped in an adhesive solution 20 so that the cell 2 and the holder 4 are coated with the adhesive solution 20. The adhesive solution 20 is then cured to form a plastic protective layer 1 which covers the surface of the cell 2. The core pack 5 of the battery is dipped upright in the adhesive solution 20 with the cell 2 disposed down and the holder 4 disposed upside as shown in FIG. 3 so that the surface of the cell 2 and the holder 4 are coated with the adhesive solution 20. The cell 2 is coated with the adhesive solution 20 on the entire surface thereof exposed on the surface of the battery pack. In the case of the battery pack shown, the cell 2 is coated with the adhesive solution 20 on the periphery and the lower surface thereof. The holder 4 is coated with the adhesive solution 20 on the periphery thereof. Since the battery pack shown has terminal windows 6 provided on the side of the holder 4, the adhesive solution 20 is spread over the cell so that the adhesive solution 20 doesn't close the terminal windows 6.",
        "A perspective view of the holder 4 is shown in FIGS. 4 and 5. FIG. 5 is a perspective diagram of the holder 4 of FIG. 4 as viewed from the other side. The holder 4 shown in these drawings comprises a first holder 4A, a second holder 4B fitted in the first holder 4A and output terminals 3 fixed so as to be interposed between the first holder 4A and the second holder 4B as shown in the exploded perspective views of FIGS. 6 and 7. FIG. 7 is a perspective diagram of the holder 4 of FIG. 6 as viewed from the other side. Further, FIGS. 8 and 9 each are a perspective view illustrating how the output terminals 3 are attached to the second holder 4B. FIG. 9 is a perspective diagram of the second holder 4B of FIG. 8 as viewed from the other side.",
        "The first holder 4A and the second holder 4B are molded plastic products, and the output terminals 3 are obtained by press-molding a metal sheet. The holder 4 is shaped such that the periphery of the first holder 4A disposed outside follows the periphery of the cell 2. The periphery of the holder 4 is fully or substantially flush with the periphery of the cell 2. Referring to the first holder 4A shown, the size of the attaching portion 4a, which is a part of the periphery that is coated with the adhesive solution 20 to provide a plastic protective layer 1 thereon, is slightly smaller than the size of the non-attaching portion 4b on which the plastic protective layer 1 is not provided. The holder 4 can have the plastic protective layer 1 bonded thereto without causing exfoliation of the plastic protective layer 1. This is because the plastic protective layer 1 can be provided in such an arrangement that it doesn't extend from the level of the non-attaching portion 4b of the holder 4. Also, the non-attaching portion 4b of the holder may by flush with the surface of the plastic protective layer 1.",
        "The first holder 4A is obtained by molding a plastic in such an arrangement that the side wall 7 of a cylinder is closed at one end and opened at the other. The side wall 7 is closed on the side thereof opposed to the cell 2 and opened on the other side. The side wall 7 is formed in a cylindrical shape following the periphery of the cell 2 and its periphery is substantially flush with that of the cell 2. The first holder 4A has terminal windows 6 provided therein. Each of the terminal windows 6 is an opening in which the power terminal of an electric appliance is inserted to make electrical connection to the output terminals 3 and have the output terminal 3 provided therein. The holder 4 has output terminals 3 provided thereinside to allow the insertion of the power terminals of an electrical appliance into the interior thereof, making it possible to prevent the output terminals 3 of the battery pack from being stained. Further, the contact of metal pieces with the output terminals 3 causing short-circuiting can be prevented. Moreover, since the output terminals 3 are provided in the holder 4, stain or change of properties can be prevented.",
        "The second holder 4B is obtained by molding a plastic into an outer shape that can be fitted in the first holder 4A. The second holder 4B has a fixing portion 8 at which it is fixed to the cell 2. The second holder 48 shown has a fixing portion 8 provided at both ends thereof. The arrangement in which the fixing portion 8 is fixed to the cell 2 is shown in FIGS. 10 to 13. The second holder 4B of FIGS. 10 and 11 is fixed to the cell 2 by bonding the fixing portion 8 to the cell 2. The cell 2 has a connecting indentation 9 provided at the end of the electrode for bonding the fixing portion 8 of the holder 4 to the cell 2. The cell 2 shown has a ring groove-shaped connecting indentation 9 provided at the end of the electrode. The connecting indentation 9 is undercut in such an arrangement that the opening is narrower than the bottom. The second holder 4B has a connecting protrusion 10 provided at the fixing portion 8 which is fitted in the connecting indentation 9. The second holder 4B is fixed to the cell 2 by inserting the connecting protrusion 10 provided at the fixing portion 8 into the connecting indentation 9 of the cell 2 and then bonding them to each other.",
        "Further, the second holder 124B shown in FIGS. 12 and 13 is fixed to the cell 122 at a fixing portion 128 with a rivet 1211. The cell 122 to which the second holder 124B is fixed with the rivet 1211, also has a connecting indentation 129 provided at the end of the electrode. The connecting indentation 129, too, is undercut in such an arrangement that the opening is narrower than the bottom. The rivet 1211 comprises a cylindrical sheath 1211A which is inserted in the connecting indentation 129 of the cell 122 and a press-fit pin 1211B which is inserted in the interior of the sheath 1211A. The sheath 1211A comprises a lower part having an outer shape substantially the same as the inner shape of the connecting indentation 129 which gradually increases in wall thickness toward the lower end thereof and has an axial slit 1211a provided at the lower part thereof.

The press-fit pin 1211B thus pressed in expands the lower end of the sheath 1211A in the undercut connecting indentation 129 so that the sheath 1211A cannot be pulled out of the connecting indentation 129.",
        "After fixing the second holders 4B and 124B to the elementary batteries 2 and 122, the first holders 4A and 124A are then connected to the second holders 4B and 124B, respectively.

The first holders 4A and 124A attached at this position are bonded and fixed to the second holders 4B and 124B, respectively. Alternatively, the first holders 4A and 124A may be ultrasonically welded and fixed to the second holders 4B and 124B, respectively. The battery pack comprising the first holders 4A and 124A fixed to the second holders 4B and 124B and the second holders 4B and 124B fixed to the elementary batteries 2 and 122, respectively, can have the holders 4 and 124 firmly fixed to the cell at a predetermined position.

The output terminal 3 shown in the perspective view of FIGS. 6 and 7 comprises an elastic clamping portion 3A which is connected to the power terminal of an electrical appliance and a connecting portion 3B which is connected to the cell 2 or the protective element 14. The elastic clamping portion 3A has a pair of elastic members for elastically clamping the power terminal from both the sides thereof. The elastic clamping portion 3A is fitted in the fitting indentation 13 of the second holder 4B so that it is attached at a predetermined position. The second holder 4B has a fitting indentation 13 provided therein for fitting the elastic clamping portion 3A of the output terminal 3 therein. The fitting indentation 13 is disposed at a position opposed to the terminal windows 6 of the first holder 4A so that the power terminal of an electrical appliance inserted in the holder 4 through the terminal windows 6 are electrically connected to the elastic clamping portion 3A.",

Further, in order to weld the connecting portion 3B to the cell 2 or the protective element 14, the second holder 4B has through-holes 15 provided therein. The second holder 4B is arranged such that an electrode for welding is inserted in the through-holes 15 with the connecting portion 3B in contact with the electrode or protective element 14 to connect the connecting portion 3B to the electrode or the protective element 14. The output terminal 3 is adapted to connect the second holder 4B to the cell 2. This is because the connecting portion 3B is connected to the cell 2 or the protective element 14 and the elastic clamping portion 3A is fitted in the fitting indentation 13. The second holder 4B having such an arrangement is set at a predetermined position on the cell 2 with the output terminals 3 attached thereto.

As such a cell there may be also used a cylindrical battery or prismatic battery. Further, a plurality of batteries may be used in series or in parallel. In the battery pack having a holder attached to the end of the electrode, the periphery of the holder and the cell are fully or substantially flush with each other regardless of the shape of the cell to establish an arrangement that the periphery of the holder follows the periphery of the cell.",

The cell 2 shown has a protruding electrode 2B provided at the central portion of the sealing plate 16 and a safety valve 17 provided at a position apart from the protruding electrode 2B. The cell also may have a safety valve incorporated in the protruding electrode. The safety valve 17 opens when the inner pressure in the battery 2 exceeds a predetermined value. When the safety valve 17 thus opens, gas or the like is discharged from the interior of the battery 2 to inhibit the rise of the inner pressure in the outer case 2A.

However, the battery pack of the invention may have a circuit board incorporated in the holder so that a battery protective circuit realized by an electronic circuit can be packaged in the circuit board. The protective circuit packaged in the circuit board can detect overcharge, overdischarge, overcurrent, etc. to cut electric current and, when the battery temperature exceeds a predetermined value, cuts electric current to protect the cell. The battery pack having a protective circuit packaged therein can be free of protective element. This is because the protective circuit protects the battery.",
        "To the cell 2 are attached the protective element 14, the output terminal 3 and the holder 4 to produce a battery core pack 5. The core pack 5 is dipped in the adhesive solution as shown in FIG. 3 so that the cell 2 and the holder 4 are coated with the plastic protective layer 1. As the adhesive solution 20 there is preferably used a polyurethane emulsion. This is because the plastic protective layer 1 formed by curing such a polyurethane emulsion shows a strong adhesion to the cell 2 and the holder 4 as well as a high toughness and an excellent impact resistance. However, the adhesive solution 20 for forming the plastic protective layer 1 does not necessarily need to be a polyurethane emulsion. For example, a polyurethane-based adhesive such as a solvent type one-pack polyurethane and two-pack polyurethane, an acrylic adhesive, an epoxy-based adhesive, a silicon-based adhesive, etc. may be used.",
        "The polyurethane emulsion to be used as the plastic protective layer 1 is produced from a compound A which is an organic diisocyanate, a compound B1 made of a polyol mixture and a compound B2 having one hydrophilic center and at least two active hydrogen groups. The polyurethane emulsion thus produced is a crosslinkable polyurethane emulsion comprising as compound B1 a polyol mixture having at least 2.05 functional groups on the average that forms an extremely good plastic protective layer 1. The plastic protective layer 1 thus formed is extremely excellent in various physical properties such as film hardness, film strength, water resistance, hot water resistance and alcohol resistance.",
        "In other words, the polyurethane emulsion comprises a reaction product obtained by emulsifying and dispersing an intermediate product produced from a compound A made of an organic diisocyanate, a compound B1 made of a polyol mixture having not smaller than at least 2.05 functional groups on the average and a compound B2 having one hydrophilic center and at least two active hydrogen groups in water.",
        "The compound B1, which is a polyol mixture having not smaller than 2.05 functional groups on the average, can be produced from a polyol mixture of a bifunctional polyol and a trifunctional or higher polyol. The compound B1 is preferably a polyol mixture of a bifunctional polyol and a trifunctional polyol the average number of functional groups of which is from 2.05 to 2.6. When the average number of functional groups falls below 2.05, the resulting cured product exhibits deteriorated physical properties, making it impossible to realize excellent properties. On the contrary, when the average number of functional groups exceeds 2.6, emulsification and dispersion cannot be effected under desirable conditions. Further, the compound B1, which is a polyol mixture of a bifunctional polyol and a trifunctional polyol, is preferably arranged such that the molecular weight of the trifunctional polyol is smaller than the molecular weight of the bifunctional polyol and the molecular weight of the bifunctional polyol and the trifunctional polyol are from 700 to 3,000 from 400 to 1,200, respectively. The reason why as the trifunctional polyol there is used one having a small molecular weight is that the polyol mixture can be dispersed and emulsified under desirable conditions. Referring further to the polyol mixture, an \u03b5-caprolactone-basedpolyol is used as the trifunctional polyol by way of example.",
        "The polyurethane emulsion may comprise a pigment incorporated therein to adjust the color of the plastic protective layer 1. The pigment is preferably mixed with the polyol mixture which is the compound B1. Further, as the pigment to be mixed with the polyol mixture which is the compound B1 there is preferably used an organic pigment. As the pigment there may be used a carbon black. However, the polyurethane emulsion may also comprise an inorganic pigment incorporated therein. Alternatively, the pigment may be added to the polyurethane emulsion having a reaction product emulsified in water rather than to the polyol mixture.",
        "The polyurethane emulsion comprises the compounds B1 and B2 incorporated therein in an amount of preferably from 0.45 to 1.02 equivalents, more preferably from 0.50 to 0.95 equivalents, most preferably from 0.70 to 0.93 per equivalent of the compound A. When the added amount of the compounds B1 and B2 per equivalent of the compound A is too small, the resulting reaction product has a reduced molecular weight that deteriorates the physical properties of the plastic protective layer 1. On the contrary, when the added amount of the compounds B1 and B2 per equivalent of the compound A is too great, the resulting reaction product cannot be emulsified and dispersed under desirable conditions.",
        "The aforementioned polyurethane emulsion is cured to form the plastic protective layer 1. The plastic protective layer 1 can form a coat having a tensile break strength of not smaller than 800 kg/cm2 and a pencil hardness of not lower than 2H. The tensile break strength and the pencil hardness of the plastic protective layer 1 can be adjusted to a range of from 800 to 1,500 kg/cm2 and a range of from 3H to 5H, respectively, by adjusting the formulation of the starting materials of the compounds A, B1 and B2 or their mixing ratios.",
        "The polyurethane emulsion may comprise a thixotropic material incorporated therein so that it can be efficiently spread to form the plastic protective layer 1. This is because the adhesive solution 20 such as polyurethane emulsion having a thixotropic material incorporated therein doesn't run down as droplet toward the lower end of the core pack 5 when the core pack 5 is dipped in the adhesive solution 20 and then withdrawn therefrom. The polyurethane emulsion having a thixotropic material incorporated therein becomes liquid when given stress such as vibration. The core pack 5 is dipped in the polyurethane emulsion to which stress has been applied so that it is coated with the polyurethane emulsion on the surface thereof. When the core pack 5 thus coated is then withdrawn from the polyurethane emulsion, no stress is applied to the polyurethane emulsion thus spread over the surface of the core pack 5. Thus, the polyurethane emulsion doesn't drip from the core pack 5. As the thixotropic material, finely divided synthetic silica is used. However, it goes without saying that as the thixotropic material to be incorporated in the adhesive solution 20 there may be used one other than finely divided synthetic silica. The amount of the finely divided synthetic silica to be incorporated as thixotropic material in the polyurethane emulsion is preferably from 3 to 20 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the components contained in the polyurethane emulsion excluding water content.",
        "Further, the plastic protective layer 1 of polyurethane emulsion may comprise a carbon black pigment incorporated therein and then be spread. The coat layer thus formed is then irradiated with a laser beam to cause sublimation of carbon black.",
        "In some detail, the aforementioned polyurethane emulsion is prepared as follows. The polyurethane emulsion comprises a reaction product obtained by self-emulsifying and dispersing an intermediate product comprising the following components (1) to (3) in water.\n\n    (1) Compound A . . . Compound A made of an organic diisocyanate\n    (2) Compound B1 . . . Polyol mixture having greater than at least 2.05 functional groups on the average\n    (3) Compound B2 . . . Compound having one hydrophilic center and at least two active hydrogen groups",
        "The polyol mixture of compound B1 is obtained by mixing a bifunctional polyol with a bifunctional to tetrafunctional polyol, preferably a trifunctional polyol. The polyol mixture having not smaller than 2.05 functional groups on the average is obtained by mixing a bifunctional polyol with a trifunctional or higher polyol. Referring to the reason why the average number of functional groups in the polyol mixture of compound B1 is predetermined to be not smaller than 2.05, when the average number of functional groups falls below this value, the resulting reaction product of polyurethane emulsion cannot be sufficiently polymerized. The plastic protective layer 1 formed by curing such a reaction product is left uncured. Even if cured, the resulting coat layer leaves something to be desired in film hardness, film strength, water resistance, hot water resistance and alcohol resistance, exhibits a poor heat resistance and remains viscous on the surface thereof to disadvantage.",
        "Supposing that the number of parts of the bifunctional polyol to be mixed is x and the number of parts of the trifunctional polyol to be mixed is y, the average number of functional groups in the polyol mixture obtained by mixing the bifunctional polyol with the trifunctional polyol is calculated by the following equation.\n\nAverage number of functional groups=(2x+3y)/(x+y)",

When the molecular weight of the bifunctional polyol is not greater than 500, the resulting intermediate product exhibits too high a viscosity and thus can be difficultly emulsified. When the molecular weight of the bifunctional polyol is not smaller than 4,000, it is disadvantageous in that the resulting compound B1 exhibits a deteriorated compatibility with other components, particularly the compound B2. Further, the resulting coat layer exhibits a deteriorated film strength and film hardness as well as a deteriorated heat resistance to disadvantage.",

Particularly preferred among these monomolecular polyols are glycerin and trimethanolamine. The molecular weight of the monomolecular polyol is from 300 to 1,000, preferably from 500 to 800. When the molecular weight of the monomolecular polyol is not greater than 300, the resulting intermediate product exhibits too high a viscosity and thus can be difficultly emulsified.

In order to enhance the weathering resistance and water resistance of the coat layer dried, neutralizing agents having a high volatility are preferred such as trimethylamine and triethylamine. These neutralizing agents may be used singly or in admixture of two or more thereof. The amount of the neutralizing agents to be used is from 0.3 to 1 mol per mol of the compound B2.

        "The amount of the compound B1 to be incorporated is, e.g., from 0.3 to 0.7 equivalents per equivalent of the organic diisocyanate which is the compound A. However, referring to the ratio of equivalent of active hydrogen group in the compounds B1 and B2 to isocyanate group in the organic diisocyanate which is the compound A, i.e., active hydrogen group to isocyanate group, the total amount of the compounds B1 and B2 is adjusted such that the amount of active hydrogen group is from 0.45 to 1.02 equivalents, preferably from 0.5 to 0.95 equivalents per equivalent of isocyanate group. When the amount of active hydrogen group is not greater than 0.45 equivalents per equivalent of isocyanate group, the resulting polyurethane emulsion exhibits a reduced molecular weight that deteriorates the film properties and strength. On the contrary, when the amount of active hydrogen group is not smaller than 1.02 equivalents per equivalent of isocyanate group, the presence of excessive amount of active hydrogen group is not significant. Further, when the rate of addition of active hydrogen group to the reaction system is too high, the molecular weight of the polyurethane emulsion is reduced to disadvantage.",
        "When the amount of active hydrogen group is close to 0.95 equivalents per equivalent of isocyanate group, the resulting intermediate product shows a sudden viscosity rise but can be prevented from gelling. This is because the remarkable viscosity rise is accompanied by the inhibition of the progress of reaction of the active reactive group by which the polymer is terminated. This reaction may be effected in an organic solvent compatible with water. Water is then added to the reaction solution. Thereafter, the organic solvent may be removed. The resulting reaction product may be forcedly dispersed directly in water to obtain a polyurethane emulsion.",

When the amount of water is not greater than 100 parts by weight, the intermediate product gels, making it impossible to obtain a well-emulsified polyurethane emulsion. The polyurethane emulsion thus obtained is then allowed to stand at ordinary temperature for 12 hours or longer so that it is stabilized. When the polyurethane emulsion is allowed to stand under these conditions, the reaction of the remaining isocyanate group is completed and carbon gas which is a by-product is released. Accordingly, the polyurethane emulsion which has been allowed to stand for a predetermined period of time can form a plastic protective layer 1 free of foam, making it possible to provide an ideal coat layer. The polyurethane emulsion comprising a solvent may be subjected to desolvation in vacuo.",
        "The polyurethane emulsion thus obtained exhibits a resin concentration of not greater than 40% and a liquid viscosity of not greater than 800 cps at 23\u00b0 C. When apolyurethane emulsion having a higher resin concentration is needed, the polyurethane emulsion may be subjected to dehydration at a higher degree of vacuum to increase the resin concentration and liquid viscosity before use.",
        "Examples of the organic solvent to be used in the polyurethane emulsion include ketone-based solvents such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone, ester-based solvents such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate and isobutyl acetate, aromatic solvents such as toluene and xylene, and chlorine-based solvents such as methylene chloride. Other examples of the organic solvent include organic solvents inert to isocyanate such as dioxane, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone and tetrahydrofurane. Nothing can be better than using the polyurethane emulsion free of solvent. However, if any solvent is used, ketone-based solvents are desirable because they are water-soluble and can be easily removed in vacuo.",

The core pack 145 and the cell 142 are rotated in contact with the coating roller 1422 so that the polyurethane emulsion attached to the surface of the coating roller 1422 is transferred to the surface of the core pack 145 and the cell 142. The method for spreading the polyurethane emulsion over the cell 142 or the core pack 145 in this structure is suitable for the case where the cell 142 is a cylindrical battery. While the apparatus of FIG. 14 is arranged such that the coating roller 1422 is dipped in the polyurethane emulsion, the polyurethane emulsion may be transferred from a transferring roller 1524 dipped in the polyurethane emulsion to a coating roller 1522 so that the polyurethane emulsion is spread over the surface of the cell 152 or the core pack 155 as shown in FIG. 15. The apparatus of FIG. 15 is arranged such that the transferring roller 1524 and the coating roller 1522 are rotated without slipping off each other to transfer the polyurethane emulsion from the transferring roller 1524 to the coating roller 1522. This apparatus allows the polyurethane emulsion to be spread to a uniform thickness without using any scraper. This is because when the polyurethane emulsion is transferred from the transferring roller 1524 to the coating roller 1522, the layer of polyurethane emulsion is adjusted uniform. In these drawings, the reference numerals 1420 and 1520 each indicate an adhesive solution.",
        "For the measurement of tensile break strength of the polyurethane emulsion (resin concentration: 40%) thus obtained, the polyurethane emulsion may be spread over a plastic film in the following manner. In some detail, the polyurethane emulsion is spread over a PET film to a thickness of 150 \u03bcm, dried at room temperature for 12 hours, and then dried at 80\u00b0 C. for 3 hours to obtain a light yellow transparent film-like plastic protective layer having a thickness of about 60 \u03bcm.
