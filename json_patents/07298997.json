        "This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. JP2004-310705 filed on Oct. 26, 2004, which is incorporated hereinto by reference.",
        "The present invention relates to a color image forming apparatus of the electro-photographic method.",
        "For example, in a color image forming apparatus of the electro-photographic method used in copying machines, printers, etc., normally, primary toner images of different colors are formed on a plurality of photoreceptors, these primary toner images are transferred successively onto an intermediate transfer body by primary image transfer thereby forming a color toner image, and subsequently a secondary image transfer is made of this color toner image onto a transfer medium, and thereafter, the color image is formed by fixing the color toner image on the transfer material by carrying out a fixing operation.",
        "Since the potential on the intermediate transfer body is determined by the amount of toner adhered within a specific area, the electric surface potential of the part of the intermediate transfer body of a color image forming apparatus in which toners of several colors have been superimposed will be larger than the electrostatic surface potential of the area in which toner of only one color is adhered, there is the problem that, when the potential distribution is broad in a color toner image formed in this manner, image defects occur in the obtained color image as a result of various transfer defects occurring in the secondary image transfer process.",
        "Methods have been proposed in order to solve the above problem, such as, for example, carrying out pre-charging operation on the color toner image prior to secondary image transfer thereby applying an electric charge with the same polarity as that of the toner potential to the color toner image before the secondary image transfer process and thus raising the potential of the part of the color toner image at which the potential is excessively low to within a range appropriate for carrying out secondary image transfer (see, for example, Patent Document 1 to Patent Document 4).",
        "However, if only the pre-charging operation is made prior to the secondary image transfer, it is not possible to lower the potential of the part of the color toner image at which the potential is excessively high to within a range appropriate for carrying out the secondary image transfer, and as a result of leakage of electrical charge during the secondary image transfer process caused by the presence of parts of the color image toner at which the potential is excessively high image defects are generated such as streaks of discharges, etc. In order to suppress the generation of such discharge streaks, although it is effective to lower the transfer voltage applied during the secondary image transfer process, reducing the transfer voltage is likely to cause image defects in the obtained image such as uneven density or toner splashes due to the presence of parts in the color toner image at which the potential is excessively high.",

        "The present invention was made based on the above current state of the art, and the purpose of the present invention is to provide a color image forming apparatus in which the generation of image defects such as uneven density or toner splashes are suppressed and good color images are obtained irrespective of the amount of adhesion of the toner constituting the color toner image.",
        "A color image forming apparatus according to the present invention is constituted by a plurality of photoreceptors that respectively form the toner images of different colors, an intermediate transfer body for carrying out successive primary image transfers of each of the toner images of the plurality of photoreceptors, a plurality of primary transferring units that carry out the primary image transfer onto the intermediate transfer body, a secondary transferring unit that transfers a color toner image formed by superimposing on the intermediate transfer body onto a transfer material, a pre-charging unit that is placed on the downstream side of the primary transferring units in the direction of movement of the intermediate transfer body and upstream of the secondary transferring unit and that applies electric charge to the color toner image on the surface of the intermediate transfer body before the second image transfer with the polarity of the applied electrical charge being the same as that of the potential of the toner, and a potential adjustment unit that is placed downstream of the pre-charging unit in the direction of movement of the intermediate transfer body and upstream of the secondary transferring unit, and that applied an electric charge that has a polarity opposite to that of the potential of the toner, to the color toner image on the intermediate transfer body.",
        "In such a color image forming apparatus, it is preferable that the pre-charging unit and the potential adjustment unit are spaced away from and opposing the intermediate transfer body.",
        "In a such a color image forming apparatus, it is preferable that the potential of the formed color toner image is in the range of 0.5 V-2 V if the potential is V of the part at which the amount of toner adhesion is a maximum in a black color toner image that is formed using only a black color toner without operating the pre-charging unit and the potential adjustment unit.",
        "According to the color image forming apparatus of the prevent invention, since an electric charge with the same polarity as the potential of the toner constituting the color toner image is applied by the pre-charging unit so that the potential of the entire color toner image formed on the intermediate transfer body is uniform, that is, irrespective of whether the quantity of toner is small or large and irrespective of whether the toner is present or not, and further since the potential is reduced uniformly by the potential adjustment unit, it is possible to make the distribution of the electric charge have a high uniformity in the color toner image within the appropriate range for the secondary image transfer operation, and hence it is possible to obtain image transfer characteristics having a high uniformity in the color toner image during the secondary image transfer process. As a result, it is possible to obtain satisfactory color images without generating image defects.",

        "The photoreceptor 10Y has a photosensitive layer, for example, a resin made to include an organic photoelectric material on the outer periphery of a metallic drum-shaped base.",
        "The pre-charging unit 11Y is composed of a scorotron charger having, for example, a control grid and a charging electrode, and the exposure unit 12Y can, for example, be a laser irradiation unit.",
        "The developing unit 13Y, for example, is provided with a developing sleeve with built-in magnet that rotates while carrying the developing agent and a bias power supply 13B that applies DC bias or DC bias superimposed with AC bias between the photoreceptor 10Y and the developing sleeve.",
        "The primary transferring unit 14Y is constituted by the primary transfer roller 141Y that is placed so as to form the primary image transfer area in the condition in which it is pressed against the surface of the photoreceptor 10Y via the intermediate transfer body 17, and an image transfer power supply 14D including, for example, a constant current power supply that is connected to this primary transfer roller 141Y, and the yellow toner image on the photoreceptor 10Y is transferred onto the intermediate transfer body 17 by supplying current from the primary transfer power supply 14D to the primary transfer roller 141Y, that is, the image transfer is of the so called direct contact transfer method.",
        "The cleaning blade of the photoreceptor cleaning unit 20Y is made, for example, of an elastic body such as urethane rubber, which is not only supported at its end part by a supporting member but also is provided so that its tip part presses against the surface of the photoreceptor 10Y, and the direction extending from the tip side of the cleaning blade is the counter-direction that is opposite to the direction of movement due to rotation of the photoreceptor 10Y at the point of contact.",
        "Even in each of the other toner image forming units 30M, 30C, and 30K, the configurations are similar to that of the toner image forming unit 30Y of the yellow toner image excepting that the developing agent used is, instead of the yellow toner, the magenta toner, the cyan toner, or the black toner, respectively.",

        "Further, at a position on the downstream side of the secondary transferring unit 14S in the direction of movement of the intermediate transfer body 17 is provided the intermediate transfer body cleaning unit 20S that is provided with a cleaning blade that removes the non-transferred toner on the intermediate transfer body 17.",
        "In this manner, in the color image forming apparatus according to the present invention, on the downstream side of the primary transferring unit 14K at the most downstream position in the direction of movement of the intermediate transfer body 17, and also on the upstream side of the secondary transferring unit 14S are provided the pre-charging unit 24 constituted by, for example, a scorotron charger having a control grid, and the potential adjustment unit 26, along the direction of movement of the intermediate transfer body 17 in that sequence.",
        "The pre-charging unit 24 has the function of applying electric charge to the color toner image with the polarity of the charge being the same as that of the voltage of the toner constituting the color toner image, and is constituted by a discharging electrode 241 made of a discharging wire, a control grid 242 for controlling the magnitude of the potential of the color toner image by restricting the quantity of electric charge applied to the color toner image by the discharging electrode 241, and a supporting member 243 that is made of a conducting material and that supports the discharging electrode 241 and the control grid 242.",
        "The control grid 242 is provided opposite the surface of the intermediate transfer body 17 so as to have a gap of, for example, 1 mm away from it, and on the back surface of the intermediate transfer body 17 is provided the supporting roller 244 opposing the control grid 242 with the intermediate transfer body 17 positioned in between them.",
        "This supporting roller 244 is maintained in the grounded state while the supporting member 243 is maintained at the same potential as the control grid 242.",
        "Further, bias voltages are applied to the discharging electrode 241 and to the control grid 242 respectively from the pre-charging power supply 241A and pre-charging grid power supply 242A so as to apply to the color toner image an electric charge with a same polarity as the voltage of the toner constituting the color toner image.",
        "The magnitudes of the bias voltages applied to the discharging electrode 241 and to the control grid 242 are such that, for example, if the toner constituting the toner image has negative electric polarity, the magnitude of the bias voltage applied to the discharging electrode 241 is \u22123 kV to \u22125 kV and the magnitude of the bias voltage applied to the control grid 242 is \u2212200 V to \u2212400 V.",
        "The potential adjustment unit 26 has the function of applying electric charge to the color toner image on the intermediate transfer body 17 with the polarity of the charge being opposite to that of the voltage of the toner constituting the color toner image, that is, a polarity opposite to the charge applied to it by the pre-charging unit 24, and is constituted by a discharging electrode 261 made of a discharging wire, a control grid 262 for controlling the magnitude of the potential of the color toner image by restricting the quantity of electric charge applied to the color toner image by the discharging electrode 261, and a supporting member 263 that is made of a conducting material and that supports the discharging electrode 261 and the control grid 262.",
        "The control grid 262 is provided opposite the surface of the intermediate transfer body 17 so as to have a gap of, for example, 1 mm away from it, and is opposite the intermediate roller 17c via the intermediate transfer body 17.",
        "This intermediate roller 17c is maintained in the grounded state while the supporting member 263 is maintained at the same potential as the control grid 262.",
        "Further, bias voltages are applied to the discharging electrode 261 and to the control grid 262 respectively from the pre-charging power supply 261A and pre-charging grid power supply 262A so as to apply to the color toner image an electric charge with a polarity opposite to that of the voltage of the toner constituting the color toner image.",
        "The magnitudes of the bias voltages applied to the discharging electrode 261 and to the control grid 262 are such that, for example, if the toner constituting the toner image has negative electric-polarity, the magnitude of the bias voltage applied to the discharging electrode 261 is +3 kV to +5 kV and the magnitude of the bias voltage applied to the control grid 262 is \u221250 V to \u2212300 V.",
        "These units, that is, the pre-charging unit 24 and the potential adjustment unit 26 make the potential of the formed toner image come to the range of 0.5 V-2 V, or more preferably to the range of 0.7 V-0.1.4 V if the potential is V of the part at which the amount of toner adhesion is a maximum in a black color toner image that is formed using only a black color toner without operating this pre-charging unit 24 and this potential adjustment unit 26.",
        "<Toner>",
        "The toners used in the above color image forming apparatus should preferably be ones having a weight average particle diameter in the range of 4-7 \u03bcm. By using toners having a weight average particle diameter in the range of 4-7 \u03bcm, it is possible to reduce the presence of toners having excessive adhesion or toners having weak adhesion with the transfer material P in the fixing process using the fixing unit 18, and hence not only it is possible to obtain stable development characteristics over long periods but also to obtain high transfer efficiency increasing the half-tone image quality, whereby visible images are formed having improved image quality of thin lines or dots etc.",
        "Here, the volume average particle diameter is the average particle diameter measured by a Coulter Counter TA-II unit (manufactured by Beckman-Coulter).",
        "Such toners are obtained by polymerizing polymerizable monomers in a water-based medium, and the fine polymer particles are prepared, for example, by suspension polymerization or by emulsion polymerization of monomers in a liquid to which has been added an emulsifier liquid as a necessary additive, and thereafter, by the coagulating method of adding an organic solvent or a coagulant. At the time of coagulation, it is also possible to use the methods of carrying out coagulation after mixing dispersion liquids such as mold releasing agents or coloring agents necessary for the composition of the toner, or of carrying out emulsion polymerization after dispersing the toner constituent materials such as mold releasing agents or coloring agents. Here, the word \u201ccoagulation\u201d implies the fusion of several particles of the resin and the coloring agent. In addition, the water-based medium in the present invention implies one that has at least 50% by mass of water.",
        "Taking an example of the method of manufacturing such a toner, various constituent materials such as coloring agents and, if necessary, mold releasing agents, charge control agents, and also polymerization initiating agents, etc., are added to the polymerizing monomer and the different constituent materials are dissolved or dispersed in the polymerizing monomer using a homogenizer, sand mill, sand grinder, or ultrasonic dispersing equipment, etc. This polymerizing monomer in which the different constituent materials are dissolved or dispersed is dispersed in a water-based medium containing a dispersion stabilizing agent using a homo-mixer or a homogenizer so as to have oil droplets with the desired size as a toner. Thereafter, it is transferred to a reaction equipment in which the stirring mechanism is stirring blades described later, and the polymerization process is made to proceed by heating. After the polymerization reaction is completed, the dispersion stabilizing agent is removed, and the toner is produced by filtering, cleaning, and further drying.",
        "It is preferable that the degree of spherical nature of the toner is in the range of 0.94-0.98. The degree of spherical nature is obtained, for example, by sampling 500 times enlarged toner particle images of 500 randomly chosen resin particles using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and carrying out toner particle image analysis using an image analyzing equipment (the Scanning Image Analyzer manufactured by Nihon Denshi) and calculating using Equation 1 below.\n\nDegree of spherical nature=(circumference of a circle with the same area as the particle projection)/(circumference of the particle projection).\u2003\u2003Equation 1",
        "When the degree of spherical nature is less than 0.94, the unevenness of the particles becomes large, the particles are likely to be crushed due to being subjected to large stresses in the machine, and since the tone particles are not charged uniformly in the developing units 13Y, 13M, 13C, and 13K, it is not possible to form satisfactory visible images. On the other hand, when the degree of spherical nature is higher than 0.98, since the toner particles are very close to being perfect spheres, the cleaning performance becomes degraded.",
        "In the color image forming apparatus according to the present invention, by using developing agents including toners that have been manufactured according to the method described above and that have shapes with spherical shapes and small diameters satisfying the specific conditions, it is possible to increase the half-tone image quality and to form visible images having improved image quality of thin lines or dots, etc.",
        "The toners described above can be used as single component developing agents or as two-component developing agents.",
        "When using the toners as single component developing agents, it is possible to consider the use of non-magnetic single component developing agents or magnetic developing agents in which the toner is made to include magnetic particles of sizes in the range of 0.1-0.5 \u03bcm, and either type of these can be used in the present invention.",
        "Further, when using as a two-component developing agent by mixing with a carrier, it is possible to use as the magnetic particles of the carrier materials considered conventionally as appropriately suitable such as metallic iron, ferrite, magnetite, etc., or alloys of such metals and other metals such as aluminum, lead, etc., and ferrite particles are particularly preferable. The volume average particle diameters of the above magnetic particles are preferably in the range of 15 \u03bcm-100 \u03bcm, and still more preferably in the range of 25 \u03bcm-80 \u03bcm.",
        "The volume average particle diameters of the carrier can be measured typically using a laser diffraction type particle size distribution measuring apparatus \u201cHELOS\u201d (manufactured by Sympatec Corporation) provided with a wet type dispersion unit.",
        "In this color image forming apparatus, the image forming operation is carried out in the following manner. That is, in each of the toner image forming units 30Y, 30M, 30C, and 30K, the photoreceptors 10Y, 10M, 10C, and 10K are rotated by driving, these photoreceptors 10Y, 10M, 10C, and 10K are charged to a specific polarity, for example, to negative polarity, by the charging units 11Y, 11M, 11C, and 11K, and next, in the image forming areas on the surfaces of the photoreceptors where the toner images are to be formed, the potentials are reduced at the illuminated locations (the exposed regions) due to the exposures by the exposing units 12Y, 12M, 12C, and 12K thereby forming the electrostatic latent images on the photoreceptors 10Y, 10M, 10C, and 10K corresponding to the image of the original document, the toners charged to the same polarity as the surface potentials of the photoreceptors 10Y, 10M, 10C, and 10K, for example, with a negative polarity, get adhered to electrostatic latent images of the photoreceptors 10Y, 10M, 10C, and 10K thereby carrying out negative development and thus forming the toner images of the different colors.",
        "Further, the toner images of different colors in the primary transfer areas are successively subjected to primary image transfer by the respective primary transferring units 14Y, 14M, 14C, and 14K in a superimposing manner thereby forming the color toner image on the intermediate transfer body 17.",
        "Next, electric charge is applied with the same polarity as that of the toner potential so that the entire color toner image is taken to a uniformly high potential by the pre-charging unit 24, and thereafter, the potential is reduced uniformly to an appropriate voltage in the secondary image transfer process by the voltage adjustment unit 26.",
        "Thereafter, a secondary image transfer potential controlled to an appropriate voltage by the secondary image transfer power supply is applied to the secondary transfer roller 141S of the secondary transferring unit 14S, and the color toner image having a uniform potential state as described above is subjected to secondary image transfer whereby the color toner image on the intermediate transfer body 17 is transferred to the transfer material P that has been transported, and then the fixing process is carried out by the fixing unit 18 thereby forming the color image.",

As a result, there is no occurrence of image defects such as image deterioration, toner splashes, or uneven density and it is possible to obtain satisfactory color images.",
