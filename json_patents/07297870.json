As will be discussed further, the frame arm 32 is manufactured from a single blank into various configurations to allow the fixture frame 30 to receive various aperture ring sizes.",
        "The elbows 40, 42 are formed at ends of the first arm portion 34 to partially define a pre-selected spacing between the second arm portion 36 and the third arm portion 38 as well as between the mounting brackets 60. As shown in FIG. 1, the spacing between the second and third arm portions 36, 38 and the opposed mounting brackets 60 is provided to receive the aperture ring 16 wherein a reflector and lamp may be located. The elbows 40, 42 may be disposed at various positions and in various orientations in order to change the configuration of the blank so that a single blank may be utilized to form a fixture frame which may be used in combination with various light fixture sizes. Thus, although the first, second and third arm portions are described as part of the frame arm 32, the elbows are the structural feature which distinguish these portions from one another.",
        "One advantage of the instant invention is that a single frame 30 may be utilized to receive multiple aperture ring sizes. Accordingly, various size reflectors may be utilized with the frame 30. A further advantage of the present invention is that the frame 30 may be formed from a single blank and may be manufactured to receive various reflector sizes, as described herein.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 3-6, the fixture frame 30 is shown in various views from the starting point of a blank piece of metal through various tooling processes to form the fixture frame 30 shown in FIG. 2. The fixture frame 30 is depicted in FIG. 3 as a blank prior to any folding processes by tooling equipment during manufacturing. The blank layout of the fixture frame 30 is depicted with solid lines representing the edges of the cut blank while fold lines generally shown as broken lines along the blank and is formed in a progressive die. As previously described, the fixture frame 30 has a junction box 50 comprising a bottom wall 58, opposed side walls 54,56 and two surfaces which are folded to generally form the top wall 52. Integrally connected to the junction box is the frame arm 32, which is defined by the first arm portion 34, the second arm portion 36 and the third arm portion 38, the latter portions 36, 38 disposed at the opposed ends of the first arm portion. The blank also reveals the elbows 40, 42 generally distinguishing the first arm portion 34 from the second and third arm portions 36, 38 as will be described further herein.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 4, the fixture frame 30 is shown in a perspective view. The junction box 50 is formed in the progressive die and is shown partially formed by folding the side walls 54,56 at opposed edges of the bottom wall 58. As the side walls 54,56 are folded upwardly the two sections defining the top wall 52 are also folded such that the junction box is partially formed. Preferably, the junction box 50 is fully formed in the progressive die but is depicted in the FIGS. 3-6 to show the progression of bends made to form the junction box 50. The frame arm 32 is still depicted in its flattened position so that the elbows are not distinguishing the first arm portion 34 from the second and third arm portions 36, 38.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 5, the junction box 50 is again shown in its partially completed position. The frame arm 32 is folded at a substantially perpendicular angle to the junction box 50, which may be performed in the progressive die or a secondary tooling. Further, the frame arm 32 is shown with elbows 40 and 42 distinguishing the first arm portion 34 from the second and third arm portions 36, 38. The frame arm 32 is bent in a secondary tooling to begin forming the elbows 40,42. The elbows 40, 42 are not fully formed since the first and second arm portions 36, 38 are not fully disposed in a parallel configuration, as depicted in FIG. 2. Depending on the size/embodiment of the fixture frame 30 being formed, as discussed further herein, different secondary toolings may be utilized.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 6, the junction box 50 is fully folded so that the two upper surfaces defining the top wall are properly oriented and aligned to receive a junction box door retaining arm or spring 53 and fastener, such as a rivet or screw. Further, the frame arm 32 is fully folded in a secondary tooling to its substantially U-shaped configuration so that the elbows 40, 42 are fully formed. As a result, the second and third arm portions 36, 38 are parallel to one another and substantially perpendicular to the first arm portion 34. Further, in this position, the mounting brackets 60, are also parallel to properly receive an aperture ring of a pre-selected specific size.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 7, a first alternative embodiment of a fixture frame 130 is depicted comprising elbows 140, 142 which are formed during manufacture of the product in order to receive the aperture ring of a smaller size than that of FIG. 1. The elbows 140, 142 are bent in a manner which is different from the ninety degree (90\u00b0) bend shown in FIG. 2. According to the second embodiment, elbows 140, 142 each comprise a first bend 143 and a second bend 145. The first bend 143 extends from the first arm portion 134 toward the junction box 50. The second bend 145 is greater than 90 degrees and turns toward a distal end of the second and third arm portions, away from the junction box 50. Accordingly, the first bend defines a first obtuse angle and the second bend defines an acute angle to provide a pre-selected distance between the second and third arm portions 136, 138. With this first alternative embodiment, the elbows 140,142 design effectively shortens the frame arm length 32 so that the preselected distance between the second frame arm portion and the third frame arm portion is decreased, as compared to the first embodiment of FIG. 2. With this design, the frame arm 132 is sized to receive a ring aperture of a smaller diameter than the ring aperture 16 of Figure with fixture frame 30. Further, the frame 130 may be formed of the same material and the same blank as used to form the fixture frame 30. By merely changing the elbow bending step during manufacturing, the blank may be shaped to form a ring aperture of a larger or smaller size.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 8, a second alternative fixture frame 230 is depicted. The fixture frame 230 comprises a junction box as well as a frame arm 232 defined by a first arm portion 234 having first and second ends integrally connected to the junction box 50. The frame arm 234 further comprises second and third arm portions 236,238 connected by elbows 240,242 to first and second ends of the first arm portion 234. The frame arm 232 defines a substantially U-shaped structure as shown in the fixture frame 30 of FIG. 2 such that the second and third arm portions 236,238 are parallel. However, the second and third arm portions 236,238 are spaced apart a preselected distance further than the fixture frame 30 (FIG. 2) or fixture frame 130 (FIG. 7) so as to receive an aperture ring having a larger diameter than the fixture frame 30 or the fixture frame 130. Accordingly, the first arm portion 234 is longer than that of the first arm portion 34 (FIG. 2) or the first arm portion 134 (FIG. 7). Elbows 240, 242 extend between the first arm portion and the second and third arm portions, respectively. By lengthening the first arm portion 234 and locating ninety-degree (90\u00b0) elbows 240,242 at first and second ends of the first arm portion 234 the preselected distance between the first arm portion 236 and the third arm portion 238 and mounting brackets 60 is widened to receive an aperture ring of a larger diameter than the fixture frame 30 and first alternative fixture frame 130. Otherwise stated, the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 8 moves the elbows 240,242 laterally along the first arm portion 234 and away from the junction box 50 in order to widen the distance between the second arm portion 236 and third arm portion 238. However, this embodiment is formed from the same blank as the fixture frames 30 and 130 but can accept different sized aperture rings by merely changing the elbow 240,242 configuration.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 9, a third alternative embodiment is depicted. A fixture frame 330 comprises a junction box 50 and a substantially U-shaped arm 332. The arm 332 comprises a first portion 334 and opposed second and third arm portions 336, 338 respectively. The second and third arm portions 336, 338 are disposed at first and second ends of the first arm portion 334 by elbows 340, 342, respectively. The first elbow 340 and second elbow 342 are defined by obtuse angles as measured between the inside surface of the second arm portion 336 or third arm portion 338 and the inner surface of the first arm portion 334. By forming the frame arm 332 in such a manner, the mounting brackets 60 are spaced apart at a pre-selected distance to receive an aperture ring of a size larger than the previously described embodiments. Since the second and third arm portions 336,338 are not parallel as in the previously described embodiments, clip elbows 349 are formed at distal ends of the second and third arm portions 336,338 so that the clip mechanisms 14 are parallel for proper connection of the aperture ring 16. One of ordinary skill in the art should recognize that the fixture frame 330 is also formed from the blank (FIG. 3) which is utilized to form the previously described embodiments.",
