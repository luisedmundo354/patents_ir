        "The present invention relates to a computerized system for determining a customized feed for animals, such as cattle, swine, poultry, fish, crustaceans and the like. In particular, the system determines a feed mix based upon data relating to information such as animal characteristics, available ingredients, speed of product production, and cost of production.",
        "In food production, and specifically producing animal products such as milk, beef, pork, eggs, chicken, fish etc., there is need to improve production efficiency. Production efficiency, i.e. producing the maximum quantity of animal products while minimizing the time and cost of production for those products, is important in maintaining a competitive advantage.",
        "A producer (i.e. a farmer, rancher, pork producer, and the like) generally wants to maximize the amount of animal product produced (e.g. gallons of milk, pounds of beef or pork produced) while keeping the costs associated with feed at a low level in order to achieve maximum animal productivity. The maximized amount of animal product should be produced at a minimized cost to the producer. Costs to the producer include the cost of feed needed to produce the animal products, as well as the costs of related equipment and facilities needed in the production of animal products. In order to minimize the effect of fixed costs associated with equipment and facilities, the maximum amount of animal product should preferably be produced in a minimum time period.",
        "Producers are constantly trying to increase these production efficiencies. One way of increasing production efficiencies is by altering the feed which animals are fed. For example, a feed with certain amounts of nutrients can cause an animal to grow or produce animal products quickly and/or perform better, whereas a different feed with different amounts of nutrients may cause an animal to grow or produce animal products on a more cost effective basis.",
        "Current systems for creating animal feed are not fully capable of helping producers evaluate and improve production efficiencies. Current systems commonly generate an overall nutrient profile which is related to a set of animal characteristics. Such systems then look at the overall nutrient profile and compare what nutrients may be had from the on-farm ingredients. From this comparison, a \u201cnutritional gap\u201d can be calculated, i.e., the nutritional requirements that the producer needs to fulfill his production goals after accounting for the use of his on-site feed. This nutritional gap is then compared to the nutritional components which may be available from ingredients located at a supplier's mill. Through a comparison of the nutritional gap and the nutritional components available from the mill, current systems allow a supplier to provide a cost effective custom feed which is optimized to permit an animal to produce desired animal products on a cost minimized basis.",
        "Currently systems exist that are capable of taking the amounts of on-farm ingredients to be used in the overall diet of the animal into account. This is typically done by accounting for the on-farm component of the animal's diet as a fixed input parameter in the determination. It would be advantageous to be able to modify the amounts of on-farm ingredients to be used in forming the custom feed as part of the optimization process. Moreover, current systems are generally limited to generating the custom feed based on a single evaluation criteria, typically based on the cost of the feed (e.g., on a cost of feed per unit of animal weight gain basis). It would be advantageous to have a system which is capable of utilizing more than one evaluation criteria in generating the custom feed.",
        "One embodiment of the present invention provides a system for determining customized feed for animals, such as farm livestock, poultry, fish and crustaceans. The system stores animal data representative of the characteristics of the animal, feed data representative of the feed ingredients located at one or more locations, and evaluation data representative of at least one evaluation criteria. The evaluation criteria are generally related to factors representative of animal productivity. An optimization weighting is used to indicate the weight assigned to the evaluation criteria. Examples of evaluation criteria include (i) animal production rate (e.g., the rate of animal weight gain or the rate of production of a food product such as milk or eggs); (ii) cost of feed per unit animal weight gain; and (iii) feed weight per unit animal weight gain. The system includes a data processing circuit, which may be one or more programmed microprocessors, in communication with a data storage device or devices which store the data. The data processing circuit is configured to generate profile data representative of a nutrient profile for the animals based upon the animal data. In effect, the nutrient profile is a description of the overall diet to be fed to the animals defined in terms of a set of nutritional parameters (\u201cnutrients\u201d). Using the profile data, the data processing circuit generates ration data representative of a combination of ingredients from one or more locations. The ration data is generated by the data processing circuit based upon the profile data, the feed data, the evaluation data, and the optimization weighting data.",
        "Another embodiment of the system includes system for determining customized feed for at least one animal. The system includes first memory means for storing animal data representative of the characteristics of the animal, second memory means for storing feed data representative of the feed ingredients located at at least one location, third memory for storing evaluation data representative of at least two evaluation criteria, and processing means for generating profile data representative of a nutrient profile for the animal based upon the animal data, processing means further generating ration data representative of a combination of ingredients from the location, the ration data being generated by the processing means based upon the profile data, the feed data and the evaluation data. The system further includes fourth memory means for storing optimization weighting data representative of the effect a respective evaluation criteria has on the generation of the ration data, the processing means further generating the ration data based upon the optimization weighting data.",
        "A further embodiment of the present invention provides a method for determining customized feed for at least one animal. The method includes storing animal data representative of the characteristics of the animal, storing feed data representative of the feed ingredients located at at least one location, storing evaluation data representative of at least two evaluation criteria, storing optimization weighting data representative of the effect a respective evaluation criteria, generating profile data representative of a nutrient profile for the animal based upon the animal data; and generating ration data representative of a combination of ingredients from the location, the ration data being generated based upon the profile data, the feed data, the evaluation data, and the optimization weighting data.",
        "As modifications to the embodiments described herein, systems and/or methods may rely on more than one optimizing criteria and/or feed data representative of ingredients located at more than one location. For example, ingredients which could be used to create the ration may be located at the farm associated with the animals as well as at the mill of an ingredient supplier. Depending upon the requirements of the system, processing can be consolidated in one processor or divided between processors in communication via a network such as a LAN or the Internet. Furthermore, the processors may be located in devices such as workstations, portable PC's and/or hand held computers.",

        "An exemplary system, and process which can be used in producing a customized feed for animals, such as livestock, poultry, fish or crustaceans is described herein. How the system and process can increase production efficiencies by customizing feed is also disclosed. It is particularly desirable if the system and methods are capable of determining an optimized feed using one or more evaluation criteria. Examples of suitable evaluation criteria include a feed cost per unit animal weight gain basis, an animal production rate basis (e.g., based upon a rate of animal weight gain or a rate of production of an animal product, such as milk or eggs), and a feed amount per unit of animal weight gain basis.",

In other embodiments, hardwired circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with, software instructions to implement the present method. Thus, the embodiments described herein are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and/or software, nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the computer system.",
        "Creating a customized feed typically involves processing and manipulating at least four basic data sets (see, e.g., FIG. 1): first feed data representative of the collection of ingredients located at a first location 1, second feed data representative of the collection ingredients located at a second location 2, animal data representative of characteristics of the animal 3 (e.g., parameters related to its genotype, production level, environment and/or feeding regime), and evaluation criteria 4. As will be explained below, very often first and second feed data representative of sets of ingredients located at an on-farm site (first ingredients 1 located at a first location) and ingredients located at a supplier's mill site (second ingredients 2 located at a second location) are used to generate the recommended mix of ingredients to be fed to the animal. In many instances, the ration data define an overall diet for the animal which includes custom rations from more than one location (e.g., a custom ration from a first location 7 and a custom ration from a second location 8 as depicted in FIG. 1). These can be combined to create a customized feed (\u201cration\u201d) which fulfills the animal data requirements while meeting the evaluation criteria 4.",
        "The evaluation criteria may be chosen from such suitable criteria related to animal productivity as (i) animal production rate, (ii) cost of feed per unit animal weight gain, and (iii) feed weight per unit animal weight gain.",
        "In some modified embodiments, the present system may include additional memory portions for storing nutrient level constraints 5 and/or ingredient level constraints 6. This may be useful where, for example, it has been established that higher levels of certain nutritional components could pose a risk to the health of an animal being fed the custom feed. For example, if the custom feed includes some trace minerals, such as selenium, present in too great an amount, the custom feed may have adverse health consequences to the animal. Various embodiments of the present invention allow constraints to be placed on the maximum and/or minimum amounts of one or more nutrients in the profile data generated. In some embodiments, this may be used together with the animal data as a basis to calculate the profile data. These constraints may be stored in a memory location as part of the system or the system may permit an individual operator to input one or more constraints on the amount of particular nutrient(s) in the profile data generated by the system. Similarly, it may be desirable to limit the amounts of one or more ingredients in either a custom product mix or in the overall diet to be fed to the animal. For example, for ease of formulation of a custom feed in pellet form it may be desirable to limit the amount of certain ingredients and/or require the inclusion of minimum amounts of specified ingredients.",
        "The first data set that is generally input into the system and subsequently stored in a memory portion includes data representative of characteristics of the animal. Examples of types of data representative of animal characteristics (\u201canimal data\u201d) include beginning weight of the animal; a desired weight of the animal; an environment of the animal; a feed form; an actual or desired production level of the animal; and a relationship of animal muscle to fat of the animal. For example, the nutrient profile generated for a particular animal can vary based upon a number of different characteristics of the animal relating to one or more of its genotype, environment, current condition (e.g., defined in terms of health and/or weight), desired production level, feed form (e.g., meal or pellet), current production level, desired final condition (e.g., defined in terms of final weight and/or relationship of animal muscle to fat of the animal) and the like.

        "Evaluation criteria are typically related to factors representative of animal productivity and reflect an aspect of production a producer would like to optimize. The present system allows a producer to select evaluation criteria (e.g. cost/gain, cost/output, animal production rate, and/or feed/gain) which fits the producer's production goals. For example, a dairy producer may focus on the cost of feed required to produce a unit of output (cost/output), whereas a pork producer may focus on cost/gain or rate of gain.",
        "Examples of suitable animal production criteria which may be used as evaluation criteria in the generation of ration data include (i) animal production rate, (ii) the cost of feed per unit animal weight gain, and (iii) the feed weight per unit animal weight gain. The animal production rate may simply be a measure representative of the rate of weight gain of the animal in question (rate of gain). For example, a pork producer may wish to optimize rate of gain by selecting a feed which maximizes the rate at which a pig gains weight. This could be selected if a pig farmer was interested in turning over production as quickly as possible in a fixed asset which has limited space. The evaluation data may include data representative of the cost of feed required to produce a unit of weight gain of the animal (\u201ccost/gain\u201d basis). For example, a pork producer may wish to optimize cost/gain by selecting a feed which minimizes the feed cost required to make a pig gain a unit of weight. The evaluation data can include data representative of the amount of feed required to produce a unit of gain (feed/gain). For example, a producer may wish to optimize the feed/gain by selecting a feed which minimizes the amount of feed required to produce a unit of gain. A producer might select this criterion if they were faced with feed storage space constraints.",
        "Examples of other suitable animal production rates which may be used as an evaluation criteria include rates of production of food products, such as milk or eggs, from the animal. Other suitable evaluation criteria include the cost of feed required to produce a unit of output of a particular animal product (\u201ccost/output\u201d). For example, a milk producer may wish to optimize the cost/output by selecting a feed which minimizes the cost of feed required to produce a unit of milk. In addition to utilizing evaluation data representative of only a single evaluation criteria, the present system may be capable of using evaluation data representative of a combination of two or more evaluation criteria in generating the ration data. For example, when considering an appropriate feed, a producer may wish to generate a custom feed based on the rate of production as well as cost of the feed (typically on a cost/gain basis).",
        "Furthermore, the producer may choose to weight the relative contributions of two or more evaluation criteria. The system may include a data processing circuit which generates ration data based in part upon a weighted average of more than one evaluation criteria. In one specific embodiment, the system generates ration data based in part upon a 70:30 weighted average of two evaluation criteria (primary and secondary), such as a combination of cost of feed per unit animal weight gain and animal production rate. The system may also allow a user to alter the relative weighting accorded to the various evaluation criteria selected.",
        "For instance, in the example referred to above, the producer may want to generate ration data using a combination of evaluation criteria that is weighted 70% on a cost/gain basis and 30% on a rate of animal weight gain basis. One method for providing such a weighted optimization analysis is to generate one solution for ration data using cost/gain as the sole evaluation criteria and generating a second for ration data using rate of animal weight gain as the sole evaluation criteria. Ration data which is representative of the weighted combined solution can be achieved by summing 70% of the amounts of ingredients from the cost/gain ration data set and 30% of the amounts of ingredients from the rate of gain ration data set. For example, in the instance where cost/gain ration data (generated solely on a cost/gain basis) includes 10% dehulled corn meal, and rate of gain ration data (generated solely on a rate of gain basis) includes 15% dehulled corn meal, if a producer chose cost/gain as the primary evaluation criteria the ingredient mix in the diet will include roughly 70% of the 10% dehulled corn meal requirement, and 30% of the 15% dehulled corn meal requirement summed to produce the amount of dehulled corn meal in the overall diet (i.e., circa 11.5% dehulled corn meal). This weighted summation is then repeated for all the amounts of ingredients present in the two custom diets generated by the two approaches. As one skilled in the art will recognize, there are other methods of generating ration data based on a weighted combination of evaluation criteria. The present system can also be configured to generate ration data based on other weightings of combinations of two or more evaluation criteria (e.g., two evaluation criteria weighted on either a 60:40 or 80:20 basis). In some embodiments of the present system, the weighting factors assigned to various evaluation criteria can themselves be input parameter(s) chosen by a producer to reflect the needs of his/her particular situation.",
        "FIG. 2 depicts the general flow of data in one embodiment of the present system. The system shown in FIG. 2 includes a data processing circuit 30 configured to generate a nutrient profile 32 based on the animal data 31 and optional adjustments which may be provided by a nutritionist. Other data processing circuits generate lists of nutrient amounts associated with individual ingredients available at an on-farm site 33 and manufacturing site 34. A data processing circuit 36, which includes a linear program generates a custom product based on evaluation criteria 35. The linear program typically also generates the custom product solution based on pricing data associated with both the on-farm and manufacturing site ingredients. In one embodiment, retail and wholesale pricing information may be normalized to allow the linear program to facilitate consideration of potential ingredients with different types of associated prices as the basis for a solution to a single multivariable problem. The linear program is a mathematical model capable of solving problems involving a large number of variables limited by constraints using linear math functions. A variety of different linear programs capable of solving problems of this type are known to those of skill in the art. One example of a program of this type is commercially available from Format International as part of computer software system for solving complicated multivariable problems.",

Ration data generated by the present system generally includes data representative of the types and amounts of ingredients to be used to provide an overall custom diet for an animal. The ration data provided by the system generally also specifies a solution that is described in terms of a combination of types and amounts of ingredients from a first location (e.g., an on-farm location) and types and amounts of ingredients from at least one additional site (e.g., one or more supplier locations). Where the overall set of potential ingredients includes ingredients located at more than one location, the custom feed specified by the ration data may be made of ingredients located at either a single location or from more than one location. For example, the ration data may define a custom feed made up from ingredients located solely at supplier location or made up from ingredients located at both an on-farm location and a supplier location.",

The present system may also provide custom feed data which specifies the types and amounts of ingredients to be used from individual locations. For example, the custom feed data may include a listing of the types and amounts of ingredients available at a first location (e.g., on-farm ingredients) to be used to form a first feed mix and a listing of the types and amounts of ingredients available at a second location (e.g., ingredients available at a supplier location) to be used to form a second feed mix.

        "In other variations of the embodiments described herein, the systems and/or methods may also include a memory portion in communication with the digital processor which stores variation data representative of a range for one or more nutrient components of the nutrient profile. The digital processor is capable of generating a set of ration data based upon the variation data. The memory portion may store variation data which correspond to preselected incremental variations for the values assigned to one or more individual nutrients in the nutritional profile. For example, memory portion may store variation data which correspond to preselected incremental positive and negative variations of the values assigned to two individual nutrients, such as true digestible lysine and net energy. The digital processor would generate ration data corresponding to each of the eight possible additional combinations of values for the two specified nutrients. Together with the ration data associated with the original nutritional profile, the resulting set of nine ration data corresponding to the various combinations of values for each specified nutrient (original value, original value plus an increment; original value minus an increment) would make up a three by three matrix of ration data. One example of this approach is illustrated in Table 11 below. A general approach to generating a set of ration data based upon variation data is depicted schematically in FIG. 3. The determination of ration data for the center point in the matrix (\u201cRation Data 5\u201d) corresponds to the solution generated by the data processing circuit based on the nutrient profile. In the example shown in Table 11, the nutrient profile has values of 0.90% for true digestible lysine and 2150 kcal/kg for net energy. Each of the eight other ration data in the set depicted in Table 11 corresponds to a ration data generated for a modified nutrient profile in which the value for at least one nutrient has been varied by a specified increment. For example, Ration Data 1 represents ration data associated with a modified nutrient profile has values of 0.95% for true digestible lysine and 2100 kcal/kg for net energy. Ration Data 6 represents ration data associated with a modified nutrient profile in which only the value for true digestible lysine (0.85%) has been varied from the values in the nutrient profile. The generation of such a matrix can facilitate an evaluation of the effect of incremental variations in amounts of specified nutrient(s) on the assessment of optimum ration data for a given evaluation criteria.",
