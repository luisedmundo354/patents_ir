For example, the heat transfer coefficient can vary in a radial direction between a substantially central region of the thermal insulator 140 (below substrate 110) and a substantially edge region of the thermal insulator 140 (below substrate 110). The spatial variation of the heat transfer coefficient may comprise a non-uniform spatial variation of the thermal conductivity (W/m\u2212K) of the thermal insulator 140, or the spatial variation of the heat transfer coefficient may comprise a non-uniform spatial variation of the thickness of the thermal insulator 140, or both. As used herein, the term \u201cnon-uniform spatial variation\u201d of a parameter means a spatial variation of the parameter across an area of the substrate holder that is caused by design rather than inherent minor variations of the parameter across a substrate holder. Further, the term \u201csubstantially central region of the thermal insulator\u201d means a region of the thermal insulator that would overlap a center of the substrate if placed on the substrate holder, and the term \u201csubstantially edge region of the thermal insulator\u201d means a region of the thermal insulator that would overlap an edge of the substrate if placed on the substrate holder.",

Alternatively yet, a layer of material having a different thermal conductivity than that of the thermal insulator 240 may be disposed on a portion of either the upper surface of support base 220 or the lower surface of substrate support 230.

Heating element control unit 532 is configured to provide either dependent or independent control of each heating element, and exchange information with a controller 550.",
        "Additionally, as shown in FIG. 6, the substrate holder 500 can further comprise an electrostatic clamp (ESC) comprising one or more clamping electrodes 535 embedded within substrate support 530. The ESC further comprises a high-voltage (HV) DC voltage supply 534 coupled to the clamping electrodes 535 via an electrical connection. The design and implementation of such a clamp is well known to those skilled in the art of electrostatic clamping systems. Furthermore, the HV DC voltage supply 534 is coupled to controller 550 and is configured to exchange information with controller 550.",
        "Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 6, the substrate holder 500 can further comprise a back-side gas supply system 536 for supplying a heat transfer gas, such as an inert gas including helium, argon, xenon, krypton, a process gas, or other gas including oxygen, nitrogen, or hydrogen, to the center region and the edge region of the backside of substrate 510 through two gas supply lines, and at least two of a plurality of orifices and channels (not shown).

Furthermore, the backside gas supply system 536 is coupled to controller 550 and is configured to exchange information with controller 550.",
        "Further yet, as shown in FIG. 6, the substrate holder 500 further comprises a center temperature sensor 562 for measuring a temperature at a substantially center region below substrate 510 and an edge temperature sensor 564 for measuring a temperature at a substantially edge region below substrate 510. The center and edge temperature sensors 562, 564 are coupled to a temperature monitoring system 560.",
        "Referring now to FIG. 8, a flowchart describing a method 700 of controlling the temperature of a substrate on a substrate holder in a processing system is presented according to another embodiment. For example, the temperature control scheme can pertain to multiple process steps for a process in a processing system having a substrate holder such as one of those described in FIGS. 1 through 6. The method 700 begins in 710 with disposing a substrate on a substrate holder.",
        "The substrate holder comprises a plurality of temperature sensors reporting at least a temperature at an inner region and an outer region of the substrate and/or substrate holder. Additionally, the substrate holder comprises a substrate support having a first heating element and a second heating element heating the inner region and the outer region respectively, and a support base having a cooling element for cooling the inner region and the outer region. The first and second heating elements and the cooling element are controlled by a temperature control system to maintain the substrate holder at a selectable set-point temperature. Furthermore, the substrate holder comprises a thermal insulator disposed between the substrate support and the support base.",
        "In 720, the substrate is set to a first temperature profile. Using the temperature control system, a first base temperature for the base support (that is less than the first temperature profile (e.g. the substrate temperature), and a first inner set-point temperature and a first outer set-point temperature are selected. Thereafter, the temperature control system adjusts the cooling element and the first and second heating elements to achieve the selected temperatures described above.",
        "In 730, the substrate is set to a second temperature profile. Using the temperature control system, a second base temperature for the base support, and a second inner set-point temperature and a second outer set-point temperature are selected. Thereafter, the temperature control system changes the substrate temperature from the first temperature profile (i.e., first inner and outer set-point temperatures) to the second temperature profile (i.e., second inner and outer set-point temperatures) by optionally adjusting the cooling element to change the first base temperature to the second base temperature and adjusting the inner and outer heating elements until the second inner and outer set-point temperatures are achieved.",
        "In one example, the substrate temperature is increased (or decreased) from the first temperature profile to the second temperature profile, while the second base temperature remains the same as the first base temperature. The power delivered to the inner and outer heating elements is increased (or decreased) in order to heat (or cool) the substrate from the first temperature profile to the second temperature profile.",
        "In another example, the substrate temperature is increased (or decreased) from the first temperature profile to the second temperature profile, while the second base temperature is changed to a value different from the first base temperature. The power delivered to the inner and outer heating elements is increased (or decreased) in order to heat (or cool) the substrate from the first temperature profile to the second temperature profile, while the power delivered to the cooling element is increased (or decreased) in order to change the first base temperature to the second base temperature. Thus, according to one embodiment of the invention, the temperature of the support base is varied to assist the substrate support in controlling the temperature of the substrate. The present inventors have recognized that this varying of the support base temperature can provide more accurate and/or rapid temperature transitions of the substrate.",
        "The temperature control system utilizes a control algorithm in order to stably adjust temperature(s) in response to measured values provided by the temperature monitoring system. The control algorithm can, for example, include a PID (proportional, integral and derivative) controller. In a PID controller, the transfer function in the s-domain (i.e., Laplacian space) can be expressed as:\n\nGC(s)=Kp+KDs+KIs\u22121,\u2003\u2003(1)",
        "where KP, KD, and KI are constants, referred to herein as a set of PID parameters. The design challenge for the control algorithm is to select the set of PID parameters to achieve the desired performance of the temperature control system.",
        "Referring to FIG. 7A, several exemplary time traces of temperature are shown to illustrate how different sets of PID parameters lead to a different temperature response. In each case, the temperature is increased from a first value to a second value. A first time trace of temperature 601 illustrates a relatively aggressive control scheme having a relatively low value for KI, for example, wherein the time trace exhibits \u201covershoot\u201d and a series of oscillations following the overshoot. A second time trace of temperature 602 illustrates a relatively less aggressive control scheme having a relatively higher value for KI, for example, wherein the time trace exhibits a relatively slow, gradual increase to the second temperature. A third time trace of temperature 603 illustrates a desired moderately aggressive control scheme having a value for KI between that of time trace 601 and time trace 602, for example, wherein the time trace exhibits a relatively faster increase to the second temperature without overshoot. However, the present inventors have recognized that the use of only one PID parameter set is not sufficient to provide a desired condition for stability and rise rate.",
        "According to one embodiment, two or more PID parameter sets are utilized to achieve a rapid and stable adjustment of the temperature between an initial value and a final value. FIG. 7B illustrates an exemplary time trace of temperature 600 utilizing two sets of PID parameters. A first set of PID parameters is used for a first time duration 622, and a second set of PID parameters is used for a second time duration 624. The first time duration 622 can be determined by setting a temperature offset 620 from the final value of the temperature. For example, the temperature offset can range from approximately 50% to 99% of the temperature difference between the initial value and the final value. Additionally, for example, the temperature offset can range from approximately 70% to 95% of the temperature difference between the initial value and the final value, and desirably, the temperature offset can range from approximately 80% to 95%.",
        "For example, a relatively aggressive PID parameter set may be used for the first time duration 622, while a relatively less aggressive PID parameter set may be used for the second time duration 624. Alternatively, for example, the PID parameter KD can be increased from the first PID set to the second PID set, the PID parameter KI can be decreased from the first PID set to the second PID set, or a combination thereof.",
        "Although only certain embodiments of this invention have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of this invention. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention."
