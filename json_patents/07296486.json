    "abstract": "Angular movement detectors may be disposed within or proximate to joints in one or more members of articulated arms and linked via one or more communications networks to a controller to provide angular movement data to the controller for use in controlling movement of the articulated arm. The communications networks may be redundant. In an embodiment, the angular movement detector comprises a hydraulic motor drive sensor adapter which uses an eccentrically rotating main shaft to rotate a drive shaft to which the main shaft is loosely connected to further rotate a socket housing about a constant central axis. A trigger mounted in the socket housing generates a detectable field.",

        "This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/124,505, filed on May 6, 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,231,837.",
        "The present invention relates generally to the field of controllers. More specifically, the present invention discloses a hydraulic motor drive sensor adapter. In contemplated embodiments, the hydraulic motor drive sensor adapter may be used as part of an angular movement detector and a system of deploying such angular movement detectors useful in controlling movement of an articulated arm. In claimed embodiments, the angular movement detector comprises a hydraulic motor drive sensor adapter which uses an eccentrically rotating main shaft to rotate a drive shaft to which the main shaft is loosely connected to further rotate a socket housing about a constant central axis. A trigger mounted in the socket housing generates a detectable field.",
        "In existing manipulator or robotic arm designs, the angular displacement of one or more joints is monitored with a resolver, potentiometer, or other rotation sensor. These require some sort of mechanical connection, typically a shaft, between the moveable portion of the joint and the sensor. Sensors are typically held stationary by the non-moveable portion of the joint. In a subsea environment, mechanical connection, e.g. a shaft, must be equipped with a mechanical connection seal to prevent seawater intrusion into the sensor. This mechanical connection seal is prone to failure, thus resulting in the subsequent failure of the sensor.",
        "Further, existing solutions require discrete wiring for each sensor installed. Arms with large numbers of joint sensors require considerable wiring that can be difficult to install and maintain.",
        "Further, existing sensor types often require that some sort of host controller read analog values that are produced by the sensor, e.g. a resolver or potentiometer. This requires that the controller provide processing power to read, filter, and scale the readings of each of the sensors which have had to transmit analog signals over long, noise-prone conductors.",

        "Hydraulic motor drive sensor adapter 300 comprises motor body 301 which further comprises central channel 316 disposed at least partially through an internal portion of motor body 301.

        "Socket housing 312 is rotatably positioned about a constant axis within motor body 301 and further comprises top surface 150 and internal chamber 352. In preferred embodiments, this constant axis is aligned with central longitudinal axis 313 but does not have be so aligned.",
        "In preferred embodiments, socket housing 312 is made of the same material as main shaft 320. Preferably, socket housing 312 should be made of a softer bearing material to allow it to ride inside hollow plug 314. Hollow plug 314 is preferably made of stainless steel.",
        "One or more small slots (not shown in the figures) may be added along the length of socket housing 312 to aid in removing main shaft 320. Once oil penetrates the gap between socket housing 312 and hollow plug 314, suction will prevent easy removal of main shaft 320. A slot will allows air to intrude as hollow plug 314 is pulled out. A slot also aids in lubrication as main shaft 320 turns.",
        "Referring additionally to FIGS. 9 and 10, drive shaft 330 is disposed within an upper portion of central channel 316 and comprises lower region 331 loosely mounted in shaft receptacle 340 such that movement of lower region 331 of drive shaft 330 within shaft receptacle 340 is limited in a predetermined plane. Drive shaft 330 further comprises upper region 332 which is disposed opposite lower region 331 and is loosely mounted within internal chamber 352 such that movement of upper region 332 of drive shaft 330 within internal chamber 352 is limited a predetermined plane. In some preferred embodiments, these planes of limited movement are parallel. In other preferred embodiments they are not parallel.",
        "Drive shaft 330 may be a circular drive shaft, an elliptical drive shaft, an obround drive shaft, a splined drive shaft, or a polygonal drive shaft. Preferably, polygonal drive shafts 330 are used and comprise at least three sides with four sides being a common configuration.",
        "Trigger 54, preferably a magnet, is mounted on top surface 150 of socket housing 312 above upper region 332 of the drive shaft 330. In the preferred embodiment, magnet 54 may be removably fixed into place to allow replacement of magnet 54.",

        "Sensor 12 is disposed within a magnetic field generated by magnet 54 and the distance separating sensor 12 and magnet 54 remains constant in a predetermined plane. As noted above, sensor 12 may be an anisotropic magneto-restrictive sensor or a Hall-effect sensor or the like. In preferred embodiments, sensor 12 comprises a two-axis Hall-effect sensor adapted to sense rotation of magnet 54.",
        "In the operation of an exemplary embodiment, referring now to FIG. 7, sensors 12 mounted within or proximate angular movement detector 10 react to trigger 54, e.g. an electromagnetic field flux generated by electromagnetic field generator 54, to produce a signal representative of the triggering event, e.g. a change in the electromagnetic field flux. The signal may be translated into a digital representation and communicated via communications network 200 to controller 110 which may then interpret the digital representation to resolve angular movement of joint 50 in or about which angular movement detector 10 is disposed.",
        "Referring now to FIGS. 8 and 11, positional information from a moving body, e.g. joint 50 (FIG. 5) may be detected by connecting hydraulic motor drive sensor adapter 300 to a first moving component (e.g., 50b in FIG. 4), where hydraulic motor drive sensor adapter 300 is as described above. Sensor 12 is mounted to a second component (e.g., 50a in FIG. 4) disposed within a magnetic field generated by magnet 54. Main shaft 320 is rotated eccentrically about the central longitudinal axis and is used to rotate drive shaft 330. As seen herein, the second component may be viewed as remaining static with respect to a set of two or more planes which define its position in space and the first component may be movable with respect to the second component in that set of planes.",
        "In turn, draft shaft 330 is used to rotate socket housing 312 about a constant predetermined axis, e.g. central longitudinal axis 313. The rotation of magnet 54, held within in internal chamber 352 above upper region 332 of drive shaft 330, generates a magnetic field and sensor 12 is used to sense changes in the magnetic field and produce a signal representative of the triggering event, e.g. a change in the electromagnetic field flux. This signal may be translated into a digital representation and communicated via communications network 200 (FIG. 5) to controller 110 (FIG. 5) which may then interpret the digital representation to resolve angular movement of joint 50 (FIG. 5) in or about which hydraulic motor drive sensor adapter 300 is disposed.",
        "In a further embodiment, referring now to FIGS. 8 and 12, angular movement of a first moving component (e.g., 50b in FIG. 4) with respect to a second component (e.g., 50a in FIG. 4) where these components 50a, 50b are rotatably joined at joint 50 (FIG. 5) to effect motion in at least two planes, may be determined by eccentrically rotating main shaft 320 about central longitudinal axis 317 of central channel 316 of motor body 301 in which main shaft 320 is at least partially disposed and, accordingly, eccentrically rotating drive shaft 330, to which main shaft 320 is loosely connected, by the rotation of main shaft 320. The rotation of drive shaft 330 causes rotation of socket housing 312 about a constant central axis, e.g. central longitudinal axis 317, where drive shaft 330 is disposed within motor body 301 and loosely connected to socket housing 312. Rotating magnet 54 mounted in an internal chamber of socket housing 312 generates magnetic field which is detected by sensor 12 located within the generated magnetic field. The detected generated magnetic field is translated into digital data representative of the generated magnetic field, e.g. by sensor 12 or electronics 14 (FIG. 1) associated with sensor 12, which are then communicated to controller 110 (FIG. 5). The communicated digital data may then be used to effect a decision by controller 110 regarding further movement of the apparatuses to which sensor 12 and motor body 301 are connected, e.g. first movable component 50b and second component 50b.",
        "It will be understood that various changes in the details, materials, and arrangements of the parts which have been described and illustrated above in order to explain the nature of this invention may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the principle and scope of the invention as recited in the appended claims."
