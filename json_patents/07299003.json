        "The present document incorporates by reference the entire contents of Japanese priority documents, 2004-020658 filed in Japan on Jan. 29, 2004, and 2004-051437 filed in Japan on Feb. 26, 2004.",
        "1) Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a thermal fixing unit in an image forming apparatus such as a copying machine, a printer, and a facsimile, and particularly to a fixing unit in the form of a belt.",
        "2) Description of the Related Art",
        "There is a strong demand that the image forming apparatuses operate at high-speed and also consume less energy. One approach to achieve this is to improve the thermal efficiency of the fixing unit of the image forming apparatuses. The examples of the image forming apparatus are copying machines, printers, facsimile machines, and multifunction peripherals.",
        "In the image forming apparatuses, a toner image is formed on a recording medium generally by two methods: an image transfer method and a direct transfer method. The examples of the recording medium are an ordinary paper, a photosensitive paper, an electrostatic recording paper, and an OHP (overhead projector) sheet. The toner image is then fixed to the recording medium by a fixing unit. The fixing units mainly employ two methods to fix the toner image: a contact heating process and an electromagnetic induction heating process. The examples of the contact heating process are a heat roller process and a film heating process.",
        "The fixing unit that uses the heat roller process, basically includes a pair of rotating rollers: a fixing roller and a pressurizing roller. The fixing roller is heated by a heat source such as a halogen lamp. The pressurizing roller is in contact with the fixing roller and also applies pressure to the fixing roller. A paper with the toner image is introduced between the so called fixing nip, which is a contact portion of the pair of the rotating rollers, and then carried forward. The toner image is fused or fixed to the paper due to heat and pressure while the paper passes between the fixing roller and the pressurizing roller.",
        "A conventional fixing unit that uses the film heating process has been proposed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication Nos. S63-313182 and H1-263679. The fixing unit that uses the film heating process includes bringing the paper near a heating member while there is a heat-resistant, thin, fixing film between them, and allowing the paper to slide over the fixing film. The heating member can be a ceramic heater that includes a resistive layer on a ceramic substrate such as alumina and aluminum nitride that has properties such as high heat resistivity, insulation, and good thermal conductivity. Because the fixing film is thin and has a low thermal capacity, an efficiency of heat transfer is higher than that of the fixing unit that uses the heat roller process. Therefore, the warm-up time of the fixing unit that uses the film heating process is shorter. This allows a quicker start-up and energy conservation.",
        "Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. H8-22206 discloses a conventional fixing machine that uses the electromagnetic induction heating process. This fixing machine includes a magnetic metal member and a heating member. An alternating magnetic field is applied to the magnetic metal member. As a result, eddy currents are generated in the magnetic metal member and Joule's heat is produced in the magnetic metal member. The metal member is heated by the Joule's heat.",
        "Various toners are used in the fixing unit that uses the electromagnetic induction heating process. For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. H11-344830 proposes a toner that includes a strong magnetic material and a resin that has a glass transition point in a range of 45\u00b0 C. to 65\u00b0 C. and a softening point in a range of 80\u00b0 C. to 140\u00b0 C.",
        "Moreover, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. 2001-235893 proposes a toner that includes a styrene-acrylic resin in which the glass transition point and an MI value are regulated, and a fixed polyolefin wax are used.",
        "Furthermore, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication No.2001-272812 proposes a toner that includes a polyester resin that has a regulated endothermic peak of wax and a regulated dynamic viscoelasticity is used.",
        "Moreover, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. 2001-272818 proposes a toner of which a molecular weight distribution and an endothermic peak temperature are regulated.",
        "Furthermore, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. 2002-91075 proposes a toner that includes a resin in which a composition of both acid and alcohol are regulated.",
        "Moreover, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. 2002-91076 discloses a toner of which the melt viscosity is regulated and includes a polyester resin in which an insoluble content of THF (tetrahydrofuran) and an acid value are regulated.",
        "Moreover, a technology in which a low temperature offset and a high temperature offset are prevented by regulating a heat capacity of a belt, has been disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 2813297.",
        "Furthermore, a technology in which a separation is improved by improving a permeating property of a mold releasing agent by using a spherical shaped toner that contains a mold releasing agent that has a low melting point, in a heating passage before the nip of the belt fixing unit, has been disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 3423616.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to propose a fixing unit that enables speedy start-up and energy conservation.",
        "A fixing unit according to an aspect of the present invention includes an endless fixing belt having a heat generating layer of a thickness not more than 40 \u03bcm and a releasing layer of a thickness not less than 10 \u03bcm; a heating unit that heats the fixing belt with electromagnetic induction; a fixing member and a pressurizing member that are in a pressed contact, wherein the fixing belt passes through a nip between the fixing member and the pressurizing member, and a recording material that holds an unfixed toner image is passed through the nip to fix the toner image. A toner to form the toner image includes at least a binder resin, a colorant, and a mold releasing agent, and has a glass transition temperature in a range of 35\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C. and an outflow-start temperature in a range of 80\u00b0 C. to 110\u00b0 C.",
        "A fixing unit according to another aspect of the present invention includes a transferring and fixing member that includes a rotating body in a form of a roller or a belt on which a toner image is transferred; a heating unit that heats a toner on the transferring and fixing member; and a pressurizing roller that forms a nip with the transferring and fixing member.

        "Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to the accompanying diagrams.",
        "A fixing unit according to the present invention has a sufficiently wide fixing nip, which enables a fixing at low temperature. Moreover, a fixing belt that has a low heat capacity is used and one or both of the fixing belt and the fixing nip that is formed by a fixing member (fixing roller, fixed fixing member) and a pressurizing member (pressurizing roller, fixed pressurizing member) are let to be thermal insulated. With such a structure, by using an appropriate combination with a toner, the fixing unit realizes high speed start-up and energy conservation. Moreover, an excellent fixity and prevention of offset is achieved.",
        "In particular, a thermal insulating roller (in this case, defined as a roller that has an Asker hardness not less than 80 degrees) that has stiffness is used as a pressurizing member. A pressurizing roller that has hardness greater than the hardness of the fixing member is used. By doing so, a transporting by the fixing belt becomes stable and since the fixing nip is formed in a direction such that a paper is not rolled around the belt, there is an improvement in a separation of paper.",
        "As a thermal insulating structure for the fixing member or the pressurizing member, a foamed silicone rubber or a silicone layer filled with a hollow thread and hollow particles is used. Such a thermal insulating structure improves a rate of air content, thereby enabling to improve an air thermal-insulating effect.",
        "Moreover, the structure of the silicone layer filled with the hollow thread and the hollow particles has a greater surface hardness of the roller, and smaller compression permanent set, and can be used as a roller to drive the fixing belt.",
        "The fixing belt used in the fixing unit according to the present invention is a low heat capacity belt that has a heat generating layer of a thickness not greater than 40 micrometer (\u03bcm) and a releasing layer of thickness not less than 10 \u03bcm. If the thickness of the heat generating layer (a conductive material of a metal such as nickel and stainless steel) is greater than 40 \u03bcm, there is an increase in the stiffness of the belt and a flexibility that is a peculiarity of the belt is lost, thereby affecting the winding around the fixing member and the formation of the nip. As a result, the separation and fixity are declined. Therefore, according to the present invention, the thickness of the heat generating layer is not let to be greater than 40 \u03bcm. Moreover, to ensure an abrasion resistance with the lapse of time of a surface releasing layer of the fixing belt, the surface releasing layer has to be at least 10-\u03bcm thick.",
        "Because the fixing belt that has low heat capacity and a toner that includes at least a binder resin, a colorant, and a mold releasing agent, with a glass transition temperature in a range of 35 degree centigrade (\u00b0 C.) to 50\u00b0 C. and an outflow-start temperature in a range of 80\u00b0 C. to 110\u00b0 C. are used, a high speed start-up and the energy conservation as well as excellent fixity and prevention of offset are achieved.",
        "Incidentally, a problem peculiar to the fixing belt that is heated by an induction heating process is that, as compared to a conventional belt for a radiant heat source (halogen lamp), the stiffness of the belt is more due to the heat generating layer. (metallic conductive material). For this reason, a width of the nip becomes small and a quality of fixing (fixity, gloss, and high image quality) is deteriorated. Moreover, if a bearing in the nip is low, there is a tendency of deterioration of the quality of fixing.",
        "Therefore, to ensure a predetermined nip width in a belt fixing by the induction heating process, in a case of a belt that has high stiffness and high surface hardness, even higher fixing pressure (bearing) is required to be exerted.",
        "However, on the other hand, increasing the bearing leads to an improvement in the quality of fixing (fixity, gloss, and high image quality) and a fixing temperature can also be lowered, which is another advantage. In other words, it was revealed that it is effective for energy conservation and high speed start-up.",
        "Inventors of the present invention, carried out experiments by using nine types of fixing belts shown in table 1 below, with a structure that has layers such as the heat generating layer (with Ni (nickel), Ag (silver), and stainless steel as a conductive material), an intermediate layer (an elastic layer for uniform fixing), and an outer layer (a fluorine-contained resin used for a release effect and an oil less) superimposed on a base substrate of Ni or PI (polyimide). When the base substrate is Ni, a separate heat generating layer need not be provided (belt nos. 2 to 4). In a belt No. 3, the intermediate layer of silicone rubber serves as the outer layer (releasing) layer.",

A transit time of the paper through the nip is 100 ms. Toners from toner No. 1 to toner No. 3 described later were used.

        "As a result of the experiments, it was revealed that if the heat capacity of the fixing belt 101 is not greater than 0.017 J/K\u00b7cm2, a decrease in temperature in the nip is greater and the fixity deteriorates. This can be prevented by increasing the fixing temperature. However, by doing so, the fixing temperature becomes high, the start-up time becomes long, and the energy conservation cannot be achieved. It was also revealed that if the heat capacity of the fixing belt is not less than 0.077 J/K\u00b7cm2, similarly the start-up time becomes long and the energy conservation cannot be achieved. Nowadays, the start-up time not longer than 30 seconds, and desirably not longer than 10 seconds, has been sought after.",
        "The fixing roller, which is a fixing member that forms the nip, may be elastic foam body (such as silicone rubber). Moreover, it is desirable that the pressurizing roller is a thin roller (thickness of core not greater than 1 mm) with low heat capacity or a roller that has a thermal insulating structure. A heat loss can be reduced by decreasing heat conductivity from the heating belt to the pressurizing roller, and a heating efficiency of the belt can be improved.",
        "An evaluation experiment was carried out for comparison by using a fixing unit that has a conventional structure.",
        "The fixing unit with the conventional structure uses the so called heat roller process in which a fixing roller (heat roller) and a pressurizing roller are allowed to make a pressed contact. The fixing roller is a hollow core with silicone rubber and fluorine contained resin coated on it as the elastic layer and the releasing layer respectively, which is used normally as a heat roller for color fixing. The roller has a built-in halogen lamp as a source of heat that supplies heat from the inside of the roller to a surface of the roller. Concretely, the base substrate of the fixing roller is made of 2-mm thick iron or stainless steel on which 2-mm thick layer of silicone rubber and 20-\u03bcm thick layer of fluorine-contained resin are coated. The heat capacity of this fixing roller is 1.04 J/K\u00b7cm2.",
        "In this evaluation experiment, the start-up time was in a range of 5 minutes to 10 minutes (when the roller diameter is let to be in a range of 40 mm to 60 mm) which was much slower than the start-up time in the induction heating process.",
        "Apart from this, the induction heating process normally has the following characteristics as compared to a radiant heating process (by using the source of light such as halogen lamp).\n\n    \n    \n        (1) The induction heating process has high energy conversion efficiency. It is possible to have 85% energy conversion efficiency in the induction heating, which is approximately 10% by using the halogen lamp. Therefore, as a matter of course, the start-up in the induction heating process is quick.\n        (2) In the induction heating process, variable output is possible by a variable control of frequency of electric power that is supplied to a heating coil, which is difficult with the halogen lamp.\n        (3) In the induction heating process, it is possible to perform a self temperature control in which magnetic properties (Curie point) of a heated product are used and it is advantageous from a point of view of a safety of burning and ignition.\n        (4) In the induction heating process, a temperature ripple is less (as an object to be heated is heated directly, there are advantages such as a small time lag for temperature control).\n        (5) The induction heating process is less risky as far as safety point is considered (however there is a possibility of ignition due to wrapping of the paper due to an external local heating process), whereas the radiant heat source causes many problems.",
        "The following is a description of a toner that is used in the fixing unit according to the present invention.",
        "Many characteristics of toner related to the fixity of toner are known. Among these characteristics, a \u00bd outflow temperature (softening point) is known to be related to the fixity. However, according to the present invention, no relevance has been seen between the \u00bd outflow temperature (softening point) and the fixity, and it was revealed that a good fixity can be achieved by using a toner that satisfies both of the characteristics viz. the glass transition temperature in a range of 35\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C. and the outflow-start temperature in a range of 80\u00b0 C. to 110\u00b0 C.",
        "If the glass transition temperature is lower than 35\u00b0 C., sometimes there is an occurrence of offset during fixing. On the other hand, if the glass transition temperature is higher than 50\u00b0 C., no sufficient fixity can be achieved and an image tends to come off easily from a transfer paper. Moreover, if the outflow-start temperature is lower than 80\u00b0 C., sometimes there is an occurrence of offset during fixing. On the other hand, if the outflow-start temperature is higher than 110\u00b0 C., no sufficient fixity can be achieved and the image tends to come off easily from the transfer paper.",
        "An object of the present invention can be achieved assuredly by maintaining a peak molecular weight of the toner in a range of 3000 to 8000. In other words, if the peak molecular weight is less than 3000, sometimes there is an occurrence of offset while fixing. On the other hand, if the peak molecular weight is greater than 8000, no sufficient fixity can be achieved and the image tends to come off easily from the transfer paper.",
        "The following is a general description of a method for measurement of the glass transition point Tg.",
        "TG-DSC system TAS-100 manufactured by RIGAKU CORPORATION was used as an apparatus to measure the glass transition point Tg.",
        "To start with, about 10 mg of a sample is put in a sample container made of aluminum and the sample container is mounted on a holder unit. The holder unit is set in an electric furnace. The sample is heated by raising a temperature from a room temperature to 150\u00b0 C. at a programming rate of 10\u00b0 C./min and left to be at 150\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes. Then the sample is cooled down to the room temperature and left to be at the room temperature for 10 minutes. The sample is heated again in a nitrogen atmosphere up to 150\u00b0 C. at the programming rate of 10\u00b0 C./min and a DSC measurement was carried out. The glass transition point Tg was calculated from a point of contact of a tangent of an endothermic curve near the glass transition point Tg and a base line, by using an analysis system in TAS-100 system.",

        "The outflow-start temperature of toner can be measured by using a flow tester. An elevated flow tester CFT500D manufactured by SHIMADZU SEISAKUSHO can be used. Each temperature can be read from a flow curve of this flow tester. Conditions for measurement were let to be, load: 5 kg/cm2, programming rate: 3.0\u00b0 C./min, bore diameter of die: 1.00 mm, and length of die: 10.0 mm.",
        "The peak molecular weight of a toner component is measured by the following method.",
        "About 1 gram (g) of a toner is weighed precisely in an Erlenmeyer flask and 10 g to 20 g of THF (tetrahydrofuran) is added to it to make a THF solution with 5% to 10% binder concentration. A column is allowed to be stabilized in a heat chamber at 40\u00b0 C. THF is poured as a solvent at a rate of flow 1 ml/min to the column at 40\u00b0 C. and 20 \u03bcl of the THF sample solution is poured. The molecular weight of the sample is calculated from a relationship between a retention time and a logarithmic value of a calibration curve that is prepared by a monodispersed polystyrene standard sample.",
        "The calibration curve is prepared by using a polystyrene standard sample. A monodispersed polystyrene standard sample with the molecular weight in a range of 2.7\u00d7102 to 6.2\u00d7102 manufactured by TOSOH CORPORATION is to be used.",

Regarding the montan wax, a refined montan wax rather than a normal mineral wax and similar to the carnauba wax, having micro crystals and acid value from 5 to 14, is desirable. The oxidized rice wax is an air oxidized rice bran wax and it is desirable that it has an acid value in a range of 10 to 30. If the acid value of each wax is below this range, a low temperature fixing temperature rises and the fixing at a low temperature becomes insufficient.

An amount of the wax to be added is from 1 part by weight to 15 parts by weight for 100 parts by weight of the binder resin and the desirable amount is in a range of 3 parts by weight to 10 parts by weight.

        "Resin powders such as styrene-acrylic copolymers, silicone resins, maleic acid resins, fluorine contained resins, polyester resins, and epoxy resins can be used for coating the carrier. In a case of the styrene-acrylic resins, it is desirable to use a copolymer resin that has styrene content in a range of 30 percent by weight to 90 percent by weight. In this case, if the styrene content is less than 30 percent by weight, developing characteristics are poor and if the styrene content is more than 90 percent by weight, a coating film becomes hard and tends to come off easily, thereby shortening a life of the carrier. Moreover, apart from the resins mentioned above, an adhesive agent, a hardening agent, a lubricant, a conductive agent, and a charge controlling agent may be included in a resin coating of the carrier.",

As a method of forming a silicone resin layer, the silicone resin may be applied on a surface of the carrier nucleon by a method such as spraying and soaking.",
        "Next, a concrete structure of the fixing unit is described with reference to the following embodiment.",
        "FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of a structure of main components of a fixing unit 50 according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The fixing unit 50 includes a fixing belt 51, a heating roller 52, a fixing roller 53, an induction-heating unit 54, and a pressurizing roller 55. The fixing belt 51 is stretched over the heating roller 52 and the fixing roller 53 and is heated via the heating roller 52 that is heated by the induction-heating unit 54. The fixing belt 51 is an endless heat resistant belt that is rotated in a counterclockwise direction as shown by an arrow, by rotation of either the heating roller 52 or the fixing roller 53. The pressurizing roller 55 is in a pressed contact with the fixing roller 53 via the fixing belt 51, and is driven and rotated by the fixing roller 53.",
        "The heating roller 52 is made of a hollow circular cylindrical magnetic metal member of a metal such as iron and cobalt or an alloy of such metals. A diameter of the heating roller is in a range of 20 mm to 40 mm, a thickness is in a range of 0.3 mm to 1.0 mm, and has a structure that has low heat capacity, and its temperature rises quickly.",
        "The fixing roller 53 includes a core 53a made of a metal such as stainless steel, which is coated by an elastic member 53b. The elastic member 53b includes heat resistant silicone rubber in a solid form or in the form of foam. The fixing roller 53 is let to be bigger than the heating roller 55 by letting an outer diameter to be in a range of 20 mm to 40 mm for forming a contact portion that has a predetermined width, between the pressurizing roller 55 and the fixing roller 53, by a thrust exerted by the pressurizing roller 55. A thickness of the elastic member 53b is in a range of 4 mm to 6 mm and a hardness of the elastic member 53b is in a range of 10 Asker to 50 Asker (Asker hardness).",
        "Since a heat capacity of the heating roller 52 is less than a heat capacity of the fixing roller 53, the heating roller 52 is heated rapidly and a warm-up time becomes short. The fixing belt 51 that is stretched over the heating roller 52 and the fixing roller 53 is heated at a contact portion W with the heating roller 52 that is heated by the induction-heating unit 54. An inner surface of the fixing belt 51 is heated continuously by rotation of the heating roller 52 and the fixing roller 53, and as a result of this, the entire fixing belt 51 is heated.",
        "Thus, the fixing belt 51 has a structure that includes a heat generating layer, an intermediate layer (elastic layer), and a releasing layer (outer layer). It is desirable that a thickness of the releasing layer is in a range of 10 \u03bcm to 300 \u03bcm, and the thickness of 200 \u03bcm is particularly desirable. With such a structure, since a toner image T formed on the paper P is rolled sufficiently on the outer layer portion of the fixing belt 51, the toner image T can be heated and fused uniformly. To ensure an abrasion resistance with lapsing of time, it is necessary that the releasing layer on an outer surface is at least 10-\u03bcm thick. Moreover, if the thickness of the releasing layer is greater than 300 \u03bcm, the heat capacity of the belt becomes bigger and the warm-up time becomes longer. Furthermore, during fixing of the toner, a temperature of the surface of the belt is hard to go down and the toner that is fused at an outlet of the fixing portion cannot be coagulated. Therefore, there is a decline in a release ability of the belt and the toner is adhered to-the belt, thereby causing the so called hot offset. As a substrate material of the fixing belt 51, instead of the heat generating layer formed by the metal, a heat resistant resin layer formed by a resin such as a fluorine contained resin, a polyimide resin, a polyamide resin, a polyamide imide resin, a PEEK (polyether ether ketone) resin, a PES (polyether sulfone) resin, and a PPS (polyphenylene sulfide) resin may be used.",
        "The pressurizing roller 55 includes a core 55a and an elastic member 55b provided on the core 55a. The core 55a is a circular cylindrical member made of a metal that has high thermal conductivity, such as copper or aluminum. The elastic member 55b has high toner release ability. Stainless steel may also be used apart from the metals mentioned above for the core 55a. The pressurizing roller 55 is in a pressed contact with the fixing roller 53 via the fixing belt 51, thereby forming a fixing nip N. In the first embodiment, by letting the hardness of the pressurizing roller 55 to be more than that of the fixing roller 53, the pressurizing roller 55 is pressed by the fixing roller 53 (and the fixing belt 51) forming a dent on the pressurizing roller 55. Due to the dent formed, since the paper P runs, along a peripheral shape of a surface of the pressurizing roller 55, the paper P is released easily from a surface of the fixing belt 51. An outer diameter of the pressurizing roller 55 is in a range of 20 mm to 40 mm, which is same as that of the fixing roller. However, a thickness of the elastic layer is less than that of the fixing roller 53 and is in a range of 0.5 mm to 2.0 mm. A hardness of the pressurizing roller 55 is in a range of 80 Asker to 100 Asker (Asker hardness), and is more than that of the fixing roller 53.",
        "As a thermal insulating structure of the fixing roller 53 or the pressurizing roller 55, a hollow thread and hollow particles are filled in a foamed silicone rubber or in the silicone layer to improve the rate of air content thereby enabling to improve the air thermal-insulating effect. Moreover, the structure of the silicone layer filled with the hollow thread and the hollow particles has a greater surface hardness of the roller, a smaller compression permanent set, and can be used as a roller to drive the fixing belt 51.",
        "The induction-heating unit 54 that heats the heating roller 52 by electromagnetic induction includes an exciting coil 56, which is a magnetic field generating unit and a coil guide plate 57 on which the exciting coil 56 is wound. The coil guide plate 57 is a semi-cylindrical shaped guide that is spaced closely from an outer peripheral surface of the heating roller 52. The exciting coil 56 is one continuous long exciting coil wire that is wound alternately in an axial direction of the heating roller along the coil guide plate 57. Moreover, the exciting coil 56 is connected to a driving power supply (not shown in the diagram) that has a frequency variable oscillation circuit. A semi-cylindrical shaped exciting coil core 58 made of a ferromagnetic material such as ferrite is spaced closely from the exciting coil 56 and is fixed to a core supporting member 59. According to the first embodiment, the exciting coil core 58 has a relative magnetic permeability 2500. A high frequency alternating current in a range of 10 kHz to 1 MHz, desirably in a range of 20 kHz to 800 kHz is supplied to the exciting coil 56 from the driving power supply and an alternating magnetic field is generated.",
        "At the contact portion W of the heating roller 52 and the heat resistant fixing belt 51, and in an area near the contact portion W, the alternating magnetic field acts as the heat generating layer of the heating roller 52 and the fixing belt 51 and eddy current [I] flows in a direction that hinders change in the alternating magnetic field inside. The eddy current [I] generates Joule's heat according to a resistance of the heat generating layer of the fixing belt 51 and the heating roller 52 and the heating roller 52 and the fixing belt 51 that has the heat generating layer are heated by electromagnetic induction in mainly the contact portion W of the heating roller 52 and the fixing belt 51 and the area near the contact portion W. Thus, a temperature of the inner surface of the fixing belt 51 that is heated, is detected by a temperature detecting unit 59 that includes a thermo sensitive element that has high thermal response, such as a thermistor that is disposed such that it is in contact with the inner surface side of the fixing belt 51 in an area near an inlet of the fixing nip N.",
        "FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of a structure of main components of a fixing unit according to a second embodiment of the present invention. A fixing unit 60 shown in this diagram includes a fixing belt 61, a fixing thrust member 63, an induction-heating unit 64, and a pressurizing member 65, which are accommodated in a fixing casing that is not shown in the diagram. The fixing belt 61 is similar to the fixing belt 51 according to the first embodiment and has at least a releasing layer that has a thickness not greater than 40 \u03bcm and a heat generating layer that has a thickness not less than 10 \u03bcm. According to the second embodiment, the heat capacity of the fixing belt 61 is in a range of 0.017 J/K\u00b7cm2 to 0.077 J/K\u00b7cm2. The fixing belt 61 is guided by guiding members that are not shown in the diagram, which are disposed at both ends in a cylindrical axial direction (a direction perpendicular to a surface of the diagram) so that the fixing belt 61 maintains roughly a cylindrical shape during rotation.",
        "The fixing thrust member 63 includes a holder 65 that is a supporting member, an insulating member 66, a heat resistant elastic member 67, and a protective sheet 68. The fixing thrust member 63 is fixed and does not rotate. The fixing thrust member 63 is disposed facing a pressurizing roller 65, which is a pressurizing member, such that the heat resistant elastic member 67 is in contact with the fixing belt 61 via the protective sheet 68. The fixing thrust member 63 is pressed with a constant welding force against the pressurizing roller 65 with the fixing belt 61 sandwiched between the two. In other words, a fixing nip is formed by a pressed contact between the heat resistant elastic member 67 and the pressurizing roller 65 of the fixing thrust member, via the fixing belt 61.",
        "The pressurizing roller 65 includes a core on which a hard foam layer is provided and the hardness of the pressurizing roller 65 is greater than the hardness of the (heat resistant elastic member 67 of the) fixing thrust member 63. The pressurizing roller 65 is driven and rotated in a counterclockwise direction by a drive mechanism that is not shown in the diagram. As the pressurizing roller 65 rotates, the fixing belt 61 is rotated in a clockwise direction in the diagram. In a structure according to the second embodiment, it is desirable to rotate the fixing belt by a transmission of drive from the pressurizing roller 65.",
        "The pressurizing roller 65 according to the present invention has the insulating structure that includes the core on which the hard foam layer is provided. As the thermal insulating structure, the foamed silicone rubber or the silicone layer filled with the hollow thread and the hollow particles is used. Such a thermal insulating structure improves the rate of air content, thereby enabling to improve the air thermal-insulating effect. The structure of the silicone layer filled with the hollow thread and the hollow particles has a greater surface hardness of the roller, a smaller compression permanent set, and is suitable to be used as a roller to drive the fixing belt 61.",
        "The fixing thrust member 63 is protected by the protective sheet 68 that is provided such that it covers from a side surface of one of sides of the holler 65, then turning around a bottom surface of the heat resistant elastic member 67 up to a side surface of another side of the holler 65. When the fixing belt 61 rotates, an inner peripheral surface rotates while performing friction sliding with the protective sheet 68. By letting the protective sheet 68 to be a heat resistant film material that has low friction and excellent sliding property, it is possible to reduce a sliding resistance during the rotation of the belt. By reducing the sliding resistance between the fixing belt 61 and (the heat resistant elastic member 67 of) the fixing thrust member 63, it is possible to prevent a slip of the fixing belt 61 that is driven and rotated by the pressurizing roller 65. Moreover, it is also useful for preventing friction of the heat resistant elastic member 67.",
        "Materials such as PI (polyimide), glass fiber, PIA (polyimide amide), PES (polyether sulfone), and PEEK (polyether ether ketone) can be used as a material for the protective sheet 68. The protective sheet 68 may also be coated by a material that includes a fluorine contained resin of these materials.",
        "In the fixing unit 60 that has such a structure, by allowing a recording paper P that holds an unfixed toner image T, to pass through the fixing nip that is formed by a pressed contact between the fixing belt 61 and the pressurizing roller 65 by the fixing thrust member 63, the unfixed toner is fixed on the recording paper P due to heat and pressure. A temperature detecting unit 69 such as a thermistor is provided such that it is in contact with or near the outer peripheral surface of the fixing belt 61. Based on a temperature of the fixing belt 61 that is detected by the temperature detecting unit 69, an output of the induction-heating unit 64 is controlled.",

The fixing unit 80 is the same as the fixing unit 70 according to the third embodiment except for a fixing belt 81 that is stretched around a periphery of the fixing thrust member 83.

        "The fixity of the toners-was judged by a lower limit temperature for fixing. An experiment to measure the lower limit temperature for fixing was carried out as follows.",
        "By using the experiment equipment, a copy test was performed by setting a paper of type 6200 manufactured by RICOH COMPANY LIMITED. A fixing roller temperature at which a survival rate of image density upon rubbing a fixed image by using a pad is not less than 70% is let to be the lower limit temperature for fixing. Moreover, if the fixing temperature is raised up, due to excessive fusion of the toner, all the toner is remained on the fixing belt without being fixed on a transfer material such as a paper. This remained toner adheres to a non-image area, thereby giving rise to the so called offset phenomenon. A range of fixing temperature indicates a range from a lower limit temperature for fixing to-an upper limit temperature at which no offset phenomenon occurs.

        "The toner image T that is transferred to the transferring and fixing belt 13 from the intermediate transfer belt 2 is heated by the induction heating source 21 on the transferring and fixing belt till the toner image T is fixed on the paper P. Thus, with such a structure, since only the toner T can be heated sufficiently ahead of fixing, it is possible to lower the fixing temperature as compared to a conventional way of heating the toner T and the paper P simultaneously. As a result of an experiment, it was confirmed that a sufficiently appropriate image quality can be achieved even at a low temperature range from 80\u00b0 C. to 120\u00b0 C. of the transferring and fixing belt 13.",
        "Thus, the fixing unit 12 according to this embodiment has a function of unfixed toner getting transferred and is positioned as a transferring and fixing unit unlike the conventional fixing unit that merely heats and pressurizes a paper that holds a unfixed toner image.",

        "The fixing roller 15 includes a core 15a made of a metal such as stainless steel, which is coated by an elastic member 15b. The elastic member 15b includes heat resistant silicone rubber in solid form or in the form of foam. A thickness of the elastic member 15b is in a range of 4 mm to 6 mm and a hardness of the elastic member 15b is in a range of 10 degrees to 50 degrees (Asker hardness).",
        "A portion where the intermediate transfer belt 2 and the transferring and fixing belt 13 that is stretched over the fixing roller 15, face one another is supported by a bias roller, which is a bias applying unit that applies bias on the intermediate transfer belt 2. A bias of the same polarity as that of the toner T is applied such that an electric field in which the toner T is absorbed electrostatically to the transferring and fixing belt 13 in the transfer nip N, is generated at the bias roller that is positioned at a position of transfer and an electrostatic repulsion is imparted to the toner.",
        "The induction heating source 21 that heats the toner T on the transferring and fixing belt 13 includes an exciting coil that is a magnetic field generating unit, and a coil guide plate on which the exciting coil is wound. The exciting coil is connected to a driving power supply that has an oscillating circuit with a variable frequency. A high-frequency ac power in a range of 10 kHz to 1 MHz, desirably in a range of 20 kHz to 800 kHz is fed to the exciting coil from the driving power supply, thereby generating an alternating magnetic field. At a surface facing the transferring and fixing belt 13, the alternating magnetic field acts as a heat generating layer of the transferring and fixing belt 13, and eddy current flows in a direction that hinders change in the alternating magnetic field inside. The eddy current generates Joule's heat according to a resistance of the heat generating layer of the transferring and fixing belt 13 and heats the toner T on the transferring and fixing belt 13. Thus, since the toner T on the transferring and fixing belt 13 is heated directly, it is possible to start-up the unit instantaneously. The induction heating source 21 is desirable as it has high energy efficiency and an output can be changed by varying the frequency. Moreover, it is possible to perform the self temperature control in which the magnetic properties (Curie point) of the heated product are used and it is advantageous from the point of view of the safety of burning and ignition.",
        "FIG. 9 is a diagram of a structure of another fixing unit. In FIG. 8, a unit for heating the toner T on the transferring and fixing belt 13 is the induction heating source 21, which can be a radiant heat source 22 as shown in FIG. 9. An example of the radiant heat source 22 is a halogen lamp. When toner is heated directly from a surface of the toner by the radiant heat source 22, an offset preventing effect is achieved. In other words, while transferring to and fixing on a paper by heating the surface of the toner for a long time, with an interfacial temperature between the transferring and fixing belt and the toner lower than an interfacial temperature between the paper and the toner, a small temperature gradient in the toner layer, and a uniform fusing are effective against the hot offset.",
        "Moreover, by allowing either any one or both of the transferring and fixing belt 13 and the pressurizing roller 14 to have a thermal insulating structure, a heat loss can be reduced, a heating efficiency of the transferring and fixing belt 13 can be improved, and even more energy can be saved.",
        "Particularly, it is desirable that the pressurizing roller 14 has the thermal insulating structure. Examples of the thermal insulating structure are a foamed silicone rubber or a silicone layer filled with the hollow thread and hollow particles that improve the rate of air content, thereby enabling to improve the air thermal-insulating effect. A hard porous roller has such a thermal insulating structure. By letting the hard porous roller to be the pressurizing roller, it is possible to have a greater surface hardness, a small compression set, and it can be used as a belt drive roller. A desirable hardness of the pressurizing roller is not less than 80 degree in Asker hardness.",
        "Thus, by using the hard porous roller as the pressurizing roller 14 and making it harder than the transferring and fixing belt 13, a transportability of the transferring and fixing belt 13 is stabilized and since the fixing nip is formed in a direction in which the paper is not rolled on the transferring and fixing belt 13, there is an improvement in a paper separation. Furthermore, since the toner is not heated excessively as it moves with a peripheral surface of the transferring and fixing belt 13, the offset is prevented from occurring.",
        "A structure of the transferring and fixing belt 13 is described below.",
        "The transferring and fixing belt 13 includes a substrate provided with a heat generating layer, a surface of which is coated by a releasing layer. If the substrate is made of Ni or stainless steel, it is desirable that the thickness of the substrate is not greater than 40 \u03bcm. If the substrate is made of a heat resistant resin material, it is desirable that the thickness of the substrate is not greater than 100 \u03bcm. If the thickness of the substrate is greater that 100 \u03bcm, there is an increase in the stiffness of the belt, the flexibility that is a peculiarity of the belt is lost, and the running of the belt around the fixing roller and a nip formation are deteriorated. As a result of this, there is a deterioration of the paper separation and the toner fixity. The heat generating layer is made of a conductive material such as Ni, Ag, and stainless steel. An elastic layer that is made of silicone rubber may be provided as an intermediate layer on the heat generating layer to allow the toner image to be fixed uniformly.",
        "The releasing layer that is provided on the surface of the belt is made of a fluorine contained resin and has to be at least 10-\u03bcm thick to ensure the abrasion resistance with the lapse of time.",

Therefore, this can be prevented by increasing the fixing temperature. However, with the increase in the fixing temperature, the energy conservation (high-speed start-up) cannot be achieved.

        "From the result is table 5, when the toners 1 to 3 according to the present invention were used, the lower limit temperature for fixing could be reduced and a range of fixing temperature not below a certain temperature could be achieved. This enables to reduce the start-up time of the unit by a great extent and to save even more energy. In addition to this, defective fixing and hot offset do not occur and a good fixity of the image can be achieved.",
        "According to a fixing unit and an image forming apparatus of the present invention, by heating a fixing belt that has a low heat capacity by an induction-heating unit it is possible to shorten a start-up time and to save energy. Moreover, by using a low temperature fixing toner both of the fixity and the prevention of offset can be achieved.",
        "According to a second aspect of the present invention, since the heat capacity of the fixing belt is in a range of 0.017 J/K\u00b7cm2 to 0.077 J/K\u00b7cm2, with a suitable combination of the toner, it is possible to save energy and shorten the start-up time. Moreover, the fixity and the prevention of offset can be achieved.",
        "According to a third aspect of the present invention, since a peak molecular weight of the toner is in a range of 3000 to 8000, this contributes to shortening of the start-up time as well as has a good effect on heat resistance and durability of the belt. Further, it has excellent paper adaptability and a defective fixing and offset cannot occur easily.",
        "According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, out of a fixing member and a pressurizing member, since at least the fixing member has a thermal insulation structure, conduction of heat from the fixing belt is less and heat loss is reduced, thereby enable to improve the heating efficiency.",
        "According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, the fixing member is disposed inside a loop of the fixing belt and hardness of the pressurizing member is let to be more than that of the fixing member. Therefore, the nip can be formed in a direction such that the paper cannot get wrapped around the fixing belt and there is an improvement in a paper separating ability.",
        "According to a sixth aspect of the present invention, the pressurizing member is a pressurizing roller and the fixing belt is rotated by a drive transmitted from the pressurizing roller. Therefore, transportation by the fixing belt is stable.",
        "According to the present invention, a lower limit temperature for fixing can be reduced and a range of fixing temperature not less than a certain temperature can be maintained. Therefore, it is possible to provide a fixing unit that starts up instantaneously and saves even more energy, as well as avoids an occurrence of defective fixing and hot offset, and achieves good fixity.",
        "Although the invention has been described with respect to a specific embodiment for a complete and clear disclosure, the appended claims are not to be thus limited but are to be construed as embodying all modifications and alternative constructions that may occur to one skilled in the art that fairly fall within the basic teaching herein set forth."
