        "This nonprovisional application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/418,704, filed Oct. 17, 2002.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a device for cleaning, compounding, polishing, brushing, burnishing and buffing that uses extending material elements, and in particular, to a device that accomplishes such results using the rotary motion of a plurality of standard-sized, disposable shop towels, paper towels, or surgical towels that are readily available at commercial vendors.",
        "2. Background of the Technology",
        "Many devices for buffing only operate when the buffing materials are pressed against the material to be buffed, and are thus difficult to use for at least this reason. The following devices exemplify these types of buffing devices. U.S. Pat. No. 5,890,249 to Hoffman discloses a multi-purpose vibrational cleaning, scrubbing, buffing, and polishing device. U.S. Pat. No. 5,477,582 to Yamashita discloses a mop sheet holder and a corresponding mop sheet. U.S. Pat. No. 3,869,833 to Belanger discloses a rotary finishing wheel. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,298,517 and 6,405,403 to McKay disclose a cleaning tool with removable cleaning sheets. U.S. Pat. No. 5,542,352 to Blackman, et al., discloses a method and apparatus for cleaning, wiping, scouring, and abrading.",
        "Additionally, conventional buffing devices may extend radially from the central axis, but the buffing sheets are typically not readily disposable or otherwise easy to obtain, and instead must be custom manufactured to fit the device. The following patents disclose these types of devices. U.S. Pat. No. 2,805,530 to Schaffner discloses a wheel-shaped, rotary finishing apparatus that may be used to buff. U.S. Pat. No. 5,560,744 to Schaffner III discloses a rotary buffing wheel in which layers of fabric attached to the wheel extend radially from the central axis of the wheel.",
        "Some buffing devices, in which the buffing materials extend radially from the body, secure the buffing materials to the body, which is located on the central axis of the device, by using fastening devices, rather than friction, which for example, may unnecessarily complicate the device to make it difficult to use. Examples of these types of devices include the following. U.S. Pat. No. 6,295,687 to Dehart discloses a buff section assembly and method of making the assembly. U.S. Pat. No. 2,423,992 to Nordgren et al. discloses a rotary buffing tool in which wiping elements rotate about a rotary shank.",
        "Many embodiments of conventional buffing devices, in which the buffing fingers extend radially, position the buffing fingers between grooves specially carved in the body and located on a central axis. Drawbacks of these devices include the fact that they do not use a fastening system to retain the buffing materials, and these devices typically do not have a retaining member attached to the body to keep the buffing fingers safely in the grooves during operation. The following patents disclose one or more of these features. U.S. Pat. No. 2,440,856 to Harrison discloses a finishing device in which a finishing element extends in two directions from a rotating central mandrel. U.S. Pat. No. 2,516,870 to Harrison discloses a finishing device wherein a flexible, plurality of material extends through a central mandrel so that it extends in two directions. U.S. Pat. No. 4,133,146 to De Cola discloses a rotary abrasive tool.",
        "The present invention overcomes the above-mentioned problems, as well as others, by providing an apparatus that includes a rotary, mechanical device that is easily assembled, and for which extending material (also referred to herein \u201cextending material elements\u201d), such as shop towels, may be quickly and easily replaced. The present invention provides a multi-purpose device to clean, buff, abrade, polish, compound, burnish, and perform similar functions by using a plurality of extending material, such as disposable shop towels, extending radially from a main body.",
        "One embodiment uses a two-portion body that provides an area for the extending material to be inserted and retained during use. The extending material, while retained, extends radially from the outer body, thereby allowing functions, such as cleaning, compounding, abrading, buffing, and polishing, of objects located peripherally to the main body. Moreover, the present invention allows the user to easily replace and/or dispose the extending material of the invention with readily available extending material, such as standard disposable shop towels, surgical towels, or paper towels. In one embodiment, the extending material is fixed to the mechanical device using friction, and therefore, in this embodiment, the extending materials do not require complex fastening features. Optionally retaining rings are used to further secure the extending material.",
        "In a second embodiment, the plurality of extending material, such as shop towels, are held in between two complementary portions that each include extensions and that are coupled to form the outer body. The device is connected along its central axis to a rotary machine, such as a drill, which provides the power for the rotating motion.",
        "Another feature of the present invention is that it provides a cost effective method for cleaning. The plurality of extending material, such as shop towels, are ready-made and readily available at commercial centers selling cleaning supplies. The present invention does not require specialized replacement parts, which are typically high in cost.",
        "The present invention also provides a cleaning device that may be assembled and disassembled quickly and simply. The extending material, such as the shop towels, may be efficiently replaced as the material becomes soiled, or at the discretion of the user. Removal of the towels only requires disengaging of the two components that comprise the outer body of the invention. Alternatively, the user may manually pull one end of a shop towel to unthread and remove the towel from the fully assembled device.",
        "Other features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, which disclose multiple embodiments of the present invention. It should be understood, however, that the drawings are designed for the purpose of illustration only and not as a definition of the limits of the invention. Additional advantages and novel features of the invention will also become more apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or upon learning by practice of the invention.",

        "This invention provides an apparatus for performing a number of functions, including buffing, cleaning, compounding, polishing, burnishing, and abrading, using rotary power supplied by a rotary machine. Extending members are inserted into the outer body of the invention and are retained using friction. When assembled, the plurality of extending members extend radially from the outer body of the invention. The user of the invention positions the invention such that the extending members come in contact with an intended surface. The extending members may be easily replaced and disposed of at the discretion of the user. There are numerous embodiments for this invention. The detailed description and drawings present two embodiments and several variations of these embodiments, but do not encompass all embodiments for this invention, additional variations of which will be apparent to those skilled in the art.",
        "Referring to the drawings, FIGS. 1A-1E show a first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIGS. 1A and 1C, the outer body of the invention is generally designated by the reference numeral 2 and the main body is generally designated by the reference numeral 10. The main body 10, which may be of any shape, such as cylindrical, spherical, or cubical, is comprised of a base 36 and a plurality of projection members 32, 34. The embodiment shown in FIG. 1A includes three projection members: two outside projection members 34 and one middle projection member 32. One end of the projection members can be formed with the base 36, or they can be fixed to the base 36 by any of a number of methods, including, for example, welding or chemical bonding. In one embodiment, the projection members 32, 34 extend in a general, first direction (\u201cA\u201d) from the first face 35 of the base 36. This embodiment also includes slots 12 between projection members 32, 34. The area and volume of each slot 12 may vary in various embodiments. In this embodiment, the slot 12 (also referred to herein as \u201capertures\u201d) is formed by the space between each outside projection member 34 and the middle projection member 32. As shown in FIG. 1B, this embodiment has two such slots 12.",
        "One end of the projection members 32, 34, also known as the distal end 14, receives a cap 16. As shown in 1E, the cap 16 is placed over or on top of the distal end 14 of the projection members 32, 34. The cap 16 is retained by any number of methods, such as via a retaining lip or via threads on the inner surface of the cap 16 that fit corresponding features on the distal end 14 of the projection members 32, 34. In one embodiment, each projection member 32, 34 tapers at the distal end 14, forming a narrowed end, which receives the cap 16. Tapering this feature, for example, may ease assembly and disassembly.",
        "A rotation rod 38 extends from the second face 37 of the base to a rotary machine 4, such as a handheld drill. The rotation rod 38 may be formed or affixed to the main body 10 in a similar manner as the projection members 32, 34.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, the rotation rod 38 can be disassembled and removed from the main body 10, as further shown in FIG. 1E. In this embodiment, the main body 10 has a central cavity 22, which extends from the second face 37 of the base 36 to the first face 35 of the base 36, and continues to extend through the middle projection member 32. The rotation rod 38 has T-shape or any similar shape allowing the rotation rod 38 to be retained within the central cavity 22 as described further below. In one embodiment, the rotation rod 38 is comprised of two sub-parts: 1) a central rod 23 is perpendicularly formed or affixed to 2) a central anchor 24. The rotation rod 38 and main body 10 are assembled such that the central rod 23 of the rotation rod 38 is inserted in the central cavity 22 from the first face of the base through the middle projection member 32. The rotation rod 38 is positioned by pulling the central rod 23 to the second face 37 of the base 36 until the central anchor 24 rests against the first face 35 of the base 36. As shown in 1E, in one embodiment, the second face 37 of the base 36 has a receiving area 33 to fixedly position the central anchor 24. The central anchor 24 and corresponding receiving area 33 on the base 36 may be arbitrarily held by any number of retaining features, such as adhesives or a retainer nut that abuts the second face 37 of the base 36. In one embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIGS. 1D and 1E, a retainer nut 26 is positioned against the second face 37 of the base 36 and is secured to the rotation rod 38 using, for example, thread features on the inner surface of the retainer nut and the exterior of the rotation rod 38.",
        "A plurality of extending material 20, such as shop towels, paper towels, or surgical towels, are inserted through the slots 12. In one embodiment of the present invention, the extending material 20 is manipulated to fit through the slots 12, such as by rolling, folding, or similar compacting methods. In one embodiment of the invention, two pieces of extending material 20, which form a first tier, are inserted in the slots 12, such that the surface of each extending material 20 is positioned flush against the first face 35 of the base 36 and in between two projection members 32, 34. The extending materials 20 are positioned so as to extend beyond both sides of the slot 12. FIG. 1D illustrates an overhead view of one relationship between the extending material 20 and the main body 10 while the present invention is in use. Additional extending material 20 may be positioned on top of the first tier until the slots 12 are filled.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1D, in one variation of the invention, a holder ring 18, which, for example, is of a complementary shape as the main body 10 having, for example, an inner diameter slightly larger than the main body 10, is slidably placed over the outer circumference of the main body 10, such that it encompasses one or more of the projection members 32, 34 so as to secure the first tier of extending material 20. In one embodiment of the present invention, successive tiers of extending material 20 are then inserted in the slots 12 of the main body 10, with additional holder rings 18 positioned in between each tier of extending material 20.",
        "Upon completion of the extending material insertion, the last tier of extending material 20 rests just below the distal end 14 of projection members 32, 34. The cap 16 is placed over the projection members 32, 34 so as to secure the extending members 20 to the main body 10.",
        "In one embodiment of the invention, a rotary machine 4, such as a drill, for example, is then optionally attached to the rotation rod 38 so as to provide a power source for the main body 10 of the invention to rotate the outer body 2 around its central axis (\u201cB\u201d).",
        "A second embodiment of the current invention is shown in FIGS. 2A-2E. This embodiment of the present invention is comprised of two portions, a tool base 52 and a tool end 62, which are coupled together to form an outer body 68. As illustrated in FIG. 2A, the tool base 52 is comprised of a first disc 56, which may be of any of a variety of cross-sectional shapes, and a plurality of base rods 50 extending from a first face 55 of the first disc 56. A variation of the invention may have a rotation rod 54 extending from the second face 57 of the first disc 56. The base rods 50 and rotation rod 54 are formed or affixed into position on the first disc 56 by any number of methods, such as welding, chemical bonding, or other securing and retaining features.",
        "As further shown in FIG. 2C, interposed between the base rods 50 on the first face 55 of the first disc 56 are base openings 51, such as through holes, which are of any cross-sectional shape, so as to be complementary to the shape of the end rods 60. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2C, the first disc 56 includes two base openings 51. The base openings 51 and plurality of base rods 50 are positioned in any manner, such as a symmetrical path, which may be in a circular pattern, as shown in FIGS. 2C and 2D, about the first disc 56. In one embodiment, the positions of the base openings 51 and plurality of base rods 50 on the first disc 56 are complementary to the position of the plurality of end rods 60 and end openings 61, respectively, on the second disc 66.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 2B, the tool end 62 is comprised of a plurality of end rods 60 extending from the first face 67 to the second face 65 of the second disc 66, which may be of any variety of cross-sectional shapes. The end rods 60 are formed or affixed to the second disc 66 using, for example, any of the methods to form or affix the base rods 50 to the first disc 56. In one embodiment, the first face 67 of the second disc 66 also has a plurality of end openings 61, such as through holes, interposed with the end rods 60. As illustrated in FIG. 2D, in this embodiment, the second disc 66 has two end openings 61, which are of any cross-sectional shape but are greater in diameter than the base rods 50. In one embodiment, the end openings 61 are positioned in between the end rods 60 in any path, including symmetrical paths, such as in a circular pattern, about the second disc 62. In one embodiment, the positions of the end openings 61 and end rods 60 are complementary to the position of base rods 50 and base openings 51 on the first disc 56. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 2A-2E, the outer body 68 is assembled by engaging the tool base 52 and the tool end 62. The plurality of base rods 50 extend towards the tool end 62, and the plurality of end rods 60 extend towards the tool base 52. The tool end 62 and tool base 52 are arranged such that each base rod 50 and each base opening 51 align with the corresponding end opening 61 and a end rod 62, respectively. Hence, each base rod 52 has a complementary end opening 61, and each end rod 62 has a complementary base opening 51.",
        "In one embodiment of the present invention, a retaining member 64, such as a retaining pin, retaining lock, adhesive, or other retaining feature or features, are located at the distal end 59 of the plurality of end rods 60. As shown in FIG. 2B, at least one end rod 60 contains a retainer member 64. In one variation of this invention, the end rods 60 are slightly longer than the base rods 50, and thus, when the invention is assembled, the end rods 60 extend through the base openings 51 to the second face 57 of the first disc 56. The retaining member 64 on the end rods 60 prevents the tool base 52 and tool end 62 from disengaging.",
        "In one embodiment, when the tool end 62 and tool base 52 are engaged, the outer body 68, between the first disc 56 and second disc 66, contains a plurality of slots 70 interposed between the base rods 52 and the end rods 62.",

In one embodiment, the extending material element is manipulated, by folding, rolling, or otherwise compacting, to fit through the slots 70. Extending material elements 20 are stacked or placed side-by-side, until the slot 70 is filled. The amount of extending material 20 depends upon the amount of extending material 20 that is necessary to fill the slots 70. The extending material 20 is retained in the slots 70 by friction from, for example, the sides of the slots 70 and/or the compressing force of the disks 56, 66 produced upon assembly.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 2E, in one embodiment, the invention is fully assembled when the outer body 68 is formed by engaging the tool end 62 with the tool base 52, and the plurality of extending members 20, such as shop towels 20, extends radially from the central axis of the outer body 68. In one embodiment, to replace or dispose of the extending 20 material, the retainer member 64 is unlocked and the tool end 62 is disengaged. Alternatively, the extending material 20 may simply be pulled out of the outer body 68 without disassembling the outer body 68.",
        "In one embodiment, a rotation rod 54 extends from the second face 57 of the first disc 56 and connects to a rotary machine 4, such as a drill. Such a rotation rod 54 may be formed or assembled with this embodiment similar to that described with regard to the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1A-1E. This embodiment of the invention may be used with handheld machinery as well as larger machinery.",
        "Example embodiments of the present invention have now been described in accordance with the above advantages. It will be appreciated that these examples are merely illustrative of the invention. Many variations and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art."
