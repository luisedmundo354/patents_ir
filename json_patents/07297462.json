    "description": [
        "This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/526,321 filed Dec. 02, 2003 and EP Patent Application No. 03104238.5 filed on Nov. 17, 2003 which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.",
        "The present invention relates to a heat-sensitive lithographic printing plate precursor.",
        "Lithographic printing typically involves the use of a so-called printing master such as a printing plate which is mounted on a cylinder of a rotary printing press. The master carries a lithographic image on its surface and a print is obtained by applying ink to said image and then transferring the ink from the master onto a receiver material, which is typically paper. In conventional lithographic printing, ink as well as an aqueous fountain solution (also called dampening liquid) are supplied to the lithographic image which consists of oleophilic (or hydrophobic, i.e. ink-accepting, water-repelling) areas as well as hydrophilic (or oleophobic, i.e. water-accepting, ink-repelling) areas. In so-called driographic printing, the lithographic image consists of ink-accepting and ink-abhesive (ink-repelling) areas and during driographic printing, only ink is supplied to the master.",
        "Printing masters are generally obtained by the so-called computer-to-film method wherein various pre-press steps such as typeface selection, scanning, color separation, screening, trapping, layout and imposition are accomplished digitally and each color selection is transferred to graphic arts film using an image-setter. After processing, the film can be used as a mask for the exposure of an imaging material called plate precursor and after plate processing, a printing plate is obtained which can be used as a master.",
        "A typical photosensitive printing plate precursor for computer-to-film methods comprises a hydrophilic support and an image-recording layer which includes UV-sensitive compositions. Upon image-wise exposure of a negative-working plate, typically by means of a film mask in a UV contact frame, the exposed image areas become insoluble and the unexposed areas remain soluble in an aqueous alkaline developer. The plate is then processed with the developer to remove the diazonium salt or diazo resin in the unexposed areas. So the exposed areas define the image areas (printing areas) of the printing master, and such printing plate precursors are therefore called \u2018negative-working\u2019. Also positive-working materials, wherein the exposed areas define the non-printing areas, are known, e.g. plates having a novolac/naphtoquinone-diazide coating which dissolves in the developer only at exposed areas.",
        "In addition to the above- photosensitive materials, also heat-sensitive printing plate precursors have become very popular. Such thermal materials offer the advantage of daylight-stability and are especially used in the so-called computer-to-plate method wherein the plate precursor is directly exposed, i.e. without the use of a film mask. The material is exposed to heat or to infrared light and the generated heat triggers a (physico-)chemical process, such as ablation, polymerization, insolubilization by cross-linking of a polymer or by particle coagulation of a thermoplastic polymer latex, and solubilization by the destruction of intermolecular interactions.",
        "Thermal plates which require no processing are also known; such plates are typically of the so-called ablative type, i.e. the differentiation between hydrophilic and oleophilic areas is produced by heat-induced ablation of one or more layers of the coating, so that at exposed areas a surface is revealed which has a different affinity towards ink or fountain than the surface of the unexposed coating. A major problem associated with ablative plates, however, is the generation of ablation debris which may contaminate the electronics and optics of the exposure device and which needs to be removed from the plate by wiping it with a cleaning solvent, so that ablative plates are often not truly processless. Ablation debris which is deposited onto the plate's surface may also interfere during the printing process.",
        "Other thermal plates that require no processing are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,855,173, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,839,369 and 5,839,370 where a method relying on the image-wise hydrophilic-hydrophobic transition of a ceramic such as a zirconia ceramic and the subsequent reverse transition in an image erasure step. This image-wise transition is obtained by exposure to infrared laser irradiation at a wavelength of 1064 nm at high power (the average power is 1 W to 50 W and the peak power lies between 6 kW and 100 kW) which induces local ablation and formation of substoichiometric zirconia. U.S. Pat. No. 5,893,328, U.S. Pat. No. 5,836,248 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,836,249 disclose a printing material comprising a composite of zirconia alloy and \u03b1-alumina which can be imaged using similar exposure means to cause localized \u201cmelting\u201d of the alloy in the exposed areas and thereby creating hydrophobic/oleophilic surfaces. A similar printing material containing an alloy of zirconium oxide and Yttrium oxide is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,870,956. The high laser power output required in these prior art methods implies the use of expensive exposure devices.",
        "Another type of processless plates are printing plates based on a so-called \u201cswitching\u201d reaction where a hydrophilic surface is irreversibly changed into an oleophilic surface or vice versa by imagewise exposure. EP 652 483 for example, describes a positive working printing plate based on an acid catalyzed cleavage of acid-labile groups pendant from a polymer backbone. EP 200 488 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,081,572 describe negative working plates where a hydrophilic/hydrophobic conversion is obtained by a chemical reaction upon imagewise exposure to heat. Other examples of processless plates are based on the thermally induced rupture of microcapsules and the subsequent reaction of the microencapsulated oleophilic materials (isocyanates) with functional (hydroxyl-)groups on cross-linked hydrophilic binders (U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,573; EP 646 476; WO94/2395; WO98/29258).",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 6,582,882 describes an imaging element comprising a graft copolymer having a hydrophobic backbone and a plurality of pendant hydrophilic groups or a plurality of pendant groups comprising hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments. Upon exposure of the imaging element to thermal energy, the exposed areas become less soluble in a developer than the unexposed areas.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 6,362,274 describes grafted copolymers comprising three sequences: one sequence for anchoring on solid particles such as pigments and fillers, one hydrophobic sequence and one hydrophilic sequence for using the copolymers in aqueous and/or organic medium. The disclosed copolymers are of particular interest in a wide range of paint formulations; there is no reference in the cited prior art document to lithographic printing plates.",

The same was observed when exposing the copolymer of the heat-sensitive lithographic printing plate of the present invention to heat. This conversion reaction is illustrated by an increase of the contact angle against water.

For example, the aluminum oxide surface may be silicated by treating its surface with a sodium silicate solution at elevated temperature, e.g. 95\u00b0 C. Alternatively, a phosphate treatment may be applied which involves treating the aluminum oxide surface with a phosphate solution that may further contain an inorganic fluoride. Further, the aluminum oxide surface may be rinsed with an organic acid and/or salt thereof, e.g. carboxylic acids, hydrocarboxylic acids, sulphonic acids or phosphonic acids, or their salts, e.g. succinates, phosphates, phosphonates, sulphates, and sulphonates. A citric acid or citrate solution is preferred. This treatment may be carried out at room temperature or may be carried out at a slightly elevated temperature of about 30 to 50\u00b0 C.

        "Optionally, the coating may further contain additional ingredients. Preferred ingredients are e.g. additional binders, especially sulfonamide and phthalimide groups containing polymers, to improve the run length and chemical resistance of the plate. Examples of such polymers are those described in EP 933682, EP 894622 and WO 99/63407. Also colorants can be added such as dyes or pigments which provide a visible colour to the coating and which remain in the coating at unexposed areas so that a visible image is produced after exposure and processing. Typical examples of such contrast dyes are the amino-substituted tri- or diarylmethane dyes, e.g. crystal violet, methyl violet, victoria pure blue, flexoblau 630, basonylblau 640, auramine and malachite green. Polymers particles such as matting agents and spacers are also well-known components of lithographic coatings which can be used in the plate precursor of the present invention.",

For example, the above ingredients can be dissolved in a solvent mixture which does not react irreversibly with the ingredients and which is preferably tailored to the intended coating method, the layer thickness, the composition of the layer and the drying conditions. Suitable solvents include ketones, such as methyl ethyl ketone (butanone), as well as chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as trichloroethylene or l,l,l-trichloroethane, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol or propanol, ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, glycol-monoalkyl ethers, such as ethylene glycol monoalkyl ether, e.g. 2-methoxy-1-propanol, or propylene glycol monoalkyl ether and esters, such as butyl acetate or propylene glycol monoalkyl ether acetate. It is also possible to use a mixture which, for special purposes, may additionally contain solvents such as acetonitrile, dioxane, dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide or water.",
        "Any coating method can be used for applying one or more coating solutions to the hydrophilic surface of the support. A multi-layer coating can be applied by coating/drying each layer consecutively or by the simultaneous coating of several coating solutions at once. In the drying step, the volatile solvents are removed from the coating until the coating is self-supporting and dry to the touch. However it is not necessary (and may not even be possible) to remove all the solvent in the drying step. Indeed the residual solvent content may be regarded as an additional composition variable by means of which the composition may be optimised. Drying is typically carried out by blowing hot air onto the coating, typically at a temperature of at least 70\u00b0 C., suitably 80-150\u00b0 C. and especially 90-140\u00b0 C. Also infrared lamps can be used. The drying time may typically be 15-600 seconds.",

The infrared light is preferably converted into heat by an IR light absorbing compound as discussed above. The heat-sensitive lithographic printing plate precursor of the present invention is preferably not sensitive to visible light. Most preferably, the coating is not sensitive to ambient daylight, i.e. visible (400-750 nm) and near UV light (300-400 nm) at an intensity and exposure time corresponding to normal working conditions so that the material can be handled without the need for a safe light environment.",
        "The printing plate precursor of the present invention can be exposed to infrared light by means of e.g. LEDs or a laser. Most preferably, the light used for the exposure is a laser emitting near infrared light having a wavelength in the range from about 750 to about 1500 nm, such as a semiconductor laser diode, a Nd:YAG or a Nd:YLF laser. The required laser power depends on the sensitivity of the image-recording layer, the pixel dwell time of the laser beam, which is determined by the spot diameter (typical value of modern plate-setters at 1/e2 of maximum intensity: 10-25 \u03bcm), the scan speed and the resolution of the exposure apparatus (i.e. the number of addressable pixels per unit of linear distance, often expressed in dots per inch or dpi; typical value: 1000-4000 dpi).",
        "Two types of laser-exposure apparatuses are commonly used: internal (ITD) and external drum (XTD) plate-setters. ITD plate-setters for thermal plates are typically characterized by a very high scan speed up to 1500 m/sec and may require a laser power of several Watts. The Agfa Galileo T (trademark of Agfa Gevaert N.V.) is a typical example of a plate-setter using the ITD-technology. XTD plate-setters for thermal plates having a typical laser power from about 20 mW to about 500 mW operate at a lower scan speed, e.g. from 0.1 to 20 m/sec. The Creo Trendsetter plate-setter family (trademark of Creo) and the Agfa Excalibur plate-setter family (trademark of Agfa Gevaert N.V.) both make use of the XTD-technology.",

XTD plate-setter configurations can also be used for on-press exposure, offering the benefit of immediate registration in a multi-color press. More technical details of on-press exposure apparatuses are described in e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5,174,205 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,163,368.",
        "The plate precursor according to the invention can, if required, then be post-treated with a suitable correcting agent or preservative as known in the art. To increase the resistance of the finished printing plate and hence to extend the print run, the layer can be briefly heated to elevated temperatures (\u201cbaking\u201d). As a result, the resistance of the printing plate to washout agents, correction agents and UW-curable printing inks also increases. Such a thermal post-treatment is described, inter alia, in DE-A 14 47 963 and GB-A 1 154 749.",

        "The grafting reaction of Jeffamine M-1000 on poly[PDMS-MA-co-MSA] is a two step process, involving (i) the nucleophilic addition of the amine group to a carbonyl unit of the MSA rings to form an amic acid intermediate, and (ii) the formation of an cyclic imide with water expellation. Since both the steps require different reaction conditions the amic acid can be isolated and investigated. It turned out that the amic acid form was not stable against crosslinking in bulk and at ambient conditions, hence it had to be converted to the imide form (FIG. 1 gives a schematically representation of the reaction).",

Subsequently, triethylamine (=TEA) and acetic anhydride (=AC2O) were added to the mixture and heated for 24 hours at 90\u00b0 C. After this time the reaction was ended and the solvent was removed by evaporation. The polymer was re-dissolved in 15 ml of toluene and transferred in a separation funnel. 20 ml of distilled water was added and, after shaking, the light phase was separated. The organic layer was washed twice with 20 ml of distilled water. The solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator and the graft polymer was dried under vacuum at room temperature for 24 hours. The polymer was isolated as a waxy-brown material. The graft copolymers were analysed by Size Exclusion Chromatography to confirm that the non-reacted Jeffamine was removed.",
