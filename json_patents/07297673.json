        "This invention relates to an aqueous system having a high pH and a rheology-modifying polymer.",
        "Rheology modifiers are used in aqueous cleaning products, including for example, shampoo, to increase viscosity at low shear rates while maintaining flow properties of the product at higher shear rates. In addition, rheology modifiers can provide effective, heat-age stable suspensions of particulate material or beads dispersed in the aqueous phase. A variety of copolymer thickeners made from vinyl monomers have been used for this purpose. For example, U.S. Application Pub. No. 2004/0063855, discloses an acrylic emulsion polymer of methacrylic acid, an alkyl acrylate, acrylic acid and stearyloxypoly(ethyleneoxy)20ethyl methacrylate. However, such thickeners are intended for use in consumer products having near-neutral pH values. In contrast, industrial cleaning compositions and some personal care products can have pH values of at least 10.",
        "The problem addressed by the present invention is the need for a rheology-modifying polymer having good stability and favorable rheological properties at high pH.",

        "Percentages are weight percentages based on the entire composition, unless specified otherwise. As used herein the term \u201c(meth)acrylic\u201d refers to acrylic or methacrylic, and \u201c(meth)acrylate\u201d refers to acrylate or methacrylate. The term \u201cacrylic polymers\u201d refers to polymers of acrylic monomers, i.e., acrylic acid (AA), methacrylic acid (MAA) and their esters, and copolymers comprising at least 50% of acrylic monomers. Esters of AA and MAA include, but are not limited to, methyl methacrylate (MMA), ethyl methacrylate (EMA), butyl methacrylate (BMA), hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), methyl acrylate (MA), ethyl acrylate (EA), butyl acrylate (BA), ethylhexyl acrylate (EHA), and hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), as well as other alkyl esters of AA or MAA, including the lipophilically modified monomers described below. Preferably, acrylic polymers have at least 75% of monomer residues derived from (meth)acrylic acid or (meth)acrylate monomers, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, and most preferably at least 98%.

According to one embodiment, such groups are suitably in the same copolymer component as and attached to hydrophilic chains, such as for example polyoxyethylene chains. According to another embodiment, the copolymer may contain a vinyl group which may be used to copolymerize the polymer to other vinyl-containing entities to alter or improve the properties of the polymer. Alternatively other copolymerization systems may be used. The polymerizable group may be attached to the lipophilic group directly, or indirectly for example via one or more, for example up to 60, preferably up to 40, water-soluble linker groups, for example, \u2014CH[R]CH2O\u2014 or \u2014CH[R]CH2NH\u2014 groups wherein R is hydrogen or methyl. Alternatively, the polymerizable group may be attached to the lipophilic group by reaction of the hydrophilic, for example polyoxyethylene, component with a urethane compound containing unsaturation. The molecular weight of the lipophilic-modifying group or groups is preferably selected together with the number of such groups to give the required minimum lipophilic content in the copolymer, and preferably, for satisfactory performance in a wide range of systems.",

It is understood that the alkyl groups may be either of synthetic or of natural origin and, in the latter case particularly, may contain a range of chain lengths. For example, naturally sourced stearic acid, even of commercially pure quality may contain only about 90% of stearic chains, up to about 7% of palmitic chains and a proportion of other chains and lower quality products may contain substantially less stearic acid. It is intended herein that reference to the chain length of such groups is to the predominant chain length which is present as more than 50%, preferably in more than 75%, of the chains.",

Cationic surfactants characterized by amine or ammonium solubilizing groups, and/or amphoteric surfactants characterized by combinations of the anionic and cationic solubilizing groups may be selected.

        "The data in the Tables above demonstrate that Polymers 2-5 and 7-8, which are within the scope of the present invention, provide pH-stable high viscosities at low shear rates, and low viscosities at high shear rates. In contrast, Polymer 1, which has ester functionality in its crosslinker residues, and Polymer 6, which has amide functionality in its crosslinker residues, do not provide high viscosity at low shear rate after aging in a high-pH formulation."
