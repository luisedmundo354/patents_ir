        "In many backlight display devices, for example in liquid crystal display televisions (LCD TV), there is a demand for larger and larger displays. As the size of a display increases, the number of light sources (e.g., a cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL)) used to backlight the display can also increase. Accordingly, the backlight display system can desirably comprise a light-diffusing film (also referred to as a light-diffusing sheet, a plate, and the like). Examples of the utility of the light-diffusing film includes, but is not limited to, hiding the light and dark pattern that can be created by an array of CCFLs, hiding injection molded patterns or printing on a light guide of the display device, providing uniformity in illumination, and the like.",

For example, the brightness enhancement film can include those structures and materials discussed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 2003/0108710 to Coyle et al. Advantageously, it has been discovered that the light-diffusing film 110 can comprise superior luminance and hiding power compared to present commercially available light-diffusing films.

        "While the thickness of the light-diffusing film can vary depending on the desired application. For LCD TV applications, it has been discovered that the desired hiding power and luminance can be obtained when the light-diffusing film has a thickness of about 1.0 millimeters to about 4.0 millimeters, particularly about 1.4 millimeters to about 3 millimeters, and even more particularly a thickness of about 1.8 millimeters to about 2.2 millimeters.",
        "In various embodiments, the light-diffusing film can have a polished surface, a textured surface, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. More particularly, the light-diffusing film can comprise any surface texture that can provide the desired ease in handling and provides the desired cosmetic effect. For example, the light-diffusing film can have a surface roughness (Ra) of about 0.01 micrometer to about 2 micrometers, particularly a surface roughness of about 0.25 micrometers to about 0.65 micrometers, wherein surface roughness values are measured in accordance with Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS B0601) as measured using a Kosaka ET4000 Surface profilometer. Surface roughness (Ra) is a term readily understood by those skilled in the art. Generally, the Ra is a measure of the average roughness of the film. It can be determined by integrating the absolute value of the difference between the surface height and the average height and dividing by the measurement length for a one dimensional surface profile, or the measurement area for a two dimensional surface profile.",
        "As briefly mentioned above, the light-diffusing film can be a solid unitary film characterized by the absence of multiple layers. Advantageously, by making a film that is a unitary structure that does not comprise multiple layers, the overall cost of the light-diffusing film can be reduced compared to a film that comprises multiple layers. Additionally, in various embodiments, the light-diffusing film can be a solid sheet, which again can reduce the cost of manufacturing compared to a film including multiple layers. Further, a solid sheet light-diffusing film can eliminate problems including delamination, lack of adhesion between coextruded layers, coating cracking, and the like that are associated with multiple layer structures.",
        "It has also been discovered that extruded films made using polycarbonate powder can aid in imparting the desired properties to the light-diffusing film. For example, in making the light-diffusing film, the polycarbonate powder, the light-diffusing particles, and any other additives that may be desired for one particular application, can be mixed and disposed in a hopper of an extruder.",
        "Further, in various embodiments, the light-diffusing film does not comprise any dyes or colorants to obtain a neutral or white color. It has been discovered that dyes and/or colorants can adversely affect luminance (e.g., up to a 10% drop in luminance can be observed when using a color additive). Rather, a white color can be generated by the light-diffusing particles and the yellowness index of the polycarbonate.",
        "In the following examples, light-diffusing films were produced by the following process (Table 1) Masterbatch resin was pre-dried at 250\u00b0 F. (degrees Fahrenheit) (about 121\u00b0 C. (degrees Celsius)) overnight.",

        "The masterbatch resin (See Table 3) was loaded into a hopper (hopper C for convenience in discussion) and PC powder into another hopper (hopper A for convenience in discussion). The flow rate of masterbatch resin was controlled to around 10% of the total flow rate. The transmission value of the diffuser sheet was measured against the specifications during the run. The transmission value of the sheet was adjusted in situ by varying the ratio of masterbatch loading to PC powder loading as necessary.",
        "The resulting light-diffusing films were cut into 2.05 meter\u00d71.25 meter samples having a thickness of 2 millimeters. The light-diffusing particles employed in making the light-diffusing films were a polymethyl silsesquioxane obtained from General Electric (GE) Silicones under the trade name Tospearl. The refractive index of the Tospearl was reported to be 1.42. The average particle size and concentration of the polymethyl silsesquioxane were varied.",
        "In Table 2, the average particle size and concentration of the polymethyl silsesquioxane was varied and the luminance gain and hiding power for each light-diffusing film composition was compared relative to a commercially available light-diffusing film (PC1311-50 available from Teijin Chemical Ltd. of Japan). PC1311-50 was a polycarbonate film comprising about 3.5 wt. % acrylate particles, wherein the weight percents were based on a total weight of the film. The PC1311-50 film had a thickness of about 2 millimeters and a transmission of 50.4%. The luminance gain relative to PC1311-50 was measured using the 13 points test described above (measured using a Topcon BM-7 instrument), while the hiding power was calculated as described above. The backlight module film stack configuration used in these measurements comprised a polycarbonate light-diffusing film at the bottom and 2 bottom diffusers (coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films with 0.127 mm thickness each, sold as D121 films by Tsujiden Co., Ltd.) as the top layer. No brightness enhancement films (BEF) or dual brightness enhancement films (DBEF) were employed in this measurement configuration. It was noted that the optimum performance for luminance and hiding power (as measured and discussed above) for this set of data was obtained by particles with an average size of 2 micrometers at 0.5 wt. % in polycarbonate as shown in Example 6 in Table 2.",

It was noted that the YI less than 1.0 provides the best results for that set of data. (Example 17). More particularly, a yellowness index of 0.99 provided a luminance gain of 103.4% and a hiding power of 0.36 when compared to PC1311-50. Further, this data showed that at a yellowness index of 1.3, the film actually had a luminance less than PC1311-50. More particularly, for Example 16, the luminance was 98.5% when compared to Pci 311-50. A luminance gain of greater than or equal to 102% was obtained with YI of about 0.9 to 1.10.",

Without being bound by theory, it was determined that at a hiding power greater than 0.5 light and dark patterns may start to be observed. Example 24 had the best combination of luminance (102.2) and hiding power (0.4). As mentioned above, any luminance gain while increasing hiding power can provide a significant commercial advantage to the light-diffusing film.",

Further, it is noted that the light-diffusing film disclosed herein can be a solid unitary film characterized by the absence of multiple layers, which can advantageously reduce the overall cost and improved reliability of the light-diffusing film compared to multi-layer films that are formed by lamination, coating or co-extrusion.",
