        "This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 10/323,263 filed on Dec. 19, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,640 which claims the benefit of provisional application Ser. No. 60/342,838, filed on Dec. 20, 2001, the entire disclosure of each application is hereby incorporated by reference.",
        "Various central nervous system disorders such as anxiety, depression, motor disorders, etc., are believed to involve a disturbance of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin. Serotonin is localized in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is known to affect many types of conditions including psychiatric disorders, motor activity, feeding behavior, sexual activity, and neuroendocrine regulation among others. The effects of serotonin are regulated by the various 5-HT receptor subtypes. Known 5-HT receptors include the 5-HT1 family (e.g. 5-HT1A), the 5-HT2 family (e.g. 5-HT2A), 5-HT3,5-HT4,5-HT5,5-HT6 and 5-HT7 subtypes.",
        "The recently identified human 5-hydroxytryptamine-6 (5-HT6) receptor subtype has been cloned, and the extensive distribution of its mRNA has been reported. Highest levels of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA have been observed in the olfactory tubercle, the striatum, nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus and CA1, CA2 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Lower levels of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA are seen in the granular layer of the cerebellum, several diencephalic nuclei, amygdala and in the cortex. Northern blots have revealed that 5-HT6 receptor mRNA appears to be exclusively present in the brain, with little evidence for its presence in peripheral tissues. The high affinity of a number of antipsychotic agents for the 5-HT6 receptor, in addition to its mRNA localization in striatum, olfactory tubercle and nucleus accumbens suggests that some of the clinical actions of these compounds may be mediated through this receptor. Therefore, 5-HT6 receptor ligands are believed to be of potential use in the treatment of certain CNS disorders such as anxiety, depression, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorder, attention deficit disorder, migraine, cognitive memory enhancement (e.g. for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease), sleep disorders, feeding disorders (e.g. anorexia or bulimia), neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. stroke or head trauma), panic attacks, withdrawal from drug abuse (e.g. cocaine, ethanol, nicotine or benzodiazepines), schizophrenia, or the like; or in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome.",
        "Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide compounds which are useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of a variety of central nervous system disorders related to or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor.",
        "It is another object of this invention to provide therapeutic methods and pharmaceutical compositions useful for the treatment of central nervous system disorders related to or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor.",
        "It is a feature of this invention that the compounds provided may also be used to further study and elucidate the 5-HT6 receptor.",
        "These and other objects and features of the invention will become more apparent by the detailed description set forth hereinbelow.",

        "The 5-hydroxytryptamine-6 (5-HT6) receptor is one of the most recent receptors to be identified by molecular cloning. Its ability to bind a wide range of therapeutic compounds used in psychiatry, coupled with its intriguing distribution in the brain has stimulated significant interest in new compounds which are capable of interacting with or affecting said receptor. Significant efforts are being made to understand the possible role of the 5-HT6 receptor in psychiatry, cognitive dysfunction, motor function and control, memory, mood and the like. To that end, compounds which demonstrate a binding affinity for the 5-HT6 receptor are earnestly sought both as an aid in the study of the 5-HT6 receptor and as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of central nervous system disorders, for example see C. Reavill and D. C. Rogers, Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2001, 2(1):104-109, Pharma Press Ltd.",
        "Surprisingly, it has now been found that azaindolylalkylamine derivatives of formula I demonstrate 5-HT6 affinity. Advantageously, said amine derivatives may be used as effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders associated with or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor. Accordingly, the present invention provides azaindolylalkylamine derivatives of formula I",

        "Comparative Evaluation of 5-HT6 Binding Affinity of Test Compounds",
        "The affinity of test compounds for the serotonin 5-HT6 receptor is evaluated in the following manner. Cultured Hela cells expressing human cloned 5-HT6 receptors are harvested and centrifuged at low speed (1,000\u00d7g) for 10.0 min to remove the culture media. The harvested cells are suspended in half volume of fresh physiological phosphate buffered saline solution and recentrifuged at the same speed. This operation is repeated. The collected cells are then homogenized in ten volumes of 50 mM Tris.HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.5 mM EDTA. The homogenate is centrifuged at 40,000\u00d7g for 30.0 min and the precipitate is collected. The obtained pellet is resuspended in 10 volumes of Tris.HCl buffer and recentrifuged at the same speed. The final pellet is suspended in a small volume of Tris.HCl buffer and the tissue protein content is determined in aliquots of 10-25 \u03bcl volumes. Bovine Serum Albumin is used as the standard in the protein determination according to the method described in Lowry et al., J. Biol. Chem., 193:265 (1951). The volume of the suspended cell membranes is adjusted to give a tissue protein concentration of 1.0 mg/ml of suspension. The prepared membrane suspension (10 times concentrated) is aliquoted in 1.0 ml volumes and stored at \u221270\u00b0 C. until used in subsequent binding experiments.",
        "Binding experiments are performed in a 96 well microtiter plate format, in a total volume of 200 \u03bcl. To each well is added the following mixture: 80.0 \u03bcl of incubation buffer made in 50 mM Tris.HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10.0 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM EDTA and 20 \u03bcl of [3H]-LSD (S.A., 86.0 Ci/mmol, available from Amersham Life Science), 3.0 nM. The dissociation constant, KD of the [3H]LSD at the human serotonin 5-HT6 receptor is 2.9 nM, as determined by saturation binding with increasing concentrations of [3H]LSD. The reaction is initiated by the final addition of 100.0 \u03bcl of tissue suspension. Nonspecific binding is measured in the presence of 10.0 \u03bcM methiothepin. The test compounds are added in 20.0 \u03bcl volume.",
        "The reaction is allowed to proceed in the dark for 120 min at room temperature, at which time, the bound ligand-receptor complex is filtered off on a 96 well unifilter with a Packard Filtermate\u00ae 196 Harvester. The bound complex caught on the filter disk is allowed to air dry and the radioactivity is measured in a Packard TopCount\u00ae equipped with six photomultiplier detectors, after the addition of 40.0 \u03bcl Microscint\u00ae-20 scintillant to each shallow well. The unifilter plate is heat-sealed and counted in a PackardTopCount\u00ae with a tritium efficiency of 31.0%.",
        "Specific binding to the 5-HT6 receptor is defined as the total radioactivity bound less the amount bound in the presence of 10.0 \u03bcM unlabeled methiothepin. Binding in the presence of varying concentrations of test compound is expressed as a percentage of specific binding in the absence of test compound. The results are plotted as log % bound versus log concentration of test compound. Nonlinear regression analysis of data points with a computer assisted program Prism\u00ae yielded both the IC50 and the Ki values of test compounds with 95% confidence limits. A linear regression line of data points is plotted, from which the IC50 value is determined and the Ki value is determined based upon the following equation:\n\nKi=IC50/(1+L/KD)\n\nwhere L is the concentration of the radioactive ligand used and KD is the dissociation constant of the ligand for the receptor, both expressed in nM.",
        "Using this assay, the following Ki values are determined and compared to those values obtained by representative compounds known to demonstrate binding to the 5-HT6 receptor. The data are shown in Table V, below.",
