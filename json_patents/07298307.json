The digital filter 5 is implemented as a moving average filter.",

The integrator 1 is given the value resulting from subtracting the output value (+\u0394 or \u2212\u0394) of the D/A converter 3 in the immediately preceding period from the analog input signal value. Thus, the operation of quantizing the integration value of the difference between the analog input signal value and the output value of the quantizer 2 in the immediately preceding period by one bit is repeated in the given period. Accordingly, the analog input signal value is converted into a one-bit coding string for output from the quantizer 2. Such a \u03a3\u0394 modulation technology is known and therefore will not be discussed here in detail.",

Therefore, the noise immunity can be improved markedly.",
        "In the first embodiment, the measures against noise derived from the 50 Hz commercial frequency are illustrated.

The dips of the gain exist in an integral multiple of 50 Hz and in an integral multiple of 60 Hz.",
        "As such gain properties provided, the removal ratio of the signals of 50 Hz and 60 Hz of the commercial frequencies and the signals whose frequencies are an integral multiple of 50 Hz and an integral multiple of 60 Hz can be raised. Therefore, the \u03a3\u0394 analog-to-digital converter of the second embodiment makes it possible to markedly improve immunity from the noise derived from the commercial frequency regardless of whether the \u03a3\u0394 analog-to-digital converter is used in the 50 Hz commercial power region or in the 60 Hz commercial power region. In the example shown in FIG. 3, the gain of the digital filter 5 at high frequencies lessens, so that the \u03a3\u0394 analog-to-digital converter of the second embodiment is suited for handling analog signals in the low-frequency region where the gain is high.",
        "The digital filter 5 may be a cut-off filter (moving average filter) that the lowest frequency of the dips of the gain thereof is 10 Hz. In this case, since 50 Hz and 60 Hz are each an integral multiple of 10 Hz, the dips of the gain are obtained for both the frequencies. Therefore, the noise immunity can be improved for both 50 Hz and 60 Hz commercial frequencies as in the second embodiment. In this case, however, there is a disadvantage in that it takes time in processing of analog-to-digital conversion as compared with the second embodiment.",
        "In the above embodiments, the measures against noise derived from the 50 Hz or 60 Hz commercial frequency are illustrated. However, noise is not limited to noise derived from the commercial frequency. Under the environment where the \u03a3\u0394 analog-to-digital converter is used, if the frequency of the noise is fixed, the invention can be applied to provide the advantage of being promoted noise immunity.",
        "In the second embodiment, the measures against noises derived from the two frequencies are shown by way of example, but cut-off filters of three or more frequencies can also be combined against noises of three or more frequencies.",
        "The invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described above. The invention can be widely applied to \u03a3\u0394 analog-to-digital converters each including a \u03a3\u0394 conversion section and a digital filter."
