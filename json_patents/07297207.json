        "This application is a divisional patent application of commonly-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/413,650, filed Apr. 15, 2003, entitled \u201cBiodegradable Dispersants for Cement Compositions and Methods of Cementing in Subterranean Formations,\u201d by B. Raghava Reddy, et al., which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.",
        "The present invention relates to subterranean cementing operations, and more particularly, to improved cement dispersants for cement compositions and methods of cementing in subterranean formations.",
        "Hydraulic cement compositions are commonly utilized in subterranean applications including but not limited to well completion and remedial operations. For example, in well applications, hydraulic cement compositions are used in primary cementing operations whereby strings of pipe such as casing and liners are cemented in well bores. In performing primary cementing, a hydraulic cement composition is pumped into the annular space between the walls of a well bore and the exterior surface of the pipe string disposed therein. The cement composition is permitted to set in the annular space, thereby forming an annular sheath of hardened substantially impermeable cement therein that substantially supports and/or positions the pipe string in the well bore and bonds the exterior surfaces of the pipe string to the walls of the well bore. Hydraulic cement compositions are also used in remedial cementing operations such as plugging highly permeable zones or fractures in well bores, plugging cracks in holes in pipe strings, and the like.",
        "Dispersants are often used in subterranean well cement compositions to facilitate mixing the cement composition. Such dispersants are extensively used, inter alia, to reduce the apparent viscosities of the cement compositions in which they are utilized to allow the cement composition to be pumped with less friction pressure and less horsepower. In addition, the lower viscosity often allows the cement composition to be pumped in turbulent flow. Turbulent flow characteristics are desirable, for instance, when pumping cement compositions into subterranean wells to more efficiently remove drilling fluid from surfaces in the well bore as the drilling fluid is displaced by the cement composition being pumped. The inclusion of dispersants in cement compositions is also desirable in that the presence of the dispersants may facilitate the mixing of the cement compositions and reduce the water required. This may be desirable because cement compositions having reduced water content are often characterized by improved compressive strength development.",
        "A number of dispersing agents have been utilized heretofore in cement compositions, particularly in cement compositions used for primary and remedial cementing in subterranean wells. One of the most common cement slurry dispersants is a condensate product of sulfonated naphthalene and formaldehyde. Such dispersants are problematic, however, because they are not substantially biodegradable, and hence, do not meet the regulatory requirements in some countries for use as dispersants.",
        "Another conventional cement composition dispersant is the condensation product of formaldehyde, acetone, and an alkali metal sulfite. One formulation of this conventional dispersant is commercially available under the trade designation \u201cCFR-3\u201d from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., of Duncan, Okla. While this and other similar dispersants may function well as dispersants in cement compositions, they are often environmentally unacceptable for use in wells subject to more stringent environmental regulations. Their unacceptability in these environments stems from, inter alia, their inability to undergo complete biodegradation in the environment, which may result in undesirable environmental effects if either accidentally or intentionally released into the environment.",
        "The present invention provides biodegradable cement slurry dispersants, cement compositions comprising such dispersants, and methods of cementing in a subterranean formation.",
        "In one embodiment, a hydraulic cement composition may comprise a cement; water; and a dispersant wherein the dispersant comprises a low molecular weight starch that comprises anionic groups.",
        "In another embodiment, a hydraulic cement composition for use in subterranean formations may comprise a cement; water wherein the water is present in an amount in the range of from about 30% to about 110% by weight of the cement in the hydraulic cement composition; and a biodegradable dispersant wherein the biodegradable dispersant comprises a low molecular weight starch that comprises anionic groups wherein the low molecular weight starch has a molecular weight of about 1,000 to about 5,000 wherein the dispersant is present in the cement composition in an amount of from about 0.01% to abut 5%.",
        "The features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. While numerous changes may be made by those skilled in the art, such changes are within the spirit of the invention.",
        "The biodegradable dispersants of the present invention comprise a starch-based material. Starch is a polymer of glucose in which monosaccharide units are linked by 1,4\u2032-\u03b1-glycoside bonds. Starches suitable for use in accordance with the present invention may be obtained from renewable glucose sources such as potatoes, corn, maize, tapioca, other cereal grains, and the like. Combinations of starches from combinations of sources are also suitable. The starch-based dispersants of the present invention are advantageous, because they are, inter alia, biodegradable and should not cause undesirable environmental effects.",
        "The starches used in the present invention preferably should be characterized by a low molecular weight, in the range of about 500 to about 10,000, or more preferably about 1,000 to about 5,000. Examples of low molecular weight starches include dextrinized starches and starches degraded with acids, peroxides, or other oxidizing agents. For dextrinized starches, heat or acid treatment methods may reduce the molecular weight of the starch. These starches can be used with or without reacting them with suitable reagent groups to add anionic groups that may increase their dispersing ability as discussed below.",
        "In the case of non-oxidized, low molecular weight starches such as acid, peroxide, or heat degraded starches, the starch can be further reacted with suitable reagents to introduce anionic groups. Similarly, to enhance the dispersing action of any suitable starch, the starch may be modified to incorporate anionic charges. Anionic groups that may be useful include but are not limited to: sulfite, sulfate, sultonate, carboxylate, silicate, nitrate, and nitrite groups. These anionic groups can be added to the starch by reacting the starch with an agent capable of producing the anionic groups, including but not limited to hypochlorite, peracetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, sodium periodate, sodium persulfate, sodium percarbonate, propane sultone, butane sultone, chloroacetic acid, dinitrogen tetroxide, 3-chloropropyl-triethoxy silane, 3-glycidoxy-propyltrimethoxy-silane, or the like.",
        "Additionally, when the starch contains substantially carbonyl groups, particularly aldehyde groups, it can be further reacted with a sulfite salt to provide a sulfite adduct of an oxidized starch; sulfite adducts of oxidized starches are especially suitable for use in accordance with the present invention. Another method of forming a sulfite adduct of an oxidized starch includes reacting an acetone formaldehyde condensate with starch under alkaline conditions, followed by addition of a sulfite salt as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,247,086. Other suitable starches include propylene oxide modified starches, ethylene oxide modified starches, and lightly crosslinked starches.",
        "In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the starch in the dispersant is oxidized. Oxidation of starches either with hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, sodium periodate, or the like is suitable as such oxidation is likely to produce starch molecules that have carbonyl groups, particularly aldehydes, and carboxylate groups. When the oxidized starch comprises carboxylate groups, the material itself may be used as dispersant or further reacted with a sulfite salt to produce dispersant containing both sulfite and carboxylate anionic groups.",
        "The anionic groups discussed above are thought to provide, inter alia, dispersing action in highly viscous slurries, e.g., slurries having a low water to cement ratio, or slurries containing a large fraction of solids, without substantially affecting the time in which the cement composition sets therein.",
        "The solubility and storage characteristics of the dispersants of the present invention depend at least in part on the structural features of the starch or starches utilized. For example, one type of starch contains two components, namely a linear polymer molecule referred to as amylose, and a branched polymer molecule referred to as amylopectin. High amylose starches are typically not cold-water soluble. Heating such starch suspensions usually dissolves the starch. Upon cooling, the solutions become viscous gels. Additionally, these solutions may continue to viscosify with time due to the alignment of linear starch molecules in a process called retrogradation. Such high amylose starches, when modified to function as dispersants for cement slurries, may be more suitable for dry blending. On the other hand, high amylopectin-containing starches are significantly more cold-water soluble and the solutions are less likely to gel at room temperature. Such starches may be more amenable to a liquid form. Additionally, as will be recognized by those skilled in the art with the benefit of this disclosure, the water solubility of starches can further be increased by introducing low levels of cationic groups in the form of quaternary ammonium groups. Such cationizations are carried out by reacting starch with, e.g., glycidylpropyltrialkylammonium salts. This may decrease the tendency of a starch to gel while stored.",
        "The biodegradable dispersants of the present invention may be utilized in any subterranean cementing applications. All cements suitable for use in subterranean cementing operations may be used in accordance with the present invention. In one embodiment, the improved cement compositions of the present invention comprise a hydraulic cement, sufficient water to form a pumpable slurry, and a biodegradable starch-based dispersant of the present invention in an amount effective to reduce the apparent viscosity of the cement composition prior to when it gels and sets. In certain embodiments, the biodegradable dispersant of the present invention is included in the cement composition in the amount of from about 0.01% to about 5.0%. In other embodiments, the dispersant may be added in a range of from about 0.2% to 3.0%. A variety of hydraulic cements can be utilized in accordance with the present invention including those comprised of calcium, aluminum, silicon, oxygen, and/or sulfur, which set and harden by reaction with water. Such hydraulic cements include, but are not limited to, Portland cements, pozzolana cements, gypsum cements, high alumina content cements, silica cements, and high alkalinity cements. Portland cements are generally preferred. In some embodiments, the Portland cements that are suited for use in conjunction with the present invention are classified as Class A, C, H, and G cements according to American Petroleum Institute, API Specification for Materials and Testing for Well Cements, API Specification 10, Fifth Ed., Jul. 1, 1990. Another useful cement for certain embodiments of the present invention include a cement that is commercial available under the tradename \u201cTHERMALOCK\u2122\u201d from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., in Duncan, Okla., and described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,488,763, herein incorporated by reference. The dispersants of the present invention are also suitable for use with low-density cements. Such low-density cements may be foamed cements or may be cements comprising another means to reduce their density such as hollow microspheres, low-density elastic beads, or other density-reducing additives known in the art.",
        "The dispersants of the present invention can be used in a liquid or solid form, depending on the application. For example, a dispersant of the present invention in a powder form can be blended with dry cement prior to mixing with water. Such dry blends are generally preferred when the wells to be cemented are on land. In offshore applications, it is preferred that the dispersants are in a solution or suspension form.",
        "The water utilized in the cement compositions of this invention can be fresh water, salt water (e.g., water containing one or more salts dissolved therein), brine (e.g., saturated salt water produced from subterranean formations), or seawater. Generally, the water can be from any source provided that it does not contain an excess of compounds that adversely affect other components in the cement composition. The water preferably is present in an amount sufficient to form a pumpable slurry. More particularly, the water is present in the cement compositions in an amount in the range of from about 30% to about 110% by weight of hydraulic cement therein, more preferably in an amount of about 40%.",
        "One example of a composition of the cement compositions of the present invention is comprised of a hydraulic cement; water present in an amount in the range of from about 30 to 110% by weight of cement in the composition; and a starch-based biodegradable dispersant of the present invention, present in an amount in the range of from about 0.2 to 3.0% by weight of cement in the composition.",
        "As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, when the cement compositions of the present invention are utilized for primary or remedial subterranean well operation, such compositions can also include additional additives such as fluid loss additives, weighting materials, light weight material, set retarders, accelerators, and the like. The cement compositions also can include other additives such as accelerators or retarders, if desired. If an accelerant is used, it is preferably calcium chloride. Also, if used, in certain embodiments, such accelerants are present in an amount in the range from about 1.0% to about 4.0% by weight of the cement in the compositions. Fluid loss additives such as hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, carboxymethylhydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylguar, guar, polyvinylalcohol, synthetic polyelectrolytes are also suitable.",
        "To facilitate a better understanding of the present invention, the following examples of certain aspects of some embodiments are given. In no way should the following examples be read to limit, or define, the scope of the invention.",
        "A number of test cement compositions were prepared using a Standard Grade Class A hydraulic cement mixed with a sufficient amount of fresh water to form a pumpable slurry. One of the test compositions contained a conventional dispersant, specifically CFR-3 dispersant, and other samples contained examples of dispersants of the present invention. Another control sample was tested wherein no dispersant was added to the cement composition. In addition, to illustrate the effects of oxidizing the starch, another control sample was tested wherein the starch in the starch-based dispersant was not oxidized prior to combining it with the cement.",
        "Tables 1, 2 and 3 list the characteristics of the illustrative dispersants of the present invention that were tested. Table 4 indicates how much and which type of the dispersant of the present invention were added to a given cement composition. Tables 5A and 5B list the rheological properties of the cement compositions comprising the dispersants of the present invention.
