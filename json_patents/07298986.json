        "This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 2004-24739, filed on Apr. 10, 2004, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present general inventive concept relates to an image forming apparatus, and more particularly, to an image forming apparatus in which an operation panel can freely move within a predetermined angle range with respect to a housing.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Generally, an image forming apparatus, such as a printer and a copying machine, outputs visible images onto paper in response to image signals.",
        "A conventional image forming apparatus includes an operation panel provided with several buttons to operate a developing unit for image development and the like.",
        "The operation panel is disposed on an upper side of a main body of the conventional image forming apparatus. In a case where the conventional image forming apparatus includes a large capacity main body or is used as a multipurpose office automation device, users of the conventional image forming apparatus must stand to operate the buttons.",
        "This may be unfavorable to handicapped users, like children who are generally short, or disabled persons who cannot stand.",
        "Even in the case of average users, a sitting position may be disadvantageous in operating the conventional image forming apparatus.",
        "Therefore, user-friendly technology to operate panel buttons is required in order to allow both disabled users and average users to operate the operation panel in a sitting position.",
        "The present general inventive concept provides an image forming apparatus including an improved operation panel that can freely move within a predetermined angle range with respect to a housing.",
        "Additional aspects and advantages of the present general inventive concept will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the general inventive concept.",
        "The foregoing and/or other aspects and advantages of the present general inventive concept are achieved by providing an image forming apparatus including a housing, an operation panel movably installed at the housing via a rotary shaft and having multiple buttons provided thereon, and a position adjustment unit to move the operation panel within a predetermined angle range with respect to the housing and to maintain the operation panel at a predetermined angle.",
        "These and/or other aspects and advantages of the present general inventive concept will become apparent and more readily appreciated from the following description of the embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings of which:",
        "FIG. 1 is a perspective view illustrating an image forming apparatus including a position adjustment unit according to an embodiment of the present general inventive concept;",
        "FIG. 2 is an exploded perspective view illustrating the position adjustment unit of FIG. 1;",
        "FIGS. 3 and 4 are views illustrating an operation of the position adjustment unit of FIG. 1;",
        "FIG. 5 is a perspective view illustrating a position adjustment unit according to another embodiment of the present general inventive concept;",
        "FIG. 6 is a sectional view illustrating a position adjustment unit according to still another embodiment of the present general inventive concept; and",
        "FIG. 7 is a sectional view illustrating an operation of the position adjustment unit of FIG. 6.",
        "Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present general inventive concept, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below in order to explain the present general inventive concept while referring to the figures.",
        "FIG. 1 is a perspective view illustrating an image forming apparatus including a position adjustment unit according to an embodiment of the present general inventive concept, FIG. 2 is an exploded perspective view illustrating the position adjustment unit of FIG. 1, and FIGS. 3 and 4 are views illustrating an operation of the position adjustment unit of FIG. 1.",
        "Referring to FIG. 1, the image forming apparatus includes a housing 100, an operation panel 120 installed at an upper side of the housing 100 to move upward and downward via a rotary shaft 121 connected thereto and having operation buttons 122 provided thereon to operate an image forming unit (not shown) to form an image and other parts provided in the housing 100, and a position adjustment unit 130 to maintain the operation panel 120 at a predetermined angle with respect to the housing 100.",
        "Referring to FIG. 2, the position adjustment unit 130 includes a bracket 131, a swing gear 133, an interlocking gear 134, and an angle adjusting plate 135.",
        "The bracket 131 is rotatably installed at a bracket shaft (123, see FIG. 3) attached to the housing 100 and is provided with first and second shafts 132 and 132\u2032 at which the swing gear 133 and the interlocking gear 134 are rotatably mounted, respectively.",
        "The bracket 131 is connected to an elastic part 136. The elastic part 136 has an end fixed to the housing 100 and causes the bracket 131 rotated about the bracket shaft 123 to return to an original position.",
        "The swing gear 133 is rotatably mounted on the first shaft 132. Teeth 1331 are formed along a predetermined length of an outer periphery of the swing gear 133 and a lever 1332 extends from the swing gear 133.",
        "The interlocking gear 134 is rotatably mounted on the second shaft 132\u2032. Teeth 1341 are formed on an outer periphery of the interlocking gear 134 and engage with the teeth 1331 of the swing gear 133.",
        "The angle adjusting plate 135 is installed at the rotary shaft 121 and has teeth 1351 on an outer periphery thereof. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the angle adjusting plate 135 is provided at an end of the rotary shaft 121. Alternatively, teeth may be formed on an outer periphery of the rotary shaft 121.",
        "Referring to FIG. 3, the bracket 131 is elastically biased away from the angle adjusting plate 135 by an elasticity of the elastic part 136. Therefore, the teeth 1341 of the interlocking gear 134 can be separated from the teeth 1351 of the angle adjusting plate 135.",
        "Referring to FIG. 4, when a user presses the lever 1332 toward the angle adjusting plate 135, the bracket 131 approaches the angle adjusting plate 135 while rotating in a counter-clockwise direction (A) about the bracket shaft 123 and the teeth 1341 of the interlocking gear 134 engage with the teeth 1351 of the angle adjusting plate 135.",
        "In this state, to rotate the rotary shaft 121 and adjust the operation panel 120, the user can move the lever 1332 in an arrow direction (B) to rotate the swing gear 133 in a counter-clockwise direction. The teeth 1331 of the swing gear 133 engage the teeth 1341 of the interlocking gear 134 to rotate the interlocking gear 134 in a clockwise direction. The teeth of the interlocking gear 1341 engage the teeth 1351 of the angle adjusting plate 135 to rotate the angle adjusting plate 135 and the rotary shaft 121 in a counter clockwise direction. When the user stops moving the lever 1332, the bracket 131 returns to an original position, in which the teeth 1341 of the interlocking gear 134 are separated from the teeth 1351 of the angle adjusting plate 135, by the elasticity of the elastic part 136.",
        "The rotation of the rotary shaft 121, as described above, allows the operation panel 120 to be maintained at a predetermined angle with respect to the housing 100.",
        "Meanwhile, the user can move the lever 1332 in an opposite direction to the direction B to rotate the rotary shaft 121 in a clockwise direction to adjust the angle of the operation panel 120 with respect to the housing 100.",
        "FIG. 5 is a perspective view illustrating a position adjustment unit 230 according to another embodiment of the present general inventive concept. The position adjustment unit 230 includes an angle adjusting plate 231 and an operator 232.",
        "The angle adjusting plate 231 is fixed to an end of the rotary shaft 121 and teeth 2311 are formed on an outer periphery of the angle adjusting plate 231.",
        "The operator 232 is rotatably installed at the housing 100. The operator 232 includes an operation lever 2321 at an end thereof and a fixing portion 2322 at another end thereof. The fixing portion 2322 engages with the teeth 2311 of the angle adjusting plate 231 so that the angle adjusting plate 231 cannot be rotated.",
        "The fixing portion 2322 is connected to an elastic part 233, an end of which is fixed at the housing 100, and is elastically biased upward by the elastic part 233. Therefore, the fixing portion 2322 can prevent the angle adjusting plate 231 from rotating.",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 5, a tensile coil spring can be used as the elastic part 233. Alternatively, the operator 232 may be formed as a twisted spring.",
        "An operation of the position adjustment unit 230 of FIG. 5 will now be described.",
        "When the operation lever 2321 moves in a direction C, the fixing portion 2322 moves downward as shown by a dotted line. In this state, engagement between the fixing portion 2322 and the teeth 2311 of the angle adjustment part 231 is removed and the rotary shaft 121 can rotate freely. Therefore, a user can rotate the rotary shaft 121 to adjust the operation panel (see 120 of FIG. 1) by a desired angle with respect to the housing (see 100 of FIG. 1).",
        "When the user releases the operation lever 2321 after the operation panel 120 is adjusted to the desired angle with respect to the housing 100 as described above, the lever 2321 moves in a direction D by an elasticity of the elastic part 233, and the fixing portion 2322 is positioned as shown by a solid line. Therefore, the fixing portion 2322 engages with the teeth 2311 of the angle adjusting plate 231 so that the angle adjusting plate 231 is maintained at the adjusted angle.",
        "FIG. 6 is a sectional view illustrating a position adjustment unit according to still another embodiment of the present general inventive concept, and FIG. 7 is a sectional view illustrating an operation of the position adjustment unit of FIG. 6.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 6 and 7, the position adjustment unit 330 includes a first coupling member 331, a second coupling member 332, and a release member 334.",
        "The first coupling member 331 is slidingly installed along an axis of a rotary shaft 121. The first coupling member 331 is elastically biased toward the second coupling member 332 by an elastic part 333 supported by a blocking portion 1211 provided at the rotary shaft 121. A surface of the first coupling member 331 opposite to the second coupling member 332 is formed with multiple first coupling teeth 3311 that are separated from each other by a predetermined distance.",
        "The second coupling member 332 is fixed at a housing (see 100 of FIG. 1), and a surface of the second coupling member 332 opposite to the first coupling member 331 is formed with multiple second coupling teeth 3321 separated from each other by a predetermined distance so that the second coupling teeth 3321 can engage with the first coupling teeth 3311.",
        "The release member 334 includes a support member 3342 fixed at the housing, a release shaft 3341, an end of which is slidingly supported by the support member 3342 and another end of which slidingly passes through the second coupling member 332, and a button 3343 protruding from the end of the release shaft 3341 and slidingly supported by the support member 3342.",
        "When a user pushes the button 3343, the release shaft 3341 connected to the button 3343 slides in an arrow direction through the second coupling member 332 to contact the first coupling member 331 so that the first coupling member 331 is separated from the second coupling member 332. At this time, the first coupling member 331 slides along the rotary shaft 121 in an arrow direction and presses the elastic part 333. In this state, the user adjusts a desired angle of an operation panel (see 120 of FIG. 1) with respect to the housing 100.",
        "After the operation panel 120 is adjusted by the desired angle with respect to the housing 100, when a force applied to the button 3343 is removed, the first coupling member 331 slides in an opposite direction to the arrow direction by an elasticity of the elastic part 333, and the first coupling teeth 3311 of the first coupling member 331 engage with the second coupling teeth 3321 of the second coupling member 332. At this time, the operation panel 120 is maintained at the desired angle with respect to the housing 100.",
        "Here, a sliding length of the release shaft 3341 can be longer than a distance required to separate the first coupling teeth 3311 of the first coupling member 331 and the second coupling teeth 3321 of the second coupling member 332 when the button 3343 is pushed.",
        "As describe above, an image forming apparatus according to various embodiments of the present general inventive concept allows a user to easily adjust a desired angle position of an operation panel with respect to a housing, thereby enhancing operational convenience.",
        "Although a few embodiments of the present general inventive concept have been shown and described, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the general inventive concept, the scope of which is defined in the appended claims and their equivalents."
