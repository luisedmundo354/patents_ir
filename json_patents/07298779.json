        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to fast code acquisition methods based on signed-rank statistic. In more detail, it relates to novel detectors required for PN (PN) code acquisition in direct sequence spread spectrum (DS/SS) systems.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "When the receiver and transmitter in a DS/SS system start communicating each other, the local despreading PN code sequence should first be synchronized to the incoming spreading PN code sequence. The synchronization process is normally composed of two steps: code acquisition and tracking. The code acquisition is a process of successive decisions wherein the final goal is to bring the two code sequences into (at least) coarse time alignment within a fraction g of the chip duration Tc. After the successful code acquisition, a code tracking loop is used to synchronize the two code sequences even more accurately. In the present invention, the code acquisition problem is considered.",
        "The basic unit in any acquisition receiver is a decision-making device; that is, a detector. The class of detectors can be classified as either coherent or noncoherent; according to the specific detection criteria, it can be classified into Bayes, Neyman-Pearson, and etc. In accordance with the present invention, the noncoherent Neyman-Pearson detector is considered.",
        "In the conventional parametric detector, the variance of time-varying interference has to be estimated to decide the threshold of a detector. Small deviation of the estimated value from the real value, however, may lead to a significant performance degradation of the parametric detector. The nonparametric detector based on the sign statistic has been proposed recently for the PN code acquisition problem, whose threshold can be decided without first estimating the variance of interference.",
        "Accordingly, it is therefore the object of the present invention to provide the novel nonparametric detectors, which may improve the performance of code acquisition system.",
        "The present invention relates to the fast code acquisition methods based on signed-rank statistic. In more detail, it presents novel detectors required for PN code acquisition in DS/SS system.",
        "In accordance with the present invention, first, the locally optimum rank (LOR) detector is derived and then the locally suboptimum rank (LSR) and modified signed-rank (MSR) detectors using approximate score functions are proposed. It is compared the single-dwell scheme without the verification mode using the proposed LSR and MSR detectors with that using the conventional squared-sum (SS) and modified sign (MS) detectors.",
        "Accordingly, since the threshold is determined by a test statistic of a novel detector acquired by an approximation method based on signed-rank statistic in the present invention while the threshold of a conventional detector is determined by estimating variance of interference, the performance of detectors are improved, the estimation time for the variance of interference is eliminated, and an average time for pseudo-noise code acquisition is reduced so that the system performance may be improved.",

        "FIG. 2 is a graph showing the relationship between nonlinear function and linear approximation where n=256.",
        "FIG. 3 is a graph showing the average code acquisition time as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the noncoherent Rayleigh-faded reception case, when PFA=10\u22123, n=256, Ku=10.",
        "FIG. 4 is a graph showing the average code acquisition time as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the noncoherent Rayleigh-faded reception case, when PFA=10\u22123, n=128, Ku=10",
        "The foregoing subject of the present invention can be solved effectively. In the present invention, nonparametric detectors based on signed-rank statistic are used for PN code acquisition in DS/SS systems. We first derive the LOR (LOR) detector and then propose the LSR (LSR) and MSR (MSR) detectors using approximate score functions. We apply these detectors to the single-dwell scheme with the straight-serial strategy and then investigate the performance of the code acquisition system.",

        "Now we consider the PN code acquisition problem. Consider the real straight-serial PN code acquisition scheme without the verification mode. Using the PN code sequence locally generated, we obtain the inphase and quadrature channel data XjI and XjQ, j=1,2, . . . n, evaluate a test statistic, and then compare the value of the test statistic to the threshold. Here, n is the partial correlation period. If the value of the test statistic is greater than the threshold, we decide that the locally generated PN sequence is synchronized to the incoming PN code sequence within Tc: the acquisition mode is completed and the tracking mode is started. Otherwise, the local PN code sequence is left shifted by Tc and we repeat the above procedure. The searching job will continue till the value of the test statistic is greater than the threshold. When the code tracking fails, the searching job will start again.",

        "FIG. 3 shows the average code acquisition time as a function of the SNR in the noncoherent Rayleigh-faded reception case, when PFA=10\u22123,n=256, and Ku=10. The number of Monte Carlo runs for each point is 100000. In FIG. 3, the solid, dashed, dotted, and dashdot lines represent the LSR, MSR, Ss, and MS detectors, respectively. We assume that the variance of interference is known a priori in the SS detector case. The SS detector has the best performance among the detectors compared, because it is the optimum detector in AWGN. The proposed LSR and MSR detectors perform better than the MS detector by about 2-3 dB and are nearly optimum.",
        "FIG. 4 shows the average code acquisition time as a function of the SNR in the noncoherent Rayleigh-faded reception case, when PFA=10\u22123,n=128, and Ku=10. The other conditions are the same as those of FIG. 3. The performance of the detectors shows a tendency quite similar to that in FIG. 3. A main difference is that the code acquisition time in FIG. 4 (n=128) is greater than that in FIG. 3 (n=256): the detection probability decreases, as the partial correlation period (that is, the sample size) decreases.",
