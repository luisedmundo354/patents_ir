        "This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application Numbers. 2003-36519, 2003-37245, 2003-51659 and 2003-51681, filed on Jun. 5, 2003, Jun. 10, 2003, Jul. 25, 2003 and Jul. 25, 2003 respectively, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.",
        "The present invention relates to a flat panel display device with a polycrystalline silicon thin film transistor, and more particularly, to a flat panel display device with a polycrystalline silicon thin film transistor in which the number of grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon formed in an active channel region of thin film transistor included in the flat panel display device varies according to the thin film transistor.",
        "Bonding defects such as dangling bonds existing on grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon included in active channel region are known to function as a trap for an electric charge carrier during fabrication of a thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as \u201cTFT\u201d) using polycrystalline silicon.",
        "Therefore, the size of grains, uniformity of grain size, number and position of the grains and the direction of the grains may not only have a fatal effect on TFT characteristics directly and/or indirectly, such as threshold voltage (Vth), subthreshold slope, charge carrier mobility, leakage current and device stability, but may also have a fatal effect on TFT uniformity according to position of the grains when fabricating an active matrix display substrate using TFT.",
        "The number of fatal grain boundaries (hereinafter referred to as \u201cprimary\u201d grain boundaries) included in the active channel regions of TFT all over the substrate of the display device can be equalized or varied according to size of grains, inclination angle \u03b8 of the grains, dimension of the active channel (length (L) and width (W)) and the position of each TFT on the substrate (see, for example, FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B).",
        "As illustrated in FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B, the number of \u201cprimary\u201d grain boundaries included in the active channel regions for grain size Gs, active channel dimension L\u00d7W and inclination angle \u03b8 of the grains (that is, the number of \u201cprimary\u201d grain boundaries included in the active channel regions according to position of TFT substrate or display device) is Nmax (3 in case of FIG. 1A) or Nmax-1 (2 in case of FIG. 1B) when the maximum number of grain boundaries is Nmax. More uniformity in the TFT characteristics may be secured when the number of \u201cprimary\u201d grain boundaries of Nmax for all TFTs is included in active channel regions. That is, the more each TFT has an equal number of grain boundaries, the more uniformity the device obtains.",
        "On the other hand, it may be understood that uniformity is worse in characteristics of TFTs on TFT substrates or display devices if the number of TFT including Nmax \u201cprimary\u201d grain boundaries is equal to the number of TFT including Nmax-1 \u201cprimary\u201d grain boundaries.",
        "Polycrystalline or single crystalline grains may be capable of forming large silicon grains on a substrate using sequential lateral solidification (SLS) crystallization technology (FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B). Characteristics similar to characteristics of TFT fabricated of single crystalline silicon may be obtained when fabricating TFT using the large silicon grains. However, a plurality of TFTs for driver and pixel array should be fabricated for an active matrix display.",
        "For example, approximately one million pixels are made in fabricating an active matrix display having SVGA resolution. One TFT may be required in each pixel in the case of liquid crystal display (LCD). At least two or more TFTs may be required in a display using organic light emitting materials such as organic electroluminescent device.",
        "Therefore, it may be difficult to fabricate an active matrix display by growing a certain number of grains to a certain direction only in the active channel regions of each of more than one million or two million TFTs.",
        "A technology for converting the amorphous silicon on the whole substrate into polycrystalline silicon, or for crystallizing selected regions only on the substrate using SLS technology after depositing amorphous silicon by PECVD, LPCVD or sputtering is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,322,625 as illustrated in FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B.",
        "The selected region is also quite a large region compared to an active channel region having dimension of several \u03bcm by several \u03bcm. Furthermore, the size of the laser beam used in crystallization technology is approximately several mm\u00d7scores of mm. Stepping and shifting of the laser beam or stage are required to crystallize the amorphous silicon of the whole region or a selected region on substrate, where misalignment exists between regions on which the laser beam is irradiated. Misalignment may be included in active channel regions of a plurality of TFTs. The number of grain boundaries vary, and TFT on the whole substrate or in the driver region or the pixel cell region may have unpredictable non-uniformity. The non-uniformity may have a fatal effect on an active matrix display device.",
        "Fabricating TFTs for an LCD device comprising a driver and pixel array by forming large silicon grains using SLS crystallization technology is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,177,391. Barrier effects of grain boundaries for the electric charge carrier direction may be minimized, as illustrated in FIG. 3A, so that the large silicon grains obtain TFT characteristics next to those of single crystalline when the direction of the active channels is parallel to direction of grains grown by a SLS crystallization method. Many grain boundaries in which TFT characteristics function as trap of electric charge carrier, also exist such that TFT characteristics may deteriorate, as illustrated in FIG. 3B.",
        "Practically, there are cases that a TFT inside the driver circuit and a TFT inside the pixel cell regions generally have an angle of 90\u00b0 when fabricating an active matrix display, wherein uniformity of the device can be improved by fabricating the active matrix display in such a way that the direction of the active channel regions is inclined to grain growing in a direction at an angle of 30 to 60\u00b0, so that uniform characteristics between TFTs are improved and characteristics of each TFT do not greatly deteriorate (FIG. 3C).",
        "However, it is likely that fatal grain boundaries are included in active channel regions since limited sized grains formed by SLS crystallization technology are also used in this method. Therefore, there is a problem that unpredictable non-uniformity causing a difference in characteristics between TFTs exists in this method.",
        "On the other hand, a polycrystalline silicon thin film consists of transistors to be used as a switching device or a driving device for pixels in a flat panel display device, such as an organic electroluminescent display device or a liquid display device, wherein an active driving type active matrix organic electroluminescent display device comprises at least two thin film transistors for each sub-pixel.",
        "An organic electroluminescent device comprises an emission layer formed of an organic matter between an anode electrode and a cathode electrode. In the organic electroluminescent device, holes injected from the anode electrode are moved to the emission layer via a hole transport layer as anode and cathode voltages are being applied to the respective electrodes. Electrons are injected into the emission layer from the cathode electrode via an electron transport layer so that the electrons and holes are reunited with each other in the emission layer to produce exitons, and light emitting materials of the emission layer are emitted to form a picture as the exitons are being changed from the excited state to the ground state. A full color organic electroluminescent display device comprises pixels emitting the colors red (R), green (G) and blue (B) in order to realize full colors.",
        "However, the emission efficiency (Cd/A) of each emission layer of red, green and blue for emitting each color varies by color in the organic electroluminescent display device. Furthermore, it is difficult to obtain an appropriate degree of color balance, or white balance as some colors have lower luminance while other colors have higher luminance. This may occur even when an equal current is applied to the sub-pixel since luminance of the emission layer is approximately proportional to the current values applied to each sub-pixel.",
        "For example, a corresponding amount of additional current should flow to the red and blue emission layers to adjust white balance, since the emission efficiency of the green emission layer is three to six times higher than the emission efficiency of the red emission layer and the blue emission layer.",
        "On the other hand, a method for applying different voltages supplied through a driving line, that is, a driving voltage (Vdd) to each pixel, is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. Heisei 5-107561 as a conventional method for adjusting white balance.",
        "Furthermore, a method for adjusting white balance by controlling the size of the driving TFT is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2001-109399. The amount of current flowing to respective red, green and blue organic electroluminescent devices is controlled by differently designing W/L values for each red, green and blue pixel where the channel width is W and the channel length is L in the channel regions of the driving TFT.",
        "A method for adjusting the white balance by forming different sized pixels is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2001-290441. The white balance and a long life cycle may be enabled by forming the green color emitting region in such a way that the emission area of the green color emitting region having the highest emission efficiency is the smallest compared to the emission area of the red color and the blue color emitting regions. This emission efficiency difference can be enabled by the area of the anode electrode.",
        "Additionally, one method for controlling luminance varies the voltage range applied through data lines for each red, green and blue pixel, thereby controlling the current amount.",
        "However, the foregoing methods do not consider the crystal structure of the polycrystalline silicon in a TFT of a flat panel display device using polycrystalline silicon. Current mobility can be varied according to the crystal state of the polycrystalline silicon included in the active channel regions of TFT. Even in this case, the white balance may not be adjusted.",
        "Furthermore, a flat panel display device is driven by generally using complementary metal oxide semiconductor thin film transistor (CMOS TFT) in constructing circuits in the flat panel display device.",
        "However, an absolute value of the threshold voltage of a TFT is generally larger than an absolute value of the threshold voltage of a MOS transistor using a single crystalline semiconductor. Furthermore, an absolute value of the threshold voltage of an N type thin film transistor is quite different from an absolute value of the threshold of a P type thin film transistor. For example, if the threshold voltage of the N type thin film transistor is 2 V, the threshold of the P type thin film transistor may be \u22124 V.",
        "Therefore, a great threshold voltage absolute value difference between the P type thin film transistor and N type thin film transistor may not be desirable in operating circuits, and it may function as a barrier in reducing the driving voltage. For example, typically, a P type thin film transistor having a large threshold voltage absolute value not properly operated at a lower driving voltage.",
        "That is, the P type thin film transistor generally functions only as a passive element, such as a resistor, and is not operated fast enough. It may be necessary to increase the driving voltage to operate the P type thin film transistor just as a passive element.",
        "Particularly, a difference in the work function between the gate electrode and the intrinsic silicon semiconductor may be decreased as much as \u22120.6 eV in the case where the gate electrode is formed of a material having a work function of 5 eV or less, such as aluminum. Consequently, the threshold voltage of the P type thin film transistor is shifted to a negative value while threshold voltage of the N type thin film transistor approaches a zero voltage. Therefore, the N type thin film transistor generally becomes the on-state.",
        "In the above state, it is desirable that the threshold voltage absolute value of the N type thin film transistor be almost equal to that of the P type thin film transistor. The threshold voltage has been controlled by doping N type or P type impurities at a very low concentration of 1018 atoms/cm3 or less. That is, the threshold voltage has been controlled to about 0.1 V or less by doping impurities having a concentration of 1015 to 1018 atoms/cm3.",
        "However, a shift of the threshold voltage may not observed even if impurities are added to the semiconductor in a concentration of 1018 atoms/cm3 or less when using a semiconductor that is not a single crystalline semiconductor. Furthermore, the threshold voltage is rapidly changed, and the conductivity becomes p-type or n-type if the concentration of impurities is 1018 atoms/cm3 or more, since the polycrystalline silicon has many defects. The added impurities are trapped and can not be activated by the defects since the defect concentration is 1018 atoms/cm3. Furthermore, the concentration of the impurities is larger than the concentration of the defects, excess impurities are activated, and the conductive type is changed to n or p type.",
        "In order to solve these problems, the length of the channels is varied so that the channel length of a P type thin film transistor is shorter than that of an N type thin film transistor, such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,492,268, 6,124,603 and 5,615,935. However, these patents also have problems in that the manufacturing process is complicated, since the channels are manufactured in such a way that length of the channels is different.",
        "Therefore, in order to solve the foregoing problems of the prior art, it is an object of the present invention to provide a flat panel display device comprising thin film transistor using polycrystalline silicon capable of satisfying TFT characteristics of a driving circuit portion and TFT characteristics of a pixel portion when forming polycrystalline silicon.",
        "Furthermore, it is another object to provide a flat panel display device comprising a thin film transistor using polycrystalline silicon capable of satisfying characteristics of a driving thin film transistor and a switching thin film transistor positioned at a pixel portion when forming the polycrystalline silicon thin film.",
        "Furthermore, it is another object to provide a CMOS thin film transistor in which the threshold voltage absolute value of a P type thin film transistor is substantially the same as that of an N type thin film transistor, and which has a high current mobility by controlling the number of grains as equally maintaining length of channels.",
        "Furthermore, it is another object to provide a flat panel display device in which white balance is adjusted. Appropriate luminance is obtained by supplying the optimum current to each sub-pixel. The life cycle is not shortened when the same driving voltage is applied to the driving TFT without changing of size of the active channels of driving TFT.",
        "In order to achieve the foregoing object, the present invention provides a flat panel display device with a polycrystalline silicon thin film transistor comprising a pixel portion divided into gate lines and data lines and equipped with a thin film transistor driven by signals applied to the gate lines and data lines. A driving circuit portion comprises one or more thin film transistors connected to the gate lines and the data lines respectively, to apply signals to the pixel portion, wherein the average number of grain boundaries of the polycrystalline silicon, which are formed in the active channel regions of the thin film transistor installed at the driving circuit portion and meet the current direction line, is at least one or more less than the average number of grain boundaries of the polycrystalline silicon which are formed in active channel regions of thin film transistor installed at the pixel portion and meet the current direction line for a unit area of active channels.",
        "Furthermore, the present invention provides a flat panel display device with polycrystalline silicon thin film transistor comprising a switching thin film transistor for transmitting data signals and a driving thin film transistor for driving the organic electroluminescent device, so that a certain amount of current flows through organic electroluminescent device according to the data signals. The average number of grain boundaries of the polycrystalline silicon which are formed in active channel regions of the driving thin film transistor and meet a current direction line is at least one or more greater than the average number of grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon which are formed in active channel regions of the switching thin film transistor and meet a current direction line for a unit area of active channels.",
        "Furthermore, the present invention provides a CMOS thin film transistor characterized in that a P type thin film transistor and an N type thin film transistor have a different number of primary grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon included in an active channel regions. The number of grain boundaries included in the P type thin film transistor is at least one or more less than the number of grain boundaries included in the N type thin film transistor.",
        "Furthermore, the present invention provides a flat panel display device comprising green, red and blue pixel regions, and a driving thin film transistor for driving the pixels having the same length and width of active channels, wherein the number of grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon included in active channel regions of a driving thin film transistor is different from each other for each pixel.",

        "FIG. 21 is a graph illustrating a change in current mobility according to the number of primary grain boundaries. Referring to FIG. 21, current mobility of a PMOS thin film transistor or an NMOS thin film transistor may be linearly reduced as the number of primary grain boundaries is being increased.",
        "FIG. 22 is a graph illustrating change of current mobility according to the number of side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains. Current mobility of a PMOS thin film transistor or an NMOS thin film transistor may also be reduced as the number of side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains is being increased.",
        "Current mobility characteristics may be improved compared to when the primary grain boundaries are parallel to the direction of current flowing from the source to the drain, since primary grain boundaries may have more effect on the number of grain boundaries capable of functioning as trap for current flow than side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains.",
        "Uniformity of a TFT may be secured, since variations for position change inside the substrate of active channels is less (e.g., variation changes when the number of grain boundaries is changed from one to two and when the number of grain boundaries is changed from 100 to 102), while current characteristics may degrade due to an increase in the number of grain boundaries. A trap may result when the electric charge carrier traverses one or more of the grain boundaries (e.g., side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains), in case that \u201cprimary\u201d grain boundaries are parallel to current direction.",
        "Side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains may have small variations according to the current movement in accordance with the change in the number of grain boundaries, although \u201cprimary\u201d grain boundaries may have large variations according to current movement in accordance with the change of the number of grain boundaries.",
        "Therefore, this current value difference in the present invention may be accomplished by changing the number of primary grain boundaries and/or the number of side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains of polycrystalline silicon included in active channel regions of the second thin film transistor of FIG. 19, e.g., a driving thin film transistor for supplying current to emission device. A current value supplied to the emission device of each sub-pixel, for example, an organic electroluminescent device, may be changed by changing the number of primary grain boundaries included in active channel regions of a first thin film transistor of red, green and blue sub-pixels.",
        "The number of primary grain boundaries included in active channels of the second thin film transistor may be determined by a current value flowing to each sub-pixel at the same driving voltage. Therefore, the number of primary grain boundaries included in active channel regions of the second thin film transistor of the green sub-pixels may be controlled to the minimum in such a way that the current value of the green sub-pixels having the highest luminance becomes the lowest to adjust white balance. Alternatively, the number of primary grain boundaries included in each active channel region of the second red thin film transistor, the second blue thin film transistor and the second green thin film transistor may be controlled in such a way that the current value for each sub-pixel is lowered in the order of red, blue and green sub-pixels. Therefore, luminance of each sub-pixel may be complemented so that the white balance is adjusted accordingly.",
        "The number of primary grain boundaries included in active channel regions of the second thin film transistor may also be determined by the electric charge mobility of the active channel regions, since more current flows if the electric charge mobility in the active channel regions is higher while less of current flows if the electric charge mobility in the active channel regions is lower.",
        "Therefore, the number of primary grain boundaries included in active channel regions of a second thin film transistor of a green sub-pixel may be controlled in such a way that the electric charge mobility of the green sub-pixel having the highest emission efficiency is lowered to the minimum to adjust the white balance. The number of primary grain boundaries included in active channel regions of the second thin film transistor of each sub-pixel may be controlled in such a way that the number of primary grain boundaries is increased in the order of red, blue and green sub-pixels, or the number of primary grain boundaries may be equivalent to each other in the blue and green sub-pixels.",
        "The number of the primary grain boundaries may be increased in the order of primary grain boundaries included in active channel regions of a second thin film transistor of the red sub-pixel, primary grain boundaries included in active channel regions of a second thin film transistor of the blue sub-pixel and primary grain boundaries included in active channel regions of a second thin film transistor of the green sub-pixel, so that the active channel regions of the second thin film transistor of the red sub-pixel has the highest electric charge mobility.",
        "Accordingly, the respective sub-pixels have different current values as mentioned above so that luminance of each sub-pixel is supplemented to adjust white balance. Furthermore, the number of grain boundaries included in active channel regions of the second thin film transistor varies according to the emitting material for forming the emitting layer, and the number of grain boundaries included in active channel regions of the second thin film transistor of each sub-pixel may be set based on the green sub-pixel after obtaining the luminance of each pixel and current ratio for adjusting the white balance in advance.",
        "Structure and fabrication method for an organic electroluminescent device according to an embodiment of the present invention are described as follows referring to FIG. 23, FIG. 24 and FIG. 25.",
        "FIG. 23 is a partially enlarged plan figure illustrating a single pixel of FIG. 19. FIG. 24 is a cross sectional view illustrating a cross section cut along a line II-II in FIG. 23. FIG. 25 is a cross sectional view illustrating a cross section cut along a line III-III in FIG. 23.",

The buffer layer 302 can be formed of SiO2 and deposited by PECVD, APCVD, LPCVD and/or ECR. The buffer layer 302 may be deposited to a thickness of approximately 3,000 \u212b.",
        "An amorphous silicon thin film may be deposited on the upper part of the buffer layer 302 to a thickness of approximately 500 \u212b. The amorphous silicon thin film can be crystallized into polycrystalline silicon thin film by various methods, wherein the crystallized polycrystalline silicon thin film comprises primary grain boundaries longitudinally extended, and side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains perpendicular to the primary grain boundaries as shown in FIG. 20. Although SLS method is used to obtain the foregoing crystal structure in an embodiment of the present invention, any crystallization method capable of obtaining this crystal structure may also be used.",
        "The polycrystalline silicon thin film may be crystallized for each pixel, with mask patterns being changed to control the number of grain boundaries included in each pixel. That is, a superposition ratio in which mask patterns are superposed so that many grain boundaries are included in active channel regions of a driving thin film transistor may be lowered to lower the current value and current mobility in the case of a green pixel region. On the other hand, crystallization is performed through irradiation of the laser beam with mask patterns having as high a superposition ratio as possible to reduce the number of grain boundaries included in active channel regions of a driving thin film transistor in the case of a red region having low luminance efficiency.",
        "The grain boundaries comprise both primary grain boundaries and side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains.",
        "Polycrystalline silicon thin film may be formed in such a way that the number of grain boundaries included in active channel regions of a driving thin film transistor is changed by changing the superposition ratio of the mask patterns for each pixel.",
        "The active channel regions of the second thin film transistor may be patterned so that active channel regions of the second thin film transistor for each sub-pixel are perpendicular to the direction of the grain boundaries, as shown in FIG. 19, after forming the polycrystalline silicon thin film, wherein the grain boundaries are primary grain boundaries and/or side grain boundaries of anisotropic grains, and active channel regions of the first thin film transistor are also patterned at the same time.",
        "A gate insulation film may be formed by depositing SiO2 on the patterned active channel regions by a PECVD, APCVD, LPCVD and/or ECR method after patterning the active channel regions. A gate electrode may be formed by patterning the conductive film after forming a conductive film on the gate insulation film using MoW, Al/Cu, etc. The active channel regions, gate insulation film and gate electrode may be patterned by various sequences and methods.",
        "N type or P type impurities may be doped on source and drain regions of the active channel regions, gate insulation film and gate electrode after patterning the active channel regions, gate insulation film and gate electrode.",
        "Source electrodes 314, 324 and drain electrodes 315, 325 are connected to active channel regions 311, 321 through contact holes, and planarization film 306 may be formed after forming interlayer insulation film 304 and passivation film 305 as shown in FIG. 24 and FIG. 25 after finishing the doping process. These films may adopt various structures according to device design.",
        "On the other hand, EL device 340 connected to second thin film transistor may be formed by various methods, wherein the anode electrode 341 is patterned and an organic film 342 is formed on the patterned anode electrode after first forming an anode electrode 341 connected to the drain electrode 325 of the second thin film transistor 320 by ITO. A low molecular or high molecular organic film may be used as the organic film 342, wherein when of using the low molecular organic film, a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, an organic emitting layer, an electron transport layer and an electron injection layer may be formed or laminated in a single or composite structure.

The low molecular organic film may be formed by vacuum deposition method.",
        "The high molecular organic film may have a structure having a hole transport layer (HTL) and an emitting layer (EML), wherein a PEDOT is used as the hole transport layer, a high molecular organic material such as a PPV (poly-phenylenevinylene) series and a polyfluorene is used as the emitting layer, and the hole transport layer and the emitting layer are formed by screen printing or inkjet printing method",
