    "description": [
        "This invention is directed generally to turbine airfoils, and more particularly to hollow turbine airfoils having cooling channels for passing fluids, such as air, to cool the airfoils.",
        "Typically, gas turbine engines include a compressor for compressing air, a combustor for mixing the compressed air with fuel and igniting the mixture, and a turbine blade assembly for producing power. Combustors often operate at high temperatures that may exceed 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Typical turbine combustor configurations expose turbine vane and blade assemblies to these high temperatures. As a result, turbine vanes and blades must be made of materials capable of withstanding such high temperatures. In addition, turbine vanes and blades often contain cooling systems for prolonging the life of the vanes and blades and reducing the likelihood of failure as a result of excessive temperatures.",
        "Typically, turbine airfoils are formed from an elongated portion having a tip at one end and a root coupled to a platform at an opposite end of the airfoil. The root is configured to be coupled to a disc. The airfoil is ordinarily composed of a leading edge, a trailing edge, a suction side, and a pressure side. The inner aspects of most turbine airfoils typically contain an intricate maze of cooling circuits forming a cooling system. The cooling circuits in the airfoils receive air from the compressor of the turbine engine and pass the air through film cooling channels throughout the airfoil. The cooling circuits often include multiple flow paths that are designed to maintain all aspects of the turbine airfoil at a relatively uniform temperature. At least some of the air passing through these cooling circuits is exhausted through orifices in the leading edge, trailing edge, suction side, and pressure side of the airfoil.",
        "Many conventional turbine airfoils have cooling channels positioned at the leading and trailing edges and the outer walls. The airfoils often have a mid-chord cooling channel that may have a serpentine configuration or other design. Often times, the cooling channel is pressurized with cooling fluids to provide adequate cooling fluids to all portions of the cooling channels forming the cooling system in the airfoil. The walls forming the pressurized mid-chord cooling channel often remain at temperatures much lower than other portions of the airfoil in contact with hot combustion gases, thereby resulting in a large thermal gradient between these regions. The large thermal gradient often results in a reduced mechanical life cycle of airfoil components and poor thermal mechanical fatigue (TMF). Therefore, the inner cooling channel often negatively affects the life cycle of the airfoil. Thus, a need exists for a turbine airfoil having increased cooling efficiency for dissipating heat while reducing the thermal gradient between the cooling channels and the hot combustion gases.",
        "FIG. 1 shows an external pressure profile for an airfoil. For a conventional five pass serpentine mid-chord cooling channel, cooling fluid is discharged on the pressure and suction sides. The pressure side of the airfoil has a higher external pressure than the suction side, and thereby is used to determine the pressure of the cooling fluid within the cooling system of the airfoil. In order to meet back flow margin criteria, a high cooling supply pressure is needed for this particular design, which results in a large leakage flow of cooling fluids. The second, third, and fourth passes of the serpentine cooling channel typically include film cooling holes for both the pressure and suction sides. In order to meet the back flow margin criteria for the pressure side film cooling holes, the pressure of the cooling fluid within the serpentine cooling channel is approximately ten percent higher than the pressure side external hot gas pressure. This results in over-pressurizing the suction side film cooling holes, which results in tremendous cooling system inefficiencies.",
        "This invention is directed to a turbine airfoil having a cooling system in inner aspects of the turbine airfoil for use in turbine engines. The cooling system may be used in any turbine blade. The cooling system may include a pressure side serpentine cooling channel nested with a suction side serpentine cooling channel and positioned within a mid-chord region of the airfoil. Nesting the pressure side serpentine cooling channel within the suction side serpentine cooling channel optimizes heat exchange between the cooling fluids and the materials forming the airfoil to reduce the amount of cooling fluids required, to reduce the required pressure of the cooling fluids, and to provide other benefits.",
        "The turbine airfoil may be formed by a generally elongated airfoil formed from an outer wall, a leading edge, a trailing edge, a pressure side, a suction side, a tip at a first end, a root coupled to the airfoil at an end generally opposite to the first end for supporting the airfoil and for coupling the airfoil to a disc, and at least one cavity in the elongated airfoil forming a cooling system in the airfoil.",
        "The cooling system may include a pressure side serpentine cooling channel and a suction side serpentine cooling channel. The pressure side serpentine cooling channel may be formed from a first outboard channel, a first inboard channel coupled to an outboard end of the first outboard channel and extending toward the root, and a second outboard channel coupled to an inboard end of the first inboard channel and extending toward the tip. The suction side serpentine cooling channel may be formed from a first outboard channel and a first inboard channel coupled to an outboard end of the first outboard channel and extending toward the root. The suction side serpentine cooling channel may also include a second outboard channel attached to an inboard end of the first inboard channel and extending toward the tip.",
        "The first outboard channel of the suction side serpentine cooling channel may be positioned between the second outboard channel of the pressure side serpentine cooling channel and the trailing edge of the airfoil. The first inboard channel of the suction side serpentine cooling channel may be positioned between the first inboard channel of the pressure side serpentine cooling channel and second outboard channel of the pressure side serpentine cooling channel. The second outboard channel of the suction side serpentine cooling channel may be positioned chordwise between the first inboard channel of the pressure side serpentine cooling channel and the first inboard channel of the suction side serpentine cooling channel. In an alternative embodiment, the first outboard and first inboard channels of the suction side serpentine cooling channel may be positioned between the first outboard channel and the first inboard channel of the pressure side serpentine cooling channel.",
        "The pressure side serpentine cooling channel may exhaust cooling fluids through film cooling orifices in the outer wall of the pressure side. The suction side serpentine cooling channel may exhaust cooling fluids through film cooling orifices in the outer wall of the suction side or an orifice extending between an outboard end of the second outboard channel of the suction side serpentine cooling channel and an outer surface of the tip, or both.",
        "The cooling system may include at least one leading edge cooling channel extending generally spanwise in close proximity to the leading edge of the elongated airfoil. A plurality of impingement orifices may be positioned in a rib positioned in the at least one leading edge cooling channel. A plurality of trip strips may protrude from inner surfaces of the at least one leading edge cooling channel, and the suction side and pressure side serpentine cooling channels. The cooling system may also include at least one trailing edge cooling chamber extending generally spanwise in close proximity to the trailing edge of the elongated airfoil. The trailing edge cooling chamber may include a plurality of impingement orifices positioned in a first spanwise rib in the at least one trailing edge cooling channel and a plurality of impingement orifices in a second spanwise rib positioned between the first spanwise rib and the trailing edge of the elongated airfoil. The impingement orifices in the second rib may be offset spanwise from the impingement orifices in the first rib. The trailing edge cooling channel may also include a plurality of trip strips protruding from inner surfaces of the at least one leading edge cooling channel, and the suction side and pressure side serpentine cooling channels.",
        "The cooling system may also include a cooling fluid supply chamber in the root of the elongated airfoil. An inboard end of the first outboard channel of the pressure side serpentine cooling channel and an inboard end of the first outboard channel of the suction side serpentine cooling channel may be coupled to the cooling fluid supply chamber. The cooling system may also include a central cooling fluid supply channel coupled to an inboard end of the first inboard channel of the pressure side serpentine cooling channel and an inboard end of the second outboard channel of the pressure side serpentine cooling channel. The central cooling fluid supply channel may separated from the cooling fluid supply channel by a plate that may or may not be removable.",
        "During use, cooling fluids may be passed into the cooling system in the turbine airfoil. In particular, the cooling fluids may be passed into the pressure side serpentine cooling channel and flow generally back and forth spanwise while flowing chordwise toward the trailing edge. A portion of the cooling fluids may also be passed into the suction side serpentine cooling channel that may pass cooling fluids back and forth spanwise while moving the fluids generally toward the leading edge. In this configuration, the cooling fluids move in a counter-flow relationship. It at least one embodiment, the pressure side and suction side serpentine cooling channels may extend from an inner surface of the pressure side to an inner surface of the suction side. The pressure side serpentine cooling channel may exhaust cooling fluids through the pressure side of the airfoil, and the suction side serpentine cooling channel may exhaust cooling fluids through the suction side of the airfoil.",
        "An advantage of this invention is that the pressure side serpentine cooling channel is tailored to account for the high temperatures encountered by the pressure side of the airfoil. By initiating the pressure side serpentine cooling channel proximate to the leading edge cooling channel, the pressure of cooling fluid supply may be reduced, which results in an overall reduction in cooling fluid leakage flow in the system.",
        "Another advantage of this invention is that the cooling system is formed from four independent cooling channels, the leading edge and trailing edge cooling channel, and the pressure side and suction side serpentine cooling channels, all of which may be individually tailored for their independent cooling requirements and aerodynamic pressure requirements.",
        "Yet another advantage is that having four independent cooling channels creates flexibility in the system to be adapted for different uses in the future.",
        "Another advantage of this invention is that the separation of the pressure side and suction side serpentine cooling channels eliminates conventional mid-chord cooling fluid flow mal-distribution due to film cooling flow mal-distribution, film cooling hole size, mainstream cooling fluid pressure variation, back-flow margin (BFM), and high blowing ratio for the blade suction side film cooling holes.",
        "Still another advantage of this invention is that the pressure side and suction side serpentine cooling channels eliminate the pressure differential that typically occurs in conventional cooling channel configurations between pressure and suction sides in a single channel.",
        "Another advantage of this invention is that the counter-flow of cooling fluid between the pressure side and suction side serpentine cooling channels yields a more uniform temperature distribution for the airfoil mid-chord section.",
        "These and other embodiments are described in more detail below.",

The cooling system 12 may be used in any turbine blade. The cooling system 12 may include a suction side serpentine cooling channel 16 nested within a pressure side serpentine cooling channel 14 and positioned within a mid-chord region 18 of the airfoil 10. Nesting the pressure side serpentine cooling channel 14 within the suction side serpentine cooling channel 16 optimizes heat exchange between the cooling fluids and the materials forming the airfoil 10, reduces the amount of cooling fluids required, reduces the required pressure of the cooling fluids, and provides other benefits.",

        "By configuring the pressure and suction side serpentine cooling channels 14, 16 in this manner, the cooling fluid flowing through the pressure side serpentine cooling channel 14 travels in a chordwise direction from the leading edge 34 toward the trailing edge 36. The cooling fluid flowing through the suction side serpentine cooling channel 16 travels in a chordwise direction from the trailing edge 36 to the leading edge 34. Thus, the cooling fluid flow through the pressure and suction side serpentine cooling channels 14, 16 is a counter-flow of cooling fluids between the pressure and suction side serpentine cooling channels 14, 16.",

        "During use, cooling fluids may be passed from the cooling fluid supply chamber 64 into the leading and trailing edge cooling channels 38, 40, the pressure side serpentine cooling channel 14, and the suction side serpentine cooling channel 16. The cooling fluids may enter the leading edge cooling channel 38, as shown in FIG. 3, pass through the impingement orifices 44, and impinge on the back surface 46 of the leading edge 34. The cooling fluids may then pass through exhaust orifice 52, as shown in FIG. 5, or film cooling orifice 54. Cooling fluids may also pass into the first outboard channel 66 of the pressure side serpentine cooling channel 14, through the first inboard channel 68, through the second outboard channel 70, and may be exhausted through film cooling orifices 54. The cooling fluids may flow generally toward the trailing edge 36. Cooling fluids may also pass into the first outboard channel 78 of the suction side serpentine cooling channel 16, through the first inboard channel 80, through the second outboard channel 82, and may be exhausted through film cooling orifices 54 and the exhaust orifice 88 in the tip 32. The cooling fluids may flow generally toward the leading edge 34 in the suction side serpentine cooling channel 16. The cooling fluids may enter the trailing edge cooling channel 40, pass through the impingement orifices 58, and be exhausted through the trailing edge exhaust orifices 62 or exhaust orifice 60 in the tip 32. The cooling fluids flowing in this manner flow counter to each other in the pressure and suction side cooling channels 14, 16.",
        "FIG. 6 displays the pressure profile 92 of the external hot gases and the pressures of the cooling fluids flowing through the pressure side serpentine cooling channel 14 and a suction profile 94 of the cooling fluids flowing through the suction side serpentine cooling channel 16. The graph displays how the invention customizes the pressures in the pressure and suction side serpentine cooling channels 14, 16 to maximize the cooling fluid flow efficiencies. The cooling system 12 is designed based on the mainstream gas pressure distribution. The pressure side serpentine cooling channel 14 begins proximate to the leading edge cooling channel 38, where the mainstream gas pressure is relatively high. The pressure of the cooling fluids in the pressure side cooling channel 14 is slightly greater than the outside gas pressure to create a positive outflow margin (OFM). Because the pressure side serpentine cooling channel 14 does not exhaust cooling fluids from the first outboard channel 66, the pressure of the cooling fluids in the first outboard channel 66 does not need to be as high as conventional pressures, which are about 10 percent greater than the mainstream gas pressure outside the turbine airfoil 10. Rather, the pressure of the cooling fluids in the first outboard channel 66 may be about three percent greater than the mainstream gas pressure outside the turbine airfoil 10. As the cooling fluids flow through sections of the pressure side serpentine cooling channel 14 downstream of the first outboard channel 66, such as the first inboard channel 68 and second outboard channel 70, the pressure of the cooling fluids is reduced due to resistance from turns and trips strips. However, the pressure of the mainstream gases outside of the turbine airfoil 10 are also reduced moving toward the trailing edge 36, and thus enables the second outboard channel 70 to have a back flow margin (BFM) of about 10 percent. In contrast, a conventional serpentine cooling must establish a much higher pressure gradient initially in the first outboard channel in order to maintain a proper BFM in the downstream cooling channels. Thus, conventional designs are less efficient than the instant invention.",
