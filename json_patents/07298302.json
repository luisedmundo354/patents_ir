SERDES modules are well-suited for effecting data transfers where circuit layout or other design considerations make provision of parallel data paths from point-to-point in a circuit impractical or undesirable. By way of example and not by way of limitation, SERDES circuitry may be advantageously employed in circuit paths traversing a flexible or exposed circuit juncture such as the hinge area connecting a flip cover and a main body of a mobile telephone, in circuit paths across a printed circuit board, or in other crowded or congested configurations where it is desirable to reduce the number of connecting structures between loci.",

        "A significant shortcoming of SERDES module 10 is that assuring time-incidence of signals presented at signal locus 50 with input signals received via low-speed data lines 40 requires operating control unit 30 at a high speed approximating operational speeds extant at high-speed side 13 of SERDES unit 12. Such a high speed of operation is disadvantageous, as may be manifested in SERDES module 10, by way of example and not by way of limitation, by higher power consumption, by increased difficulty in maintaining timing, by requiring more expensive parts for effecting higher speed technology and by more complex logic in the data path within SERDES unit 12.",
        "FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating a SERDES (serializer/deserializer) module configured according to the teaching of the present invention. In FIG. 2, a serializer/deserializer (SERDES) module 100 includes a SERDES unit 112 and a tri-state device 114. SERDES unit 112 has a low speed side 111 and a high-speed side 113. A timing source 116 provides a timing signal on a timing line 118. Timing source 116 may be embodied, by way of example and not by way of limitation, in a phase-locked loop (PLL) circuit. A multiplier 120 effects multiplication or speeding up of timing signals on line 118 to present high-speed clock signals to a high-speed clock input locus 123 at high-speed side 113 of SERDES unit 112 via a high-speed clock line 122. A divider 124 effects division or slowing down of timing signals from multiplier 120 to present low-speed clock signals to a low-speed clock input locus 127 at low-speed side 111 of SERDES unit 112 via a low-speed clock line 126.",

SERDES unit 112 presents a serial data signal at a serial data output locus 142 at high-speed side 113 of SERDES unit 112. It is preferred that serial output signals presented at serial data output locus 142 faithfully represent parallel input data signals received from parallel data lines 140 at low-speed side 111. Division by a factor N is indicated in FIG. 2 to indicate that division of timing signals from multiplier 120 may be effected variously. Factor N is customarily related to the number of data lines 140 so that factor N may be established as N=8 for SERDES module 100. Factor N may be assigned integer values according to expression [1] above.",

        "State machine 162 is coupled with divider 124 in parallel with SERDES unit 112 so that low-speed clock line 126 also provides a low-speed clock signal to state machine 162 via a low-speed clock line 164. As a result, state machine 162 and low-speed side 111 of SERDES unit 112 are driven by the same low speed clock signal. As a consequence, state machine 162 and low-speed side 111 of SERDES unit 112 are assured to operate synchronously.",
        "State machine 162 is controlled by a control unit 130. By way of example and not by way of limitation, control unit 130 is embodied in a digital microprocessor in FIG. 2.",
        "SERDES unit 112 receives data signals via low-speed parallel data lines 140 and presents a serial data signal at a serial data output locus 142 at high-speed side 113 of SERDES unit 112. It is preferred that serial output signals presented at serial data output locus 142 faithfully represent parallel input data signals received from parallel data lines 140 at low-speed side 111. Control unit 130 operates to cause state machine 162 to present control information via control signal lines 160 appropriately to present a control signal at a control signal output locus 144 at high-speed side 113. Serial data signals are received by tri-state device 114 from serial data output locus 142. Tri-state device 114 also receives control signals from control signal output locus 144. Tri-state device 114 effects a logical evaluation of received serial data signals and control signals and presents drive signals at a signal locus 150. A representative logical evaluation table appropriate for use by tri-state device 114 is described in connection with FIG. 3. Tri-state device 114 may, by way of example and not by way of limitation, present a \u201cDRIVE 1\u201d signal indicating a data element \u201c1\u201d, a \u201cDRIVE 0\u201d signal indicating a data element \u201c0\u201d or a \u201cZ\u201d signal. A Z signal may indicate a control operation from control unit 130 such as, by way of example and not by way of limitation, a mode in which SERDES unit 112 operates to receive signals from a remote device (not shown in FIG. 2) via signal locus 150 and a return path 148 to SERDES unit 112.",
        "An important feature of SERDES module 100 is that control unit 130 generates low-speed control signals via control signal lines 160 at low-speed side 111 of SERDES unit 112. Control signals on control signal lines 160 and data signals on data lines 140 are treated simultaneously by SERDES unit 112 using the same high-speed clock signals received at high-speed clock input locus 123 from high-speed clock line 122. That is, data signals (received via data lines 140) and control signals (received via control signal lines 160) are treated by SERDES unit 112 in lock-step using a common clocking signal (high-speed clock signals from high-speed clock locus 123). As a result, serialized data signals presented at serial data output locus 142 representing data received from data lines 140 are in synchrony with serialized control signals presented at control signal output locus 144 representing control signals received from control signal lines 160. Of importance is the result that control unit 130 is configured to effect generation of control signals for conveyance via control signal lines 160 at a low speed. It is not necessary to operate a control unit (e.g., control unit 30; FIG. 1) generate control signals at high speed as was required in SERDES module 10 (FIG. 1).",
        "Synchrony of data signals at serial data output locus 142 and control signal output locus 144 is assured in SERDES module 100 (FIG. 2), thereby assuring time-incidence of signals presented at signal locus 150 with input signals received via low-speed data lines 140 without operating control unit 130 at a high speed. Such low-speed of operation of control unit 130 contributes to avoiding disadvantages such as, by way of example and not by way of limitation, high power consumption, difficulty in maintaining timing, expensive parts for effecting higher speed technology and complex logic in the data path within SERDES unit 112.",
        "FIG. 3 is an illustration of a representative logic table for effecting logical evaluation by a tri-state device employed in the present invention.

Column 160 contains data presented at serial data output locus 142 (FIG. 2). Column 162 contains data presented at control signal output locus 144 (FIG. 2). Column 164 contains data presented at signal locus 150 (FIG. 2).",

As indicated by row 154, when data presented at serial data output locus 142 is a \u201c1\u201d and data presented at control signal output locus 144 is \u201c0\u201d, then data presented at signal locus 150 is a \u201cDRIVE 1\u201d signal. As indicated by row 156, when data presented at serial data output locus 142 is any value (represented by \u201cX\u201d in FIG. 3) and data presented at control signal output locus 144 is \u201c1\u201d, then data presented at signal locus 150 is a \u201cZ\u201d signal. Other logical relationships among data presented at loci 142, 144, 150 may be established to satisfy various operational requirements as desired, as will be understood by one skilled in the art of circuit design.",
