        "The present invention relates to a discharge electrode, for use in an electrostatic precipitator.",
        "Electrostatic precipitators are used, for instance to clean dust-laden gases deriving from different types of industrial plants, incinerating plants, and combustion plants.",
        "An electrostatic precipitator also includes so called collecting electrodes, in addition to discharge electrodes. A potential difference is created between the discharge electrodes and the collecting electrodes with the aid of a voltage source, so as to generate an electric field in an area between said electrodes through which the dust-laden gas passes, wherein the dust particles settle on the collecting electrodes, so that the gas will be essentially clean of dust as it exits from the precipitator.",
        "Preferably, D.C. voltage is used with the electrodes to obtain the greatest possible electric field strength at which a glow discharge or corona will be achieved, so as to obtain a maximum separation force on the individual dust particles and thereby achieve the best possible gas cleaning effect.",
        "It is desirable to design the electrode element of the discharge electrode so that the generation of a glow discharge or corona will be stimulated, corrosion will be minimized, and good mechanical stability will be obtained. The design of the electrode element will, conveniently, enable the discharge electrodes to be manufactured and handled in a reasonable manner. It is also desirable that the discharge electrodes will require minimal service and will be highly effective.",
        "An object of the present invention is to provide a discharge electrode with which these desiderata are achieved, said object being realized with a discharge electrode that has the characteristic features set forth in the accompanying claims.",
        "The discharge electrode includes a first tab or tongue bent outwardly from a wall of the tube of the discharge electrode, and a second tab or tongue substantially diametrically opposed to the first tab or tongue and bent inwardly from the wall of the tube. Preferably, the first tab or tongue, which comprises an electrode element, and the second tab or tongue, are punched from the wall of the tube in a single working operation",
        "The design and construction of the inventive discharge electrode is such as to impart thereto a high degree of efficiency and also an extremely good resistance to corrosion. The electrode is mechanically stable, simple to install and requires the minimum of maintenance. The discharge electrode affords both technical and economical advantages.",
        "The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to an exemplifying embodiment thereof and also with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which",
        "FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an inventive discharge electrode, and",
        "FIG. 2 is a longitudinally sectioned view of the electrode shown in FIG. 1.",
        "The illustrated discharge electrode 1 is constructed from a round tube 2 comprised of an electrically conductive material, for instance, of stainless steel or acid-proof steel, and includes a number of electrode elements or electrode tips 3 that have a corona stimulating function, among other things.",
        "The electrode elements 3 consist in tongues or tabs 4 bent out from the wall of the tube 2. The tongue 4 is punched from the wall 5 of the tube 2 and bent outwards in the manner shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. Since the tab/tongue 4 is bent outwards, the tongue is punched out from inside the tube by using a punch tool 20, meaning that a tab or tongue 6 will also be punched out on diametrically opposed sides of the tube, as will best be seen from FIG. 2. The tongue 6 is bent into the tube 2 and does not therefore constitute an outwardly projecting tongue.",
        "As illustrated in the Figures, the tongues 4 are bent up at their respective tips, so as to ensure that water droplets, e.g. condensation, will not land on the tips of the electrode elements and thereby jeopardize their efficacy. The configuration of the tongues 4 and the sharpness of their edges provide significant advantages from the aspect of corona generation. The configuration of the tongue 4 also minimizes the risk of dust build-up on the electrode elements 3, in accordance with the inventive concept.",
        "Because the tongues/tabs 4 are punched from the tube wall 5, an opening 7 will be left in the wall immediately beneath a respective tongue 4 and a similar opening 8 will be left in the wall 5 beneath the inwardly facing tongue 6.",
        "The discharge electrode 1 shown in FIG. 1 has a number of electrode elements 3 which point in four mutually different directions. It will be understood, however, that the number of electrode elements provided and their placement on the tube 2 may be varied as desired, in accordance with requirements. The cross-sectional shape of the tube 2 may also be different to that shown, and may, for example, be square instead of round.",
        "It will also be understood that structural modifications are possible within the concept of the invention.",
        "The invention is therefore not restricted to the illustrated and described embodiment thereof, since changes and modifications are possible within the scope of the accompanying claims."
