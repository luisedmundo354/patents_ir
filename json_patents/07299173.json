        "1. Technical Field",
        "The present invention relates to speech detection and, more particularly, relates to improved approaches to efficiently detect speech presence in a noisy environment by way of frequency and temporal considerations.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "In some applications, automatic speech recognition needs to be activated by uttering a particular word sequence such as keywords. For example, if a desktop personal computer has a speech recognizer for dictation or command control, it is desirable to activate the recognizer in the middle of the conversations in his or her office by uttering a keyword. This process of recognizing the keyword from continuous speech waveform is called keyword scanning. This would require the recognizer constantly recognizing the incoming speech and spotting those keywords. Nevertheless, the recognizer cannot be used to constantly monitor the incoming speech because it takes huge computational resources. Some other techniques that demand much less computations and memories have to be utilized to reduce the burden of speech recognizer. It is known that speech detection techniques are ways of eliminating silence segments from speech utterances so that speech recognizer can be speed up and do not wasting a lot of time on those silences or even misrecognize silence as speech. Speech detection techniques are often based on the speech waveform and utilize features such as short-time energy, zero crossing and etc. The same can be used to hypothesize keyword if some other features such as pitch, duration and voicing can be used in junction with word end-pointing techniques. Although the keyword hypothesis will be over generated, it still can reduce a large proportion of computations since the recognizer will only process these hypotheses.",
        "Most speech recognition applications today face the challenging task of segmenting speech based on voice, unvoice & silence detection. A conventional approach is detecting short-term energy and zero crossings of a speech signal. These approaches are not reliable for noisy telephone speech signals due, in part, to the greater noise in a background environment of most telephone conversations. For example, stationary noise such as motor or wind noise and non-stationary noise such as door openings, closing or respiratory exhalation are present in telephone speech.",
        "Accurate speech presence detection also conserves power and processing time for portable electronic devices such as cellular telephones. When reliable speech detection approaches are used, a speech recognition algorithm must find the utterances to determine if they are in fact language. This places a burden on computational complexity of processors and is a resource drain on portable electronic devices. A speech detection approach having computational efficiency as well as accuracy is needed.",
        "The inventors of the present invention have discovered that there is a high variance associated with voiced speech such as vowels and the low variance associated with silences and wide-band noise. Speech presence can be efficiently detected in a noisy environment by way of frequency and temporal considerations using this variance.",
        "Speech presence is detected by first bandpass filtering the speech to split it into banks of sub-bands. A matrix of shift registers secondly store each sub-band of speech. A power determining circuit then determines individual power measurements of the speech stored in each shift register element. A combining circuit combines the individual power measurements to provide a variance for the individual shift registers. A comparator circuit finally compares the variance with at least one threshold to indicate whether speech is detected. The present invention can be implemented by software in a microprocessor, digital signal processor or combinations with discrete components.",

A microphone 110 gathers speech often in a noisy environment. In amplifier and analog to digital converter 120 amplifies and conditions the electrical speech signal received by the microphone 110 and converts the electrical speech signal to digital speech sampled in time. In the preferred embodiment, the digital speech is sampled at preferably an 8 kHz sampling frequency and stored in frames preferably having a 10 millisecond duration. A preemphasis circuit 130 operates on the digital speech to equalize its power spectrum to make its frequency spectrum more flat. A digital signal processing emphasis of 1-0.9 Z\u22121 is preferred to equalize the input signal and derive a preemphasized output signal.",
        "Low band bandpass filter 141, mid band bandpass filter 143 and high band bandpass filter 145 split the preemphasized digital speech signal into a bank of preferably three sub-bands. Although a bank of three sub-bands is preferred, two or more sub-bands will work depending on the level of processing power and degree of detection accuracy needed for a noisy environment. It is preferred that the bandpass filters 141,143 and 145 divide the speech signal into somewhat equal sub-bands between 100 Hz and 3,000 Hz as follows. The low band bandpass filter 141 preferably has a band between 100 Hz and 1267 Hz, the mid and bandpass filter 143 preferably has a bandpass between 1267 Hz and 2433 Hz. The high band bandpass filter 145 preferably has a bandpass between 2433 Hz and 3600 Hz. Different band widths can be used for each sub-band.",
        "A matrix of shift registers 150 receives the three sub-bands from the bandpass filters 141, 143 and 145. The shift registers 150 store each of the sub-bands and shifted to a next register location for each frame. In the preferred embodiment a total of three frames are stored in the shift registers, thus creating a three-by-three matrix Yij consisting of matrix elements Y11, Y12, Y13, Y21, Y22, Y23, Y31, Y32 and Y33. This matrix stores the speech information by way of both frequency and temporal considerations. Each of the three-by-three matrix elements contains sub-registers 250 for storing multiple samples k within a frame. For each of the register memories of the shift registers 150, a power measurement Xij is derived from the contents of the sub-registers.

Alternatively, a variance combining circuit 160 can be performed calculations of the power measurements.",

A variance is a mathematical relationship known in digital speech processing as defined in elementary digital signal processing textbooks as such as Digital Communications, equations 1.1.65 or 1.1.66, by Proakis on page 17, published in 1989. The present invention applies a variance to a time-frequency power measurement to detect speech presence.",

When the variance is above the threshold, the presence of speech is detected, and a speech detection indication signal 180 is output. The threshold is preferably a fixed level however a variable threshold under certain conditions will yield more favorable results. A variable threshold can depend on determined by using an average of the past history of non-speech frames. Further, multiple thresholds can be implemented, one for clearly speech, one for clearly unspeech. A decision is made upon a transition over either of these thresholds.",
        "The presence of speech indicated by the speech detection indication signal 180 can be used to gate on and off a speech recognition unit. The detection of the presence of speech is useful to gate and off a speech recognition unit so that the speech recognition unit does not need to operate continuously. This saves processing time that can be used for other purposes and/or conserves power, which reduces battery consumption in a portable electronic device. When a speech recognition circuit is present in a portable electronic device such as a cellular telephone, battery savings are achieved by freeing up the processor for other functions when speech presence is accurately determined. Also, the speech presence detection circuit does not require full activation of a recognition code so its more efficient. Reduction of miss-recognition is also achieved when using better speech presence accuracy. The speech detection indications are also useful for other devices such as speaker phones.",

In step 330 to the speech is bandpass filtered into sub-bands. A power calculation is made in step 340 for the various samples over the various sub-bands. A power calculation is made in step 342 over the samples for the various sub-bands after delaying one frame in step 341. A power calculation is made in step 344 over the samples for the various sub-bands after delaying to frames in step 343. In step 350, a variance is calculated using the power calculations derived above over frequency and over time.
