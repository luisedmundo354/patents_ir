        "The present invention was developed with support from the U.S. government under Contract No. N00030-02-C-0011 with the U.S. Department of the Navy. Accordingly, the U.S. government has certain rights in the present invention.",
        "This application relates in general to fiber optic gyroscopes and, more specifically, to magnetic compensators for such gyroscopes.",
        "A fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) is a device used to sense rotation by detecting phase shift differences between two interfering, counter-propagating beams of light. As is well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art, FOGs exhibit bias offset errors in the presence of magnetic fields. These bias offset errors are caused by fiber twist, which occurs naturally and inevitably during the FOG manufacturing process.",
        "One common approach for reducing the influence of magnetic fields is to encase certain components of the FOG in a housing comprising magnetic shielding material, which is designed to protect sensitive components of the FOG from magnetic field effects. This approach, however, presents a number of drawbacks. For example, such magnetic shielding material increases both the weight and the cost of a FOG. In addition, it is typically infeasible to encase a FOG with sufficient shielding material to completely isolate sensitive components from the influence of ambient magnetic fields.",
        "Another approach for reducing the influence of magnetic fields is to add optical components, or compensators, to the FOG which are specifically designed to compensate for the bias offset errors experienced in the presence of ambient magnetic fields. This approach typically involves a complex and demanding fabrication process in which, first, the axial and tangential components of the overall magnetic sensitivity of a FOG are determined. Then, two discrete compensators are designed and fabricated to exactly match and cancel each of these components independently, i.e., a first compensator is designed and fabricated to cancel the axial magnetic sensitivity component, and a second compensator is designed and fabricated to cancel the tangential magnetic sensitivity component.",
        "This approach also presents a number of drawbacks. For example, the approach requires that each compensator be fabricated in accordance with extremely tight tolerances both for the magnitude and the orientation of its sensitivity. In addition, by using this approach, the assembly process for a FOG involves tight tolerances on the mechanical alignment of the compensators, both to assure cancellation of the sensitivity along the axis of the compensator and to avoid introducing sensitivity along the orthogonal axes. Given the tight tolerances associated with this approach, the result is a very labor-intensive and iterative process to continually adjust the sensitivities until an acceptable compensation level is achieved. Moreover, even using state-of-the-art fabrication techniques, there are limitations on the ability to fabricate compensators with specific sensitivities. As a result, the ultimate performance of such compensators is limited.",
        "The above-mentioned drawbacks associated with FOG magnetic compensators are addressed by embodiments of the present invention and will be understood by reading and studying the following specification.",
        "In one embodiment, a fiber optic gyroscope comprises a sensing coil having a magnetic sensitivity with a particular magnitude and a direction relative to the geometric axis of the sensing coil. The fiber optic gyroscope further comprises a first compensator having a magnetic sensitivity comparable in magnitude to that of the sensing coil and a second compensator having a magnetic sensitivity comparable in magnitude to that of the sensing coil and of the first compensator. The first compensator and the second compensator are positioned relative to one another and to the sensing coil such that the combined magnetic sensitivities of the compensators cancel the magnetic sensitivity of the sensing coil. Neither compensator must precisely match the axial or tangential components of the magnetic sensitivity of the sensing coil.",

The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.",
        "FIG. 1B illustrates components of a FOG in which conventional magnetic compensators and fabrication techniques are implemented. The components illustrated in the embodiment of FIG. 1B include a sensing coil 110, a transverse compensator 120, and an axial compensator 130. As is well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art, the sensing coil 110 exhibits a magnetic sensitivity, S, which characterizes the bias offset error experienced in the presence of ambient magnetic fields. The compensators 120, 130 are added to the optical circuit to passively cancel the magnetic sensitivity of the sensing coil 110. The optical circuit 180 is illustrated in the block diagram in FIG. 1B. Using the conventional magnetic compensators and methods illustrated in FIG. 1A, this magnetic sensitivity is decomposed into orthogonal vectors representing a tangential magnetic sensitivity component 140, labeled ST, and an axial magnetic sensitivity component 150, labeled SA, which are, respectively, perpendicular to and parallel to the geometric axis of the sensing coil 110.",
        "Unlike the sensing coil 110, the compensators 120, 130 preferably exhibit magnetic sensitivity in only one direction. Specifically, the transverse compensator 120 preferably exhibits only a tangential magnetic sensitivity 160, labeled CT, and virtually no axial magnetic sensitivity, whereas the axial compensator 130 preferably exhibits only an axial magnetic sensitivity 170, labeled CA, and virtually no tangential magnetic sensitivity.",
        "The magnitudes of ST and SA are determined after the sensing coil 110 is fabricated. Once these magnitudes have been determined, the transverse compensator 120 and axial compensator 130 are designed such that their magnetic sensitivities exactly match the sensitivity components of the sensing coil 110 they are intended to cancel. In other words, the transverse compensator 120 is designed such that the magnitude of CT exactly matches the magnitude of ST, and the axial compensator 130 is designed such that the magnitude of CA exactly matches the magnitude of SA.",
        "Once the compensators 120, 130 have been designed, they must be fabricated in conformance with exacting standards to satisfy extremely tight tolerances both for the magnitude and the orientation of CT and CA, respectively. Then, the sensing coil 110, transverse compensator 120, axial compensator 130, and other components of the FOG can be assembled using a variety of conventional techniques that are well-known and well-understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.",
        "Because the magnetic sensitivities of the compensators 120, 130 are affected by fiber twist, which occurs inevitably and cannot be controlled completely using currently-available fabrication techniques, at least slight deviations from the design values in CT and CA are bound to occur during the fabrication process. As a result, the fabrication of the compensators 120, 130 is typically an iterative process of measuring and adjusting the respective magnetic sensitivities of the compensators 120, 130 until an acceptable level of compensation is achieved. This time-consuming and labor-intensive process adds considerable cost and complexity to the overall FOG fabrication process. In addition, the inability to fabricate compensators with precisely-controlled magnetic sensitivities inherently limits the ultimate performance of such compensators. The systems and methods described below address these and other shortcomings associated with conventional magnetic compensators.",
        "FIG. 2A illustrates components of a FOG comprising magnetic compensators implemented in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In the illustrated embodiment, the components include a sensing coil 210, a first compensator 220, and a second compensator 230. The sensing coil 210 is conventional and can be designed and fabricated using a variety of well-known techniques. In some embodiments, the compensators 220, 230 comprise coiled and twisted lengths of optical fiber. The compensators 220, 230 are preferably optical devices comprising a suitable material, such as, for example, bismuth iron garnet, which has magnetic sensitivity due to the Faraday effect. This example is illustrated in FIG. 2B wherein compensators 221 and 231 are made of bismuth iron garnet.",
        "As discussed above, the sensing coil 210 exhibits a magnetic sensitivity 240, which characterizes the bias offset error experienced in the presence of ambient magnetic fields. The total magnetic sensitivity 240, S, can be decomposed into orthogonal vectors, SA and ST, which are parallel to and perpendicular to the geometric axis of the sensing coil 210, respectively. However, unlike the conventional approach described above, separate compensators are not designed and built to cancel the tangential and axial components of S independently (i.e., one compensator to cancel SA and another compensator to cancel ST). Rather, compensation is achieved by positioning the compensators 220, 230 relative to one another and to the sensing coil 210 such that the combination of their respective magnetic sensitivities 250, 260, labeled C1 and C2, passively cancels the overall magnetic sensitivity 240 of the sensing coil 210. This process can be modeled in vector space as a simple addition of all the vectors such that the sum of all sensitivities is zero.",
        "For example, FIG. 3 is a vector space representation of the magnetic sensitivity 240 (S) of the sensing coil 210 and the magnetic sensitivities 250, 260 (C1 and C2) of the compensators 220, 230. For simplicity, FIG. 3 illustrates the two-dimensional case in which S, C1, and C2 lie in a single plane. As illustrated in FIG. 3, angles \u03b81 and \u03b82 can be adjusted such that the vector sum of C1 and C2 create an overall compensator sensitivity 270, labeled C, which has the same magnitude as the sensitivity 240, S, of the sensing coil 210, but is oriented in the opposite direction.",
        "Mathematically, the vectors can be decomposed into the ordinal coordinates such that the following two equations can be defined:\n\nC1 cos(\u03b81)+C2 cos(\u03b82)+S=0\n\nC1 sin(\u03b81)+C2 sin(\u03b82)=0",
        "In these equations, C1, C2, and S are defined by the component sensitivities, while \u03b81 and \u03b82 are variables to be adjusted at the time of assembly. In the two-dimensional scenario illustrated in FIG. 3, there are two equations which need to be forced to zero, and there are two variables to be adjusted, \u03b81 and \u03b82. Therefore, as long as the magnitude of any one sensitivity, C1, C2, or S, is not larger than the sum of the other two, the equations can be forced to be equal to zero.",
        "This relationship enables the compensators 220, 230 to be designed and fabricated with considerably greater flexibility than previously available because, unlike conventional compensators, C1 and C2 do not need to fall within very tight margins to cancel S effectively. Rather, the compensators 220, 230 can perform their intended functions if the magnitudes of C1 and C2 are merely comparable to that of S. This increased flexibility advantageously enables the compensators 220, 230 to be produced in advance of characterization of the sensing coil rather than having to be individually designed, built, and calibrated for every individual sensing coil 210.",
        "In the three-dimensional case, illustrated in FIG. 2, an additional degree of freedom is added, which allows for the sum of the sensitivities in the third axis to be made equal to zero. Complete cancellation can still be achieved with only two compensators 220, 230, because no single compensator 220, 230 is required to cancel the magnetic sensitivity 240 of the sensing coil 210 in any particular direction. For example, in one embodiment, the sensing coil 210 and two compensators 220, 230 can be arranged in the configuration illustrated in FIG. 2. In other embodiments, alternative configurations can be implemented or more compensators can be utilized to achieve the same effect of complete cancellation of the magnetic sensitivity 240, S, of the sensing coil 210.",
        "While in the illustrated embodiment, both compensators 220, 230 have a large tangential sensitivity and small axial sensitivity, this is not necessary. In other embodiments, one or more compensators may have a large axial sensitivity and small tangential sensitivity, or a sensitivity comprising significant tangential and axial components. Angles \u03b11 and \u03b12 represent the orientation of the total sensitivity of each compensator 220, 230 with respect to its geometric axis.",
        "During assembly, the compensators 220, 230 can be rotated relative to one another and to the sensing coil 210 in a wide variety of ways. For example, in one embodiment, the first compensator 220 can be rotated about an axis parallel to the geometric axis of the sensing coil 210, as indicated by \u03b81; the second compensator 230 can be rotated about its own geometric axis, as indicated by \u03b83, and about an axis parallel to the geometric axis of the sensing coil 210, as indicated by \u03b82. In some embodiments, the angle \u03b13 between rotation axes \u03b82 and \u03b83 is non-zero and fixed, whereas in other embodiments, this angle may be adjustable.",
        "One exemplary method of positioning the compensators 220, 230 during the assembly process is described below. In this example, the compensators 220, 230 are arranged as illustrated in the embodiment of FIG. 2. First, the overall axial sensitivity is canceled by rotating the second compensator 230 such that \u03b83 is adjusted until the axial component of C2 cancels the sum of the axial components of S and C1. Mathematically, this step is described by the following equation:\n\nC1 cos(\u03b11)+C2 cos(\u03b12) cos(\u03b13)+C2 sin(\u03b12) sin(\u03b83) sin(\u03b13)+SA=0",
        "Following this step, \u03b83 is fixed. Then, the overall tangential sensitivity is canceled by adjusting \u03b81 and \u03b82 until the sum of all the tangential sensitivities equals zero, as described by the following two equations:\n\nC1 sin(\u03b11)sin(\u03b81)+C2 cos(\u03b12)sin(\u03b13)sin(\u03b82)+C2 sin(\u03b12)cos(\u03b83)cos(\u03b82)+C2 sin(\u03b12)sin(\u03b83)cos(\u03b13)sin(\u03b82)+ST=0\n\nC1 sin(\u03b11) cos(\u03b81)+C2 cos(\u03b12) sin(\u03b13) cos(\u03b82)+C2 sin(\u03b12) cos(\u03b83) sin(\u03b82)+C2 sin(\u03b12) sin(\u03b83) cos(\u03b13) cos(\u03b82)=0",
        "Although this exemplary method of positioning the compensators 220, 230 during the assembly process is an effective approach for canceling the magnetic sensitivity 240, S, of the sensing coil 210, there are many other methods that could be implemented in alternative embodiments.",
        "The magnetic compensators and FOG assembly techniques described above present a number of distinct advantages over traditional approaches. First, the compensators do not need to be built to match the sensitivity of the sensing coil to within very tight tolerances, as is required when using conventional compensators and techniques. Second, the compensators and methods described above result in relaxed requirements on the mechanical alignment of the compensators and the sensing coil within the FOG. Third, generic compensators with sensitivities comparable in magnitude to that expected of the sensing coil can be mass-produced in advance, and two such compensators can be arranged at the time of assembly to effectively cancel the magnetic sensitivity of the sensing coil.",
        "These magnetic compensators can perform their intended functions more effectively than traditional compensators because it is much easier to control the position and orientation of a compensator precisely and accurately than it is to control the exact magnitude of the compensator's magnetic sensitivity. Accordingly, using the compensators and methods described above dramatically increases flexibility in the design, fabrication, and assembly of magnetic compensators. This increased flexibility advantageously simplifies the overall FOG fabrication process, thereby significantly reducing both the time and the cost associated with the process and increasing yields.",
        "Although this invention has been described in terms of certain preferred embodiments, other embodiments that are apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, including embodiments that do not provide all of the features and advantages set forth herein, are also within the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention is defined only by reference to the appended claims and equivalents thereof."
