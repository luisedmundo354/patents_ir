        "The following co-owned and copending U.S. patent applications are incorporated herein by reference: ILLUMINATION ASSEMBLY AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME Ser. No. 11/018,608; ILLUMINATION ASSEMBLY AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME Ser. No. 11/018,605.",
        "The present disclosure generally relates to a lighting or illumination assembly. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a lighting or illumination assembly that uses an array of light emitting diodes (LEDs).",
        "Illumination assemblies are used in a variety of diverse applications. Traditional illumination assemblies have used lighting sources such as incandescent or fluorescent lights, for example. More recently, other types of light emitting elements, and light emitting diodes (LEDs) in particular, have been used in illumination assemblies. LEDs have the advantages of small size, long life, and low power consumption. These advantages of LEDs make them useful in many diverse applications.",
        "For many lighting applications, it is desirable to have one or more LEDs supply the required light intensity and/or distribution. For example, several LEDs can be assembled in an array having small dimensions to provide a high illuminance in a small area, or the LEDs can be distributed over a larger area to provide a broader and more uniform illuminance.",
        "LEDs in an array are commonly connected to each other and to other electrical systems by mounting the LEDs onto a printed circuit board substrate. LEDs may be populated onto a substrate using techniques that are common to other areas of electronics manufacturing, e.g., locating components onto circuit board traces, followed by bonding the components to the substrate using one of a number of known technologies, including wave soldering, reflow soldering, and attachment using conductive adhesives.",
        "Common LED packages used to hold LED die include one or more LEDS mounted in a ceramic or plastic package, with electrical connections provided through wires or solder bonds such as surface mounted packages or T-1 3/4-type \u201cjellybean\u201d packages, etc. However, these techniques and designs sometimes provide poor thermal conductivity from the LED package to a heat sink, and the circuitized substrates used can be expensive and sometimes provide poor light reflectivity.",
        "High thermal conductivity can be important for increasing the light output of an LED and extending its operating lifetime. Further, the reflectivity of the substrate can also be important in applications where the LED illuminates an optical cavity and a significant fraction of the light emitted by the LED reflects off the circuit substrate inside the optical cavity.",
        "The embodiments described herein are particularly useful for the manufacture and use of LED arrays that are utilized for lighting purposes or for information display.",
        "In one aspect, the present disclosure provides an illumination assembly that includes a thermally conductive substrate including a first major surface, and a reflective layer proximate the first major surface of the thermally conductive substrate. The assembly also includes a patterned conductive layer positioned between the reflective layer and the first major surface of the thermally conductive substrate and electrically isolated from the thermally conductive substrate, and at least one LED including a post that is attached to the thermally conductive substrate. The at least one LED is thermally connected to the thermally conductive substrate through the post and electrically connected to the patterned conductive layer.",
        "In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a method of making an illumination assembly, including providing a thermally conductive substrate including a first major surface, and positioning a patterned conductive layer proximate the first major surface of the thermally conductive substrate such that the patterned conductive layer is electrically isolated from the thermally conductive substrate. The method further includes positioning a reflective layer such that the patterned conductive layer is between the reflective layer and the first major surface, providing at least one LED including a post, and attaching the at least one LED to the thermally conductive substrate such that the at least one LED is adjacent the reflective layer. The at least one LED is thermally connected to the thermally conductive substrate through the post and electrically connected to the patterned conductive layer.",

The assembly includes a thermally conductive substrate including a first major surface, and a reflective layer proximate the first major surface of the thermally conductive substrate. The assembly further includes a patterned conductive layer positioned between the reflective layer and the first major surface of the thermally conductive substrate and electrically isolated from the thermally conductive substrate, and at least one LED including a post that is attached to the thermally conductive substrate.

        "The present disclosure is applicable to illumination assemblies, and is more particularly applicable to illumination assemblies that provide illumination using LEDs. The illumination assemblies disclosed herein may be used for general lighting purposes, e.g., to illuminate an area, or for providing information to a viewer by selective illumination of different areas of the assembly as in an information display. Such assemblies are suitable for use in backlight displays, signs, and other lighting applications that require a significant amount of light.",
        "The illumination assemblies of the present disclosure include an LED that is designed to be attachable to a substrate using a number suitable techniques, e.g., ultrasonic welding, press-fitting, piercing, screwing, etc. The substrates are thermally conductive such that heat can be conducted away from the LED. In some embodiments, the substrates are also electrically conductive, thereby providing a circuit pathway for the LED. Further, in some embodiments, the assemblies can include a reflective layer proximate a major surface of the substrate to reflect at least a portion of light emitted by the LED. Further, some embodiments include an LED having a post that can provide a direct thermal connection to the substrate. In an exemplary embodiment, this direct thermal connection can allow a portion of heat generated by the LED to be directed away from the LED and into the substrate in a direction substantially orthogonal to a major surface of the substrate, thereby reducing the amount of generated heat that is spread laterally away from the LED.",
        "FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-section view of one embodiment of an LED 20. The LED 20 includes a die 22 mounted within an LED body 24 that includes a reflective surface 25. The LED 20 also includes a first electrode 26 and a second electrode 28 that are both electrically connected to the die 22, and a post 30.",
        "As used herein, the terms \u201cLED\u201d and \u201clight emitting diode\u201d refer generally to light emitting semiconductor elements with contact areas for providing power to the diode. Different forms of inorganic semiconductor light emitting diodes may be formed, for example, from a combination of one or more Group III elements and of one or more Group V elements (III-V semiconductor). Examples of III-V semiconductor materials that can be used in an LED include nitrides, such as gallium nitride or indium gallium nitride, and phosphides, such as indium gallium phosphide. Other types of III-V materials can also be used, as can inorganic materials from other groups of the periodic table.",
        "The LEDs may be in packaged or non-packaged form, including, for example, LED dies, surface-mounted LEDs, chip-on-board LEDs and LEDs of other configurations. Chip-on-board (COB) refers to LED dies (i.e., unpackaged LEDs) mounted directly onto the circuit substrate. The term LED also includes LEDs packaged or associated with a phosphor where the phosphor converts light emitted from the LED to light at a different wavelength. Electrical connections to the LED can be made by wire bonding, tape automated bonding (TAB), or flip-chip bonding. The LEDs are schematically depicted in the illustrations, and can be unpackaged LED dies or packaged LEDs as described herein.",
        "LEDs can be top emitting, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,998,935 (Shimizu et al.). Alternatively, LEDs can be side-emitting, such as those described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0,233,665 A1 (West et al.).",
        "LEDs can be selected to emit at any desired wavelength, such as in the red, green, blue, ultraviolet, or infrared spectral regions. In an array of LEDs, the LEDs can each emit in the same spectral region, or can emit in different spectral regions. Different LEDs may be used to produce different colors where the color of light emitted from the light emitting element is selectable. Individual control of the different LEDs leads to the ability to control the color of the emitted light. In addition, if white light is desired, then a number of LEDs emitting light of different colors may be provided, whose combined effect is to emit light perceived by a viewer to be white. Another approach to producing white light is to use one or more LEDs that emit light at a relatively short wavelength and to convert the emitted light to white light using a phosphor wavelength converter. White light is light that stimulates the photoreceptors in the human eye to yield an appearance that an ordinary observer would consider \u201cwhite.\u201d Such white light may be biased to the red (commonly referred to as warm white light) or to the blue (commonly referred to as cool white light). Such light can have a color rendering index of up to 100.",
        "The LED 20 of FIG. 1 may include any suitable LED die 22. For example, the LED die 22 can include distinct p- and n-doped semiconductor layers, substrate layers, buffer layers, and superstrate layers. The primary emitting surface, bottom surface, and side surfaces of the LED die 22 are shown in a simple rectangular arrangement, but other known configurations are also contemplated, e.g., angled side surfaces forming, for example, a truncated pyramid shape that can either be upright or inverted. Electrical contacts to the LED die are also not shown for simplicity, but can be provided on any of the surfaces of the die as is known.",
        "Although the LED 20 is depicted as having one die 22, the LED 20 can include two or more dies 22, e.g., a red-emitting die, a green-emitting die, and a blue-emitting die.

For such active signs used in high ambient light conditions, low reflectivity at specific wavelengths may be tuned to the specific emission wavelength of the LED light sources so that the reflective layer is highly reflective at those wavelengths but absorptive over the broader spectrum, thereby providing an increase in light output while still reducing the amount of ambient light reflected by the layer.",

Ultrasonic welding is typically used to join multiple parts together using vibrations converted into heat energy. Common types of ultrasonic welding are plunge and continuous welding, for example, scan or rotary welding. In plunge welding, an ultrasonic horn plunges (travels towards the parts) and transmits vibrations into a top part. In continuous welding, the ultrasonic horn is typically stationary or rotating and the part is moved beneath it. Each of the ultrasonic welding types involves a horn.",

The welding portion has a cylindrical weld face having a diameter that expands and contracts with the application of vibration energy. Typically, a rotary horn is cylindrical and rotates about a longitudinal axis. The input vibration is in the axial direction and the output vibration is in the radial direction. The horn and anvil are close to each other, and the anvil can rotate in the opposite direction of the horn. The part (or parts) to be welded passes between the cylindrical surfaces at a linear velocity, equal to the tangential velocity of the cylindrical surfaces.

Solder typically has a lower thermal resistance than an adhesive, but not all LEDs have solderable base metallization. Solder attachment also has the advantage of LED self-alignment, due to the surface tension of the molten solder aligning the LED during processing. However, some LEDs may be sensitive to solder reflow temperatures, making an adhesive more appropriate. Lower temperature solders known in the art can be used for assemblies where good thermal conductivity is essential but conventional reflow temperatures of greater than 200\u00b0 C. cannot be tolerated.",

Further, the at least one LED 220 may be attached to the thermally conductive substrate 212 after the support layer 242, patterned conductive layer 250, and reflective layer 240 have been positioned proximate the first major surface 214 of the thermally conductive substrate 212.",
        "As mentioned herein, any suitable technique may be used to attach the LEDs of the present disclosure to the thermally conductive substrate. For example, an LED can include a post having a portion that is embedded in the thermally conductive substrate. For example, FIG. 4 is a schematic cross-section view of an illumination assembly 300. The assembly 300 includes a thermally conductive substrate 312, a reflective layer 340 proximate a first major surface 314 of the thermally conductive substrate 312, a patterned conductive layer 350 positioned between the reflective layer 340 and the first major surface 314, and at least one LED 320. The assembly 300 also includes a support layer 342 having a first major surface 344 and a second major surface 346 that is separated from the first major surface 314 of the thermally conductive substrate 312 by standoffs 316. The reflective layer 340 is positioned on the first major surface 344 of the support layer 342. Further, the patterned conductive layer 350 is positioned on the second major surface 346 of the support layer 342. All of the design considerations and possibilities described herein with respect to the thermally conductive substrate 212, the reflective layer 240, the patterned conductive layer 250, the support layer 242, and the at least one LED 220 of the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3 apply equally to the thermally conductive substrate 312, the reflective layer 340, the patterned conductive layer 350, the support layer 342, and the at least one LED 320 of the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4.",
        "The at least one LED 320 includes a post 330, an LED die 322, an LED body 324, and a reflective surface 325. The LED 320 also includes first and second electrodes 326, 328. At least a portion of the post 330 is embedded in the thermally conductive substrate 312. In some embodiments, the post 330 is embedded such that a first end 332 of the post 330 is located within the thermally conductive substrate 312. In other embodiments, the post 330 is embedded such that the first end 332 is outside of the second major surface 315 of the thermally conductive substrate 312 as is illustrated in the embodiment of FIG. 4. By embedding at least a portion of the post 330 into the thermally conductive substrate 312, the surface area of the post 330 that is in contact with the thermally conductive substrate 312 is greater than if the post 330 were only in contact with the first major surface 314 of the substrate 312. This increased contact can improve thermal conductivity.",
        "Further, the portion of the post 330 that extends beyond the second major surface 315 of the thermally conductive substrate 312 can provide additional heat dissipation into ambient air, forced air, liquid cooling, or other suitable heat dissipation techniques.",
        "The at least one LED 320 may be thermally connected to the thermally conductive substrate 312 through the post 330. Any suitable technique may be used to attach the LED 320 to the thermally conductive substrate 312. For example, an indentation or opening can be formed in the thermally conductive substrate 312, and the post 330 of the LED 320 press-fit into the indentation. The LED 320 remains attached to the thermally conductive substrate 312 by friction between the post 330 and the substrate 312. Any suitable technique may be used to form an indentation or opening in the substrate 312, e.g., knurling, embossing, etching, ablating, punching, etc.",
        "Alternatively, the at least one LED 320 can be attached to the substrate 312 by piercing the substrate 312 with the post 330 without first forming an indentation or hole in the substrate 312. To facilitate piercing of the substrate 312, the post 330 can include a pointed or sharpened first end 332.",
        "As mentioned herein, any suitable technique may be utilized to attach the LEDs of the present disclosure with the thermally conductive substrate. In some embodiments, the post without the LED body can be attached to the substrate and then the LED body can be attached to the post.",
        "In general, the LED 320 may be attached to the thermally conductive substrate 312 by first attaching the post 330 to the substrate 312 using any suitable technique, e.g., press-fitting, piercing, screwing, etc. If the reflective layer 340 includes aperture 348 and the support layer 342 includes aperture 349, then the post 330 is positioned in the apertures 348, 349 and brought into thermal connection with the substrate 312. In other embodiments, the apertures 348, 349 may be formed through the reflective layer 340 and support layer 342 during the attachment process as is further described herein. After the post 330 is attached to the substrate 312, the LED body 324 may be attached to the post 330 using any suitable technique. In one embodiment, the LED body 324 and the post 330 include threads such that the body 324 can be threaded onto the post 330 until the first electrode 326 and the second electrode 328 are electrically connected to the patterned conductive layer 350 through contacts 354. Alternatively, the LED body 324 can be friction-fit onto the post 330, or the LED body 324 can include retention protuberances or other devices known in the art for attachment.",
        "Any suitable device or technique can be used to prevent the LED 320 from becoming detached from the thermally conductive substrate 312. For example, the post 330 can include one or more protuberances to help fixedly attach the LED 320 to the substrate 312. In other embodiments, the post 330 can include one or more threads for threading or screwing the LED 320 into the thermally conductive substrate 312 as described in co-owned and copending U.S. patent application entitled ILLUMINATION ASSEMBLY AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME Ser. No. 11/018,605.",
        "In some embodiments, a support layer may not be required. For example, FIG. 5 is a schematic cross-section view of another embodiment of an illumination assembly 400. The assembly 400 includes a thermally conductive substrate 412, a reflective layer 440 positioned proximate a first major surface 414 of the thermally conductive substrate 412, a patterned conductive layer 450 positioned between the reflective layer 440 and the first major surface 414, and at least one LED 420. All of the design considerations in regard to the thermally conductive layer 212, the reflective layer 240, the patterned conductive layer 250, and the at least one LED 220 of the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3 apply equally to the thermally conductive layer 412, the reflective layer 440, the patterned conductive layer 450, and the at least one LED 220 of the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 5.",
        "In FIG. 5, the assembly 400 does not include a support layer (e.g., support layer 242 of FIG. 3). Instead, the reflective layer 440 is positioned on standoffs 416 that are positioned between the first major surface 414 of the thermally conductive layer 412 and the reflective layer 440. The reflective layer 440 may be laid on the standoffs 416, or the reflective layer 440 may be attached to the standoffs using, e.g., an adhesive. Any suitable reflective layer described herein may be used with the assembly 400 of FIG. 5.",
        "Further, unlike the embodiment of FIG. 3, the patterned conductive layer 450 is positioned on the first major surface 414 of the thermally conductive substrate 412. Those skilled in the art will understand that, to prevent the patterned conductive layer 450 from coming into electrical contact with the thermally conductive substrate 412, a dielectric layer may be required between the patterned conductive layer 450 and the thermally conductive substrate 412. Any suitable dielectric layer may be utilized. Further, any suitable technique may be used to form such a dielectric layer on the first major surface 414 of the thermally conductive substrate 412, e.g., chemical vapor deposition, sputtering, etc.",
        "The patterned conductive layer 450 may be any suitable type of conductive layer, e.g., patterned conductive layer 250 of FIG. 3. For example, the patterned conductive layer 450 can include a metallic mesh that is laid onto or attached to the first major surface 414 of the thermally conductive substrate 412.",
        "In some embodiments, for reflective layers that are nonconductive (i.e., dielectric layers), the standoffs 416 may not be required. Instead, a reflective dielectric layer 440 may be positioned directly on the patterned conductive layer 450.",
        "In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 5, the at least one LED 420 is electrically connected to the patterned conductive layer 450 through first and second electrodes 426, 428. Such electrodes 426, 428 are electrically connected to conductors 452 of the patterned conductive layer 450. Any suitable technique may be used to electrically connect the LED 420 with the patterned conductive layer 450. For example, the first and second electrodes 426, 428 may be ultrasonically bonded to conductors 452. Alternatively, the LED 420 may be attached to the thermally conductive substrate 412 such that the first and second electrodes 426, 428 remain in non-bonded electrical connection with conductors 452. In other embodiments, the first and second electrodes 426, 428 may be soldered to conductors 452.",
        "Any suitable LED or LEDs may be used with the assembly 400 of FIG. 5. For example, the assembly 400 can include an LED that includes a post a portion of which is embedded in the thermally conductive substrate 412 (e.g., LED 320 of FIG. 4). Such an LED may be attached to the thermally conductive substrate using any suitable technique, e.g., press-fitting, piercing, screwing, etc. Further, such a post may have a first end that extends beyond the second major surface 415 of the thermally conductive substrate 412 similar to the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4.",
        "The illumination assemblies of the present disclosure may be used in any suitable manner for providing illumination. For example, some or all of the illumination assemblies described herein may be used to provide illumination for displays. FIG. 6 schematically illustrates a display assembly 500 that includes an illumination assembly 510 optically coupled to a display device 520. The illumination assembly 510 may include any illumination assembly described herein, e.g., illumination assembly 200 of FIG. 3. The illumination assembly 510 provides illumination light to the display device 520. The display device 520 may be any suitable display device, e.g., electrochromatic or electrophoretic devices, spatial light modulator(s), transmissive signs, etc.",
        "For example, the display device 520 may include one or more spatial light modulators. In some embodiments, the one or more spatial light modulators may include an array of individually addressable controllable elements. Such spatial light modulators may include a suitable type of controllable element. For example, the spatial light modulator may include a variable-transmissivity type of display. In some embodiments, the spatial light modulator may include a liquid crystal display (LCD), which is an example of a transmission-type light modulator. In some embodiments, the spatial light modulator may include a deformable mirror device (DMD), which is an example of a reflection-type light modulator.",
        "The display device 520 may include any suitable optical and non-optical elements for producing a display image, e.g., lenses, diffusers, polarizers, filters, beam splitters, brightness enhancement films, etc. The illumination assembly 510 may be optically coupled to the display device 520 using any suitable technique known in the art.",
        "In some embodiments, the display device 520 may be directly lit by the illumination assembly 510 In other words, the display device 520 can be positioned between the illumination assembly 510 and a viewing position, e.g., those direct-lit displays described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0228106 (Stevenson et al.). In other embodiments, the display device 520 may be side-lit by the illumination assembly 510, i.e., light from the illumination assembly 510 is directed through one or more sides of the display device 520 that are substantially orthogonal to the output surface of the device 520. Such side-lit embodiments may include those systems described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0228106 (Stevenson et al.).",
