    "description": [
        "The present invention concerns to lead- and arsenic-free optical lanthanum flint glasses characterized by their optical position with a refraction power of 1.73\u2266nd\u22661.82 and an Abb\u00e9 value of 43\u2266Vd\u226653 as well as their use.",
        "The development of the market in the field of the so called \u201coptical data transfer\u201d trends increasingly to smaller devices which are still effective and which could consequently achieve more and more higher data transfer rates. This trend is also finding in the application fields imaging, digital projection, photo lithography, laser technology, wafer/chip technology as well as for the telecommunication, optical communication engineering and optical/illumination in the automotive sector.",
        "Further, in all sectors of this application field the traditional \u201cread only technology\u201d is more and more displaced by the \u201cread & write technologies\u201d. Therefore, the requirements on the optical systems and thus on the optical material are changing.",
        "While the \u201cread only technologies\u201d can be operated based on the separation in the two spatiotemporal strictly separated operating mode (writing and respectively reading) in the monochromatic mode and therefore the writing process could be carried out with light of the same wave length as well as the reading process, which could only carried out in the later operation, this is not possible for the \u201cread & write technologies\u201d. At this juncture, the wave length of the \u201cwriting jet\u201d has to diverge from the wave length of the \u201claser jet\u201d about at least 2-5 nm to lower values. Otherwise, not both modes in one optical head could be operated in the device. If a writing head and a reading head are necessary, this means that two different heads have to be combined in one device, and the technical effort as well as further the size and at least the costs of such devices would be unacceptable.",
        "The wavelength differentiation results from the necessity to separate the reading- and writing jet in the optical system to exclude important aberration by interference- and low light level effects. The lower the difference of both wavelengths can be kept while maintaining the necessary total separation, the easier such an optical system is realize. In this case, the term \u201ceasy\u201d concerns to the amount of the necessary optical components and therefore both, the minimal overall size of the module as well as the costs.",
        "However, the minimal wavelength difference as may be necessary for the complete division depends on the dispersion of the glass components in the optical system. The higher the dispersion (and therefore the lower the Abb\u00e9 coefficient), the further the both respective monochromatic jets are fan out and respectively broadened, till they finally interfere, which is contradictory to the aspired division. In reverse this means for glasses with this application intention: With diminishing dispersion, only low wavelength differences may be converted, which correspond to the aspired intention of a cheap product.",
        "Besides this improvement, a further improvement results from the low dispersion: It is possible to work with clearly lower wavelengths based on in principle identical wavelength differences in absolute terms. In general, the dispersion has a higher effect to rays with declining wavelengths.",
        "In addition to the disadvantage of the larger minimal wavelength difference of conventional glasses with a higher dispersion, also an undesirable increased absolute wavelength, as compared to low dispersive glass types, follows. A low absolute wavelength region of operation is favoured again in view of the application of the complete systems: The lower the operating wavelengths, the higher the achievable information packing density (relating to the unit of area of the data carrier material) are formed. In addition to the maximized information density, the access time is also optimized by shorter ways, namely reduced.",
        "Also, the refraction power position has an important influence to the practical property of such a complete system: The actual \u201cPick up lenses\u201d are defining with their refraction on power, both, the absolute wavelength region of operation of the combined write-read jets as well as the focal length of the system. As to the focal length, the interrelationship is as follows: The lower the focal length of such a system, the lower is there geometric dimension, which results directly in the component size and therefore massive in weight and costs. Therefore, a higher refraction power in the important wavelength range is desired.",
        "Besides, this is comparable for optical components of all above mentioned application areas. A further advantage of a high refraction power is the possibility to coat \u201cpick up lenses\u201d aspherical: The lower the transmission property of the glass at the operating wavelength, the poorer is the yield of the light in the system. The light intensity has a direct influence to the writing-reading quality of the systems. The poorer the yield of the light, the higher must be the efficiency of the light source, and due to this there are additional refrigerating sets necessary, resulting in costs and expenditure of unacceptable ranges.",
        "It is known, that high transmissions in the wavelengths working range of all optical systems are of particular importance. The lower the transmissivity of the glasses are at the working wavelengths, the more worst is the yield of the light of the system. However, the illuminance goes directly in the write-read quality of the systems. The more worst the illuminance, the higher the efficiency of the light source has to be, whereby the additional cooling units are required again, following in costs and expense in an unacceptable range.",
        "Additional to the optical values, also physical and chemical parameters are specified for glasses for the use in the above described application. These parameters are the low specific density and the good coating property, whereas these both conditions are leading to a restriction of the composition of the glasses to defined components.",
        "The specific density of the optical materials of these systems is very important. The \u201cpick up lenses\u201d as a component of the combined write-read head is movable elements of the system. The heads are moving for the actual data transfer above the data carrier. Therefore, the access times and the track densities are depending on the possibility of the fast and exact positioning of the heads. Thus, the higher the specific density of the glass building components, the higher is the mass of the mobile unit, which is then more inert and therefore slower in positioning. Due to this, the specific density of the glasses according to the present invention should be low.",
        "For many application areas, the reduction of the mobile mass of the glasses according to the present invention is very important. The \u201chandiness\u201d of lens systems, for example for photography, the projection and in future for the glass fiber technology and glass building component technology (e.g. for the use in the area of mobile optical computer like for example optical lap tops), is a important criteria.",
        "The aspherical coating of the Pick-Up lenses is organic chemical nature, like the common coatings of optical lenses and prisms. To obtain an adequate bonding of the optical layer on the basic glass, the glass material should contain components, which allow a strong bond to organic materials.",
        "Regarding to the aspect of materials procession concerning molten mass/hot forming, there is an increasing requirement for so called \u201cshort\u201d glasses, whereby these are glasses whose viscosity are variegating strong depending on temperature. This attitude shows the advantage during the process that the times for the hot forming; the \u201cform fit times\u201d could be shortened. Therefore, the throughput is increased and at the same time the forming material is treated with care, which has an extremely positive effect to the total production costs. Also, glasses with a stronger crystallisation gradient could be better processed since due to higher throughput a faster cooling down is possible. Therefore, problems are avoided, which occurs on \u201clonger\u201d glasses, like pre germination with following difficulties at the secondary hot forming.",
        "The prior art describes glasses, which cannot satisfy the above described requirements. In fact, these glasses are showing significant disadvantages:",
        "The Japanese Specification JP 08-059282 describes glasses of the lanthanum borate glass system with decreased processing temperature for the purpose of the precision hot forming, i.e. end-geometry-close hot forming in the primary hot forming step. Such glasses are not very stable in crystallization and have a viscosity with a strong dependency to the temperature. For this purpose the glasses of this document are containing alkali metal oxides (common fluxing agents) up to 12.5 w/w in sum, there under compulsory LiO2 wit up to 2.5 w/w. The application of these components effects the before mentioned decrease of the crystallisation stability in these glasses.",
        "DE 3102690 refers to lanthanum borate glasses containing high amounts of niobium with a high refraction power and a very low Abb\u00e9 coefficient at the same time, i.e. lanthanum heavy flint types. Similar glasses are described in the documents JP 56-160340 and JP 50-014712. If the borate contents (for the stabilization of the glass matrix) are too high for the desired refraction power position, high contents of expensive components have to be used, which is disadvantageous.",
        "According to DE 3102690, for the increase of the refraction power up to 8 w/w PbO are used, which is very harmful for health and environment.",
        "JP 61-012856 discloses glasses for photography with a high transmission in the UV-range. The glasses are related to the lanthanum borate glass system (La2O3 20-50 w/w; B2O3, 17-45 w/w) with compulsory fractions of tin oxide (up to 4 w/w) and ytterbium oxide (up to 35 w/w). Due to these components, the glasses are expected to be expensive.",
        "DE 1061976 describes glasses containing high amounts of lanthanum (La2O3 22.5-85 w/w) for achieving a high refractive index, but sets further value on a matrix containing high amounts of silica (SiO2 5-40 w/w) in addition to lanthanum realising borate (B2O3, 2.5-45 w/w). However, the silica leads to crystallization problems and the glasses do not at all fulfill present requirements of usability.",
        "The Japanese document JP 52-063211 concerns high dispersive lanthanum heavy flint glasses, which contain at least 2 percent by weight TiO2 with a maximum use of 19 percent by weight. In combination with an extremely unfavourable relation up to 26.5 of La2O3/B2O3, a very strong and undesirable potential of crystallization is generated.",
        "It is the object of the present invention to provide glasses which do not show the disadvantages of the glasses according to the prior art and do satisfy all the above mentioned requirements. Summarized, these are: high refractive index at low dispersion, a low specific density with simultaneously excellent transmission properties.",
        "The object is solved by glasses as described in the claims. The glasses according to the present invention show high Abbe values, corresponding to a low dispersion, still further high refractive indices (determined as nd) and a low specific density.",
        "According to a preferred embodiment, the glasses comprise small portions on tungsten oxide and show very good transmission properties in the visible light range, particularly for blue light and additional also a very good UV transmission. Further, the glasses according to the present invention are characterized by a good chemical resistance and workability, by satisfactory crystallization stability as well as a good environmental compatibility. The latter is achieved such, that the glasses do neither comprise PbO nor As2O3. Further, the glasses according to the present invention could ensure that organic materials are adhering excellent on the glasses, which is achieved by the addition of silica.",
        "A glass according to the present invention can be described by the following composition (in percent by weight (abbreviated hereinafter as \u201cw/w\u201d [weight/weight]) based on the oxides):",
        "TABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiO2\n0.1-5.5\n\n\n\nB2O3\n27-35\n\n\n\nLa2O3\n42-48\n\n\n\nBaO\n0-5\n\n\n\nZnO\n0.5-5\u2002\u2009\n\n\n\nY2O3\n\u20026-12\n\n\n\nTiO2\n0-4\n\n\n\nZrO2\n\u20024-10\n\n\n\nNb2O5\n0-5\n\n\n\nWO3\n0-5",
        "Additionally, they could comprise a common refine agent, and still further a maximum portion of 8 w/w alkali metal oxides (without Li2O) and in sum a maximum of 8 w/w (MgO+CaO+SrO). Arsenic refine agents are in this connection undesirable.",
        "The above shown glasses according to the present invention satisfy the requirements of good melting and processability properties at a refraction power of 1.73\u2266nd\u22661.82 and an Abb\u00e9 value of 43\u2266Vd\u226653, show a good chemical resistance and are stable to crystallization, while simultaneously the disadvantageous components PbO and As2O3 are absent.",
        "The above table shows that the glass system could be classified as a lanthanum borate glass. The borate provides the solubility of the lanthanum. For respective ratios of preferably La2O3 : B2O3 \u22661.8, stable glasses can be expected, particularly preferred are ratios of \u22661.6 and even more preferred ratios less than or equal to 1.5. At a ratio of La2O3 to B2O3 of 1.39, for an amount of 31 percent by weight of B2O3 only 43 percent by weight of La2O3 can be used. The required refraction power can be provided by the addition of ZrO2. Y2O3 can be used to decrease the tendency to crystallize. In addition, this glass system contains only low portions of the glass builder SiO2 (0.1-5.5 percent by weight, preferably 0.1-4.9 percent by weight, particularly preferred 0.5-4 percent by weight). This leads to an improvement of the workability by increasing the mechanical strength of the material. Therefore, good abrasion resistances and chemical resistances could be achieved in correlation to the used amount (e.g. AR=1). The addition of SiO2 should be restricted to the above shown maximum value.",
        "Alkalis are designated optional for specific adjustments in the light of the application field, such as for example ion exchange property, or slight variations of the behaviour of the viscosity depending upon temperature for the benefit of flexible, end-geometry-close hot forming, which can also be achieved by the optional use of the alkaline earth metal oxides MgO, CaO and SrO.",
        "An important component for achieving the special optical position with a high refraction power at a small Abbe coefficient is Y2O3 (6-12 w/w, preferably 7-11 w/w). Further, Y2O3 is stabilizing the silica containing lanthanum borate glass matrix.",
        "TiO2, which is limited to a maximum of 4 percent by weight, may cause in combination with the earth alkali metal oxides and ZnO (ZnO=0.5-5 w/w, preferably 0.5-4 w/w, particularly preferred 1-4 w/w; BaO: 0-5 w/w, preferably 0.1-3 w/w, particularly preferred 1-3 w/w; with \u03a3(MgO+CaO+SrO)=0-8 w/w and with \u03a3(MgO+ZnO)=0.5-10 w/w) the \u201cshortness\u201d of the glass. Preferred embodiments are free of TiO2.",
        "Mainly, the use of the earth alkali metal oxides is serving, in combination with TiO2, for the modification of the viscosity temperature profile. Due to the fact that these components also may influence the sensible optical position, MgO and CaO as deep refracting components are particularly limited (0-8 w/w, preferred variants are free of them). Therefore, the higher refracting components BaO (0-5 w/w, preferably 0.1-3 w/w, particularly preferred 1-3 w/w) and ZnO (0.5-5 w/w, preferably 0.5-4 w/w, particularly preferred 1-4 w/w) are preferred. Particularly preferred is ZnO since it has the character of a crystallization inhibitor.",
        "Nb2O5 is suited to inhibit crystallization by an antagonistic effect as to seed crystal content. Nb2O5 can be present in the formulations according to the invention in amounts of from 0 to 5 w/w, preferable 0.5 to 4 w/w, more preferred 1 to 4 w/w. Alternatively, the glasses contain no Nb2O5.",
        "The optionally used component WO3 is suited for the fine tuning of the optical position. In preferred embodiments, WO3 is present in amounts up to 5 w/w, more preferred from 0-3 w/w, still further preferred from 0.1 to 3 w/w and most preferred from 0.1 to 2 w/w.",
