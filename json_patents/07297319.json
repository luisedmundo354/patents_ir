        "The history of zeolites began with the discovery of stilbite in 1756 by the Swedish mineralogist A. Cronsted. Zeolite means \u201cboiling stone\u201d and refers to the frothy mass which can result when a zeolite is fused in a blowpipe. Volatile zeolitic water forms bubbles within the melt.",
        "Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates having as a fundamental unit a tetrahedral complex consisting of Si4+ and Al3+ in tetrahedral coordination with four oxygens. Those tetrahedral units of [SiO4] and [AlO4]\u2212 are linked to each other by shared oxygens and in this way they form three-dimensional networks. The building of such networks produces channels and cavities of molecular dimensions. Water molecules and charged compensating cations are found inside the channels and cavities of the zeolitic networks.",
        "Even though there was much knowledge about zeolites and its properties, it was until the middle of this century that commercial preparation and use of zeolites was possible. This advance allowed more research into the synthesis and modification of zeolitic materials.",
        "The modification of the physical-chemical properties of zeolitic molecular sieve by the incorporation of other elements different from silicon and aluminum can be achieved through one of the following ways:",
        "1.\u2014Incorporation through ion exchange",
        "2.\u2014Incorporation through impregnation",
        "3.\u2014Incorporation into the synthesis gel.",
        "The most common and well known form of introducing different elements in the channels and cavities of zeolitic molecular sieves is through ion exchanging. In this way, the compensating cation balancing the negative charge of the framework (usually sodium) is replaced by a new cation after ion exchange is done. In this case, the new cation is located inside the channels and cavities of the zeolite but, it is not coordinated with the silicon atoms throughout the oxygen atoms.",
        "The incorporation of other chemical elements in the zeolitic molecular sieve through impregnation is another common way of modifying the properties of zeolitic materials. For this case, most of the element incorporated in the zeolite is found in the surface of the crystallites of the zeolitic material.",
        "The incorporation into the synthesis gel of other chemical elements to produce zeolitic molecular sieves allowed an important advance in this area of research. This variation not only has modified the physical-chemical properties of the zeolitic materials of known structures, but also has given rise to the production of new structures unknown in the aluminosilicate frameworks.",
        "Patent and open literature have shown two important groups of zeolitic molecular sieve which incorporate other elements besides silicon and aluminum. These two main groups are the metallosilicates and the metalloaluminosphosphates. The metallosilicates are molecular sieves in which the aluminum is replaced by another element like gallium, iron, boron, titanium, zinc, etc. The metalloaluminophosphates are molecular sieves in which the aluminophosphate framework is modified by the incorporation of another element like magnesium, iron, cobalt, zinc, etc.",
        "Because the present invention is more related to metallosilicates than to metalloaluminophosphates, the metallosilicates are discussed in more detail. To choose an element to be incorporated into the molecular sieve framework, researchers take into account the possibility that the chosen element can attain tetrahedral coordination as well as the ionic ratio radius of such element. Table 1 shows the elements that can attain a tetrahedral coordination as well as the ionic ratio radius of such elements.",

In general, tetraalkylamonium compounds, tertiary and secondary amines, alcohols, ethers, and heterocyclic compounds are used as organic templates.",
        "All these known methods of producing metallosilicates have a series of serious disadvantages if it is desired to produce them in a commercial scale. For instance, those organic templates used are toxic and easily flammable so, since the synthesis must be carried out under hydrothermal conditions and a high pressure in autoclaves, an escape of these templates into the atmosphere can never be completely prevented. Also, the use of templates increases the cost of production of the material because the template is expensive and because the effluent from the production of the metallosilicate also contains toxic materials which require expensive and careful disposal in order to prevent contamination of the environment.",
        "Adding to this, the metallosilicate obtained has organic material inside the channels and cavities so, to be useful as a catalysts or adsorbent, this organic material must be removed from the lattice. The removal of the organic template is carried out by combustion at high temperatures. The removal of the template can cause damage to the lattice structure of the metallosilicate molecular sieve and thus diminish its catalytic and adsorption properties.",
        "The metalloaluminosilicate is another group of zeolitic molecular sieves that can be prepared, however, research in this area is not as popular as it is with the metalloaluminophosphates and metallosilicates. In spite of that, in the patent literature it is possible to find some examples of this type of materials. The preparation of iron- titano- and galloaluminosilicates can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,817; U.S. Pat. No. 5,098,687, U.S. Pat. No. 4,892,720; U.S. Pat. No. 5,233,097; U.S. Pat. No. 4,804,647; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,057,203. For those cases, the preparation of the material is by a post synthesis treatment. An aluminosilicate zeolite is put in contact with a slurry of a fluoro salt of titanium or/and iron or a gallium salt and then some of the aluminum is replaced by titanium, iron or gallium. This methodology has some disadvantages because of the extra steps required to produce the material.",
        "The ideal thing to do would be to add the desired element into the synthesis gel and then through a hydrothermal process get the metalloaluminosilicate material. In the patent literature is possible to find some examples of this type of procedure. U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,558 teaches the preparation and use of metalloaluminosilicates of the BEA topology with chromium, zinc, iron, cobalt, gallium, tin, nickel, lead, indium, copper and boron. U.S. Pat. No. 4,670,474 teaches the preparation of ferrimetallosilicates with aluminum, titanium, and manganese. U.S. Pat.

No. 5,354,719 teaches the preparation of metalloaluminosilicates of the MFI topology with gallium and chromium. These examples of metalloaluminosilicates require the use of organic templates or seeding procedures so, these methods of preparation of metalloaluminosilicates have similar problems to those described above for metallosilicate methods of preparation.",

        "The synthetic metalloaluminosilicates produced with this inventive method have physical and chemical characteristics which make them clearly distinguishable from other products. The methodology does not use organic templates or seeding procedures. The preparation method developed in the invention allows the incorporation in the synthesis gel of other elements of the periodic table and they are interacted with the source of silicon in an acid medium. In this way, the elements are incorporated in the material prepared and those elements are not ion-exchangeable when the final material is obtained.",

Examples of these are shown in Table 1. The amount of such elements present in the aluminosilicate framework of the present invention may vary depending on the required amount of such element in said material. Also, it is possible to mix more than two elements in a given material of the present invention. However, for all compositions of the present invention, it is a characteristic that at least some of the incorporated elements are not ion-exchangeable by conventional techniques and are present in the aluminosilicate material. The new compositions exhibit X-ray diffraction diagrams which contains certain definable minimum lattice distances. Furthermore, the new metalloaluminosilicate materials show specific absorption bands in the infrared spectrum. Also, the new materials show specific bands in the NMR spectrum analysis.",

Other techniques can be used in some specific cases like Mossbauer spectroscopy for iron, XPS for magnesium, etc.",
        "Infrared spectroscopy is a simple but powerful technique that can yield information concerning structural details of zeolitic materials. The region from 400 to 1500 cm\u22121 is important because in that region can be observed different sets of infrared vibrations related to zeolitic materials, for instance, the internal tetrahedral and external linkages. The infrared spectrum can be classified into two groups of vibrations: 1.\u2014internal vibrations of the framework TO4, which are insensitive to structural vibrations; and 2.\u2014vibrations related to the external linkage of the TO4 units in the structure. The latter are sensitive to structural variations. This technique has been employed to identify framework incorporation of other elements. Modifications and shift in the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations have been observed with successful incorporation of such new elements in the framework of the zeolitic material. For this reason this is an important characterization of the metalloaluminosilicate materials of the present invention.",
        "Another important characterization of the metalloaluminosilicates of the present invention is 29Si NMR spectroscopy. In silicate systems the Q-unit is used to indicate the different silicate atoms in a system. However, this notation is not sufficient to describe the basic building units in the zeolite or aluminosilicate frameworks. In the zeolite systems, the Q-units are always the Q4, where each silicate is surrounded by four silicate or aluminate units. Thus in zeolites, there are five possibilities, described by Q4 (nAl, ((4\u2212n)Si), where n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4.",
        "Generally these are noted as Si(nAl) or Si((4\u2212n)Si), indicating that each silicon atom is linked via the oxygen, to n aluminum and 4\u2212n silicon neighbors. Thus the silicon with four aluminum neighbors would be indicated by Si(4Al). When one or more Si atoms at the Q4 unit position are replaced by Al atoms, a shift in the 29Si chemical shift occurs.",
        "In the case of the metalloaluminosilicate of the present invention, besides Al atoms there are other atoms incorporated into the structure of the material, so the shift in the chemical shifts are due to them, because for a material with a given silicon to aluminum molar ratio the shifts due to aluminum are fixed, so the modification in the 29Si NMR chemical shift is caused by the other element incorporated in the structure which is linked to the silicon through the oxygen atoms.",
        "Mossbauer spectroscopy was used to confirm the incorporation of iron into the aluminosilicate framework of the ferrimetalloaluminosilicate material of Example 3 below. The Mossbauer spectra of this material showed a broad singlet at room temperature indicative of iron in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen.",
        "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is a technique that has been used in the characterization of the incorporation of magnesium into the framework of magnesoaluminophosphates (Zeolites 15: 583-590, 1995). When the magnesium is coordinated tetrahedrally with four oxygens as in the case of the magnesoaluminophosphate the value of the binding energy for the Mg2p signal is about 50.1 eV. For Example 20 below, this technique was used and the value of the binding energy of the signal Mg 2p was 49.8 which is close to the value found for magnesium in the magnesoaluminophosphate.",
        "The compositions of the present invention can be converted to protonic form, for example by ion exchange, with the help of a mineral acid, an ammonium compound, other proton suppliers, or with other cations. An important aspect of the invention is that the elements incorporated in the framework of the material are not ion-exchangeable, and therefore, they are not lost when ion exchange is done. The modified materials can be used in catalytic reactions as pure materials or in combination with other materials like clays, silicas, aluminas and other well known fillers.",

This composition is advantageously formed without the need for templating agents or seeding or other organic additives, and provides an aluminosilicate composition similar to ST5 which can advantageously be used for various catalytic applications. In this method, as with the method for preparing metalloaluminosilicates as discussed above, the sequence of first mixing silica source solution with acid or acid metal solution, followed by mixing with an alumina source solution to provide the desired gel mixture advantageously provides for formation of the desired aluminosilicate framework structure without the need for seeding or templating agents and, in the case of metalloaluminosilicates, advantageously incorporating the desired metal into the aluminosilicate framework.",
