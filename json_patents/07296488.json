    "abstract": "A system incorporating a robot to inspect ferrous surfaces. Preferably, the robot is an articulated device having a tractor module for motive power and steering, a power module for electrical power and communications and additional motive power, and a third module for cleaning and inspection. The robot uses sensors and generates and transmits signals to a computer through a tether and receives direction from an operator via the computer and tether. The computer continuously monitors the location of the robot and supports the robot during deployment. In a specific application, the robot travels the interior of a tank on a set of magnetized wheels. Prior to inspection, the tank surface is cleaned of deposits by rotary cutters and rotary brushes on the third module. The robot obtains thickness measurements via onboard ultrasonic transducers that contact the cleaned surface. A method for implementing inspection of ferrous surfaces is also described.",

        "Under 35 U.S.C \u00a7 121, this application claims the benefit of prior co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/553,613, now abandoned Apparatus That Accesses a Ferrous Surface That Is Inconvenient to Access in Order to Measure and Assess the Condition Thereof, by Hock et al., filed Apr. 20, 2000, and is incorporated herein by reference.",
        "In recent years, many tanks used for the underground storage of liquids have been made of fiber reinforced synthetic resins, and so will not rust or otherwise degrade over time. Traditionally, storage tanks were made of steel, thus these tanks can corrode to the point of perforation. Once corrosion has caused perforation, tank contents leak into the ground and gradually leach into nearby underground aquifers. Replacement or repair of these tanks to correct the damage involves extensive effort and attendant expense. In the United States, approximately 700,000 underground storage tanks are estimated to be in service. Most store petrochemicals. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) enforces regulations that protect against dangers inherent in defective underground storage tanks.",
        "40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 280 et seq. requires that new underground storage tanks (USTs) meet stringent standards and that all existing USTs be certified to be within specified tolerances for leak resistance integrity. Certification of existing tanks requires that the tanks in current service be inspected to determine whether they meet the applicable federal standard. Traditional methods for inspection of USTs require access into the tank by a worker to visually assess the surface. For a person to enter a UST, sometimes a portion of the earth covering a tank must be excavated and the stored liquid removed. Excavation is laborious and even after the liquid removal potentially toxic residual fumes remain in the tank, especially-in tanks storing petrochemicals.",
        "After an UST has been inspected and certified under 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7280 et seq., a cathodic protection system may be required to reduce subsequent tank corrosion, extend tank life, and comply with updated Federal standards.",
        "One example of a remotely controllable, self-propelled vehicle for inspecting the interior of USTs is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,435,405 to Schempf et al. The '405 patent describes a mobile vehicle having endless drive tracks that are selectively magnetically actuated during travel on the inner surfaces of a UST. As its endless drive tracks are driven in one direction, a clutch is intermittently engaged to cause a hollow shaft to rotate to intermittently activate a magnetic circuit. The vehicle is capable of climbing a vertical wall and traveling in an inverted orientation in a ferrous structure by utilization of its magnetic tracks. It is able to enter and operate in a tank that is filled with liquid and carries a camera and an ultrasonic tester. The vehicle has its basic components enclosed in a hermetically sealed and pressurized compartments to prevent explosion of the stored liquid and to keep the liquid from seeping into the electrical and mechanical parts. It is able to communicate signals indicative of its findings to an external computer.",
        "The '405 vehicle is equipped with acoustic means facilitating navigation within an enclosed structure containing a liquid. Calibration of the navigational system is necessary when operating in multiple fluid types since sound travels at different speeds in materials of different densities. While ultrasonic transducers used by the'405 vehicle facilitate measurement of wall thickness without determining a fixed point of reference, deployment of ultrasonic sensors alone to measure thickness to assess corrosive condition may be unreliable in an underground storage tank environment. Particular frequency readings may be affected by causes unrelated to wall thickness. For example, readings may be compromised by equipment operator produced sounds or vehicles traveling nearby. Another source of error may be unknown amounts of corrosive buildup on the tank surface. The'405 vehicle incorporates no means to remove accumulated rust or sediment before measuring wall thickness. Thus a need exists for a mobile device to travel within a liquid filled tank to measure and report actual tank wall thickness by performing the necessary tasks for making reliable measurements to include removing any corrosive buildup prior to measurement.",
        "Further, a need exists for the remote inspection of ferrous structures other than underground storage tanks. These other structures include bridges, building frames, utility towers and the like. Select embodiments of the present invention address such applications.",

        "FIG. 1 schematically illustrates a remotely controllable robotic vehicle 20 for inspecting and assessing the corrosive damage to an underground storage tank (UST) 10. The UST 10 comprises cylindrical wall 12, walls or end plates 14A and 14B, and a riser 16. The riser 16 is located at the top of the UST 10 and is adapted to receive liquid into the UST 10. As depicted in FIG. 1, the UST 10 and the robotic vehicle 20 are not drawn to scale for convenience of illustration. The robotic vehicle 20 is configured to enter the UST 10 through a riser 16 with a typical inside diameter of 10.2 cm. (4 inches), as further illustrated in FIG. 3A. The robotic vehicle 20 is specifically configured to enter through the riser 16 by having an elongate shape, by having its wheels tucked within the contours of its body, and by being formed in a substantially round cross section to optimize space utilization of the robotic vehicle 20. Alternatively, if the riser 16 is not of sufficient diameter, or not serviceable, for the robotic vehicle 20 to be deployed therethrough, entry would be through a manway (not shown separately) that may require excavation. Generally, it is not necessary to drain the liquid stored in the UST 10 since the components of the robotic vehicle 20 are sealed within one or more housings and the electrical power supplied through a tether 28 by a power source (not shown separately) is considered to be safe if provided at not more than 24 volts DC. In select embodiments of the present invention, the robotic vehicle 20 receives power from and communicates with a computer 100 through the tether 28. In select embodiments of the present invention, the tether 28 (shown and described in detail in connection with FIG. 10) includes power and communication wires and fluid transmitting tubes.

        "Refer to FIG. 1. In select embodiments of the present invention, to accommodate the need to traverse and inspect the interior surface of the UST 10, the robotic vehicle 20 is constructed in three pivotally connected and articulated modules 22, 24, 26, each adapted for a specialized function. The lead or forward module, hereafter identified as tractor 22, is attached to and followed by a power module 24. The power module 24 is connected to and followed by a cleaning and inspection module 26. In FIG. 1, the robotic vehicle 20 is shown in transition from the interior surface of a cylindrical wall 12 upwards onto the interior surface of an end plate 14A. Travel of the robotic vehicle 20 within the UST 10 is enabled by use of motor driven magnetic wheeled axle assemblies as shown in FIG. 8A.",
        "Refer to FIGS. 2A and 2B, showing the robotic vehicle 20 in side elevation and top plan views, respectively. As illustrated in FIGS. 2A and 2B, the robotic vehicle 20 may be deployed both vertically and horizontally. For example, the cleaning and inspection module 26 is designed to pivot in either an upward or downward direction only. The tractor module 22 is designed to pivot only laterally to the left or right. Since the robotic vehicle 20 is operative in various orientations, e.g., horizontal mode with wheels facing down, inverted horizontal mode with wheels facing up, and vertical mode as occurs on the end plates 14A, 14B; relative movement of the robotic vehicle 20 will be described from the perspective of the horizontal mode with wheels facing down unless otherwise noted. In the horizontal mode, the horizontal plane is referred to as the X-Z plane, and its two mutually orthogonal vertical planes are the X-Y and Z-Y planes. Sealing of the housing of the robotic vehicle 20 against leakage is accomplished by use of an RTV silicone compound between stationary parts and with O-rings for sealing shafts that move through housing walls. Once the housing of the robotic vehicle 20 is sealed, a pressurized gas, such as air or nitrogen, is introduced to the interior of the housing to prevent seepage of liquid into the housing. The tractor module 22 is flexibly assembled and connected to the power module 24 by a vertical front pivot joint 34 including a pin 84. This arrangement facilitates angular flexure between the tractor module 22 and the power module 24 only in the X-Z plane. The cleaning and inspection module 26 is assembled and connected to the power module 24 by a horizontal rear pivot joint 44. The rear pivot joint 44 enables angular flexure between the power module 24 and the cleaning and inspection module 26 only in the vertical planes X-Y and Z-Y.",
        "Refer to FIG. 2B illustrating the power module 24 as constructed with a forward segment 80, a middle segment 90, and a rear segment 96. In select embodiments of the present invention, electrically energized, reversible motors 92 and 110 drive various functions in the robotic vehicle 20. FIG. 2B shows the connections of these motors 92, 110 to tractor 22 and cleaning and inspecting module 26. The middle segment 90 contains the motor 110 that generates and transmits drive power to the front magnetized wheeled axle assembly 32. Power is transmitted from the motor 110 to the magnetized wheeled axle assembly 32 by means of a drive shaft 112. In select embodiments of the present invention, the drive shaft 112 includes a telescoping universal joint (not shown separately) at its transition to a drive mechanism housed in the tractor module 22. The forward end of the shaft 112 connects to a gear reducer 30 (see FIG. 3B) located in the tractor module 22. In select embodiments of the present invention, the gear reducer 30 drives the front magnetized wheeled axle assembly 32 through the chain 31 and the sprocket 70 depicted in FIG. 3B. In select embodiments of the present invention, the motor 92 (see FIG. 2B) and other electric apparatus in the body of the robotic vehicle 20 are powered at 24 volts DC. Use of DC power permits reversing the direction of drive without the added circuitry typically required with use of AC motors. In select embodiments of the present invention, small, reversible, high-speed electric motors are used in conjunction with worm and wheel type gear reducers (not shown separately) to conserve space. Typically, in select embodiments of the present invention, the worm and wheel type gear reducers are each immersed in an oil bath.

In select embodiments of the present invention, a shaft 40 is actuated to pivot the tractor module 22 laterally about pin 84 relative to the power module 24 to accomplish steering. In select embodiments of the present invention, the shaft 40 is moved linearly by a linear actuator (not shown separately) formed by the lead screw motor 106. In select embodiments of the present invention, the shaft 40 is configured to pass to the front end of the power module 24 and connect to the coupling 38 on the tractor module 22, thereby causing the tractor module 22 to change its direction of travel.",
        "The middle segment 90 of the power module 24 houses a reversible, electric motor 98 that supplies power through a worm and wheel gear reducer 102 (in the rear segment 96 ) to the rear magnetized wheeled axle assembly 42. Via the reducer 102, the rear magnetized wheeled axle assembly 42 is caused to rotate at the same speed and in the same direction as the forward magnetized wheel axle assembly 32. An incremental encoder (not shown separately) having a digital output communicates with the rear wheel drive motor 98 to obtain odometric data. In some applications of select embodiments of the present invention, a degree of slippage between the magnetized wheel asemblies 32, 42 and the surface of operation may occur, thus affecting the odometer reading. Thus, position verification may be accomplished by an operator (not shown separately) or by a computer 100 when the robotic vehicle 20 contacts a known fixed object, e.g., within the UST 10 this may be an end wall 14A, B. Thus, the occurrence of slippage does not preclude maintaining reasonably accurate real-time information regarding the position of the robotic vehicle 20. Another encoder (not shown separately), operable in a manner similar to that of the first encoder, may communicate with the drive for the front magnetized wheeled axle assembly 32, thereby improving reported positional accuracy.",
        "Refer to FIGS. 2B and 6. The motor 98 drives a shaft 108 that communicates with a gear reducer 133 that drives a sprocket 132 through a worm wheel (not shown separately) mounted on the pivot shaft 44. A chain 134 connects the drive sprocket 132 to drive the sprocket 136.",
        "Refer to FIGS. 2B, 3B, C, and 7. The sprocket 136 is mounted to provide power to the rotary cutters 124A, B and brushes 126 A, B of the cleaning and inspection module 26. The motor 92 is housed in the forward segment 80 for supplying linear power to the lead screw 93. The lead screw 93 operates linearly to contact and move the push rod 48, in turn, causing the transition lever arm 46 to pivot so as to lift the front end of the tractor module 22 as depicted in FIG. 3C. The lead screw 93 is aligned with the push rod 48 when the tractor module 22 is aligned with the power module 24.",
        "In summary, the drive motors are: the motor 92 to drive the front magnetized wheeled axle assembly 32; the motor 98 to drive the rear magnetized wheeled axle assembly 42 and the cutters 124A, B and brushes 126A, B of cleaning and inspection module 26; the motor 106 to drive the steering function of the tractor module 22; and the motor 110 to activate the lifting function of the transition lever arm 46 and the rear push rod 137.",
        "Refer to FIGS. 3A, B, C. The tractor module 22 includes the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 32 that is driven by a two-stage reduction drive. The front drive wheeled axle assembly 32 is mounted to the tractor module 22 far forward so as to protrude from the body of the tractor module 22 in a forward direction of travel. The front drive wheeled axle assembly 32 is also tucked within the substantially round body of the robotic vehicle 20 to limit the cross sectional size thereof to enable entry through a riser 16 as shown in FIG. 1. Typical risers have a diameter of four inches. As the front magnetized wheeled axle assembly 32 moves along the surface of the UST 10, loose particles of oxidized iron (rust) adhere to the contacting surfaces of the front magnetized wheeled axle assembly 32. Thus, in select embodiments of the present invention, a pair of scrapers 36A, B, preferably of a corrosion resistant material such as stainless steel, are mounted on the body of the tractor module 22 so that an edge of each presses against the cylindrical surface of the drive wheels 74A, B, 76 of the front magnetic wheeled axle assembly 32, dislodging particles that accumulate thereon. The scrapers 36A, B are mounted to permit dislodging when the robotic vehicle 20 is operating in either direction. As shown in FIG. 2B, the directional rod 40 that connects to the coupling 38 through the clevis 41 operates to turn the tractor module 22 in the plane of travel only. A shaft 40 communicates linearly with the power module 24 in a direction parallel to the long axis of the power module 24 to cause the tractor module 22 to pivot about the pivot joint 34. A coupling 38, preferably formed with a slot that is substantially perpendicular to the long axis of the tractor module 22, permits the shaft 40 to move without restriction.",
        "Refer to FIGS. 3A, B, C, depicting a pair of contact sensors, 50A, B mounted on the front left and right front corners of the tractor module 22. Each contact sensor 50A, B communicates with a contact switch (not shown separately), preferably digital, that generates a signal in response to the leading outer surface of either contact sensor 50A, B contacting something. The contact sensors 50A, B are mounted on the telescoping supports 52 configured to collapse into the tractor module 22 upon a corresponding sensor 50A, B contacting something. The degree of telescoping allows the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 32 to touch and magnetically grip a surface perpendicular to the surface on which the robotic vehicle 20 is traveling prior to contact. Contact by both sensors 50A, B simultaneously is interpreted by the computer 100 as a contact with a perpendicular surface. Contact by only one of the sensors 50A, B indicates a less than perpendicular relationship between robotic vehicle 20 and the contacted surface. In select embodiments of the present invention, maximum adhesive force for the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 32 is achieved by contact with the surface along a tangent across the face and parallel to the axis of the drive wheeled axle assembly 32. Thus, it is preferred that the tractor module 22 contacts the surface for transition, e.g., transition from a cylindrical wall 12 to and end plate 14A, perpendicularly. With the initial data from the contact sensors 50A, B as to the relative angle of contact of the tractor module 22, correction is made through program control by the computer 100 to achieve perpendicular approach. Attaining perpendicularity is accomplished by moving the robotic vehicle 20 backwards from the contacted surface and making additional approaches to achieve approximately simultaneous contact by sensors 50A, B.",
        "Refer FIGS. 3B, C. For the robotic vehicle 20 to perform a transition from one surface to another approximately perpendicularly disposed, it is necessary to first separate the drive wheeled axle assembly 32 from the current surface of travel. Separation is accomplished by actuation of the transition lever arm 46 pivotally mounted at the pivot 46. Alternate mechanisms, such as a linearly actuated push rod also accomplish this function. The transition lever arm 46 is L-shaped, with its upper end 46\u2032 positioned adjacent the forward end of the push rod 48. As the lead screw 93 (FIG. 4) pushes against the push rod 48, the push rod 48 moves left (FIG. 3C). The actuation of the push rod 48 from its retracted position (FIG. 3B) to its extended position (FIG. 3C) forces the transition lever arm 46 to pivot about the pin 46P counterclockwise as shown by the arrow K. The downward force of the transition lever arm 46 lifts the front of the tractor module 22 so as to separate the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 32 from the surface of the UST 10. When the push rod 48 retracts, the cam 46 pivots back to its initial position with the aid of a biasing means, such as a spring 49 or the like. The push rod 48 is slidingly mounted in bearings (not shown separately) in the wall of the tractor module 22 and not physically connected to the lead screw 93 (FIG. 4). When the tractor module 22 is at an angle to the power module 24, as in FIG. 2B, the push rod 48 is at a similar angle and not aligned with the lead screw 93. Thus, it is necessary to put the tractor module 22 and the power module 24 in substantial alignment prior to actuating the transition lever arm 46. As seen in FIG. 6, a solenoid-actuated push rod 137 is positioned to lift the rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 42 in a manner similar to the way that the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 32 is lifted.",
        "Refer to FIG. 8A illustrating the axial configuration of the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 32. The front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 32 is an assembly of five disk-like members 72, 74A, B, 76 interspersed axially along a shaft 78. The outer polar members 74A, B are located toward the ends of the shaft 78, respectively and the inner polar member 76 is centrally located along the shaft 78. The polar members 74A, B, 76 are made of magnetically transmissive material, not adapted to permanently retain significant magnetic properties, such as a low carbon steel. Between each of the outer polar members 74A, B and the inner polar member 76 is an axially polar magnetic member 72, each formed of a permanently magnetic material. In select embodiments of the present invention, the axial magnetic members 72 are formed of rare earth materials, e.g., neodymium iron, and oriented such that their poles are opposite to one another, as illustrated in FIG. 8B. In this arrangement, magnetic flux M is radiated between magnetic members 72 through polar members 74A, B, 76 to establish a strong magnetic bond between the robotic vehicle 20 and the ferrous surface upon which it operates. The shaft 78 passes through the five members 72, 74A, B, 76 and mounts the sprocket 70 to receive drive power from the chain 31. The rear drive wheeled axle assembly 42 is constructed similarly.",
        "Refer to FIG. 8A. Due to the irregular interior surface of a typical UST 10 and the frequent occurrence of lumps, select embodiments of the present invention employ a tread pattern to improve traction of the magnetized drive wheeled axle assemblies 32, 42. Multiple grooves 79 are formed on the outer periphery of each polar member 74A, B, 76 in a direction approximately parallel to the shaft 78. In one embodiment of the present invention there are six grooves 79 uniformly dispersed around each polar member 74A, B, 76. In select embodiments of the present invention, the grooves 79 may be aligned one to another across the face of the three polar members 74A,B, 76, although a non-aligned pattern is also suitable.",
        "Refer to FIGS. 8A, B. Each polar member 74A, B, 76 is formed with a relatively large diameter Dp and each magnetic member 72 with a relatively small diameter Dm. The pattern of magnetic flux M is shown schematically as dashed lines from each magnetic member 72 through respective polar members 74A, B, 76 to a ferrous surface such as the tank wall 12. This configuration enhances the flux pattern by causing it to intensify through the polar members 74A, B, 76. In addition, the large diameter polar members 74A, B, 76 protect the smaller diameter magnetic members 72 from damage due to wear or impact.",
        "Refer to FIGS. 9A, B. With diameter Dp of outer polar members 74A, B and the inner polar member 76 being substantially equal, all polar members 74A, B, 76 are in contact with the interior surfaces 12, 14A, B of the cylindrical UST 10 in only two relative orientations of the robotic vehicle 20. One orientation occurs when operating on planar tank end plates 14A, B and the other when operating circumferentially on the cylindrical wall 12. When the robotic vehicle 20 operates along a path parallel to the long axis of the UST 10 or on a path at an angle between a \u201cparallel axial\u201d path and a circumferential path, the inner polar member 76 does not contact the surface. The maximum air gap G is typically small between the inner polar member 76 and the surface. Magnetic flux M travels across the gap to attract to a ferrous surface. For example, in the case of the UST 10 having a diameter of 2.4 meters (8 feet), and the front drive polar members (wheels) 74A, B, 76 having a diameter of 5 cm (2 inches) and the length of the shaft 78 5.6 cm (2.2 inches), the maximum air gap G between the periphery of the inner polar member 76 and the tank wall 12 is approximately 0.33 mm (0.013 inches). Larger diameter tanks 10 have a proportionally smaller gap G. In select embodiments of the present invention, the magnetized drive wheeled axle assemblies 32, 42 produce a combined attractive force of 207 lbf. This is sufficient to support a robotic vehicle 20 of about 18 Kg (40 lbs).",
        "Refer to FIGS. 2A, B illustrating a robotic vehicle 20 in assembled condition including three main modules 22, 24, and 26. The power module 24 comprises a forward segment 80 (FIG. 4), a middle segment 90 (FIG. 5), and a rear segment 96 (FIG. 6). In select embodiments of the present invention, each segment 80, 90, 96 is built separately and assembled to the other segments so as to form the integrated power module 24.",
        "Refer to FIG. 4 illustrating the forward segment 80. In select embodiments of the present invention, the forward segment contains an orientation sensor 86 that comprises three mutually orthogonal piezoresistive inclinometers (not shown separately). This type of inclinometer has a flexible beam, typically silicon material, supporting a mass at one end of each inclinometer. Each inclinometer is sensitive along one axis only. As the orientation of the robotic vehicle 20 changes, the mass shifts in relation to the fixed end of the beam, causing the beam to bend. The silicon material changes in electrical resistance in proportion to strain, providing a property that can be readily measured and converted to an orientation reading. By feedback and analysis of signals received from each of the X, Y, and Z inclinometers, the computer 100 determines the yaw, pitch, and roll orientation of the robotic vehicle 20. Similarly, n select embodiments of the present invention, the computer 100 is able to detect a change in direction of the robotic vehicle 20 as it travels the interior of the UST 10.",
        "The transformation mathematics used to relate the inclinometer readings to angular orientation of the robotic vehicle simplify to the following:\n\n    Robotic vehicle roll angle=arctan (Y accelerometer reading/Z accelerometer reading).\n    Robotic vehicle pitch angle=arctan (X accelerometer reading/Z accelerometer reading).\n    Robotic vehicle yaw angle=arctan (Y accelerometer reading/X accelerometer reading).",

        "Refer to FIG. 5, illustrating the middle segment 90 of the power module 24. The middle segment 90 communicates with the computer 100 via the tether 28 and contains the motor 110 for generating drive power to the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 32. In addition, the middle segment 90 houses the motor 98 for steering the robotic vehicle 20 and the motor 106 for actuating the transition lever arm 46. On assembly, the middle segment 90 is fastened to the forward segment 80 and the rear segment 96 by appropriate fastening means (not shown separately) to become the power module 24.",
        "Refer to FIG. 6, depicting the rear segment 96 of the power module 24. The rear segment 96 comprises the shaft 108 that is connected at its driven end to the motor 98 (FIG. 5). The shaft 108 mounts the worm gear reducer 102 that, in turn, drives the rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 42 through a set of sprockets 105, 142, and 144 and chain 146. This permits the power module 24 to operate in the same direction and at the same speed as the tractor module 22. Although the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 32 is driven by a first motor 110 and the rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 42 by a second motor 98 the motors 98, 110 are controlled by the computer 100 to operate at the same speed. In select embodiments of the present invention, the motors 98, 110 are servomotors that enable maximum control of speed and direction. The scrapers 104A, B are each mounted with an edge pressed in contact with the rear magnetized drive wheels (not shown separately but of similar configuration to the polar members (wheels) 74A, B, 76 of the front wheeled axle assembly 32) to continuously remove rust particles from the peripheral surfaces thereof. The scrapers 104A, B are oriented in opposite directions so as to accommodate forward and reverse rotation of the rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 42. A pivot shaft 44 extends outwardly from each side of the segment 96 for pivotally connecting the cleaning and inspection module 26.",

        "In select embodiments of the present invention, the tether 28 is involved in the physical deployment into and retrieval of the robotic vehicle 20 from the UST 10; in supplying electric power to perform the motor drive operations, the ultrasonic inspection operation, and transmitting the orientation, travel, and communication signals; and in transmitting signals from the robotic vehicle 20 to the computer 100. In select embodiments of the present invention, the robotic vehicle 20 must drag a length of the tether 28 through the UST 10, at times involving support of its catenary weight as the robotic vehicle 20 traverses the \u201croof\u201d or end walls of the UST 10. The tether 28 is typically 45 m. (150 ft.) in length. Thus, it is important to keep the weight of the tether 28 at a minimum.",
        "In select embodiments of the present invention, the combination of the tractor module 22 and the power module 24 described above is operative for moving and controlling the movement of the robotic vehicle 20 within the UST 10 by implementation of signals from the computer 100.",
        "Refer to FIG. 7. In select embodiments of the present invention, the identification of defects in the walls of a UST 10 is facilitated by the cleaning and inspection module 26. As described above, the cleaning and inspection module 26 is pivotally connected to the power module 24 at the horizontal pivot pin 44 with a first bar 114 pivotally mounted on either side thereof. The rear portion of each bar 114 is pivotally connected to module 26 at a rear pivot shaft 116, positioned toward the rear portion of cleaning and inspection module 26. The rear pivot shaft 116 mounts the fourth sprocket 136 and the third sprocket 132 involved in the transmission of power for the cleaning and inspection module 26. A pair of telescoping pressurized struts 118, mounted to the shaft 115 at the back ends of the struts 118 and to the power module 24 (FIG. 6) at the front ends of the struts 118, prevents the cleaning and inspection module from moving horizontally while limiting the degree to which the cleaning and inspection module 26 can pivot vertically in relation to the power module 24. In select embodiments of the present invention, the struts 118 are of the telescoping cylinder type and are filled with nitrogen or other substantially inert gas. In select embodiments of the present invention, a supply of pressurized gas (not shown separately) may be connected to the struts 118.",
        "In select embodiments of the present invention as designed above, the cleaning and inspection module 26 is held in contact with the surface on which the robotic vehicle 20 is traveling, regardless of the orientation of the robotic vehicle 20. The stop 120 mounted rigidly to the side of the cleaning and inspection module 26 allows the forward end of the cleaning and inspection module 26 to pivot down to a limited degree with respect to the first bars 114. The tension springs 121 are assembled between the shaft 115 and a selected anchor point 117 on the housing of the cleaning and inspection module 26 to bias the module 26 in the counterclockwise direction in relation to an anchor point 117. This bias pressure, in combination with the operation of the struts 118, assures that the cleaning and inspection module 26 stays in intimate contact with the surface regardless of the orientation of the robotic vehicle 20.",
        "In select embodiments of the present invention, the cleaning and inspection module 26 includes devices for scraping residue off the surface to be inspected. Power is transmitted to the cleaning and inspection module 26 from the third sprocket 132 on the power module 24 via the second chain 134 that is connected at its rear end to the fourth sprocket 136. For the second chain 134 to connect between the pivotally connected power 24 and inspection and cleaning 26 modules, the chain engaging sprockets must be coaxial with the front 44 and rear 116 pivot points for the first bars 114. As illustrated in FIG. 7, the left (or front) end of the first bars 114 are assembled to the front pivot shaft 44 that is positioned in the rear segment 96 of the power module 26 (FIG. 6). In select embodiments of the present invention, the fourth sprocket 136 is commonly mounted with the fifth driving sprocket 122 that is connected to the duplicate cutting wheels 124A, B. The forward cutting wheel 124A and the rear cutting wheel 124B and duplicate rotary brushes 126A, B are connected to the fifth sprocket 122 through a third drive chain 128. The cutting wheels 124A, B are formed with a series of substantially sharp edges E spaced around the diameter thereof and extending across their widths. The cutting wheels 124A, B, especially the sharp edges thereof, are formed preferably of hardened steel or the like. The rotary brushes 126A, B are formed with a series of flexible bristles spaced around the diameter thereof and extending across their widths. In select embodiments of the present invention, the bristles of the brushes 126A, B are of polymeric material. In select embodiments of the present invention, the cutting wheels 124A, B are mounted at the forward and rearmost ends of the cleaning and inspection module 26 and the two rotary brushes 126A, B are mounted therebetween. As illustrated in FIG. 7, the cutting edges E of the forward cutting wheel 124A are angled to cut when the forward cutting wheel 124A rotates in the counterclockwise direction and the cutting edges E of the rear cutting wheel 124B are angled to cut in the clockwise direction. The fifth sprocket 122 drives the cutting wheels 124A, B and the rotary brushes 126A, B via the third drive chain 128.",
        "An idler sprocket 130 is positioned substantially in the center of the third drive chain 128 and is adapted for adjustment to provide chain tension as needed. The third drive chain 128 is entrained in serpentine fashion around a series of sprockets (not shown separately) to cause the forward cutting wheel 124A to rotate in a first direction and the rotary brush 126A to rotate in an opposite direction. The same counter rotation occurs with the rear cutting wheel 124B and the rotary brush 126B. In select embodiments of the present invention, the cutting wheels 124A, B are rotated at a speed about three times faster than the speed of the drive wheeled axle assemblies 32, 42 to effectively remove deposits. In select embodiments of the present invention, to assist the movement of the robotic vehicle 20, the cutting wheels 124A, B operate in the same rotational direction as the drive wheeled axle assemblies 32, 42, albeit faster.",
        "If a cutting wheel rotating in a direction opposite to the direction of travel were to encounter an obstacle such as a weld seam, a jam could occur. To avoid this type of jamming, in select embodiments of the present invention each cutting wheel 124A, B is driven by use of a unidirectional clutch (not shown separately) to enable rotation in the selected drive direction only. In select embodiments of the present invention, a first unidirectional clutch mounted to the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 32 permits rotation thereof only in the counterclockwise direction (FIG. 3B) and a second unidirectional clutch mounted to the rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 42 permits rotation thereof only in the clockwise direction. When the robotic vehicle 20 drives forward, with the tractor module 22 going first, the forward cutting wheel 124A and both rotary brushes 126A, B operate. When the robotic vehicle 20 reverses, i.e., with the tractor module 22 trailing, the motor 110 for driving the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 32 and the motor 98 for driving the rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 42 and the cutting wheels 124A, B are reversed, and the rear cutting wheel 124B and both rotary brushes 126A, B operate. By rotating the rotary brushes 126A, B in the direction opposite to their adjacent respective cutting wheels 124A, B, the particles loosened by the cutting wheels 124A, B are removed from the path of travel of the ultrasonic sensor unit.",
        "In select embodiments of the present invention, one or more ultrasonic transducers (not shown separately) are encapsulated in a block 60 preferably formed of a dense, tough, and resilient material, such as an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene resin. This block 60 is positioned between forward rotary brush 126A and rear rotary brush 126 B. The block 60 is biased downwardly to maintain firm contact with the operating surface for transmitting its sonic signal directly to the surface without having to broach an intervening gap. When the UST 10 is at least partially liquid filled, a lubricant layer exists between the block 60 and at least some of the tank's surface. In select embodiments of the present invention, when the tank is empty, ultrasonic transducer performance is enhanced and the wear on block 60 is minimized via use of a lubricating couplant liquid transmitted through the tube 281 in the tether 28 (FIG. 10). In select embodiments of the present invention, the ultrasonic transducers are 2-10 MHz pulse echo transducers, adapted for determining wall thickness when coupled with appropriate analytic computer programming therefor. In select embodiments of the present invention, several 10-Mhz ultrasonic transducers are arrayed in a scan path width of about 2.5 cm. (1 inch). In select embodiments of the present invention, ultrasonic data from the transducers are processed with a commercially available program such as that available from INFORMATRICS TESTPRO or the like. In select embodiments of the present invention, the cutting wheels 124A, B and rotary brushes 126A, B operate either in forward or reverse travel of the robotic vehicle 20 and engage the surface ahead of the transducers in the block 60. This ensures a reasonably clean surface for reliable measurements. In select embodiments of the present invention, the ultrasonic transducers may make between approximately 30 and 100 measurements per second. At a speed of approximately 77 mm (3 inches) per second, measurements may be collected about every 0.77-2.6 mm (0.03-0.10 inches).",
        "Refer to FIGS. 11A-11F depicting a robotic vehicle 20 as it progresses in sequential steps from a first surface of the cylindrical wall 12 of an UST 20 to a second surface of a wall or end plate 14A orthogonal thereto.",
        "Assume the robotic vehicle 20 is oriented substantially perpendicular to the surface to which it is transferring. Refer to FIG. 11A. Contact sensor 50B and 50A (not shown in FIGS. 11A-D) contacts the end plate 14A of the UST 10. FIG. 11B illustrates a second step in the transition of the robotic vehicle 20 from the cylindrical wall 12 to the end plate 14A in which the robotic vehicle 20 continues to travel and press a leading outer surface of the contact sensors 50A, B against end plate 14A whereby contact sensors 50A, B are telescoped to contact the body of the tractor module 22. A signal, generated by a contact switch (not shown separately) communicating with the contact sensors 50A, B, is transmitted to cause the transition lever arm 46 to pivot downwardly as shown in FIG. 11C. The transition lever arm 46 is pivoted downwardly by movement of the linear actuator 48 as described above. The transition lever arm 46 lifts the forward end of the tractor module 22 off the surface 12. The transition lever arm 46 being connected at the location of the pin 46P (FIGS. 3B, C) moves the robotic vehicle 20 closer to the end plate 14A during its pivoting action so that the front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 32 efficiently makes magnetic contact with the end plate 14A. During this transition period, the tractor module 22 is precluded from moving laterally with respect to the other two modules 24, 26. The connection between the cleaning and inspection module 26 and the power module 24 allows relative movement of these two modules 24, 26 in the vertical direction only as depicted in FIGS. 11C-E.",
        "Refer to FIGS. 11C-E. The front magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 32 powers the front end of the robotic vehicle 20 along the end plate 14A as the rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 42 continues to drive on the cylindrical wall 12, further assisting the robotic vehicle 20 to climb up the end plate 14A. In changing its orientation from horizontal to upwardly angled (FIG. 11D), the contact sensors 50A, B disengage from the end plate 14A and the transition lever arm 46 retracts within the housing of tractor module 22. The mid-point in the transition of the robotic vehicle 20 from the horizontal surface 12 to the vertical surface 14A is illustrated in FIG. 11E, with the robotic vehicle 20 forming a right angle between the power module 24 and the cleaning and inspection module 26. To accommodate the transition between the horizontal surface 12 and the vertical surface 14A, the drive wheeled axle assemblies 32 and 42 are mounted on the robotic vehicle 20 so that a respective forward and rearward portion of the peripheral surface of each wheeled axle assembly 32, 42 extends radially outward from the end of the respective modules 22, 24. The rear push rod 137 (FIG. 6) is positioned perpendicular to the horizontal surface 12. When the solenoid (not shown separately) of the push rod 137 is energized, the rear push rod 137 extends to move the rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 42 away from the horizontal surface 12 facilitating the rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 42 to climb the end plate 14A.",

In select embodiments of the present invention, the path for inspection of the end plates 14A, B is preferred to follow a series of diametral lines, each being angularly displaced from the previous one. Employing this pattern, the entire surface of each of the end plates 14A, B is inspected.",
        "Refer to FIGS. 12A-D. Obstacles encountered within a storage tank include raised seams, wave suppression plates, and internal ribs. FIGS. 12 A-D depict the robotic vehicle 20 navigating an obstacle. In select embodiments of the present invention, identification of an obstacle is based on a computer comparison of the known dimensions of an UST 10 with the distance the robotic vehicle 20 has traveled in a straight line since last contacting a perpendicular surface, such as a wall. In FIG. 12A, the contact sensor 50 B contacts the rib 54. As described above for transitioning to another plane of operation, the transition lever 46 is pivoted downwardly and lifts the front of the tractor module 22 up, as shown in FIG. 11C. As the tractor 22 proceeds forward, the front magnetized wheeled axle assembly 32 rolls up onto the rib 54 and the transition lever arm 46 retracts, as shown in FIG. 12B. As depicted in FIG. 12C, when the rear magnetized wheeled axle assembly 42 pushes the robotic vehicle 20, the front magnetized wheeled axel assembly 32 is rolled completely over the rib 54 and is able to roll on the horizontal surface 12 again. The rear magnetized drive wheeled axle assembly 42 continues to drive and to push the robotic vehicle 20 until it hits the rib 54 at which time the front drive wheeled axle assembly is able to assist in pulling the rear drive wheeled axle assembly over the rib 54. Normal driving resumes when both magnetized wheeled axle assemblies 32, 42 are again in contact with the horizontal surface 12 as shown in FIG. 12D, even though the inspection and cleaning module 26 is still being pulled over the rib 54.",
        "Upon initial insertion of the robotic vehicle 20 through the riser 16 into an UST 10, neither the position nor orientation of the robotic vehicle 20 is known to the computer 100. Thus, in select embodiments of the present invention, the robotic vehicle 20 is directed to maneuver through a series of preliminary runs for the purpose of initial orientation and position determination. The robotic vehicle 20 travels first in an arbitrary straight line. Signals generated by its three mutually orthogonal on-board inclinometers are monitored by the computer 100 to determine the shape and slope of the path being traversed. The robotic vehicle 20 is next directed to operate along a horizontal line. At one point, a contact sensor 50A, B on the tractor module 22 contacts a surface approximately perpendicular to the surface on which the robotic vehicle 20 is operating. The computer 100 combines the contact data with stored data on the direction of travel of the robotic vehicle 20 to establish position. Basic position and orientation information is now available for the robotic vehicle 20 to begin inspecting the interior of the UST 10 to evaluate its surface condition and transmit data for the computer 100 to create a record of defects. In select embodiments of the present invention, a preferred path is for the robotic vehicle 20 to travel forward along a first straight line on the cylindrical surface of the wall 12 until it contacts an end plate 14A, B, then reverse direction to travel backward to the opposite end plate 14A, B along a line that is substantially parallel to and slightly offset from the previous path. When the entire process of tank inspection has been completed, the robotic vehicle 20 is lifted from the UST 10 by the tether 28 to a position near the riser 16 through which it entered. In select embodiments of the present invention, the tether 28 is connected to the robotic vehicle 20 causing the back of the robotic vehicle 20 to tip up. The back of the robotic vehicle 20 is fitted with a retrieval bar (not shown separately) adapted for engaging by a retrieval hook (not shown separately) for removing the robotic vehicle 20 from the UST 10.",
        "Refer to FIG. 13 depicting a flat projected map of the interior surface of the UST 10. The map includes the unfurled surface of the cylindrical wall 12 and the end plates 14A, B, each divided by reference grid lines. In select embodiments of the present invention, the surface of the cylindrical wall 12 is marked by square grid lines and the surface of the end plates 14A, B by radial grid lines. The generation of these grids and plotting of the position of the robotic vehicle 20 thereon are accomplished through a mapping program loaded on the computer 100. For illustration, points locating defects of an UST 10 are marked with an \u201cX\u201d on the map of FIG. 13, whereas the present location of the robotic vehicle 20 is marked by a small circle.",
        "Refer to FIG. 14, a flow chart on the operation of the mapping function of select embodiments of the present invention. The location of the robotic vehicle 20 within a UST 10 is determined by combining a start position 160 with data obtained from the on-board inclinometers 162 and the encoder-odometer 164. These data provide a new position 166 that is marked 168 with a temporary designation, such as the \u201cX\u201d shown on the map of FIG. 13. Measurements of the wall thickness are generated constantly by the ultrasonic transducers in the block 60. The ultrasonic transducer wall measurement 172 is taken to derive a measured thickness 174 as an input to a determination 178 that compares the measurement 174 with a minimum thickness 176. If the measured thickness is below the minimum, the temporary position \u201cX\u201d is made permanent as a defect 170 for establishing in a record 180 of defect locations. Whether the measured thickness is below or within tolerance, it is added to the accumulating total (record) 180 of measurements taken. This enable a determination of percentage defects 182. A final test is a comparison 186 of the calculated percent defects with an established maximum percentage allowed 184, the results of which if positive invokes a request for repair 188, and if negative, a pass 190 with no required remediation.",
        "In select embodiments of the present invention, the robotic vehicle 20 may be manipulated autonomously by a computer 100 or by an operator controlling the robotic vehicle 20, or both. Operator control is preferable if the environment being traversed is unknown and potential risk indicates need for an informed immediate decision. In known environments, an automated program involving initial orientation of the robotic vehicle followed by a prescribed pattern of navigating is warranted. Programmed control of the robotic vehicle is most practical in cases of repeat inspections of known devices.",
        "Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined in the following claims. In the claims, means-plus-function clauses are intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents, but also equivalent structures. Thus, although a nail and a screw may not be structural equivalents in that a nail employs a cylindrical surface to secure wooden parts together, whereas a screw employs a helical surface, in the environment of fastening wooden parts, a nail and a screw may be equivalent structures.",
