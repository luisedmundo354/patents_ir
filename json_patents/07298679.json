A push-pull signal amplitude is obtained at two positions in a radial direction of an optical disk before writing. A linearization value of optimum write power associated with radial positions over the whole writing area of the disk is determined on the basis of the obtained push-pull signal amplitude. The determined result is adopted as optimum write power information associated with the radial positions of the disk.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a write power determining method and write power control method for an optical disk drive, which sets write power for writing.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Writable optical disk drives including a CD-R/RW drive, and a DVD-R/RW drive ensure the writing quality by the following control: OPC (Optimum Power control) which performs test writing of test data into a PCA area of an optical disk by use of various kinds of laser power, and then calculates laser power at which the reading quality such as a \u03b2 value becomes a target value; and ROPC (Running Optimum Power Control) which feedback controls laser power so that a B value indicating the quantity of return light after a write pit is formed is kept constant independent of the irregularity of coating on a recording film in an optical disk surface and also independent of the inclination of the optical disk.",
        "Because the ROPC performs the correction in a state in which various factors of the optical disk are mixed, it does not always achieve the optimization of the writing quality, and accordingly improvements are being tried in various ways.",
        "For example, the following technologies are known: the laser power control that keeps the ratio of fluctuations in quantity of return light to fluctuations in laser power (\u0394B/\u0394P) in the ROPC constant so as to keep a \u03b2 value constant irrespective of the inclination of the optical disk (for example, refer to patent document 1); the laser power control that keeps Bm/Pn constant (however, m<n) (for example, refer to patent document 2); and the like.",
        "In addition, the following example of the running OPC (for example, refer to patent document 3) is known. To be more specific, if a phase change recording optical disk such as a CD-RW is used, when overwrite is performed onto a written area, it is influenced by a state of prior writing, which makes it difficult to ensure the writing quality in the ROPC. Therefore, the influence of the overwrite is eliminated by the following steps: dividing a laser light beam into a main beam (zero-order diffracted light) and two subbeams (+1 order diffracted light and \u22121 order diffracted light); while irradiating a groove track with the main beam to perform writing, irradiating each land track adjacent to both sides of the groove track with the two subbeams; and performing power control of the main beam by use of return light of the land track that is not influenced by the overwriting.",
        "Moreover, in an optical disk drive, an optical pickup, which condenses a laser light beam and irradiates a track of an optical disk with a light spot to write information into the optical disk, is usually provided with divided light receiving elements which are disposed both in a track crossing direction of the light spot and in a direction orthogonal to the track crossing direction so that focus information and tracking information can be obtained from a detection signal coming from the divided light receiving elements.",
        "After that, a push-pull signal (PP signal) is obtained by the subtraction of a detection signal coming from the divided light receiving element in the track crossing direction of the light spot, which is one of the divided light receiving elements. In addition to it, a differential phase detection signal (DPD signal) is obtained by the phase comparison of the detection signals coming from the divided light receiving elements. The slope angle of the optical disk is then detected by both of the signals (for example, refer to patent document 4). This is the known technology.",
        "Patent document 1: Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2003-16645 (claim 1, 0023)",
        "Patent document 2: Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2003-248929 (claim 1, claim 3, 0024, 0026)",

        "Patent document 4: Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2001-307359 (claim 1, claim 2, 0023 through 0028, and the like)",
        "Year by year, shortening of the writing time is increasingly requested, and in addition to the speedup of writing, high-speed rotation of an optical disk is also pressingly requested. Under such circumstances, it becomes difficult to achieve the high accuracy of detection at the time when the ROPC detects the quantity of return light to ensure the writing quality.",
        "An object of the present invention is to provide a write power determining method of an optical disk drive, which can determine optimum write power information of an optical disk during the high-speed rotation of the optical disk.",
        "Another object of the present invention is to provide a write power control method of an optical disk drive, which controls laser power at the time of writing by use of the optimum write power information of the optical disk that has been determined beforehand.",

As regards the optimum write power information associated with the disk radial positions, if the optimum write power associated with an arbitrary outer circumferential measuring position relative to an inner circumferential reference measuring position is defined as PO, PO can be expressed as follows:\n\nPO=[1+{(PPI/PPO)\u22121}\u00d7PUP]\u00d7PI\u2003\u2003(Equation 1)\n\nor\n\nPO=[1+{1\u2212(PPO/PPI)}\u00d7PUP]\u00d7PI\u2003\u2003(Equation 2)",

        "In addition, the equation 2 is an equation of optimum write power PO with reference to an decreasing rate of PPO at an arbitrary outer circumferential measuring position associated with PPI at the inner circumferential reference measuring position or at a position in proximity to the inner circumferential reference measuring position.",
        "Incidentally, it is desirable to study in advance an optimum value of a ratio coefficient of power up based on a disk radius of the PUP on a medium basis.",
        "Moreover, it may also be so devised that the result of the study relating to the PUP on a medium basis is stored in the memory 10, and that the result of the study is read out from the memory 10 before the actual calculation.",

On the basis of the above-mentioned definitions, as shown in FIG. 5, if the disk radial distance r of the arbitrary outer circumferential non-measuring position and the optimum write power P at the arbitrary outer circumferential non-measuring position can approximate to a linear expression, the linear expression can be expressed as follows:\n\nP=(PI\u2212PO)/(ri\u2212ro)\u00d7r+(PO\u00d7ri\u2212PI\u00d7ro)/(ri\u2212ro)\u2003\u2003(Equation 3)",
