        "The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of grapevine referred to as grapevine \u201890-3437\u2019. When treated with Gibberellic Acid, this variety produces seedless fruit which are mature for commercial harvesting and shipment approximately October 1 to October 15 in the San Joaquin Valley of central California.",
        "The invention and development of new varieties of grapevines, as with other fruit producing varieties of plants, is a science marked by attentiveness, nurturing of the new varieties over lengthy periods of time, devotion to achieving the desired results and, in the end, good fortune. The variables associated with this process are countless and the results relative to the fruit produced, as to maturity date, size, quality, coloration, quantity and the like, may vary from growing season to growing season depending upon a multitude of influences. Variations in such influences may include, but are not limited to, seasonal variations such as temperature, rainfall, pests and diseases, as well as other factors which may be more reliably within control, such as the age of the plants, irrigation, pruning, fertilization, trellising practices and the like.",
        "Nonetheless, such invention and development continues and superior varieties of grapevines are discovered and developed as a result of the arduous tasks required. More specifically, with respect to grapevines, there continues to be significant effort to develop new varieties which are superior in one or more respects over existing commercial varieties. Such respects include, for example, relative to the fruit, productivity, size, coloration, flavor, shipping quality, as well as other characteristics. Still another characteristic is the maturity period of the fruit of the new variety. It is frequently deemed desirable in a new variety that the fruit matures during a period of time in which no other desirable variety matures, or which is superior in other respects to varieties which may mature at approximately the same time.",
        "The grapevine of the instant variety is a promising candidate for commercial success in respect to many of these criteria.",
        "The present variety of grapevine was bred under the direction of the inventor in 1989 in Delano, Calif., by cross pollination between the female parent grapevine \u2018Red Globe\u2019 (unpatented) and the male parent grapevine \u201826916\u2019 (unpatented). A single plant was chosen from this hybridization and named \u201890-3437\u2019. The present variety of grapevine was first asexually reproduced in 1990 in Delano, Calif. by grafting budwood of the new variety onto three-year old \u2018Salt Creek\u2019 woodstock. Subsequently, the resulting grapevines of the new variety were grown in the United States of America near Delano in the San Joaquin Valley of central California in a test plot. The observations and measurements hereof were made during the 1994 through 1999 growing seasons, at the same location near Delano in the San Joaquin Valley of central California. Grapevine \u201890-3437\u2019 has been found to retain its distinctive characteristics through successive asexual propagations.",
        "The new grapevine of the subject invention is characterized by its productivity producing large, seedless, light red-fleshed grapes which ripen for commercial harvesting and shipment approximately the same time as \u2018Emperor\u2019 (unpatented), or normally approximately October 1 to October 15 in the San Joaquin Valley of central California. The new variety may be compared in certain respects with \u2018Emperor\u2019. Grapevine \u201890-3437\u2019 is a seedless grape, while grapevine \u2018Emperor\u2019 has a seeded grape. Additionally, grapevine \u201890-3437\u2019 produces larger berries and is darker in skin coloration than \u2018Emperor\u2019.",
        "Grapevine \u201890-3437\u2019 differs from the female grapevine parent \u2018Red Globe\u2019 (unpatented) in that grapevine \u201890-3437\u2019 has seedless grapes, while \u2018Red Globe\u2019 has seeded grapes.",
        "Grapevine \u201890-3437\u2019 differs from the male grapevine parent \u201826916\u2019 (unpatented) in that grapevine \u201890-3437\u2019 has seedless light red-fleshed bright purple to dark purple-skinned grapes, while \u201826916\u2019 has white-fleshed and seeded grapes.",
        "The accompanying drawing is a color photograph of representative portions of the new grapevine of the present invention including bunches of grapes, sectioned portions of individual berries thereof, typical foliage and segments of canes.",
        "The following descriptions have been observed under the ecological conditions prevailing near Delano in the San Joaquin Valley of central California. All major color code designations are by reference to the Dictionary of Color, by Maerz and Paul, First Edition, 1930 except for color references to the anthocyanin coloration of the immature tendrils and growing tips and the leaf mid-vein tinge, which employ the Munsell color charts for plant tissues by Kollmorgen Instruments Corporation, New Windsor, N.Y. Common color names are also occasionally employed.",

The bases of the upper leaf sinuses are variable, most frequently \u201cV\u201d shaped, but at times \u201cU\u201d shaped bases can be present.\n            Petiole.\u2014 Length \u2014 Varies from 14.2 cm (5.54 inches) to 19.4 cm (7.57 inches).\n            Petiole.\u2014Thickness \u2014 Ranges from 2.0 mm (0.08 inches) to 4.0 mm (0.16 inches), measured at mid-petiole.\n            Petiole.\u2014Color \u2014 Ranges from a pale green (17-G-5) to a pale green-yellow (17-D-3).\n            Petiole.\u2014Surface \u2014 Color \u2014 On mature leaves, the surface is often tinged with a purplish hue, most frequently at the distal end near the petiole juncture with the leaf blade base.

        "Maturity when described: Ripe for commercial harvesting and shipment in a normal growing season (approximately October 1 to October 15) near Delano in the central valley of California. The date of maturity is similar to that of the commercial variety \u2018Emperor\u2019.

Almost no shatter occurs at full maturity.\n        \n        \n    \n    \n    Secondary bunches: The secondary bunches are numerous. Berry shape is similar to the berries in the primary clusters. Berry size in the secondary clusters is smaller than that in the primaries. Color of the berries in the secondaries is darker than in the primaries and almost all berries are fully colored. Color ranges from a purple (6-J-5 Rubaiyat) to a darker (7-E-5 Mauverose). Secondary bunch form is irregular. Secondary bunches can range from 4 cm (1.56 inches) to 12 cm (4.68 inches) in width and from 7 cm (2.73 inches) to 14 cm (5.46 inches) in length. Berry counts vary substantially from just a few, six (6) to ten (10), up to thirty (30) berries or more.\n    Flesh:\n    \n        \n        \n            Flesh color.\u2014Variable, most frequently it is a combination of generally clear or translucent areas with colored areas. The translucent areas are often, but not always, near the stem end of the berry and the colored areas are often next to, or 2 mm (0.08 inches) to 4 mm (0.16 inches) under, the skin surface. The colored areas range from a light rose (3-E-2) to a darker rose (3-H-2).\n            Juice.\u2014Color \u2014 Usually clear, but at times it can become slightly pink at advanced berry maturity.\n            Juice production.\u2014Juicy.\n            Flavor.\u2014Sweet and mild with excellent balance.\n            Aroma.\u2014Bunch aroma is slight to lacking.\n            Texture.\u2014Very good.

        "Although the new variety of grapevine possesses the described characteristics noted above as a result of the growing conditions prevailing near in the central part of the San Joaquin Valley of California, it is to be understood that variations of the usual magnitude and characteristics incident to changes in growing conditions, irrigation, fertilization, pruning, pest control, climate variation and the like are to be expected."
