        "The present application claims priority from Japanese application P2004-163328 filed on Jun. 1, 2004, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.",
        "This invention relates to a crisis monitoring system. In particular, the invention relates to a system that judges whether a person is in trouble or not from his/her utterance.",
        "Molesters frequent in confined public spaces. In order to avoid being molested in an elevator, for instance, a person should stand by the operation panel of the elevator, and if a suspicious-looking person gets on the elevator, be watchful of this person's behavior, so he/she can stop the elevator with the use of the operation panel and escape as soon as he/she senses harm from this person.",
        "A crisis monitoring system has been proposed to deal with such situations (JP 2001-80833 A). According to this technique, an image pickup camera picks up an image of the interior of an elevator car, an image identifying unit identifies the image picked up by the camera, and a car interior state identifying unit identifies a state in the elevator car. An anomaly judging unit judges, from results provided by the image identifying unit and the car interior state identifying unit, whether there is a disturbance in the elevator car or not. When a disturbance is detected, an anomaly judging unit notifies the caretaker office of the building of the disturbance.",
        "Another technique that has been proposed obtains an acoustic wave issued from a preselected monitoring object as an acoustic signal, which is analyzed by an acoustic analyzing module of a sound recognition unit (JP 2002-133558 A). The results of the analysis are processed by a signal analyzing module to obtain analysis information on the target. When the obtained analysis information exceeds a given level, image signals and acoustic signals of the living quarters being recorded for monitoring are sent over the Internet to a monitoring device, which is set up in a remote place from the monitored space to play images and sounds of the monitored space.",
        "Still another related technique is a break-in notifying system in which sensors placed on doors to and from a house, steps of a staircase in the house, a carpet on the floor, and the like sense an intruder and transmit radio waves to a server (or a phone) in the house to notify the server of the break-in (JP 2004-48164 A). Receiving the radio waves, the server sends a break-in notification to a predetermined address via a communication line. The break-in notifying system enables a user away from his/her home to know of a break-in and to deal with it promptly.",
        "According to the conventional techniques, none of the techniques are helpful to a person trapped with a molester in a confined public space where is little room to move away from the molester, and the victim cannot expect to be heard by anyone if he/she yells for help. Further, it is difficult for the victim to escape from the scene. As the countermeasure, in the case of an elevator, there is no other method than to stand by the operation panel and other such method for avoiding harm from the molestation. Therefore, the only thing the victim of the molestation can do is to operate the operation panel or use the emergency call and wait for the elevator to stop.",
        "This invention has been made in view of the above, and it is therefore an object of this invention to provide a crisis monitoring system that detects a crisis by identifying a person's emotion from his/her utterance.",
        "A crisis monitoring system according to an embodiment of this invention to judge whether a person is in a crisis situation, includes an input unit to which an audio signal is inputted, a recording unit which records information necessary to judge a crisis situation, and a control unit which controls the input unit and the recording unit, and is characterized in that the recording unit records emotion attribute information, which includes a feature of a specific emotion in an audio signal, and characterized in that the control unit determines a person's emotion by comparing an audio signal inputted to the input unit with the emotion attribute information, and executes a predetermined emergency processing when it is judged that the determined emotion indicates a crisis situation.",
        "The embodiment of this invention can detect a crisis in a public space visited by many people by picking up a person's utterance which is made upon encountering a crisis and by analyzing his/her emotion, as opposed to monitoring specific users who desire to use such monitoring services.",
        "On the other hand, the embodiment of this invention can also monitor only users who desire crisis monitoring by using in combination a crisis monitoring equipment, which monitors the users to watch for a crisis, and a crisis monitoring terminal, which starts up monitoring by the crisis monitoring equipment.",

        "The crisis monitoring equipment 110 is an apparatus which watches for a crisis in a monitoring area upon receiving a monitoring starting signal from the crisis monitoring terminal 100, and is installed in a monitoring area (for example, elevators and like other public spaces). The crisis monitoring equipment 110 is composed of an input unit 111, a recording unit 112, a control unit 113, a communication unit 114 and an output unit 115.",
        "The input unit 111 is constituted of input devices such as a microphone through which a user's voice is inputted. The input unit 111 may also be equipped with a camera by which an image is inputted, and a touch panel, a keyboard or a mouse with which data is inputted.",

        "The communication unit 114 communicates with the crisis monitoring terminal 100 over radio (or by infrared rays). The communication unit 114 also communicates with a control center (omitted from the drawing) over a cable (e.g. a public switched telephone network or the Internet). The communication unit 114 may communicate with other external devices.",

        "When the crisis monitoring terminal 100 request to observe, the crisis monitoring equipment 110 monitors a monitoring area and analyzes a person's emotion from voice information received by the input unit 111. In the case where an angry shout or a scream is observed indicating a disturbance, the crisis monitoring equipment 110 judges that an abnormal situation has occurred (e.g., molestation or robbery) and the communication unit 114 sends alerts the control center.",
        "FIG. 2 is a flow chart of monitoring processing by the crisis monitoring equipment 110 according to the first embodiment.",
        "When the crisis monitoring equipment 110 is activated (step 201), the crisis monitoring equipment 110 first sends an inquiry signal at a given timing to perform terminal search processing, which is for finding out whether the crisis monitoring terminal 100 has entered a communicable area (the communicable area includes the monitoring area such as an elevator) or not (step 202).",
        "In step 203, When the crisis monitoring equipment 110 receives a response signal from the crisis monitoring terminal 100, the crisis monitoring equipment 110 judges that the crisis monitoring terminal 100 has entered the communicable area (the monitoring area). And then the crisis monitoring equipment 110 starts observation of the monitoring area (step 207).",
        "On the other hand, the crisis monitoring equipment 110 does not receives a response signal from the crisis monitoring terminal 100, the crisis monitoring equipment 110 records the present condition in the recording unit 112 (step 204). When the crisis monitoring equipment 110 does not receive response signal from the crisis monitoring terminal 100, it means that the crisis monitoring terminal 100 has not entered the communicable area yet, or that the crisis monitoring terminal 100 has moved out of the communicable area. Alternatively, it is when the user operates the crisis monitoring terminal 100 not to want monitoring that the crisis monitoring equipment 110 receives no response signal from the crisis monitoring terminal 100.",

The record in the condition database 300 may be sent as it is to the control center.",
        "Thereafter, the crisis monitoring equipment 110 judges, through termination judging processing, whether to conduct a further terminal search (step 205). In the case where the crisis monitoring equipment 110 is to stop operating (for example, when a command to stop observation is inputted), the crisis monitoring equipment 110 stops to search the terminals (step 206). On the other hand, in the case where the crisis monitoring equipment 110 is to continue operating, the process returns to the step 202 to continue searching for the terminal.",
        "Starting observation (step 207), the crisis monitoring equipment 110 executes emotion detection processing of FIG. 5 based on voice information which is inputted through the input unit 111, to thereby judge whether the user is in trouble (step 208).",
        "When it is judged that the user is not in any trouble, the crisis monitoring equipment 110 records the present condition in the condition database 300 (step 209). Then the processing returns to the step 202, where the crisis monitoring equipment 110 searches for the terminal.",
        "On the other hand, when it is judged that the user is in trouble, the crisis monitoring equipment 110 follows emergency response 311 set in the condition database 300 and executes an emergency processing such as alerting the control center (step 210).",
        "In emergency, the control unit 113 controls the respective units to execute predetermined processing.",
        "In particular, the control unit 113 controls the communication unit 114 to have the unit 114 alert the control center. It is preferable for the communication unit 114 to send, at the same time as the reporting, to the control center, the present condition recorded in the recording unit 112 and the user's personal information recorded in the personal information management table 900. The user's personal information is transmitted using known encoding processing such as public key encryption in order to prevent third parties from reading the personal information.",
        "The control unit 113 controls the output unit 115 to have the unit 115 play an audio or visual message saying that the control center is being alerted.",
        "The control unit 113 may control automatic running of the elevator. In particular, the control unit 113 controls the elevator that is in operation such that the elevator car stops and opens its doors to the closest floor, or the floor where the building manager's office is located, and controls the elevator that is not moving such that the elevator car remains unmoving and keeps its doors open.",
        "For automatic running of the elevator, the control unit 113 sends commands such as a halting command to an elevator controllers from the communication unit 114. Alternatively, the control unit 113 may send a command to automatically run the elevator from the communication unit 114 to an elevator controller that is located at an elevator control center or at a security company contracted to guard the building, thereby having the external elevator controller operate the elevator.",
        "Such automatic running of the elevator makes it possible to stop the elevator on a given floor and rescue a user in the elevator car when, for example, the user is unable to operate the elevator. In addition, the perpetrator is prevented from operating the elevator when the elevator is run automatically.",
        "Preferably, the emergency processing is varied from user to user to suit wills of individual users by recording the above-described control method in the personal information management table 900.",
        "The control method given in the above is merely an example, and other control methods can be employed to ensure the safety of users.",
        "As the emergency processing (step 210) is completed, the crisis monitoring equipment 110 records the present condition in the recording unit 112 to update the condition database 300 (step 211). The process then returns to the step 202, where the crisis monitoring equipment 110 searches for the crisis monitoring terminal 100.",
        "The crisis monitoring equipment 110 is set to constantly monitor the crisis monitoring terminal 100 once the crisis monitoring terminal 100 enters the communicable area. Alternatively, the crisis monitoring equipment 110 is set to automatically start monitoring when the user holding the crisis monitoring terminal 100 enters the communicable area in a specific time zone such as late at night. The crisis monitoring equipment 110 may also be set to start monitoring when a load sensor placed at where an elevator hoist cable is attached senses a weight heavier than the weight of the user. It is also possible to set the crisis monitoring equipment 110 in a manner that makes the crisis monitoring equipment 110 stop monitoring when a given period has elapsed after the crisis monitoring terminal 100 enters the communicable area. These settings may be combined with one another and various other settings are employable. What setting of the crisis monitoring equipment 110 a user prefers is set in advance in the personal information management table 900.",
        "Audio data inputted through the input unit 111 is preferably stored in the recording unit 112. The stored audio data can be used in identifying the person who has committed an offence against the user during observation. A camera may be employed to observe images. Images of the interior of the elevator car picked up by the camera are preferably stored in the recording unit 112, so that the stored images can be used in identifying a suspect.",
        "However, it is advisable to quickly delete audio, visual or other data stored in the recording unit 112 in the case where monitoring is ended without detecting any trouble, since the recorded data contains a lot of personal (private) information.",
        "FIG. 3 is a configuration diagram of the condition database 300.",
        "The condition database 300 is placed in the recording unit 112 of the crisis monitoring equipment 110.

        "A date 301 is a date when the user uses the system (in other words, when the user's condition is observed). A starting time 302 is a time the system is activated by an observation request from the crisis monitoring terminal 100. A closing time 303 is a time the system stops operating as the crisis monitoring terminal 100 moves out of the communicable area or from other reasons.",
        "A starting position 304 is a location where the system is activated by an observation request from the crisis monitoring terminal 100. A closing position 305 is a location where the system stops operating as the crisis monitoring terminal 100 moves out of the communicable area or from other reasons. In the example of FIG. 3, this particular user gets on the elevator on the first floor, gets off the elevator on the third floor, and then moves out of the monitoring area.",
        "An observation result 306 is the result of observation at step 207 in FIG. 2. A monitoring result 307 is the result of monitoring which is judged from the observation result 306, and whether condition is good or bad is recorded as the monitoring result 307.",
        "For instance, when it is judged that a user to be in trouble from an angry shout or a scream observed, \u201ctrouble\u201d is recorded as the monitoring result 307. On the other hand, when it is judged that nothing is out of ordinary in the monitoring area, \u201cnormal\u201d is recorded as the monitoring result 307. In the case where more than one type of observation is to be made (for example, sound observation and image observation), several types of data are recorded as the observation result 306 and judged in a comprehensive manner to produce the monitoring result 307.",
        "The object person 308 is the user who has activated the crisis monitoring equipment 110, that is the object of monitoring.",
        "The room number 309 is the number of the apartment where the object person 308 resides. In the case where this crisis monitoring system is installed in a public space instead of a housing complex or the like, the address of the object person is set in place of the room number 309. An emergency contact address 310 is where the user desires to have the system make a contact in emergencies. The address of next of kin of the object person 308 or the like is recorded as the emergency contact address 310.",
        "The emergency response 311 is what the user desires to have the system do in emergencies. It is not always necessary to newly set the emergency response 311 and the default setting such as calling to the control center may be employed. It is also possible to set different response for different monitoring areas (for example, inside the elevator or in the corridor). The emergency response 311 may also vary from user to user in accordance with the method recorded in the personal information management table 900. Other various settings can be employed for the emergency response 311.",
        "The room number 309, the emergency contact address 310, and the emergency response 311 are predetermined.",
        "Items to be recorded in the condition database 300 are not limited to those shown in FIG. 3, and an item can be removed or added as needed. Preferably, the condition database 300 holds a condition history as well as the present condition by accumulating data in the recording unit 112 instead of overwriting each time monitoring is completed. The accumulated data can be used in checking the past condition.",
        "FIG. 4 is a flow chart of processing by the crisis monitoring terminal 100 according to the first embodiment.",
        "When the crisis monitoring terminal 100 is activated (step 401), once inside the communicable area, the crisis monitoring terminal 100 enters a watching state in which the terminal is ready to receive an inquiry signal sent from the crisis monitoring equipment 110 (step 402).",
        "When an inquiry signal from the crisis monitoring equipment 110 is received (step 403), the crisis monitoring terminal 100 uses the communication unit 104 to send a response signal to the crisis monitoring equipment 110 and request the apparatus to start observation (step 406).",
        "The crisis monitoring terminal 100 preferably sends personal information of the user recorded in the personal information management table 900, which is placed in the recording unit 102, along with the response signal, to the crisis monitoring equipment 110. Sending user's information which has been registered in advance enables the crisis monitoring equipment 110 to execute, when a disturbance is detected, the emergency response 311 that suit wills of individual users. In addition, by consulting the personal information management table 900, the crisis monitoring equipment 110 can monitor each user in a manner that corresponds to his/her condition regarding personal information desired monitoring hours.",
        "When an inquiry signal is not received from the crisis monitoring equipment 110 in the step 403, the crisis monitoring terminal 100 does not send a response signal and judges whether the user has operated the terminal to end monitoring (step 404).",
        "When detecting that it is operated to end monitoring, the crisis monitoring terminal 100 ends the process (step 405). On the other hand, when the crisis monitoring terminal 100 does not detect that it is operated to end monitoring, the process returns to the step 402 where the crisis monitoring terminal 100 watch an inquiry signal from the crisis monitoring equipment 110.",
        "FIG. 5 is a flow chart of processing executed by the crisis monitoring equipment 110 to detection a user's emotion from the result of observation.",
        "When the emotion detecting processing is started (step 501), the crisis monitoring equipment 110 decides an emotion from a user's voice inputted (step 502). This emotion detection is based on person's utterance. First, the inputted voice is analyzed and emotion detecting processing shown in FIG. 6 is applied.",
        "The emotion level may be used to judge a crisis. The level of an emotion can be obtained by counting how many times utterances conveying a specific emotion are made in a unit time, for instance, how many times angry words are spoken in 30 seconds. The higher the count of utterances conveying a specific emotion, the higher the level of the emotion. A higher emotion level is judged to indicate the greater seriousness of a crisis.",
        "In the case where the observation result can be converted into numeric values (emotion level), e.g. anger level is 60%, a crisis can be judged with a predetermined threshold as reference.",
        "Counting the number of times utterances conveying a specific emotion are made is merely an example of how to obtain the emotion level, and it is also possible to calculate the emotion level from a discriminant function value which is used in the emotion detection processing shown in FIG. 6.",
        "The emotion detected is stored as an observation result in a predetermined storage area, for example a register (step 503). The main program reads the observation result out of the predetermined storage area to make a final judgment about whether there is a disturbance (step 208).",
        "When another voice input is received, an emotion is determined based on this audio data (step 502) and the determined emotion is stored as an observation result (step 503). Then, processing end in step 504.",
        "FIG. 6 is a flow chart of the emotion detection processing by the crisis monitoring terminal 100 according to the first embodiment.",
        "To determine an emotion from his/her voice, sounds heard in the communicable area are observed and the feature of an unusual sound (for example, an angry shout, a scream or a cry) is analyzed.",
        "When the emotion detecting processing is started (step 601), first, a feature amount of a voice inputted through the input unit 111 is extracted (step 602). In the case where the feature amount is, for example, pitch, which shows highness or lowness of sound, the maximum pitch value in one utterance, the point at which the maximum pitch value is detected, the minimum pitch value, the point at which the minimum pitch value is detected, a mean pitch value and the like are extracted. In the case where the feature amount is energy, which represents the volume of sound, the maximum energy value in one utterance, the point at which the maximum energy value is detected, the minimum energy value, the point at which the minimum energy value is detected, a mean energy value and the like are extracted. Other known sound feature amounts may also be extracted.",
        "Instead of employing the pitch, energy, tempo or the like of one utterance as a feature amount, the amount of change in pitch, energy, tempo or the like in a unit time may serve as a feature amount.",
        "The extracted feature amount is classified with the use of a discriminant to thereby determine an emotion (step 603). A discriminant value is obtained from the general feature amount of a voice such as an angry shout or a scream which is learned in a preliminary study. The discriminant function value is calculated in a manner that sets the maximum value of anger to 1 and the normal state to \u22121.",
        "The extracted voice feature amount is translated into numerical terms using the discriminant function. When the function value is a positive value, the emotion which the voice conveys is judged as anger. Whereas, the emotion is judged as neutral when the function value is a negative value. The emotion level can also be judged by reading strong anger from a large positive value of the function value and by reading solid neutral from a large negative value of the function value.",
        "This method described above is merely an example to identify a person's emotion from his/her voice, and other known methods such as neural network analysis and multivariate analysis may be employed instead.",
        "The emotion detection in the step 603 uses an emotion database 604 shown in FIG. 7. The emotion database 604 is a record of results obtained by conducting a preliminary study on the typical feature amount of a voice and by extracting a value using a discriminant function. A voice feature amount extracted through the voice feature extracting processing of the step 602 is compared against a corresponding feature amount recorded in the emotion database 604, to thereby identify an emotion from a voice inputted.",
        "Then, in a step 605, specifically what emotion the utterer is feeling is determined from the result of the emotion detection of the step 603. Then, processing end in step 606.",
        "How to determine an emotion is not limited to the method illustrated by the emotion detection flow chart shown in FIG. 6. In one alternative method, it is determined that detection of a specific emotion is made when words that are likely to convey a specific emotion, such as \u201cStop it!\u201d, are recognized.",
        "Another alternative method uses manipulation of the input unit 111 in combination with speech emotion recognition. In this method, it is determined that a prescribed specific emotion is detected when a touch panel of the input unit 111 is touched or when a switch of the input unit 111 is operated.",
        "Other information than a person's voice may be monitored as long as it shows what situation a user is in. A camera may be employed to observe user's behavior and determine that the user is feeling a specific emotion when a specific motion or a specific facial expression is detected.",
        "Known speech emotion recognition techniques may also be employed to determine an emotion. In this case, a program to execute the technique of choice is stored in advance in the recording unit 112.",

Each of the variable data, angry shout and cry, includes variable values 703 to 707. The features of these voices are determined by the value of one or more such variables.",
        "Preferably, other emotions that reflect a person's mind, such as tension and a feeling of being threatened, are also detected. The emotion database 604 can include other items than those shown in FIG. 7, and an item is removed or added as necessary.",
        "FIG. 8 is an explanatory diagram of a crisis sound database 800.",
        "Many other sounds than a voice uttered by a person can be used to judge whether the person is in trouble. For instance, the system may be set to judge that a user is in trouble when a gunshot sound, a sound of glass shattering, and like other sounds that indicate a trouble are observed.",

        "Further, the personal information management table 900 includes predetermined alert word 905 is an arbitrary keyword set in advance. Utterance of the alert word is another indicator of a crisis situation in addition to a scream let out in emergency.",
        "Further, the personal information management table 900 includes variable values 906 to 910 which are characteristics of the voice of the user expressed in variables. The variable values 906 to 910 are registered by measuring in advance vocal sounds the user may make in emergencies. The variable values 906 to 910 constitute a reference database used in the emotion detection processing (step 603).",
        "The personal information management table 900 can include other items than those shown in FIG. 9, and an item is removed or added as necessary. Consulting personal information and characteristics items in judging a crisis reduces the chance of making an erroneous judgment. The information in the personal information management table 900 can also be use as information to identify a user who is victimized.",
        "As has been described above, the system according to the first embodiment detects a cry, an angry shout or the like in a confined public space such as an elevator by analyzing a person's emotion from his/her utterance, and reports the thus detected crisis situation. In this way, the system according to the first embodiment makes such spaces safe for its users.",
        "Preferably, the crisis monitoring equipment 110 constantly monitors a user while the user is using the system of this embodiment since a crisis can happen anytime. Constant monitoring, however, involves the problem of privacy violations by catching users' voices and images when they do not desire crisis monitoring. This problem is cleared by holding observation by the crisis monitoring equipment 110 until a signal from the crisis monitoring terminal 100 is received. Thus the system is made available to a user only when the user desires monitoring.",
        "The system that monitors for a limited period is also free from another drawback of constant monitoring, which is an increased chance of making an erroneous crisis judgment due to noise irrelevant to crisis monitoring and prolonged sound analysis time.",

The monitoring condition display screen 2000 is displayed on the liquid crystal display of the output unit 1415 of the crisis monitoring server 1410.",
        "The display screen 2000 displays map information 2001 of an area set as a monitoring area. The present condition (e.g. position information) of the user holding the crisis monitoring handheld terminal 1400 is shown on the map information 2001. The range set as the monitoring area is displayed in a specific color to make it easy to distinguish the monitoring area from other areas.",
        "Also displayed on the display screen 2000 are the geographical name of the area set as the monitoring area, and a symbol description 2002 of the map information 2001.",
        "Crisis-regarding data 2003 including personal information of the user who holds the crisis monitoring handheld terminal 1400, emergency response, and the user's present condition is displayed in text on the monitoring condition display screen 2000.",
        "Displaying a monitoring condition with the use of a GUI in this way enables the crisis monitoring server 1410 to obtain the present condition of the user in present time.",
        "The monitoring condition display screen 2000 is merely an example of a measure to display information on a user in a monitoring area, and may be replaced by other interfaces (e.g. a command line interface) as long as the replacement is capable of displaying the user's present condition.",
        "FIG. 21 is a configuration diagram of the present condition database 2100.",
        "The present condition database 2100 includes a user ID 2101, a user name 2102, a location 2103, a operative condition 2104 and a monitoring result 2105. The user ID 2101 is the number assigned to each crisis monitoring handheld terminal 1400. The user name 2102 is the name of a user who holds the crisis monitoring handheld terminal 1400, that is a monitoring subject. The location 2103 is where the crisis monitoring handheld terminal 1400 is located at present.",
        "The operative condition 2104 is the present operative condition of each crisis monitoring handheld terminal 1400. \u201cWaiting\u201d is recorded as the operative condition 2104 for the crisis monitoring handheld terminal 1400 that has not started observation yet. Each crisis monitoring handheld terminal 1400 enters an \u201cwaiting\u201d state when, for example, a user holding this crisis monitoring handheld terminal 1400 is outside an area he/she has set as a monitoring area, or when a user holding the crisis monitoring handheld terminal 1400 is in an area he/she has set as a monitoring area but does not want observation. When a user carrying the crisis monitoring handheld terminal 1400 enters a monitoring area and the crisis monitoring handheld terminal 1400 starts observation, \u201cobserving\u201d is recorded as the operative condition 2104.",
        "The monitoring result 2105 is a result of the judgment made on whether there is a disturbance or not from a user's voice and/or image observed by the crisis monitoring handheld terminal 1400.",
        "The present condition database 2100 can include other items than those shown in FIG. 21, and an item is removed or added as necessary.",
        "As has been described above, the system according to the third embodiment, in which the crisis monitoring handheld terminal 1400 having the function of the crisis monitoring equipment 110 is built in a cellular phone or a similar handheld terminal that a user holds, can detect from an angry shout or a cry that the user makes in trouble while the user is outdoor, and reports the detected crisis. The system according to the third embodiment is therefore capable of making outdoor spaces safe for its users.",
        "Preferably, the crisis monitoring server 1410 constantly monitors for a crisis in a public space prone to crimes since a crisis can happen anytime. Constant monitoring, however, involves the problem of an invasion of privacy by catching users' voices and images when they do not desire crisis monitoring.",
        "This problem is cleared by carrying out monitoring crisis only in a monitoring area specified by a user in advance with the use of the GPS system. Thus the crisis monitoring system is made available to a user only when the user desires monitoring.",
        "The system that monitors for a limited period is also free from another drawback of constant monitoring, which is an increased chance of making an erroneous crisis judgment due to noise irrelevant to crisis monitoring and prolonged sound analysis time.",
        "While the present invention has been described in detail and pictorially in the accompanying drawings, the present invention is not limited to such detail but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the purview of the appended claims."
