        "(b) the compound of formula (I\u2032) thus obtained is isolated and optionally converted into one of its salts or solvates or one of its quaternary ammonium salts.",
        "The reaction is carried out in an organic solvent at a temperature included between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent used.",
        "An aliphatic alcohol having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol is used as preferred organic solvent, but other solvents such as hexane, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, sulfolane, acetonitrile, pyridine and the like may also be used.",
        "The reaction is advantageously carried out in the presence of a basic agent such as an alkali hydroxide or carbonate or triethylamine, particularly in the case where L is a halogen atom.",
        "The reaction temperature may vary between room temperature (about 20\u00b0 C.) and that of reflux and the reaction times vary accordingly. In general, the reaction is terminated after 0.5 to 12 hours of heating at reflux and the final product thus obtained can be isolated according to conventional procedures in the form of the free base or one of its salts or solvates and the free base is optionally converted into one of its salts by simple salification in an organic solvent such as an alcohol, preferably ethanol or isopropanol, an ether like 1,2-dimethoxyethane, ethyl acetate, acetone or a hydrocarbon like hexane.",
        "The compound of formula (I\u2032) obtained and isolated according to the usual procedures is optionally converted into one of its quaternary ammonium salts by reaction with an alkyl halide of formula (IV):\n\nAlk-Hal\u2003\u2003(IV)\n\nwhere Alk is (C1-C4) alkyl and Hal is chlorine, bromine or iodine.",
        "The quaternary ammonium salt of formula (I\u2033a) thus obtained",
        "can be converted into another salt for example by an (X\u2212) charged anion exchange resin, where X\u2212 is a pharmaceutically acceptable anion other than Hal, and preferably the CH3SO3\u2212, C6H5SO3\u2212 or p-CH3-C6H5SO3\u2212 (paratoluenesulfonyloxy) anion.",
        "When the salts of the compounds of formula (I) and (I\u2032) are prepared to be administered as medicines, the acids used must be pharmaceutically acceptable; if the salts of the compounds of formula (I) and (I\u2032) are prepared for another purpose, for example to improve the purity or facilitate analytical tests or to separate the enantiomers in the presence of a chiral carbon atom, then any suitable acid or base may be used.",
        "The salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids are, for example, those with mineral acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, borate, phosphate, sulfate, hydrogen sulfate, hydrogen phosphate or dihydrogen phosphate and those with organic acids such as citrate, benzoate, ascorbate, methylsulfate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate, picrate, fumarate, maleate, malonate, oxalate, succinate, acetate, tartrate, mesylate, tosylate, isethionate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, \u03b1-glycerophosphate or glucose-1-phosphate.",

        "Alternatively, the starting materials (III) where R\u20322 is an optionally substituted phenyl group may also be prepared by carrying out the Suzuki reaction by working in an aqueous medium, namely by condensation between phenyl derivatives substituted by a leaving group and benzeneboronic acids in the presence of a catalyst, strong base(s) and phase transfer agent according to the conditions described by D. Badone et al., 212th ACS National Meeting, American Chemical Society, Orlando Fla., Aug. 25-29 1996, Abstract 351).",
        "The activity of the compounds of formula (I), in particular that of the compounds (I\u2032), on the nervous system was demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo studies according to the methods described in EP-0 458 696 and neuronal survival was evaluated with the aid of an in vitro survival test performed by using isolated neurons from dissections of the septal region of rat embryos.",
        "More particularly, a sample of the septal region of 17-18 days old rats was taken under a dissection microscope under sterile conditions, then it was dissociated in trypsin-EDTA medium. The cell suspension was placed in a culture flask in DME/Ham's F12 medium (v:v) (Dulbecco Modified Eagle medium/Ham's F12 Nutrient mixture\u2014R. G. Ham, Proc. Nat. Sci., 1965, 53: 288) containing 5% calf serum and 5% horse serum and maintained at 37\u00b0 C. for 90 minutes. This treatment permits the elimination of non-neuronal cells.",
        "The neuroblasts are then inoculated into the wells of a titration plate at 17\u00d7104 cells/cm2 in a non-serum culture medium constituted by DME/Ham's F12 containing selenium (30 nM) and transferrin (1.25 mM). Each well was subject to prior treatment with poly-L-lysine. The inoculated plates are placed in an incubator (37\u00b0 C.; 5% CO2).",
        "The test compounds are dissolved in DMSO and diluted as required by the culture medium.",
        "The neuroblasts are maintained on plates containing the test compound or the corresponding solvent for 4 days without changing the medium.",
        "After 4 days the medium is replaced by culture medium in which a tetrazolium salt is dissolved (0.15 mg/ml). The cells are then placed in the incubator at 37\u00b0 C. for 4 hours. The mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenases of the living cells reduce the tetrazolium salt to formazan blue, the optical density of which is measured at 540 nm after dissolution in DMSO and which is linearly correlated with the number of living cells (Manthorpe et al., Dev. Brain Res., 1988, 25: 191-198).",
        "The difference between the groups containing the test compounds and the controls was evaluated by statistical analysis using the two-tailed Dunnett t-test.",
        "In this latter test the compounds of formula (I), in particular those of formula (I\u2032), proved to be as active or more active than the compounds described in EP-0 458 696, the efficacy of certain compounds of formula (I\u2032) on the neuronal survival being twice that of compound A described in EP-0 458 696.",
        "As a result of this potent neuroprotective activity and their low toxicity compatible with use as medicines, the compounds of formula (I), in particular those of formula (I\u2032), as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts, their solvates and their quaternary ammonium salts, in particular those of formula (I\u2033), may be used for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions indicated in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of all diseases which involve neuronal degeneration, a use which constitutes a further feature of the present invention. More particularly, the invention relates to the use of the compounds of formula (I), in particular (I\u2032) and (I\u2033), alone or on co-administration or combination with other active ingredients acting on the CNS, for example, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, selective M1 cholinomimetics, NMDA antagonists, nootropics such as piracetam in the following indications: memory disorders, vascular dementia, post-encephalitic disorders, post-apoplectic disorders, post-traumatic syndromes due to a cranial traumatism, Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, subcortical dementia, such as Huntington chorea and Parkinson's disease, dementia caused by AIDS, neuropathies resulting from morbidity or damage to sympathetic or sensory nerves, cerebral diseases such as cerebral oedema and spinocerebellar degenerations, degeneration of motoneurons like for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",
        "The administration of the compounds according to the invention may be suitably performed by the oral, parenteral, sublingual or transdermal route. The quantity of active ingredient to be administered in the treatment of cerebral and neuronal disorders according to the method of the present invention depends on the nature and gravity of the diseases to be treated as well as on the weight of the patients. In general, the total dose in man varies between 1 and 1400 mg per day, advantageously between 2 and 900 mg per day, for example 3 to 500 mg, more suitably from 10 to 300 mg per day in pharmaceutical compositions. The compositions of the present invention are preferably administered in the form of dosage units. These unit doses will usually comprise from 0.5 to 700 mg, advantageously from 2 to 300 mg, preferably from 5 to 150 mg, for example between 5 and 50 mg, namely 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40 or 50 mg of product. These unit doses will usually be administered once or several times a day, for example 2, 3, 4 or 5 times per day, preferably one to three times a day.",
        "According to another of its features, the object of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition containing as active ingredients a compound of formula (I) above and a compound indicated in the symptomatic treatment of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.",
        "The expression \u201ccompound indicated in the symptomatic treatment of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT)\u201d indicates a product which is capable of improving the symptomatology of the patients suffering from DAT without having any effect on the causes of the disease.",
        "Such compounds are for example acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, M1 muscarinic agonists, nicotinic agonists, NMDA receptor antagonists, nootropic agents.",
