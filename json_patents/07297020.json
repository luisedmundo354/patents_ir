        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a cable connector for electrically connecting one ends of cables to a wiring board.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "A cable connector is used in practice for electrically connecting electric parts with each other in the interior of an electronic apparatus. For example, the electric parts are electrically connected to a printed circuit board via a flexible printed circuit board (FPC) or a flexible flat cable (FFC). There are a rotary type and a slide type in the cable connector used in practice, which are different in a method for fixing a cable. As disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2001-357920, Japanese Patent Nos. 3579827 and 2692055 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2002-289284, the rotary type cable connector includes a connector body disposed on a printed circuit board and having a cable accommodating section, a plurality of contact terminals provided in the cable accommodating section of the connector body, for electrically connecting an electrode part of the printed circuit board to a terminal section of a flexible printed circuit board, and an actuator member supported in a rotatable manner relative to the connector body, to be attachable to and/or detachable from contact points in the contact terminals of the terminal section in the flexible printed circuit board.",
        "The connector body has, at one end thereof, an inserting port for allowing the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board to be connected thereto. The inserting port is communicated to a cable accommodating section formed in the interior of the connector body. In a cut portion forming a top of the cable accommodating section in the connector body, opposite ends of a proximal part of the actuator member are supported in a rotatable manner. The actuator member occupies either a locked state in which the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board is sandwiched between a pressing surface and a movable terminal section of the respective contact terminal at a predetermined position or an unlocked state in which the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board is released. In the locked state, a site of action of the actuator member is closer to the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board and generally parallel thereto. On the other hand, in the unlocked state, the actuator member opens the cut portion on the top of the cable accommodating section so that the site of action of the actuating member is separated from the flexible printed circuit board to intersect with a plane in which the terminal section of the circuit board is formed to be rotatable until the site of action abuts to a wall surface forming the above-mentioned cut portion of the connector body. Accordingly, to attach or detach the flexible printed circuit board when the actuator member is in the unlocked state, it is desired that the rotational angle of the actuator member is determined to be relatively large to obtain a large opening of the above-mentioned inserting port so that the attachment/detachment of the flexible printed circuit board becomes easier.",
        "The actuator member has a pressing surface for pushing a back surface of the flexible printed circuit board toward the contact points of the contact terminals described later, while bringing the latter into contact with an end of a part of the actuator member opposed to the cable accommodating section.",
        "A plurality of contact terminals are arranged in the cable accommodating section in correspondence to the arrangement of the terminal section in the electrode part of the flexible printed circuit board. Each of these contact terminals includes a fixed terminal portion soldered to the terminal portion of the printed circuit board, a fixed portion, a movable terminal portion, and a coupling portion for connecting the fixed terminal portion to the fixed portion and the movable terminal portion.",
        "A front end of the fixed portion of the respective contact terminal is arranged to be opposed to a concavity formed in the actuator member. The movable terminal portion has, at its front end, a contact point to be electrically connected to the electrode section of the flexible printed circuit board.",
        "A coupling section thereof is-fixed to the connector body by being press-fit to a slit formed adjacent to a cable accommodating section.",
        "In such a structure, the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board is electrically connected to the contact point of the respective contact terminal in the following manner. After the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board is inserted into a position in the vicinity of a rear wall defining a rear side of the cable accommodating section through an inserting port, a front end of the actuator member is made to rotate such that a predetermined locked state is obtained. Accordingly, the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board contacts the contact terminal of the movable terminal portion in the contact terminal and is held there, creating a reliabel electric connection. At that time, the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board is sandwiched between the pressing surface of the actuator member and the elastically deformed movable terminal portion of the respective contact terminal.",
        "When the terminal section on one side of the flexible printed circuit board is connected to the cable connector and the terminal section on the other side of the flexible printed circuit board is connected to electric equipment movably disposed in the interior of the electronic apparatus, a bending moment or a pulling force larger than a predetermined value may be applied to the terminal section on the one side of the flexible circuit board. The repeated reciprocation of the electric equipment, for example, may cause such a load. Consequently, the actuator member may be transferred from the locked state to the unlocked state such that the terminal section of the cable connector on the one side of the flexible printed circuit board comes off of the cable connector.",
        "While taking the above-mentioned problems into account, an object of the present invention is to provide a cable connector for electrically connecting one end of a cable to a circuit board so that a terminal section of a flexible printed circuit board does not come off of the cable connector even if a pulling force or a bending moment larger than a predetermined value is applied to the terminal section on one side of the flexible printed circuit board, while ensuring sufficient opening of an inserting port.",
        "To achieve the above-mentioned object, the inventive cable connector comprises a cable accommodating section for accommodating one end of a cable, having contact terminals to be electrically connected to a terminal section of the cable and a positioning portion for positioning the cable terminal section relative to the contact terminals, the cable accommodating section communicating with an opening for allowing the cable terminal section to pass therethrough, and an actuator member disposed in the cable accommodating section for rotating movement. The acutator member has a pressing portion in correspondence to the respective contact terminal, the pressing portion comprising a flat surface and a pressing surface for locking or unlocking an electrode section of the cable terminal section relative to a movable contact part of the respective contact terminal. The pressing portion of the actuator member is movably supported by a fixed portion of the contact terminal. Preferably, the fixed portion of the contact terminal includes an angled (or slanted) portion formed continuous with a concavity allowing the fixed portion of the contact terminal to support the actuator member. The fixed portion of the contact terminal preferably formed opposite the movable contact part of the contact terminal at a predetermined distance. When the actuator member is in a locked state, a position of a site of action in the pressing surface of the actuator member relative to the cable terminal section is nearer to the positioning portion in the cable accommodating section than to a position of the movable contact part.",
        "The inventive cable connector may also comprise a cable accommodating section for accommodating one end of a cable, having contact terminals to be electrically connected to a terminal section of the cable and a positioning portion for positioning the cable terminal section relative to the contact terminals, the cable accommodating section communicating to an opening for allowing the cable terminal section to pass therethrough; and an actuator member disposed in the cable accommodating section for rotating movement. The acutator member preferably comprises a pressing portion in correspondence to the respective contact terminal, the pressing portion comprising a flat surface and a pressing surface for locking or unlocking an electrode section of the cable terminal section inserted into the cable accommodating section relative to a movable contact part of the respective contact terminal.",
        "In such a configuration, the relative position of the center of rotation of the pressing portion of the the actuator member relative to an engagement part of a fixed portion of the contact terminal moves as the actuator member rotates.",
        "As apparent from the above description, according to the inventive cable connector, the respective pressing portion of the actuator member is movably supported on the slant surface consecutive to the concavity formed in the fixed portion opposite the movable contact part of the respective contact terminal at a predetermined gap. Thereby, since a position of the operating portion of the pressing surface of the actuator member is nearer to the inner wall in the cable accommodating section than the movable contact part, a terminal section of a flexible printed circuit board does not come off from the cable connector even if a pulling force or a bending moment larger than a predetermined value is applied to the terminal section on one side of the flexible printed circuit board, while ensuring a sufficient opening of an inserting port.",

In this regard, the back plate 6B may have an operation part for facilitating the attachment/detachment of the flexible printed circuit board.",
        "On the other surface of the end of the flexible printed circuit board 6 (opposite to the back plate 6B), a group 6E of a plurality of electrodes, each having a width of 0.3 mm, is formed as the terminal section. The adjacent electrodes are formed to have a mutual space, for example, of approximately 0.5 mm.

        "As shown in FIG. 8, each of the lateral walls 4WR and 4WL has a notch into which a supporting shaft 8J is inserted in a rotatable manner, formed at the respective end of the actuator member 8.

        "As shown in FIG. 5, in a wall forming a back surface of the connector body 4, a plurality of slits 4S are formed into which are press-fit coupling parts 10C of the respective contact terminals 10ai. The respective slit is formed at a predetermined mutual pitch along a longitudinal direction of the connector body 4 and communicates with the interior of the cable accommodating section 4A.

        "Thereby, the actuator member 8 supported rotatably via the bearings 4BE of the connector body 4 occupies a locked position wherein the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board 6 is pinched between the pressing surface 8c and the movable terminal portion 10A of the respective contact terminal 10ai as shown in FIG. 6, and an unlocked position wherein the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board 6 is released as shown in FIG. 2. That is, in the locked position, the actuator member 8 is generally parallel to the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board 6, and in the unlocked position, the actuator member 8 opens the opening 4AP of the cable accommodating section 4A, intersects with a surface on which the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board 6 is formed, and is rotational moveable until it is brought into contact with the slant 4SL of the connector body 4.",
        "According to a first method for assembling the actuator member 8 and the plurality of contact terminals 10ai in predetermined positions of the connector body 4, after the supporting shafts 8J of the actuator member 8 are placed on the bearings 4BE, the outer periphery of the fastening member 12 is first inserted into the groove 4G. Then, after the actuator member 8 is located at the above-mentioned unlocked position (see FIG. 2), the contact terminal 10ai is press-fit into the interior of the connector body 4 in the direction indicated by an arrow in FIG. 10A via the slit 4S while front ends of the movable contact terminal portion 10A and the fixed portion 10B are at the head thereof. At that time, as shown in FIG. 10B, the flat surfaces 8a and 8b of the pressing portion 8A in the actuator member 8 are arranged in a plane common to the flat surface portion 10Ge of the contact terminal 10 ai.",
        "Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 10C, the flat surface portion 10Ge of the contact terminal 19ai is further press-fitted in the same direction. At that time, since there is the arc-shaped portion 10Gb of the contact terminal 10ai functioning also as a play for avoiding the interference, the engagement is smoothly carried out without being interfered with the flat surface 8a of the pressing portion 8A in the actuator member 8. And, as shown in FIG. 10D, the flat surface portion 10Ge of the contact terminal 10ai is further pushed in the connector body 4 in the same direction until the sliding surface 8d touches to the slant part 10Ga, whereby the attachment of the contact terminal 10ai to the connector body 4 is completed. Accordingly, when the contact terminal 10ai is attached to the connector body 4, there is no risk in that the pressing portion 8A of the actuator member 8 is excessively scraped by the front end of the contact terminal 10ai.",
        "According to a second method for assembling the actuator member 8 and the plurality of contact terminals 10ai with predetermined positions of the connector body 4, as shown in FIGS. 15A to 15D, after the supporting shafts 8J of the actuator member 8 are placed on the bearings 4BE, the outer periphery of the fastening member 12 is first inserted into the groove 4G. Then, after the actuator member 8 is located at the above-mentioned locked position (see FIGS. 11 and 12), the contact terminal 10ai is press-fitted into the interior of the connector body 4 in the direction indicated by an arrow in FIG. 15A via the slit 4S while front ends of the movable contact terminal portion 10A and the fixed portion 10B are at the head thereof. At that time, as shown in FIG. 15B or FIG. 14 in enlarged dimension, a position of the sliding surface 8d of the pressing portion 8A in the actuator member 8 are set to have a predetermined gap CL from a plane common to the flat surfaces 10Ge of the contact terminal 10ai.",
        "Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 15C, the flat surface portion 10Ge of the contact terminal 10ai is further press-fitted in the same direction. At that time, since there is the arc-shaped portion 10Gb of the contact terminal 10ai functioning also as a play for avoiding the interference, the engagement is smoothly carried out without being interfered with the pressing portion 8A in the actuator member 8. And, as shown in FIGS. 13 and 15D, the flat surface portion 10Ge of the contact terminal 10ai is further pushed into the connector body 4 in the same direction until the sliding surface 8d touches to the slant part 10Ga, whereby the attachment of the contact terminal 10ai to the connector body 4 is completed. Accordingly, in the same manner as in the above-mentioned first method, when the contact terminal 10ai is attached to the connector body 4, there is no risk in that the pressing portion 8A of the actuator member 8 is excessively scraped by the front end of the contact terminal 10ai. That is, even if the actuator member 8 is either in the unlocked position or in the locked position, it is possible to easily attach the contact terminal 10ai to the connector body 4.",
        "In such a structure, when the group of the electrode 6E (the back plate 6B) of the flexible printed circuit board 6 to the respective contact terminal 10ai, as shown in FIGS. 9A and 16A, a front end of the back plate 6B of the flexible printed circuit board 6 is inserted into the opening 4AP while keeping the actuator member 8 in the unlocked state until it touches to the inner wall 4a forming the rear side of the cable accommodating section 4A. Thereafter, the operating part of the actuator member 8 is made to rotate counterclockwise as indicated by an arrow in FIG. 9B to move toward the locked state.",
        "At that time, since the sliding surface 8d of the rotating actuator member 8 is guided while sliding along the slant part 10Ga of the contact terminal 10ai, the flat surface 8b of the pressing portion 8A is somewhat moved forward while rotating until it is brought into contact with the back plate 6B. Also, as shown in FIG. 16B, a relative position P1 of the center of rotation of the pressing portion 8A relative to the engagement part in the initial position begins to move along a predetermined locus toward a relative position P2 of the center of rotation relative to the engagement part upon the completion of rotation.",
        "Next, as shown in FIG. 9C, the operating part of the actuator member 8 is made to further rotate in the same direction, and the pressing surface 8c thereof presses the back plate 6B downward, while rotating, toward the contact point section 10a. And, since the operating part of the actuator member 8 is further made to rotate until coming close to the surface of the back plate 6B as shown in FIGS. 9D and 16C, the sliding surface 8d is supported by the arc-shaped portion 10Gb and made to rotate to be in contact with the surface of the back plate 6B. Thereby, the pressing surface 8c further rotates via the back plate 6B to a position nearer to the inner wall 4a than a position of the contact point section 10a of the contact terminal 10ai disposed directly beneath the same, and made to stop there. At that time, the contact position between the pressing surface 8c and the back plate 6B is closer to the inner wall 4a than the relative positions P2 and P1 of the above-mentioned center of rotation of the pressing portion 8A relative to the engagement part.",
        "Accordingly, the electrode group 6E in the flexible printed circuit board 6 is pressed to the contact point section 10a of the movable terminal portion 10A in the contact terminal 10ai by the pressing surface 8c of the actuator member 8, and held to be electrically connected thereto. The back plate 6B of the flexible printed circuit board 6 is pinched between the pressing surface 8c of the actuator member 8 and the elastically deformed movable terminal portion 10A of the respective contact terminal 10ai. At that time, since the center of rotation of the pressing portion 8A is located directly above the contact point section 10a of the contact terminal 10ai and the point of application on the pressing surface 8c is closer to the inner wall 4a than to the contact point section 10a, the clockwise rotation of the actuator member 8 is inhibited even if the pulling force or the bending moment is applied to the other end of the flexible printed circuit board 6. Thereby, there is no risk in that the one end of the flexible printed circuit board 6 is removed from the cable connector.",
        "Further, since the relative position P1 of the center of rotation of the pressing portion 8A relative to the engagement part moves along the predetermined locus toward the relative position P2 which is the center of rotation thereof relative to the engagement part upon the completion of the rotation, it is possible to select a relatively large opening angle of the actuator member 8.",
        "On the other hand, when the flexible printed circuit board 6 located as shown in FIG. 9D is removed from the connector body 4, the operating part of the actuator member 8 is made to rotate clockwise as indicated by an arrow in FIG. 9C; such that the unlocked state is obtained. At that time, after the sliding surface 8d of the rotating actuator member 8 moves around the arc-shaped portion 10Gb of the contact terminal 10ai, the pressing surface 8c is away from the back plate 6B and the sliding surface 8d is guided while being guided along the slant part 10Ga, whereby the flat surface 8b of the pressing portion 8A somewhat moves while rotating, until it approaches the back plate 6B. And, as shown in FIG. 9A,the upper surface of the actuator member 8 is brought into contact with the slant 4SL of the socket body 4. Accordingly, since the flat surface 8b of the pressing portion 8A somewhat moves until it is close to the back plate 6B while rotating, the opening angle of the actuator member 8 becomes larger in comparison with the prior art device.",
        "The present invention has been described in detail with respect to preferred embodiments, and it will now be apparent from the foregoing to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspect, and it is the intention, therefore, in the appended claims to cover all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit of the invention."
