    "abstract": "The present invention discloses a ferroelectric transistor having a conductive oxide in the place of the gate dielectric. The conductive oxide gate ferroelectric transistor can have a three-layer metal/ferroelectric/metal or a two-layer metal/ferroelectric on top of the conductive oxide gate. By replacing the gate dielectric with a conductive oxide, the bottom gate of the ferroelectric layer is conductive through the conductive oxide to the silicon substrate, thus minimizing the floating gate effect. The memory retention degradation related to the leakage current associated with the charges trapped within the floating gate is eliminated. The fabrication of the ferroelectric transistor by a gate etching process or a replacement gate process is also disclosed.",

    "description": [
        "This invention related generally to semiconductor device and nonvolatile memory transistor, and more particularly to ferroelectric gate transistor structures and methods of fabrication.",
        "Ferroelectric materials are composed of many randomly-distributed permanently polarized regions. When an electric field is applied, the regions with a polarization component in the direction of the electric field grow at the expense of the non-aligned regions so that a net polarization can result. If the electric field decreases, the polarization also decreases but at a slower rate so that even when the electric field becomes zero, a remnant polarization remains. A negative coercive field is required to bring the polarization to zero. This hysteresis behavior of a ferroelectric material is the basis of ferroelectric nonvolatile memory devices.",
        "Currently there are two types of ferroelectric nonvolatile memory devices: ferroelectric capacitor which uses a transistor to detect the polarization of a ferroelectric capacitor, and ferroelectric transistor which detects a change in the transistor conductance caused by the polarization of a ferroelectric gate material. The ferroelectric transistor is much more advantageous than the ferroelectric capacitor due to the smaller surface area thus enabling higher density memory chip, and the non-destructive readout, thus significantly reducing the fatigue problem.",
        "The ferroelectric transistor is typically a ferroelectric-gate-controlled semiconductor field-effect transistor (FET), which employs a ferroelectric film in the gate stack of the FET, and in which a proper polarization of the ferroelectric film can create an inversion layer in a channel region of the transistor. The basic ferroelectric-gate controlled field-effect transistor is a metal-ferroelectric silicon (MFS) FET. The term MFS represents the layers in the gate stack of the ferroelectric transistor. Thus the gate stack of the MFS transistor consists of a metal (M) gate electrode disposed on a ferroelectric (F) gate dielectric on the silicon (S) channel of the transistor. FIG. 1 shows the schematic of an n-channel MFS transistor. A ferroelectric film 12 is formed as a gate insulating film on a p-type silicon substrate 13, together with source 14 and drain 15 regions having a high concentration of n-type impurity ions. A metal gate electrode 11 is formed over the ferroelectric film 12. The MFS transistor is isolated by the isolation trenches 16.",
        "However, effective transistor operation of the above MFS transistor is difficult to achieve due to the requirement of the ferroelectric/silicon interface. When a ferroelectric film is deposited directly on the silicon substrate, metals and oxygen from the ferroelectric layer may diffuse into the ferroelectric-silicon interface, creating interface trap charges, affecting the polarization of the ferroelectric film, and overall may make the operation of the ferroelectric transistor becoming unstable. Further, since the thermal expansion coefficient and lattice structure of a ferroelectric film is not compatible with silicon, it is very difficult to form a high-quality ferroelectric film with a clean interface directly on the silicon substrate.",
        "To address the drawbacks posed by the direct ferroelectric/silicon interface, a gate dielectric and a floating metal gate can be inserted between the ferroelectric film and the silicon substrate. The ferroelectric transistor is then called metal-ferroelectric-oxide (or insulator) silicon (MFOS or MFIS) FET or metal-ferroelectric-metal-oxide (or insulator) silicon (MFMOS or MFMIS) FET. FIG. 2A shows a MFOS memory transistor using a gate oxide layer 27 formed between the silicon substrate 13 and the ferroelectric film 12. Alternatively, a metal floating gate layer 28 can be added between the ferroelectric film 12 and the gate oxide layer 27 as shown in FIG. 2B for a MFMOS transistor. A suitable conducting material (e.g. Pt or Ir) is normally selected for the floating gate 28 to allow the deposition of the ferroelectric thin film and to prevent diffusion of the ferroelectric material into the gate dielectric and the channel. The floating gate layer 28 is also called bottom electrode, or bottom gate, in reference to the other gate electrode 11, called top electrode, or top gate.",
        "Such gate stack structures (metal-ferroelectric-oxide gate stack or metal-ferroelectric-metal-oxide gate stack) overcome the surface interface and surface state issues of a ferroelectric layer in contact with the silicon substrate. However, they incorporate other difficulties such as higher operation voltage and trapped charges in the bottom floating gate layer. The operation voltage of these transistors is higher than the ferroelectric layer programming voltage by an amount of the voltage across the gate dielectric. And when there is a voltage applied across the ferroelectric thin film, there will be current flow in the gate stack, and charges would be trapped in this floating electrode. The trapped charges may neutralize the polarization charges at the interface of the bottom electrode and the ferroelectric film and could shorten the memory retention time of this structure.",
        "The present invention addresses both the higher operation voltage and the trapped charge issues in the ferroelectric memory transistor and discloses an improved ferroelectric memory transistor structure and fabrication methods.",
        "Various prior designs have been disclosed to compensate for the trapped charges in the floating bottom electrode. Black et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,069,381, entitled \u201cFerroelectric memory transistor with resistively coupled floating gate\u201d discloses a resistor between the bottom floating gate electrode and the source/drain to remove the trapped charges. This additional resistor ensures that the potential of the floating gate will approach that of the source/drain region after a certain delay time, but this could affect the high speed switching characteristics of the ferroelectric memory. Yoo, U.S. Pat. No. 5,812,442, entitled \u201cFerroelectric memory using leakage current and multi-numerical system ferroelectric memory\u201d discloses a leakage gate dielectric to remove the trapped charges. The leakage current is generated by a Schottky emission or a Frankel-Poole emission or Fowler-Nordheim tunneling to reduce the bound charges in the bottom metal electrode. In either designs, the higher operation voltage issue still remains due to the presence of the gate dielectric.",
        "Another prior art design to reduce the trapped charges in the lower electrode is the formation of a Schottky diode such as a metal-ferroelectric-metal silicon (MFMS) device disclosed in Nakao et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,303,182, entitled \u201cNonvolatile semiconductor memory utilizing a ferroelectric film\u201d. A Schottky barrier is formed between the bottom metal electrode of the gate unit (or a very shallow junction layer) and the silicon substrate. The Schottky ferroelectric gate memory transistor requires a space between the bottom electrode and the source and drain region or a very shallow n-channel under the gate, therefore the drive current of the Schottky ferroelectric gate memory transistor can be relatively low.

        "The present invention discloses a ferroelectric transistor having a conductive oxide in the place of the gate dielectric. By replacing the gate dielectric with a conductive oxide, the bottom gate of the ferroelectric layer is conductive through the conductive oxide to the silicon substrate, therefore there is no floating gate effect. The memory retention degradation related to the leakage current associated with the charges trapped within the floating gate is eliminated. Furthermore, the operating voltage for the ferroelectric transistor can be reduced to the ferroelectric layer programming voltage because of the absence of the gate dielectric.",
        "The present invention ferroelectric transistor can be a metal-ferroelectric-metal-conductive oxide silicon (MFMCS) FET. The gate stack of the MFMCS transistor has a top metal electrode (or top gate) disposed on a ferroelectric layer disposed on a bottom metal electrode (or bottom gate) disposed on a conductive oxide layer on the silicon substrate.",

In the gate etching process, the multilayer gate stack is deposited and etched, while in the replacement gate process, a replacement gate stack is deposited as a place holder for the fabrication of other portions of the device, then the replacement gate stack is removed and the functional gate stack is deposited.",

        "The ferroelectric transistor of the present invention is a ferroelectric field effect transistor having a conductive oxide layer replacing the gate dielectric. Thus the present invention ferroelectric transistor is called a conductive oxide gate ferroelectric transistor, and is preferably used in nonvolatile memory applications.",
        "The first embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 3, illustrating an n-channel conductive oxide gate ferroelectric transistor. The gate stack of the present invention comprises a top gate electrode 63, a ferroelectric film 62, a bottom gate electrode 61 and a conductive oxide gate 51, positioning on a p-type silicon substrate 63, and disposed between the source 64 and drain 65 regions having a high concentration of n-type impurity ions. The ferroelectric transistor is isolated by the isolation trenches 66. The gate insulator of the present invention transistor is replaced with a conductive oxide such as InO2 or RuO2 to prevent floating gate effect.",
        "FIG. 4 show the operation of the above n-channel conductive oxide ferroelectric transistor. In FIG. 4A, when a positive voltage is applied to the gate electrode 63, polarization of the ferroelectric film 62 occurs with electrons are pulled to the top and holes are pulled to the bottom of the ferroelectric film. Electrons are then accumulated at the conductive oxide and the surface of the silicon under the ferroelectric gate stack. This forms a high conductive channel 67. Therefore the ferroelectric transistor is \u201cON\u201d, i.e. if a voltage bias is placed across the source 64 and the drain 65, a current will flow through the transistor. The ferroelectric transistor memory is nonvolatile, meaning that the transistor remains in the ON state even after this positive voltage is removed due to the remnant polarization of the ferroelectric film 62.",
        "In FIG. 4B, when a negative voltage is applied to the gate electrode 61, opposite polarization occurs in the ferroelectric film 62 with holes are pulled to the top of the ferroelectric gate and electrons are pulled to the bottom of the ferroelectric film. Holes then are accumulated at the conductive oxide and the surface of the silicon under the ferroelectric gate stack. There are no conduction channel 67, and the ferroelectric transistor is \u201cOFF\u201d, i.e. a non-conduction state takes place between the source 64 and drain 65 regions, which is maintained even after the negative voltage is removed.",
        "The conductive oxide prevents the bottom electrode 61 from direct contact to the n+ source and drain junctions. Since the bottom electrode 61 is connected to the silicon through the conductive oxide 51, the bottom electrode 61 is not electrically isolated, therefore would not be able to accumulate charges likes a floating gate. The charge retention time of this device is thus independent of the current flow through the ferroelectric thin film.",
        "In the second embodiment of the invention, the bottom gate electrode is omitted. Thus gate stack of the conductive oxide gate ferroelectric transistor comprises a top gate electrode 163, a ferroelectric film 162, and a conductive oxide gate 151 as shown in FIG. 5.",
        "The conductive oxide in the present invention is preferably a conductive metal oxide, but can be a conductive oxide without any metal components. The conductive oxide can make good interface with the silicon substrate, and can be selected to have a good lattice matching with the deposited ferroelectric film, especially ones having perovskite crystal structures.",
        "Furthermore, a conductive oxide serving as electrodes for the ferroelectric film may improve the quality of the ferroelectric film, and thus the operation of the ferroelectric transistor. A ferroelectric film is generally formed in an oxidizing ambience such as a deposition process with oxygen as a reactive gas, or an annealing process in an oxygen ambience to improve the stability of the deposited ferroelectric film. Therefore the electrode material for a ferroelectric film is preferable an oxidization resistant noble metal such as Pt and Ir. Conductive oxides is already oxidation resistant, and further, due to the high concentration of oxygen, the conductive oxide film can suppress the movement and accumulation of oxygen at the ferroelectric/conductive oxide interface to improve the reliability such as fatigue and the controllability of the ferroelectric and therefore its polarization property.",
        "One further advantage of conductive metal oxide is the etch selectivity. Oxygen can be used as an etching gas for conductive metal oxides since a steam pressure of metal oxide is typically very high. The conductive metal oxide therefore can be etched with high selective etching rate to other dielectric films. In addition, the conductive metal oxide and the metal can have high selective etching rate since the conductive metal oxide films (RuO2, for example) normally cannot easily react with halogen such as F and Cl used for etching the metal films.",
        "The conductive metal oxide film is preferably an oxide film of any one metal selected from a group of Mo, W, Tc, Re, Ru, Os, Rh, Ir, Pd, Pt, In, Zn, Sn, Sr\u2014Ru or Sr\u2014Co (such as IrO2 and RuO2), or a rock-salt (NaCl) crystal structure face-centered cubic metal oxide, such as NdO, NbO, SmO, LaO, and VO. The preferred method of forming the conductive oxide is by deposition. However, other methods may be used such as doping by diffusion and ion implantation. For example, the conductive oxide can be boron (B) doped or fluorine (F) doped ZnO and antimony (Sb) doped or fluorine (F) doped SnO2.",
        "The conductive oxide may be composed of any number of conductive perovskite oxides such as lanthanum strontium cobalt oxide (LSCO).
