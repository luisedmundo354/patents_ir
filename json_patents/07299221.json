    "title": "Progressive relaxation of search criteria",
    "abstract": "An efficient information search mechanism provides control over the relaxation of a search query to users that are requesting searches. Through such a mechanism, a user can specify a sequence of sub-queries that is associated with variations of the main search criteria, and specify a progression in which to execute the sub-queries. Hence, users can impart their priorities with respect to search term variations used in relaxing the main search criteria, which further allows the users to impart their notion of the relevance of results that may be returned by particular sub-queries. A query that includes a sequence of sub-queries is received and the sub-queries are executed, if at all, by a database server in an order based on the progression specified by the user. Response time and network loading are improved through reduction of unnecessary work by the database server and through reduction of computationally costly communications between client and server and associated processing.",

        "The present invention relates generally to information retrieval and, more specifically, to techniques for specifying progressive relaxation of search criteria.",
        "Applications for servicing client, or end user, queries often operate such that not only are exact matches for a user-specified query identified if they exist, but the closest non-exact matches are also identified and returned to the end user. In this context, the term \u201cquery\u201d is not limited to a conventional database query, such as a query in SQL (Structured Query Language). Generally, a query includes any search for information through any search mechanism, such as a conventional search engine or search function. Typically, the user's search request is eventually transformed into a structured database query.",
        "One approach to servicing search requests or queries, in order to identify existing exact matches and non-exact matches, involves: (1) rewriting or reconstructing the user query to include all allowable variations of the original query; (2) retrieving a \u201chit-list\u201d for the reconstructed concatenated query by submitting the query to a database server; and (3) ordering the hit-list in an order based on the relevance to the original search criteria (sometimes referred to as \u201crelevance ranking\u201d).",
        "For example, if a user initiates a search for information on \u201ccheap pen\u201d on some form of information repository, such as a database or the collection of information that is accessible via the Internet, an \u201cexpanded query\u201d is constructed to include both the original query and to include one or more sub-queries that relax the requirements of the original query. An expanded query associated with a search for \u201ccheap pen\u201d might include sub-queries for other allowable versions of \u201ccheap pen,\u201d such as \u201ccheap NEAR pen,\u201d \u201ccheap AND pen,\u201d \u201c$cheap AND $pen\u201d (where \u201c$\u201d represents a grammatical stem operation), \u201ccheap OR pen\u201d and the like. A hit-list is produced based on this set of sub-queries, and the hit-list is then ordered. The ordering may be based on, for example, the specific sub-query that produced a given hit and a speculative relevance to the end user that is requesting the information.",
        "In such an approach, useless work may be performed because all of the sub-queries are executed, whether or not necessary to actually fulfill the user's request and interest. That is, the first sub-query executed may produce a sufficient number of hits or sufficiently relevant results to satisfy the user's interest. Furthermore, if a given sub-query is particularly unselective, it may produce many more hits than are necessary to satisfy the user's interest and unnecessary work is performed by parsing the query statement, querying the information repository, and producing and ordering the results.",
        "Another approach involves: (1) executing sub-queries associated with allowable variations of the original query, in series in descending order of priority; and (2) retrieving hits until enough hits have been located, based on some criteria. This approach involves an entity other than the database server, such as an end user or a search mechanism, issuing a query to the database server based on the original search criteria, receiving results from the query, issuing another query to the database server that expands the original search criteria, receiving results, and continuing this iterative process until the search request has been satisfied according to some quantitative criteria. Query response time and network performance suffer when using this approach due to the potential for multiple complete round-trip communications between the entity and the database server, which unnecessarily load the system. In this context, and throughout the specification, a complete round-trip communication refers to the network communication between a client entity and a database server, as well as the processing performed by the database server, which often includes: (1) parsing the query; (2) constructing a query execution plan; (3) optimizing the query execution; and the like. Secondary client-server communications refer to communications between client and server applications which do not incur the same processing overhead as complete round-trip communications.",
        "Both of the foregoing approaches are inefficient in terms of response time, processing, and network loading. Furthermore, these approaches are cumbersome for developers of search applications and mechanisms because they require such applications and mechanisms to speculatively relax the search requirements and process results with respect to relevance ranking. Furthermore, they provide limited capabilities, if any, for end users to affect the priority of search term variations in the context of relaxation of the original search criteria and, consequently, the relevance of associated results.",
        "Based on the foregoing, it is clearly desirable to provide an improved mechanism for servicing information searches. There is a more specific need to provide more control to an end user that is requesting a search for particular information to provide more efficient and more relevant performance.",

In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.",
        "In order to provide a more efficient search mechanism, control over the relaxation of a search query is provided to users that are requesting searches. Progressive relaxation of queries allows for complex queries without compromising performance. Generally, complex queries are processed to provide increased recall, or completeness, of results without compromising the precision, or quality, of the results. Through such a mechanism, a user can specify a sequence of sub-queries that is associated with variations of the main search term, and specify a progression in which to execute the sub-queries. Hence, users can impart their priorities with respect to search term variations used in relaxing the main search criteria, which further allows the users to impart their notion of the relevance of results that may be returned by particular sub-queries. Unlike prior approaches, the sub-queries are not all immediately and fully executed by the database server when they are received. Rather, each sub-query is only executed when the previously executed sub-query has not produced results that satisfy the user.",
        "In an embodiment, the sub-queries select data from a database based on search criteria associated with the information being requested, which may include variations of original search terms, and the progression according to which the sub-queries are executed corresponds to a progressive relaxation of the original search terms.",
        "According to one aspect, a series of sub-queries specified by a user are received at a server, for example, and executed in an order based on the progression specified by the user. Hence, multiple sub-queries may be executed by the server in response to only a single complete round-trip communication between the user/client and the server, and the server need only process a single query. Network loading and response time and are thereby improved.",
        "In an embodiment, a series of sub-queries specified by a user are received at the database server in a single round-trip communication. The server then executes the sub-queries in an order based on the progression specified by the user, however, each sub-query is executed only if the results of the previously executed sub-queries were not sufficient to fulfill the search request. For example, if the user requests a specific number of result hits, the sub-queries are executed in series until the number of requested hits have been produced, but no more sub-queries than are necessary are executed. Thus, for example, if execution of the first sub-query provides enough hits or sufficiently relevant hits to satisfy the user request, then none of the other sub-queries are executed and, consequently, computational resources are conserved. In such an embodiment, the user may specify \u201cstop criteria\u201d (e.g., a minimum number of hits, an amount of time, a volume of data, or a combination of such criteria) through interaction with a user interface prior to submission of a search. Once the search results satisfy the stop criteria, the database server does not execute any further sub-queries. Hence, this user-specified stop criteria approach would only require one complete round-trip communication between the client and server, and the server need only process a single query.",
        "Alternatively, the user may iteratively request more hits through interaction with a user interface, as needed to satisfy the user's interest. In this case, the user interaction is not sending a new query, but indicating that the server is to proceed to the next sub-query in the original received query. Similarly to the user-specified stop criteria approach, only one complete round-trip communication and associated processing is required. This scenario may require multiple secondary communications between the client and server because the server does not have knowledge of the stop criteria prior to formulation of a query execution plan. However, these secondary client-server communications are not computationally expensive, complete round-trip communications that require significant query processing overhead.",
        "Non-limiting examples of some benefits provided by the techniques described herein are (1) a reduction in network load due to a reduction in computationally expensive complete round-trip communications between a client and a server; (2) a reduction in unnecessary load on a database server due to executing queries that are not actually required to meet an end-user's needs; (3) an elimination or reduction in work from a search engine or middleware application with respect to relevance ranking processing; and (4) ease of use, by shifting work to a database server from an end user, and/or ease of application development, by shifting work to a database server from a search engine or middleware application, both with respect to construction of queries based on original search terms.",

The query that is received may, for example, include sub-queries that are associated with a particular section of a document.",
        "At block 404, one or more of the sub-queries are executed in an order specified by the progression. In one embodiment, the process includes receiving a request for a particular number of results from the search, for example, along with the query received at block 402 or iteratively from an end user or otherwise. For an example of the iterative process, an end user may request, with successive communications, query results ten at a time. Thus, a database server or search mechanism successively provides the results in response to those requests, i.e., ten at a time. Furthermore, each sub-query of the one or more sub-queries is executed only if previously executed sub-queries have not produced results sufficient to fulfill the request for the specified number of results. For example, if the first executed sub-query produces thirty results and the user is iteratively requesting hits ten at a time, then the second sub-query is not executed until the user requests the thirty-first through fortieth hits.",
        "In contrast to prior approaches using concatenated queries, all of the sub-queries are not necessarily executed. Further, in contrast with prior approaches in which each sub-query is submitted to the database server in series, the present embodiment can submit multiple sub-queries to the database server using only one complete round-trip communication between an end user that is requesting the search, such as at client 102 (FIG. 1) and a server that is searching for the information, such as database server 106 (FIG. 1). Control over which sub-queries are actually executed, and in what order, is provided by the end user rather than assumed by a software application and/or search engine or function, and is applied by the database server.",
        "In one embodiment, all of the sub-queries select data from a database based on a respective particular set of values, i.e., search criteria, and the progression corresponds to a relaxation of the search criteria. For example, a sub-query is constructed for each of the original search term and variations of the search term \u201ccheap pen\u201d, using a particular set of values such as (1) \u201ccheap\u201d and \u201cpen\u201d, (2) a stem of \u201ccheap\u201d and \u201cpen\u201d, and (3) \u201ccheap\u201d or pen\u201d. Therefore, the search criteria \u201ccheap pen\u201d is progressively relaxed by executing the associated sub-queries, which expand the search, according to the specified progression.",
        "FIG. 5 is a block diagram that illustrates a computer system 500 upon which an embodiment of the invention may be implemented. Computer system 500 includes a bus 502 or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a processor 504 coupled with bus 502 for processing information. Computer system 500 also includes a main memory 506, such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, coupled to bus 502 for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor 504. Main memory 506 also may be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be executed by processor 504. Computer system 500 further includes a read only memory (ROM) 508 or other static storage device coupled to bus 502 for storing static information and instructions for processor 504. A storage device 510, such as a magnetic disk, optical disk, or magneto-optical disk, is provided and coupled to bus 502 for storing information and instructions.",
        "Computer system 500 may be coupled via bus 502 to a display 512, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) or a liquid crystal display (LCD), for displaying information to a computer user. An input device 514, including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus 502 for communicating information and command selections to processor 504. Another type of user input device is cursor control 516, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor 504 and for controlling cursor movement on display 512. This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.",
        "The invention is related to the use of computer system 500 for implementing the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention, those techniques are performed by computer system 500 in response to processor 504 executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory 506. Such instructions may be read into main memory 506 from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device 510. Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory 506 causes processor 504 to perform the process steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.",
        "The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor 504 for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical, magnetic, or magneto-optical disks, such as storage device 510. Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory 506. Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus 502. Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave and infra-red data communications.",
        "Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD, any other optical or magneto-optical medium, punchcards, papertape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer can read.",
        "Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor 504 for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system 500 can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red transmitter to convert the data to an infra-red signal. An infra-red detector can receive the data carried in the infra-red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus 502. Bus 502 carries the data to main memory 506, from which processor 504 retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory 506 may optionally be stored on storage device 510 either before or after execution by processor 504.",
        "Computer system 500 also includes a communication interface 518 coupled to bus 502. Communication interface 518 provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link 520 that is connected to a local network 522. For example, communication interface 518 may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example, communication interface 518 may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface 518 sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.",
        "Network link 520 typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, network link 520 may provide a connection through local network 522 to a host computer 524 or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) 526. ISP 526 in turn provides data communication services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d 528. Local network 522 and Internet 528 both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link 520 and through communication interface 518, which carry the digital data to and from computer system 500, are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information.",
        "Computer system 500 can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link 520 and communication interface 518. In the Internet example, a server 530 might transmit a requested code for an application program through Internet 528, ISP 526, local network 522 and communication interface 518.",
        "The received code may be executed by processor 504 as it is received, and/or stored in storage device 510, or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, computer system 500 may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.",
        "Alternative embodiments of the invention are described throughout the foregoing description, and in locations that best facilitate understanding the context of the embodiments. Furthermore, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. For example, embodiments are described in the context of database queries; however, the techniques described are applicable to electronic searches for information, in general. For another example, embodiments are described in the context of text searches; however, the techniques are applicable to searches for types of information other than text. Therefore, the specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.",
        "In addition, in this description certain process steps are set forth in a particular order, and alphabetic and alphanumeric labels may be used to identify certain steps. Unless specifically stated in the description, embodiments of the invention are not necessarily limited to any particular order of carrying out such steps. In particular, the labels are used merely for convenient identification of steps, and are not intended to specify or require a particular order of carrying out such steps."
