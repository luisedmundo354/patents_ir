        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention generally relates to a wiring method. More specifically, the present invention relates to a wiring method to be performed on a thin film transistor.",
        "2. Background Information",
        "As is well known, a thin-film transistor (hereinafter also referred to as a TFT) has a configuration including an insulating film, a layer on which a drain electrode and a source electrode are formed, and a layer on which a gate electrode. The drain electrode/source electrode layer and the gate electrode layer are disposed on either side of the insulating film. When manufacturing such a thin-film transistor, the insulating film is preferably made thinner in order to improve productivity. However, since such an insulating film fulfills the role of preventing short-circuiting between the drain electrode/source electrode and the gate electrode, reducing the thickness of the insulating film can sometimes result in insufficient insulation between the drain electrode/source electrode and the gate electrode.",
        "Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2002-190598 discloses a technique for resolving such problems. Specifically, the thickness of the gate electrode is reduced by adjusting the gradation of exposure using a so-called gray tone exposure technique, such that the portion of the insulating film on the gate electrode is made relatively thick to secure the requisite thickness of the insulating film between the drain electrode/source electrode and the gate electrode.",
        "Recently a method has been proposed wherein a pattern is formed on a substrate using so-called ink jetting, which is a droplet ejection method for ejecting liquid material in a droplet form from a liquid ejection head. In this method, the liquid material (functional liquid) with which the pattern is to be formed is deposited in the shape of the pattern directly onto the substrate, and is then converted into the pattern using a heat treatment or a laser irradiation. This method has merits in that the need for photolithography is eliminated, the process is greatly simplified, and a lesser amount of raw material is required.",
        "It is preferable to reduce the thickness of the insulating film described above in order to improve the productivity even when a TFT is manufactured by applying such a droplet ejection method to form gate wiring or the like, where part of such gate wiring is also used as a gate electrode. In actuality, among techniques for forming gate wiring or the like using droplet ejection, no technique has yet been proposed that would secure the required thickness of the insulating film formed on the gate electrode while reducing the thickness of the gate electrode.",
        "In view of the above, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that there exists a need for an improved wiring method that overcomes the problems of the conventional art. This invention addresses this need in the art as well as other needs, which will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure.",
        "An object of the present invention is to provide a wiring method that reduces the occurrence of insufficient insulation even when the thickness of the insulation film is reduced.",
        "A method of forming a wiring in a thin-film transistor in accordance with the present invention includes steps of: providing a bank having a groove defined thereon, the groove having a wiring formation area and a secondary area that is contiguously connected with the wiring formation area; placing a liquid material in the wiring formation area by depositing droplets of the liquid material, the liquid material containing a structural material for the wiring; and placing the liquid material in the secondary area, a per unit amount of the liquid material placed in the secondary area being smaller than a per unit amount of the liquid material deposited in the wiring formation area.",
        "These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which, taken in conjunction with the annexed drawings, discloses a preferred embodiment of the present invention.",
        "Referring now to the attached drawings which form a part of this original disclosure:",

        "FIGS. 12(a)-(b) are diagrams for showing the wiring method of the second embodiment of the present invention.",
        "Selected embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the drawings. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that the following descriptions of the embodiments of the present invention are provided for illustration only and not for the purpose of limiting the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.",
        "A method of forming a wiring in a thin-film transistor in accordance with the present invention includes steps of: providing a bank having a groove defined thereon, the groove having a wiring formation area and a secondary area that is contiguously connected with the wiring formation area; placing a liquid material in the wiring formation area by depositing droplets of the liquid material, the liquid material containing a structural material for the wiring; and placing the liquid material in the secondary area, a per unit amount of the liquid material placed in the secondary area being smaller than a per unit amount of the liquid material deposited in the wiring formation area.",
        "According to the wiring method of the present invention, the liquid material in the wiring formation area is smaller in amount than the liquid material in the secondary area. Therefore, the thickness of the insulating film that is formed on the secondary area can be increased relatively as compared to the thickness of the insulating film formed on the wiring formation area. Thus, it is possible to reduce the occurrence of insufficient insulation on the secondary area. Therefore, when a wiring such as gate wiring is formed using the wiring method of the present invention, it is possible to reduce the occurrence of insufficient insulation even when the insulating film is made thinner.",
        "According to the wiring method of the present invention, the wiring method can further include steps of: drying the liquid material in the wiring formation area; and drying the liquid material in the secondary area. A film of the liquid material in the wiring formation area is thicker than a film of the liquid material in the secondary area.",
        "According to the wiring method of the present invention, the wiring formation area can be a gate wiring of the thin film transistor, and the secondary area can be a gate electrode of the thin film transistor.",
        "According to the wiring method of the present invention that employs such configuration, since the gate electrode is made thinner than the gate wiring, it is possible to ensure sufficient thickness in the insulating film on the gate electrode. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the occurrence of insufficient insulation on the gate electrode.",
        "According to the wiring method of the present invention, the secondary area can be an accumulation and storage capacity of the thin film transistor.",
        "According to the wiring method of the present invention, the wiring formation area can also be an accumulation and storage capacity wiring of the thin film transistor.",
        "According to the wiring method of the present invention that employs such configuration, since the accumulation and storage capacity is made thinner than the accumulation and storage capacity wiring, it is possible to ensure sufficient thickness in the insulating film over the accumulation and storage capacity. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the occurrence of insufficient insulation over the accumulation and storage capacity.",
        "According to the wiring method of the present invention, in the placing of the liquid material in the secondary area, the liquid material can be placed in the secondary area by the liquid material deposited in the wiring formation area flowing into the secondary area due to the fluidity of the liquid material.",
        "According to the wiring method of the present invention that employs such configuration, the liquid material flows into the secondary area due to its natural fluidity. Thus, the amount of the liquid material placed in the secondary area is less than the amount of the liquid material placed in the wiring formation area. Therefore, the wiring in the secondary area can be formed to be thin easily by subsequently drying or otherwise treating the liquid material.",
        "According to the wiring method of the present invention, in the placing of the liquid material in the secondary area, the liquid material can be placed in the secondary area by depositing droplets of the liquid material that are smaller than the droplets of the liquid material deposited in the wiring formation area.",
        "According to the wiring method of the present invention that employs such configuration, smaller droplets of the liquid material are deposited into the secondary area than in the wiring formation area. Therefore, the wiring in the secondary area can be easily formed to be thin by subsequently drying or otherwise treating the liquid material.",
        "According to the wiring method of the present invention, the placing of the liquid material in the secondary area can be performed after the drying of the liquid material in the wiring formation area. In the placing of the liquid material in the secondary area, the liquid material can be placed in the secondary area by depositing droplets of the liquid material that are smaller than the droplets of the liquid material deposited in the wiring formation area.",
        "According to the wiring method of the present invention that employs such configuration, smaller droplets of the liquid material are deposited into the secondary area after the droplets deposited into the wiring formation area are dried. When the liquid material is simultaneously deposited into the wiring formation area and the secondary area, there is a possibility that the amount of the liquid material deposited in both areas will be made uniform due to leveling. Therefore, it is preferable, for example, to first deposit the liquid material into the wiring formation area, dry the liquid material, and then deposit the liquid material into the secondary area.",
        "The wiring method of the present invention can further include the step of placing an insulating film over the wiring formation area and the secondary area, a thickness of the insulating film over the wiring formation area being smaller than the thickness of the insulating film over the secondary area.",
        "Embodiments of the wiring method relating to the present invention will now be described with reference to the diagrams. In the following diagrams, the scale of the members and layers has been appropriately modified so that the components and layers can be easily recognized.",
        "The wiring method of the present embodiment is used, for example, to manufacture a thin-film transistor (TFT) as shown in FIG. 1, which is used as a switching element. FIG. 1 is a plan view showing the schematic configuration of a TFT array substrate P.",
        "As shown in FIG. 1, gate wiring 40, source wiring 42, a drain electrode 44, and a pixel electrode 45 electrically connected to the drain electrode 44 are disposed on the TFT array substrate P having a TFT 30. The gate wiring 40 is formed so as to extend in the direction of the X-axis as viewed in FIG. 1, and one part 41 thereof is formed so as to extend in the direction of the Y-axis. The gate wiring 40 has portions that extend in the direction of the Y-axis and are used as gate electrodes 41. The width H2 of the gate electrode 41 is less than the width H1 of the gate wiring 40 in this embodiment. This gate wiring 40 is then formed by the wiring method of the present embodiment. Also, the source wiring 42 has a portion that extends in the direction of the Y-axis and is used as a source electrode 43.",
        "Wiring Method",
        "A method for manufacturing the TFT array substrate P using the wiring method of the present embodiment will now be described with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3.",
        "First Bank Formation Step",
        "First, as shown in FIG. 2(a), a first bank B is formed by photolithography on the top surface of a cleaned glass substrate 610, to allow a groove Ba having the size of 1/20 to 1/10 the size of one pixel pitch to be formed on the first bank B. Since photolithography is well known in the art, detailed explanation thereof will be omitted herein. This bank B must be optically transparent and liquid-repellent when formed. Suitable examples of the material for the bank B include acrylic resins, polyimide resins, olefin resins, melamine resins, and other such polymeric materials.",
        "In order to make the bank B liquid-repellent after it is formed, CF4 plasma treatment (a plasma treatment using a gas with a fluorine component) or the like must be applied. Instead of the plasma treatment, liquid-repellent components (fluorine groups or the like) may instead be filled into the material of the bank B itself in advance. In this case, a separate treatment such as the CF4 plasma treatment or the like that renders liquid repellency can be dispensed with.",
        "The angle of contact of the ejected ink on the bank B that has been made liquid-repellent as described above is preferably kept at 40\u00b0 or greater, and the angle of contact on the glass surface is preferably kept at 10\u00b0 or less. Specifically, the inventors have confirmed as a result of experimentation that, when an acrylic resin was employed as the material for the bank B, the angle of contact of electrically conductive microparticles (tetradecane solvent), for example, was able to be kept at about 54.0\u00b0 when the bank B was rendered liquid repellent, while such contact angle is 10\u00b0 or less when the bank B was not rendered liquid repellent. This angle of contact in the case the bank B was rendered liquid repellent was obtained when plasma treatment was performed under conditions of supplying methane tetrafluoride gas at a rate of 0.1 L/min with 550 W of plasma power.",
        "Gate Wiring Step",
        "In the gate wiring step, which follows the first bank formation step, droplets containing a gate wiring material are ejected according to a droplet ejection method to form the gate wiring 40 (gate electrode 41) so as to fill in the groove Ba. The groove Ba is a drawing area defined by the bank B. The wiring method of the present embodiment is applied when the gate wiring 40 is formed.",
        "Specifically, first, as shown in FIG. 3(a), droplets of a functional liquid L (liquid material) containing the gate wiring material are deposited by a droplet ejection method onto specific locations along a gate wiring formation area Ba1 (an example of the wiring formation area) that extends in the direction of the X-axis. When the droplets of the functional liquid L are deposited onto the gate wiring formation area Ba1, the droplets are ejected onto the gate wiring formation area Ba1 from above the gate wiring formation area Ba1 using a droplet ejection method. In the present embodiment, as shown in FIG. 3(a), droplets of the functional liquid L are deposited at specific intervals along the direction in which the gate wiring formation area Ba1 extends (the X-axis direction). At this time, the droplets of the functional liquid L are also deposited in the vicinity of a connecting area 37 (intersecting area) where the gate wiring formation area Ba1 and a gate electrode formation area Ba2 (an example of the secondary area) are contiguously connected to one another.",
        "As shown in FIG. 3(b), the functional liquid L deposited in the gate wiring formation area Ba1 expands within the gate wiring formation area Ba1 due to the natural fluidity of the functional liquid L. Furthermore, the functional liquid L deposited on the gate wiring formation area Ba1 also expands in the gate electrode formation area Ba2 due to the natural fluidity. The functional liquid L is thereby also deposited in the gate electrode formation area Ba2 without droplets being ejected directly onto the gate electrode formation area Ba2 from above the gate electrode formation area Ba2.",
        "Thus, by being deposited on the gate wiring formation area Ba1, the functional liquid L can also be disposed on the gate electrode formation area Ba2 due to the natural fluidity (capillary phenomenon) of the functional liquid L that is deposited on the gate wiring formation area Ba1.",
        "The amount of the functional liquid L that is deposited on the gate electrode formation area Ba2 through the flow from the gate wiring formation area Ba1 as a result of the natural fluidity is less than the amount of the functional liquid L deposited on the gate wiring formation area Ba1. Therefore, the thickness of the liquid film formed on the gate electrode formation area Ba2 is less than the thickness of the liquid film formed on the gate wiring formation area Ba1.",
        "Examples of materials that can be employed as the gate wiring material (structural material) contained in the functional liquid L include Ag, Al, Au, Cu, palladium, Ni, W\u2014si, electrically conductive polymers, and the like. Also, since the bank B is sufficiently liquid-repellent, the functional liquid L can be deposited being spilled from the groove Ba.",
        "After the functional liquid L is deposited onto the glass substrate 610, an intermediate drying treatment is performed as necessary to remove the dispersion solvent and to ensure film thickness. The drying treatment can be performed, for example, by using a regular hot plate, electric furnace, or other device to heat the glass substrate 610, or by lamp annealing.",
        "The light source used in lamp annealing is not particularly limited. Possible examples of suitable light sources include an infrared lamp, a xenon lamp, a YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) laser, an argon laser, a carbonate gas laser, or an excimer laser that uses XeF, XeCl, XeBr, KrF, KrCl, ArF, ArCl, or the like. These light sources commonly have an output of equal to or greater than 10 W to equal to or lower than 5000 W. For the present embodiment, the light sources of 100 W to 1000 W suffice.",
        "The intermediately dried film must have the dispersion solvent completely removed in order to ensure a good electrical connection between microparticles. Also, when the surface of the conductive microparticles is coated with an organic or other such coating material to improve dispersion, such coating material must also be removed. Therefore, the glass substrate 610 is subjected to a heat and/or light treatment after the ejection step.",
        "The heat treatment and the light treatment are commonly performed in the atmosphere, but can also be performed in the presence of inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, and helium, as necessary. The temperature of the heat treatment and/or light treatment is appropriately determined in view of the boiling point of the dispersion solvent (vapor pressure), the type and the pressure of the atmospheric gas, the thermal behavior of the microparticles, such as the dispersibility and the propensity toward oxidation, the presence or absence and the quantity of the coating material, the upper limit of the heat resistance of the substrate, and the like.",
        "For example, in order to remove a coating material composed of organic matter, the substrate must be baked at about 300\u00b0 C. In this case, for example, the top of the bank B and the dried film of the functional liquid L may be coated in advance with a low-melting point glass.",
        "Also, when the substrate is made of a plastic or other such material, the temperature of the heating treatment is preferably between the room temperature and about equal to or lower than 100\u00b0 C.",
        "In this manner, the dried film after the ejection maintains electrical connection between the microparticles, and is converted to the gate wiring 40 (gate electrode 41) as shown in FIG. 2(a).",
        "The gate electrode 41 that is part of the gate wiring 40 thus formed has a thickness that is thinner than that of the rest of the gate wiring 40. More specifically, the per unit area amount of the functional liquid L deposited on the gate electrode formation area Ba2 by flow of the function liquid L into the gate electrode formation area Ba2 due the natural fluidity as described above is smaller than the per unit area amount of the functional liquid L deposited on the gate wiring formation area Ba1. Accordingly, the thickness of the gate electrode 41 obtained by subjecting the functional liquid L to the intermediate drying treatment and the heating treatment and/or the light treatment is smaller than the thickness of the rest of the gate wiring 40. Therefore, according to the wiring method of the present embodiment, the top surface of the gate electrode 41 is positioned lower than the top surface of the gate wiring 40. Particularly, if the top surface of the gate wiring 40 is formed to be at the same level as the top surface of the bank B, the top surface of the gate electrode 41 is formed to be lower than the top surface of the bank B, as shown in FIG. 2(a).",

        "Next, as shown in FIG. 2(b), a gate insulating film 613 (insulating film), an active layer 611, and a contact layer 609 are formed continuously using the plasma CVD method. A silicon nitride film is used to form the gate insulating film 613, an amorphous silicon film is used to form the active layer 611, and an n+-type silicon film is used to form the contact layer 609 by varying the raw material gas and plasma conditions. When these films are formed by CVD, a heat history of 300\u00b0 C. to 350\u00b0 C. is required. Although heat history of such low temperature generally tends to cause transparency problems and heat-resistance problems, it is possible to avoid such problems by including silicon as a primary component in the principal chains of the basic framework of these films, while using a silica glass-based material having a structure of hydrogen carbide or the like in the side chains.",
        "The gate electrode 41 herein is formed to be thinner than the other part of the gate wiring 40 as described above. As a result, a thicker insulating film 613 is formed on the gate electrode 41 than on the rest of the gate wiring 40, as shown in FIG. 2(b).",
        "Second Bank Formation Step",
        "In the second bank formation step, which follows the semiconductor layer formation step described above, the contact layer 609 is etched in advance to secure a channel. Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 2(c), a second bank 614 for providing a groove 614a having the size of 1/20 to 1/10 the size of one pixel pitch is formed by photolithography on the top surface of the gate insulating film 613. This second bank 614 must be optically transparent and liquid-repellent when formed. Suitable examples for the material of the second bank 614 include acrylic resins, polyimide resins, olefin resins, melamine resins, and other such polymeric materials.",
        "In order to make the second bank 614 liquid-repellent, CF4 plasma treatment (a plasma treatment using a gas with a fluorine component) or the like must be applied. Instead of the plasma treatment, liquid-repellent components (fluorine groups or the like) may instead be filled into the material of the second bank 614 itself in advance. In this case, a separate treatment such as the CF4 plasma treatment or the like that renders liquid repellency can be dispensed with.",
        "The angle of contact of the ejected ink on the second bank 614 that has been rendered liquid-repellent as described above should be preferably kept at 40\u00b0 or greater.",
        "Source Wiring Step",
        "In the source wiring step, which follows the second bank formation step, droplets containing a source wiring material are ejected by a droplet ejection method so as to fill in the groove 614a, which is a drawing area defined by the second bank 614. Then, an intermediate drying treatment and a heat treatment and/or a light treatment are applied to form a source wiring 42 that intersects with the gate wiring 40, as shown in FIG. 2(d).",
        "Examples of suitable electrically conductive materials from which the source wiring 42 is to be formed include Ag, Al, Au, Cu, palladium, Ni, W\u2014si, conductive polymers, and the like. It is possible to use the resulting source electrode 43 and the drain electrode 44 to form a precise wiring pattern without the materials spilling out of the second bank 614a, because the second bank 614 is made sufficiently liquid-repellent in advance.",
        "Also, insulating material 617 is deposited so as to fill in the groove 614a in which the source electrode 43 and the drain electrode 44 are disposed. As a result of the steps described above, a flat top surface 620 including the top surface of the bank 614 and the top surface of the insulating material 617 is formed over the substrate 610.",
        "Thereafter, a contact hole 619 is formed in the insulating material 617, a patterned pixel electrode (made of Indium Tin Oxide or ITO) 618 is formed on the top surface 620, and the drain electrode 44 and the pixel electrode 618 are connected via the contact hole 619. In this manner, the TFT array substrate P on which a TFT is formed is manufactured.",
        "Thus, in the TFT array substrate P having a gate wiring 40 that is formed using the wiring method of the first embodiment, the gate electrode 41 is formed to be thinner than the rest of the gate wiring 40. Therefore, the thickness of the gate insulating film 613 on the gate electrode 41 is greater than the thickness of the insulating film 613 disposed on the rest of the gate wiring 40. It is therefore possible to reduce the occurrence of insufficient insulation between the source electrode 43 or drain electrode 44 and the gate electrode 41, even when the insulating film is made thinner in order to improve the productivity of the TFT array substrate P.",
        "Also, according to the wiring method of the first embodiment, the liquid film that forms on the gate electrode formation area Ba2 can easily be made thinner than the liquid film disposed on the gate wiring formation area Ba1 by allowing the liquid film to flow naturally into the gate electrode formation area Ba2 due to its natural fluidity. Therefore, a thinner gate electrode 41 can be easily formed by subjecting the functional liquid L to an intermediate drying treatment as well as a heating treatment and/or a light treatment.",
        "Possible examples of the ejection technique for the droplet ejection method include a charge control system, a pressurized vibration system, an electromechanical conversion system, a thermoelectric conversion system, an electrostatic attraction system, and the like. The charge control system involves applying an electric charge to a material with an electric charge electrode and ejecting the material from nozzles while controlling the spraying direction of the material with a deflecting electrode. In the pressurized vibration system, an extremely high pressure of about 30 kg/cm2 is applied to the material to be ejected from the distal ends of the nozzles, wherein the material is ejected from the nozzles in a rectilinear fashion when the controlled voltage is not applied to the material, while the material is scattered but not ejected from the nozzles due an electrostatic repulsion between particles of the material when the controlled voltage is applied to the material. Also, the electromechanical conversion system utilizes a piezoelement (piezoelectric element) that has the property of deforming upon receiving a pulsed electrical signal. The material is ejected when the deformation of the piezoelectric element applies pressure via a flexible substance to the space in which the material is contained and the material is pushed out of the space.",
        "In the thermoelectric conversion system, the material is rapidly gasified to create bubbles by a heater provided in the space where the material is contained, and the material in the space is ejected due to the pressure from the bubbles. In the electrostatic attraction system, a small amount of pressure is applied to the space where the material is contained, a meniscus of the material is formed in the nozzles, and in this state the electrostatic attraction is applied to draw out the material. Other techniques can also be applied, including a system of utilizing changes in the viscosity of the fluid by way of an electric field, a system of spraying by discharge sparks, and the like. Droplet ejection methods have advantages in that there is relatively less amount of material that is wasted during use, and a desired amount of material can be accurately deposited at a desired location. The mass of one droplet of liquid material (fluid) ejected by droplet ejection methods is 1 to 300 nanograms, for example.",

Therefore, the ejection nozzles of the droplet ejection head 1 are aligned at a predetermined interval in the Y-axis direction, which is the non-scanning direction. In FIG. 4, the droplet ejection head 1 is disposed at a right angle relative to the direction in which the substrate P advances. However, the angle of the droplet ejection head 1 may be adjusted to an angle that intersects with the advancement direction of the substrate P.
