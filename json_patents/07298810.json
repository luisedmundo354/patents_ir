    "abstract": "A programmable frequency divider for dividing the frequency of a source signal according to a selectable divisor which is obtained based on a plurality of divisor signals and outputting a result signal having a divided frequency includes at least one cell of a first type. The cells of the first type are cascaded with each other. The programmable frequency divider synchronously resets all of the cells of the first type according to a reset signal in order to selectively switch each cell of the first type to perform a divide-by-two or divide-by-three operation according to a corresponding divisor signal. The last cell of the first type outputs the result signal having the divided frequency.",

        "The present invention relates to a frequency divider, and more particularly, to a programmable frequency divider.",
        "A frequency divider is a very important component of a frequency synthesizer and is used for dividing a source signal to form a result signal. The frequency of the result signal is the frequency of the source signal being divided with a divisor. As is known in the art, a conventional frequency divider is composed of a plurality of cascaded dual mode dividing cells. Each cell of the frequency divider performs a dividing operation according a corresponding divisor signal. The division range depends on the number of cells of the frequency divider. The more cells that are used, the wider the division range. A \u2154 cell having two dividing modes, which are divide-by-two and divide-by-three modes, is a commonly used dividing cell. If the frequency divider is composed of N \u2154 cells, the division range of the frequency divider is all integers from 2N to 2N+1\u22121.",
        "Employing more cells in the frequency divider can extend the division range; however, it deteriorates space efficiency for IC design. U.S. Pat. No. 5,349,622 discloses a programmable frequency divider with a prescaler and a programmable counter. Adjusting the counter value of the programmable counter extends the division range of the frequency divider. The complexity of circuit design and cost, however, are increased due to the utilization of the programmable counter.",
        "In other applications, such as a fractional frequency divider in a frequency synthesizer, the programmed divisor repeatedly changes from a value of M to a value of M+1, then back to M in order to obtain a result signal at a fractional frequency. However, if the divisor changes, i.e. a set of divisor signals are loaded while one or more of the dividing cells is sensitive to the divisor signal, the cells sensitive to the divisor signals are enabled to perform divide-by-two or divide-by-three operations according to the corresponding divisor signals. Therefore, some cells of the programmable frequency divider operate depending upon the divisor signals and the other cells operate depending upon the original divisor signals. The effective division may thereby result an incorrect value, i.e. the effective division may be a value that is neither M nor M+1.",
        "It is therefore an objective of the claimed invention to provide a programmable frequency divider to guarantee the correctness of the frequency of the output signal of the programmable frequency divider by resetting dividing cells of the programmable frequency divider.",
        "According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a method for changing divisors in a programmable frequency divider is disclosed. Wherein the frequency divider has a plurality of cascaded cells, and the method involves: providing a plurality of divisor signals; selectively switching each of the plurality of cells to a divide-by-two or a divide-by-three mode according to the plurality of divisor signals; and synchronously resetting at least a part of the plurality of cells.",
        "The programmable frequency divider of the present invention synchronously resets the plurality of cells after the divisor is changed so that each cell renews its dividing operation.",
        "In another embodiment of the present invention, the programmable frequency divider further utilizes a reload signal to trigger each cell to synchronously reload a corresponding divisor signal in order to guarantee that each cell performs dividing operations according to the corresponding signal after the divisor is changed. The output signal of the programmable frequency divider can be employed to be the reload signal to simplify circuit design.",
        "In addition, the programmable frequency divider of the present invention is capable of extending the division range by simply utilizing flip-flops and simple logic gates to add a bypass mode to the two-mode dividing cells.",
        "According to a preferred embodiment, the programmable frequency divider of the present invention needs to only synchronously reload each of the cells having bypass mode with a corresponding divisor signal in order to simultaneously extend the division range and guarantee the correctness of the frequency of the frequency-divided signal.",
        "One advantage of the present invention is that the division range is extended by utilizing simple flip-flops and logic gates and without any programmable counter.",
        "Another advantage of the present invention is that the programmable frequency divider is capable of ensuring correctness of the frequency of the output signal by resetting cells.",
        "Yet another advantage is that the cells are modularized according to the present invention, so that the circuit design complexity and cost are thereby reduced.",

The programmable frequency divider 100 comprises N cascaded dividing cells 10, each cell 10 has a first input node (Fi), a second input node (Mi), a third input node (Di), a fourth input node (Rs), a first output node (Fo), and a second output node (Mo). According to the cascading sequence, those cells 10 of FIG. 1 are respectively defined from left to right as a first stage cell 10, a second stage cell 10, . . . , and an Nth stage cell 10.",
        "In the first embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 1, from the first stage to the (N\u22121)th stage, the first output node (Fo) of each cell 10 is coupled to the first input node (Fi) of next stage cell 10 and the second input node (Mi) of each cell 10 is coupled to the second output node (Mo) of next stage cell 10. The second input node (Mi) of the Nth stage cell 10 is coupled to a last divisor signal Di<N+1> that is typically a fixed logic value in this embodiment. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the second input node (Mi) of the Nth stage cell 10 is coupled to logic 1, (e.g. coupled to Vcc), which means the last divisor signal Di<N+1> is at logic 1. The third input node (Di) of each cell 10 is used for receiving a corresponding divisor signal Di<P>, (where 1\u2266P\u2266N). And the fourth input node (Rs) is used for receiving a reset signal to synchronously reset the Pth stage cell 10. The reset signal is usually generated from a control circuit (not shown). Each cell 10 operates in a divide-by-two mode or a divide-by-three mode respectively according to the logic level at its third input node (Di). A more detailed operation will be discussed later.",
        "In the first embodiment of the present invention, a source signal Fin is input into the first input node (Fi) of the first stage cell 10 of the programmable frequency divider 100. Each cell 10 processes the source signal Fin according to its dividing mode. After the source signal Fin is sequentially processed by all cells 10, a result signal Fout at a divided frequency is thereby output from the second output node (Mo) or the first output node (Fo) of the Nth stage (the last stage) cell 10. A programmable divisor value, which is obtained based on the divisor signals, determines the ratio of the frequency of the result signal Fout to the frequency of the source signal Fin. The programmable divisor value is presented as a set of binary divisor signals, Di<P>, 1\u2266P\u2266N+1, and each binary divisor signal Di<P>, is loaded to the third input node (Di) of the corresponding Pth stage cell 10 for 1\u2266P\u2266N. Once the divisor value changes, the reset signal is employed to reset all cells 10 after each cell 10 receives the new value of the corresponding divisor signal, so that each cell 10 refreshes its dividing operation after being reset. Thus, the frequency of the result signal Fout output from the programmable frequency divider 100 is thereby guaranteed to be the result of the frequency of the source signal Fin divided with the new divisor value.",
        "FIG. 2 depicts a circuit diagram according to one embodiment of the cell 10 of FIG. 1. As shown in FIG. 2, regardless of the logic level of the second input node (Mi), if the first output node (Fo) is at logic 0 and the third input node (Di) is also at logic 0, this makes the cell 10 operate in the divide-by-two mode. In the divided-by-two mode, the positive edge of a clock signal at the first input node (Fi) triggers flip-flops 2 and 4 such that the first output node (Fo) outputs a half frequency signal. In other words, the signal at the first output node (Fo) has a frequency half of that of the clock signal at the first input node (Fi).",
        "If the second input node (Mi) and the third input node (Di) are both at logic 1 and the first output node (Fo) is at logic 0, this makes the cell 10 operate in the divide-by-three mode. In the divided-by-three mode, the positive edge of the clock signal at the first input node (Fi) triggers flip-flops 2 and 4 such that the first output node (Fo) outputs a one-third-frequency signal. In other words, the signal at the first output node (Fo) has a frequency one-third of that of the clock signal at the first input node (Fi).",
        "If the first output node (Fo) is at logic 0, the second output node (Mo) outputs a signal at the same logic level as the second input node (Mi). In addition, regardless of the logic level of the second input node (Mi), if the first output node (Fo) is at logic 1, the second output node (Mo) outputs a logic 0 signal. Furthermore, if the reset signal received on the fourth input node (Rs) is at an active state (i.e. is enabled), such as the logic 1 of the example embodiment, the flip-flops 2 and 4 are both at reset state such that the cell 10 does not perform a dividing operation and the first output node (Fo) outputs a logic 0 signal. Additionally, when the reset signal is enabled, if the second input node (Mi) is at logic 1, the second output node (Mo) outputs a logic 1 signal. After reset is disabled, e.g., the reset signal returns to logic 0 level, the cell 10 renews its dividing operation.",
        "In other words, according to the circuit diagram 12, regardless of the logic level of the second output node (Mo), if the third input node (Di) is at logic 0, this means the cell 10 will operate in the divide-by-two mode. The positive edge of the clock signal at the first input node (Fi) triggers the first output node (Fo) to output the half frequency signal. If the second output node (Mo) and the third input node (Di) are both at logic 1, this means the cell 10 will operate in the divide-by-three mode. The positive edge of the clock signal of the first input node (Fi) triggers the first output node (Fo) to output the one-third-frequency signal.",
        "From the above illustration of the circuit diagram 12, it is known that the operating clock of the cell 10 is the signal received at the first input node (Fi). Regarding to the first stage cell 10 shown in FIG. 1, for example, the operating clock is the source signal Fin received at the first input node (Fi) thereof. In the first embodiment of the present invention, the operating clock of the cells 10 of the programmable frequency divider 100 is sequentially delivered from the first stage to the last stage (the Nth stage) and a division cycle is thereby completed.",

        "Please refer to FIG. 11 as well as to FIG. 8. FIG. 11 depicts a timing diagram of the programmable frequency divider 400 of FIG. 8. In FIG. 11, for convenience of description, it assumed that the programmable frequency divider 400 has six stages of cells 30. In this embodiment, since the second input node (Mi) of the last stage (i.e. the sixth stage) cell 30 is coupled to Vcc and is thereby always at logic 1 level, i.e., the last divisor signal Di<7> is a logic 1. Accordingly, the smallest divisor value of the programmable frequency divider 400 is 64 (26=64) in this embodiment. As shown in the timing diagram 450, regardless of the original operation mode of each cell 30, all cells 30 are synchronously reset and stop dividing operations while the reset signal is enabled during time 452 through time 454. During this period, the signal output from the first output node (Fo) of each cell 30, respectively denoted by 1-Fo, 2-Fo, 3-Fo, 4-Fo, 5-Fo, and 6-Fo, becomes logic 0.",
        "As mentioned above, during the period from time 452 through time 454, because of the second input node (Mi) of the last stage cell 30 is at logic 1, its second output node (Mo) outputs logic 1 signal during the period accordingly. In addition, since the second output node (Mo) of each stage is connected to the second input node (Mi) of its previous stage, the signal output from the second output node (Mo) of each stage, respectively denoted by 1-Mo, 2-Mo, 3-Mo, 4-Mo, 5-Mo, and 6-Mo, becomes logic 1.",
        "At time 454, the reset signal becomes disabled (i.e., falls to logic 0), which means all cells 30 have been synchronously reset, so each cell 30 renews its operation according to the divisor signal loaded when reset. In FIG. 11, all divisor signals loaded to all cells 30 are assumed logic 0 and all cells thereby will perform the divide-by-two operation. Accordingly, the divisor of the programmable frequency divider 400 is 64. At time 454, since a rising edge of the source signal Fin (i.e., the signal 1-Fi input into the first input node (Fi) of the first stage cell 30) occurs, the first stage cell 30 operates in the divide-by-two mode and outputs a frequency-divided signal 1-Fo from its first output node (Fo). The signal 1-Fo is also the operating clock of the second stage cell 30, 2-Fi. A rising edge of the operating clock 2-Fi triggers the second stage cell 30 to perform dividing operation. The second stage cell 30 then outputs a frequency-divided signal 2-Fo from its first output node (Fo) to be the operating clock of the third stage cell 30, 3-Fi. By this way, the Pth stage cell 30 outputs a frequency-divided signal P-Fo from its first output node (Fo) to be the operating clock of the (P+1)th stage cell 30, (P+1)-Fi. Finally, at time 458, the programmable frequency divider 400 completes the first division cycle after reset. The signal output from the second output node (Mo) of the final stage, 6-Mo, is employed to be the result signal Fout. The frequency of the result signal Fout is 1/64 of the frequency of the source signal Fin. If using the signal output from the first output node (Fo) of the last stage cell to be the result signal Fout, the frequency of the result signal Fout is also 1/64 of the frequency of the source signal Fin.",
        "As mentioned above, the signal output from the second output node (Mo) of the last stage cell 30, 6-Mo, is also employed to be the reload signal of the programmable frequency divider 400. In the timing diagram 450, the divisor signals received on the third input node (Di) of each cell 30 are logic 0 at time 456. After a rising edge of the signal 6-Mo triggers each cell 30 to reload a corresponding divisor signal, the divisor of the programmable frequency divider 400 remains at 64. Accordingly, each cell 30 repeats the divide-by-two operation in a next division cycle. Therefore, the frequency of the result signal Fout (6-Mo) is still 1/64 of the frequency of the source signal Fin.",
        "As shown in FIG. 11, the signals output from the second output node (Mo) of each stage, 1-Mo, 2-Mo, 3-Mo, 4-Mo, 5-Mo, and 6-Mo, are periodic signals with identical period and only differ in pulse width. So it is also feasible to use any of these signals as the result signal Fout of the programmable frequency divider 400. In practical implementations, an advantage of using the signal 6-Mo output from the last stage cell 30 as the reload signal is that the signal 6-Mo has a wider pulse width than the others (i.e., 1-Mo, 2-Mo, 3-Mo, 4-Mo, and 5-Mo). This feature is helpful to reduce the requirement of detecting high frequency signal for the cell 30 and the cost of the programmable frequency divider is thereby reduced.",

The programmable frequency divider 500 divides the frequency of a source signal Fin received on the first input node (Fi) of the first stage cell 30 according to the divisor value. In the previous embodiments, if N cells are employed, since the last divisor signal (D<N+1>) is at logic 1 level, the allowable divisors are integers from 2N to 2N+1\u22121.

The second input node (Mi) is coupled to Vcc (i.e., logic 1 level); the third input node (Di) and the sixth input node (Ci) is coupled to the last two divisor signals Di<6> and Di<7>, respectively. In the circuit diagram 42, when the reload signal on the fifth input node (Rl) triggers the cell 40, the divisor signals Di<6> on the third input node (Di) and the Di<7> on the sixth input node (Ci) are synchronously loaded into the cell 40. At that moment, if the last divisor Di<7> is at logic 0, a flip-flop 132 outputs a logic 0 signal. A NOT gate 142 then converts the logic 0 signal into a logic 1 signal. Next, the logic 1 signal is transmitted into an OR gate 152, so that the output of the OR gate 152 is thereby maintained in logic 1 level to reset flip-flops 134 and 136. Obviously, regardless of the value of the divisor signal Di<6> on the third input node (Di) of the cell 40, the cell 40 does not perform any dividing operation, i.e., it is at the so-called bypass state.

Similarly, in FIG. 13, when the sixth input node (Ci) of the circuit diagram 42 receives a logic 0 signal, i.e., the bypass-mode enabling signal is at an active state, the flip-flops 134 and 136 are both at the reset state so that the cell 40 does not perform any dividing operation. Thus, when the sixth input node (Ci) of the cell 40 loaded with a logic 0 signal, the cell 40 is bypassed and can be regarded as in the reset state.",
        "In addition, when the reload signal on the fifth input node (Rl) triggers the cell 40, if the divisor signals Di<6>, and Di<7> loaded into the cell 40 are both at logic 0, an OR gate 154 outputs a logic 0 signal. The logic 0 signal is then output from the third output node (Co) of the cell 40 to the sixth input node (Ci) of the previous stage (the fifth stage) to bypass the previous stage.",
        "Please refer to FIG. 15, which depicts a circuit diagram 52 according to one embodiment of the cell 50 of FIG. 12. In the circuit diagram 52, when the signal received on the sixth input node (Ci) is at logic 0, similar with the circuit diagram 42 of FIG. 13, a NOT gate 242 converts the logic 0 signal into a logic 1 signal. The logic 1 signal is then transmitted to an OR gate 252. Next, the OR gate 252 outputs a logic 1 signal to reset flip-flops 232 and 234. At that moment, the cell 50 is bypassed and does not perform any dividing operation. Similarly, in the circuit diagram 52, if the signals on the sixth input node (Ci) and the loaded signal from the third input node (Di) are both at logic 0, an OR gate 254 outputs a logic 0 signal. The logic 0 signal is then transmitted from the third output node (Co) of the cell 50 to the sixth input node (Ci) of a previous stage to bypass the previous stage.",
        "Regarding the above illustration of the circuit diagrams 42 and 52, a conclusion is obtained as follows: in the fifth embodiment of the present invention, when the loaded signals respectively from the last two divisor signals Di<6>, and Di<7>, are both at logic 0, the cell 40 and the fifth stage cell 50 of the programmable frequency divider 500 are both bypassed. Furthermore, when the divisor signals Di<5>, Di<6>, and Di<7>that have been loaded are all at logic 0, the cell 40, the fourth stage cell 50 and the fifth stage cell 50 are all bypassed. Thus, the division range of the programmable frequency divider 500 can be extended by properly setting the divisor signals Di<1>, Di<2>, Di<3>, . . . , and Di<7>.",
        "For example, if the sequence of values of the divisor signals Di<7>, Di<6>, Di<5>, . . . , and Di<1>is 0001000, which is the binary value of 8, this means the divisor value is 8. If the sequence of values of the divisor signals Di<7>, Di<6>, Di<5>, . . . , and Di<1> is 0001001, which is the binary value of 9, this means the divisor value is 9. If the sequence of values of the divisor signals Di<7>, Di<6>, Di<5>, . . . , and Di<1> is 0111111, this means the divisor value is 63. If the sequence of values of the divisor signals Di<7>, Di<6>, Di<5>, . . . , and Di<1> is 1000000, this means the divisor value is 64. If the sequence of values of the divisor signals Di<7>, Di<6>, Di<5>, . . . , and Di<1> is 1111111, this means the divisor value is 127.",
        "In the fifth embodiment shown in FIG. 12, since the last three stages of the programmable frequency divider 500 is possibly bypassed, the signal, 3-Mo, output from the second output node (Mo) of the third stage cell 30 is employed as the result signal Fout.",
        "In contrast to the programmable frequency divider 400 of FIG. 8, the programmable frequency divider 500 is also capable of synchronously resetting all cells, so that each cell renews its operation after reset. The programmable frequency divider 500 also utilizes the result signal Fout as the reload signal to trigger each cell to synchronously reload a corresponding divisor signal. The difference between the programmable frequency divider 500 and the programmable frequency divider 400 is that the cell 40 and cell 50, which have a bypass mode, are employed in the programmable frequency divider 500, so that the programmable frequency divider 500 is capable of extending the division range by programming the divisor signals.",
        "Please refer back to FIG. 13, as well as to FIG. 9 and FIG. 15. The circuit diagram 42 shown in FIG. 13 is similar with both the circuit diagram 52 of FIG. 15 and the circuit diagram 32 of FIG. 9. The difference is that the circuit diagram 52 utilizes four more logic gates (three OR gates 252, 254, 256, and one NOT gate 242) than the circuit diagram 32, and the circuit diagram 42 further utilizes four more elements (one flip-flop 132, one NOT gate 144, and two AND gates 162 and 164) than the circuit diagram 52. Accordingly, one advantage of the fifth embodiment of the present invention is that only some flip-flops and simple logic gates are required for adding a bypass mode to the original cell in order to extend the division range of the programmable frequency divider.",
        "Note that, six cells employed in the programmable frequency divider 500 is just an example for convenience of illustration. In practical implementations, the number of cells employed in the programmable frequency divider is not necessarily limited to six, and any number of employed cells should also be included in the embodiment.",

In contrast to the circuit diagram 42 shown in FIG. 13, obviously, one more AND gate 166 is employed in the circuit diagram 44 to improve output speed of the second output node (Mo). The logical operation of the circuit diagram 44 is substantially the same as the circuit diagram 42 and further details are therefore omitted here.",

In contrast to the circuit diagram 52 of FIG. 15, one more AND gate 262 is employed in the circuit diagram 54. Similarly, it improves output speed of the second output node (Mo) of the circuit diagram 54. The logical operation of the circuit diagram 54 is substantially the same as the circuit diagram 52 and further details are therefore omitted here.",
        "Please refer to FIG. 17, which depicts a schematic diagram of a programmable frequency divider 600 according to the sixth embodiment of the present invention. As an example, the programmable frequency divider 600 comprises three cells 60, one cell 70, and two cells 80. Each of the three cells 60 are cascaded with each other and are respectively defined from left to right as a first stage cell 60, a second stage cell 60, and a third stage cell 60. The two cells 80 are respectively defined from left to right as a fourth stage cell 80 and a fifth stage cell 80, wherein the fourth stage cell 80 is cascaded with the third stage cell 60 and the fifth stage cell 80 is cascaded with the fourth stage cell 80. In addition, the cell 70 is cascaded with the fifth stage cell 80.",
        "As shown in FIG. 17, each cell 60 has a first input node (Fi), a second input node (Mi), a third input node (Di), a first output node (Fo), and a second output node (Mo). Each of the cells 80 and 70 has a first input node (Fi), a second input node (Mi), a third input node (Di), a fourth input node (Rl), a fifth input node (Ci), a first output node (Fo), a second output node (Mo), and a third output node (Co). For each of the first five stages, the first output node (Fo) is coupled to the first input node (Fi) of the next stage, and the second input node (Mi) is coupled to the second output node (Mo) of the next stage. For each cell 80, the fifth input node (Ci) is coupled to the third output node (Co) of the next stage. The first input node (Fi) of the first stage cell 60 is coupled to the source signal Fin. The second input node (Mi) of the cell 70 is coupled to logic 1, e.g. Vcc. The third input node (Di) of each cell is coupled to a corresponding divisor signal Di<N> (1\u2266N\u22666). The fifth input node (Ci) of the cell 70 is coupled to the last divisor signal Di<7>. In addition, for each cell from the fourth stage to the sixth stage, the fourth input node (Rl) is coupled to the second output node (Mo) of the third stage cell 60. The signal, denoted by 3\u2032-Mo, output from the third stage cell 60 is employed as a reload signal.",
        "In this embodiment, a source signal Fin is input into the first input node (Fi) of the first stage cell 60 of the programmable frequency divider 600. Each stage processes the source signal Fin, a result signal Fout at a divided frequency is then output from the second output node (Mo) of the third stage cell 60, i.e., the signal 3\u2032-Mo is employed as the result signal Fout. Each stage performs a divide-by-two or a divide-by-three operation depending upon the corresponding loaded divisor signal from the third input node (Di). For each of the fourth through the sixth stages, the signal received on the fifth input node (Ci), i.e., the bypass-mode enabling signal, determines whether the cell should be bypassed or not.",
        "Therefore, the division range of the programmable frequency divider 600 is also the integers from 8 to 127 similar to the fifth embodiment of the present invention. However, the difference is that the sixth embodiment of the present invention only needs to trigger the cells having the bypass mode (such as cells 70 and 80) to synchronously reload the corresponding divisor signal instead of to trigger all cells. Additionally, in the sixth embodiment, when the cell having the bypass mode is bypassed (i.e., when the signal received on its fifth input node (Ci) is at logic 0 state), the cell is simultaneously reset. Thus, the sixth embodiment does not require utilizing an additional reset signal to synchronously reset the cells and the complexity and cost is thereby reduced. The architecture of each cell of the sixth embodiment is discussed as follows.",
        "Please refer to FIG. 18 and FIG. 19 depicting two embodiments of the cell 60 of FIG. 17, which are shown as circuit diagram 62 and circuit diagram 64. The logical operation of the two circuit diagrams 62 and 64 is discussed as follows. In the circuit diagram 62, for example, regardless of the logic level of the second input node (Mi), if the first output node (Fo) is at logic 0 level and the third input node (Di) is at logic 0 level, this means the cell 60 will operate in a divide-by-two mode. Accordingly, the positive edge of a clock signal of the first input node (Fi) triggers the first output node (Fo) to output a half frequency signal. If the second input node (Mi) is at logic 1, the first output node (Fo) is at logic 0, and the third input node (Di) is at logic 1, this means the cell 60 will perform a divide-by-three operation. Thus, the positive edge of a clock signal of the first input node (Fi) triggers the first output node (Fo) to output a one-third-frequency signal. In other words, regardless of the logic level of the second output node (Mo), if the third input node (Di) is at logic 0, this means the cell 60 will perform a divide-by-two operation. Similarly, the positive edge of a clock signal of the first input node (Fi) triggers the first output node (Fo) to output a half frequency signal. If the second output node (Mo) and the third input node (Di) are both at logic 1, this means the cell 60 will operate in a divide-by-three mode. Therefore, the positive edge of the clock signal of the first input node (Fi) triggers the first output node (Fo) to output a one-third-frequency signal.",
        "If the first output node (Fo) is at logic 0, the second output node (Mo) outputs a signal at the same logic level as the second input node (Mi). In addition, regardless of the logic level of the second input node (Mi), if the first output node (Fo) is at logic 1, the second output node (Mo) outputs a logic 0 signal.",
        "The difference between the circuit diagram 64 shown in FIG. 19 and the circuit diagram 62 shown in FIG. 18 is that one more OR gate is employed in the circuit diagram 64 in order to improve the output speed of the second output node (Mo) thereof. The logical operation of the circuit diagram 64 is substantially the same as the circuit diagram 62 and therefore further details are omitted here.",

The circuit diagram 72 is very similar with the circuit diagram 74. The only difference is one more AND gate 762 is employed in the circuit diagram 74 to improve the output speed of the second output node (Mo) thereof. Since the logical operation of the circuit diagram 72 is substantially the same as the circuit diagram 74, the circuit diagram 72 is used as an example in following illustrations.",

In contrast to the circuit diagram 62, the circuit diagram 72 has the fourth input node (Rl), the fifth input node (Ci) and the third output node (Co) but the circuit diagram 62 does not. In this embodiment, the signal 3\u2032-Mo is employed as both the reload signal and the result signal. When the edge (e.g., the raising edge in this embodiment) of the reload signal triggers the fourth input node (Rl), the divisor signal Di<6> on the third input node (Di) and the last divisor signal Di<7> on the fifth input node (Ci) are loaded into the cell 70. If the loaded last divisor signal Di<7> is at logic 0 level, a flip-flop 732 outputs a logic 0 signal. The logic 0 signal is then transferred into a logic 1 signal by a NOT gate 742 to reset flip-flops 734 and 736. Thus, when the last divisor signal Di<7> is at logic 0 level, the cell 70 is bypassed. At that moment, the cell 70 does not perform any dividing operation and can be regarded as being in the reset state.",

In other words, when the divisor signals Di<6> and Di<7> loaded to the cell 70 are both at logic 0 level, the cell 70 is bypassed and outputs a logic 0 signal to the fifth input node (Ci) of the fifth stage cell 80.",

Accordingly, the complexity and implementation cost are further reduced.",

        "Step 902: Providing a plurality of divisor signals.",
        "Step 904: Selectively switching each of the plurality of cells to a divide-by-two or a divide-by-three mode according to the plurality of divisor signals.",

        "The embodiments shown in FIG. 12 and FIG. 17 are used as examples in the following illustration. In Step 902, a divisor is represented in a binary form. Each bit of the binary divisor is represented as a divisor signal and ready on the third input node (Di) of a corresponding cell. Each cell is then reloaded with the corresponding divisor signal. In the programmable frequency divider 600 of FIG. 17, each cell 60 is loaded with the corresponding divisor signal (such as Di<1>, Di<2>, or Di<3>) when triggered by the rising edge of the working clock, i.e. the signal received on the first input node (Fi). Additionally, each of the cells 80 and cell 70 is loaded with the corresponding divisor signal (Di<4>, Di<5>, Di<6> or Di<7>) when the fourth input node (Rl) triggered by the raising edge of the reload signal. However, in the programmable frequency divider 500 of FIG. 12, each cell is synchronously loaded with a corresponding divisor signal when the fourth input node (Rl) triggered by the rising edge of the reload signal.",
        "In Step 904, each cell switches to a divide-by-two or a divide-by-three mode according to the loaded divisor signal. In the two embodiments of FIG. 12 and FIG. 17, the plurality of divisor signals further determines whether each of the cells having the bypass mode, such as the cell 40, 50, 70, or 80 is bypassed or not. Regarding a cell with the bypass mode, if the divisor signals input to the cell and each of its subsequent cells having the bypass mode are logic 0, the cell is bypassed and does not perform any dividing operation. In addition, the last divisor signal determines whether the last stage, such as the cell 40 or the cell 70, is bypassed or not.",
        "In the programmable frequency divider 600, the fifth stage cell 80 and the cell 70 are assumed bypassed after all the cells are loaded with a corresponding divisor signal. The bypassed cells 80 and 70 are then synchronously reset in Step 906. At that moment, the bypassed cells stop performing the dividing operation. In the programmable frequency divider 500, after all the cells are loaded with a corresponding divisor signal, the fifth stage cell 50 and the cell 40 are assumed bypassed. In Step 906, similarly, the bypassed cells are then synchronously reset. After reset, each of the bypassed cells renews its dividing operation according to the loaded divisor signal.",
        "As mentioned above, after the divisor is changed, each of the bypassed cells of the programmable frequency divider of the present invention stops its dividing operation and each of the cells which is not bypassed renews its dividing operation based on a loaded divisor signal after reset. Accordingly, after the divisor is changed, the frequency of the result signal Fout output from the programmable frequency divider is thereby guaranteed to be the result of the frequency of the source signal Fin divided with the divisor.",
        "In other words, the method for changing divisors of the present invention has the following features: First, the programmable frequency divider of the present invention only needs to utilize simple flip-flops and logic gates to extend the division range instead of employing additional programmable prescaler. Second, in order to guarantee the correctness of the frequency of the output signal, the programmable frequency divider of the present invention resets the dividing cells when changing the divisor value, so that each cell renews operation according to the divisor signal loaded when reset. Third, the programmable frequency divider of the present invention is capable of generating the result signal with continuous pulses by both synchronously resetting each cell and synchronously reloading each cell with a corresponding divisor signal. Fourth, each of the dividing cells of the programmable frequency divider is modularized, so that the cost and complexity of the circuit implementation is thereby effectively reduced.",
