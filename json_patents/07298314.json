    "abstract": "A system and method for electromagnetic position determination utilizing a calibration process. For calibration, a transmitter is positioned at multiple locations in an area of interest and multiple receivers receive and record signal characteristics from the transmitter to generate a calibration data set. The unknown position of a transmitter may be determined by receiving signals from the transmitter by multiple receivers. A locator data set is generated based on the comparison between two received signal characteristics determined for each receiver. The locator data set is compared with the calibration data set to determine the unknown position. In one embodiment, the signal comparisons are the differences between electric and magnetic field phase. Further embodiments utilize signal amplitude differences. A reciprocal method utilizing a single receiver and multiple transmitter locations is disclosed. A further method is disclosed for determining position by utilizing signals available from existing installed wiring such as power wiring.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates generally to the measurement of position or location by means of electromagnetic signaling and more particularly to position measurement utilizing near field signals in conjunction with a calibration process.",
        "2. Related Art",
        "Radio frequency (RF) techniques have been proposed to solve many ranging and position measuring problems in industry. For example, significant cost reduction is possible if inventories could be automatically tracked in a warehouse. Hospitals need to know the location of resources such as wheel chairs, gurneys, and diagnostic equipment for speedy retrieval when needed and for cost efficient operations. Hotels and resorts need to know the location of resources such as projectors, lawn mowers, golf carts, etc. Position information could inform a security system keeping track of inventories in a retail establishment and guarding against theft. Position information is critical to the national 911 system to enable first responders to know instantly the location of a call to 911 from a person in distress.",
        "Accurate, affordable position information however has been elusive. A principal source of difficulty arises from the fact that typical environments are not ideal. Outdoors, typical environments contain objects such as trees, hills, buildings, cars and such that disrupt ideal planar uniform behavior. Similarly inside, objects such as walls, studs, pipes, desks, filing cabinets, and lights tend to attenuate or block signals as well as generate multi-path reflections. In both cases, real world environments have complicated behaviors that defy exact reliable predictions.",
        "A variety of prior art seeks to overcome complicated propagation environments by mapping a signal characteristic corresponding to particular locations of interest. These techniques are sometimes collectively referred to as \u201cRF fingerprinting.\u201d The motivation behind these techniques is the hope that a sufficiently accurate map can be made to uniquely identify a particular transmit position in the same way a human fingerprint serves to uniquely identify a particular person.",
        "One RF fingerprinting approach is to deploy a network of sensors throughout an area in which one desires to track personnel or assets. Received signal strengths at each sensor may be compared to calibration, reference or experimental data to determine which previously measured location yields the best fit to a currently received signal. Christ (U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,913) uses this technique to localize personnel and Gray et al (U.S. Pat. No. 6,674,403) use this technique to track wireless devices. However, positioning based on relative signal strength is notoriously inaccurate. Network signal strength measurements may serve to localize a transmitter to a particular zone, but usually require at least one sensor per zone. This often makes it uneconomical to achieve high precision positioning. Also, the propagation environment may change significantly based on the presence of people, goods, or other transient objects that may not have been present or may have been in different positions at the time a calibration was performed.",
        "An alternate RF fingerprinting technique attempts to use multi-path signals arriving at an antenna array to localize a transmitter. Multipath signals arriving at the antenna array are compared to a database of calibrated multipath signal signatures and corresponding locations. The location whose calibrated signal signature best matches the measured signature is selected as the most likely transmitter location. Hilsenrath (U.S. Pat. No. 6,026,304) suggested this technique in conjunction with a system to localize cellular phone transmissions. More sophisticated techniques for signature matching were taught by Wax et al (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,064,339; 6,104,344; 6,108,557; 6,112,095). These techniques may be used to make more economical assignments of cellular subscribers to base stations as taught by Grubeck et al (U.S. Pat. No. 6,154,657), or applied to CDMA systems as taught by Wax et al (U.S. Pat. No. 6,249,680). Furthermore, Wang et al (U.S. Pat. No. 6,282,426) teach using time of arrival signals and simulated ray tracing. All of these techniques rely on the hope that the multi-path environment will be sufficiently stable and static to be repeatable.",
        "Chen et al (U.S. Pat. No. 6,496,701) teach a system in which the geographical location of a mobile terminal is identified by comparing characteristics such as pilot strength and chip offset from the mobile terminal with the same attributes for a variety of sub-cells and determining which sub-cell most closely matches the observed set of RF characteristics. Werb et al (U.S. Pat. No. 6,456,239) teach user selectable configuration packages in conjunction with a system for determining location of a tag using stored data. Moriya et al (U.S. Pat. No. 6,691,074) teach using accelerometers and Kalman filtering to supplement electromagnetic position measurements.",
        "Finally, there is a body of prior art involving signals conveyed on a transmission line such as a telegraphy line or a power line. Edison (U.S. Pat. No. 162,633) taught an apparatus for duplex telegraphy in which direction of current yields one signal channel and increase or decrease of current yields another.",
        "Thus, there is a need for a low cost method for range determination that may be used in complex RF propagation environments such as in and around buildings or over rough terrain and yet provide accurate, reliable results.",
        "Briefly, the present invention is a system and method for determining position by utilizing electromagnetic signaling in conjunction with a calibration process.",
        "For calibration, a mobile transmitter generates one or more beacon signals at a plurality of transmitter locations, the beacon signal for each respective transmitter location is received at a plurality of receiver locations, and a comparison unit determines and records a comparison between two or more signal characteristics for each receiver location, for each respective transmitter location. A database including calibration data set is generated comprising the receiver signal characteristics.",
        "For position determination, a transmitter located at the position to be determined transmits one or more beacon signals. A plurality of receivers receive one or more beacon signals. A comparison between at least two signal characteristics is determined for each receiver location. A locator data set is generated comprising the receiver signal characteristics. A control processor compares the locator data set with the calibration data set to determine position.",
        "In one embodiment, the comparison between two or more signal characteristics is the difference between E field phase and H field phase. In an alternate embodiment, the comparison is the difference between E field magnitude and H field magnitude. It is a feature of the invention that the E field and H field signal characteristic differences are particularly useful in the near field.",
        "Comparing data sets may include matching using a vector difference magnitude criteria. Interpolation or extrapolation may be employed to refine the match. One embodiment employs a Laplace algorithm for extrapolation to unmeasured data points.",
        "In another embodiment, calibration is achieved wherein one or more receivers receive multiple beacon signals at multiple receiver locations from a plurality of transmitters. A calibration data set is generated comprising receiver measurements.",
        "In yet another embodiment, position is determined wherein a receiver at a position to be determined receives multiple beacon signals from one or more transmitters at one or more respective transmitter locations. A locator data set is generated comprising the receiver signal characteristics. The locator data set is compared with the calibration data set to determine the position of the receiver.",
        "A further method is disclosed for determining position by utilizing signals available from existing installed wiring such as power wiring.",
        "Embodiments are also disclosed for a personal locator wherein an antenna is embedded in a lanyard such as are often used for holding identification badges or cards. This personal locator architecture is well suited for a low frequency personal location system.",
        "Further features and benefits of the present invention will be apparent from the following specification and claims when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings illustrating the preferred embodiments of the invention.

        "FIG. 1 is a graphic representation of electric and magnetic field phase relationships as a function of range for an ideal electrically small loop in free space. In FIG. 1, a graphic plot 100 includes a magnetic or H-Field phase curve 102, an electric or E-Field phase curve 104 and a phase difference or \u0394\u03c6 curve 106 representing the difference between curves 102, 104. Curves 102, 104, 106 are plotted against a first axis 108 representing phase (preferably in degrees) as a function of range represented on a second axis 110 in wavelength (preferably in a kilogram-meter-second unit, such as meters) of an electromagnetic signal under consideration. Thus, the relations of Equations [6]-[8] are illustrated in graphical representation 100. H-field phase curve 102, described by Equation [7], begins 90\u00b0 out of phase with respect to E-field phase 104, described by Equation [6]. As range is increased from about 0.05\u03bb to about 0.50\u03bb, H-field phase curve 102 initially decreases, then increases. Similarly, as range is increased from about 0.05\u03bb to about 0.50\u03bb, E-field phase curve 104 increases, gradually at first, and at an increasing rate as range increases. The difference between E-field phase curve 104 and H-field phase curve 102 is represented by \u0394\u03c6 curve 106. \u0394\u03c6 curve 106 begins at approximately 90\u00b0 (i.e., at phase quadrature) in the near-field within a range of about 0.05\u03bb and goes to 0\u00b0 (i.e., phase synchronicity) as the far-field is approached, past a range of about 0.50\u03bb. \u0394\u03c6 curve 106 is described mathematically in Equation [8]. Transition of \u0394\u03c6 curve 106 from phase quadrature to phase synchronicity between about 0.05\u03bb to about 0.50\u03bb is substantially continuous and predictable and is used to advantage by the present invention. With more precise measurement, this phase transition can be beneficially used at ranges inside 0.05\u03bb and outside 0.50\u03bb.",
        "Equation [8] expresses phase difference \u0394\u03c6 as a function of range (r). Equation [8] is a transcendental relation that may not be inverted to yield an expression for range as a function of phase difference. Nevertheless, a variety of mathematical methods may be used to determine a range given a phase difference. Equation [8] may be advantageously employed by other mathematical techniques such as, by way of example and not by way of limitation, solving numerically, generating a look-up table, and solving graphically.",
        "In the far-field, at distances greater than one wavelength, both the electric and magnetic fields are phase synchronous. The phase of each field varies in lock step with the other field at a fixed rate of 360\u00b0 per wavelength in the far-field limit. This is the usual relationship expected by those skilled in the RF arts. As a rule, the near-field phase anomalies exploited by the preferred embodiment of present invention are rarely discussed, if at all, in the prior art. One exception to this rule is the work of one of the inventors. [Electromagnetic Energy Around Hertzian Dipoles, by H. Schantz; IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, April 2001; pp. 50-62.]",
        "FIG. 2 is a table relating range of operation and frequency for a near-field ranging system. In FIG. 2, a table 200 relates frequency with selected ranges expressed in terms of wavelength of a signal under consideration. An important feature of the present invention is that a phase difference \u0394\u03c6 between electric and magnetic fields may be exploited to determine a range from a locator receiver to a beacon transmitter, or other source of electromagnetic waves. This near-field ranging method allows a distance to a beacon to be accurately determined between about 0.05\u03bb and 0.50\u03bb from the beacon, where \u03bb is the wavelength of electromagnetic signal transmitted by a beacon. Optimum performance is obtained from a range of about 0.08\u03bb to a range of about 0.30\u03bb from the beacon. With more precise measurement, this phase transition can be used for ranges inside 0.05\u03bb and outside 0.50\u03bb. A corresponding characteristic range of operation as a function of frequency is presented in table 200; FIG. 2. Lower frequencies permit operation at longer ranges; higher frequencies are preferred for shorter ranges.

Accuracy within inches is achievable even at the longest ranges.",

To avoid unnecessary prolixity in the discussion that follows, sometimes only a single locator and a single beacon are discussed.

Beacon 610 includes a transmitter 612 which may be mobile or fixed, and a transmit antenna 636. Transmitter 612 may include means to change properties of a transmitted electromagnetic signal 615 including, by way of illustration and not by way of limitation, changing frequency, phase, polarization, or amplitude of an electromagnetic signal 615 according to a predetermined pattern, in response to an input or stimulus, such as, for example, a control signal received from a data bus 695. In alternate embodiments, transmitter 612 may modulate a transmitted electromagnetic signal 615 so as to convey information. Such information may include information that identifies beacon 610 or other information or telemetry of value to a user. For example, binary phase shift keying may be implemented on a transmitted electromagnetic signal 615 without impairing ranging performance of the present invention. In still another embodiment, transmitter 612 may turn on or off according to a predetermined pattern, in response to a control signal from a data bus 695, or in response to some other input or stimulus. Such input or stimulus may include (but is not necessarily limited to) a signal from an accelerometer, a timer, a motion detector, other transducers or other sensors.",

For instance, transmitter 612 might operate at approximately ten times an allowed average power level but only transmit 10% of a characteristic period, thus maintaining a substantially similar average transmit power level. Such intermittent operation would enable a higher signal to noise ratio (SNR) signal. Periodic operation of beacon 610 is also advantageous for operation in the presence of interference. When beacon 610 is silent (i.e., not transmitting), locator 620 can characterize a particular coherent noise source such as an interfering signal and can compensate for the presence of this coherent noise once beacon 610 begins transmitting again.",

Electric antenna 1232 detects a first (electric or E-field) signal proportional to the electric component of electromagnetic signal 1215 and conveys the first signal to an antenna port 1270 of a first receiver 1225 included in locator 1220. Locator 1220 also includes a magnetic antenna 1231 that is sensitive to the magnetic component of electromagnetic signal 1215. Magnetic antenna 1231 detects a second (magnetic or H-field) signal proportional to the magnetic component of electromagnetic signal 1215 and conveys the second signal to a second receiver 1227 included in locater 1220. Second receiver 1227 is constructed in substantial similarity to receiver 1225; details of construction of receiver 1227 are omitted in FIG. 12 in order to simplify the description of ranging system 1200.",
        "Exact spacing between electric antenna 1232 and magnetic antenna 1231 is not critical, providing that spacing is large enough to avoid undesired mutual coupling and spacing is small relative to the wavelength \u03bb of electromagnetic signal 1215. The inventors have arranged electric antenna 1232 and magnetic antenna 1231 separated by a distance on the order of 1%-3% of a wavelength (0.03\u03bb-0.01\u03bb). In alternate embodiments, electric antenna 1232 and magnetic antenna 1231 may be arranged in a single integral unit with a first terminal yielding an E-field response and a second terminal yielding an H-field response. Although spacing between antennas is preferentially small relative to the wavelength \u03bb of electromagnetic signal 1215, a larger spacing between electric antenna 1232 and magnetic antenna 1231 may be tolerated if phase detector 1280 or range detector 1290 in locator 1220 are compensated for the effect of the larger spacing.",
        "Locator 1220 also includes a pre-select filter 1242 that receives the first (electric) signal from antenna port 1270. Pre-select filter 1242 passes the first (electric) signal in a desired band, but rejects signals with undesirable frequencies. Typically pre-select filter 1242 will pass a band of frequencies within which beacon 1210 might transmit an electromagnetic signal 1215 for a relevant application. Selection of a band will depend upon a variety of factors including, but not necessarily limited to, regulatory constraints, propagation behavior of an electromagnetic signal 1215, and a desired range r of operation. The present invention offers optimal performance for a desired range r of operation approximately constrained by 0.08\u03bb to 0.30\u03bb, where \u03bb is the wavelength of the electromagnetic signal 1215 transmitted by beacon 1210. A typical operating range is generally within 0.05\u03bb to 0.50\u03bb. Higher performance implementations of the present invention may operate at ranges r less than 0.05\u03bb and greater than 0.50\u03bb.",
        "A front-end-amplifier 1265 increases the amplitude of the first (electric) signal. If atmospheric and other noise are sufficiently low, it is advantageous for an amplifier to have a noise figure sufficiently low to avoid introducing undesired noise, a dynamic range large enough to accommodate the potential variation in amplitude of the first (electric) signal, and a gain sufficient to yield a suitably large amplitude first (electric) signal so that a weak signal will properly drive phase detector 1281. The inventors have advantageously used a Mini-Circuits ZFL-500 amplifier as a front-end-amplifier 1265, but a wide variety of other amplifiers are suitable.",
        "A mixer 1252 mixes the first (electric) signal with a local oscillator (LO) signal generated by a local oscillator 1250 thus yielding a first intermediate frequency (IF) signal. Local oscillator 1250 may be a traditional sine wave oscillator. Local oscillator 1250 may also be a direct digital synthesizer (DDS), or other waveform template generator. For instance, the inventors have used an Analog Devices DDS (AD 9835) as local oscillator 1250 and a Mini-Circuits SBL-3 mixer as mixer 1252. A wide variety of alternate implementations are possible.",
        "An IF amplifier 1262 increases the amplitude of the first IF signal. The inventors have found that a pair of current feedback operational amplifiers providing about +50 dB of gain were a suitable embodiment of IF amplifier 1262, but a wide variety of alternatives are available to practitioners of the RF arts.",
        "An IF filter 1244 accepts only the desired first IF signal and rejects other undesired signals. A crystal filter may be advantageously used as IF filter 1244. Such a crystal filter is characterized by an extremely narrow pass band, and preferably has a constant group delay within the pass band. A narrow pass band acts so as to allow the desired first IF signal to be conveyed to phase detector 1281 while rejecting adjacent undesired signals and noise.",
        "Local oscillator 1250 may also be advantageously used as a tuner to select among a plurality of electromagnetic signals transmitted by a plurality of beacons 1210. A particular beacon 1210 emitting a particular electromagnetic signal may be distinguished from other beacons emitting other electromagnetic signals, where other signals have slightly different frequencies. Thus a single locator 1220 may track a large number of different beacons 1210. A variety of other schemes for tracking multiple beacons are possible, including for example, time division multiple access, code division multiple access, frequency hopping, or other schemes for achieving a desired channelization. Similarly, a large number of different locators 1220 may measure ranges to a particular beacon 1210. Local oscillator 1250 may be considered as a component of an individual receiver 1225 or 1227 or as a common frequency standard for a plurality of receivers 1225, 1227.",
        "Phase detector 1281 accepts the first IF signal from first receiver 1225 and a second IF signal from second receiver 1227 and generates an output voltage proportional to a phase difference between the first IF signal and the second IF signal. For purposes of illustration and not limitation, one exemplary embodiment of phase detector 1280 is an Analog Devices AD 8302. This particular phase detector also yields an output proportional to a magnitude difference that may help identify and correct for propagation anomalies and provide a more accurate determination of range in some circumstances. Range detector 1290 is included in locator 1220 and accepts an input from a phase detector 1281 for determining range r between beacon 1210 and locator 1220. The inventors used a Measurement Computing Corporation PC-Card-DAS 16/16 A/D PCMCIA Card and a notebook computer to embody range detector 1290, but there are a great many ways one skilled in the RF arts could implement range detector 1290.",
        "The present invention offers good performance for a desired range of operation approximately within ranges r between 0.05\u03bb and 0.50\u03bb away, and more optimal performance was achieved within a range r between 0.08\u03bb and 0.30\u03bb where \u03bb is the wavelength of electromagnetic signal 1215 transmitted by beacon 1210.

        "To aid understanding the present invention, this disclosure has focused on a narrowband continuous wave (CW) implementation of the present invention. It should be understood that the present invention may also be implemented using multiple frequencies, time domain impulse waveforms, stepped or swept sets of appropriate frequencies, or other signals more complicated than an individual narrowband CW signal. For example, a phase difference of a CW signal may be related to a time delay, or more generally, a Hilbert transform of an arbitrary time domain signal. Any waveform (whether a CW waveform, short pulse, impulse, or time domain waveform, chirped waveform, or other waveform) will evolve from a near-field shape to a far-field shape in a manner that facilitates distance measurement and positioning according to the teachings of the present invention.",
        "Near Field Ranging with Calibration",
        "Near Field Propagation",
        "Near field electromagnetic ranging uses comparisons between two or more near field signal characteristics that vary in a predictable way with respect to distance or position. As explained in applicant's earlier co-pending work on near field electromagnetic ranging, one particularly useful comparison is between electric and magnetic field phase. This phase delta between electric and magnetic phase varies in a non-linear but predictable fashion within the near field. About a small electric antenna (small relative to \u00bc wavelength), for instance, the phase delta varies with range, but does not vary with respect to angle, such as azimuth angle. FIG. 19 is a schematic diagram illustrating the uniform variation of near field comparisons in an open field environment. In a typical open near field propagation environment 1900, the magnitudes of near field comparisons form uniform circular contours 1902-1908 around a transmitter 1910 (Antennas are shown co-located with the transmitters and receivers), i.e. the near field comparison magnitude shown in FIG. 19 varies with range from the transmitter, but is the same value for any angle, such as azimuth angle, about the center transmitter. Receivers within a near field range of transmitter 1910 such as receivers 1912-1916 detect near field signals, effect a comparison between two or more near field signal properties, and locate transmitter 1910. Such near field properties may include but are not limited to electric field intensity, and magnetic field intensity. Comparisons may include but are not limited to relative phase angles and amplitudes.",
        "FIG. 20 is a schematic diagram depicting the distortions of near field comparisons in a cluttered and complicated propagation environment. In a typical cluttered near field propagation environment 2000, the magnitudes of near field comparisons no longer form uniform circular contours 1902-1908 around a transmitter 1910. Consider a typical propagation environment such as office environment 2010. Office environment 2010 comprises offices 2012-2018 and a hallway 2020. In the presence of office environment 2010, the magnitudes of near field comparisons form distorted contours 2002-2008. Although distorted contours 2002-2008 vary slowly enough to enable ready correlation between a magnitude of a near field comparison and a position, distorted contours 2002-2008 no longer vary uniformly with respect to angle. Thus, if a near field electromagnetic ranging system were to operate in a typical cluttered near field propagation environment 2000, a system and method for calibration of a near field electromagnetic ranging system offers the potential for improved accuracy.",
        "FIG. 20 depicts office environment 2010 as an example of a typical cluttered propagation environment. Similar behavior occurs in home and residential environments, business, retail, and industrial environments, and in the complicated propagation environment between and around stacked shipping containers just to name a few. Office environment 2010 is an illustrative example. Nothing herein should be interpreted so as to limit application of the present invention to any particular environment.",

At each point, receivers 1912-1916 (also referred to as RX1-RX3) detect the near field beacon signals, effect a comparison between two or more near field signal properties, collect reference data regarding a magnitude of a near field comparison, and convey data to a control processor such as central controller 2102. One skilled in the data processing and computational arts will realize that a wide variety of data structures and processing methods are possible within the bounds of the present invention. One embodiment preferred in many applications is for a central controller 2102 to store a calibration set of measurements, which may also be called reference data, in a matrix 2104. The matrix 2104 stores reference data corresponding to measurements made by each receiver (RXj) as the reference transmitter 1910 is moved to each point P1-P5 (Pi). The matrix of reference data may also be referred to as a database. The database may be recorded on media or transmitted by network to make the data available at a later time or to additional users.",
