        "Latin name of the genus and species of the plant claimed: Lobelia erinus.",
        "Varietal denomination: \u2018Lobmounwi\u2019.",
        "The present invention comprises a new and distinct Lobelia plant botanically known as Lobelia erinus and referred to by the cultivar name \u2018Lobmounwi\u2019.",
        "The new cultivar is propagated by cuttings resulting from the cross between \u2018R616\u2019 and \u2018A950.\u2019 \u2018R616\u2019 is a white flower color selection of our own breeding, having a mounding to semitrailing habit, very strong growth, good branching plant habit and being early flowering. \u2018A950\u2019 is a white flower color selection of our own breeding, having a strong growth, semitrailing plant habit and not very branching. Neither \u2018R616\u2019 or \u2018A950\u2019 has been patented.",
        "As a result of this cross the present cultivar was created from a single plant in 2001 in Enkhuizen, Netherlands and has been repeatedly asexually reproduced by cuttings in Enkhuizen, Netherlands over a five year period. It has been found to retain its distinctive characteristics through successive propagations and this novelty appears to be firmly fixed.",
        "This new Lobelia plant is illustrated by the accompanying photographic drawing which shows blooms, buds and foliage of the plant in full color, the color showing being as true as can be reasonably obtained by conventional photographic procedures.",
        "The following detailed descriptions set forth the distinctive characteristics of this new Lobelia. The data which defines these characteristics were collected from asexual reproductions carried out in Enkhuizen, Netherlands. The plant history was taken on 20 week old plants.",
        "Colors readings were taken in the laboratory under ambient light. Color references are primarily to The R.H.S. Colour Chart of The Royal Horticultural Society of London.",
