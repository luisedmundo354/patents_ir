    "abstract": "A wireless communication system of a simple configuration enabled to perform both data communication and accurate ranging. In the system, a second wireless unit receives a ranging signal after a lapse of a propagation time since a first wireless unit transmits the ranging signal. Then, after a delay of an image elimination period, the second wireless unit transmits a response signal. The first wireless unit receives the response signal after a lapse of a propagation time. Then, the first wireless unit obtains the propagation time, during which the signal propagates between the first and second wireless unit, according to an elapsed time since the ranging signal is transmitted. The distance therebetween is obtained by dividing the obtained propagation time by the velocity of light. Before the image elimination period elapses, in order to eliminate the physical reflection of radio waves, the first wireless unit is inhibited from opening a reception gate.",

        "The present document is based on Japanese Priority Document JP 2002-191637, filed in the Japanese Patent Office on Jul. 1, 2002, the entire contents of which being incorporated herein by reference.",
        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a wireless communication system, a wireless communication device, a wireless communication method, and a computer program, which are used for enabling intercommunication among a plurality of wireless stations.",
        "More particularly, the present invention relates to a wireless communication system, a wireless communication device, a wireless communication method, and a computer program, which are used for measuring or specifying a geographical position of a wireless terminal in a wireless network. More specifically, the present invention relates to a wireless communication system, a wireless communication device, a wireless communication method, and a computer program, which are used for measuring or specifying a geographical position of a wireless terminal in a wireless network with a granularity that is finer than a cell size.",
        "2. Description of Related Art",
        "Configuring a LAN (Local Area Network) by connecting a plurality of computers enables sharing of information, such as files and data, and peripheral equipment, such as a printer, and also enables information exchange, such as transfer of e-mails or data contents.",
        "Hitherto, a wired LAN connection using optical-fiber cables, coaxial cables, or twisted-pair cables has commonly been employed. In this case, line-laying is needed, so that it is difficult to easily build a network, and that cable drawing is troublesome. The wired-LAN connection is inconvenient because the moving range of equipment is limited by cable length even after the LAN is built. Accordingly, a wireless LAN attracts attention as a system for freeing users from the wiring of a related art wired LAN. This wireless LAN saves most of wiring cables in a working space of an office. Consequently, communication terminals, such as personal computers (PCs), can relatively easily be moved therein.",
        "In recent years, with increase in operating speed and reduction in cost of a wireless LAN system, demands therefor have extremely increased. Recently, the introduction of a personal area network (PAN) is studied so as to build a small wireless network built among a plurality of electronics provided in a person's immediate environment.",
        "Different wireless communication systems have been prescribed by utilizing frequency bands, such as the 2.4-GHz band or the 5-GHz band, the frequencies of which are available without permissions from competent authorities. An IEEE 802.11 wireless network system utilizes radio waves at frequencies of the 2.4-GHz band or the 5-GHz band and enables spatial information transmission at a speed ranging from several Mbps to several tens Mbps. In many wireless networks, wireless transmitting/receiving devices, which are enabled to perform effective communication within a \u201ccell\u201d coverage under a control of a wireless base station, operate and perform intercommunication among them. Generally, each cell has a diameter ranging from several tens meters to several hundreds meters.",
        "Usually, one service area is provided with a plurality of wireless base stations. A wired network intercommunicates among these base stations. Each of the wireless base stations notifies wireless terminals, which are present in a cell, of the presence of a cell coverage area thereof by periodically broadcasting a radio frame, which is called a beacon frame (incidentally, a beacon frame is represented by an identification signal), to the wireless terminals. Thus, a wireless network is built. Additionally, this beacon frame may include information for performing a communication control operation, such as an operation of assigning a time slot to a specific terminal.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates a multiple access method using CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance) technique, which is employed in an IEEE 802.11 system.",
        "This figure illustrates a case that a base station communicates with two terminals A and B. An example illustrated in this figure is adapted so that the base station performs unicast communication with each of the terminals, and that when a data frame is accurately received by a receiving portion, the receiving portion informs a transmitting portion of success of the communication by returning an ACK frame thereto.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates a format of a data frame according to the IEEE 802.11 standard. FIG. 3 shows a format of the ACK frame. In the format of each of these frames, a MAC (Machine Access Control) header has a Duration/ID field for which a value updating a time required until the completion of a sequence of communication operations is substituted. When a terminal, which currently transmits no data, receives this field, this terminal is enabled to predict a time when this terminal becomes able to transmit data.",
        "According to a CSMA/CA method, radio waves are asynchronously transmitted from the base station and the terminals. Thus, to avoid a collision of frames and to realize priorities of transmissions of data frames according to the kinds of the data frames, a contention period, a backoff period, and periods each called an IFS (Inter-Frame Space) interval, during which the transmissions are inhibited, are set between the data frames. Incidentally, in FIG. 1, \u201cDIFS\u201d is an abbreviation of \u201cDCF IFS\u201d (additionally, \u201cDCF\u201d is an abbreviation of \u201cDistributed Coordination Function\u201d described in the IEEE 802.11 specification), and \u201cSIFS\u201d is an abbreviation of \u201cShort IFS\u201d also described therein. The values of the SIFS interval and the DIFS interval are 16 microseconds and 34 microseconds as practical values of the IFS interval according to the IEEE 802.11 standards, respectively.",
        "FIG. 4 illustrates a multiple access method using a TDMA/TDD (Time Division Multiple Access/Time Division Duplex) technique. According to this method, transmission and reception operations in the base station and all the terminals accessing thereto under the control of the base station, are performed in synchronization with one another. In an example illustrated in this figure, a frame period of a frame repeated in a predetermined cycle is divided into a plurality of slot periods that are assigned to periods during which the transmission and reception operations are performed by the base station and the terminals. Because the duration of each of the slot periods is constant, a time period unused for data communication may occur in a case that a time required to transmit data is shorter than the slot period. Additionally, transmission inhibition periods for preventing occurrences of collisions of transmission slots due to the difference in distance between the base station and each of the terminals and in transmission timing therebetween, that is, guard periods are set in the frame period.",
        "Meanwhile, in a wireless network, each of wireless terminals usually can geographically move. To enable a wireless terminal to continuously make communication even when the wireless terminal goes out of a cell covered by a certain base station, it is necessary to perform an operation of successively changing a base station, to which the wireless terminal is connected, with the movement of the wireless terminal. Generally, such an operation of changing the base station is called a \u201chandover\u201d.",
        "To perform a handover, it is necessary that a wireless terminal knows the presence of a base station by receiving a beacon frame transmitted from the base station. The wireless terminal selects a base station, which can provide better communication thereto, by utilizing the electric field strength (indicated by RSSI (Received Signal Strength Intensity) signals) of the beacon or utilizing, during the wireless terminal is connected to a base station, the RSSI of a data communication frame so as to be connected to the base station and as to make judgment on the base station. In such a system, during the terminal is connected to the base station, the position of the terminal can be known with the granularity that is equal to the size of the cell covered by the base station.",
        "The terminal connected to the base station can exchange information with various servers through a wired network connecting between the base stations. In this case, a user can enjoy services provided by the data communication.",
        "Related art wireless network techniques do not provide a mechanism for measuring the geographical position of a terminal. Because only rough conjecture thereof employing the size of the cell, which is covered by the base station, as the granularity can be performed, in a case that the coverage area thereof is large, and that a plurality of cells overlap with one another, a problem may occur. It is impossible to discriminate among a plurality of terminals connected to the same base station.",
        "In a case that a problem occurs when the position of a terminal is specified with the granularity that is equal to the size of the wireless cell, it is considered to adopt a more accurate approach of combining ultrasonic-based or infrared-based techniques of measuring the position of a wireless terminal with a device for data communication. However, it is necessary to mount two systems, that is, a data communication system and a position measuring system in a wireless communication device. This results in increase in size and cost of the apparatus.",
        "It is also considered to adopt another approach of measuring the position of a wireless terminal by causing a base station to first transmit a data frame and to measure the distance therefrom to the wireless terminal according to a time from the transmission of the data frame to reception of an ACK frame from the wireless terminal. However, it is necessary for realizing the distance measuring accuracy of, for example, 1 meter to complete the generation and transmission of an ACK frame in a time of less than 10 nanoseconds. Consequently, a complex and expensive system is needed.",
        "Recently, a cellular telephone system combined with a GPS (Global Positioning System) so as to provide means for detecting a position of a terminal has emerged. This is a technology of a US company, QUALCOMM, Incorporated that is called gpsOne (incidentally, gpsOne is a trademark of QUALCOMM, Incorporated). According to this technology, a wireless terminal having received a positioning signal from a GPS satellite performs signal processing in cooperation with the base station. Usually, each cell coverage area in a cellular telephone network has a diameter of several hundreds meters to several kilometers. According to this system, the geographical position of the terminal can be identified with the accuracy of about several meters.",
        "Although such a GPS can identify the position of a terminal with the precision of several meters, this function cannot be utilized with high precision in an environment that cannot get radio waves from the GPS satellite. Thus, a constraint is imposed to the indoor utilization of radio waves sent from a GPS satellite. A circuit for processing GPS signals is also needed. Consequently, the whole system is complicated.",

As shown in the figure, a frame in a wireless segment consists of parts respectively corresponding to a \u201cdata period\u201d and a \u201cranging period\u201d. Both these periods are merged into a period that is referred to as a \u201cpseudoframe period\u201d herein.",

A pulse width can be shorten or lengthen according to the desired accuracy of measurement of the distance, similarly as done in a field of existing radar technology. For example, currently, a pulse width of 1 nanosecond (ns) or less can be realized by utilizing UWB (Ultra Wide Band) wireless technology (incidentally, a UWB system uses extremely fine pulses thereby to have high time resolution and to enable high-accuracy ranging by utilizing high-definition radar and precision-positioning-capabilities).",

This response signal consists of a single pulse signal or a plurality of pulse signals in correspondence with the ranging signal sent from the base station.",
        "In the present specification, a time from the transmission of a ranging signal from a base station to the reception of a response signal by the base station is referred to as a \u201cpseudorange time\u201d. This \u201cpseudorange time\u201d includes an \u201cimage elimination period\u201d, which is necessary for masking an image due to the reflection of waves from an unintended object, and also includes a delay time caused in a pulse processing circuit in the terminal, in addition to a two-way propagation time of a pulse propagating between a base station and a terminal at a propagation velocity. The distance between the base station and the terminal is determined from this pseudorange time.",

For example, the system may be adapted so that when the value of the ranging delay field is 0, the ranging flag is off, and that when the value of the ranging delay field is not 0, the ranging flag is on and this is equivalent to the designation of the value of the ranging delay. In addition to the above-mentioned field, other information fields (see FIG. 2), which are present in the frame according to the IEEE 802.11 standard, may be present as fields that are precedent or subsequent to the data frame shown in the figure.",
        "FIG. 7 shows various ranges used when a base station measures the distance therefrom to each of other terminals.

A value of the two-way propagation time of the wave propagating between the base station and the reflecting object-is used as a value of this period N. This value is determined according to the transmitted power of the ranging signal and to physical conditions for reflecting the waves in the vicinity of the base station.",
        "A range, in which the base station performs measurement of the distance, is defined as a ranging gate period P. This value P is determined according to the two-way propagation time from the base station to a maximum ranging distance and the delay time occurred in a pulse processing circuit in the terminal.",
        "A one-way wave propagation time of the wave propagating from the base station to the terminal is defined as a propagation time X. A value obtained by multiplying this value X by the velocity of light is calculated as an absolute distance between the base station and the terminal.",
        "FIG. 8 illustrates an entire sequence of measuring the distance between the base station and each of the other terminals in this embodiment.",
        "The measurement of the distance between the base station and the terminal may be started by a request from a base-station selection device of the terminal or from an application program executed in the terminal in a case that the measurement of the distance therebetween is periodically performed by the base station. When the request arrives at the base station, the base station transmits a data frame, in which the ranging flag is on, to a terminal address of a terminal whose distance from the base station is to be measured. Then, the base station transmits a ranging signal when a time designated by the ranging delay field elapses from the start of the transmission of the data frame.",
        "The terminal receives the data frame from the base station. Then, the terminal makes a judgment on a destination address. Thus, the terminal decides whether or not the data frame is sent to itself. If not, a time taken until the completion of this pseudoframe can be determined by referring to the value designated by the frame period field. Conversely, if so, the terminal refers to the ranging delay field and determines a time when the ranging signal arrives on the basis of the leading portion of the data frame received.",
        "The terminal has a reception-inhibiting device in a wireless reception circuit so as to prevent the reception of signals other than a ranging signal during the ranging. This device is called a pulse reception gate. The terminal does not receive a signal in a period other than a time during this gate is enabled. Especially, in a case of utilizing UWB wireless technology, this device is important for enhancing capability to distinguish an object signal from an interference signal. A gate width W needed for receiving this ranging signal is determined by a width of a pulse signal to be transmitted. An ideal value of the gate width is equal to a width of a pulse to be transmitted. However, usually, because of the influence of the performance and margin of the reception circuit, a value, which is larger than the ideal value, is set to be the gate width W. When the terminal receives the last portion of the data frame, the gate is disabled. After a lapse of a time of (the ranging delay\u2212W/2) since the reception of the leading portion of the data frame, the terminal enables the reception gate again. Subsequently, after a lapse of a time, which is equal to the gate width W, the terminal performs an operation of disabling this gate.",
        "The terminal receives a ranging signal transmitted from the base station after the lapse of the propagation time X. Then, the terminal transmits a response signal after delayed by a time, whose length is equal that of the image elimination period N, since the reception of this ranging signal. An actual delay time is obtained by adding a time D, which is needed for the passage of the signal through the circuit, to the period N. This time D is allowed to always have a length of 0, or have a constant length during the ranging. However, the time D is permitted to vary within the ranging accuracy.",
        "The base station receives a response signal transmitted by the terminal after the lapse of the propagation time X. Incidentally, although the base station has a reception gate device, a time period during which the gate is enabled, and a method of determining the width of this time period respectively differ from the corresponding time period and method employed in the terminal.",
        "The base station does not enable the reception gate until the two-way wave propagation time elapses in the range in which a reflection wave can reach there, that is, until the image elimination period N elapses. Consequently, the base station can prevent the reception of the ranging signal, which is transmitted therefrom itself, as a physically reflected wave signal. The reception gate is enabled until the two-way delay time in the range, in which ranging is performed, as shown in FIG. 7 elapses.",
        "When the response signal is received during the reception gate is enabled, the base station determines a time, which is elapsed since the transmission of the ranging signal therefrom, as a signal roundtrip time T by the following expression (1):\n\nT=N+2X+D \u2003\u2003(1)\n\nThus, the distance from the base station to the terminal is obtained by the following expression (2):\n\n(T\u2212N\u2212D)/2\u00d7C \u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere C designates the velocity of light.",
        "Practically, a processing delay D of the terminal is included in the signal roundtrip time. Thus, when the value of the processing delay D cannot be determined, the distance is determined to be longer by D\u00d7C. When the absolute value of the delay D is determined, an absolute distance between the base station and the terminal is determined. In the case that the value of the delay D is not determined, the distance therebetween is determined as a pseudorange.",
        "A plurality of pseudoranges each between the terminal and a corresponding one of a plurality of base stations can be obtained by iteratively performing the measurement of the distance between the terminal and a corresponding one of a plurality of base stations. In this case, when the value of the processing delay D included in the pseudorange is constant during the ranging period, or varies within a range in which the requested accuracy is not affected, the order of the relative distances each between the terminal and a corresponding one of the base stations can be determined. According to a result of this, the terminal or the base station can perform an operation of updating the interconnection relation therebetween and also can switch processing to be performed by executing an application program. FIG. 9 illustrates an example of this manner. In a case of the example illustrated in this figure, when a second pseudorange is shorter than a first pseudorange, the terminal is connected to a second base station.",
        "In a case of another example of application of the present invention, in a case that the two-dimensional coordinates of each of the base stations are known, the two-dimensional position of the terminal can be determined by measuring the pseudoranges of the terminal to three or more of the base stations. In FIG. 10, let (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) denote the coordinates of three base stations, that is, a first base station to a third base station, respectively. Further, let r1, r2, and r3 designate the pseudoranges of the terminal to the first base station to the third base station, respectively. Then, the following simultaneous equations (3) are solved for x and y.\n\n(x\u2212x1)2+(y\u2212y1)2=(r1\u2212D\u00d7C)2\n\n(x\u2212x2)2+(y\u2212y2)2=(r2\u2212D\u00d7C)2\n\n(x\u2212x3)2+(y\u2212y3)2=(r3\u2212D\u00d7C)2\u2003\u2003(3)",

The impulse is radiated to a space through the antenna 114. Simultaneously, a signal is sent to a phase difference measurement portion 107.",

Simultaneously, the reception gate switch portion 213 controls a switch portion 215 so that a signal sent from the pulse reception portion 216 is directed to a signal delay portion 214. Incidentally, the reception gate width W is determined by the pulse width of a transmitted pulse, an error time between the value of the start delay caused in the base station and a value of a time taken until the actual transmission of the pulse, or an error time caused at the detection of the termination of the data frame in the terminal 200.",

        "(4) When receiving the signal, the signal delay portion 214 delays the signal by a time that is equal to the period N in which the reflection wave can reach the base station. Thereafter, the signal delay portion 214 sends the delayed signal to a pulse transmission portion 203.",
        "The pulse transmission portion 203 generates an impulse in response to the signal sent from the signal delay portion 214. Then, the pulse transmission portion 203 radiates the generated impulse to the space as a response signal through the antenna.",
        "An operation time of the reception gate provided at the side of the wireless terminal 200 is designated by the field in the data frame (see FIG. 6). Thus, the pulse arrival timing can be predicted with high accuracy. A high processing gain can be realized. The precision of discrimination between a ranging signal and a noise can be enhanced.",
        "However, the operation time of the reception gate at the wireless base station 100 should have a period corresponding to the range in which ranging is performed by the terminal 200. This period is longer as compared with the duration width of the response signal sent from the terminal 200. Therefore, it is necessary to devise some means for obtaining a high processing gain.",
        "Thus, according to a wireless base station 100-2 and a wireless terminal 200-2 according to a second embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in FIGS. 13 and 14, the terminal 200-2 returns a sequence of PN(Pseudonoise)-coded pulses to the base station 100-2 in response to the impulse sent therefrom. The base station 100-2 uses a sequence of the same PN-coded pulses as used by the terminal 200-2 in synchronization with the transmission time of the ranging signal, and conducts measurement by performing correlation processing on these PN-coded pulses and those sent from the terminal 200-2.",
        "As shown in FIG. 14, in the terminal 200-2, a PN code generation portion 219 is added thereto as a subsequent stage of the signal delay portion 214. Low autocorrelation codes, such as an M-code, are utilized as the PN code.",
        "The PN code generation portion 219 generates PN codes of one cycle simultaneously with the arrival of the signal from the signal delay portion 214 and then sends the generated PN codes to the code modulation portion 202. Incidentally, the PN code generation portion 219 may generate PN codes of several cycles for the correlation processing performed at the reception side. In this case, a period value is modulated using the PN code. Then, the delay time is determined by picking out the period value at which coincidence occurs during the correlation processing performed in the reception side.",
        "As shown in FIG. 13, the base station 100-2 is equipped with the same PN code generation portion as provided in the terminal 200-2.",
        "The ranging signal generation portion 104 notifies the PN code generation portion 115 of the generation of the ranging signal to be sent to the terminal 200-2. Then, the ranging signal generation portion 104 starts the generation of the PN code.",
        "A correlation processing portion 116 detects a correlation value corresponding to the correlation between the signal sent form the PN code generation portion 115 and the signal sent from the code demodulation portion 109. Then, the signal roundtrip time T can be determined from a maximum correlation position.",
        "Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail above, it should be understood that other modifications and alternatives will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the sprint of the present invention, that the foregoing description of the embodiments of the present invention is illustrative, and that the present invention is not limited thereto. The scope of the invention, therefore, should be determined solely by the appended claims."
