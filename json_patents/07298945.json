    "abstract": "A polarization splitting grating coupler (PSGC) connects an optical signal from an optical element, such as a fiber, to an optoelectronic integrated circuit. The PSGC separates a received optical signal into two orthogonal polarizations and directs the two polarizations to separate waveguides on an integrated circuit. Each of the two separated polarizations can then be processed, as needed for a particular application, by the integrated circuit. A PSGC can also operate in the reverse direction, and couple two optical signals from an integrated circuit to two respective orthogonal polarizations of one optical output signal sent off chip to an optical fiber.",

        "The present invention relates to an apparatus for facilitating the connection of optical signals from optical fibers to optoelectronic integrated circuits.",
        "Optical fibers have been widely used for the propagation of optical signals, especially to provide high speed communications links. Optical links using fiber optics have many advantages compared to electrical links: large bandwidth, high noise immunity, reduced power dissipation and minimal crosstalk. Optical signals carried by optical fibers are processed by a wide variety of optical and optoelectronic devices, including integrated circuits. Optical communications signals in optical fibers are typically in the 1.3 \u03bcm and 1.55 \u03bcm infrared wavelength bands. Optoelectronic integrated circuits made of silicon are highly desirable since they can be fabricated at low cost in the same foundries used to make VLSI integrated circuits. The optical properties of silicon are well suited for the transmission of optical signals, due to its transparency in the infrared wavelength bands of 1.3 \u03bcm and 1.55 \u03bcm and its high refractive index. As a result, low loss planar silicon optical waveguides have been successfully built in silicon integrated circuits.",
        "Optical signals traveling in optical fiber frequently need to be coupled to optoelectronic circuits and this can be done through a variety of known techniques and devices. Once an optical signal is on a chip, it can be processed either as an optical signal or converted to an electronic signal for further processing.",
        "The flat end of an optical fiber can be directly connected to the edge of an integrated circuit, so an optical signal can be coupled to a flat end of an integrated waveguide, but the fiber and the waveguide have different cross sectional geometries and are very different in size.",
        "An optical signal in a fiber can be coupled to a waveguide through the top surface of an integrated circuit using a waveguide grating coupler, which is more effective as a fiber to chip connector. But there are difficulties in connecting an optical signal from a fiber to waveguide using a waveguide grating coupler, due to differences in cross sectional geometry, the number of optical modes and polarization characteristics.",
        "A circular cross section with a core diameter of less than ten microns is typical for a single mode fiber (SMF). A nanophotonic waveguide is typically rectangular in cross section and can be substantially smaller than one micron in both cross sectional dimensions. A waveguide grating coupler can be designed to make a usable connection between a fiber and a waveguide, even with their inherently different cross sectional and size characteristics.",
        "A typical SMF fiber can have a gaussian mode profile, with most of the power concentrated in the center of the light beam. A waveguide can be designed to support a gaussian type of mode profile with most of the power in the center of the waveguide. A waveguide grating coupler can provide a usable connection between a fiber and a waveguide, if they, have compatible gaussian mode profiles.",
        "A waveguide grating coupler can be designed to connect a fiber to a waveguide, even when a fiber and a waveguide have very different cross sectional, size and mode profile characteristics. But connecting an optical signal from a fiber to a waveguide can cause significant signal loss and distortion due to the typically different and incompatible polarization characteristics.",
        "An optical beam traveling in a single mode fiber (SMF) with circular cross section can typically be decomposed over an arbitrary basis of two orthogonal polarizations. These two orthogonal polarizations have approximately the same propagation constant and approximately the same group velocity in an optical fiber. Some refer to these two modes as a single mode with two polarization components. Within this discussion of the present invention, the two orthogonal polarizations are referred to as two modes.",
        "In theory and under ideal conditions, there is no exchange of power between the orthogonal polarizations in an SMF fiber. If an optical signal is directed into only one polarization, then all the power should remain in that polarization. But in actual practice, imperfections or strains in the fiber cause random power transfer between the two polarizations. The total power is thus divided between the two polarizations, and this may not be a problem in some applications, but in many situations, this can be a major problem. In some cases, there can be a great deal of fluctuation and power transfer between the two polarizations. Such random fluctuations can cause the power delivered on one polarization, to be close to zero, which would result in considerable loss of signal, if only that polarization is being received by a waveguide on a chip.",
        "Similarly, two orthogonal polarization modes are present in standard forms of polarization maintaining fibers. These two modes have sufficiently different phase and group velocities to prevent light from coupling back and forth between the two modes. But a typical waveguide cannot usually propagate both of the modes, which would result in some signal loss in such a fiber to waveguide connection.",
        "Typical integrated optical waveguides have a different type of modal configuration, where there are two types of modes: the transverse electric (TE) and the transverse magnetic (TM), which describe which field of the mode is oriented purely transversely to the direction of propagation. This is strictly true only for two dimensional ideal waveguides, however this naming convention is also used for real world three dimensional waveguides, which are only approximately TE or TM. Future references herein will make the common assumption that quasi-TE or quasi-TM modes are understood as TE or TM modes. A waveguide grating coupler can be designed to connect one polarization of an optical signal from a fiber to only one of the TE or TM modes. The other orthogonal polarization of the optical signal in the fiber would not be connected to the waveguide and any information transported by that polarization would be lost.",
        "As a result of the differences in polarization characteristics between fibers and waveguides, it has been difficult to connect optical signals from one to the other.",
        "One embodiment of the present invention is a polarization splitting grating coupler (PSGC), which provides a means for connecting an optical signal from an optical fiber to an optoelectronic integrated circuit. The PSGC separates a received optical signal into two orthogonal polarizations and directs the two polarizations to separate waveguides on an integrated circuit. Each of the two separated polarizations can then be processed, as needed for a particular application, by the integrated circuit. A PSGC can also operate in the reverse direction, and couple two optical signals from an integrated circuit to two respective orthogonal polarizations of one optical output signal sent off chip to an optical fiber.",

Polarization splitting grating coupler (herein \u201cPSGC\u201d) 100 is part of integrated circuit 101, which has been built on substrate 130. PSGC 100 connects light between optical element 105 and integrated circuit 101. In FIG. 1, optical element 105, such as an optical fiber, has been shown above and off to the side of integrated circuit 101 and thus is not intended to provide a figure of a system during operation. PSGC 100 includes cross grating 102, flared waveguides 110 and 120 and linear waveguides 113 and 123. Waveguides 113 and 123 connect optical signals to waveguides or other optical devices, not shown, on integrated circuit 101. The cross grating 102 includes many light scattering elements 106. The substrate 130 can be made of any of a variety of substrates such as: silicon, silicon on insulator (SOI), silicon on sapphire (SOS), silicon on nothing (SON) or a five layer substrate made of three layers of silicon with dielectric layers in between.",
        "The various waveguides in PSGC 100, such as flared waveguides 110 and 120, linear waveguide 113 and 123 and the waveguide portion of cross grating 102 are typically all fabricated of the same type of optical waveguide, which can include any one of the following: a strip loaded waveguide, a channel waveguide, a rib waveguide and a ridge waveguide. A strip loaded waveguide can be fabricated of a strip a slab and a low index transition layer between the lab. The cross grating 102 and PSGC 100 in their structure and operation can be understood as integrated waveguides disposed on substrate 130 and can be fabricated as one or a combination of the above mentioned types of waveguides.",
        "The relatively small number of light scattering elements 106 shown in FIG. 1 is merely illustrative and is not intended as limiting the number of light scattering elements in PSGC 100. A PSGC 100 can typically have hundreds or even thousands of light scattering elements 106. The light scattering elements 106 are positioned at the intersections of two sets of equally spaced rows 103 and 104, which in preferred embodiments are approximately orthogonal or nearly orthogonal to each other.

The rows 103 and 104 are curved and in preferred embodiments are equally spaced and elliptically or nearly elliptically curved. In other embodiments, the rows 103 and 104 can have other curvatures, such as those described by quadratic, hyperbolic, quartic or other mathematical functions.",
        "The positioning of the elements 106 in exemplary rows 103a and 104a is defined by curved lines, such as exemplary lines 118a and 128a. In some preferred embodiments, the spacing between the rows is uniform and the spacing between the elements in a row is also uniform. In some preferred embodiments, some of the light scattering elements are not positioned at the intersections of the curved rows 103 and 104 as defined by curved lines, such as curved lines 118a and 128a.",
        "The many light scattering elements 106 arranged in intersecting rows can be any of a variety of shapes and sizes, such as: a hole, a cylinder, a pillar, a conic section, a cube, a pyramid, a prism or a polyhedron. The light scattering elements can be formed in the substrate or on top of the substrate.",

In other embodiments, the light scattering elements can include elements made of semiconductor materials, dielectric materials and multi-layer structures made of a combination of semiconductor and dielectric layers. The light scattering elements 106 can be blazed at an angle which can be normal to the surface or at an angle to the surface of the integrated circuit 101.",
        "In other embodiments, the rows 103 and 104 of light scattering elements are not evenly spaced and the dimensions of the scatterers and the spacing between the scatterers within a row can be irregular and vary as may be needed for a particular application.",

FIG. 6 shows one section, along one axis of propagation, of cross gating 102 of PSGC 100 described previously and part of integrated circuit 101. Two exemplary light scattering elements 601a and 601b are positioned longitudinally along a line 602 (in the x direction) along with other light scattering elements.",
        "Above the cross grating 102, optical element 105 is positioned at an angle \u03b8 to the normal 107. These scatterers may correspond, for example, to the light scattering elements 106 of the cross grating 102 described previously. A normal line 107, in the z direction, is perpendicular to the line 602 of scatterers 601a, b. As a wave 610 travels along the line 602, it successively encounters the scatterers 601a and 601b. At each scatterer, portions of the wave 610 scatter in many directions. Two such scattered waves are depicted as parallel rays 611a and 611b directed at an angle \u03b8 with respect to the normal direction 107 and propagating in the direction of optical element 105. As is generally understood, a difference in path length 612 between the two rays 611a and 611b, from their respective scatterers 601a and 601b to a given perpendicular to the rays, i.e., line 614, can be expressed as D sin \u03b8, where D is the spacing between the scatterers 601a and 601b. If the scatterers 601a, b are sources that emit waves in phase, a coherent wavefront is produced such as represented by the perpendicular line 614. The dynamics of this wave are governed in part by the well known equation D sin \u03b8=m\u03bb, where \u03bb is the wavelength, and m is an integer.",
        "It is useful to consider the path length difference from a point before the scatterer 601a to the wavefront 614 of NCGD\u2212NSDD sin \u03b8, since the scattered waves originate from the same original wave 610. In this equation, NCG and NSD correspond to the refractive indices of the cross grating 102 and of a typical silicon dioxide layer covering the cross grating, respectively. Thus, the condition NCGD\u2212NSDD sin \u03b8=m\u03bb, is relevant to the coherent wavefronts produced by the cross grating 102. Accordingly, the spacing D between two light scattering elements and the wavelength \u03bb determines the angle \u03b8 of propagation of the resulting coherent wavefronts. The aforementioned condition for producing a coherent wavefront can also be expressed in terms of phases of the scattered waves as differing by multiples of 2 m \u03c0 radians at the wavefront.",
        "It will be appreciated that the foregoing scattering principle can be extended into two dimensions, for example, along a direction (y) into the plane in FIG. 6. Thus, the scatterers 601a, b depicted in FIG. 6 can represent a cross-sectional view of a cross grating described herein where many light scattering elements are disposed longitudinally along an axis of propagation of cross grating 102. Furthermore, while the description above, in reference to FIG. 6 relates to a scattering process from the line 602, coincident with the top of the substrate, the principle is also applicable to the reverse process where the scatterers receive the wave directed at an angle of \u03b8 and scatter light along the line 602.",

        "Polarization selectivity by the PSGC 100 can be determined by an evaluation of coupling between the modes in the fiber and the modes in the waveguide. The k space selection rules, also known as the wavevector selection rules, discussed above can provide discrimination between the different modes in a waveguide by choosing the propagation constant to couple to.

Thus modes E1 and E2 will primarily couple to waveguide modes of matching electric field orientation. Waveguide \u03b21 is waveguide 110 in FIG. 1 and it has its electric field in the x direction, and will primarily couple to mode E1. Waveguide \u03b22 is waveguide 120 in FIG. 1 and it has its electric field in the y direction, and will primarily couple to mode E2.",
        "Polarization selectivity in this manner is not a selection rule, but a rule of thumb, and there could be some crosstalk. Crosstalk can occur for primarily two reasons. One reason is that each of the modes E1 and E2 are not exactly in alignment with the respective x and y axes. The second reason is that a guided wave in a waveguide grating is not a simple waveguide mode, but can be a much more complex Bloch wave with electric fields in all three directions.",
        "FIG. 9 schematically illustrates an analysis of a section of PSGC 100, which can be used to determine the shape of curved rows 103 and 104, according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 9 shows a PSGC 100, with cross grating 102 with row 103a, flared waveguides 110 and 120 and linear waveguides 113 and 123. For the purpose of simplifying the diagram, only one row 103a of the rows 103 and 104 is shown in FIG. 9. Lines 116 and 126 represent circularly cylindrical wavefronts of light propagating through respective flared waveguides 110 and 120. Lines 117 and 127 represent planar wavefronts of light propagating through respective linear waveguides 113 and 123.",
        "Cross grating 102 can be designed to focus one polarization of light in-plane to linear waveguide 113 via flared waveguide 110. The design of PSGC 100 can focus the other polarization of light to flared waveguide 120 and linear waveguide 123. Cross grating 102 along with flared waveguides 110 and 120 can be considered as focusing horns.",
        "The curvature of rows 103 and 104, as shown in FIG. 1, is defined by respective curved lines 118 and 128. An analysis of a PSGC 100 with flared waveguide 110 can generate the set of curved lines 118, which provide the shape of the curved rows 103 of PSGC 100. Such an analysis is similarly applicable to flared waveguide 120, curved lines 128 and curved rows 104. The analysis presented is applicable to light propagating in either direction along either axis of propagation.",
        "The phase map of the vector field expanding out of linear waveguide 113 from point A to point B is:\n\n\u03c61(r)=\u03b21|r\u2212rA|\u2003\u2003(11)\n\nwhere r is an in-plane position in the grating coupler. The phase map has to be matched to the fiber mode profile:\n\n\u03c6F(r)=kFP\u00b7r\u2003\u2003(12)\n\nyielding the following equation:\n\n\u03c61(r)=\u03c6F(r)+2m\u03c0\u2003\u2003(13)\n\nwhere m is an integer. Equation 13 yields a family of ellipses with one of two foci at the input point A. A similar group of ellipses can be derived for the other waveguides 120 and 123. A group of ellipses based on a pair of foci with the same shape and cross sectional proportions are known as concentric homothetic ellipses. Equation 13 can be used to generate such a group of ellipses.",
        "Curved lines 118 are segments of equally spaced concentric homothetic elliptical curves as determined by equation 13 above for flared waveguide 110. Similarly, curved lines 128 are segments of equally spaced concentric homothetic elliptical curves as determined by equation 13 above for flared waveguide 120. The intersection of the two sets of curved lines 118 and 128 determines the location of light scattering elements 106, which include rows 103 and 104. The cross grating 102 is fabricated by placing light scattering elements such as pillars or by etching holes at the intersection of any two of the sets of ellipses, as shown, in FIG. 9.",
        "The curved grating rows can be a source of crosstalk because the elliptical curvature of the phase fronts can introduce small components of the electric field of the in-plane waves.",
        "In addition to the three main design parameters discussed above, there are other design parameters that one skilled in the art will be cognizant of and can be taken into consideration in the overall design of a PSGC. These parameters include: sizing and placement of the grating coupler with respect to the optical fiber in order to minimize the scattering of light out of any unilluminated light scattering elements which are not receiving light from the fiber. There is an optimum distance from the fiber core to the grating edge in both dimensions.",
        "The periodicity and size and shape of the light scattering elements 106 can be modified to account for other phenomenon. Complex higher order effects, such as those caused by Bloch waves, can be considered to improve efficiency. The introduction of light scattering holes can decrease the effective index of the waveguide in the grating coupler, which can result in an increase in the grating period as compared to the grating period computed using the standard waveguide propagation constant \u03b2.",
        "The shapes and sizes of the holes or pillars used as light scattering elements can be non-homogeneous, and they can be engineered to increase coupling efficiency and reduce crosstalk. Holes with different scattering cross sections in different directions, such as elongated holes, may be useful in some applications. The desired shape of the holes as compared to what is possible given the available fabrication techniques should also be taken into account during the design process. A square hole will typically be fabricated with rounded corners. A square hole with angular corners, could be made using a process such as optical proximity correction.",
        "The eccentricity of the ellipses can be modified to account for the propagation constant mismatch between the grating and the flared waveguide. The curved rows can be designed as non-elliptic. The angle between the two flared waveguides can be non-orthogonal to try to reduce the crosstalk.",
        "The layers within the structure of the grating coupler can be modified to increase efficiency. The waveguide in the grating coupler can include multiple high index layers. For example, the waveguide can include two high index layers, one of which is patterned while the other is not. Multiple layers can be patterned to form a multi-layered grating coupler.",
        "Distributed Bragg Reflectors (DBR) can also be fabricated below and/or above the grating coupler to enhance the efficiency of the grating. A single dielectric interface below the grating could block the absorption of some light into the substrate. A microcavity could improve the efficiency of a PSGC by using various elements such as: anti-reflection layers, buried mirrors, DBRs and other layers above and below the grating.",
        "The design process for optical paths comprises construction of maskworks. Maskworks include shapes, layout, data structures, netlists, and alignment marks and other elements of the design which are typically stored as digital data on a computer system. In addition, these electronic representations of the designs are transferred to a set of many physical masks which are used during the fabrication of the components. These many masks are included in the definition of maskworks.",
        "A particularly advantageous aspect of the present invention is that a PSGC can connect an optical signal to an optoelectronic integrated circuit. A PSGC splits the optical input signal into two orthogonal polarizations and connects the two polarizations to separate waveguides on the integrated circuit. The two polarizations can be processed by separate signal processing systems. These signal processing systems can process the two polarizations in an identical or non-identical manner, as needed for a particular application.",
        "Although the present invention has been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."
