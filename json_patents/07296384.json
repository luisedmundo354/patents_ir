No. 7,174,683, which claims benefit to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/404,459, filed Aug. 19, 2002, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/397,515, filed Jul. 19, 2002, the entire specifications of all of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.",
        "This patent application claims priority to and all advantages of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 60/397,515 and 60/404,459, which were filed on Jul. 19, 2002 and Aug. 19, 2002, respectively.",
        "The subject invention generally relates to a shutter assembly. More specifically, the subject invention relates to an impact-resistant shutter assembly that does not fracture upon impact from debris.",
        "As is known in the art, shutters are used for both aesthetic and functional purposes on a dwelling, such as a residential or commercial building. Aesthetically, shutters are utilized to add d\u00e9cor and character to the dwelling. Although these decorative types of shutters typically remain in an open position on the dwelling, they create an appearance of being a functional shutter.",
        "On the other hand, in a closed position, the shutters are used for functional purposes. These functional shutters typically include a decorative panel and a support panel backing, or supporting, the decorative panel. These functional shutters pivot from the open position to the closed position and operate to protect windows, doors, and other openings of the dwelling during inclement weather, such as precipitation storms, wind storms, and hurricanes.",
        "However, the shutters of the prior art are deficient. More specifically, because the decorative shutters are not intended for functional purposes, they are manufactured from raw materials that do not provide adequate protection to dwellings. The functional shutters of the prior art, even in the closed position, are deficient in that they do not satisfy ASTM Standard Specifications for \u201cStorm Shutters\u201d as required according to the International Building Code (IBC). These shutters are not impact-resistant. Instead, these shutters fracture upon impact from debris, such as windborne debris that is particularly active during the inclement weather. Ultimately, the conventional shutters do not adequately protect the windows, doors, and other openings of the dwelling during the inclement weather.",
        "Some shutters have attempted to incorporate certain compositions into the decorative panel and the support panel to bolster the impact resistance provided by the shutter. However, these attempts have not compatibilized the compositions between the decorative panel and the support panel. As a result, the support panel may not be adequately bonded to the decorative panel such that the support panel does not adequately back, or support, the decorative panel, and the decorative panel frequently fractures independent of the support panel.",
        "Due to the deficiencies in the shutters of the prior art, including those described above, it is desirable to provide a novel shutter assembly that satisfies the ASTM Standard Specifications as required by the IBC such that the shutter assembly is impact-resistant and does not fracture upon impact from debris.",
        "An impact-resistant shutter assembly is disclosed. In one embodiment of the subject invention, the shutter assembly includes a decorative panel having an outer surface and an inner surface and a support panel having a first surface and a second surface. The decorative panel comprises a first chemical composition and the support panel comprises a fiber composition that is incompatible with the first chemical composition.",
        "A second chemical composition is integrated into the support panel at the first surface. The second chemical composition is compatible with the first chemical composition of the decorative panel. As such, the fiber composition in the support panel can be bonded to the inner surface of the decorative panel. The fiber composition in the support panel provides impact resistance to the decorative panel to prevent fracturing of the decorative panel upon impact from debris.",
        "In a further embodiment of the subject invention, the fiber composition in the support panel comprises at least one of polypropylene fibers, polyester fibers, and aromatic polyamide fibers. These fibers provide the impact resistance to the decorative panel to prevent any fracturing.",
        "In yet a further embodiment of the subject invention, the decorative panel comprises polyvinyl chloride. The fiber composition in the support panel is incompatible with the polyvinyl chloride. In this particular embodiment, polyvinyl chloride is integrated into the support panel at the first surface, and a solvent cement is disposed between the first surface of the support panel and the inner surface of the decorative panel. The solvent cement bonds the fiber composition to the inner surface of the decorative panel through interaction with the polyvinyl chloride of the support panel.",
        "Accordingly, the subject invention provides a shutter assembly that is impact-resistant and does not fracture upon impact from debris. It is also advantageous that, in the shutter assembly of the subject invention, the compositions of the support panel and the decorative panel are compatible such that the support panel can adequately bond to the decorative panel to prevent fracturing of the decorative panel upon impact from debris.",
        "Other advantages of the present invention will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein:",
        "FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a dwelling having one impact-resistant shutter assembly in an open position and one impact-resistant shutter assembly in a closed position;",

        "FIG. 6 is an exploded perspective view of a raised panel shutter assembly according to the subject invention illustrating stiles that are coupled to outer surfaces of the decorative panel and the second decorative panel; and",
        "FIG. 7 is an exploded perspective view of a board-and-batten shutter assembly according to the subject invention illustrating a channel and a strengthening element disposed within the channel.",
        "Referring to the Figures, wherein like numerals indicate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views, an impact-resistant shutter assembly is generally disclosed at 10. The shutter assembly 10 is used for both aesthetic and functional purposes on a dwelling 12, such as a residential building (as disclosed in FIG. 1) or a commercial building. The shutter assembly 10 is mounted to the dwelling 12 via a plurality of fasteners, such as hinges and screws and the like. These fasteners are not disclosed in the Figures as they are not pertinent to the subject invention. The shutter assembly 10 of the subject invention is used functionally to pivot from an open position to a closed position to protect windows, doors, and other openings of the dwelling 12 during inclement weather, such as precipitation storms, wind storms, and hurricanes. In FIG. 1, one shutter assembly 10 is disclosed in an open position, and the other shutter assembly 10 is disclosed in the closed position. The shutter assemblies 10 are pivotable between the open position and the closed position. The shutter assembly 10 functions to protect the dwelling 12 by absorbing impact from debris, such as windborne debris that is particularly active during inclement weather.",
        "It is to be understood that one shutter assembly 10 according to the subject invention is a single shutter. That is, one shutter assembly 10 is one left side shutter or one right side shutter such that two shutter assemblies 10 are preferred to adequately protect the dwelling 12. Referring particularly to FIGS. 2A-2E, the shutter assembly 10 is disclosed as a shutter assembly 10 that is commonly referred to as a raised panel shutter assembly 10. FIGS. 2A-2E illustrate various configurations, or styles, of the raised panel shutter assembly 10. On the other hand, referring particularly to FIGS. 3A-3E, the shutter assembly 10 is disclosed as a shutter assembly 10 that is commonly referred to as a board-and-batten shutter assembly 10. FIGS. 3A-3E illustrate various configurations, or styles, of the board-and-batten shutter assembly 10.",
        "The shutter assembly 10 includes a decorative panel 14 and a support panel 16. For the descriptive purposes of the subject invention, use of the terminology panel is synonymous with the terminology layer. The decorative panel 14 has an outer surface 18 and an inner surface 20. Although not required, it is preferred that the decorative panel 14 has a thickness ranging from 12 to 19, preferably from 13 to 16, mm. Also, the decorative panel 14 includes a first chemical composition. In preferred embodiments of the subject invention, the first chemical composition is further defined as a first thermoplastic resin composition, including polyvinyl chloride (PVC). As understood by those skilled in the art, a thermoplastic resin composition is capable of softening when heated and hardening, or re-setting, again when cooled. One suitable decorative panel 14 is commercially available as Komatex\u00ae from Kommerling of Huntsville, Ala. It is to be understood that, instead of PVC, the first chemical composition may include chemical and functional equivalents of PVC including, but not limited to, polyvinyl acetate (PVAc).",
        "The support panel 16 has a first surface and a second surface. For clarification in the Figures, the first and second surfaces of the support panel are disclosed but not numbered. Although not required, it is preferred that the support panel 16 has a thickness of approximately 0.080 inches, or from 1.5 to 3 mm. Ultimately, the first surface of the support panel 16 is bonded to the inner surface 20 of the decorative panel 14. This bond is described additionally below. The support panel 16 includes a fiber composition that is different from, and incompatible with, the first chemical composition of the decorative panel 14. The fiber composition of the support panel 16 is incompatible with the first chemical composition in that the fiber composition cannot be directly bonded to the first chemical composition. The fiber composition comprises at least one of polypropylene fibers, polyester fibers, and aromatic polyamide fibers. These fibers cannot be directly bonded to the first chemical composition, e.g. to the PVC, of the decorative panel 14.",
        "It is also preferred that the fiber composition of the support panel 16 further include glass fibers, i.e., fiber glass. If included, the glass fibers are preferably continuous filament glass fibers to maximize the impact resistance provided by the fiber composition to the decorative panel 14. However, although it is not preferred, the glass fibers included in the fiber composition may include common chopped fibers, and the like.",
        "In one embodiment of the subject invention, the fiber composition of the support panel 16 includes the polypropylene fibers and the glass fibers. In another embodiment of the subject invention, the fiber composition of the support panel 16 includes the polyester fibers and the glass fibers. In a further embodiment of the subject invention, the fiber composition of the support panel 16 includes a blend of the polypropylene fibers and the polyester fibers and the glass fibers. In yet a further embodiment of the subject invention, the fiber composition of the support panel 16 includes the aromatic polyamide fibers. If included in the fiber composition, the aromatic polyamide fibers are formed from poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide, which is a nylon-like polymer commercially available as Kevlar\u00ae from DuPont of Wilmington, Del. Of course, aromatic polyamide fibers other than Kevlar\u00ae are suitable for use in the fiber composition of the subject invention.",
        "One suitable support panel 16 is commercially available as Bulitex\u00ae from U.S. Liner Company, a division of American Made, LLC, of Ambridge, Pa. Bulitex\u00ae is a thermoplastic composite having a fiber composition that includes continuous, woven fiberglass. In addition to the continuous, woven fiberglass, the fiber composition of Bulitex\u00ae also includes the polypropylene fibers, the polyester fibers, or combinations thereof. Alternatively, Kevlar\u00ae panels may also be utilized as the support panel 16.",
        "The shutter assembly 10 of the subject invention further includes a second chemical composition 22. The second chemical composition 22 is integrated into the support panel 16 at the first surface of the support panel 16. The second chemical composition 22 is compatible with the first chemical composition of the decorative panel 14. As such, the fiber composition of the support panel 16 can be bonded to the inner surface 20 of the decorative panel 14. The fiber composition bonds to the inner surface 20 of the decorative panel 14 as described below. In this position, where the support panel 16 is bonded to the decorative panel 14, the fiber composition in the support panel 16 provides impact resistance to the decorative panel 14 thereby preventing fracturing of the decorative panel 14 upon impact from debris.",
        "In preferred embodiments of the subject invention, the second chemical composition 22, which is integrated into the support panel 16 at the first surface of the support panel 16, is further defined as a second thermoplastic resin composition, including PVC. As with the first chemical composition, it is to be understood that, instead of PVC, the second chemical composition 22 may include chemical and functional equivalents of PVC including, but not limited to, polyvinyl acetate (PVAc). Furthermore, although it is not required, it is most preferred that the first chemical composition and the second chemical composition 22 are identical to optimize the compatibility between the decorative panel 14 and the support panel 16.",
        "Although the fiber composition of the support panel 16 is incompatible with the first chemical composition, the fiber composition is not incompatible with the second chemical composition 22 because the second chemical composition 22 is actually integrated into the support panel 16 at the first surface during manufacturing of the support panel 16 with the fiber composition.
