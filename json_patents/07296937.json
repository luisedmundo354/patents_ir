        "The invention relates generally to a pluggable electronic transceiver module assembly, and more particularly, to a module assembly with a switch built therein to detect when the module assembly is being unplugged from a receptacle assembly.",
        "Various types of fiber optic and copper based transceivers are known that permit communication between electronic host equipment and external devices. These transceivers may be incorporated into cable assembly modules that can be pluggably connected to host equipment to provide flexibility in system configuration. The cable assembly modules are constructed according to various standards for size and compatibility, one standard being the Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP) module standard. An SFP module is plugged into a receptacle that is mounted on a circuit board within host equipment. The receptacle includes an elongated guide frame, or cage, having a front that is open to an interior space, and an electrical connector disposed at a rear of the interior space of the cage. Both the connector and the guide frame are electrically and mechanically connected to the circuit board such that, when an SFP module is plugged into a receptacle, the SFP module also becomes electrically and mechanically connected to the circuit board. Conventional SFP modules and receptacles typically carry data signals at rates up to 2.5 gigabits per second (Gbps). A standard currently in development for a next generation of SFP modules, presently called the XFP standard, calls for the transceiver modules to carry data signals at rates up to 10 Gbps.",
        "In certain applications, it is desirable to unplug the cable assembly module while the system is operational and the cable assembly module is supporting a communications link with the system. It is undesirable to unplug the cable assembly module while being used to convey data. Instead, it is preferable to shut-down the communications link before unplugging a corresponding cable assembly module.",
        "However, conventional systems offer limited methods and structures for performing automatic shut-down of a communications link or for detecting the presence or absence of a cable assembly module. Conventional module detection methods determine that a cable assembly module is being removed at or after the point in time, at which the transceiver in the cable assembly module is electrically disconnected from the circuit board. The conventional module detection methods do not provide sufficient time for the system to shut down the communications link before unplugging the cable assembly module.",
        "A need exists for methods and systems to determine when a cable assembly module is about to be unplugged early in the removal process.",
        "In accordance with one embodiment, an electrical module assembly is provided that is configured for latching engagement with a receptacle assembly.

As explained below, the latch elements 196 engage latch surfaces on the module assembly 102 to lock the module assembly 102 in the receptacle assembly 104. The bottom wall 130 has a bottom opening to receive the receptacle connector 120. The circuit board within the module assembly 102 includes contact pads that engage contacts 121 within the receptacle connector 120 to form signal paths over which one or more communications links are established and maintained by the host system. When the module assembly 102 is inserted into the receptacle assembly 104, the guide frame 122 provides conductive walls on all sides thereof. The host board 106 includes a conductive surface provided thereon and formed as a sheet to underlie the receptacle assembly 104 to enhance the electromagnetic interference shielding.",

The retention cavity 290 includes a latch surface 301 between the second and third portions 298 and 300. The latch elements 196 on the guide frame 122 (FIG. 1) engage the latch surfaces 301 to lock the module assembly 102 in the receptacle module 104.",
        "In the example of FIG. 2, the base 112 and cover 114 fit together to define the interior cavity. The retention cavity 290 on side wall 294 (not visible in FIG. 2), that receives the actuator arm 184 with the switch actuator arm 267, includes an opening into the interior cavity within the base 112 and cover 114. The opening is located in the second and third portions 298 and 300 of the side wall 294. When the actuator arm 184 is loaded into the retention cavity 290 on the side wall 294, the switch actuator arm 267 extends through the opening in the second and third portions 298 and 300. The structure and operation of the switch actuator arm 267 are described in more detail below.",
        "During use, as the module assembly 102 is inserted into the receptacle assembly 104, the ejector tabs 266 contact the latch elements 196 (shown in FIG. 1) of the guide frame 122 and deflect the latch elements 196 outwardly to allow the module assembly 102 to be inserted into the guide frame 122. When the module assembly 102 is fully inserted, the ejector tabs 266 clear the latch elements 196, and the latch elements 196 deflect inwardly upon the tapered leading ends 278 of the actuator arms 184. The latch surfaces 301 therefore become latched behind the latch elements 196 of the guide frame 122 when the module assembly 102 is fully installed in the guide frame 122.",
        "In the latched position, the bail 182 is positioned substantially upright with the foot portions 262 of the bail 182 contacting the foot portions 270 of the actuator arms 184 at an obtuse angle. The latched contact stop portions 272 of the actuator arms 184 contact the sides 254, 256 of the bail 182. The bias elements 286 are loaded in compression and maintain the bail 182 in the latched position. As the bail 182 is pivoted in the direction of arrow G away from the connector interface 124 about the bottom side 252, the foot portions 262 of the bail 182 slide upwardly against the foot portions 270 of the actuator arms 184 in the direction of arrow H to form a right angle between the foot portions 270 and 262. When moving from the obtuse to the right angle orientation, the foot portions 262 of the bail 182 cause the actuator arms 184 to move longitudinally inward into the retention cavities 290 in the direction of arrow J, thereby further loading the bias elements 286 in the actuator arms 184.",
        "Further pivoting of the bail 182 begins to move the foot portions 262 into an obtuse orientation and away from the foot portions 270 which permits the bias elements 286 to relax and push the actuator arms 184 forward in the direction of arrow K toward the connector interface 124. At this point, the latch elements 196 of the guide frame 122 are in contact with the ramped surfaces 280 of the ejector tabs 266 of the actuator arms 184. As the bias elements 286 force the actuator arms 184 in a forward direction of arrow K, the ramped surfaces 280 deflect the latch elements 196 outwardly out of retention cavities 290 until the bosses 282 and latch surfaces 301 clear the latch elements 196. The actuator arms 184 are displaced forwardly by the bias elements 286, and the ejector tabs 266 are released from the latch elements 196 of the guide frame 122. In the unlatched position, the module assembly 102 may be removed from the receptacle assembly 104 by pulling the bail 182 to slide the module assembly 102 out of the receptacle assembly 104. The bias elements 286 maintain the bail 182 in the latched position until the bail 182 is rotated. The bail 182 may be pivoted back toward the connector interface 124 to position the actuator arms 184 back to the latched position wherein the ejector tabs 266 engage the latch elements 196 of the receptacle assembly 104.",
        "FIG. 3 illustrates a side elevation view of a portion of the module assembly 102 with the cover 114 removed. As shown in FIG. 3, the base 112 includes sidewalls 292 and 294 that are separated by an interior cavity 293. The interior cavity 293 receives a module board, such as printed circuit board 295. The circuit board 295 has a top surface 297 that is populated with active and passive components and includes contact pads 299 that are configured to be joined to wires or contacts of a cable assembly, mating plug and the like. The contact pads 299 are joined to traces 289 that extend along the top surface 297. The top surface 297 also includes a present pin contact pad 401 and a power contact pad 402. The present pin contact pad 401 and power contact pad 402 are joined to corresponding switch signal traces 403 and 404, respectively, that extend along the length of the circuit board 295, to be connected to electronics provided on the host circuit board 106 (FIG. 1).",
        "A detection switch 406 is mounted proximate to a lead end 287 of the circuit board 295. The detection switch 406 is engaged and released by the switch engagement tip 269 of the switch actuator arm 267 as the actuator arm 184 is linearly moved along the directions denoted by arrows A and B between latched and unlatched states or positions, respectively. The detection switch 406 monitors a position of the release mechanism 180 and provides latched and unlatched state signals over the switch signal traces 403 and 404 based on the position of the release mechanism 180. The latched state signal indicates that the module housing 110 is fully locked in the guide frame 122. The unlatched state signal indicates that the release mechanism 180 is being moved to the unlocked position. The detection switch 406 generates the unlatched state signal at some time interval before signal contacts on circuit board 295 disconnect from contacts 121 in the receptacle connector 120. For example, the detection switch 406 may generate the unlatched state signal when the bail 182 initially begins to move the release mechanism 180 in the unlatching direction of arrow B from the locked position toward the unlocked position.",
        "The detection switch 406 includes a spring element 408 having a base portion 410 and a V-shaped body 412 formed integrally at a hinge area 416 with the base portion 410. A dielectric member 420 is provided on the V-shaped body 412 at a position to engage the release mechanism 180 to maintain an insulation interface between the switch spring element 408 and the switch engagement tip 269 of the switch actuator arm 267. The V-shaped body 412 has outer tip portions 414 that are positioned above the power contact pad 402. The V-shaped body 412 pivots at the hinge area 416 along arcuate paths denoted by arrows C and D between open and closed positions, respectively, with the power contact pad 402.",
        "FIG. 4 illustrates a side elevation view opposite to the view of FIG. 3 of the detection switch element 406 and switch actuator arm 267. When the switch actuator arm 267 is slid in the direction of arrow A toward the switch spring element 408, the switch engagement tip 269 engages the dielectric member 420 and forces the outer tip portions 414 of the V-shaped body 412 downward along path C into engagement with the power contact pad 402, thereby establishing a closed position. When the outer tip portions 414 engage the power contact pad 402, a closed circuit is formed between the present pin contact pad 401 and the power contact pad 402. When the closed circuit is formed, a latched state signal is conveyed to electronic components on the host board 106 or host system indicating that the module assembly 102 is fully plugged into the receptacle assembly 104.",
        "As shown in FIG. 4, the base portion 410 is secured to the circuit board 295 with a curved clip formed at end 418 that wraps about the lead end 287 of the circuit board 295. Alternatively, the base portion 410 may be secured by solder or other means to the contact circuit pad 401.",
        "FIG. 5 illustrates the detection switch 406 and the switch actuator arm 267 when moved relative to the module housing 110 to the open circuit or fully unlatched position. When the switch actuator arm 267 is moved to the fully unlatched position, the switch engagement tip 269 is spaced apart from the dielectric member 420. The base portion 410 and the V-shaped body 412 are formed with a predetermined obtuse angle 417 therebetween at the hinge area 416, such that, when the switch actuator arm 267 is slid in the direction of arrow B toward the unplugged position, the outer tip portions 414 of the V-shaped body 412 rotate along path D upward and away from the power contact pad 402. When the outer tip portions 414 disengage from the power contact pad 402, an open circuit is formed between the switch contact pad 401 and the power contact pad 402. When the open circuit is formed, an unlatched state signal is conveyed to electronic components on the host board 106 (FIG. 1) indicating that the module assembly 102 is about to be unplugged from the receptacle assembly 104.",
        "The dimensions and spacing of the actuator arm 184, switch actuator arm 267, ejector tabs 266 and detection switch 406 are configured such that the outer tip portions 414 disengage from the power contact pad 402 before or substantially simultaneously with disengagement of the ejector tabs 266 from the latched position, thereby providing the unlatched state signal before the module assembly 102 is unplugged from the receptacle assembly 104, by a predetermined minimum shut-down time interval. For example, it may be desirable to provide the unlatched state signal by a minimum shut-down time interval of approximately between 50 and 500 milliseconds before contacts within the module assembly 102 and receptacle assembly 104 electrically disconnect from one another. As a further example, it may be desirable to provide the unlatched state signal by a predetermined shut-down time interval of approximately 100 milliseconds before contacts within the module assembly 102 and receptacle assembly 104 electrically disconnect from one another.",
        "FIG. 6 is a perspective view of a module assembly 310 formed in accordance with an alternative embodiment. The module assembly 310 includes a release mechanism 312 that includes a pair of actuator arms 314 which are constructed in a substantially similar manner to one another. Each actuator arm 314 extends within a retention cavity 316 formed within corresponding side walls 318 of the module assembly 310. The actuator arms 314 extend longitudinally along the side walls 318, and the actuator arms 314 cooperate with a bail 320 to release the module assembly 310 from the receptacle assembly 104 as described below.",
        "At least one of the actuator arms 314 include a switch actuator arm similar to the switch actuator arm 267 shown in FIGS. 2-5. The module assembly 310 includes half shells forming a base 311 and a cover 313, that collectively define an interior cavity. The interior cavity within the module assembly 310 includes a circuit board having a detection switch thereon that is similar to the detection switch 406 in FIGS. 2-5.",
        "The bail 320 includes a top side 322 extending transversely across the module assembly 310 between the side walls 318, and two opposing lateral sides 324 which extend downward from the top side 322 in a plane parallel to the side walls 318 of the module assembly 310. The top side 322 and lateral sides 324 are dimensioned to receive a connector interface 326 of the module assembly 310 which provides a site for connection to a cable assembly 327, which may include an optical fiber or electrical cable, strain relief features, etc. The connector interface 326 includes an aperture (not shown) on each lateral side of the module assembly 310, and each of the lateral sides 324 of the bail includes an inward facing cylindrical pin (not shown) which fits into the apertures to pivotally or rotatably mount the lateral sides 324 of the bail 320 to the module assembly 310.",
        "In an exemplary embodiment, the front end 328 of the module assembly 310 includes notched corners 330 that facilitate operation of the bail 320 as described below. The lateral sides 324 of the bail include downwardly extending vertical portions 332 extending substantially perpendicularly to the horizontal top side 322 at either end thereof. Horizontal shelf portions 334 extend in a perpendicular orientation from the vertical portions 332 but in the same plane as the vertical portions 332 of the bail 320, and vertical actuator portions 336 extend from the shelf portions 334 in a parallel arrangement to the vertical portions 332. A hook portion 338 extends from distal ends of each of the actuator portions 336 of the bail 320, and the hook portions 338 include engagement ledges 340 extending opposite the actuator portions 336.",
        "The actuator arms 314 include a main body portion 342 including an axially extending ejector tab 344, and a foot portion 345 extending substantially perpendicularly to the main body portion 342. The main body portion 342 includes a tapered leading end 346 which has a gradually reduced thickness to form a ramped surface extending to the ejector tab 344. The ejector tab 344 has a reduced width relative to the main body portion 342 and includes a ramped surface 348 extending to a raised boss 350. The ramped surface 348 of the ejector tab 344 is inclined oppositely to the tapered leading end 346 of the actuator arms 314.",
        "The foot portion 345 of the actuator arms 314 includes a vertical opening or slot 354 which defines an engagement surface 352 for the hook 338 of the bail 320. As illustrated in FIG. 6, the bail 320 is rotated about the front end 328 of the module assembly 310 in the direction of arrow E until the ledge 340 of the hook 338 is in contact with the engagement surface 352 of the slot 354 in the actuator arms 314. When the module assembly 310 is inserted into receptacle assembly 104, the latch elements 196 of the guide frame 122 are in contact with latch surfaces 351 in the retention cavities 316.",
        "As the bail 320 continues to be rotated in the direction of arrow E, the engagement of the ledges 340 and the hooks 338 displace or pull the actuator arms 314 in a direction of arrow B which extends parallel to a longitudinal axis of the module assembly 310. As the actuator arms 314 are moved in the forward direction of Arrow B, the ramped surfaces 348 outwardly deflect the latch elements 196 of the guide frame 122 until the latch surfaces 351 and bosses 350 clear and the latch elements 196 and the retention tabs 266 are released from the latch elements 196 of the guide frame 122. In the unlatched position, the module assembly 310 may be removed from the receptacle assembly 104 by continuing to pull the bail 320 in the direction of arrow E to slide the module assembly 310 out of the receptacle assembly 104.",
        "Due to direct engagement of the hooks 338 of the bail 320 and the slots 354 of the actuator arms 314, release of the module assembly 310 from a receptacle assembly 104 is accomplished without internal spring elements. Manufacturing and assembly costs are therefore reduced while nonetheless providing an effective and reliable latch and release mechanism.",
        "FIG. 7 is a side view of the module assembly 310 with the cover 313 removed. A circuit board 516 is shown with signal contacts 512 located proximate to a forward end 514 thereof. The signal contacts 512 engage contacts 121 (FIG. 1) in the receptacle connector 120. The bail 320 and actuator arm 314 are in the fully locked or plugged position. FIG. 7 illustrates a switch actuator arm 367 provided on the outer end of the actuator arm 314. The switch actuator arm 367 includes a switch engagement tip 369 that engages dielectric member 520 on detection switch 506. As explained above, the dimensions and spacing of the actuator arm 314, switch actuator arm 367, ejector tabs 350 and detection switch 506 are configured such that the detection switch 506 generates an unlatched state signal before or substantially simultaneously with an initial movement of the actuator arm 314, thereby providing the unlatch state signal well before the contacts 512 on the forward end 514 of the circuit board 516 are disconnected from the contacts 121 in receptacle assembly 104, by a minimum shut-down time interval.",
        "FIG. 8 illustrates a schematic diagram of an unlatch detection circuit 550 implemented in connection with an embodiment of the present invention. The circuit 550 includes a host board 106 that is electrically joined to a circuit or module board, such as circuit board 295 (FIG. 3). When the circuit board 295 is joined to the host board 106, power source Vcc contact 552, present pin 554 and ground contact 556 are interconnected therebetween. Traces 556, 558 and 560 extend from the power source Vcc contact 552, present pin 554 and ground contact 556 along the length of the circuit board 295. The power source Vcc contact 552 and present pin 554 terminate at a power contact pad and a present pin contact pad, such as power contact pad 402 and present pin contact pad 401 (FIG. 3), respectively.",
        "FIG. 8 illustrates a detection switch 570 that corresponds to the unlatch switch 406. The detection switch 570 is a normally open switch. When the detection switch 570 is closed, a \u201clatched\u201d state signal is provided along trace 558 to the present pin 554. The \u201clatched\u201d state signal indicates that the release mechanism is in a fully latched position. When the detection switch 570 is open, an \u201cunlatched\u201d state signal is provided along trace 558 to the present pin 554. The \u201cunlatched\u201d state signal may constitute a first voltage level determined by the initial voltage Vcc and the voltage drop across resistor 572. The \u201cunlatched\u201d state signal indicates that the release mechanism is not in a fully latched position. The \u201cunlatched\u201d state signal may be generated at various stages throughout an unplugging operation of the module assembly 102 from the receptacle assembly 104. For, example, in the embodiment of FIG. 6, the \u201cunlatched\u201d state signal may be generated before or after the ejector tabs 350 fully disengage from the receptacle assembly 104.",
        "In the above examples, the detection switches are normally open switches. Optionally, the switch actuator arm and detection switch may be modified to operate as a normally closed switch when in the unlatched position. Optionally, the switch actuator arm may be constructed to directly bridge the power and present pin contact pads. Optionally, the detection switch may produce signals described above. Optionally, the release mechanism may not directly engage the detection switch, but instead change the detection switch state through magnetic, optical or infrared means.",
        "While the invention has been described in terms of various specific embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the claims."
