The differential distance of the mirror recorded for each fringe burst provides the differential optical path length (differential optical path length=c*delta time/ngr where ngr is the group index of the light in that medium and c is the velocity of the light in a vacuum. Group index is defined to be the ratio of the propagation velocity of a light pulse in a vacuum relative to the velocity of propagation of a pulse in the medium) for the device under test 300a.",

Feature 404b is formed into first surface 302b and extends part way through the substrate's thickness t. Feature 404b has a depth d1 between first surface 302b and a bottom surface 500. Feature 404b can be defined, at least in part, by a region or portion of substrate material 501 extending between feature 404b and second surface 303b. In this embodiment region 501 has a thickness e1.",
        "In this particular embodiment substrate 300b comprises silicon, while barrier layer 316b comprises a polymer such as Kapton. Other materials are described above in relation to FIG. 3. Reflectometer 422b terminates at fiber tip 436b positioned proximate second surface 303b and below feature 404b. Lens 438b is interposed between the fiber tip and the print head.",
        "FIG. 5a shows an enlarged view of fiber tip 436b and a portion of print head 204b, while FIG. 5b illustrates a graphical representation of fringe burst data generated at least in part from light reflected back from the print head. Light is emitted from fiber tip 436b and is indicated generally by arrows 1. Lens 438b can focus the light on the print head in a desired spot size s. In this particular embodiment the spot size is about 80 microns. Smaller and larger spot sizes s can be utilized in various embodiments.",
        "In this embodiment light l is selected to have a wavelength to which barrier layer 316b and substrate 300b are transparent. Some embodiments can utilize light having a center wavelength above about 1000 nanometers (nm) for these particular barrier layer and substrate materials. This particular embodiment utilizes light having a wavelength of about 1310 nm with a full-width at half maximum bandwidth of about 60 nm.",
        "As light l travels away from fiber tip 436b portions of light or photons are reflected back into the fiber tip 436b. The reflected light travels from the fiber tip back into the reflectometer base unit as described in relation to FIG. 4. The reflected light can be converted to data for determining substrate dimensions.",
        "Among other conditions, relatively large amounts of light l are reflected when the light encounters an interface of two materials having different indices of refraction. For example air has an index of refraction of about 1.0 while the polymer barrier layer 316b has a higher index of refraction. A relatively large amount of light reflects at the air to barrier interface indicated generally at 502 and represented generally by peak 503. Similarly, the barrier layer has a different index of refraction than silicon which is about 3.5. As such, a relatively large amount of light l reflects from this interface indicated generally at 504 and represented generally by peak 505. Further, light l encounters another interface 506 at bottom surface 500 of feature 404b that is represented generally by peak 507.",
        "The data depicted in FIG. 5b can be utilized to determine a physical or metric dimension of a print head material. For example the measured differential optical path length of a medium can be divided by the group index of light in the medium at the known source center wavelength such as 1310 nm and multiplied by the group index in air at the known source center wavelength such as 1310 nm to determine the metric thickness of the medium. A thickness of substrate material e1 can be determined utilizing the group index of the light in the silicon, the group index of light in air, and the reflectometer data indicating differential optical path length between peak 505 and peak 507. A thickness of the barrier layer can be similarly determined.",
        "FIGS. 6a-6g show process steps for processing a microdevice where the removal process can be controlled via data from the reflectometer. For purposes of explanation only the reflectometer's fiber tip 436c is shown as illustrated in FIGS. 6a-6g. Other components of an exemplary reflectometer are described in relation to FIG. 4. FIGS. 6a, 6c, 6e and 6g show process steps during the substrate removal process. FIGS. 6b, 6d, and 6f show graphical representations of data generated by the reflectometer at the processing steps illustrated in 6a, 6c, and 6e respectively.",
        "The reader now is referred to FIGS. 6a-6b. FIG. 6a shows a substrate 300c having a first layer comprising a polymer barrier layer 316c and a second layer comprising a polymer orifice layer 318c formed over second surface 303c. Light l emitted from fiber tip 436c can reflect back from print head 204c. Relatively high rates of reflection occur when the light contacts orifice layer 318c, barrier layer 316c, second surface 303c and first surface 302c. Theses surfaces are indicated by interfaces 602, 604, 606, and 608 respectively. The reflected light is converted to graphical data represented by FIG. 6b with peaks 612, 614, 616, and 618 relating to 602, 604, 606, and 608 respectively. Substrate thickness t can be determined based upon the graphical data of FIG. 6b and as described below in relation to FIGS. 5-5b. Similarly, barrier layer 316c and orifice layer 318c thicknesses also can be determined.",
        "The reader now is referred to FIGS. 6c-6d. FIG. 6c illustrates print head 204c after feature 404c is formed in substrate 300c. In this particular embodiment laser beam 408c removes substrate material to form the feature. Alternatively or additionally other substrate removal techniques can be utilized. Interfaces 602a, 604a, 606a, and 608a correspond to peaks 612a, 614a, 616a and 618a shown in FIG. 6d. Peaks 612a, 614a, 616a remain in essentially the same relative locations along the time axis as peaks 612, 614, and 616 illustrated in FIG. 6b. In contrast, peak 618a is shifted left toward peak 616a relative to peak 616 of FIG. 6b. While the distance between peaks 616 and 618 represented a substrate thickness t between second surface 303c and first surface 302c, the distance between peaks 616a and 618a represent thickness e1 of region 501a. This data can provide additional information. For example if the data of FIG. 6b indicates that substrate thickness t equals 675 microns and FIG. 6d indicates thickness e1 is 185 microns then 490 microns of material was removed to form feature 404c. If laser beam 408c made 30 passes over substrate 300c then laser beam 408c is removing an average of 16.33 microns of substrate material per pass. Such information can be utilized to control a processing system such as processing system 402a described in relation to FIG. 4.",
        "FIGS. 6e-6f illustrate a subsequent process step where additional substrate material is removed. Peaks 616b, 618b corresponding to interfaces 606b, 608b respectively, indicate that region 501c has a thickness e2 of 30 microns. A controller as described in relation to FIG. 4 can utilize the graphical data of FIGS. 6b, 6d, and 6f to control laser functioning. For example in one embodiment where design parameters indicate that the laser machining process should leave a substrate thickness e of 20-33 microns defining feature 404c the data regarding thickness e and substrate removal per laser pass can be utilized to determine a number of additional laser passes.",
        "Other embodiments may utilize the reflectometer data to control the removal process. For example, when the reflectometer data indicates that thickness e reaches a predetermined value such as 30 microns, the controller can cause the laser source to generate laser beam 408c at a lower power that removes less substrate material per pass so that a more precise thickness parameter can be achieved. Maintaining more precise parameters can contribute to print head quality and uniformity. For example some print head fabrication processes may want to remove as much substrate material with laser beam 408c as possible without breaking through the substrate's second surface 303c. If the laser beam breaks through the substrate it may damage the underlying layers. A second removal process may be utilized to remove additional substrate material and/or to finish the feature to form a through feature or slot. One such example can be seen in FIG. 6g where feature 404c comprises a slot through substrate 300c and barrier layer 316c. The slot can supply fluid to firing chambers (not shown) formed in the barrier layer. The fluid ultimately can be ejected from nozzles positioned over the firing chambers as described in relation to FIG. 3.",
        "FIG. 6g shows print head 204b where a second substrate removal process removes additional substrate material and portions of the barrier layer. In this particular embodiment the second substrate removal process comprises wet etching, though other embodiments can utilize other removal techniques. The wet etching process can produce higher quality and more uniform print heads when utilized on print heads having a uniform and known substrate thickness e between feature 404c and second surface 303c. The described embodiments can attain higher uniformity and attain closer tolerance parameters utilizing the data generated by the reflectometer.",
        "The above embodiments are described in the context of providing data regarding dimensions of microdevice components. Some embodiments can alternatively or additionally be utilized to determine relative locations of structures of a microdevice. FIGS. 7a-7f illustrate one such example.",
        "FIG. 7a illustrates a print head substrate 300d having thin films 314d and barrier layer 316d formed over second surface 303d. Thin films 314d were patterned to provide an area 702 through which a slot can be formed. In this instance thin-films 314d comprise at least some material, such as various metals among others, which is substantially opaque to light emitted from the reflectometer.",
        "Reflectometer's fiber tip 436d can be positioned relative to print head 204d by fixture 440d. To determine the location of area 702 fixture 440d can position fiber tip 436d at one extreme of the print head. For example to determine the location of area 702 in the y-direction, fiber tip 436d can be positioned at the extreme left or right side of the print head. As illustrated in FIG. 7a fiber tip 436d is positioned at the extreme left side.",
        "When light is reflected from interface 704 at the first surface of barrier layer 316d a peak 705 is generated. When light is reflected from interface 706 at thin-films 314d a second peak 707 is generated. Since essentially no light passes through thin film 314d no subsequent peaks occur.",
        "FIGS. 7c-7d illustrate print head 204d where fixture 440d moved fiber tip 436d to the right, but still below thin film material 314d. Peaks 705a, 707a indicated in FIG. 7d essentially match those of FIG. 7b.",
        "FIG. 7e-7f illustrate print head 204d where fixture 440d moved fiber tip 436d further to the right. Light from the fiber tip will now reflect from interfaces 704b, 706b and 712. These interfaces are represented by peaks 705b, 707b and 713 respectively. Similarly, more data can be generated by moving the fiber tip progressively to the right. An edge of the print head can be determined by scanning and moving until the data indicates no reflection associated with the print head. The data indicating the location of the area can be utilized by a controller to guide or otherwise to effect substrate removal to ensure proper alignment of a feature relative to the area. A similar technique can be employed in the x-direction to determine the relative x-dimensional location of area 702. A grid pattern also can be mapped out by making multiple passes in the x and y directions with the reflectometer. Such an example is discussed below in relation to FIGS. 8-8a.",
        "FIGS. 8-8a illustrate a further embodiment which combines embodiments described above to produce data which can map thickness e3 of multiple subunits of region 501e of a microdevice 804. In this embodiment region 501e can be defined between bottom surface 500e and second surface 303e of substrate 300e. In this particular embodiment the subunits comprise 60 subunits 802e1-802e60 though for purposes of clarity they are not all specifically labeled. Other embodiments may map the thickness into more or less subunits than the 60 subunits comprising this embodiment.",
        "Reflectometer's fiber tip 436e can be moved over second surface 303e along the x-axis, y-axis and/or combination thereof for positioning proximate the various subunits. An example of moving the fiber tip relative to the substrate and along the y-axis is provided above in relation to FIGS. 7a-7g. The fiber tip can then be repositioned in the x-direction and the process described above repeated. Other mapping methods should be recognized by the skilled artisan. The data generated by this movement or mapping can be utilized by a controller to effect further processing of individual sub-units 802e. For example, if an individual sub-unit 802e1 has a thickness greater than a predetermined tolerance value then further processing can be conducted on that sub-unit such as with a laser beam. Sub-units 802e2 and 802e3 which fall within the tolerance value would not receive additional substrate removal.",
        "Some embodiments could remap region 501e until all subunits 802e fell within the predetermined tolerance value. The skilled artisan should recognize other embodiments. The embodiment described relative to FIGS. 8-8a could also be utilized to map one or more surfaces of a wafer for deviations from a desired planarity. Any deviation could be utilized by a controller to adjust various processing techniques.",
