        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "This invention relates to an antenna, more particularly to a multifrequency inverted-F antenna for a portable electronic device.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Wireless communication devices, such as cellular phones, notebook computers, electronic appliances, and the like, are normally installed with an antenna that serves as a medium for transmission and reception of electromagnetic signals. The antenna can be built outside or inside the devices. However, the latter (built-in type) are more attractive due to the tendency of folding and breaking associated with the former upon use.",
        "FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional multifrequency Planar Inverted-F Antenna (PIFA) which includes a rectangular conductive radiating element 11 having opposite left and right ends, a rectangular conductive grounding element 12 that is vertically spaced apart from and that is electrically connected to the left end of the radiating element 11 through a conductive grounding leg 13, and a conductive signal feeding element 14 that is electrically connected to one side of the radiating element 11 at a feeding point between the left and right ends of the radiating element 11, that extends through an opening in the grounding element 12, and that is adapted to be electrically connected to a radio frequency transceiver (not shown). The length (L1) measured from the left end of the radiating element 11 to the feeding point is different from the length (L2) measured from the feeding point to the right end of the radiating element 11 so that two different frequency bands corresponding respectively to L1 and L2 (each length is about \u03bb/4, wherein \u03bb is the corresponding wavelength) can be emitted by the radiating element 11 when a signal is sent from the transceiver through the signal feeding element 14 to the radiating element 11.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates a conventional inverted-F antenna which is similar to the antenna shown in FIG. 1, except that the radiating element 11\u2032 is in the form of a wire. The antenna of this type can only resonate in a single frequency band.",
        "In view of the conventional inverted-F antennas, there is a need for a simpler structure and construction for the antennas that are capable of emitting and receiving multifrequency bands. Moreover, adjustment of the frequency bands through the input and output impedance is not possible for the conventional inverted-F antennas due to the fixed location of the signal feeding element 14 on the radiating element 11.",
        "Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a multifrequency inverted-F antenna that is capable of overcoming the aforementioned drawbacks of the prior art.",
        "According to this invention, there is provided a multifrequency inverted-F antenna that comprises: a conductive radiating element extending in a longitudinal direction and having opposite first and second ends lying in the longitudinal direction; a conductive grounding element spaced apart from the radiating element in a transverse direction relative to the longitudinal direction; a conductive interconnecting element extending between the radiating and grounding elements and including first, second, and third parts, the first part being electrically connected to the radiating element at a feeding point between the first and second ends of the radiating element, the second part being offset from the first part in the longitudinal direction and being electrically connected to the grounding element, the third part electrically interconnecting the first and second parts; and a feeding line electrically connected to the interconnecting element.",

        "For the sake of brevity, like elements are denoted by the same reference numerals throughout the disclosure.",
        "FIGS. 3 to 5 illustrate a first preferred embodiment of a multifrequency inverted-F antenna 2 of this invention. The antenna 2 includes: a conductive radiating element 3 in the form of a wire that extends in a longitudinal direction and that has opposite first and second ends 31, 32 lying in the longitudinal direction; a conductive grounding element 4 spaced apart from the radiating element 3 in a transverse direction relative to the longitudinal direction; a conductive interconnecting element 5 extending between the radiating and grounding elements 3, 4 and including first, second, and third parts 51, 52, 53, the first part 51 being electrically connected to the radiating element 3 at a feeding point (P) between the first and second ends 31, 32 of the radiating element 3, the second part 52 being offset from the first part 51 in the longitudinal direction and being electrically connected to the grounding element 4, the third part 53 electrically interconnecting the first and second parts 51, 52; and a feeding line 6 electrically connected to the interconnecting element 5.",
        "The first part 51 of the interconnecting element 5 has a radiating end 511 that is electrically connected to the radiating element 3 at the feeding point (P), and a distal end 512 that is opposite to the radiating end 511. The second part 52 of the interconnecting element 5 has a grounding end 521 that is electrically connected to the grounding element 4, and a distal end 522 that is opposite to the grounding end 521. The third part 53 of the interconnecting element 5 has opposite left and right ends 531, 532 electrically and respectively connected to the distal ends 512, 522 of the first and second parts 51, 52.",
        "The first and third parts 51, 53 form a first angle (\u03b81), and the second and third parts 51, 52 form a second angle (\u03b82). Each of the first and second angles (\u03b81, \u03b82) can be varied. In this preferred embodiment, each of the first and second angles (\u03b81, \u03b82) is equal to 90\u00b0.",
        "The grounding element 4 is in the form of a plate, and preferably extends in a direction parallel to the radiating element 3. The first and second parts 51, 52 preferably extend in a direction perpendicular to the radiating and grounding elements 3, 4.",
        "Preferably, the feeding line 6 is in the form of a coaxial cable line connected to a radio frequency transceiver (not shown), and includes a core conductor 61 that is electrically connected to the interconnecting element 5. The core conductor 61 of the feeding line 6 is preferably connected to the third part 53, and is more preferably connected to the left end 531 of the third part 53 of the interconnecting element 5 at one side face of the third part 53 that is opposite to the distal end 512 of the first part 51 of the interconnecting element 5. The feeding line 6 further includes a grounding layer 62 that is electrically connected to the grounding element 4.",
        "The feeding point (P) divides the radiating element 3 into left and right sections that have lengths (M1, M2) measured respectively from the left end 31 of the radiating element 3 to the feeding point (P) and from the feeding point (P) to the right end 32 of the radiating element 3. The left and right sections of the radiating element 3 correspond respectively to a high frequency band and a low frequency band. FIGS. 6 and 7 respectively illustrate signal paths that pass respectively through the first and second sections of the radiating element 3 when the radiating element 3 resonates at the corresponding frequency bands.",
        "During transmission of a signal from the transceiver to the radiating element 3, part of the signal may be transmitted to the grounding element 4. However, due to hindrance of the second angle (\u03b82), most of the signal will be transmitted to the radiating element 3 so as to permit emission of a radiation in the frequency bands. During reception of a signal, the signal passes through the respective section of the radiating element 3 and is first fed to the feeding line 6 through the first part 51 of the interconnecting element 5 prior to transmission to the grounding element 4 which is placed behind the feeding line 6. Although part of the signal may be fed to the grounding element 4, however, due to hindrance of the first and second angles (\u03b81, \u03b82), most of the signal will be fed to the feeding line 6 so as to be received by the transceiver.",
        "It is noted that it is not necessary to connect the core conductor 61 of the feeding line 6 to the left end 531 of the third part 53. The core conductor 61 can be connected to the third part 53 at a selected position between the left and right ends 531, 532 of the third part 53 so as to obtain a desired frequency band and impedance matching for the input and output impedance.",
        "FIG. 7 illustrates a second preferred embodiment of the multifrequency inverted-F antenna 2 which has a construction similar to the antenna 2 shown in FIG. 3, except that the radiating element 3 is in the form of a plate. The radiating element 3 is rectangular in shape and has a side edge 30. The radiating end 511 of the first part 51 is connected to the side edge 30. The side edge 30 of the radiating element 3 is formed with a groove 33 between the feeding point (P) and the second end 32 of the radiating element 3 so as to increase the length of the current path between the feeding point (P) and the second end 32 of the radiating element 3 and so as to minimize the dimension of the radiating element 3 in the longitudinal direction.",
        "FIG. 6 illustrates a portable electronic device, such as a notebook computer 7, with the antenna 2 of FIG. 3. The notebook computer 7 includes a main board module 70 and a display 71 that is connected to the main board module 70 and that has a display housing 710 and a display unit 711 mounted in the display housing 710. The antenna 2 is mounted in the display housing 710 with the grounding element 4 being electrically connected to a back plate of the display unit 711.",
        "Tables 1 and 2 are results of a test on the antenna 2 of FIG. 3 by measuring the Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) in a first frequency band ranging from 2.4 to 2.5 GHz (which is close to a frequency band 2.412 to 2.4835 GHz according to the specifications of wireless standards of IEEE802.11b) and in a second frequency band ranging from 5.15 to 5.825 GHz (which is close to a frequency band 5.15 to 5.85 GHz according to the specifications of wireless standards of IEEE802.11a). The VSWR value is an indication of the quality of the antenna, and is preferably less than 2 so as to prevent interference during transmission or reception of signals. Tables 1 and 2 show that the VSWR values for the tested frequency bands are less than 2, and that the antenna 2 is capable of providing multifrequency bands.",
