Policy statements are grouped together into tag groups, which are in turn grouped together to form metapolicies. A security administrator uses a security policy management application to create metapolicies for specific audiences. A lightweight directory access protocol module manages access to the security policy. The security policy management application also provides scoring, reporting, and project management functionalities.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "This invention relates generally to information security and more particularly to a system and method for implementing security management using a database-modeled security policy.",
        "2. Description of the Background Art",
        "Information security in the context of enterprise intranets and connections to internets focuses on three fundamental goals: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality relates to the need of insuring that information does not get into the wrong hands. Integrity relates to insuring that the information does not change states unless authorized. Availability relates to insuring that the wrong people do not get to the information but that the right people can. Traditionally, security policies have been entombed in paper manuscripts that are static documents conventionally relegated to the shelves of those responsible for observing the policies outlined therein. Further, changes to the security policy require the insertion and/or substitution of various pages of the policy. Insuring that maintenance of an up-to-date policy thus becomes an unwieldy task in an organization of any substantial size.",
        "Information security management in the context of today's networked systems is more than installing burglar alarms and monitoring doors. Information security administrators have to manage and coordinate the implementation of diverse tools and technologies tailored to assure the attainment of security information goals. The various tools must be deployed and their use coordinated to properly maximize their usefulness. A further requirement of modern security information systems is the need to provide meaningful metrics and reporting. In the dynamic environment in which the security information administrator must function, the need to audit and report on the use of software and hardware tools, new systems, new resources, discontinued resources, mergers, etc. is very difficult. A further consideration of the security information administrator is the management of resources. Resource allocation to maximize the usefulness of the various resources is critical. Additionally, resource allocation must be productive to justify the investment.",
        "The prior art takes a combination of various technologies, for example spreadsheet and database technologies and various utilities, and under management of the security information administrator, seeks to manage the different aspects of information security. None of the described technologies are specifically designed to manage the number of resources involved in modern information security. A further limitation of the paper policy is that dynamic searches are not enabled. For example, if it is desired to find the sections of the policy related to firewall administration, a search through the policy must be conducted manually. Additionally, as the management of the security policy is an ongoing process, data generated by the various resources used is not conveniently analyzable by the available resources.",
        "It is technically possible to break the security policy into sections; however, security policies are notorious for having numerous appendices that are constantly referenced throughout the policy. This makes the task of categorizing the various functions and roles assigned in the policy a very time-consuming and difficult task. This situation leads to the current practice of giving every user in the enterprise the entire policy whereas the entire policy should only be accessible by the information security administrator. A measure of access control is lost by this implementation in that every user has knowledge of every other user's roles and responsibilities.",
        "In the administration and management of a security policy, it is of utmost importance that the security information administrator be able to plan for, execute to maximize, and measure the effectiveness of the security policy. Prior art methods of accomplishing these goals fail to adequately meet these needs. A security information system must be able to assign roles to various users within the enterprise, schedule the performance of assigned tasks and dynamically assign users to new/additional roles/tasks. Furthermore, confirmation that the task was performed is required.",
        "In accordance with the present invention, a system and method are disclosed to implement a database-modeled security policy. One embodiment of the invention includes a security policy stored in a database, a security policy management application that resides in an application server, and a lightweight directory access protocol module for managing access to the security policy. The security policy includes policy statements with associated standards, guidelines, and procedures. Policy statements may be grouped into tag groups and each tag group includes subsections. Tag groups are organized into metapolicies. A policy statement can appear in more than one tag group and a tag group can appear in more than one metapolicy.",
        "A security administrator uses the security policy management application to manage the security policy. Other users, such as auditors, may access the security policy via a web server and a network. The security administrator can create metapolicies tailored for specific audiences.",
        "A comprehensive metapolicy includes each policy statement in the security policy. The comprehensive metapolicy may be organized into several domains and a domain score calculated for each domain. The domain scores are based on local scores for each metapolicy. Local scores are assessed at the standards level by assessors such as the security administrator or other auditors. Local scores and domain scores can be displayed in various ways to allow for flexible reporting on the security posture of the organization implementing the security policy.",
        "The security policy of the invention operates in conjunction with project management tools to support creation and management of security projects. The project management tools include project plans and status reports submitted electronically by project team members for viewing by the security administrator or other project manager.",

        "FIG. 1 is a block diagram of one embodiment of an electronic network system, in accordance with the present invention. The system of FIG. 1 includes, but is not limited to, a security administrator 110, a database 112, a lightweight directory access protocol module (LDAP) 114, an application server 116, a web server 118, a network 120, an auditor 132, a chief executive officer (CEO) 134, and a user 136. Database 112 includes a security policy for an organization such as a corporation. The security policy encompasses various domains within the corporation, such as network security and security of a physical premises. Security administrator 110 manages the security policy via application server 116 and LDAP 114. Web server 118 provides access via network 120 to application server 116. Network 120 may be implemented as any type of network, for instance a local area network or a wide area network such as the Internet. Auditor 132, CEO 134, and user 136 access network 120 and web server 118 using a web browser application (not shown).",

        "The security policy includes numerous policy statements that represent an organization's position on particular security topics. For example, one policy statement may be \u201cThe organization's computing systems shall have strong passwords.\u201d Each policy statement has associated with it standards, guidelines, and procedures, all of which provide detailed information about the policy statement. Standards clearly state security rules, such as \u201cAll user passwords shall be at least 8 characters in length,\u201d and \u201cAll user passwords shall be changed every 90 days.\u201d Guidelines are more general, for example \u201cUsers should avoid using passwords that can be easily guessed, such as the name of a spouse, child, or a birthdate.\u201d Procedures provide step-by-step instructions for carrying out a task associated with a policy statement.

A group 200 of tagged policy statements is shown. Each policy statement in group 200 has an associated tag or tags that organize the policy statements into tag groups. Group 200 is a subset of all the policy statements in the security policy. In one embodiment, group 200 includes all of the policy statements in the security policy, and in another embodiment group 200 includes fewer than all of the policy statements in the security policy.",
        "FIG. 2 shows four tag groups 210, 212, 214, and 216. A tag group may include a minimum of one policy statement, for example tag group 216, or a maximum of the total number of policy statements in group 200. The tag groups are organized into metapolicies, for example a metapolicy A 220 and a metapolicy B 222. Metapolicy A 220 includes tag group 210 and tag group 216. Metapolicy B 222 includes tag group 212, tag group 214, and tag group 216. A metapolicy contains a minimum of one tag group and a maximum of the total number of tag groups associated with group 200 of tagged policy statements. Tag groups are organized into subsections, where each subsection is associated with a particular policy statement.",
        "Security administrator 110 applies tags to the policy statements using the security policy management application. In an example, the policy statements relating to the security of a UNIX network are tagged with one tag, and the policy statements relating to the security of a Windows NT\u00ae network are tagged with another tag. Another tag group contains policy statements about general network security. Security administrator 110 may then create a metapolicy for users of the UNIX network using the appropriate tag groups and another metapolicy for users of the NT\u00ae network using the appropriate tag groups. In this example, both metapolicies will include the tag group containing policy statements about general network security.",
        "The tags and tag groups allow security administrator 110 to create metapolicies that are appropriate for specific audiences. Some audiences, for example temporary employees, should only have a very limited access to the security policy and security administrator 110 is able to create just such a metapolicy. Other audiences only need access to the portions of the security policy that concern them, for instance users of the UNIX network would find information regarding the security of the organization's accounting information unnecessary.",
        "Context is a collection of tokens that allows for multiple views of a single metapolicy. Different standards, guidelines, and procedures may be selected for presentation to different audiences using context as a filter for a metapolicy. Each subsection (collection of standards, guidelines, and procedures that support a policy statement) has an associated context mask that is a Boolean expression of tokens. A context manager at application server 116 adds and removes tokens from a current context as a user navigates a metapolicy.

Author information identifies the individual who drafted a particular item, which establishes authorship of wording in case clarification is needed. Author information may be associated with each part of the security policy (policy statements, standards, guidelines, procedures, subsections, and metapolicies).

Periodic enforcement actions are taken on a regular basis, for example a weekly review of a firewall log. On-demand enforcement actions are taken in response to a predefined condition or event (trigger), for example investigating the source of an intrusion attempt. Continuous enforcement actions are a permanent state of being, for example mandating that all employees will wear identification badges at all times.",

The project management tools include project definitions, team management, project plans and timelines, status reports, project prioritization, and collateral information. Project definitions include goals, constraints, requirements, and completion criteria. Team management includes contact information and role definition for team members. Team management may also include information about the skills of individuals to aid security administrator 110 in creating teams of individuals best suited for each project. Project plans and timelines define the goals of a project and deadlines or milestones for completion of the project.",
        "Status reports are submitted by team members, for example user 136, to application server 116 via web server 118 and network 120. Security administrator 110 may then review the status reports. Team members can mark items in the status reports as critical or add comments to a critical section, which triggers an immediate notification to the defined project manager and/or security officer. Project prioritization allows security administrator 110 to assign priorities to security projects and modify these priorities as needed.",
        "Security administrator 110 or other users 136 such as project managers or security officers create and manage security projects using the project management tools. Examples of security projects are anti-virus updates for a Windows NT\u00ae network, installing new security cameras in a building, and providing new employees with security badges. A security project may be a short-term project or an ongoing project that requires substantial management. For ongoing or long-term projects, the project management tools integrate with electronic mail and/or messaging services to automatically generate notices and reminders of key events, for example meeting reminders, project plan milestones, reminders for periodic tasks, policy review dates, notification when a status report contains a critical item, and notification when a local score (LP) falls below a predetermined level.",
        "Security administrator 110 can identify objectives that are appropriate for security projects from the local scores and domain scores. If scores are below the threshold for compliance in a certain area of security, security administrator 110 can create a project to address the deficiency. Security administrator 110 also uses the project management tools in conjunction with the contribution factors and weights of policy statements 310 to determine a priority for the project. Security administrator 110 uses the project management tools to identify team members with the skills needed for the project. As a security team typically has a fixed number of personnel, the invention allows security administrator 110 to allocate these limited resources in an efficient manner.",
        "The invention has been described above with reference to specific embodiments. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The foregoing description and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense."
