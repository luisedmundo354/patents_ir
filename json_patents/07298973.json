    "abstract": "A modular reconfigurable multi-server system for use in a wavelength-division-multiplexed based photonic burst switched (PBS) network with variable time slot provisioning. An optical high-speed I/O module within the multi-server system enables it to serve as an edge node in the PBS network. The optical I/O module statistically multiplexes the incoming packets (e.g., IP packets or Ethernet frames) received from a legacy network, generates control and data bursts, which are then scheduled for transmission over the PBS network. The optical I/O module then optically transmits and receives the scheduled optical bursts according to traffic priority and available network resources.",

        "An embodiment of the present invention relates to optical networks in general; and, more specifically, to high-speed networking of multiple servers in photonic burst switched networks.",
        "Transmission bandwidth demands in telecommunication networks (e.g., the Internet) appear to be ever increasing and solutions are being sought to support this bandwidth demand. One solution to this problem is to use fiber-optic networks, where wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) technology is used to support the ever-growing demand in optical networks for higher data rates.",
        "Conventional optical switched networks typically use wavelength routing techniques, which require that optical-electrical-optical (O-E-O) conversion of optical signals be done at the optical switches. O-E-O conversion at each switching node in the optical network is not only very slow operation (typically about ten milliseconds), but it is very costly, and potentially creates a traffic bottleneck for the optical switched network. In addition, the current optical switch technologies cannot efficiently support \u201cbursty\u201d traffic that is often experienced in packet communication applications (e.g., the Internet).",
        "A large communication network can be implemented using several sub-networks. For example, a large network to support Internet traffic can be divided into a large number of relatively small access networks operated by Internet service providers (ISPs), which are coupled to a number of metropolitan area networks (Optical MANs), which are in turn coupled to a large \u201cbackbone\u201d wide area network (WAN). The optical MANs and WANs typically require a higher bandwidth than local-area networks (LANs) in order to provide an adequate level of service demanded by their high-end users. However, as LAN speeds/bandwidth increase with improved technology, there is a need for increasing MAN/WAN speeds/bandwidth.",

The term photonic burst is used herein to refer to statistically-multiplexed packets (e.g., Internet protocol (IP) packets or Ethernet frames) having similar routing requirements). A photonic burst typically includes a photonic label including the header and other routing information of the IP packets and a payload including the data segments of the packets.",
        "This embodiment of PBS network 10 includes local area networks (LANs) 131-13N and a backbone optical WAN (not shown). In addition, this embodiment of PBS network 10 includes ingress nodes 151-15M, switching nodes 171-17L, and egress nodes 181-18K. PBS network 10 can include other ingress, egress and switching nodes (not shown) that are interconnected with the switching nodes shown in FIG. 1. The ingress and egress nodes are also referred to herein as edge nodes in that they logically reside at the edge of the PBS network. The edge nodes, in effect, provide an interface between the aforementioned \u201cexternal\u201d networks (i.e., external to the PBS network) and the switching nodes of the PBS network. In this embodiment, the ingress, egress and switching nodes are implemented with intelligent modules. This embodiment can be used, for example, as a metropolitan area network connecting a large number of LANs within the metropolitan area to a large optical backbone network.",
        "In some embodiments, the ingress nodes perform optical-electrical (O-E) conversion of received optical signals, and include electronic memory to buffer the received signals until they are sent to the appropriate LAN. In addition, in some embodiments, the ingress nodes also perform electrical-optical (E-O) conversion of the received electrical signals before they are transmitted to switching nodes 171-17M of PBS network 10.",
        "Egress nodes are implemented with optical switching units or modules that are configured to receive optical signals from other nodes of PBS network 10 and route them to the optical WAN or other external networks. Egress nodes can also receive optical signals from the optical WAN or other external network and send them to the appropriate node of PBS network 10. In one embodiment, egress node 181 performs O-E-O conversion of received optical signals, and includes electronic memory to buffer received signals until they are sent to the appropriate node of PBS network 10 (or to the optical WAN).",
        "Switching nodes 171-17L are implemented with optical switching units or modules that are each configured to receive optical signals from other switching nodes and appropriately route the received optical signals to other switching nodes of PBS network 10. As is described below, the switching nodes perform O-E-O conversion of optical control bursts and network management control burst signals. In some embodiments, these optical control bursts and network management control bursts are propagated only on preselected wavelengths. The preselected wavelengths do not propagate optical \u201cdata\u201d bursts (as opposed to control bursts and network management control bursts) signals in such embodiments, even though the control bursts and network management control bursts may include necessary information for a particular group of optical data burst signals. The control and data information is transmitted on separate wavelengths in some embodiments (also referred to herein as out-of-band signaling). In other embodiments, control and data information may be sent on the same wavelengths (also referred to herein as in-band signaling). In another embodiment, optical control bursts, network management control bursts, and optical data burst signals may be propagated on the same wavelength(s) using different encoding schemes such as different modulation formats, etc. In either approach, the optical control bursts and network management control bursts are sent asynchronously relative to its corresponding optical data burst signals. In still another embodiment, the optical control bursts and other control signals are propagated at different transmission rates as the optical data signals.",
        "Although switching nodes 171-17L may perform O-E-O conversion of the optical control signals, in this embodiment, the switching nodes do not perform O-E-O conversion of the optical data burst signals. Rather, switching nodes 171-17L perform purely optical switching of the optical data burst signals. Thus, the switching nodes can include electronic circuitry to store and process the incoming optical control bursts and network management control bursts that were converted to an electronic form and use this information to configure photonic burst switch settings, and to properly route the optical data burst signals corresponding to the optical control bursts. The new control bursts, which replace the previous control bursts based on the new routing information, are converted to an optical control signal, and it is transmitted to the next switching or egress nodes. Embodiments of the switching nodes are described further below.",
        "Elements of exemplary PBS network 10 are interconnected as follows. LANs 131-13N are connected to corresponding ones of ingress nodes 151-15M. Within PBS network 10, ingress nodes 151-15M and egress nodes 181-18K are connected to some of switching nodes 171-17L via optical fibers. Switching nodes 171-17L are also interconnected to each other via optical fibers in mesh architecture to form a relatively large number of lightpaths or optical links between the ingress nodes, and between ingress nodes 151-15L and egress nodes 181-18K. Ideally, there are more than one lightpath to connect the switching nodes 171-17L to each of the endpoints of PBS network 10 (i.e., the ingress nodes and egress nodes are endpoints within PBS network 10). Multiple lightpaths between switching nodes, ingress nodes, and egress nodes enable protection switching when one or more node fails, or can enable features such as primary and secondary route to destination.",
        "As described below in conjunction with FIG. 2, the ingress, egress and switching nodes of PBS network 10 are configured to send and/or receive optical control bursts, optical data burst, and other control signals that are wavelength multiplexed so as to propagate the optical control bursts and control labels on pre-selected wavelength(s) and optical data burst or payloads on different preselected wavelength(s). Still further, the edge nodes of PBS network 10 can send optical control burst signals while sending data out of PBS network 10 (either optical or electrical).",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates the operational flow of PBS network 10, according to one embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, photonic burst switched network 10 operates as follows.",
        "PBS network 10 receives packets from LANs 131-13N. In one embodiment, PBS network 10 receives IP packets at ingress nodes 151-15M. The received packets can be in electronic form rather than in optical form, or received in optical form and then converted to electronic form. In this embodiment, the ingress nodes store the received packets electronically. A block 20 represents this operation.",
        "For clarity, the rest of the description of the operational flow of PBS network 10 focuses on the transport of information from ingress node 151 to egress node 181. The transport of information from ingress nodes 152-15M to egress node 181 (or other egress nodes) is substantially similar.",
        "An optical burst label (i.e., an optical control burst) and optical payload (i.e., an optical data burst) is formed from the received packets. In one embodiment, ingress node 151 uses statistical multiplexing techniques to form the optical data burst from the received IP (Internet Protocol) packets stored in ingress node 151. For example, packets received by ingress node 151 and having to pass through egress node 181 on their paths to a destination can be assembled into an optical data burst payload. Statistical multiplexing generally refers to techniques for sharing a link or channel by multiple data sources based on statistics of the bandwidth used by the sources (e.g., an average) rather than the peak bandwidth required by each source. For example, statistical multiplexing techniques are disclosed by K. Kumaran and M. Mandjes, \u201cMultiplexing Regulated Traffic Streams: Design and Performance\u201d in Proc. of IEEE INFOCOM 2001; C.-F. Su and G. de Veciana, \u201cOn Statistical Multiplexing, Traffic Mixes, and VP Management\u201d in Proc. of IEEE INFOCOM 1998; B. Maglaris, D. Anastassiou, P. Sen, G. Karlsson, and J. D. Robbins, \u201cPerformance Models of Statistical Multiplexing in Packet Video Communications,\u201d IEEE Transaction on Communications 36, 834-844, 1988, T. Brown, \u201cAdaptive Statistical Multiplexing For Broadband Communication\u201d, Chapter 3, of \u201cPerformance Evaluation and Application of ATM Networks\u201d, Kouvatsos, D. editor, Kluwer, 2000. Other embodiments can use any suitable statistical multiplexing technique. A block 21 represents this operation.",
        "Bandwidth on a specific optical channel and/or fiber is reserved to transport the optical data burst through PBS network 10. In one embodiment, ingress node 151 reserves a time slot (i.e., a time slot of a TDM system) in an optical data signal path through PBS network 10. This time slot maybe fixed-time duration and/or variable-time duration with either uniform or non-uniform timing gaps between adjacent time slots. Further, in one embodiment, the bandwidth is reserved for a time period sufficient to transport the optical burst from the ingress node to the egress node. For example, in some embodiments, the ingress, egress, and switching nodes maintain an updated list of all used and available time slots. The time slots can be allocated and distributed over multiple wavelengths and optical fibers. Thus, a reserved time slot (also referred to herein as a TDM channel), that in different embodiments may be of fixed-duration or variable-duration, may be in one wavelength of one fiber, and/or can be spread across multiple wavelengths and multiple optical fibers. A block 22 represents this operation.",
        "When an ingress and/or egress node reserves bandwidth or when bandwidth is released after an optical data burst is transported, a network controller (not shown) updates the list. In one embodiment, the network controller and the ingress or egress nodes perform this updating process using various burst or packet scheduling algorithms based on the available network resources and traffic patterns. The available variable-duration TDM channels, which are periodically broadcasted to all the ingress, switching, and egress nodes, are transmitted on the same wavelength as the optical control bursts or on a different common preselected wavelength throughout the optical network. The network controller function can reside in one of the ingress or egress nodes, or can be distributed across two or more ingress and/or egress nodes. In this embodiment, the network controller is part of control unit 37 (FIG. 3), which can include one or more processors.",
        "The optical control bursts, network management control labels, and optical data bursts are then transported through photonic burst switched network 10 in the reserved time slot or TDM channel. In one embodiment, ingress node 151 transmits the control burst to the next node along the optical label-switched path (OLSP) determined by the network controller. In this embodiment, the network controller uses a constraint-based routing protocol [e.g., generalized multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS) Draft Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Architecture-05 Internet-Draft, March 2003] over one or more wavelengths to determine the best available OLSP to the egress node.",
        "In one embodiment, the control label (also referred to herein as a control burst) is transmitted asynchronously ahead of the photonic data burst and on a different wavelength and/or different fiber. The time offset between the control burst and the data burst allows each of the switching nodes to process the label and configure the photonic burst switches to appropriately switch before the arrival of the corresponding data burst. The term photonic burst switch is used herein to refer to fast optical switches that do not use O-E-O conversion.",
        "In one embodiment, ingress node 151 then asynchronously transmits the optical data bursts to the switching nodes where the optical data bursts experience little or no time delay and no O-E-O conversion within each of the switching nodes. The optical control burst is always sent before the corresponding optical data burst is transmitted.",
        "In some embodiments, the switching node may perform O-E-O conversion of the control bursts so that the node can extract and process the routing information included in the label. Further, in some embodiments, the TDM channel is propagated in the same wavelengths that are used for propagating labels. Alternatively, the labels and payloads can be modulated on the same wavelength in the same optical fiber using different modulation formats. For example, optical labels can be transmitted using non-return-to-zero (NRZ) modulation format, while optical payloads are transmitted using return-to-zero (RZ) modulation format. The optical burst is transmitted from one switching node to another switching node in a similar manner until the optical control and data bursts are terminated at egress node 181. A block 23 represents this operation.",
        "The operational flow at this point depends on whether the target network is an optical WAN or a LAN. A block 24 represents this branch in the operational flow.",
        "If the target network is an optical WAN, new optical label and payload signals are formed. In this embodiment, egress node 181 prepares the new optical label and payload signals. A block 25 represents this operation.",
        "The new optical label and payload are then transmitted to the target network (i.e., WAN in this case). In this embodiment, egress node 181 includes an optical interface to transmit the optical label and payload to the optical WAN. A block 26 represents this operation.",
        "However, if in block 24 the target network is a LAN, the optical data burst is disassembled to extract the IP packets or Ethernet frames. In this embodiment, egress node 181 converts the optical data burst to electronic signals that egress node 181 can process to recover the data segment of each of the packets, as represented in block 25 represents this operation.",
        "The extracted IP data packets or Ethernet frames are processed, combined with the corresponding IP labels, and then routed to the target network (i.e., LAN in this case). In this embodiment, egress node 181 forms these new IP packets. A block 28 represents this operation. The new IP packets are then transmitted to the target network (i.e., LAN) as represented in block 26.",
        "PBS network 10 can achieve increased bandwidth efficiency through the additional flexibility afforded by the TDM channels. Although this exemplary embodiment described above includes an optical MAN having ingress, switching and egress nodes to couple multiple LANs to an optical WAN backbone, in other embodiments the networks do not have to be LANs, optical MANs or WAN backbones. That is, PBS network 10 may include a number of relatively small networks that are coupled to a relatively larger network that in turn is coupled to a backbone network.",
        "Although a WDM embodiment is described above, in other embodiments, a single wavelength can be used for the entire PBS network. Some of these single wavelength alternative embodiments have multiple optical fibers interconnections between each node to provide increased bandwidth.",
        "FIG. 3 illustrates a module 17 for use as a switching node in photonic burst switched network 10 (FIG. 1), according to one embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, module 17 includes a set of optical wavelength division demultiplexers 301-30A, where A represents the number of input optical fibers used for propagating payloads, labels, and other network resources to the module. For example, in this embodiment, each input fiber could carry a set of C wavelengths (i.e., WDM wavelengths), although in other embodiments the input optical fibers may carry differing numbers of wavelengths. Module 17 would also include a set of N\u00d7N photonic burst switches 321-32B, where N is the number of input/output ports of each photonic burst switch. Thus, in this embodiment, the maximum number of wavelengths at each photonic burst switch is A\u00b7C, where N\u2267A\u00b7C+1. For embodiments in which N is greater than A\u00b7C, the extra input/output ports can be used to loop back an optical signal for buffering.",
        "Further, although photonic burst switches 321-32B are shown as separate units, they can be implemented as N\u00d7N photonic burst switches using any suitable switch architecture. Module 17 also includes a set of optical wavelength division multiplexers 341-34A, a set of optical-to-electrical signal converters 36 (e.g., photo-detectors), a control unit 37, and a set of electrical-to-optical signal converters 38 (e.g., lasers). Control unit 37 may have one or more processors to execute software or firmware programs.",
        "The elements of this embodiment of module 17 are interconnected as follows. Optical demultiplexers 301-30A are connected to a set of A input optical fibers that propagate input optical signals from other switching nodes of photonic burst switched network 10 (FIG. 10). The output leads of the optical demultiplexers are connected to the set of B core optical switches 321-32B and to optical signal converter 36. For example, optical demultiplexer 301 has B output leads connected to input leads of the photonic burst switches 321-32B (i.e., one output lead of optical demultiplexer 301 to one input lead of each photonic burst switch) and at least one output lead connected to optical signal converter 36.",
        "The output leads of photonic burst switches 321-32B are connected to optical multiplexers 341-34A. For example, photonic burst switch 321 has A output leads connected to input leads of optical multiplexers 341-34A (i.e., one output lead of photonic burst switch 321 to one input lead of each optical multiplexer). Each optical multiplexer also an input lead connected to an output lead of electrical-to-optical signal converter 38. Control unit 37 has an input lead or port connected to the output lead or port of optical-to-electrical signal converter 36. The output leads of control unit 37 are connected to the control leads of photonic burst switches 321-32B and electrical-to-optical signal converter 38. As described below in conjunction with the flow diagram of FIG. 5, module 17 is used to receive and transmit optical control bursts, optical data bursts, and network management control bursts. In one embodiment, the optical data bursts and optical control bursts have transmission formats as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B.",
        "FIG. 4A illustrates the format of an optical data burst for use in PBS network 10 (FIG. 1), according to one embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, each optical data burst has a start guard band 40, an IP payload data segment 41, an IP header segment 42, a payload sync segment 43 (typically a small number of bits), and an end guard band 44 as shown in FIG. 4A. In some embodiments, IP payload data segment 41 includes the statistically-multiplexed IP data packets or Ethernet frames used to form the burst. Although FIG. 4A shows the payload as contiguous, module 17 transmits payloads in a TDM format. Further, in some embodiments the data burst can be segmented over multiple TDM channels. It should be pointed out that in this embodiment the optical data bursts and optical control bursts have local significance only in PBS network 10, and may loose their significance at the optical WAN.",
        "FIG. 4B illustrates the format of an optical control burst for use in photonic burst switched network 10 (FIG. 1), according to one embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, each optical control burst has a start guard band 46, an IP label data segment 47, a label sync segment 48 (typically a small number of bits), and an end guard band 49 as shown in FIG. 4B.

        "FIG. 5 illustrates the operational flow of module 17 (FIG. 3), according to one embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIGS. 3 and 5, module 17 operates as follows.",
        "Module 17 receives an optical signal with TDM label and data signals. In this embodiment, module 17 receives an optical control signal (e.g., an optical control burst) and an optical data signal (i.e., an optical data burst in this embodiment) at one or two of the optical demultiplexers. For example, the optical control signal may be modulated on a first wavelength of an optical signal received by optical demultiplexer 30A, while the optical data signal is modulated on a second wavelength of the optical signal received by optical demultiplexer 30A. In some embodiments, the optical control signal may be received by a first optical demultiplexer while the optical data signal is received by a second optical demultiplexer. Further, in some cases, only an optical control signal (e.g., a network management control burst) is received. A block 51 represents this operation.",
        "Module 17 converts the optical control signal into an electrical signal. In this embodiment, the optical control signal is the optical control burst signal, which is separated from the received optical data signal by the optical demultiplexer and sent to optical-to-electrical signal converter 36. In other embodiments, the optical control signal can be a network management control burst (previously described in conjunction with FIG. 4B). Optical-to-electrical signal converter 36 converts the optical control signal into an electrical signal. For example, in one embodiment each portion of the TDM control signal is converted to an electrical signal. The electrical control signals received by control unit 37 are processed to form a new control signal. In this embodiment, control unit 37 stores and processes the information included in the control signals. A block 53 represents this operation.",
        "Module 17 then routes the optical data signals (i.e., optical data burst in this embodiment) to one of optical multiplexers 341-34A, based on routing information included in the control signal. In this embodiment, control unit 37 processes the control burst to extract the routing and timing information and sends appropriate PBS configuration signals to the set of B photonic burst switches 321-32B to re-configure each of the photonic burst switches to switch the corresponding optical data bursts. A block 55 represents this operation.",
        "Module 17 then converts the processed electrical control signal to a new optical control burst. In this embodiment, control unit 37 provides TDM channel alignment so that reconverted or new optical control bursts are generated in the desired wavelength and TDM time slot pattern. The new control burst may be modulated on a wavelength and/or time slot different from the wavelength and/or time slot of the control burst received in block 51. A block 57 represents this operation.",
        "Module 17 then sends the optical control burst to the next switching node in the route. In this embodiment, electrical-to-optical signal generator 38 sends the new optical control burst to appropriate optical multiplexer of optical multiplexers 341-34A to achieve the route. A block 59 represents this operation.",
        "FIG. 6 illustrates a PBS network 60 with server edge nodes, according to one embodiment of the present invention. In this example, PBS network 60 is similar to PBS network 10 (FIG. 1) except that one or more ingress and egress nodes are replaced with edge nodes 611-61Y. Edge nodes 611-61Y include configuration units 631-63Y, respectively. The term \u201cconfiguration unit\u201d, as used herein, refers to a unit that provides services to clients via PBS network 60 such as, for example, servers (e.g., file or application), or storage. Storage services can include, for example, direct attached storage (DAS), network attached storage (NAS), or storage device(s) if PBS network 60 is implementing a PBS-based storage area network (SAN). Examples of configuration units are described below in conjunction with FIGS. 6A-6C.",
        "In this embodiment, networks 131-13N are connected to edge nodes 611-61Y via label edge routers (LERS) 621-62X. In some embodiments networks 131-13N are LAN, WAN, SANs, and/or other PBS networks. In some embodiments, the network can be connected directly to an edge node without a LER. The nodes (i.e., ingress, egress, edge, and switching nodes) of PBS network 60 are interconnected as previously described in conjunction with PBS network 10 (FIG. 1).",
        "For clarity, the operation of PBS network 60 is described below using an example in which configuration units 621-62X are multi-server units. In typical applications, the multi-server units can support high bandwidth and/or delay sensitive applications such as, for example, file server, mail server, media server, application server, web server, etc. applications. The operation is similar when configuration units are used for storage applications.",
        "The operation of PBS network 60 is significantly different from conventional networks having conventional servers such as server farms or blade servers. In conventional networks, the servers are simply other devices connected to the network, competing for network resources such as bandwidth. In some applications, servers communicate with each other over a network. However, the servers provide little or no network provisioning and traffic engineering functionality. Thus, most traffic on the network is transmitted on a best effort basis, representing a bottleneck in the transfer of information between server farms.",
        "In contrast, this embodiment of PBS network 60 avoids this bottleneck by modifying conventional server farms (or other multi-server or storage units) to serve as edge nodes 611-61Y in a PBS network. These modified multi-server units (i.e., configuration units 631-63Y) have an optical PBS interface (e.g., see FIG. 6A) and aggregate information into optical PBS control and data bursts to be sent over the PBS network. As previously described, the PBS network provides high speed networking, especially in applications in which the information transfers are \u201cbursty\u201d as in some packet-type communication protocols (e.g., IP and Ethernet). One embodiment of a multi-server unit is described below in conjunction with FIG. 7.",

One embodiment is described in more detail below in conjunction with FIG. 7.",
        "In some embodiments, the servers of configuration unit 63A (and/or other multi-server configuration units in the PBS network) can be organized into one ore more server clusters. Each server cluster is seen as a single server by other clients connected to the PBS network. Such embodiments can provide load balancing (which can improve performance) and fault recovery capability to recover from, for example, server or other hardware failures, server software failures, or connection failures. In addition, clustering can be used in these embodiments to selectively connect or disconnect a server (or servers) from the cluster, which effectively disconnects it from the PBS network.",
        "To form a cluster, each server in the cluster includes clustering software to detect faults, perform failover operations, and perform load balancing operations. The clustering software can also include components to support selective connect/disconnect of servers from the cluster, which will effectively add/remove them from the PBS Network. Suitable clustering software is commercially available for several operating systems used in servers. For hardware, the servers in the cluster are interconnected via a network (typically separate from the network used by clients) used for communication/polling between the servers of the cluster. The hardware can also include redundant storage devices that are shared by the servers in the cluster either through direct connection or via one or more hubs.",

Storage unit 67 can be implemented with one or more hard drives, tape drives, etc., and typically communicates with server 66 via various types of interfaces such as a small computer system interface (SCSI) (e.g. SCSI Architecture Model-3, working draft of T10, Technical Committee of Accredited Standards Committee INCITS, Mar. 19, 2003), Internet SCSI (iSCSI) interface (e.g., iSCSI draft #20, IP storage working group, Internet Engineering task force (IETF) Jan. 19, 2003), fiber channel (FC) interface (e.g., FC Protocol for SCSI (FCP-3) revision 0, Dec. 12, 2002), etc. In operation, information stored by storage unit 67 is available to other units connected to the PBS network via server 66.",

In this embodiment, configuration unit 63C is implemented with a storage unit with PBS interface 65 (i.e., no server is present). Configuration unit 63C can be used as a NAS unit in PBS network 60. For example, PBS network 60 can include one edge node having configuration unit 63C, with the rest of the edge nodes having configuration units like configuration unit 63A. This configuration allows all of the other edge nodes to access the storage unit directly via lightpaths in PBS network 60. However, in this NAS application, storage traffic is added to all of the other PBS traffic, which might decrease the performance of the PBS network.",
        "In another configuration, configuration unit 63C can be used to implement all of configuration units 631-63Y in PBS network 60 so that PBS network 60 functions like a SAN. In this configuration, PBS network 60 provides a network that is dedicated to storage traffic. Other networks (e.g., networks 131-13N in FIG. 6) can then access the storage available in PBS network 60 via an edge node's egress capability.",

Optical I/O module 71, legacy interface module 73 and server modules 751-754 are connected to backplane 77 (and the aforementioned electrical switching fabric 830) via connectors 781-786. Optical port 72 is connected to a PBS network (e.g., PBS network 60 in FIG. 6). Legacy port 74 is connected to a legacy network or LER (e.g., see FIG. 6). Chassis 79 houses and physically supports the modules, connectors and backplane. Chassis 79 also includes other units (e.g., power supplies, cooling fan or fans, etc.) that are not shown in FIG. 7 to avoid obscuring the invention.",
        "In operation, unit 70 can operate as a conventional multi-server unit providing services to clients coupled to the legacy network. For example, in one embodiment, data traffic between the client and a server module (i.e., one of server modules 751-754) can be carried via legacy interface module 73, backplane 77 and the appropriate server of server modules 751-754, as in a conventional multi-server unit.",
        "In addition, a server module (i.e., one of server modules 751-754) may provide services to a client via the PBS network and optical I/O module 71. However, unlike in a conventional multi-server unit, optical I/O module 71 receives optical PBS burst(s) from the client, which are then O-E converted, de-framed, and processed as previously described for an ingress node of PBS network 10 (FIG. 1). Optical I/O module 71 provides all the necessary information to route the incoming traffic to the appropriate server module (i.e., one of server modules 751-754) via backplane 77 in the same manner as a server module would transfer information over backplane 77.",

        "Traffic coming into unit 70 from a legacy network for transfer to a destination via the PBS network is received by unit 70 at legacy port 74. As previously stated, the legacy network can use a conventional networking protocol such as, for example, TCP/IP or Ethernet protocols. In this embodiment, the legacy network is an electrical GbE network, although other wired or wireless networks can be used in other embodiments. Legacy interface module 73 transmits the information received at legacy port 74 to optical I/O module 71 via backplane 77 in the same manner as any server module transfers information over backplane 77. Optical I/O module 71 forms the information from legacy interface module 73 into PBS burst(s) in substantially the same manner as previously described for an ingress node of a PBS network 10 (FIG. 1).

In this embodiment, framer unit 808 receives the bursts from queue unit 806 via interconnect 844 and performs the framing operation. In one embodiment, the bursts are framed as described in aforementioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/377,580. In other embodiments, different framing formats can be used. This operational flow is represented by a block 1008.",
        "The framed bursts are then converted to optical signals and transmitted over the PBS network at the scheduled times. In this embodiment, E-O interface 810 receives the framed bursts (i.e., PBS control and data bursts) from framer unit 808 via interconnect 846. E-O interface 810 then performs the E-O conversion and transmits the optical signals at the scheduled time and in the reserved PBS TDM channel of the PBS network. This operational flow is represented by blocks 1010 and 1012.",
