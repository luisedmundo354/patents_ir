        "The present invention relates to a method of producing metal particles; in particular, a method of producing metal fine-particles having nanometer particle sizes. Further, the present invention relates to a method of producing a dispersion containing the fine particles.",
        "Further, the present invention relates to a method of producing metal hydroxide particles; in particular, a method of producing metal hydroxide fine-particles having nanometer particle sizes. Further, the present invention relates to a method of producing a dispersion containing the fine particles. Further, the present invention relates to a metal oxide obtained by oxidizing the metal, e.g. in the form of metal hydroxide.",
        "Metal particles can be synthesized, for example, by a gas phase method, in which metal vapor evaporated at high temperature is supplied into a gas phase to cool the vapor rapidly by collision with gas molecules, thereby forming fine particles; a solution method, which may be referred to as a liquid phase method hereinafter, in which a reducing agent is added to a solution in which metal ions are dissolved to reduce the metal ions, or some other method.",
        "Metal hydroxide fine particles can be synthesized, for example, by the above gas phase method; or a liquid phase method, such as a solution method of controlling pH or anions of an aqueous solution in which metal ions are dissolved, to take out a metal hydroxide, and subsequently drying or firing the hydroxide, as well as a sol-gel method, a reversed micelle method, or a hot soap method.",
        "Among these methods, the liquid phase method has an advantage that the particles can be relatively inexpensively synthesized in great volume. The liquid phase method is usually performed by adding a metal cation solution, and a reducing agent solution or a solution that contains hydroxide ions, to a reaction vessel having a stirrer. By initial addition thereof, nuclei are formed, and by subsequent addition, crystal growth is caused. For example, various methods used to form silver halide grains are known (see, for example, JP-A-7-219092 (\u201cJP-A\u201d means unexamined published Japanese patent application), JP-A-8-171156, JP-A-4-283741, JP-B-8-22739 (\u201cJP-B\u201d means examined Japanese patent publication), and U.S. Pat. No. 3,782,954). However, when any of these methods is used in nuclei formation, any stirring that can be used makes the liquid circulate in the reaction vessel, and therefore the nucleus formation is caused in parallel to nucleus growth, and as a result, it is difficult to form monodispersive nuclei.",
        "To perform mixing of the added liquid without mechanical stirring, methods wherein no circulation of the added liquid is performed are also disclosed (see, for example, JP-A-4-139440 and JP-T-6-507255 (\u201cJP-T\u201d means searched and published International patent application)). However, in these methods, the power of the mixing is insufficient, since intense stirring is not performed. Methods of mixing the two liquids in a pipe are also disclosed (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,104,786, and JP-A-11-38539). Although no circulation of the added liquid is generated in this case, the added liquid is so-called plug flow, which flows in a constant direction; therefore, it is unavoidable that the mixing relies on the generation of turbulence accompanying high flow velocity. Thus, to generate sufficient turbulence in the plug flow, it is necessary to maintain a very high velocity flow, and carrying out this involves difficulty.",
        "To keep sufficient mixing power without any mechanical stirring, there are known methods to make the added liquid into a linear jet flow, and perform the mixing by kinetic energy thereof. For example, a method of using kinetic energy of such a jet flow to produce a silver halide photographic emulsion is also disclosed (see, for example, JP-A-8-334848). However, the method disclosed in JP-A-8-334848 is a production method based on a single jet method; mechanical stirring is together used, since the used kinetic energy is insufficient to perform mixing in the entire reaction vessel.",
        "There are also known methods to make at least one of two-type aqueous solutions into a linear jet flow having a high flow velocity, and mix the two-type solutions in a short period of time, to produce silver halide grains continuously (see, for example, JP-A-2000-338620 and JP-A2001-290231). However, even if high flow velocity is used in these methods, the caused mixing is insufficient for mixing microscopically. Thus, further improvement has been desired.",
        "In the dispersion obtained by the reaction, a salt(s) or a decomposition product(s), which are by-products, are dissolved together with metal hydroxide fine particles. Thus, it is usually necessary to remove these by-products. To remove the salts or the decomposition products, for example, ultrafiltration, electrodialysis, or centrifugal separation is used. However, when the dispersion containing fine particles of nanometer size is treated, the former two methods cause the filtration membrane or the dialysis membrane to be easily clogged, and as such the methods are not practical. The latter method is inefficient, since batch treatment must be conducted.",

        "The flow of fluid is classified into largely different two flow patterns. One thereof is laminar flow, and it is flow, in which fluid particles in each portion flow systematically, without putting the front and rear of the particles along the flow direction into disorder, nor replacing the positions of the particles adjacent along the direction perpendicular to the flow direction mutually. The other is turbulence, and it is flow, in which fluid particles in each portion move irregularly in the front and rear direction and/or in the right and left direction. The time when flow is transited from laminar flow to turbulence is a time when the Reynolds' number thereof reaches a given value.",
        "In turbulence, any material is mixed due to two factors, that is, so-called flow, which will be referred to as \u201caverage flow\u201d hereinafter, and eddy that flows in a direction different from the average flow, which will be referred to \u201ceddy flow (vortex flow)\u201d hereinafter. In order to obtain a high stirring efficiency in microscopic regions, it is necessary to perform mixing on the basis of eddy flow. In the case that a conventional method as disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,104,786 mentioned at \u201cBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\u201d of the specification, is used to generate eddy flow, it cannot be said that sufficient mixing is attained even if an apparatus having a Reynolds' number of several tens of thousands is used. In this connection, the inventor has found that the flow velocity of flow is reduced in a short period of time, thereby the kinetic energy of the fluid can be converted from that in average flow to eddy flow, and that the efficiency for stirring and mixing the flow can be made remarkably high.",
        "In the case that the motion of fluid is based on turbulence, the apparent viscosity value thereof becomes very high. This apparent viscosity is \u201ceddy viscosity\u201d. A change from average flow to eddy flow can be evaluated as the eddy viscosity. Thus, in the present invention, plural solutions in which reaction should be caused are introduced into a site wherein large eddy viscosity is generated.",
        "In the case that eddy viscosity is generated in jetted flow, the amount of eddy flow generated when the velocity of the jet flow is reduced can be made larger, which is more profitable for mixing, as the velocity of the jetted flow is larger. On the other hand, in order to generate a larger jetted flow velocity in any conventional method, it is necessary to generate high pressure. Thus, problems such that a large burden is imposed on the production are caused. In the present invention, however, a high mixing efficiency can be obtained even if the velocity of flow jetted into a velocity-reducing region of the jetted flow, that is, a mixing chamber is relatively small. As a result, burden imposed on the production can be largely reduced.",
        "The size of the particles in the present invention, preferably the size of the metal particles produced by the production method of the first embodiment of the present invention, is not particularly limited.

        "In the present invention, the straightly-going flow is jetted out in the form of jet flow, and then introduced into the mixing chamber.",
        "In the present invention, the wording \u201cthe other solution is jetted out (into the mixing chamber) in the form of orthogonal flow which is substantially orthogonal to the straightly-going flow\u201d means that the orthogonal flow is allowed not to be completely orthogonal to the straightly-going flow and has, as the main component, a velocity vector component in the orthogonal direction to the straightly-going flow. The term \u201chaving, as the main component, a velocity vector component in the orthogonal direction to the straightly-going flow\u201d means that the component orthogonal (at 90\u00b0) to the Z direction, which is the direction of the straightly-going flow, is 70% or more of the average value of velocity vector of the orthogonal flow when jetted into the mixing chamber.",

        "The present invention does not use the following technique: as performed in conventional static mixers, high velocity turbulence of a solution which contains metal ions and high velocity turbulence of a solution which contains hydroxide ions are caused to collide with each other at an intersection point of a very thin pipe (tube), such as a T-shaped tube or a Y-shaped tube, so that the solutions are instantaneously mixed and caused to react with each other in the collision site. For example, paying attention to eddy viscosity known as a miscibility-evaluating factor in eddy flow sites, the first embodiment of the present invention is made to add straightly-going flow, e.g., in a thread line form, of a reducing agent solution (or a metal salt solution) and orthogonal flow of a metal salt solution. (or a reducing agent solution) to a mixing chamber inside a static mixing apparatus, and to use eddy viscosity generated by being carried by the straightly-going flow, thereby causing the two solutions to be mixed and react with each other instantaneously. In the second embodiment of the present invention, two solutions are instantaneously mixed and caused to react with each other in the same manner as in the first embodiment of the present invention, except for using, instead of the metal salt solution and the reducing agent solution, a solution which contains metal ions and a solution which contains hydroxide ions, respectively.",
        "That is, a static mixing apparatus that can be used in the present invention is a mixer, wherein a first nozzle and a second nozzle are provided to the mixer in which a cylindrical mixing clamber is formed, the diameters of each of the nozzles being smaller than the diameter (cylinder diameter) of the mixing chamber, thereby eddy viscosity can be generated by jetting out the solutions from the small-diameter nozzles to the larger-diameter mixing chamber; and further the diameter of a discharging port is narrowed to apply pressure to the mixing chamber, thereby a gas-liquid interface is not easily formed in the mixing chamber by cavitation.",
        "Further, the present inventor found the fact that when the eddy viscosity is generated by the straightly-going flow jetted out one solution of the metal salt solution and the reducing agent solution from the first nozzle in the first embodiment, or one of the metal ion-containing solution and the hydroxide ion-containing solution from the first nozzle in the second embodiment, the eddy viscosity becomes maximum at a position slightly apart in distance jetted from the first nozzle, and at this position of the maximum eddy viscosity the efficiency for mixing the two solutions becomes maximum. In the present invention, the positional relationship between the first nozzle and the second nozzle is defined in such a manner that the orthogonal flow, which is the other solution of the two solutions, is jetted into the mixing chamber at a position before the position where the eddy viscosity becomes maximum. The position where the eddy viscosity becomes maximum can be determined, by using a numerical analysis software which has already been commercially available as a fluidity analysis software in Japan (for example, R-Flow (trade name), manufactured by R-Flow Co.), to perform a simulation beforehand, and to grasp a region where eddy viscosity appears and the center point thereof. The position where the orthogonal flow from the second nozzle is to be added can be determined to be on the side nearer the jetting nozzle of the straightly-going flow from this central point.",
        "The position where the eddy viscosity becomes maximum in the mixing chamber corresponds substantially to a position where the maximum velocity of the straightly-going flow from the first nozzle is reduced to 1/10 thereof. Therefore, the second nozzle may be positioned in such a manner that the orthogonal flow is jetted out before the velocity of the straightly-going flow is reduced to 1/10  or less of the maximum velocity. As a result, the other solution is jetted out at a position before the position where the velocity of the straightly-going flow, as the one solution, is reduced to 1/10  or less, thereby the two solutions can be mixed.",
        "The wording \u201cthe other solution is jetted out at a position before the position where the velocity the straightly-going flow is reduced to 1/10  or less, thereby the two solutions are mixed\u201d, referred to in the present invention, means that in the direction along the maximum velocity of the straightly-going flow is exhibited when the straightly-going flow is jetted out (hereinafter, referred to \u201cZ direction\u201d in some cases), a jetting port for the other solution is located at a position within the range where the velocity Vz of the straightly-going flow is represented by the following formula (1), and the other solution is jetted out in the form of orthogonal flow orthogonal substantially to the straightly-going flow:\n\n( 1/10)Vz0<Vz<Vz0\u2003\u2003Formula (1)",

        "As described above, according to the present invention, since it is possible to realize a remarkably preferable mixing state in the static mixing apparatus, metal particles and metal hydroxide fine-particles, each of which have small particle sizes and are excellent in mono-dispersibility, can be formed.",
        "Referring to the attached drawings, the following will describe preferred embodiments of the method of producing metal particles or metal hydroxide fine-particles according to the present invention and an apparatus that can be used in the method.",
        "FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating one example of the structure of a static mixing apparatus 12 that can be used in the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 1, in the static mixing apparatus 12, to an opening at one end side of a mixer 22, in which a cylindrical mixing chamber 20 is formed in order to mix a solution X (hereinafter, \u201csolution X\u201d means a metal salt solution in the first embodiment, and a solution which contains metal ions in the second embodiment) and a solution Y (hereinafter, \u201csolution Y\u201d means a reducing agent solution in the first embodiment, and a solution which contains hydroxide ions in the second embodiment) to react with each other, is connected a first pipe 24 for introducing the solution Y into the mixing chamber 20, and further a discharge pipe 26 for discharging a mixed reaction solution 40 obtained by the mixing and reaction in the mixing chamber 20 is connected to an opening at the other side of the mixer 22. A second pipe 28 for introducing the solution X into the mixing chamber 20 is connected to the side face of the mixer 22 in the vicinity of the outlet of the first pipe 24. In the present embodiment, the solution Y is introduced from the first pipe 24 and the solution X is introduced from the second pipe 28, but the two solutions may be made reverse. The position where the discharge pipe 26 is connected may be at a portion in the side face of the mixer 22 if the portion is near the other end of the mixer 22.",
        "Inside the tips of the first pipe 24 and the second pipe 28, a first orifice 30 and a second orifice 32 are formed, respectively. In this way, a first nozzle 34 and a second nozzle 36, each of which is for jetting out turbulent liquid, are provided to the first pipe 24 and the second pipe 28, respectively. Symbol L represents the length of the mixing chamber 20; D1, the diameter of the mixing chamber 20; D2, the diameter (orifice diameter) of the first nozzle 34; D3, the diameter (orifice diameter) of the second nozzle 36; D4, the diameter of the discharge pipe 26; and Z, the direction along which the maximum velocity of the solution Y jetted out from the first nozzle 34 is exhibited.",
        "The velocity of the solution jetted out from the first nozzle 34 is preferably from 10 m/sec to 360 m/sec, and particularly preferably from 10 m/sec to 100 m/sec.",
        "As a method for digging the first and second orifices 30 and 32 in block-form orifice materials 23, there can be preferably used known micro-cutting, micro-grinding, blasting, micro electric discharge machining, LIGA processing, laser machining, SPM machining, or some other processing, each of which is known as a processing for accurately opening a nozzle (hole) for jetting having an opening diameter of about 100 \u03bcm in the orifice materials 23 made of metal, ceramic, glass or the like.",
        "The orifice materials 23 are preferably made of a substance which has good workability and is as hard as diamond. Preferred examples of the substance besides diamond include various metals or alloys subjected to hardening treatment such as quenching, nitrogen hardening, or sintering. Ceramics can also be preferably used since they have high hardness and are superior in workability to diamond. In the present embodiment, the jetting structure of the first and second nozzles 34 and 36 are the orifice structure as an example, but may be any other structure that has a function of jetting turbulent liquid.",
        "Non-illustrated pressurizing means are fitted to the first and second pipes 24 and 28. The solution Y and the solution X are supplied into the first and second nozzles 34 and 36 under pressure. As the pressurizing means for applying high pressure to liquid, various means are known. Any one thereof may be used. Preferably, a reciprocating pump such as a plunger pump or a booster pump is used since the pump is relatively available and inexpensive. Out of rotary pumps, which make it impossible to generate higher pressure than the reciprocating pump, high-pressure generating-type rotary pumps may be used.",
        "The solution Y is jetted out, in the form of turbulent straightly-going flow A, from the first nozzle 34 to the mixing chamber 20, and the solution X is jetted out, in the form of orthogonal flow B which is substantially orthogonal to the straightly-going flow A, from the second nozzle 36 to the mixing chamber 20, so as to mix the two solutions to react with each other. Thus, the mixed reaction solution 40 which contains metal fine-particles or metal hydroxide fine-particles is produced. In this case, the orthogonal flow B is allowed not to be completely orthogonal at an angle of 90\u00b0 to the straightly-going flow A, and it at least has, as the main component, a velocity vector component in the orthogonal direction. In FIG. 1, the second nozzle 36 for jetting out the orthogonal flow B is arranged above the mixer 22, but may be arranged below the mixer 22 or on a side thereof. In short, it is sufficient for the present embodiment that the orthogonal flow B can be jetted out so as to be substantially orthogonal to the straightly-going flow A.",
        "FIG. 2 is a view which schematically illustrates such mixing reaction. The orthogonal flow B jetted out from the direction which is substantially orthogonal to the straightly-going flow A is caused to be involved in following wake flow followed (entrained) in the turbulent straightly-going flow A having a high velocity, thereby a large eddy viscosity generated by the mixing of the turbulent straightly-going flow A and the orthogonal flow B is utilized, to give a high mixing efficiency. In FIG. 2, the hatched region of symbol C schematically represents the eddy viscosity, and symbol P represents a substantial central portion of the eddy viscosity C.",
        "The mixing chamber 20, the first and second nozzles 34 and 36, and the discharge pipe 26 in the static mixing apparatus 12 are formed to have the following relationship: It is necessary that the eddy viscosity is generated in the mixing chamber 20; the velocity of straightly-going flow A is reduced in order to generate the eddy viscosity; the diameter D1 of the mixing chamber 20 is therefore made larger than the diameter D2 of the first nozzle 34; and the eddy viscosity generated by the straightly-going flow A is important to make the mixing efficiency good, and the dimensional ratio of the diameter D1 of the mixing chamber 20 to the diameter D2 of the first nozzle 34 is preferably within the range from 1.1 to 1000, more preferably within the range from 1.1 to 100.",
        "In order to cause the orthogonal flow B to be easily involved in the straightly-going flow A, the flow velocity of the jetted-out orthogonal flow B is preferably equivalent to or less than the flow velocity of the jetted-out straightly-going flow A. Specifically, the flow velocity ratio of the flow velocity of the jetted-out orthogonal flow B to the flow velocity of the jetted-out straightly-going flow A is preferably from 0.01 to 0.4, more preferably from 0.01 to 0.1. The flow velocity of the jetted-out straightly-going flow A is equal to the velocity of the solution jetted out from the first nozzle 34.",
        "The position of the introducing nozzle (the second nozzle), which is a jetting-out port for the orthogonal flow B, is very important. It is necessary to jet the orthogonal flow B into the mixing chamber 20 at a position before the position where the eddy viscosity C generated by jetting the straightly-going flow A from the small-diameter first nozzle 34 to the larger-diameter mixing chamber 20 would be maximum. It is necessary to arrange the second nozzle 36 between the first nozzle 34 and the position of the maximum of the eddy viscosity C. It is therefore necessary to know the position where the eddy viscosity C is maximum. The position, in the mixing chamber 20, where the eddy viscosity C is maximum, can be grasped by performing simulation beforehand using a numerical analysis software R-Flow, manufactured by R-Flow Co., which is well known as a fluid analysis software commercially available in Japan. In this case, the position where the eddy viscosity C is maximum is not a point but has a region as can be understood from FIG. 2. Therefore, the position of the maximum of the eddy viscosity C may be regarded as the point P, which is the substantially central portion of the eddy viscosity C. Thus, the second nozzle 36 should be positioned before the point P. Preferably, the second nozzle 36 is positioned so that the orthogonal B can be jetted out at the initial stage of the generation of the eddy viscosity C. A plurality of the discharge nozzles for the orthogonal flow B may be used.",
        "In this connection, when the mixing apparatus has no mixing chamber 20 for generating the eddy viscosity C or the first and second nozzles 34 and 36 have an inappropriate positional relationship, the straightly-going flow A, followed by the orthogonal flow B added in the midway, is taken out from the mixing site before the flow A is mixed with the flow B, or alternatively the mixing site needs to be very long, in order to make the mixing of the flows complete. This causes time interval between the initial and the final of the mixing becomes long, and the particle size distribution of the resultant metal fine-particles or metal hydroxide fine-particles becomes wide.",
        "From results of analysis by the above-mentioned numerical analysis software, the region (P) where the eddy viscosity C makes its appearance has a relationship with the flow velocity of the straightly-going flow A, and substantially corresponds to a position where the maximum velocity of the straightly-going flow A, (which is generally the flow velocity at the first nozzle outlet (position)), is reduced to 1/10  thereof. Accordingly, if the position where the maximum velocity of the straightly-going flow A is reduced to 1/10  thereof is calculated and the second nozzle 36 is positioned in such a manner that the orthogonal flow B can be jetted before the point, it is unnecessary to calculate the point P. This is because: a high eddy viscosity is generated when the velocity of high velocity fluid is reduced; therefore it is necessary to perform the mixing before the reduction of the velocity is finished.",
        "That is, the second nozzle 36, which is a jetting-out port of the orthogonal flow B, is set to a position in the region where the velocity Vz of the straightly-going flow A is represented by the following formula (1), in the direction along which the maximum velocity of the straightly-going flow A is exhibited when the flow A is jetted to the mixing chamber (i.e., in the Z direction):\n\n( 1/10)Vz0<Vz<Vz0\u2003\u2003Formula (1)",
        "wherein Vz0 represents the velocity of the straightly-going flow at the outlet of the nozzle in the direction along which the maximum velocity of the straightly-going flow is exhibited when the straightly-going flow is jetted into the mixing camber.",
        "It is also necessary to keep the length L (see FIG. 1) of the mixing chamber 20 necessary for making the eddy viscosity C generated in the mixing chamber 20 maximum. If the length of the mixing chamber 20 is too long, the mixed reaction solution 40 remains or flows backward easily in the mixing chamber 20 so that bad effect is caused on (nano-)miniaturization of the particle size of the metal particles or the metal hydroxide fine-particles or the mono-dispersibility thereof. Thus, the length L of the mixing chamber 20 is preferably from 2 to 5 times (more preferably from 2 to 3 times) the distance from the first nozzle 34 to the point P, where the eddy viscosity C is maximum.",
        "When liquid at a high flow velocity is jetted out from the small-diameter first nozzle 34 or second nozzle 36 to the larger-diameter mixing chamber 20, cavitation is easily caused. By the cavitation, a gas-liquid interface is formed in the mixing chamber 20 so that the mixing efficiency is lowered. Thus, in order to use the eddy viscosity C to raise the mixing efficiency, it is necessary not to form any gas-liquid interface in the mixing chamber 20. As illustrated in FIG. 1, therefore, it is preferable to use a third orifice 38 to narrow the diameter D4 of the discharge pipe 26, thereby making the diameter D4 smaller than the cylinder diameter D1 of the mixing chamber 20; and mix the two solutions in the state that pressure in the mixing chamber 20 is raised. In this way, the problem of cavitation can be solved, and the mixing efficiency can be further improved. In order to shorten the period of time when the mixed reaction solution remains in portions which do not contribute to mixing inside the discharge pipe 26 as short as possible, it is advisable to narrow the outlet of the mixing chamber 20 and further shorten the discharge pipe 26 having at least a smaller inner diameter than the cylinder diameter D1 of the mixing chamber 20 as much as possible and connect the discharge pipe 26 to a tank for crystal-growth. (not illustrated).",
        "The dimensional ratio of the diameter D1 of the mixing chamber 20 to the diameter D4 of the discharge pipe 26 is preferably within the range of from 1.4 to 10, more preferably within the range of from 2 to 5.",
        "The shapes of the jetted flows jetted out from the first and second nozzles 34 and 36 to the mixing chamber 20 are regulated by the first and second orifices 30 and 32 fitted to the first and second nozzles 34 and 36, respectively. These jetted flow shapes have influence on the performance of mixing. It is therefore preferred to use appropriately the first orifice 30 for generating a jetted flow shape, such as a tread line, conical, slit or fan shape, dependently on the purpose of the mixing reaction. For example, in the case of reaction having a very large reaction rate in millisecond order, it is necessary to jet the straightly-going flow A and the orthogonal flow B so as to make the eddy viscosity C maximum instantaneously in a region which is as small as possible. Thus, the first orifice 30 is preferably an orifice for generating a jetted flow in a thread line form. In the case of reaction having a relatively small reaction rate, it is preferred to jet the straightly-going flow A and the orthogonal flow B so as to make the eddy viscosity C maximum in a region which is as wide as possible, thereby increasing the entraining region area generated by the straightly-going flow A. In this case, the first orifice 30 is preferably an orifice for generating a jetted flow in a thin film form. In the case of reaction having a middle reaction rate, between the very large reaction rate that is in order of milliseconds and the relatively small reaction rate, the first orifice 30 is preferably an orifice for generating a jetted flow in a conical form.",

        "It is stated in \u201cChemical Engineering Outline\u201d (written by Haruo Hikita, and edited by Asakura Shoten Co., Ltd.) that Reynolds' numbers of fluid in pipes having a noncircular section, for example, the slit-form first orifice 30 illustrated in FIGS. 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c), can be handled as follows: when S represents the sectional area of the fluid, and lp represents the length of the periphery of the solid wall contacting the fluid, the corresponding diameter De is defined by: De=4S/lp. Since the slit-form orifice has a closed-groove structure, lp is represented by: lp=2(a+b) wherein a represents the length of the short side and b represents the length of the long side. Therefore, the corresponding diameter De is represented by the following formula (2).\n\nDe=4(ab)/2(a+b)=2ab/(a+b)\u2003\u2003Formula (2)",
        "When turbulence represented in the present invention is calculated, the above De calculated from the formula (2) can be used as the equivalent circle diameter.",
        "The following will describe a method of using the static mixing apparatus 12 having the above-mentioned structure to form metal particles or metal hydroxide fine-particles.",
        "First, the solution Y is jetted out, in the form of the turbulent straightly-going flow A, from the first nozzle 34 to the mixing chamber 20. The solution X is jetted, in the form of the orthogonal flow B, from the second nozzle 36, which is substantially orthogonal to the straightly-going flow A, to a position before the position where the eddy viscosity C, which is generated by jetting out the straightly-going flow A from the small-diameter first nozzle 34 to the larger-diameter mixing chamber 20, would be maximum, or to a position before the position where the maximum velocity of the straightly-going flow A would be reduced to 1/10  or less thereof. In this way, the orthogonal flow B is carried by the straightly-going flow A, thereby mixing the two solutions to react each other in an instant. Then, the resultant mixed reaction solution 40 is discharged from the discharge pipe 26.",
        "In the mixing reaction using the eddy viscosity C, there are two methods for improving the mixing reactivity in the chamber 20.",
        "The first method thereof is a method of jetting out the straightly-going flow A in the form of a thread line at a high velocity, to make the eddy viscosity C maximum instantaneously in a region which is as small as possible. It is preferred for this method to use the first orifice 30 for generating thread line form jetted flow, as illustrated in FIGS. 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c), as the first orifice 30 of the first nozzle 34 for jetting out the straightly-going flow A.",
        "From the viewpoint of the mixing, it is more preferred that the straightly-going flow A is high-velocity flow. However, in order to control the reaction product in this case to desired particle sizes and a desired size distribution, it is essential to consider influence on the reaction of frictional heat resulting from liquid-liquid friction generated by the high velocity flow. It is effective as measures against this friction heat to lower the temperature of the reaction solution beforehand and use this reaction solution; cool the reaction solution by means of the adding-pipes, orifice sections, mixing chamber section and discharging section which are made to have a double wall structure, and use them; or perform both of these two measures. The velocity of the high velocity flow is determined by the jetted-out pressure applied dependently on the jetted-out flow rate and by the inner diameter of the first orifice 30; therefore, in order to produce higher velocity flow, it is necessary to make the inner diameter of the first orifice 30 as small as possible and raise the pressure applied to the liquid. Accordingly, the abrasion of the first orifice 30 becomes a more serious problem as the velocity of high velocity flow becomes larger. However, this problem can be overcome by the use of highly durable material such as diamond.",
        "The second method is a method of making the straightly-going flow A to thin film form jetted flow, thereby increasing the entraining region formed by the straightly-going flow A. It is preferred for this method to use the first orifice 30 for generating slit or fan form jetted flow, as illustrated in FIGS. 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c), and FIGS. 6(a), 6(b) and 6(c), as the first orifice 30 of the first nozzle 34 for jetting out the straightly-going flow A. In this case, it is necessary to adjust the flow velocity of the jetted-out orthogonal flow B in such a manner that the orthogonal flow B does not break the thin film of the straightly-going flow A. It is more preferred to make the second orifice 32 of the second nozzle 36 into a form as illustrated in FIGS. 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c) or FIGS. 6(a), 6(b) and 6(c) and make the orthogonal flow B to slit or fan form and thin film-like jetted flow in the same manner as the straightly-going flow A.",
        "Since the second method makes it possible to ensure a larger eddy viscosity region, a good mixing performance can be obtained even if the flow velocity of the jetted-out straightly-going flow A is made smaller than that in the case of the thread line form jetted flow. Consequently, the abrasion resistance of the first and second orifices 30 and 32 is improved, to make it possible that the orifices can be made of a metal, a treated metal product, a ceramic or some other material, each of which has good workability. Moreover, by making the flow velocity of the straightly-going flow small, the generation of frictional heat can be suppressed. Therefore, metal particles or metal hydroxide fine-particles having finer particle sizes can be formed.",
        "As described above, the static mixing apparatus 12 that can be used in the present invention has been made on the basis of an unprecedented idea; and by using the static mixing apparatus 12, the following advantageous effects can be exhibited.\n\n    (1) The static mixing apparatus is made to have a structure for generating eddy viscosity, thereby an excellent mixing reaction state for static mixing can be obtained; therefore, metal particles or metal hydroxide fine-particles having fine particle sizes and excellent mono-dispersibility can be formed.\n    (2) Eddy viscosity is used to cause the solution Y and the solution X to be mixed and react with each other, thereby a good mixing performance can be obtained even if the flow velocity of the jetted-out solution Y or X is made small. Thus, the pressure of the jetted-out flow can be lowered. In this way, the easiness of the production of the apparatus, and the safety and maintainability of the apparatus can be improved. In particular, the material of the first and second orifices 30 and 32 can be changed to an inexpensive and workable material other than diamond.\n    (3) At least the straightly-going flow is jetted out in a thin film form, thereby the solution Y and the solution X can be caused to be mixed and react with each other at high concentrations. In this way, seed particles of metal particles or metal hydroxide fine-particles can be formed or caused to grow at such a high concentration level that industrial profit can be produced.",

In the ultrafiltration, Viva Flow 50 (Trade name) made by Sartorius AG was used. The fine-particle colloid dispersion was applied onto a glass substrate by spin coating, dried at 80\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, and then fired in an electric furnace at 450\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes. The sample thus-obtained after the firing was measured by X-ray diffraction analysis. As a result, it was identified that indium oxide was generated.",
