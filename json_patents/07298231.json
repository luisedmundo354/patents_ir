        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a surface acoustic wave device suitably employed for a filter element, a duplexer, and so forth and carrying a plurality of surface acoustic wave elements respectively having different frequency pass bands, and a communication apparatus comprising the surface acoustic wave device. The communication apparatus is employed for a mobile communication apparatus such as a cellular phone, for example.",
        "2. Description of Related Art",
        "In a communication apparatus such as a cellular phone, a surface acoustic wave device using a surface acoustic wave element comprising an IDT (Inter Digital Transducer) electrode as a duplexer for separating a transmission signal and a receiving signal. The surface acoustic wave device is a small in size, has steep filter element characteristics, and has superior properties such as superior mass productivity.",
        "Particularly in recent years, a small-sized surface acoustic wave device having a transmitting filter element and a receiving filter element integrated with each other is required in the surface acoustic wave device in order to make the communication apparatus small in size and lightweight. Although it goes without saying that low insertion loss is required as the filter element, a larger attenuation is required for out-of-band attenuation characteristics.",
        "If the respective out-of-band attenuation characteristics of the transmitting filter element and the receiving filter element are degraded, an unnecessary radio signal is transmitted or received, thereby causing the possibilities that the quality of the received radio signal is degraded, and there arise problems such as interference with another radio communication apparatus.",
        "The out-of-band attenuation characteristics of the conventional surface acoustic wave device cannot sufficiently cope with the foregoing requirements. A further improvement is desired.",
        "The present invention has been devised in view of the foregoing desires, and has for its object to provide a surface acoustic wave device that comprises a high-frequency side filter element and a low-frequency side filter element, is superior in out-of-band attenuation characteristics of the filter elements, can be miniaturized, and is high in reliability.",
        "A surface acoustic wave device according to the present invention comprise a first filter element formed on one main surface of a piezoelectric substrate, and comprising first input/output electrodes, a first ground electrode, and a first IDT electrode; a second filter element formed on the same surface of the piezoelectric substrate, comprising second input/output electrodes, a second ground electrode, and a second IDT electrode, and having a different frequency band from the first filter element; and a circuit board for mounting the surface of the piezoelectric substrate, the first ground electrode and the second ground electrode being electrically separated from each other on the surface of the piezoelectric substrate, a first grounding conductor terminal connected to the first ground electrode and a second grounding conductor terminal connected to the second ground electrode being separated from each other on a surface, on which the piezoelectric substrate is mounted, of the circuit board, a third ground electrode being provided on a surface on the side opposite to the surface, on which the piezoelectric substrate is mounted, of the circuit board or any inner layer surface of the circuit board, and first and second via conductors respectively connected to the first grounding conductor terminal and the second grounding conductor terminal and penetrating the circuit board down to the position of the third ground electrode.",
        "According to this configuration, the two filter elements can be formed on the same piezoelectric substrate, thereby making it possible to make the surface acoustic wave device smaller in size and make a mounting area on the circuit board smaller, as compared with those in a case where they are respectively formed on separate piezoelectric substrates. The out-of-band attenuation characteristics of the first filter element and the second filter element can be respectively reduced to desired values by providing the first and second via conductors for grounding the filter elements. Therefore, the surface acoustic wave device can be made high in reliability.",
        "In the above-mentioned configuration, the surface acoustic wave device according to the present invention is characterized in that the pass band of the first filter element is lower than the pass band of the second filter element, and a series inductance of the first ground electrode, the first grounding conductor terminal, and the first via conductor is higher than a series inductance of the second ground electrode, the second grounding conductor terminal, and the second via conductor.",
        "Each of the first filter element and the second filter element comprises a series IDT electrode connected between the input/output electrodes and a parallel IDT electrode connected between a signal line and the ground.",
        "An effect produced by the configuration will be discussed.",
        "FIG. 1 is a diagram showing an equivalent circuit of the IDT electrode. The impedance of the IDT electrode is represented by a complex Z1.",
        "The series inductance of the first ground electrode, the first grounding conductor terminal, and the first via conductor is represented by Lg1, and the series inductance of the second ground electrode, the second grounding conductor terminal, and the second via conductor is represented by Lg2. Lg1 and Lg2 are generically referred to as \u201cLg\u201d.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates a circuit obtained by connecting the series inductance Lg in series with the circuit shown in FIG. 1. The impedance of the circuit shown in FIG. 2 is represented by the sum of Z1 and Lg, and is denoted by \u201cZ\u201d. Let X be a reactance component of Z, and let R be a resistance component.",
        "FIG. 3 is a graph using the reactance X to enter its vertical axis and using a frequency to enter its horizontal axis. The parameter of each of curves in the graph is the value of Lg.",
        "The reactance X has a resonance point at a certain frequency fr0, and has an anti-resonance point at a frequency fa0 higher than the frequency fr0.",
        "As can be seen from the graph, the larger the value of Lg is, the lower both the resonance frequency fr0 and the anti-resonance frequency fa0 become because the curve is raised upward.",
        "FIG. 4 shows a graph using the absolute value |Z| of each of the respective impedances of the parallel IDT and the series IDT electrode in the first filter element and the parallel IDT electrode and the series IDT electrode in the second filter element to enter its vertical axis and a graph using the attenuation of each of the first filter element and the second filter element to enter its vertical axis. A common frequency is used to enter the horizontal axis of the graph.",
        "As can be seen from the combined graphs, assuming that the impedance of the parallel IDT electrode in the first filter element is reduced in the vicinity of the anti-resonance frequency, as indicated by an arrow b, the attenuation on the high-frequency side outside the pass band of the first filter element can be increased (see an arrow d). On the other hand, assuming that the impedance of the parallel IDT electrode in the second filter element is reduced in the vicinity of the resonance frequency, as indicated by an arrow a, the attenuation on the low-frequency side outside the pass band of the second filter element can be increased (see an arrow c).",
        "It is found that the series inductance Lg1 of the first filter element may be increased, as indicated by an arrow e in FIG. 3, in order to reduce the impedance of the parallel IDT electrode in the first filter element in the vicinity of the anti-resonance frequency, while the series inductance Lg2 of the second filter element may be reduced, as indicated by an arrow f shown in FIG. 3, in order to reduce the impedance of the parallel IDT electrode in the second filter element in the vicinity of the resonance frequency.",
        "When a parasitic inductance produced at the grounding conductor terminal in the second filter element is thus reduced, the impedance Z in a band overlapped with the frequency band of the first filter element can be reduced with respect to the parallel IDT electrode in the second filter element.",
        "As a result, it is possible to effectively prevent a signal passing through the band overlapped with the frequency band and to improve the out-of-band attenuation characteristics on the low-frequency side of the second filter element.",
        "When a parasitic inductance produced at the grounding conductor terminal in the first filter element is increased, the impedance Z in a band overlapped with the frequency band of the second filter element can be decreased with respect to the parallel IDT electrode in the first filter element.",
        "As a result, it is possible to effectively prevent a signal passing through the band overlapped with the frequency band and to improve the out-of-band attenuation characteristics on the high-frequency side of the first filter element.",
        "In order to realize the above-mentioned decrease and increase in the parasitic inductance, it is considered that the area on the piezoelectric substrate of the first ground electrode is made smaller than the area on the piezoelectric substrate of the second ground electrode, the number of the first via conductors is made smaller than the number of the second via conductors, the first via conductor is formed in a crank shape, the second via conductor is formed in a liner shape, and the cross-sectional area of the first via conductor is made smaller than the cross-sectional area of the second via conductor.",
        "In the surface acoustic wave device having the above-mentioned configuration, if the pass band of the receiving filter element is higher than the pass band of the transmitting filter element, the parasitic inductance produced at the grounding conductor terminal in the receiving filter element is reduced, and the parasitic inductance produced at the grounding conductor terminal in the transmitting filter element is increased, thereby making it possible to achieve improvements in the out-of-band attenuation characteristics, which are their respective objectives, and to obtain good communication quality in a case where it is used for a duplexer in the communication apparatus.",
        "In each of the above-mentioned configurations, a surface acoustic wave device according to the present invention has a configuration in which an annular electrode surrounding the first and second filter elements is formed on the surface, having the first and second filter elements formed thereon, of the piezoelectric substrate, and an annular conductor connected to the annular electrode is formed on the surface, on which the piezoelectric substrate is mounted, of the circuit board. In this configuration, the surface acoustic wave element can be hermetically sealed and protected from outside air by the piezoelectric substrate, the circuit board, the annular electrode, and the annular conductor, which allows the surface acoustic wave element to be stably operated for a long time period. Therefore, the surface acoustic wave device can be made high in reliability.",
        "The annular conductor may surround each of the filter elements. In this case, the annular electrodes respectively function as electromagnetic shields for the filter elements, so that electromagnetic coupling of the filter elements can be eliminated, and interference between the filter elements can be restrained.",
        "The surface acoustic wave device according to the present invention employs a configuration in which the second ground electrode in the second filter element is connected to the annular electrode, and the annular conductor serving as the second grounding conductor terminal is connected to a third ground electrode by the plurality of second via conductors.",
        "This configuration utilizes the annular electrode and the annular conductor in order to reduce the inductance of the ground electrode.",
        "The surface acoustic wave device according to the present invention employs a configuration in which the second grounding conductor terminal is connected to the annular conductor, and the annular conductor is connected to the third ground electrode by a plurality of third via conductors.",
        "This configuration utilizes the annular conductor in order to reduce the inductance of the grounding conductor terminal.",
        "According to the configurations, the parasitic inductance can be reduced without newly manufacturing a ground electrode or a grounding conductor terminal having a large area in the second filter element. Therefore, the surface acoustic wave device according to the present invention can be made smaller in size.",
        "A communication apparatus according to the present invention comprises the above-mentioned surface acoustic wave device, and a receiving circuit and/or a transmission circuit each using the surface acoustic wave device as a circuit element.",
        "The communication apparatus can be significantly miniaturized by eliminating the necessity of a large-sized dielectric filter element as in the conventional example. Therefore, the communication apparatus can be made small in size and superior in communication quality.",
        "An unnecessary out-of-band signal can be sufficiently removed by using the high-frequency side filter element having good out-of-band attenuation characteristics for the receiving filter element, for example, thereby allowing the quality of a receiving signal to be improved. Further, a communication signal superior in quality can be transmitted without transmitting an unnecessary out-of-band signal by using the low-frequency side filter element having good out-of-band attenuation characteristics for the transmitting filter element, for example. Therefore, the communication apparatus can be made superior in power resistance.",
        "The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",

        "The surface acoustic wave device 100 is formed on a piezoelectric substrate 300, and two types of filter elements that differ in pass bands are formed therein.",
        "In the embodiment of the present invention, the filter element having the lower frequency band is used as a transmitting filter element TX, and the filter element having the higher frequency band is used as a receiving filter element RX.",
        "In FIG. 5, on one main surface of the piezoelectric substrate 300, an IDT electrode 110, a ground electrode 312, and signal input/output electrodes 311 in the transmitting filter element TX are formed, and an IDT electrode 120, a ground electrode 322, and signal input/output electrodes 321 in the receiving filter element RX are formed.",

        "Furthermore, an annular electrode 330 having a substantially square shape is formed so as to surround the IDT electrode 110, the IDT electrode 120, and so forth on one main surface of the piezoelectric substrate 300.",
        "The annular electrode 330 is thus provided along an outer edge of the piezoelectric substrate 300, which allows the IDT electrode 110, the IDT electrode 120, and so forth to be effectively arranged inside thereof utilizing a large area.",
        "The annular electrode 330 may be formed so as to surround each of the transmitting filter element TX and the receiving filter element RX. When the annular electrode 330 is formed so as to surround each of the transmitting filter element TX and the receiving filter element RX, the annular electrode 330 functions as an electromagnetic shield for each of the filter elements, thereby making it possible to eliminate an electromagnetic coupling between the filter elements and to restrain interference between the filter elements.",
        "FIG. 6 illustrates a circuit board 200 for mounting the piezoelectric substrate 300. Signal input/output conductor terminals 411 in the transmitting filter element TX, a grounding conductor terminal 412 in the transmitting filter element TX, signal input/output conductor terminals 421 in the receiving filter element RX, and a plurality of grounding conductor terminals 422 in the receiving filter element RX are respectively formed on an upper surface of the circuit board 200.",

An annular conductor 430 is formed so as to surround the terminals in correspondence with the annular electrode 330 in the piezoelectric substrate 300.",

        "The reverse grounding conductor terminal 220 is formed in a large area on the reverse surface of the circuit board 200, and serves as a ground terminal common to the grounding conductor terminal 412 in the transmitting filter element TX and the grounding conductor terminals 422 in the receiving filter element RX. The ground terminal functions as a third ground electrode.",

        "Hermeticity on the side of an operating surface of the piezoelectric substrate 300 can be kept by the above-mentioned annular sealing, which allows the surface acoustic wave element 100 to be stably operated without being affected by a protective material 500 or the like as well as allowing the operation to be stably performed for a long time period. Therefore, the surface acoustic wave device can be made high in reliability.",
        "Furthermore, degradation by oxidation, for example, of each of the electrodes and the conductor terminals can be effectively prevented by sealing nitrogen gas serving as inert gas, for example, into a portion hermetically sealed in an annular shape by the annular electrode 330 and the annular conductor 430. Therefore, the surface acoustic wave device can be made higher in reliability.",
        "It is preferable that the width of the annular electrode 330 is within a range from 0.05 mm to 0.15 mm, for example, in consideration of sealing properties by a brazing material such as a solder and positioning precision. If the width is smaller than 0.05 mm, it is difficult to satisfy sealing properties by a solder and reliability by mechanical stress. On the other hand, if the width is larger than necessary, it is difficult for the transmitting filter element TX and the receiving filter element RX to be effectively arranged using a large area inside of the annular electrode 330. Therefore, the width of the annular electrode 330 may be suitably set depending on properties and specifications required for the surface acoustic wave device.",
        "Although in this example, one transmitting filter element TX and one receiving filter element RX are formed, and one annular electrode 330 is formed so as to surround the filter elements, a plurality of transmitting filter elements TX and a plurality of receiving filter elements RX may be provided inside of the annular electrode 330.",
        "As described in the foregoing, one main surface of the piezoelectric substrate 300 may be divided into a plurality of areas, to form the transmitting filter element TX and the receiving filter element RX in each of the areas and form the annular electrode 330 so as to surround the filters. In such a case, mutual interference of a transmission signal or a receiving signal between surface acoustic wave devices respectively surrounded by the annular electrodes 330 can be significantly reduced.",
