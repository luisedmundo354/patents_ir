    "abstract": "A system and method are provided for controlling packet header information in a packet communications switch fabric. The method comprises: programming the cell header overhead (OH) field definitions; accepting a packet including a plurality of cells and corresponding cell headers, each cell header including a plurality of overhead fields; defining the cell header OH fields; and, transmitting the packet. Defining the cell header OH fields includes defining cell header OH field location, position, meaning, structure, and length. In other aspects, the method comprises redefining the cell header overhead fields, once they are accepted. For example, the OH field information can be modified, relocated, or an OH field can be added to the cell header. In yet other aspects, the OH field information can be extracted and/or reformatted.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "This invention generally relates to packet communications switching and, more particularly, to a system and method for programming and redefining information in a packet cell header in passage through a switch fabric.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "There is industry demand for integrated circuits (ICs) switching systems that can be easily scaled for Network Access, the Network Edge, or a Core Switch Router, at the high end. SCSA (Signal Computing System Architecture) defines a switch fabric to be the facility for connecting any two (or more) transmitting or receiving Service Providers.",
        "FIG. 24 is a schematic block diagram of a general switch fabric system (prior art). Traffic enters the system on the ingress side (the left side of the figure). Traffic exits the system on the egress side (the right side of the figure). The port card ingress and egress structures are sometimes subdivided into channels and subchannels. The packet headers specify a required destination port card, channel, and subchannel. The system must synchronously route each ingress packet to the correct egress destination.",
        "Packets are converted into frames by ingress traffic managers (iTMs). A frame is a logical unit of data, which is often a small piece of a much larger data set such as a file or image. The iTMs feed the ingress side of the fabric. The switch fabric might convert the frame format to a \u201cnative\u201d format, and then on egress, convert the data back into the TM frame format before sending the data to the egress traffic managers (eTMs). If the frames are fixed size (for example: 53 bytes, 64 bytes, or 80 bytes), the frames are often called cells.",
        "A switch fabric can be protocol specific or protocol agnostic. An example of a protocol specific switch fabric would be a system designed and optimized specifically for asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) traffic. Another example would be a switch that handles only TCP/IP traffic. The obvious disadvantage of a switch fabric hardwired to handle a specific protocol is lack of flexibility. Service providers want to sell services to a variety of customers in various industries. Protocols vary from industry to industry.",
        "Even within one protocol type, there can be protocol upgrades. For example, TCP/IP, the machine language of Internet routers, now runs primarily \u201cIPv4.\u201d This protocol, successful as it has been, has a lack of available addresses, poor security features, and no \u201cquality of service\u201d (QoS) provisions. The next generation Internet protocol is \u201cIPv6.\u201d It provides solutions to these limitations.",
        "A protocol agnostic switch fabric works equally well with all protocol types, however, the traffic manager must be responsible for recognizing specific protocol types. The disadvantage of a protocol agnostic switch fabric is that it may be more complicated, and perhaps slower than a switch fabric dedicated to a particular protocol.",
        "The simplest way for a traffic manager to transmit a packet into a switch fabric is to transmit the packet serially along one line. Striping is a way of achieving higher bandwidth by transmitting a single packet across multiple ingress/egress lines. For example, a TM can transmit a packet into a switch fabric eight times as fast if the packet is sliced into eight pieces (stripes) by the TM, and conveyed into the fabric along 8 parallel lines simultaneously. The fabric captures the packet in memory, routes it to the required egress destination, and slices the packet into 8 parallel lines before transmitting the packet to the egress TM.",
        "The upside to packet striping is the potential for lower latency. There are several negative aspects of packet striping:",
        "if one of the links is damaged (1 of 8 in the example above), the entire channel is out of service, degrading fault tolerance; and,",
        "the interface between the TM and switch fabric is more complicated. Circuitry must be used to slice the packet into stripes and reassemble it into packets.",
        "Many switch fabrics now deployed and passing revenue traffic, especially in wide area networks (WANs), use asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) packets. ATM packets are single-cell packets, with a fixed cell size of 53 bytes, 48 bytes of which is the information payload. The ATM specification evolved in the 1980s and early 1990s. It was then believed that variable length (multi-cell) packets would be too difficult to implement at rates needed for wire-speed traffic. The single-cell solution was a compromise that would work for voice data, video data, multimedia data, email data, file data, etc. With a fixed frame size, switch designs are simplified and ultimately faster.",
        "However, files are better sent in large frames. Voice switching performs better with small bursts of data, corresponding to analog-to-digital converter time slots. Large frames and concomitant switching latencies can render a switch useless for most 2-way voice applications. Voice communications require low latency (time delay). Since ATM had to work for all network data, the small payload (voice) requirements prevailed at the expense of the large frame applications.",
        "For large frames or packets it is much more efficient to establish a path from an ingress port card to the required egress destination, and then leave this path undisturbed until the packet is completed. With single cell packets, the ingress port card must bid for, accept grants, and then schedule each cell of a multi-cell packet.",
        "There are also Frame Relay switch fabrics. Frame Relay is a single-cell protocol, albeit with frame size ranging from 6 to 4096 bytes. Such switch fabrics have been deployed and passing revenue traffic since the early 1990s. These switch fabrics have generally not been used for voice data because of the large latency. Only high compressed voice traffic works well over frame relay. Voice-over-frame relay was added as an afterthought by network engineers. Frame relay excels at data communications such as local area network internetworking (LAN-to-LAN). Such communications are very high speed and bursty, with non-critical latency constraints.",
        "The conventional method of switch fabric packet routing is called Store-and-Forward. In this method, the switch fabric accepts an input packet and buffers the packet on the ingress side of the fabric, making sure the packet was received intact, knowing the exact number of cells in the packet. The problem with the store-and-forward method is the added latency of buffering the packet. In Cut-through Packet Routing (CPR), a switch fabric is able to send the incoming packet cells to the correct egress port as soon as the destination address is known.",
        "A switch fabric can use memory-based crossbars or arbitrated crossbars. A memory-based crossbar is sometimes called a \u201cshared memory switch.\u201d Ingress packets flow from the port cards into a huge memory bank, which serve as the switch. From the memory bank, the destination address is determined from egress port destination information in the cell headers. The problem with these switch fabrics is that they become prohibitively expensive and large from all the required high-speed memory. Such fabrics cannot be used to reach terabit total switching speeds with technology available today.",
        "It would be advantageous if a switch fabric cell header structure could be programmed and defined with respect to interfacing traffic managers.",
        "The present invention describes a switch fabric with programmable cell header information. This programmability permits the switch fabric to be adapted to the characteristics of the interfacing networks. The flexibility in definition, and redefinition, of the overhead information permits the cell header to be used in switch fabric and network control communications.",
        "Accordingly, a method is provided for controlling packet header information in a packet communications switch fabric. The method comprises: programming the cell header overhead (OH) field definitions; accepting a packet including a plurality of cells and corresponding cell headers, each cell header including a plurality of overhead fields; defining the cell header OH fields; and, transmitting the packet. Defining the cell header OH fields includes defining cell header OH field location, position, meaning, structure, and length.",
        "In other aspects, the method comprises redefining the cell header overhead fields, once they are accepted. For example, the OH field information can be modified, relocated, or an OH field can be added to the cell header. In yet other aspects, the OH field information can be extracted and/or reformatted.",
        "A system is also provided for controlling packet header information in a packet communications switch fabric. The system comprises a port card having an input interface to accept a packet including a plurality of cells and corresponding cell headers, where each cell header including a plurality of overhead fields. The port card defines the cell header OH fields and transmits the packet from an output interface. As mentioned above, the cell header OH fields are defined to interface the switch fabric to a network, typically a network of traffic managers.",
        "More specifically, the port card can either be an input port card (IPC) having ingress ports to accept packets and ingress backplane data links to transmit packets, or an output port card (OPC) having egress backplane data links to accept packets and egress ports to transmit packets.",

The port card chiefly defines the cell header OH fields so that it can communicate with an interfacing ingress traffic manager 102 (iTM) and/or egress TM 104 (eTM). As explained in more detail below, the port card defines cell header OH field location, position, meaning, structure, and/or length.",
        "More specifically, the port card can either be an input port card 106 (IPC) or an output port card 108 (OPC). The IPC 106 has ingress ports 1 through a on lines 110 through 112 to accept packets. The IPC 106 transmits packets on ingress backplane data links 1 through b on lines 114 through 116. The OPC 108 accepts packets on egress backplane data links 1 through c on lines 118 through 120 and uses egress ports 1 through d on lines 122 through 124 to transmit packets. The values of a, b, c, and d are not limited to any particular value.",
        "The port cards 106/108 have inputs on lines 126 and 128, respectively, to accept programming instructions for defining cell header OH field. Further, either the IPC 106 and/or the OPC may act to redefine the cell header OH fields. For example, either port card 106/108 may redefine the cell header overhead fields by: modifying OH field information; relocating OH fields in the cell header; and/or adding OH fields to the cell header. Further, either port card 106/108 may extract OH field information from the cell header, or reformat the OH fields in the cell header.",
        "The system 100 further comprises a switch card (SC) 130 with a crossbar 132 having crossbar inputs 1 through f on lines 114 through 136 that are selectively connectable to crossbar outputs 1 through g on lines 138 through 140. The values of f and g are not limited to any particular value. The crossbar 132 (Xbar) transfers packets between the IPC and the OPC. The IPC 106 has ingress backplane data links connected to the crossbar inputs. Likewise, the OPC 108 has egress backplane data links connected to the crossbar outputs. Typically, the system would include a plurality of IPCs, OPCs, and crossbars (not shown). A single crossbar might be connected to a number, or perhaps all of the IPCs and OPCs. Likewise, a single IPC (or OPC) may be connected to a number of crossbars. In other aspects, each port card performs IPC and OPC functions.",
        "The IPC 106 includes an ingress memory subsystem 142 (iMS) having inputs connected to the ingress ports 1 through a for buffering the accepted packets. The iMS 142 has outputs for transmitting buffered packets on the egress backplane data links 1 through b. The IPC 106 may redefine the cell header OH fields buffered in the iMS. The IPC 106 can also be said to define the cell header OH fields that are buffered in the iMS 142, in the sense that IPC communicates and/or operates on the packets using the OH programmed definitions.",
        "Likewise, the OPC 108 includes an egress MS 144 (eMS) having inputs connected to the egress backplane data links 1 through c for buffering accepted packets from the crossbar 132. The eMS 144 has outputs for transmitting the buffered packets on the OPC egress ports 1 through d. The OPC 108 redefines (and/or defines) the cell header OH fields buffered in the eMS.",
        "Typically, the IPC 106 includes an ingress priority queue 146 (iPQ), or other type of scheduling/queuing device, connected to the iMS 142 on line 148, and the crossbar 132 on line 150 for managing the backplane data links. The OPC 108 includes an egress PQ 152 (oPQ) connected to the eMS 144 on line 154 for managing the OPC egress ports. The OPC 108 may also include an iPQ 156, or other scheduling device, connected to the eMS 144 on line 158 for relaying backplane control information to the IPC iPQ 146 on line 160, through the crossbar 132.",
        "The IPC iMS 142 may redefine cell header OH fields by extracting and accepting information from a cell header OH field. For example, the information can be extracted as a function of control communications. The iMS 142 may exchange the information in one OH field from the cell header with information from another OH field. The iMS 142 may also move the position of an OH field in the cell header. In one aspect, the iMS 142 reformats the OH field structure. For example, the iMS 142 may change to formatting from one that is suitable for unicasting (transmitting to a single destination), to one suitable for multicasting. The iMS 142 may add an OH field to the cell header and populate the added OH field with information. In other aspects, the iMS 142 replaces information in an OH field with alternate information. In at least one aspect, the iMS 142 defines a field that is embedded in another field.",
        "Likewise, the OPC eMS 144 redefines the cell header OH fields by extracting information from an OH field and sending the information to the OPC iPQ 156. For example, credit information used in the management of the backplane data links can be extracted and relayed through the iPQ 156. The eMS 144 can extract information from an OH field and sending the information to the OPC oPQ 152. Further, the eMS 144 can redefine cell header OH fields by: exchanging the information in one OH field with information from another OH field; moving the position of an OH field in the cell header; reformatting the OH field structure; adding an OH field to the cell header and populating the added OH field with information; replacing information in an OH field with alternate information; and, extracting information from a field embedded in another field.",
        "In one aspect, the IPC iMS 142 embeds a field of secondary class of service (COS) information inside another field. The OPC eMS 144 extracts the secondary COS information and transmits the packet in response to the secondary COS information. In another aspect, IPC iMS 142 embeds dummy port information in the OH fields associated with unused (unconnected) OPC egress ports. The OPC eMS 144 extracts the dummy port information and transfers the information to the iPQ 156. The OPC iPQ 156 sends the dummy port information to the IPC iPQ 146, and iPQ 146 uses the dummy port information in the management of the backplane data links.",

The AMCC Cyclone switch fabric is based on a set of four highly integrated ICs which contain SERDES and memory in order to reduce the overall system power, routing complexity, and required board area. The chip set consists of the following chips:\n\n    \n    \n        S8505 Priority Queue (PQ)\n        S8605 Arbiter/Crossbar\n        S8805 Earliest Deadline First Queue (EDFQ)\n        S8905 Memory Subsystem (MS).",

The fabric can also be thoughT of as a 512\u00d7512 switch since each channel an be treated as four OC-48 subchannels. In addition to the port cards, there are up to sixteen switching cards (depending on the chosen architecture and organization), which consist of Arbiters and Crossbars.

The increased switching granularity of subchannels restricts the FID field to eight bits, therefore the two MSBs of the 10-bit field in the cell header are dropped from the cell format. The RDY bit is moved into the freed space.

The link synchronizer is responsible for finding the beginning of cells based on the synchronization character. After finding the beginnings of all the incoming cells from the different serial links, it deskews them so that they are all aligned with each other. This function is only used with ViX-v3 cell formats. In OC-48, 2 links are paired together to pass cell information that must be deskewed. In OC-192, 8 links are paired together to pass cell information that must be deskewed. The link deskew mechanism can calibrate out up to 6 clock cycles of skew. The nominal point can be set such that it can calibrate out between 0 to 6 or \u22123 to +3 cycles based on the \u201cSync_Delay\u201d bits as shown in Figure. If a variation in skew is detected during steady-state operation for any of the links, the synchronizer will recalibrate that link. Since there is a FIFO buffer before the deskew, only a FIFO overflow or underflow situation would trigger a recalibration of the deskew mechanism once in steady-state operation. The link synchronization status is reported to the microprocessor interface. After the link deskew mechanism, data is passed to the Memory Subsystem core.",
