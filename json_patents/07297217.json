        "The present invention relates to application of adhesives, and, more particularly, to a low viscosity cyanoacrylate adhesive used for wooden furniture repair or manufacture.",
        "In the past, wooden furniture was made by mechanical fastening systems or the use of epoxy/water based adhesives. These adhesives needed to be pre-applied to the joint and then assembled, thus, not allowing for easy repair of loosened joints. Up to 24 hours was needed for clean up of excessive adhesive and fixturing was required while the adhesive hardened. These adhesives would normally comprise of two or more components which required the measuring of each of the components and the mixing of these components together. Furthermore, the pot life of these mixtures needed to be taken into consideration, making it necessary to take and keep copious notes on the mixtures and each component. Water based adhesives would shrink, thus allowing for gaps in joints which make them susceptible to loosening and squeaking.",
        "The shape and form of any fluid dispenser is primarily due to the type of liquid or flowable material being dispensed therefrom and the use thereof. Adhesive dispensers are frequently styled to direct the material to a desired location which may be of a small area or otherwise in a location difficult to reach, such as the area between the joints of furniture. These dispensers have long applicators or various tubing to achieve the desired result. Some examples of such known dispensers are illustrated in the following patents:",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,217,994 to Koenig et al. illustrates a glue dispenser with a self-closing valve. The upper end of the glue dispenser is cone shaped which is provided with an axial round bore in which a cylindrical rod is located. The glue flows through the space between the round bore and the cylindrical rod by pressure on the bottle.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,760,937 to Evezich discloses a dispenser with a deformable inner container and resilient outer container. A curved nozzle and various cylindrical nozzle extenders attach to the resilient outer container.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,267 to Laverdure shows an dispenser attachment with a squeezable self-closing valve. The neck is shaped in an untapered cylindrical shape including a neck outlet through which material is discharged. A collar is used to secure a discharge nozzle to the neck which extends to a curved quadrant shaped valve.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 3,030,952 to Elder discusses a flexible plastic container for sterile injectable fluids. A tube, connected to a connector, protrudes from the container. The components of the connector, namely a drip tube, needle adapter and needle, dispense of the contents in the container.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 3,105,618 to Whitley discloses a squeeze bottle and fluid distributor. A measuring tube expels liquid from the squeeze bottle.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 3,134,515 to Callahan shows a leak detector apparatus. A test liquid bottle provided with a suitable stopper includes a relatively thin pliable tube slidably fitted therein. The tube permits a considerable degree of control to be exercised by the operator over the zones to which the test fluid is applied. Couplings located in relatively inaccessible places may be tested with greatly increased facility.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 5,261,572 to Strater shows a dropper bottle employing a conventional flexible bottle and cover with a conical tip having a hole in the end thereof. An adapter sits between the mouth of the bottle and a ferrule of a needle and includes a passage for fluid between the bottle and the needle.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 3,572,558 to Hooker illustrates a dropper dispenser with a squeeze bottle and tube. The tube extends through the bottle cap with its discharge end fitted to hold a tip. The tip includes a capillary tube member and elongated drop conveying stem. The tube is deformed to hold the stem in place while allowing a passage for the liquid from the bottle.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,490 to Welsh discloses a dispenser formed with filling and discharge openings at opposite ends with a flexible discharge spout. The discharge spout is elongated and flexible and of uniform very small diameter to control discharge of precise amounts of material directed to desired locations of use.",

        "In the repair and manufacture of wooden furniture, of primary concern is the securing of the joints in a manner where there is no indication of a bonding agent, and where the joints are tight and stay tight. Accordingly, the dispenser and applicator used in wooden furniture need to not only direct the flow to any relatively inaccessible space, but need to prevent leakage of adhesive on other sections of the furniture which is detrimental to the finish.",
        "Many of the applicator tips aforementioned do not tightly encase the dispenser and thus, may easily allow for leaks. Examples of snap-acting securements provide a relatively tight connection, but are only appropriate for a specialized dispenser with snap-engaging members. Other applicator tips described are rigid, not allowing for great flexibility in applying the fluid to relatively inaccessible areas. The previous tips generally end in a rigid, cylindrical opening, which make it more difficult to sparingly apply adhesive between joints of a piece of furniture.",
        "Adhesive discharged from an adhesive dispenser tends to harden inside the closure member, causing a layer of glue which may seal the discharge opening shut, or even seal the closure member to the dispenser. The accumulation of dried adhesive may be difficult if not impossible to remove. Thus, auxiliary tools, such as pliers, etc., are needed in separating the closure member from the adhesive dispenser once the adhesive has been discharged.",
        "In order to avoid the disadvantages of the prior art, the present invention provides a low viscosity cyanoacrylate adhesive and an adhesive bottle with a unique applicator tip and closure member.",
        "A special low viscosity cyanoacrylate adhesive is used for the manufacture and repair of wooden furniture, since it quickly penetrates and bonds wood to wood.

One end 32 of the applicator tip 26 is frustro-prolated to receive the discharge end 18 of a dispenser. The other end 34 tapers into a flexible capillary tube, extending a limited distance from the frustro-prolated portion 32. The tubing terminates with a cylindrical bore of small diameter 34, capable of being flattened or manipulated into a elliptical shape (see FIG. 4). The frustro-prolated end 32, when applied to the conical port member 14, forms a slidably engaging, snapless suction which prevents undesirable leaks therefrom. The applicator tip 26 is not limited for use with the embodied dispenser, it may also be used on other dispensers with similar discharge apertures.",
        "The capillary tube member 34 is capable of being bent into a desired configuration to facilitate the discharge of material to a desired location with accuracy. A wire (not shown), or similar elongate member, may be placed within the capillary tube member 34, allowing for even more precise application of the adhesive.",
        "A second embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIGS. 5 and 6. Referring now to FIG. 5, there is portrayed therein a dispenser 60 which is made up of a squeezable body 62 and discharge member 64 having a conical-shaped port member and axial opening therethrough. An closure member 70 is provided for the conical port member which originates as a manufacture seal when inverted, with its bottom portion 63 sealing off the axial aperture and its side portions 65 extending away from the dispenser. The closure member is then severed along section 68 and used subsequently to secure the dispenser 60 against discharge. The conical port member, closure member and applicator tip are all housed within a removable rectangular member 66.",
        "The applicator tip 26 and closure member 70 may be interchangeably and selectably attached to the conical port member 64, shown in FIG. 6. Once the closure member 70 is originally detached from the conical port member, it is inverted to secure the dispenser 60 against discharge when the material is to be stored.",
        "A desired amount of the contents in the dispenser may be discharged from the applicator tip 26 accurately to a desired location by squeezing the sides of the dispenser body 62. Upon releasing the sides thereof, flow is instantly stopped and may even be retracted into the conical port member 64 from the applicator tip 26.",
        "After use, the applicator tip 26 is cleared by holding the bottle upright and squeezing the dispenser body 62. The dispenser body 62 is released and air returning through the capillary tip 26 clears the tip by velocity of the returning air which is enhanced by gravity from the bottle being in the upright position.",
        "Once the applicator tip is firmly attached to the tiered port member 18 (FIG. 1) or the conical port member 64 (FIG. 5), the cyanoacrylate based adhesive contained within the dispenser 10 is then used to bond or assemble such things as wooden joints 42 of a chair 40, shown in FIG. 7, or other such articles made of wood, ceramic, metal, plastic and rubber, fabric, etc. The applicator tip aids in the proper application of the cyanoacrylate adhesive into the joint 42, leaving no indication of adhesive application. The adhesive is expelled from the dispenser 10 and applied to joints by tracing the joint lines thereof. The wooden furniture that results from this process are cohesive in structure and are ready for immediate use.",
        "The applicator tip is made from a long flexible elongate tube 50, shown in FIG. 8. The tube preferable is fabricated from materials that are tractable, flexible and manipulative, such as polyethylene or similar material, etc., and is uniform in shape and diameter. Heat 55 is applied to the midsection of the elongate tube 50, shown in FIG. 9. The forming of the tube may be accomplished with conventional heat forming tools, electric or cored hot water units. Ultrasonic forming and welding may also be used depending on the type and thickness of the plastic. opposing longitudinal pressure A and B is then applied to either end of the tube as shown in FIG. 10, causing the heated midsection of the tube to stretch, forming a thin cylindrical tube such as a capillary tube. While this pressure is maintained, cutting means 58, shown in FIG. 11, bisect the tube resulting in identical tubing halves 50a and 50b, shown in FIG. 12. A tubing half 50a is then used in the present embodiment as the aforementioned applicator tip, consisting of a frustro-prolated portion 72 and a capillary tube member 74.",
