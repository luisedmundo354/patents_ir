        "Document scanners convert a visible image on a media object, such as and not by way of limitation, a document, photograph or a transparent media, into an electronic form suitable for copying, storing and processing by a computer. A document scanner may be a stand-alone device or integrated with a copier, a facsimile machine, a digital sender, or a multifunction device. Documents, or media objects, to be scanned may generally be classified as either transparent or opaque.",
        "For scanning opaque media, light is reflected off an image on the surface of the document onto a photosensitive device by a process referred to as a reflective scan. The photosensitive device converts received light intensity into one or more electric signals. Transparent media are scanned by passing light therethrough, rather than reflecting the light off, the media. The transmitted light is received by an optics system and directed onto the photosensitive device. Transparent media may include either positive or negative images.",
        "Document scanning systems operable to scan both transparent and opaque documents are available. Some conventional scanners include a separate light source to backlight the image on the transparent media.",

        "In FIG. 2, a cross-sectional side view of reflective scanner 100 of FIG. 1 is shown in a configuration for scanning an image on a transparent media. Scanner 100 comprises an internal lamp 215 that is attached to a carriage 219 operable to impart a linear motion of the lamp along a rail 217 or other carriage guide structure. An optic device 218 may also be located within carriage 219 as well as a photosensitive device 221 which may comprise an array of charge-coupled devices (CCDs) or other photosensitive elements operable to perform optical-to-electrical conversion on incident light. A typical photosensitive device comprises hundred or thousands of individual photosensitive elements. Each photosensitive element is operable to generate a data set, e.g., a 16-bit, 20-bit, or another sample size, that numerically defines the light intensity incident on the respective photosensitive element. Carriage 219 may comprise a housing having a slot 223 that provides a light path through which light passes prior to being directed onto a surface of photosensitive device 221 by optic device 218. Generally, carriage 219 has a home position (X=0) from which scan operations are initiated.",
        "Template 150 is properly positioned on platen 110 of scanner 100. Transparent media object 170 is secured within insert area 160 of template 150 and transparent media adapter 120 is placed on template 150. Transparent media adapter 120 preferably comprises an active illumination source, such as a lamp 240, for backlighting media object 170. Alternatively, a passive transparent media adapter without a backlight source may be used. Adapter 120 may include a translucent panel 235 for enabling light radiating from lamp 240 to pass through a bottom surface of adapter 120. Preferably, transparent media adapter 120 is detachably coupled to scanner 100 via one or more cables 255. Cable 255 may provide power for the lamp 240 and/or other electronic components of the adapter as well as a communication channel between adapter 120 and scanner 100. It is preferable that lamp 215 of carriage 219 is deactivated and adapter lamp 240 of transparent media adapter 120 is activated when scanning images on a transparent media. Light radiating from adapter lamp 240 will pass through translucent panel 235, through transparent media object 170 and through platen 110 whereupon it is passed through optic device 218 and focused onto photosensitive device 221.",
        "FIGS. 3A-3C are respectively a top schematic, a side-sectional schematic, and a front-sectional schematic of carriage 219 implemented according to an embodiment of the present invention. Slot 223 extends along a carriage top surface 219A substantially parallel with a transverse axis 230 of carriage 219. An anterior-posterior axis 231 of carriage 219 is generally aligned along a scan direction defined by the carriage translation direction (X). A light pipe comprising light pipe elements 270A and 270B (collectively referred to as light pipe 270) is disposed on a top surface 219A of carriage 219. In the particular arrangement illustrated, light pipe element 270A is located longitudinally forward of the light pipe element 270B and light pipe element 270B is located laterally from light pipe element 270A although other configurations of light pipe elements 270A and 270B are possible. Notably, light pipe element 270A is located longitudinally forward slot 223 by a distance d.",
        "With reference also to FIG. 4, a primary scan line is sampled by passing light 305A through a first scan line 375A1 (also referred to herein as a primary scan line) of media object 170. The light 305A passes directly into slot 223 and onto optic device 218 after passage through scan line 375A1 and is thereafter focused onto medial region 221A of photosensitive device 221. Medial region 221A comprises a plurality of photosensitive elements that respectively perform optical-to-electrical conversion on the incident light. Each of the photosensitive elements of medial region 221A generates a respective sample 331A-331N of a data set 331 that numerically defines light 305A (and thus scan line 375A1). A secondary scan line 375B1 is sampled by passing light 305B through scan line 375B1 (located a distance d from the primary scan line 375A1) and into incidence with light pipe element 270A concurrently with sampling of primary scan line 375A1. Light pipe element 270A redirects light 305B to element 270B that, in turn, directs light 305B into slot 223. Optic device 218 focuses the redirected light from secondary scan line 375B1 (that is, light 305B) onto distal region 221B of photosensitive device 221. Distal region 221B comprises a plurality of photosensitive elements that respectively perform optical-to-electrical conversion on the incident light 305B. Each of the photosensitive elements of distal region 221B generates a respective sample 332A-332M of a data set 332 that numerically defines light 305B (and thus scan line 375B1)",
        "As most clearly shown by FIG. 3B, light 305B is directed substantially orthogonal with top surface 219A of carriage 219. Upon incidence with light pipe element 270A, light 305B is redirected substantially parallel with top surface 219A until incident with light pipe element 270B. Light pipe element 270B is adapted to redirect light 305B into slot 223 for incidence with optic device 218. As most clearly illustrated in FIG. 3C, the redirected light 305B is focused onto distal region 221B of photosensitive device 221.",
        "Preferably, light pipe 270 is detachably affixed to carriage top surface 219A although the light pipe may be permanently mounted thereto. In one embodiment, the light pipe comprises two elements 270A and 270B. In the illustrative embodiment, first light pipe element 270A is located on top surface 219A near a carriage anterior surface 219B. In general terms, light pipe element 270A is disposed in a forward position on carriage 219 with respect to slot 223. Light pipe 270 may comprise a reflective apparatus, such as a configuration of mirrors, operable to capture light and redirect the captured light onto at least one of photosensitive device distal regions 221B and 221C. Other implementations of light pipe 270 are possible. For example, light pipe 270 may be implemented as an injection molded plastic structure(s), a configuration of prisms comprising optical grade glass, or another suitable device for capturing light directed thereon and redirecting the light to impinge on photosensitive device distal regions 221B and/or 221C.",
        "In the illustrative example, light pipe element 270A is adapted to receive light directed thereon and redirect the received light at an offset (\u03b1) from a plane of the anterior surface 219B of carriage 219 such that the light redirected from light pipe element 270A impinges second light pipe element 270B. It should be noted that light pipe elements 270A and 270B may be of common or different lengths LPA and LPB, respectively. In the case that light pipe elements 270A and 270B are of equal lengths, all light redirected from light pipe element 270A to light pipe element 270B will be redirected at a substantially equivalent offset \u03b1. However, in the case that light pipe element 270A is of a different length than light pipe element 270B, the offset \u03b1 of redirection may vary along the length of light pipe 270A to facilitate incidence of the redirected light with light pipe element 270B. Light pipe 270B has redirection capabilities for directing light impinging thereon into slot 223. Light pipe element 270B is positioned on carriage surface 219A such that light directed onto element 270B is guided into slot 223, impinges optic device 218, and is focused on distal region 221B of photosensitive device 221. Accordingly, primary scan line data is obtained by sampling light 305A impinging medial region 221A that originates from directly above slot 223. Secondary scan line data is obtained by sampling light 305B that impinges light pipe element 270A, is redirected to element 270B, and is redirected into slot 223 thereby.",
        "With reference now to FIGS. 2, 3A-3C, and 6, a procedure for scanning a media object 170 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is described. Carriage 219 is positioned at a scanning origination position, e.g., X=0 (FIG. 2), and lamp 240 of media adapter 120 is activated. The configuration of carriage 219 enables sampling of a scan line 375A1 by collecting light passing through scan line 375A1 and into slot 223 where the light is focused onto medial region 221A of photosensitive device 221. In general, the light collected by optics device 218 for sampling scan line 375A1 is directed substantially orthogonal to top surface 219A and into slot 223. A secondary scan line 375B1 is concurrently sampled with scan line 375A1 in accordance with embodiments of the invention. In the present example, light directed onto scan line 375B1 from lamp 240 is directed orthogonal to surface 219A and onto light pipe element 270A. Light pipe element 270A is adapted to redirect received light along a light path substantially parallel with surface 219A and into incidence with light pipe element 270B. Light pipe element 270B is adapted to receive light directed from element 270A substantially parallel with top surface 219A and redirect the light orthogonally with surface 219A through slot 223. Thus, light 305A passing through a first scan line 375A1 of media object 170 and into slot 223 is collected by optics device 218 and focused onto medial region 221A of photosensitive device 221. Concurrently, light passing through second scan line 375B1 of media object 170 is collected by light pipe 270 and directed onto a distal region 221B of photosensitive device. As carriage 219 is driven along rail 217, subsequent sets of scan lines, e.g., scan lines 375A2-375AM and 375B2-375BN, are sampled in a similar manner. Imaging software is used to assemble the sampled scan lines 375A1-375AM and 375B1-375BN into a contiguous image.",
        "It should be understood that the particular arrangement, implementation, and configuration of light pipe 270 with carriage 219 and photosensitive device 221 is exemplary only. While the illustrative embodiments provide a light pipe of two elements, a light pipe may be implemented from a single light pipe element or may comprise elements in excess of two components. Moreover, while the illustrative embodiments have described focusing light from a secondary scan line onto a distal region of a photosensitive device for concurrent sampling with another scan line by a medial region of the photosensitive device, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to such an implementation. For example, the light from the secondary scan line may be collected and directed towards two distal regions of a photosensitive device surrounding a medial region that provides samples of a primary scan line. It should further be understood that the particular areas of the photosensitive device that respectively sample the primary scan line and the secondary scan line can be modified by software and/or light pipe reconfigurations, and that in the most general terms, the present invention provides a method and mechanism of concurrently sampling two discrete scan lines of a media object with a single photosensitive device by directing the light from a first scan line to a region of the photosensitive device and concurrently directly light from the second scan line to different region of the photosensitive device."
