Due to the dual-mode capability of the mobile node, the mobile node is selectably operable pursuant to the operating protocol of the UMTS and pursuant to the operating protocol of the WLAN.",
        "The mobile node 12 includes apparatus 60 of an embodiment of the present invention. The elements of the apparatus 60, positioned at the mobile node, as well as elsewhere in the radio communication system, are functionally represented. And, such functional elements can be implemented in any desired manner. Here, the apparatus 60 formed at the mobile node includes a UMTS message generator 62 and a WLAN message generator 64. The UMTS message generator operates to generate a registration message, such as a location update message for communication to the first portion 16 of the network part of the radio communication system. The message generated by the message generator 62 includes the IP address of a home agent, here designated at 66, associated with the mobile node. The message is otherwise generated at times, and in manners, set forth in the operating standard of the GSM/GPRS operating specification, or other UMTS system. And, the WLAN message generator 64 operates to generate a message for communication to the second portion 42 of the network part of the communication system. The message generated by the generator 64 includes the IP address of the home agent 66 and forms, for example, an attach message formatted pursuant to the IEEE 802.11, or other appropriate, operating protocol.",
        "The first portion 16 of the network part of the radio communication system includes further apparatus 60 of an embodiment of the present invention. Here, again, the elements of the apparatus 60 are functionally represented and can be implemented in any desired manner. Additionally, the elements of the apparatus embodied at the first portion 16 are here shown to be distributed throughout the first portion 16. In other implementations, the elements of the apparatus embodied at the first portion 16 are physically embodied at other locations at the first portion 16, or elsewhere in the network part of the radio communication system.",
        "Here, the first portion 16 includes a UMTS message detector 72, formed at the SGSN 24. The detector 72 operates to detect the value of the home agent IP address contained in the UMTS message generated by the generator 62 embodied at the mobile node. The value of the address, detected by the detector is provided by the SGSN to the home location register 32. The home location register includes a table 74 that also forms a portion of the apparatus 60 of an embodiment of the present invention. The table includes a field 76 populated with a value of the IP address of the home agent indexed together with the identity of the mobile node, here an IMSI value 78 of the mobile node. Other fields 80, regularly contained at the HLR, are also shown to form portions of the table 74. The GGSN 22 includes a message generator 82 that also forms a portion of the apparatus 60 of an embodiment of the present invention. The message generator 82 operates a registration message for communication to the home agent 66. The address of the home agent to which the message generated by the message generator is directed is retrieved from the table 74 contained at the HLR.",
        "The second portion 42 of the network part of the radio communication system also includes apparatus 60 of a further embodiment of the present invention. Here, again, the elements of the apparatus are functionally represented and can be implemented in any desired manner. In the exemplary implementation, the functional elements of the apparatus 60 formed at the second portion 42 of the network part are embodied at an access point 52. In other implementations, the elements of the apparatus 60 can be embodied elsewhere. The apparatus 60 includes a detector 92 operable to detect the home agent IP address contained in the message generated by the WLAN message generator 64 embodied at the mobile node. The apparatus further includes a table 94 at which the identity of the home agent associated with the mobile node is indexed together with the identity of the mobile node. And, the apparatus includes a generator 96, operable to generate a registration message for communication to the home agent 66 identified in the table 94 to be associated with the mobile node. Upon generation of the messages by either the message generator 62 or 64, the mobile node can be placed in a dormant mode. Subsequent registration procedures are performed by apparatus 60 at a respective portion 16 or 42 of the network part of the communication system. Support for roaming operations and inter technology operation is thereby provided.",
        "FIG. 2 illustrates functional representations of various of the elements of the radio communication system 10 shown in FIG. 1. The GGSN 22, SGSN 24, and HLR 32 of the first network portion of the radio communication system are also shown in the figure. And, the access point 52, access router 46, and PMAP 48 of the second portion of the network part also are shown in the figure. Operation of the apparatus 60 embodied at the second network portion by which to register the mobile node 12 with the home agent 66 is represented in the figure.",
        "When the mobile node 12 roams into an area encompassed by the WLAN, i.e., the area encompassed by an access point 52 of the second portion of the network part of the communication system, the mobile node detects the availability of communications by way of the WLAN through detection of beacon signals generated by the access points of the WLAN. The mobile node associates with the access point 52 by generating the message by the WLAN message generator 64 (shown in FIG. 1). The attachment message is indicated in the figure by the arrow 102. The mobile node also informs the access point that the mobile node shall be in a power-save mode, i.e., a dormant mode. Then, the mobile node enters the dormant mode. Thereafter, the access point, and the apparatus 60 embodied thereat, is responsible for effectuating various actions. Namely, the access point operates to send an MIPv 4 registration request message to the home agent. Generate of the message indicated in the figure by the segment 104. The access point also operates to receive an MIPv 4 registration reply message generated by the home agent. Such message is indicated in the figure by the segment 106. The access point also operates to generate and send a paging cache binding message to a mobility anchor point, referred to herein as the Paging Mobility Anchor Point (PMAP) 48. And, the access point also operates to receive a paging cache binding reply message generated by the PMAP. Generation of such message is indicated by the segment 108.",
        "By providing the access point with the apparatus 60 of an embodiment of the present invention, responsibility is given to the access point for the MIPv 4 registration and paging binding on behalf of the mobile node. Thereby, the dormant mode operation of the mobile node is supported. The mobile node IPv 4 registration is turned-off at the mobile node terminal. And, the mobile node is responsible only pursuant to the basic WLAN procedure, i.e., to become associated with the access point 52. The association procedures set forth in the IEEE 802.11 is extended to encompass the IP address of the home agent 66. When the mobile node associates with the access point, the IP address of the home agent is inserted into the association message. The access point acts as a proxy to perform the MIPv 4 registration for the mobile node. As the proxy, the access point keeps the IP address of the mobile node at the table 94. And, the access point maps the IP address of the home agent to the IP address of the mobile node, as indicated in the table, to permit the mobile IP registration to be performed on behalf of the mobile node. In the event of an unsuccessful attempt to locate the mobile node, the access point informs the home agent. Unsuccessful attempts to locate the mobile node may occur, e.g., when data arrives while the mobile node is roaming but there is not enough time for the UMTS to register the mobile node with the home agent.",
        "FIG. 3 also illustrates various elements of the first and second portions of the network part of the radio communication system. Here, operation of the apparatus 60 embodied at the first portion of the network part is represented. Elements shown in the figure are commonly-referenced with the elements shown previously, and described with respect to FIG. 1.",
        "When the mobile node roams from the WLAN into the UMTS, the mobile node is not required to become disassociated with the access point 52 of the WLAN. When the mobile node roams into the UMTS, the mobile node performs a location update with the SGSN 24. The location update is a GPRS attach procedure. Pursuant to the location update, a message generated by the message generator 62 (shown in FIG. 1) is generated. Communication of the message is indicated in the figure by the segment 122. Responsive thereto, the SGSN activates the location information and a Mobile Mobility (MM) context in the home location register. The MM context is a flag maintained at the HLR defined in the specification associated with GPRS. Upon generation of the location update message, the mobile node enters the dormant mode. A GTP tunnel, conventionally required to be formed between the SGSN and GGSN designated in the figure by segment 124, is obviated. And, the mobile node does not perform MTPv 4 registration procedures. Instead, the home location register generates the MM activation of the mobile node 12 with the GGSN. Such activation is indicated in the figure by the segment 128. Then, the GGSN, here forming an MIPv 4 registration proxy, registers the mobile node with the home agent. The MIPv4 registration request message is indicated in the figure by the segment 132. And, the GGSN also receives the MIPv 4 registration request and reply handshake, indicated in the figure by the segment 136.",
        "By giving the responsibility to the GGSN to perform the MIPv 4 registration on behalf of the mobile node, dormant mode operation of the mobile node is supported. And, the mobile Ipv 4 registration is turned off at the mobile node. The mobile node is responsive merely for the basic UMTS location registration with the SGSN and the SGSN with the HLR. In order to support roaming to the WLAN, the UMTS location registration is extended to cover the home agent IP address. When the mobile node updates its location with the SGSN the mobile node inserts the home agent IP address into the location update message. And, the SGSN forwards the IP address of the home agent to the HLR. The HLR maps the IP address of the home agent to the IP address of each mobile node, indicated by field 76 and 80 of the table 74.",
        "When the mobile node is operated pursuant to the UMTS, a GPRS attach procedure is made to the SGSN when the mobile node is turned on in the GPRS mode. The mobile node provides its identity, i.e., the IMSI, and the attach type. The GPRS attach procedure forms, essentially, establishment of a Logical Link Control (LLC) layer between the mobile node and the SGSN. The LLC connection between the mobile node and the SGSN is an IMSI-base connection.",
        "FIG. 4 illustrates a method, shown generally at 142, of an embodiment of the present invention. The method facilitates sufficient delivery of identifying indicia to a home agent associated with the mobile node.",
        "First, and as indicated by the block 144, a mobile node generated message is detected at the network of a radio communication system. The mobile node generated message is generated pursuant to a mobile node selected when of a first and second operating protocols. And, the message includes an identifier, identifying the identifying indicia of the mobile node.",
        "Then, and as indicated by the block 146, the identifying indicia is delivered to the home agent associated with mobile node. The delivery of the identifying indicia is effectuated free of further interaction by the mobile node, thereby permitting the mobile node to be in the dormant mode during delivery of the identifying indicia to the home agent.",
        "Thereby, manner is provided by which to support roaming operations of a mobile node operable in a UMTS and a WLAN, or other set, of operating systems.",
