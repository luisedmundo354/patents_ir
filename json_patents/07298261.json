        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The invention relates to a proximity sensor adopted in applications of determining the presence or absence of a metal body and measuring a distance of the metal body therefrom using a change in oscillation amplitude of an oscillation circuit including a coil.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "There have been available proximity sensors of this kind in each of which a range (detection range) over which a metal body as a detection object (hereinafter referred to as \u201cbody\u201d) can be detected is variably set by an adjustment operation of a user. As a typical example, a variable resistor is incorporated in an oscillation circuit and a rotational operation is conducted on the variable resistor to thereby change a current flowing in a feedback circuit of the oscillation circuit.",
        "In Japanese Patent Publication No. 3440566, a proximity sensor with the construction is presented as a conventional example and, besides, a proposal is made on a sensor of a type with improvement in the construction. The sensor of an improved type includes: a sensitivity adjustment circuit having plural series circuits constituted of a resistor and a switch, wherein change-over between combinations of resistors used in sensitivity adjustment is conducted by control with a microcomputer to thereby control a feedback current quantity supplied to a resonance circuit (see FIG. 1 of Japanese Patent Publication No. 3440566). Besides, in the publication, another proximity sensor is also disclosed in which change-over is conducted between resistors in a current mirror circuit determining a feedback current to thereby control a feedback current quantity (see FIG. 15 of Japanese Patent Publication No. 3440566).",
        "Since a relationship between a rotational quantity of a variable resistor and a detection distance is nonlinear in a case where a magnitude of a feedback current is adjusted by a rotational quantity of a variable resistor, a state arises where difficulty is encountered grasping an operational amount necessary to acquire a desired detection distance. Hence, an operator is required repetition of an adjustment operation and confirmation of action of a sensor due to the adjustment, having led to a problem to consume labor and time in the adjustment.",
        "In a proximity sensor of a type adjustment operation of which a user conducts, properness of the adjustment is judged by the intuition or experience of the operator and there is not shown any of indexes each of which is used for determining whether or not an adjusted oscillation amplitude has a sensitivity suitable for detection of a body.",
        "In a case where proximity sensors with the same performance are arranged and the same detection distance can be commonly set to the sensors, sensitivities of the sensors are desirably made uniform. Since a conventional sensor adjustment of which is conducted with a variable resistor is provided with no contrivance enabling an operational quantity to be correctly grasped and there is possibility of causing a variance in the adjustment even by a slight hand movement, difficulty is encountered conducting uniform adjustment. Even if one expert conducts the adjustment in the sensors, it is difficult to avoid generation of a variance in sensitivity over the sensors due to the same reason.",
        "On the other hand, according to a proximity sensor disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 3440566, since a combination of resistors is determined by a microcomputer, many of resistors provided enable proper sensitive adjustment to be implemented depending on a detection distance desired to be set. If many of resistors are provided, the number of parts increases, resulting in a problem of a up-sizing of the equipment and increase in cost. Even this proximity sensor has no means notifying a user of how a sensitivity is set.",
        "The invention has been made while attention is directed to the problem, and it is a first object of the invention to enable fine adjustment of a sensitivity to be achieved with a small number of parts by adjusting a magnitude of a voltage applied to a feedback circuit of an oscillation circuit by a digital control.",
        "It is a second object of the invention to raise precision in sensitivity adjustment by indicating an index for eliminating a fluctuation in set sensitivity and setting an optimal sensitivity in a case where a sensitivity is adjusted by an adjustment operation of an operator",
        "A proximity sensor related to the invention includes: an oscillation circuit having a coil; detection means detecting a metal body using an oscillation amplitude of the oscillation circuit; output means outputting a result of the detection conducted by the detection means; and adjustment means adjusting a state of a change in oscillation amplitude relative to a change in distance between the coil and the metal body.",
        "The detection means of the proximity sensor can include determination means determining the presence or absence of the object by comparison of the oscillation amplitude with a prescribed threshold value. Besides, measurement means measuring a distance from the coil to the body can also be included by collating a value of oscillation amplitude with a predetermined table. While the determination means and the measurement means can be constructed as a logic circuit including a comparator and others, they are preferably constructed using a computer in which a program matching a function of the means is stored.",

        "According to the proximity sensor with the construction, since a voltage level applied to a feedback circuit of the oscillation circuit is set as an adjustment signal in digital quantity and thereafter, a voltage signal obtained by digital to analog converting the adjustment signal is outputted to the feedback circuit, a voltage level can be controlled in each increase or decrease in level by a unit value corresponding to resolution of the D/A conversion. Hence, even without providing many circuits in parallel as in Japanese Patent Publication No. 3440566, a current can be adjusted with increase or decrease by a small unit, thereby enabling fine adjustment of sensitivity to be achieved.",
        "A preferred embodiment of a proximity sensor includes: an operation section for sensitivity adjustment; and a display section for displaying information showing information indicating a value of the adjustment signal or information indicating a magnitude of an oscillation amplitude.

Besides, the proximity sensor includes display control means controlling a display on the display section using an oscillation amplitude when a value of the adjustment signal set by the signal generation means or a signal after digital to analog conversion of the adjustment signal is outputted to the feedback circuit.",

The operation section can be of a push button type switches or keys for inputting numbers, while no specific limitation is placed thereon and the section may be constructed with levers or volumes. The operation section may be constructed so that a value of the adjustment signal itself is inputted, while no specific limitation is placed thereon and information indicating a value of the adjustment signal may be inputted indirectly. For example, a value of the adjustment signal is divided into plural levels and an operation can be conducted so as to select one of the levels.",
        "The display section can be a numerical value display unit displaying an adjustment signal and an oscillation amplitude as are. The display section can also be designed so as to display graphs such as a bar graph, a circle graph and others, and symbols indicating levels of numerical values. In a case where a graph is displayed, a scale for reading a numerical value is attached to the graph so as to enable the reading to be conducted with precision.",
        "The signal generation means can set a value of an adjustment signal according to the number of operations of a button switch or a rotational quantity of a volume to give the value or the quantity to the signal output means. The display control means can use a value of the adjustment signal or a value of an oscillation amplitude measured immediately after the value of the adjustment signal is given to the signal output means to generate display information suitable for specifications of the display section and to output the information to the display section. Note that the display control means is also desirably constructed with a computer.",
        "With the construction adopted, when an operator conducts an operation for sensitivity adjustment, an applied voltage to the feedback circuit changes following the operation to thereby adjust an oscillation amplitude. If, in this situation, a value of the adjustment signal or a value of an oscillation amplitude suitable for adjustment is shown to the operator in advance, the operator conducts an adjustment operation so as to display the information indicating the presented value on the display section, thereby enabling proper sensitivity to be set. In a case where the same detection distance is set to plural proximity sensors with the same performance as well, an adjustment operation is conducted based on a display on the display section, thereby enabling the sensors to be uniformly set in sensitivity. Note that, on the display section, there can be displayed information indicating the value of an adjustment signal and the magnitude of an oscillation information both in parallel. Both can also be displayed alternately.",
        "Then, in another preferred embodiment related to the first proximity sensor, the adjustment means includes: control means causing the signal generating means to repetitively conduct processing changing a value of the adjustment signal stepwise with increase or decrease by a prescribed unit at a time till an oscillation amplitude reaches a prescribed value; and registration means registering a value of the adjustment signal when the oscillation amplitude reaches the prescribed value.",
        "In the above description, the term \u201ca prescribed value\u201d of an oscillation amplitude is a threshold value set in advance for determination of the presence or absence of a body or a value that can be set according to an oscillation amplitude when oscillation enters a saturated state. This setting can be conducted so as to be adapted for a characteristic of an oscillation circuit in use and an application of the sensor.",
        "For example, in a case where an oscillation circuit of a hard oscillation type having a limited range in which a change in oscillation amplitude occurs is used and the circuit detects the presence or absence of a body, a value lower than the threshold value by a sufficient margin can be set to a prescribed value. In a case where an oscillation circuit having a characteristic gradually changing an oscillation amplitude is adopted, and a distance from the coil of the body within the detection distance is measured, a value lower than a saturated level can be adopted as a prescribed value. The prescribed value in this case is desirably at a level of an oscillation amplitude (a level obtained at a position corresponding to the detection distance) in a case where, even if a detection distance takes any value, a sufficient change in amplitude occurs while a body moves in the prescribed range with a position corresponding to the detection distance as a center of the range.",
        "In the above embodiment, the registration means can include a memory for storing adjustment values for an object to be registered.",
        "According to this embodiment, when an operator disposes an object to be detected at a prescribed position, an oscillating amplitude can be measured while a value of a feedback current is automatically changed by repetitive operations by the signal generation means. When the oscillation amplitude measured here assumes a state where the body can be detected with good precision, a value of the adjustment signal at the time point can be registered as a proper one. Thereafter, since a quantity of a feedback current can be adjusted by the registered adjustment signal, the presence or absence of the body and measurement of a distance can be conducted with a precision.",
        "The first proximity sensor includes: temperature measurement means (temperature sensor or the like) for measuring an environmental temperature; and the signal generation means of the adjustment means can include correction means correcting a value of the adjustment signal based on a value measured by the temperature measurement means. With this construction adopted, even if an environmental temperature changes after a proper sensitivity is set, a value of the adjustment signal can be corrected following the change; thereby enabling a proximity sensor resistant to a change in temperature to be provided. In a second proximity sensor related to the invention, the oscillation circuit includes: a feedback circuit designed so as to change a quantity of a feedback current according to an applied voltage; an operation section for setting a value of a voltage applied to the feedback circuit; and a display section displaying information indicating a set value of the voltage or information indicating an oscillation amplitude. The adjustment means is constructed so as to apply a voltage changing according to the setting in the operation section to the feedback circuit in the oscillation circuit.",

        "The adjustment means can be equipped with signal generation means and signal output means similar to those in the first proximity sensor. The adjustment means related to the second proximity is not limited to digital control and can include a way of controlling an applied voltage by adjusting a resistance value related to the feedback circuit (an embodiment that the variable resistors are incorporated and an embodiment that plural resistors are changed over therebetween).",
        "According to the second proximity sensor, when an operator conducts a setting operation on a voltage value, information on a set value of the voltage or a magnitude of an oscillation amplitude is displayed. Hence, by conducting a setting operation till prescribed information is displayed on the display section, a sensitivity suitable for a detection distance is set based on the detection distance. It is possible to eliminate a variance in sensitivity between or among sensors in a case where the same detection distance is set to the sensors with the same performance, thereby enabling higher measurement precision to be achieved.",
        "In the second proximity sensor, a numerical value display section displaying a numerical value corresponding to a voltage set by the operation section or to an oscillation amplitude of an oscillation circuit to which the voltage is applied can be used as the display section. Note that, in a case where a numerical value corresponding to the applied voltage is displayed, the displayed value is not limited to a value of the applied voltage as is and can also be a voltage value after correction obtained by adding an off-set value, or multiplying with a prescribed coefficient. The displayed value can be also a reciprocal of the voltage value or a value specifically obtained by substituting the voltage value into a prescribed equation. In the second proximity sensor as well, analog display can be presented using a graph, a bar code or the like instead of a numerical value.",
        "In a proximity sensor related to the invention, the adjustment means can include voltage control means controlling an applied voltage to the feedback circuit after setting of the voltage by the operation section. The voltage control means changes an applied voltage for setting an oscillation amplitude with a magnitude not reacting with the metal body according to a signal from outside to a value larger than a voltage to be normally set, and further adjusts the applied voltage so as to take a value to be normally set when a prescribed time elapses after the change.",
        "The embodiment described above can be applied to a case where the sensors are activated intermittently in order to prevent mutual interference between or among the sensors in the state where plural proximity sensors are arranged near each other or one another. A signal from outside can be inputted from external equipment controlling the intermittent operation. On the other hand, without using external equipment, the plural proximity sensors mutually communicate with each other or one another, thereby enabling the intermittent operation to be controlled. In this case, a transmission signal from the other sensor can be regarded as the signal from outside. For example, if a state where oscillation occurs with a magnitude thereof reactable with a metal body is considered to be \u201can operating state,\u201d when change-over is conducted from a non-operating state to an operating state or when change-over is conducted from an operating state to a non-operating state, a signal indicating the change-over can be transmitted to the other sensors.",
        "In a case where a signal from outside has any form, the feedback circuit of each proximity sensor, when another sensor is in an operating state, takes a state where the feedback circuit has been applied with a voltage generating an oscillation amplitude with a magnitude non-reactable with the metal body (an amplitude near 0 is desired) occurs or state where the feedback circuit has been absolutely applied with no voltage. When a feedback circuit assumes a state of being operable by a change in external signal, an applied voltage changes to a voltage larger than a voltage set in the previous sensitivity adjustment. The voltage, when a prescribed time elapses, changes to a voltage set in the sensitivity adjustment.",
        "According to the above embodiment, since a large voltage is temporarily applied to the feedback circuit immediately after change-over from a non-operating state to an operating state, an oscillation amplitude can be larger immediately after input of a signal, thereby enabling a time required till an oscillation amplitude thereafter is stabilized to be shortened. Therefore, there can be provided a proximity sensor a response speed of which is fast and that is resistant to noise in a rise time.",
        "According to the invention, since a magnitude of a voltage applied to a feedback circuit of an oscillation circuit is adjusted by digital control and a current matching a magnitude of the applied voltage is fed back in the feedback circuit to thereby control an oscillation state, not only can the number of parts be reduced, but a feedback current can also be finely adjusted. Therefore, a sensitivity can be finely adjusted according to a characteristic of the oscillation circuit and a detection distance.",
        "In the invention, since, in a case where a sensitivity is adjusted by an operation of an operator, the operator can conduct an adjustment operation while recognizing a magnitude of voltage applied to the feedback circuit or a magnitude of an oscillation amplitude to be adjusted by the voltage, an operation for adjusting a sensitivity to properness can be implemented. In a case where the same detection distance is set to sensors with the same performance, as well, an operator conducts an operation while recognizing the contents of a display; thereby enabling a variance in sensitivity between or among the sensors to be eliminated with the result of measurement high in precision.",

The collector of the other transistor Q31 is connected not only to the resonance circuit 11, but also a connection line on the emitter side is branched in two ways and one of the branches is connected to the capacitor C5 of the signal detection circuit 12 through a resistor R33, while the other thereof is connected to the voltage adjustment circuit 26 through a resistor R34.",
        "In this example, a current flows from the resonance circuit 11 in a direction toward the voltage adjustment circuit 26 through the transistor Q31. That is, when an oscillation amplitude is on the negative side, a current is pulled from the resonance circuit 11 by the transistor Q31, therefore an oscillation amplitude grows on the negative side to supply energy to the resonance circuit 11. A feedback current in this case is determined by a difference in voltage between the emitter of the transistor Q31 and an output of the voltage adjustment circuit 26.",
        "Of the five example oscillation circuits 10, the oscillation circuit 10 with the construction of FIG. 4 or 5 generates a large change in oscillation amplitude while a body moves between a position spaced apart from the coil by a prescribed distance (temporarily referred to point A) and another point further spaced, in the rearward direction, apart from the coil (temporarily referred to point B), while no oscillation occurs at a position in the forward direction from the point A and oscillation is saturated at a position in the rearward direction from the point B. Such an oscillation state is referred to a \u201chard oscillation.\u201d",
        "On the other hand, with the oscillation circuit 10 with the configuration of one of FIGS. 6 to 8, an oscillation amplitude changes gradually, depending on a distance between the body and the coil before oscillation amplitude does not reach a level. Such an oscillation state is referred to a \u201csoft oscillation.\u201d In a case where any of both constructions are adopted, the on/off signal can be placed in an on state, when oscillation transitions to a state where an oscillation amplitude is smaller than a prescribed threshold value from a state where an oscillation amplitude is larger than the prescribed threshold value. In a case where a distance of a body is required to be measured, a soft oscillation type oscillation circuit 10 is adopted. In this case, a table prepared from characteristic curves shown in FIG. 9(1) is stored in a memory and a distance can be obtained by collating a characteristic curve adapted for a set sensitivity with measured values of oscillation amplitude.",
        "According to the oscillation circuit 10 with any of the constructions shown in FIGS. 4 to 8, a feedback current to the resonance circuit 11 can be adjusted by changing sensitivity adjustment signal from the D/A converter 25. Since a sensitive adjustment signal is in essence an 8 bit digital signal indicating a sensitivity adjustment value, a voltage applied to the feedback circuit 13 can be changed by a prescribed unit at each time by changing a sensitivity adjustment value by 1 at a time. Hence, adjustment of sensitivity can be implemented in a finer and simpler way as compared with a case where sensitivity adjustment is conducted with change-over between resistors.",
        "FIG. 9(1) is a graph showing a relationship between a distance from a coil to a body and an oscillation amplitude and the graph shows that a relationship therebetween changes according to the sensitivity adjustment value. Note that curves shown on the graph (hereinafter referred to as \u201ccharacteristic curves\u201d) are obtained in a case where the soft oscillation type oscillation circuit 10 of one of FIGS. 6 to 8 is employed. A distance on the abscissa is a normalized one of an actual distance of the body obtained by giving a detection distance as a rating (a detection distance guaranteed by a maker as detectable) a numerical value of 100%.",
        "In the graph, a characteristic curve P0 shows a relationship at a sensitivity adjustment value of 0 and a characteristic curve P255 shows a relationship at the maximum adjustment value of 255. Characteristic curves at other sensitivity adjustment values are arranged along a direction from the curve P0 to the curve P255 (along a direction shown by an arrow symbol F in the figure) in the ascending order by sensitivity adjustment value.",
        "According to the graph, in the range of a detection distance as a rating, an oscillation amplitude grows with increase in sensitivity adjustment value. Since an oscillation amplitude is saturated under an influence of internal voltage in the circuit, a sensitivity is, to the contrary, reduced as an oscillation amplitude approaches a saturated state by increase in sensitivity adjustment value, however.",
        "For example, in the graph of FIG. 9(1), in a case where a distance of a body is measured in a range of from the point A to the point B on the distance axis, a measurement precision can be raised with a larger change in oscillation amplitude relative to a distance (which is shown as a slope of a triangle in each curve as a model) between the points A and B. That is, a slope of each curve can be obtained as a parameter indicating a sensitivity.",
        "FIG. 9(2) is a graph obtained by plotting sensitivity values of the curves relative to oscillation amplitudes around the point A. As shown in the graph, as an oscillation amplitude increases, a sensitivity increase till an oscillation amplitude reaches to a value D, whereas as an oscillation amplitude further increases beyond the value D and approaches a saturated state, a sensitivity decreases. A characteristic curve corresponding to a sensitivity peak varies according to a detection distance. Hence, by obtaining a characteristic curve corresponding to a sensitivity peak for each detection distance, detection processing for a body is placed in the best state in terms of precision.",
        "FIG. 10 shows other characteristic curves in a case where a hard oscillation type oscillation circuit 10 shown in one of FIGS. 3 and 4 is employed. Note that in this figure as well, a characteristic curve is indicated by P0 at a sensitivity adjustment value of 0 and a characteristic curve is indicated by P255 at an adjustment value of 255. Characteristic curves at other sensitivity adjustment values are arranged between P0 and P255.",
        "In a case of the oscillation circuit 10 of this kind, while any curve has a similar slop of a change in oscillation amplitude, a range in which the change occurs moves forward with increase insensitivity adjustment value. Hence, a user obtains in advance a characteristic curve Px such that a position of a body to be desired to be detected by the user (a point C in the figure) is included in the range of a change in oscillation amplitude, and a sensitivity adjustment value corresponding to the curve Px is set, thereby enabling the body to be stably detected.",
        "An oscillation amplitude of the oscillation circuit 10 has, as shown in FIG. 15 described later, a possibility of a change therein due to an external factor such as a change in temperature. Hence, in a case where the oscillation circuit 10 having a characteristic as shown in FIG. 10, if a distance to the point C from the coil is more than a detection distance of a rating, the action becomes unstable and a possibility arises that a body cannot be detected correctly. Therefore, the point C is necessary to be set at a point in a forward direction shorter than the detection distance of a rating.",
        "In a case where the hard oscillation type oscillation circuit 10 is employed in the proximity sensor with one of the constructions of FIGS. 1 to 3, a sensitivity is, in light of the above point, adjusted by a procedure that a user conducts as shown in FIG. 11 described below. Note that in FIGS. 11 and 12, a step is abbreviated as ST in description. In the description presented below, ST is used instead of a step in conformity with the above abbreviation.",
        "The procedure is started after the head section 1 of a proximity sensor is located at a prescribed position. First of all, in a first ST1, a body that is a detection object is disposed at a position spaced apart from the head section 1 by a prescribed distance. In ST2, a sensitivity adjustment value is set to an initial value of 0 in response to operations such as selection of a sensitivity adjustment mode from the menu of set modes.",
        "In such a situation, a sensitivity adjustment value is increased till an output from the sensor reaches an on state (a state where the \u201cpresence of a body\u201d is determined) (ST3 and 4). When in on state, a sensitivity adjustment value displayed on the display section 21 is checked at the time point. If the numerical value displayed here is less than a prescribed lower limit value T1, a sensitivity adjustment value is determined as \u201cNO\u201d in ST5, and in ST7, a processing is conducted that moves the body toward the head section 1. If the numerical value displayed here is more than a prescribed upper limit value T2, a sensitivity adjustment value is determined as \u201cNO\u201d in ST6, and in ST8, a processing is conducted that moves the body away from the head section 1.",
        "After the processing moving the body toward the head section 1 or away from the head section 1 is executed, the process returns back to ST2 and a resetting operation and others are conducted to thereby reset a sensitivity adjustment value. A sensitivity adjustment value when an on output is obtained is confirmed while a sensitivity adjustment value is gradually increased in a similar manner to that as described above.",
        "If a sensitivity adjustment value when an on output is given takes a value between the lower limit value T1 and the upper limit value T2 at a prescribed time point, determinations in ST5 and ST6 are both \u201cYES,\u201d completing the adjustment operation.",
        "According to the above procedure, a user disposes a body at a position spaced away from the head section 1 by a desired distance and conducts sensitivity adjustment till the on/off signal transitions from an off state to an on state. In the course of operation, by setting a sensitivity of a characteristic curve corresponding to the detection distance of a rating to the lower limit T1, a necessity arises for the body to move in a forward direction since an on state of an output is obtained at a sensitivity adjustment value less than the T1 in a case where a current position of the body is farther than the detection distance of a rating. Therefore, a detection distance capable of stably detecting the body can be determined and at the same time, a sensitivity suitable for the detection distance can be set. Note that the upper limit value T2 has only to be set to a value suitable for the purpose of a user and may be the maximum of 255.",
        "Then, in a case where the soft oscillation type oscillation circuit 10 is employed in order to measure a distance of a body, generally, the maximum distance that a user desires to measure is set as a detection distance; therefore, a sensitivity is desirably adjusted while the detection distance is maintained. In a case where a change in oscillation amplitude in the vicinity of a set detection distance is small or an oscillation amplitude is close to be in a saturated state, precision of detection becomes unstable; therefore it is necessary to select a sensitivity adjustment value so as to enable a sensitivity suitable for the detection distance (a sensitivity in the vicinity of a peak of FIG. 9(2)) to be obtained.",
        "A general user, however, is not familiar with a characteristic of oscillation as shown in FIG. 9. Especially in a case where a user conducts sensitivity adjustment for the first time, the user has a high possibility of absolutely no grasping a sensitivity adjustment value suitable for a detection distance. Hence, a necessity arises for some help to be offered in adjustment operation with an index to be used instead of a sensitivity adjustment value.",
        "In a case where the soft oscillation type oscillation circuit 10 is, after consideration of the above problem, adopted in the proximity sensor with one of the constructions of FIGS. 1 to 3, an output value from the A/D converter 24, that is a value of an oscillation amplitude, is displayed on the display section 21. A procedure in adjustment operation is implemented in a flow as shown in FIG. 12.",
        "In the procedure of FIG. 12, as well, a user conducts an initial setting of a sensitivity adjustment value to 0 after the user disposes a body at a position corresponding to a distance desired to be set by him or her (ST1 and 12). Thereafter, a sensitivity adjustment value is set so as to increase till indication of an oscillation amplitude reaches a prescribed value D (ST13 and 14). Note that a value of the D is necessary to be more than a threshold value for determination on the presence or absence of a body and less than an oscillation amplitude in a saturated state. If an oscillation amplitude at a position corresponding to a detection distance, which may be any value is taken, is the D, necessity arises for an oscillation amplitude to show a large change over positions before and after the body. In light of such a point and an oscillation state at each sensitivity adjustment value, it is desirable to set a value of about 70% of the oscillation amplitude in a saturated state as D.",
        "According to the procedure, since the user can set a sensitivity adjustment value so that an oscillation amplitude takes a state suitable for detection, the user can set a good sensitivity, regardless of a detection distance set by the user.",
        "According to the procedures shown in FIGS. 11 and 12, an adjustment operation can be conducted while an index for adjustment is displayed on the display section 21. Therefore, in a case where plural sensors with the same performance are used in similar conditions, as well, a setting is performed on one sensor according to the procedure and thereafter, the rest of sensors are adjusted so as to present the same value as that presented at the end point of adjustment for the first sensor, thereby enabling a variance in sensitivity over the sensors to be eliminated with the result of measurement with good precision. Note that, in a case of soft oscillation type proximity sensors, if a sensitivity setting is performed on a first sensor according to the procedure of FIG. 12 and thereafter, a display is changed over to a sensitivity adjustment value, similar setting can be performed on the rest of sensors with a sensitivity adjustment value as an index.",
        "The procedures of FIGS. 11 and 12 are both executed by a user, while, instead thereof, CPU 20 may adjust a magnitude of an oscillation amplitude by updating a sensitivity adjustment value with one increase in the value at a time. In this case, the hard oscillation type oscillation circuit 10, when being used, has only to perform updating of a sensitivity adjustment value till an oscillation amplitude reaches a threshold value for detection of a body. On the other hand, the soft oscillation type oscillation circuit 10, when being used, has only to perform updating of a sensitivity adjustment value till an oscillation amplitude reaches a value of the D.",
        "In a case of the hard oscillation type oscillation circuit 10, if a sensitivity adjustment value when an oscillation amplitude reaches the threshold value becomes less than the lower limit value T1, it is desirable to display an error code on the display section 20 to thereby inform the fact to the user.",
        "According to the construction shown in FIG. 1, since the preamplification section 3 together with the head section 1 constitutes the detection section, the amplification section 2 is necessary to be provided to each head section 1, while the amplification section 2 can be common to plural kinds of head sections. In this case, the amplification section 2 can set optimal sensitivities adapted for the characteristics of respective head sections 1.",
        "FIG. 13(1) exemplifies three head sections 1 (which are indicated with head A, head B and head C for convenience in description) having different relationships between an oscillation amplitude and a distance. FIG. 13(2) shows a result of adjustment by means of a conventional method in which a resistance value is changed for each of characteristic curves of FIG. 13(1), and FIG. 13(3) shows a result of adjustment with a sensitivity adjustment value of this example applied on the characteristic curves.",
        "In a case of adjustment by changing-over between variable resistors for sensitivity adjustment, a user has had difficulty grasping a proper operation quantity of a volume. As a result, changes in oscillation altitude after the adjustment, as shown in FIG. 13(2), are different in the respective head sections 1, having led to a problem of large variance in set sensitivity among the sections.",
        "In contrast to this, a proximity sensor of this example, as described above, can adjust a sensitivity adjustment value while displaying a numerical value indicating an oscillation amplitude. Hence, by adjusting a sensitivity adjustment value on each of the head sections so as to reduce a difference in oscillation amplitude between or among the head sections, a variance in sensitivity over the head sections can be less.",
        "According to a proximity sensor with the construction of FIG. 3, since a value of a feedback current can be determined by CPU 20, more detailed control can be conducted so as to match an installment environment of a sensor or the purpose of use of a sensor.",
        "FIG. 14 shows a configuration capable of controlling an oscillation amplitude depending on a change in environmental temperature of a sensor. Since a main part of the configuration of FIG. 14 is similar to that shown in FIG. 3, the same symbols as in FIG. 3 are attached and detailed description thereof is omitted.",
        "The example of FIG. 14 includes: temperature sensors 61 and 62 provided to the head section 1 (not shown here) and the amplification section 2, respectively, and the amplification section 2 includes: an input section 29 for inputting measured values by the temperature sensors 61 and 62 to CPU 20. A memory attached to CPU 20 has a correction table, incorporated in the memory, for correcting a sensitivity adjustment value based on a temperature. In the correction table, temperature values are classified into plural sections and correction values for a sensitivity adjustment value are related to the respective sections thereof.",
        "A temperature sensor may be provided to one of the head section land the amplification section 2. Especially, in a case where the head section 1 is located in a place in which a change in temperature is large, it is desirable to provide a temperature sensor on the head section 1 side.",
        "FIGS. 15(1) and 15(2) show a principle in correction using temperature information based on a relationship between a distance and an oscillation amplitude at environmental temperatures of 25, 60 and \u221210 degrees.",
        "FIG. 15(1) is characteristic curves before correction related to temperatures. From the curves, it is found that as an environmental temperature is raised, an oscillation amplitude increases, while as an environmental temperature is lowered, an oscillation amplitude decreases.",
        "FIG. 15(2) shows an example in which correction is conducted so that a characteristic curves at 60 degrees and a characteristic curves at \u221210 degrees match characteristic curves at 25 degrees",
        "CPU 20 corrects a sensitivity adjustment value inputted from the operation section 22 based on a measured value of a temperature under the above principle and outputs a value after the correction as a sensitivity adjustment signal. Note that a correction value necessary for the correction is read from the correction table of the memory.",
        "For example, a prescribed temperature (for example 25 degrees) is set as an ordinarily temperature in advance and when temperatures detected by the temperature sensors 61 and 62 are higher than the ordinary temperature, a sensitivity adjustment value is corrected to a value less than an input value to thereby reduce an oscillation amplitude. When temperatures detected by the temperature sensors 61 and 62 are lower than the ordinary temperature to the contrary, a sensitivity adjustment value is corrected to a value more than an input value to thereby increase an oscillation amplitude.",
        "FIGS. 16(1) to 16(3) shows an example in which the sensitivity adjustment signal is used for control in a case where plural proximity sensors are used in the vicinity with each other or one another.",
        "In a case where plural proximity sensors are disposed close to each other or one another, the sensors have been conventionally changed over therebetween and controlled so as to be alternately oscillated in order to prevent a mutual interference between or among sensors. FIG. 16(1) is an concrete example and three sensors A, B and C are in a regular order oscillated for the same time length. Note that change-over between oscillation of sensors can be controlled by a control signal from external host equipment or by mutual communication between sensors.",
        "With the control applied, one sensor can perform a processing for detecting a body without receiving an influence from an action of another sensor.",
        "In a conventional control, however, since no signal with a sufficient magnitude is outputted at a leading edge of oscillation, as shown in FIG. 16(2), it takes along time T till the oscillation is stabilized, providing a possibility to receive an influence of a noise during the time T.",
        "Contrast to this, in the proximity sensor with the configuration of FIG. 3, a sensitivity adjustment signal at the leading edge of oscillation is, as shown in FIG. 16(3), rendered more than an essential set value and thereafter, control is executed such that the sensitivity adjustment signal is restored to the essential value. With such a configuration adopted, the time T till oscillation is stabilized can be greatly reduced, thereby enabling stable detection to be realized.",
        "The above description has presented with a proximity sensor of a type detecting an oscillation amplitude as an example, while the invention can be applied to a frequency detection type proximity sensor. In FIG. 17, there is shown an example application thereof.",
        "In a proximity sensor of this example, the oscillation circuit 10 is of the configuration, similar to that in FIG. 3, in which in the amplification section 2, a frequency counter 201 is disposed instead of the detection circuit 23 and the A/D converter 24. In this example, a sensitivity adjustment signal from the D/A converter 25 is increased or decreased to thereby increase or decrease a feedback quantity of a current, thereby enabling an oscillation frequency to be adjusted.",
        "In this example, as well, a sensitivity adjustment value is inputted from the operation section 22, thereby enabling a sensitivity adapted for the input value to be set. Besides, in this example, as well, a sensitivity adjustment value is adjusted till a display on the frequency counter 201 indicates a prescribed value, thereby enabling a sensitivity suitable for detection of a body to be set.",
        "FIG. 18 shows another example of oscillation detection type proximity sensor. Note that the proximity sensor of this example, as well, has a main configuration similar to that of FIG. 3, while there is shown a detailed relationship between parts of the construction and the power supply circuit 28.",
        "In the proximity sensor of this example, a volume including a variable resistor Re is incorporated as the operation section 22 instead of the construction of FIG. 2. The variable resistor Re is connected to ground potential at one end thereof, while being connected to the a positive potential V through a resistor R41 at the other end thereof. An A/D converter 202 is connected to a point on a connection line between the variable resistor Re and the resistor R41. The A/D converter 202 is connected to CPU 20 in a similar way to that of the A/D converter 24 on the detection circuit 23 side.",
        "The A/D converter 202 detects a potential between the variable resistor Re and the resistor R41. CPU 20 captures the detection potential as an operation quantity of the volume to convert the potential to a prescribed numerical value and to present the value on the display section 21. At the same time, CPU 20 outputs the numerical value outputted to the display section 21, to the D/A converter 25 as a sensitivity adjustment signal.",
        "With the configuration adopted, since a rotational quantity of the volume can be obtained as a numerical value to show clearly to a user, a variance in setting can be eliminated. A feedback current can be adjusted in prescribed units using a sensitivity adjustment signal in a digital quantity.",
        "FIG. 19 is obtained by deforming the configuration of FIG. 18 and common constituents in the configuration are attached with similar symbols to those in FIG. 18. In the proximity sensor of this example, not only is the A/D converter 24 connected to the detection circuit 23 replaced with a signal processing circuit 203, but the signal processing circuit 203 is connected directly to the output circuit 27. The signal processing circuit 203 includes a comparator, compares the detected signal with a prescribed threshold value and outputs an on/off signal indicating a result of the comparison to the output circuit 27.",
        "With the configuration adopted, the presence or absence can be determined without using CPU 20, thereby enabling a response of a proximity sensor to be faster.",
        "Note that while, in the examples, a voltage applied to the feedback circuit 13 of the oscillation circuit 10 is adjusted to thereby adjust a feedback current, a circuit or IC conducting current control may be used instead thereof to thereby adjust a feedback current of the oscillation circuit 10. In the latter case, a current quantity can be controlled according to a value of a sensitivity adjustment signal from CPU 20."
