        "The present invention relates to an improved ink-jet recording material.",
        "In the majority of applications printing proceeds by pressure contact of an ink-loaded printing form with an ink-receiving material which is usually plain paper. The most frequently used impact printing technique is known as lithographic printing based on the selective acceptance of oleophilic ink on a suitable receptor. In recent times however so-called non-impact printing systems have replaced classical pressure-contact printing to some extent for specific applications. A survey is given e.g. in the book \u201cPrinciples of Non Impact Printing\u201d by Jerome L. Johnson (1986), Palatino Press, Irvine, Calif. 92715, USA.",
        "Among non-impact printing techniques ink-jet printing has become a popular technique because of its simplicity, convenience and low cost. Especially in those instances where a limited edition of the printed matter is needed ink-jet printing has become a technology of choice. A recent survey on progress and trends in ink-jet printing technology is given by Hue P. Le in Journal of Imaging Science and Technology Vol. 42 (1), January/February 1998.",
        "In ink-jet printing tiny drops of ink fluid are projected directly onto an ink receptor surface without physical contact between the printing device and the receptor. The printing device stores the printing data electronically and controls a mechanism for ejecting the drops image-wise. Printing is accomplished by moving the print head across the paper or vice versa. Early patents on ink-jet printers include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,739,393, 3,805,273 and 3,891,121.",
        "The jetting of the ink droplets can be performed in several different ways. In a first type of process a continuous droplet stream is created by applying a pressure wave pattern. This process is known as continuous ink-jet printing. In a first embodiment the droplet stream is divided into droplets that are electrostatically charged, deflected and recollected, and into droplets that remain uncharged, continue their way undeflected, and form the image. Alternatively, the charged deflected stream forms the image and the uncharged undeflected jet is recollected. In this variant of continuous ink-jet printing several jets are deflected to a different degree and thus record the image (multideflection system). According to a second process the ink droplets can be created \u201con demand\u201d (\u201cDOD\u201d or \u201cdrop on demand\u201d method) whereby the printing device ejects the droplets only when they are used in imaging on a receiver thereby avoiding the complexity of drop charging, deflection hardware, and ink recollection. In drop-on-demand the ink droplet can be formed by means of a pressure wave created by a mechanical motion of a piezoelectric transducer (so-called \u201cpiezo method\u201d), or by means of discrete thermal pushes (so-called \u201cbubble jet\u201d method, or \u201cthermal jet\u201d method).",
        "Ink compositions for ink-jet typically include following ingredients: dyes or pigments, water and/or organic solvents, humectants such as glycols, detergents, thickeners, polymeric binders, preservatives, etc. It will be readily understood that the optimal composition of such an ink is dependent on the ink-jetting method used and on the nature of the substrate to be printed. The ink compositions can be roughly divided in:\n\n    \n    \n        water based; the drying mechanism involves absorption, penetration and evaporation;\n        oil based; the drying involves absorption and penetration;\n        solvent based; the drying mechanism involves primarely evaporation;\n        hot melt or phase change: the ink vehicle is liquid at the ejection temperature but solid at room temperature; drying is replaced by solidification;\n        UV-curable; drying is replaced by polymerization.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,686 discloses a recording sheet for use in connection with inkjet printing comprising an opaque base sheet and a surface coating on said base sheet, said surface coating comprising a polyhydroxylic polymeric binder with the hydroxyl groups in the cis position, a substantial portion of said binder having been gelled with a gelling agent selected from the group consisting of boric acid, derivatives of boric acid, and mixtures thereof, and a filler component having high absorption capacity, said binder being present in an amount of from about 10 to 100 percent by weight of the amount of said filler, whereby said filler primarily acts as the ink receptor in said ink-jet printing and the shape, size and uniformity of dots of said ink as applied to said recording sheet may be substantially improved thereby.",

        "EP 888,904 A1 discloses an ink-jet recording method comprising: recording on an ink-jet recording sheet comprising a non-water-absorbing support and provided thereon an ink absorbing layer containing polyvinyl alcohol, fine inorganic particles and boric acid or its salt, using an ink-jet recording apparatus and a water-based recording liquid containing a high boiling solvent containing a hydroxy group, wherein the following requirements (1) and (2) are met: (1) 0.05\u2266X/Y\u22660.5 and (2) Z/Y\u22664, wherein X is an amount of boric acid or its salt contained in the ink absorbing layer of the recording sheet, expressed in mmol/m; Y is an amount of a hydroxy group contained in polyvinyl alcohol contained in the ink absorbing layer of the recording sheet, expressed in mmol/m; and Z is a maximum amount of the hydroxy group contained in the high boiling solvent contained in a unit area when recorded on the recording sheet at a maximum ejecting amount of the water-based recording liquid, expressed in mmol/m2.",
        "It is known that the ink-receiving layers in ink-jet recording materials must meet different stringent requirements:\n\n    \n    \n        the ink-receiving layer should have a high ink absorbing capacity, so that the dots will not flow out and will not be expanded more than is necessary to obtain a high optical density;\n        the ink-receiving layer should have a high ink absorbing speed (short ink drying time) so that the ink droplets will not feather if smeared immediately after applying;\n        the ink dots that are applied to the ink-receiving layer should be substantially round in shape and smooth at their peripheries. The dot diameter must be constant and accurately controlled;\n        the receiving layer must be readily wetted so that there is no \u201cpuddling\u201d, i.e. coalescence of adjacent ink dots, and an earlier absorbed ink drop should not show any \u201cbleeding\u201d, i.e. overlap with neighbouring or later placed dots;\n        transparent ink-jet recording elements must have a low haze-value and be excellent in transmittance properties;\n        after being printed the image must have a good resistance regarding water-fastness, light-fastness, and good endurance under severe conditions of temperature and humidity;\n        the ink-jet recording element may not show any curl or sticky behaviour if stacked before or after being printed; and\n        the ink-jet recording element must be able to move smoothly through different types of printers.\n\nAll these properties are often in a relation of trade-off. It is difficult to satisfy them all at the same time.",
        "In order to obtain images showing high gloss, high color densities and fast drying it is desirable that the ink receiving layer has a relative high coating weight and a high pigment/binder ratio. However, such a high pigment/binder ratio tends to deteriorate the mechanical strength of the ink receiving layer, in particular when a flexible support is used, which is often visible as microcracks. It is strongly desired to find measures to avoid this cracking while retaining the other good image properties.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide an ink-jet recording material capable of providing a finished image exhibiting high gloss and high densities in the absence of cracking.",
        "Further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter.",
        "It has been surprisingly found that a finished image exhibiting high gloss and high densities in the absence of cracking can be realized by using an ink-jet recording material comprising a polymer containing a repeating monomeric unit having a moiety capable of chelating boric acid by means of at least one nitrogen containing functional group and at least one hydroxyl group thereby forming a five- or six-membered ring together with boric acid. Crosslinking of the above-mentioned polymer can be realized with crosslinking agent in the ink-jet recording material or applied to the ink-jet recording material for example with the ink-jet ink.",

Such substituents include hydroxyl groups, ether groups, carboxylic acid groups, ester groups, amide groups and amine groups.",
        "The support for use in the present invention can be chosen from paper type and polymeric type supports well-known from photographic technology. Paper types include plain paper, cast coated paper, polyethylene coated paper and polypropylene coated paper. Polymeric supports include cellulose acetate propionate or cellulose acetate butyrate, polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene naphthalate, polyamides, polycarbonates, polyimides, polyolefins, poly(vinylacetals), polyvinyl chloride, polyethers and polysulfonamides. Other examples of useful high-quality polymeric supports for the present invention include opaque white polyesters and extrusion blends of polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene. Polyester film supports and especially polyethylene terephthalate are preferred because of their excellent properties of dimensional stability. When such a polyester is used as the support material, a subbing layer may be employed to improve the bonding of the ink-receiving layer to the support. Useful subbing layers for this purpose are well known in the photographic art and include, for example, polymers of vinylidene chloride such as vinylidene chloride/acrylonitrile/acrylic acid terpolymers or vinylidene chloride/methyl acrylate/itaconic acid terpolymers.",

        "Preferably the polymer used in accordance with the present invention is a water-dispersible polymeric latex. When the polymer is water-soluble or a film-forming latex it can be advantageously used as binder for the ink receiving layer.",
        "The particular advantage of using such a polymer as binder in an ink receiving layer can be explained as follows. One way for assuring a good ink uptake is a sufficient porosity of the layer. This can be realized by means of a high ratio of amount of pigment (e.g. silica, alumina) versus binder (e.g. polyvinyl alcohol). However, such a high pigment/binder ratio tends to deteriorate the mechanical strength of the layer resulting in the occurrence of cracks and curling. Contrary to conventional binders the polymers used in the present invention are able to crosslink between the pigment and the hardener, which is preferably boric acid since the polymer binder is defined as having a chelating property for this hardener. Very efficient crosslinking is obtained. As a result it is possible to use relative high amounts of polymer binder (up to 20% versus 80% of pigment) resulting in good mechanical cohesion and absence of cracking and curling while retaining sufficient porosity.",
        "When the latex is not film-forming it can serve as a pigment. In microporous layers often silica or alumina is used as pigment to create porosity. In the same way a non-film-forming latex can be used as particle to create porosity. Furthermore, when a latex is not film forming the particle surface stays intact and can offer surfaces inside the coating. In a heterogeneous system comprising a non-film-forming latex the surface of the latex can interact for example with the dyes from the ink. In this case, or when for some reason an extra second binder is desired this can be chosen from the compounds well-known in the art of ink-jet recording. Useful binders include hydroxyethyl cellulose; hydroxypropyl cellulose; hydroxyethylmethyl cellulose; hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose; hydroxybutylmethyl cellulose; methyl cellulose; sodium carboxymethyl cellulose; sodium carboxymethylhydroxethyl cellulose; water soluble ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose; cellulose sulfate; polyvinyl alcohol; vinylalcohol copolymers; polyvinyl acetate; polyvinyl acetal; polyvinyl pyrrolidone; polyacrylamide; acrylamide/acrylic acid copolymer; polystyrene, styrene copolymers; acrylic or methacrylic polymers; styrene/acrylic copolymers; ethylene-vinylacetate copolymer; vinylmethyl ether/maleic acid copolymer; poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid); poly(diethylene triamine-co-adipic acid); polyvinyl pyridine; polyvinyl imidazole; polyethylene imine epichlorohydrin modified; polyethylene imine ethoxylated; polyethylene oxide; polyurethane; melamine resins; gelatin; carrageenan; dextran; gum arabic; casein; pectin; albumin; starch; collagen derivatives; collodion and agar-agar.",
