        "The invention relates to methods for stimulating oil and/or gas production through a plurality of perforations in a casing of a wellbore penetrating one or more subterranean formations. More particularly, the invention relates to methods of forming particulate packs in a plurality of perforations in a casing of a wellbore.",
        "To produce hydrocarbons (e.g., crude oil, natural gas, etc.) from the earth, a wellbore can be drilled that penetrates one or more hydrocarbon-bearing strata or subterranean formations, also known as reservoir formations. As used herein, the \u201cperforated interval\u201d or \u201cproduction interval\u201d is the section of a wellbore that has been prepared for production by creating channels between the reservoir formation and the wellbore. In many cases, long reservoir sections will be perforated in several intervals, with short sections of unperforated casing between each interval to enable isolation devices, like packers, to be set for subsequent treatments or remedial operations.",
        "Generally, after a wellbore has been drilled to a desired depth, completion operations can be performed, which is the assembly of downhole tubulars and equipment required to enable production from an oil or gas well. Completion operations can involve the insertion of casing into a wellbore, and thereafter the casing, if desired, can be cemented into place. To produce hydrocarbon from the subterranean formation, one or more perforations can be created that penetrate through the casing, through the cement, and into the production interval.",
        "At some point in the completion operation, a stimulation operation can be performed to enhance hydrocarbon production from the wellbore. Stimulation is a treatment performed to restore or enhance the productivity of a well. Stimulation treatments fall into two main groups, hydraulic fracturing treatments and matrix treatments. Fracturing treatments are performed above the fracture pressure of the reservoir formation and create a highly conductive flow path between the reservoir and the wellbore. Matrix treatments are performed below the reservoir fracture pressure and generally are designed to restore the natural permeability of the reservoir following damage to the near-wellbore area. Thus, stimulation operations can include hydraulic fracturing, acidizing, fracture acidizing, or other suitable stimulation operations.",
        "After the stimulation operation, the wellbore can be placed into production. Generally, the produced hydrocarbons flow from the reservoir, through the perforations of the production intervals with the wellbore and through the wellbore to the surface.",
        "Problems can result in stimulation operations where the wellbore penetrates multiple production intervals due to the variation of fracture gradients between these intervals. The most depleted of the production intervals typically have the lowest fracture gradients among the multiple production intervals. When a stimulation operation is simultaneously conducted on all of the production intervals, the treatment fluid can preferentially enter the most depleted intervals. Therefore, the stimulation operation often does not obtain the full benefit of the stimulation in those production intervals having relatively higher fracture gradients.",
        "One method conventionally used to overcome problems encountered during the stimulation of a subterranean formation having multiple production intervals has been to use packers and/or bridge plugs to isolate the particular production interval before the stimulation operations. This can be problematic, however, due to the existence of open perforations in the wellbore and the potential sticking of these mechanical isolation devices.",
        "Another method conventionally used to overcome problems encountered during the stimulation of a subterranean formation having multiple production intervals has been to perform a remedial cementing operation prior to the stimulation operation to plug the open perforations in the wellbore. This hopefully prevents the undesired entry of the stimulation fluid into the most depleted intervals of the wellbore. After the pre-existing perforations of a depleted production interval have been plugged with cement, the particular production interval can later be re-perforated, isolated, and then stimulated. While these remedial cementing operations can plug the pre-existing perforations and thus reduce the entry of the stimulation fluid into undesired portions of the formation, remedial cementing operations are often complicated and time consuming. This can require multiple remedial cementing operations to ensure complete plugging of all the pre-existing perforations. In addition, remedial cementing operations can damage near wellbore areas of the subterranean formation and/or require further remedial operations to remove undesired cement damage from the near-wellbore area before the well can be placed back into production.",
        "What is needed in the art are improved methods to pack perforations with a consolidating proppant that will allow diversion of treatment fluids to newly perforated intervals during stimulation treatments in wellbores with a plurality of perforated intervals.",
        "The invention relates to subterranean stimulation operations and, more particularly, to methods of stimulating a subterranean formation comprising multiple production intervals. The invention provides a method of forming packs in a plurality of perforations in a casing of a wellbore, the method comprising the steps of: (a) forming a plug of a plugging particulate material in the wellbore of the casing, wherein the plug covers at least one perforation in the casing; (b) forming a pack of a first packing particulate material in at least one perforation located above the plug in the casing; (c) removing at least an upper portion of the plug to expose the at least one perforation in the casing that had been previously covered by at least the upper portion of the plug; and (d) forming a pack of a second packing particulate material in the at least one perforation exposed by removing at least the upper portion of the plug, wherein the second packing particulate material can be the same or different from the first packing particulate material.",

The carrier fluid and the packing particulate material will be discussed further below. The method of the invention advantageously does not require the conduit 128 that introduces the first packing particulate material and first carrier fluid to be positioned adjacent the target perforations to be packed during the packing process. Thus, the new method avoids having to have conduit 128 below all perforations 142, 144, 146, 148 of a casing 104 during the packing process, thus avoiding the chances for the conduit 128 becoming stuck in the wellbore 100 by the packing particulate material.

Surface pumping pressures can be monitored to determine when particulate packs 124 have formed in each of the plurality of perforations 142, 144, 146, 148. For example, when the surface pumping pressures of the carrier fluid increase above a pressure necessary for the downhole pressures to exceed the fracture gradients of production intervals 106, 108, 110, 112 without fracturing of such intervals, particulate packs 124 should have formed in each of the plurality of perforations 142, 144, 146, 148.",

In one embodiment, back pressure is applied on annulus 120 by limiting the return of the carrier fluid up through annulus 120 by utilizing a choke mechanism at the surface (not shown). As the carrier fluid enters plurality of perforations 142, 144, 146, 148 and is squeezed into the matrix of subterranean formation 102, the packing particulate material in the carrier fluid should bridge in plurality of perforations 142, 144, 146, 148 and thus pack into plurality of perforations 142, 144, 146, 148 forming particulate packs 124 therein.

In some embodiments, at least one remedial perforation 138 can be created in second casing interval 109 and a stimulation fluid can be introduced into wellbore 100 and into the at least one remedial perforation 138 created therein so as to contact the second production interval 108 of subterranean formation 106. In some embodiments, as illustrated in FIG. 10, hydraulic jetting tool 126 can be positioned adjacent to second casing interval 109 and used to create at least one remedial perforation 138 in second casing interval 109. Thereafter, in the manner described above, at least one fracture 140 can be created or enhanced along at least one remedial perforation 138. In certain embodiments of the invention wherein an operator uses the methods of the invention to stimulate multiple production intervals of subterranean formation 102 (such as production intervals 106, 108, 110, 112), the operator can elect to sequentially stimulate the production intervals intersected by wellbore 100, beginning with the deepest production interval (e.g., first production interval 106), and sequentially stimulating the shallower desired intervals, such as production intervals 108, 110, 112.",
        "In certain embodiments, clean-out fluids optionally can be introduced into wellbore 100 by pumping down the conduit 128 into the wellbore 100. Generally, clean-out fluids, where used, can be introduced into wellbore 100 at any suitable time as desired by one of ordinary skill in the art, for example, to e.g., to clean out debris, cuttings, pipe dope, and other materials from wellbore 100 and inside equipment, such as conduit 128 or hydraulic jetting tool 126 that can be disposed in wellbore 100. For example, a clean out fluid can be used after completion of the stimulation operations so as to remove the plugs, such as plug 136 that can be in wellbore 100. In some embodiments, the clean out fluid can be used after the carrier fluid has been introduced into wellbore 100 so as to remove any of the packing particulate material that is loose in wellbore 100. Generally, the clean-out fluids should not be circulated into wellbore 100 at sufficient rates and pressures to impact the integrity of particulate packs 124. Generally, the cleaning fluid can be any conventional fluid used to prepare a formation for stimulation, such as water-based or oil-based fluids. In some embodiments, these cleaning fluids can be energized fluids that contain a gas, such as nitrogen or air.",
        "While the above-described steps describe the use of conduit 128 to introduce the carrier fluid and the filling carrier fluid into wellbore 100, any suitable methodology can be used to introduce such fluids into wellbore 100. In some embodiments, work string 128 with hydraulic jetting tool 126 attached thereto and optional valve subassembly 129 attached to the end of hydraulic jetting tool 126 can be used in the above-described step of introducing the carrier fluid containing packing particulate material into wellbore 100. This can save at least one trip out of the wellbore, between the steps of packing the packing particulate material into plurality of perforations 142, 144, 146, 148 and perforating at least one remedial perforation 132 because the same downhole equipment can be used for both steps. For example, hydraulic jetting tool 126 can have a longitudinal fluid flow passageway extending therethrough and optional valve subassembly 129 can have a longitudinal fluid flow passageway extending therethrough. When optional valve subassembly 129 is not activated, fluid flows down through work string 128, into hydraulic jetting tool 126, and out through optional valve subassembly 129. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the carrier fluid can be introduced into wellbore 100 by pumping the carrier fluid down work string 128, into hydraulic jetting tool 126, and out into wellbore 100 through optional valve subassembly 129. Similarly, filling carrier fluid also can be introduced into wellbore 100. When desired to perform the above-described remedial perforation and/or stimulation steps, optional valve subassembly 129 should be activated thereby causing the flow of fluid to discharge through at least one port 127.",
        "The first, second, and next carrier fluid for the first, second and next packing particulate material, respectively, can include any suitable fluids that can be used to transport packing particulates in subterranean operations. In one embodiment, the first, second, and next carrier fluid are selected to be the same. Suitable fluids for the first, second and third carrier fluid include ungelled aqueous fluids, aqueous gels, hydrocarbon-based gels, foams, emulsions, viscoelastic surfactant gels, and any other suitable fluid. Where the carrier fluid is an ungelled aqueous fluid, it should be introduced into the wellbore at a sufficient rate to transport the packing particulate material. Suitable emulsions can be comprised of two immiscible liquids such as an aqueous liquid or gelled liquid and a hydrocarbon. Foams can be created by the addition of a gas, such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen. Suitable aqueous gels are generally comprised of water and one or more gelling agents.",
        "In a one embodiment, the carrier fluid for the packing particulate material is an aqueous gel comprised of water, a gelling agent for gelling the aqueous component and increasing its viscosity, and, optionally, a crosslinking agent for crosslinking the gel and further increasing the viscosity of the fluid. The increased viscosity of the gelled, or gelled and crosslinked, aqueous gels, inter alia, reduces fluid loss and enhances the suspension properties thereof. An example of a suitable crosslinked aqueous gel is a borate fluid system utilized in the \u201cDelta Frac\u00ae\u201d fracturing service, commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services, Duncan Okla. Another example of a suitable crosslinked aqueous gel is a borate fluid system utilized in the \u201cSeaquest\u00ae\u201d fracturing service, commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services, Duncan, Okla. The water used to form the aqueous gel can be fresh water, saltwater, brine, or any other aqueous liquid that does not adversely react with the other components. The density of the water can be increased to provide additional particle transport and suspension in the invention.",
        "As mentioned above, the first, second, and next packing particulate material can be selected to be the same or different. The packing particulate material is selected to be of a size to pack a perforation 142, 144, 146, and 148 in the casing 104. Furthermore, the first, second, and next carrier fluid that carries first, second and next packing particulate material can be selected to be the same or different. The packing particulate material as used in accordance with the invention are generally particulate of a size such that the particulate bridge plurality of perforations 142, 144, 146, 148 in casing 104 and form proppant packs 124 therein. The packing particulate for use in the packing particulate material can have an average particle size in the range of from about 10 mesh to about 100 mesh. A wide variety of particulates can be used as the first, second, and next packing particulate material in accordance with the invention. For example, the first, second, and the next packing particulate material can be independently selected from the group consisting of sand; bauxite; ceramic materials; glass materials; polymer materials; synthetic fluorine-containing polymeric materials, e.g., TEFLON\u00ae; nut shell pieces; seed shell pieces; cured resinous particulates comprising nut shell pieces; cured resinous particulates comprising seed shell pieces; fruit pit pieces; cured resinous particulates comprising fruit pit pieces; wood; composite particulates; and combinations thereof.

Generally, the packing particulate material can be present in the carrier fluid in an amount in an amount sufficient to form the desired proppant packs 124 in plurality of perforations 142, 144, 146, 148. In some embodiments, the packing particulate material, can be present in the carrier fluid in an amount in the range of from about 2 pounds to about 12 pounds per gallon of the carrier fluid not inclusive of the packing particulate material.",
        "Generally, the packing particulate material does not degrade in the presence of hydrocarbon fluids and other fluids present in portion of the subterranean formation; this allows the packing particulate material to maintain their integrity in the presence of produced hydrocarbon products, formation water, and other compositions normally produced from subterranean formations. However, in some embodiments of the invention, the packing particulate material can comprise degradable materials. Degradable materials can be included in the packing particulate material, for example, so that proppant packs 124 can degrade over time. Such degradable materials are capable of undergoing an irreversible degradation downhole. The term \u201cirreversible\u201d as used herein means that the degradable material, once degraded downhole, should not recrystallize or reconsolidate, e.g., the degradable material should degrade in situ but should not recrystallize or reconsolidate in situ.",
        "The degradable materials can degrade by any suitable mechanism. Suitable degradable materials can be water-soluble, gas-soluble, oil-soluble, biodegradable, temperature degradable, solvent-degradable, acid-soluble, oxidizer-degradable, or a combination thereof. Suitable degradable materials include a variety of degradable materials suitable for use in subterranean operations and can comprise dehydrated materials, waxes, boric acid flakes, degradable polymers, calcium carbonate, paraffins, crosslinked polymer gels, combinations thereof, and the like. One example of a suitable degradable crosslinked polymer gel is \u201cMax Seal\u2122\u201d fluid loss control additive, commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services, Duncan, Okla. An example of a suitable degradable polymeric material is \u201cBioBalls\u2122\u201d perforation ball sealers, commercially available from Santrol Corporation, Fresno, Tex.",
        "In some embodiments, the degradable material comprises an oil-soluble material. Where such oil-soluble materials are used, the oil-soluble materials can be degraded by the produced fluids, thus degrading particulate packs 124 so as to unblock plurality of perforations 142, 144, 146, 148. Suitable oil-soluble materials include either natural or synthetic polymers, such as, for example, polyacrylics, polyamides, and polyolefins (such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisobutylene, and polystyrene).",
        "Suitable examples of degradable polymers that can be used in accordance with the invention include, but are not limited to, homopolymers, random, block, graft, and star- and hyper-branched polymers. Specific examples of suitable polymers include polysaccharides (such as dextran or cellulose); chitin; chitosan; proteins; aliphatic polyesters; poly(lactide); poly(glycolide); poly(\u03b5-caprolactone); poly(hydroxybutyrate); poly(anhydrides); aliphatic polycarbonates; poly(ortho esters); poly(amino acids); poly(ethylene oxide); polyphosphazenes; copolymers thereof; and combinations thereof. Polyanhydrides are another type of particularly suitable degradable polymer useful in the invention. Examples of suitable polyanhydrides include poly(adipic anhydride), poly(suberic anhydride), poly(sebacic anhydride), poly(dodecanedioic anhydride). Other suitable examples include but are not limited to poly(maleic anhydride) and poly(benzoic anhydride). One skilled in the art will recognize that plasticizers can be included in forming suitable polymeric degradable materials of the invention. The plasticizers can be present in an amount sufficient to provide the desired characteristics, for example, more effective compatibilization of the melt blend components, improved processing characteristics during the blending and processing steps, and control and regulation of the sensitivity and degradation of the polymer by moisture.",
        "Suitable dehydrated compounds are those materials that will degrade over time when rehydrated. For example, a particulate solid dehydrated salt or a particulate solid anhydrous borate material that degrades over time can be suitable. Specific examples of particulate solid anhydrous borate materials that can be used include but are not limited to anhydrous sodium tetraborate (also known as anhydrous borax), and anhydrous boric acid. These anhydrous borate materials are only slightly soluble in water. However, with time and heat in a subterranean environment, the anhydrous borate materials react with the surrounding aqueous fluid and are hydrated. The resulting hydrated borate materials are substantially soluble in water as compared to anhydrous borate materials and as a result degrade in the aqueous fluid.",
        "Blends of certain degradable materials and other compounds can also be suitable. One example of a suitable blend of materials is a mixture of poly(lactic acid) and sodium borate where the mixing of an acid and base could result in a neutral solution where this is desirable. Another example would include a blend of poly(lactic acid) and boric oxide. In choosing the appropriate degradable material or materials, one should consider the degradation products that will result. The degradation products should not adversely affect subterranean operations or components. The choice of degradable material also can depend, at least in part, on the conditions of the well, e.g., wellbore temperature. For instance, lactides have been found to be suitable for lower temperature wells, including those within the range of 60\u00b0 F. to 150\u00b0 F., and polylactides have been found to be suitable for wellbore temperatures above this range. Poly(lactic acid) and dehydrated salts can be suitable for higher temperature wells. Also, in some embodiments a preferable result is achieved if the degradable material degrades slowly over time as opposed to instantaneously. In some embodiments, it can be desirable when the degradable material does not substantially degrade until after the degradable material has been substantially placed in a desired location within a subterranean formation.",
        "In certain embodiments of the invention, the packing particulates are coated with an adhesive substance. As used herein, the term \u201cadhesive substance\u201d refers to a material that is capable of being coated onto a particulate and that exhibits a sticky or tacky character such that the proppant particulates that have adhesive thereon have a tendency to create clusters or aggregates. As used herein, the term \u201ctacky,\u201d in all of its forms, generally refers to a substance having a nature such that it is (or can be activated to become) somewhat sticky to the touch. Generally, the packing particulates can be coated with an adhesive substance so that the packing particulate material once placed within plurality of perforations 142, 144, 146, 148 to form particulate packs 124 can consolidate into the packing particulate material into a hardened mass. Adhesive substances suitable for use in the invention include non-aqueous tackifying agents; aqueous tackifying agents; silyl-modified polyamides; and curable resin compositions that are capable of curing to form hardened substances.",
        "Tackifying agents suitable for use in the consolidation fluids of the invention comprise any compound that, when in liquid form or in a solvent solution, will form a non-hardening coating upon a particulate. A particularly preferred group of tackifying agents comprise polyamides that are liquids or in solution at the temperature of the subterranean formation such that they are, by themselves, non-hardening when introduced into the subterranean formation. A particularly preferred product is a condensation reaction product comprised of commercially available polyacids and a polyamine.

In this instance, the tackifying agent can function similarly to a hardenable resin. Multifunctional materials suitable for use in the invention include, but are not limited to, aldehydes such as formaldehyde, dialdehydes such as glutaraldehyde, hemiacetals or aldehyde releasing compounds, diacid halides, dihalides such as dichlorides and dibromides, polyacid anhydrides such as citric acid, epoxides, furfuraldehyde, glutaraldehyde or aldehyde condensates and the like, and combinations thereof.

Generally, suitable aqueous tackifier agents are not significantly tacky when placed onto a particulate, but are capable of being \u201cactivated\u201d (that is destabilized, coalesced and/or reacted) to transform the compound into a sticky, tackifying compound at a desirable time. Such activation can occur before, during, or after the aqueous tackifier compound is placed in the subterranean formation. In some embodiments, a pretreatment can be first contacted with the surface of a particulate to prepare it to be coated with an aqueous tackifier compound. Suitable aqueous tackifying agents are generally charged polymers that comprise compounds that, when in an aqueous solvent or solution, will form a non-hardening coating (by itself or with an activator) and, when placed on a particulate, will increase the continuous critical resuspension velocity of the particulate when contacted by a stream of water.",

Some suitable resins, such as epoxy resins, can be cured with an internal catalyst or activator so that when pumped down hole, they can be cured using only time and temperature. Other suitable resins, such as furan resins generally require a time-delayed catalyst or an external catalyst to help activate the polymerization of the resins if the cure temperature is low (i.e., less than 250\u00b0 F.), but will cure under the effect of time and temperature if the formation temperature is above about 250\u00b0 F., preferably above about 300\u00b0 F.
