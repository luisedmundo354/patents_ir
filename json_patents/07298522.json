        "The present invention relates to a printing technology.",
        "With sophisticated information processing technologies, a multiplicity of information devices are used in a variety of scenes in the society. Then, an enormous quantity of information is printed by printers. Particularly over the recent years, images captured by digital cameras etc are printed by color printers in the great majority of cases. The color print involves especially a large quantity of toner consumption.",
        "Accordingly, a running cost that depends upon the toner consumption is not ignorable nowadays. This being the case, a scheme for saving the toners has hitherto been proposed.",
        "What is known as a toner save technology for this purpose is a method of extracting an outline of character/graphic data after being developed on, e.g., a bitmap memory. This method serves to restrain a quantity of toners by diminishing a dot size of an internal area or the outline of the character/graphic data (which may be called a prior art 1).",
        "Another known method is that the toner quantity is restrained by thinning out at a fixed ratio the data after similarly being developed on the bitmap memory (wherein the dots occupying a fixed ratio per unit area are removed off) (which may be called a prior art 2). Alternative known method is that the toner quantity is restrained by increasing at a fixed ratio the brightness of the print data as a whole (which may be called a prior art 3).",
        "These prior arts, however, have no scheme of distinguishing between categories of the print data such as characters, graphic, images etc, and the toner save is carried out by the same method with respect to all pieces of print data. Therefore, the toner save optimal to every category of the print data was not actualized. Then, as a result, the toner save function described above proved poor of a print quality and was therefore unusable except at a print level for trial.",
        "The prior art 1 is effective in, for example, the characters and graphics with no expression of halftones (intermediate colors), but raises a problem of being unable to functioning effectively in the characters and graphics involving the expressions of images and halftones. This is because it is difficult to extract the outline of the character and graphic containing the halftone expression.",
        "Particularly in the case of the color print, the processing is effected for four colors Y (yellow), M (magenta), C (cyan) and K (black), and hence the halftone expression is indispensable for the character and graphic. The prior art 1 was not therefore applicable to the color print.",
        "Further, the prior art 2 also has problems in a pattern having a periodicity in the print data and in a dot pattern. Namely, in the case of thinning out the above print data at the fixed ratio, an irregularity in period due to interference with the pattern period becomes conspicuous, which did not lead to a preferable result of printing.",
        "Moreover, the prior art 3 has a possibility in which sharpness (clearness) conceived important in terms of an image quality might be deteriorated because of increasing the brightness of the character/graphic/image as a whole. Further, when applied to a small character and a fine line, a solid line might be printed as if a dotted line and might appear lighter than a brightness improving rate specified.",
        "Further, there has seen a leap in improvements of the quality and performance of a color printer over the recent years, and a printed result having substantially the same quality as a photograph has been acquired. There is provided a product capable of outputting such a high-quality print at the same printing speed as that of a monochromatic printer (that outputs a binary monochrome pattern and will hereinafter be simply termed a monochrome printer or a monochrome machine).",
        "Furthermore, a product price rapidly decreases, and there is a possibility wherein the market shares of the monochrome printers and color printers will be reversed several years later. For attaining this share-turnabout, a print cost per page is a bottleneck.",
        "A cost for using the toners for a color print is higher than a cost for a monochrome print. Then, if print target data are categorized as a material for presentation that contains natural images and background colors, a print area increases. Therefore, the print of such data involves a further increase in toner spent quantity.",
        "On the other hand, if a large quantity of prints can be attained owing to a decrease in price of the main unit of the printer product, there might be a strict request for a running cost in terms of purchasing the printer product.",
        "It is a primary object of the present invention, which was devised to obviate the problems inherent in the prior arts described above, to efficiently reduce a spent quantity of color materials such as toners in a way that restrains a decline of print quality.",
        "To accomplish the above object, according to one aspect of the present invention, a print control system for controlling a print of print target data containing color specifying information, comprises a data distinguishing module (12) distinguishing between pieces of element data contained in the print target data, and a color adjusting module (13, 14, 15, 16, 17) adjusting a mix of color materials on the basis of the color specifying information according to a category of the element data.",
        "Preferably, the print control system may further comprise a converting module (19-1 through 19-N) converting the color specifying information into mix specifying information for specifying a mix of the color material, and the color adjusting module (13, 14, 15, 16, 17) may adjust the mix specifying information according to the category of the element data.",
        "Preferably, the print control system may further comprise an information input module inputting save specifying information for saving the color materials when printing according to the category of the element data, and the color adjusting module (13, 14, 15, 16, 17) may save the color materials when printing by adjusting the mix specifying information based on the save specifying information according to the category of the element data.",
        "Preferably, the print control system may further comprise a categorizing module (16) categorizing the element data on the basis of dimension attributes, and the color adjusting module (13, 14, 15, 16, 17) may adjust the mix specifying information in accordance with the dimension attributes.",
        "Preferably, the print control system may further comprise an information input module inputting information on resolutions used when printing, and the color adjusting module (13, 14, 15, 16, 17) may adjust the mix specifying information in accordance with the resolutions used when printing.",
        "According to another aspect of the present invention, a print control system for controlling a print of print target data containing color specifying information comprises an information input module inputting information on a difference from a coloring value based on the color specifying information, and a color adjusting module (13, 14, 15, 16, 17) adjusting a mix of color materials on the basis of the color specifying information within a range of the difference, and minimizing a consuming quantity of the color materials. The color adjusting module (13, 14, 15, 16, 17) may adjust the mix of the color materials in such a direction as to reduce a consuming quantity of the color material.",
        "Preferably, the print control system may further comprise a converting module (19-1 through 19-N) converting the color specifying information into mix specifying information for specifying a mix of the color material.",
        "According to a further aspect of the present invention, a print control method of controlling a print of print target data containing color specifying information comprises distinguishing between pieces of element data contained in the print target data (S1), and color adjustment adjusting a mix of color materials on the basis of the color specifying information according to a category of the element data (S3, S5, S6).",
        "As described above, according to the present invention, the color materials (for an example, toner) save function usable not for a mere print for trial but for a utilizable operation can be provided by adjusting the mix of the color materials individually corresponding to the print data and the draw attributes.",

The architecture and functions of this type of host computer 1 are broadly known, and their explanations are herein omitted.",
        "The color printer 2 is a device that receives a command from the host computer 1 and prints the information outputted by the host computer 1 on a sheet. What is characteristic of the printing system in the first embodiment is a function of adjusting a quantity of how much a color material (which will hereinafter be referred to as a toner) is used for printing.",
        "Accordingly, there is no limit to printing methods as hardware of the color printer 2. Namely, what is usable as the color printer 2 may be various types of printers such as an inkjet printer, a bubble jet printer, a laser printer, a thermal transfer printer and so on.",
        "The host computer 1 is connected via a variety of interfaces to the color printer 2. The connection therebetween may involve the use of the hardware interface such as a serial interface like USB (Universal Serial Bus) etc and a parallel interface like SCSI (Small computer System Interface), a Centronics-based interface etc. A LAN such as Ethernet and others may also be extended between the host computer 1 and the color printer 2. In this case, a connection between the color printer 2 and the LAN may be established by use of a printer server.",

        "<Function Architecture>",
        "FIG. 2 shows the function architecture of the toner save function in the present printing system. In the first embodiment, this toner save function is actualized as a program on, e.g., the host computer 1.",
        "As shown in FIG. 2, the toner save function is constructed of a draw specifying module 11 of an application program (that is simply termed \u201cApplication\u201d in FIG. 2), a character/graphic/image distinguishing module 12, a character toner save level selection module 13, a graphic toner save level selection module 14, an image toner save level selection module 15, a draw-attribute-based toner save level adjusting module 16, a print-resolution-based toner save level adjusting module 17, a color conversion mode selection module 18, color conversion modules 19-1 to 19-N, a bitmap development module 20, and a bitmap data print module 21.",
        "The draw specifying module 11 of the application program is, for example, a print menu displayed in a menu bar in a window. A user's request for printing is transferred through this print menu to the printing system.",
        "The character/graphic/image distinguishing module 12 is a program module for distinguishing between a character, a graphic and an image of print target information. The print data specified by the application program are specified as character/graphic/image attribute commands and a draw command in accordance with a rule of a predetermined page description language.",
        "For example, on the platform of Windows system, a draw command interface (function call) defined as GDI (Graphic Device Interface) which is transferred as application program OS printer drive, is specified.",
        "Hence, for instance, in the case of implementing the toner save with the printer driver, one of the character/graphic/image. draw commands is uniquely recognizable within functions of a graphics library called by the function call given from the application program.",
        "The character toner save level selection module 13, when printing the character data, adjusts a toner save level, i.e., a toner spent quantity.",
        "Further, the graphic toner save level selection module 14, when printing the graphic data, adjusts the toner save level, i.e., the toner spent quantity. Herein, the graphic data are defined as a pattern drawn by lines and dots. In the graphic data, a dot, a line, a variety of polygons, circular arcs etc are defined in distinction from other points, lines polygons and circular arcs.",
        "Moreover, the image toner save level selection module 15, when printing the image data, adjusts the toner save level, i.e., the toner spent quantity. Herein, the image data are defined as a pattern expressed as an aggregation of dots known as pixels. The image data are, however, unlike the graphic data, undistinguishable individually between the dot, line and graphic within the image.",
        "The draw-attribute-based toner save level adjusting module 16 adjusts the toner save level in accordance with draw target attributes. The draw target attributes are, for example, a character dimension, a line width, a dot size and so on.",
        "The draw-attribute-based toner save level adjusting module 16 executes a process of restraining the toner save with respect to a small character, a thin line and a fine dot which are equal to less than predetermined values. Further, the draw-attribute-based toner save level adjusting module 16 rules a fill pattern to the area such as a hatching pattern and a dot pattern out of thin-out processing targets.",
        "The print-resolution-based toner save level adjusting module 17 adjusts the toner save level in accordance with a print resolution. For instance, in a low resolution mode, the print-resolution-based toner save level adjusting module 17 increases the tone save level to a value of an user's specification. Further, in a high resolution mode, the print-resolution-based toner save level adjusting module 17 decreases the toner save level to a value of an user's specification, and so forth.",
        "The color conversion mode selection module 18 selects a proper color conversion module among the color conversion modules 19-1 to 19-N, corresponding to the toner save level adjusted in the process by each of the modules described above. The color conversion modules 19-1 to 19-N convert the color data expressed in colors R, G and B into coloring data (Y: Yellow, M: Magenta, C: Cyan, and K: Black) of the toners used by the color printer 2.",
        "The bitmap development module 20 develops the draw target into bitmapped data Y, M, C and K. The bitmap data print module 21 transfers the bitmapped data developed by the bitmap development module 20 to the toner output unit of the color printer 2.",

Then, all data batchwise checkbox 102, and three pieces of radio buttons thereunder (a character radio button 103, a graphic radio button 104 and an image radio button 105) are displayed in the detail setting menu.",
        "When the user sets the batchwise checkbox 102 effective, the respective radio buttons are displayed in gray-out. As a result, the character radio button 103 and other buttons 104, 105 are unusable, and the toner save is specified at a uniform level with respect to the three categories of draw data.",
        "One of \u201csmall\u201d, \u201cMedium\u201d and \u201clarge\u201d toner save levels is selected in a side bar displayed on the right side. Herein, the \u201clarge\u201d toner save level is a setting for saving the toner with a predetermined value or larger. Further, the \u201csmall\u201d toner save level is a setting for saving the toner with the predetermined value or smaller. Moreover, the \u201cMedium\u201d toner save level is a setting assumed to be specified most in a normal case.",
        "When setting the all data batchwise checkbox 102 ineffective, the gray-out display of the three radio buttons 103 through 105 is canceled, and these buttons become selectable. In the selectable state of these radio buttons 103 to 105, when setting these buttons effective, the slide bar for each item of data is selectable. If the radio button is not set effective, however, the tone save for the data set with this ineffective radio button is not executed.",

In this lookup table, a color conversion such as RGB=>YMCK is specified based on the toner save level. Referring again to FIG. 4, the numerals 1 to N shown in a left upper portion indicate categories of the lookup tables. In the first embodiment, for instance, the color conversion module 19-1 executes the color conversion based on this lookup table (1).",
        "Each of the lookup tables (1 through N) contains toner quantities (values of Y, M, C and K) needed for colorings of the R, G and B values. This mapping is obtained by a colorimetric device (e.g., a variable angle spectrophotometer) that actually measures a print sample with the Y,M,C and K values.",
        "As a result of such a measurement, plural sets of YMCK values ((yi, mi, ci, ki), where i=1, . . . N) approximate to colors exhibiting specific RGB values (r, g, b) are obtained within a predetermined color difference range. The color difference is a difference between the values measured by the colorimetric device.",
        "In such a color conversion from (r, g, b) into (yi, mi, ci, ki), the lookup table (1) retains a combination exhibiting a maximum toner spent quantity. The large toner spent quantity implies basically a large total value of the respective values of (yi, mi, ci, ki).",
        "Further, the lookup table (2) retains a combination exhibiting the second largest toner spent quantity. Thus, in each color conversion from (r, g, b) into (yi, mi, ci, ki), the lookup tables (1 through N) are created in sequence according to the toner use quantities.",
        "As described above, for example, the lookup table (N) retains a combination of (yi, mi, ci, ki) exhibiting a minimum toner spent quantity. If retaining such an RGB combination for all of values 0 through 255, however, entries for 256\u00d7256\u00d7256=3,670,016 colors per lookup table are needed, and the colorimetric process is enormously time-consuming.",
        "Such being the case, according to the first embodiment, each lookup table is prepared with the RGB values on every 16-unit basis and retains (yi, mi, ci, ki) values corresponding thereto. In this case, one single lookup table needs 4096 pieces of entries (16\u00d716\u00d716=4096). Further, the (yi, mi, ci, ki) corresponding to the RGB values other than those value may be obtained by interpolation.",

        "Then, when the thus obtained RGB values (rj,gj,bj) (where j=1, . . . L) are color-converted into YMCK values, there is obtained such j (it is now assumed that this value be j0) as to minimize the toner consuming quantity (that is a total value given by Y+M+C+K) (S74).",
        "Next, an (ri,gi,bi)-to-(rj,gj,bj) conversion mapping is recorded in an i-th entry of the lookup table (S75).",
        "Subsequently, the counter value i is incremented (S76). Then, it is judged whether the counter value i exceeds a count M in (ri,gi,bi) (S77). Thus, the processes in S72 through S75 are repeated for all of (ri,gi,bi).",
        "Next, the created lookup table is stored (S78). Thereafter, the lookup table creating process comes to an end.",
        "The color conversion may be executed based on the thus created lookup table in the same way as done in the first or second embodiment. In this case, the lookup table for the RGB-to-YMCK color conversion with no toner save may be combined with the lookup table created by the processing in FIG. 16.",
        "<Effect of Embodiment>",
        "As discussed above, the printing system in the third embodiment is capable of creating the lookup table used for executing the color conversion so that the toner consuming quantity is minimized within the color difference dA range specified by the user. The color conversion is executed in a way that combines this lookup table with the lookup table for the RGB-to-YMCK color conversion with no toner save, whereby the color conversion can be executed so that the toner consuming quantity is minimized within the color difference range specified by the user, i.e., so that the toner save is maximized.",
        "In this case, the color conversion may be executed individually based on the lookup table for the toner save and the lookup table for the RGB-to-YMCK color conversion. Further, the two types of tables may be synthesized, and the color conversions may also be executed at one time.",
        "<Modified Example>",
        "According to the third embodiment, all sets (L-sets) of RGB values (rj,gj,bj) falling within the color difference dA range with respect to the RGB values (ri,gi,bi), are obtained, and such a value of j as to maximize the toner save is determined. The embodiment of the present invention is not, however, restricted such procedures.",
        "For example, there may be determined such a value of j as to maximize the toner save with respect to a predetermined number of samples among the L-sets of RGB values (rj,gj,bj) described above.",
        "The sample may be obtained by, for instance, formally thinning out the sets of values (rj,gj,bj) obtained above. Namely, the sample may be extracted at an interval of the plural sets by sorting the sets of values (rj,gj,bj). Further, a predetermined number of sets may also be extracted as samples in sequence from those exhibiting a larger total value of rj+gj+bj in terms of a relationship of the complement shown in the formula 1.",
        "According to the third embodiment, the lookup table is created on the 8-unit basis. The embodiment of the present invention is not, confined to the lookup table created on the 8-unit basis.",

In this case, the data communication signal takes a base band waveform with no carrier wave. Accordingly, the data communication signal embodied in the carrier wave maybe anyone of a modulated broadband signal and an unmodulated base band signal (corresponding to a case of setting a DC signal having a voltage of 0 as a carrier wave)."
