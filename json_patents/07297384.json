No. 08/781,285 and its corresponding PCT application no. PCT/US97/00473 (published as WO 97/25196 on 17 Jul. 1997), both filed 10 Jan. 1997. However, this is not a continuation or continuation-in-part of any of these patent applications.",

        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "This invention relates to an improved flexible laminate that includes multiple film layers and which is used in shipping, storage, and preservation of foodstuffs, medical supplies or like items that may be heat sensitive. The present invention also relates to flexible laminates which are used in sheet or rolled form to provide thermal, aqueous vapor, and environmental barriers in buildings or structures such as homes, factories or storage facilities. The present invention is defined as a thermal barrier with respect to the reflection and insulation from impinging thermal radiation from the ultra-violet to the long-wave infrared wavelengths emitted by any thermal source.",
        "2. General Background of the Invention",
        "There is a need in remote seafood processing locations, such as rural Alaska, for improved materials and methods to be used in the short-term holding and transportation of fresh fisheries products. This need stems from: the high costs associated with transporting Styrofoam-based packaging that requires a large storage volume. Also in dealing with the many unanticipated events of the fishing year and the consumer markets for the products, if the demand for Styrofoam-based products has not been accurately forecast, supplies of packaging materials may be low when the volume of fresh seafood products is high. In these circumstances of high processing volume and depleted stores of Styrofoam packaging, gel ice in Wetlock cases (wax-coated corrugated cardboard boxes) is not the preferred substitute, but it is now all that is available.",
        "Prior use of laminates has been in electrostatic, vapor barrier or container forms which solely rely on the imperviousness and strength of the material to retain an object or material with the confines of the form. Unlike prior containers of barrier materials the present invention provides properties through a unique lay-up of materials which provide thermal, vapor and strength qualities which exceed the usual composition and fabrication.",
        "The U.S. Patents mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference.",
        "A number of patents have issued for various metallized fabrics and layered film constructions that purport to provide heat retention, insulation or like qualities.",
        "Metallized fabric is the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 4,508,776. In the '776 patent, a microporous metallized fabric suitable for use as a thermally insulating material in a hostile environment includes a microporous fabric substrate for example of a spun bonded polyethylene having a layer of aluminum deposited thereon by a vacuum depositing technique. A thin layer\u2014typically of 0.9-1.0 g/m2-of a polyamide based ink is then printed on to the metallizing, by way of a photogravure printing process, in such a way as not to affect the porous structure of the metallized fabric. The metallized fabric of this invention finds a particular application as screening for commercial glass-houses, to reduce the heat losses therefrom.",
        "The Workman patent, U.S. Pat. No. 4,537,313, provides an insulated bag of a multi-layer construction employing nylon fabric as inner and outer liners, thermal suede as a thermal insulation inside the outer liner, needle punched Dacron fabric as a vapor and thermal barrier, aluminum foil as a thermal barrier, and metallized Mylar as a vapor barrier.",
        "Another metallized fabric is the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 4,657,807. In the '807 patent, a bright finish metal-covered fabric having a metal layer deposited on fabric is disclosed. A fabric, selected to be capable of flattening or polishing under heat and pressure, is pressed against a heated surface and is then vacuum metallized. In a preferred embodiment, a thermoplastic fabric is flattened against a hot roll in a calender press under high pressure, and aluminum is then vapor-deposited.",
        "A thermal gain sensor is the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 4,401,104.",
        "A metal foil or plastic film clad reinforced resin substrate is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,916,016.",
        "An insulation structure for appliances is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,985,106 issued to Nelson.",
        "A freight container insulating system and method is the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 5,105,970.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 5,108,821 discloses a self-extinguishing blanket enclosed with plastic films.",
        "A leak-proof insulating system for freight containers is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,245. The portions of the apparatus are in the form of multi-layered side walls. Part of the construction uses cross-linked polyethylene foam.",
        "The Anderson patent, U.S. Pat. No. 5,324,467, discloses a process for preparation of oriented multi-layer laminate film.",
        "The present invention is an improvement over these prior art patented constructions.",
        "The preferred embodiment of the present invention is primarily composed of a reflective material which consists of vapor deposited aluminum on a polyester film, with additional laminate being further applied so that a thin sheet of material is created that can be stored on a standard size roll (for example, 55 inches (1.4 meters) in width and up to 600 feet (183 meters) in length).",
        "Metallized polyester acts as a temperature resistant material. Thermal heat is reflected by the metallized polyester. The polyethylene films and polyethylene foams act as insulation and/or thermal barriers. Contents of packaging made of this material are insulated from the metallized polyester and conduction of heat from the metallized polyester. When the metallized polyester laminated to a polyethylene film is used in housing, it acts as insulation because the metallized polyester reflects heat away from the house. The same material can be used in automobiles, trucks and other vehicles for insulation from different heat sources, e.g. engines and radiant heat from the sun. This material has many applications.",
        "The present invention comprises various light-weight composite embodiments. The first embodiment comprises a lamination of the primary metallized polyester film to low-density polyethylene film using a polyester adhesive. The lamination of the primary and secondary films through a set of gravure cylinders using heat and pressure joins the materials through the thermoplastic polyester adhesive such that a reflective barrier and high-strength skin are formed.",
        "Another embodiment is the lamination of the primary metallized polyester film to relatively thin polyethylene foam which is further laminated to an additional polyethylene film. Each lamination in this embodiment is processed through gravure cylinders using a heat and pressure sensitive polyester adhesive. The layers comprise a finished, rolled sheet of material which may be further processed into heat-resistant bags, totes, pouches, and insulating sheets which have a high radiant barrier quality, high tensile strength and reduced thermal conduction for the item enclosed in the bag.",
        "Yet another embodiment is lamination of the metallized polyester film to an additional polyester film through a gravure cylinder process using heat and pressure with a heat and pressure sensitive polyester adhesive. The use of polyester substrates in total with the highly reflective thermal barrier created provides for higher material ignition temperature as well as high longitudinal and transversal tensile strengths. A variation of this embodiment is a coating of acrylic applied specifically to the side of the finished laminate intended to be placed in an environmentally exposed position which may be subject to ultra-violet radiation such as from the Sun.",
        "Because of the high optical density and the low emissivity of this material, packaging, insulation, or any device derived from this material outperforms in many ways many materials made prior to the material.",
        "The apparatus of the present invention can be made into rolls of material consisting of metallized polyester and part, some and/or all of the thermal barriers. The material from the rolls can be used by itself for insulation for structures or fabricated into canopies, tarps, tents or other structures, freestanding or attached. The material can be used for several kinds of insulation to protect against heat e.g. trucks, cars. The product is fabricated and heat-sealed or sewed into polybags (with or without a zip-lock type closure, and in any size of any currently commercially available polybags, such as zip-lock freezer and sandwich bags, for example), cargo container covers, umbrellas, hats and other forms of packaging and garments. Polybags with handles for such uses as portable coolers and carryouts (hot and cold) for perishables, e.g. fresh fish or hot meals, are other applications for the material.",
        "The present invention thus provides a thermal radiative, insulating barrier film apparatus of improved construction. The apparatus preferably includes a first layer of polyester film having a vapor deposited metallic coating thereon. A second layer of film is layered with the first layer, a layer of thermal plastic polymeric adhesive being placed in between the first and second film layers.",
        "The adhesive is preferably a polyester adhesive. The first layer of polyester film is preferably of a thickness of between 0.00044 and 0.00046 inches (0.112 and 0.117 mm).",
        "The vapor deposited metallic coating preferably has a thickness of between about 0.00001 and 0.00050 inches (0.00254 and 0.127 millimeters).",
        "The vapor deposited coating of aluminum preferably has a maximum transmissivity of about 35 percent.",
        "The vapor deposited coating of aluminum preferably has an optical density of between about 2.8 and 3.2.",
        "The second film layer is preferably a low density polyethylene film layer. The second film layer preferably has a thickness of between about 0.0015 and 0.01 inches (0.381 and 2.54 mm).",
        "In a second embodiment, the improved barrier film apparatus of the present invention provides a thermal radiative, insulating barrier film apparatus. The apparatus includes a first layer of polyester film, a vapor deposited coating of aluminum on the first layer of polyester film, and a second layer of film that is a polyethylene film layer.",
        "A third layer of polyethylene foam sheeting is placed in between the first and second film layers wherein the second and third layers are bonded together.",
        "A layer of thermal plastic polymeric adhesive is placed in between the first and second film layers.",
        "The third layer preferably has a thickness of between about 0.001 and 0.005 inches (0.0254 and 0.127 mm).",
        "The second film layer is preferably a low density polyethylene film layer having a thickness of between 0.0010 and 0.0050 inches (0.254 and 1.27 mm).",
        "In a third embodiment, an improved thermal radiative, insulating film barrier apparatus includes a first layer of polyester film, the polyester film layer having a vapor deposited coating of aluminum thereon. The third embodiment includes a second layer of film that is a polyester film layer. A layer of thermal plastic polymeric adhesive is placed in between the first and second film layers.",
        "A fourth embodiment, similar to the third embodiment, further includes an acrylic layer that provides an outer ultraviolet light protective skin to the assembly of the first and second film layers as an optional layer to protect the film apparatus when used in direct sunlight for example.",
        "The acrylic layer preferably has a thickness of between about 5 and 50 microns, more preferably of between about 10 and 30 microns, and most preferably of between about 22 and 25 microns.",
        "The present invention thus provides a layered material for modifying the physical characteristics of packaging and insulation such that the physical principles in which \u201cheat goes to cold\u201d are evaded. The apparatus includes a first metallized heat resistant layer which has highly reflective properties over a large spectrum of radiation. A second layer is provided which retards the transfer of thermal energy by conduction. A third layer can be provided for bonding the first and second layers of material together.",
        "The apparatus of the present invention provides a layered film apparatus that may be processed to form bags, pouches, totes, or other packaging devices without the loss of mechanical integrity of or material characteristics, even when automatic machinery is used in the construction.",
        "The present invention also comprises a method of shipping frozen and/or refrigerated goods which comprises the following steps:\n\n    \n    \n        providing a shipping material as described herein; and\n        placing the goods in a container made of the shipping material; and\n        shipping the goods.\n\nThere is preferably provided a layer which is safe for contact with food adjacent which layer the goods are placed. The method further comprises the step of placing a substance which is colder than the goods in the container with the goods, or the step of placing a means for providing a substance in the container which is colder than the goods in the container (such as a carbon dioxide containing cooling means).",
        "The material of the present invention is preferably rather thin (to allow it to be stored and shipped easily and to take up as little room as possible when used as a packaging and/or insulating material). It preferably has a thickness not greater than 1\u2033 (2.54 cm), more preferably not greater than \u00bd\u2033 (1.27 cm), and most preferably not greater than 1/16\u2033 (0.159 cm). Bags made of the present invention will normally be twice as thick as the material, and thus preferably have a thickness not greater than 2\u2033 (5.08 cm), more preferably not greater than 1\u2033 (2.54 cm), and most preferably not greater than \u215b\u2033 (0.318 cm).",

        "The present inventors have experimented with two industry-standard packing methods and as well, a new product, the bag 20 of the present invention, in a controlled situation, designed to demonstrate differences between each of their efficiencies in delaying the temperature rise of fisheries products. Each of these packing methods has been designed to keep products at cool temperatures and prevent early spoilage while products are being readied for transportation, and, as well, transported via air from Alaska to outside markets.",
        "The first industry-standard packing system (not shown) is a cardboard fibre case with an internal, lidded Styrofoam container of approximately 0.75\u2033 in thickness. A disposable diaper is placed in the bottom of the Styrofoam container and next a thin plastic liner is added. Following this, product and an internal recording thermometer are placed inside the liner which is then folded over the product.

The internal Styrofoam container weighs 0.85 lb. (0.39 kg). The surface area of the fibre case is 10.10 square feet (0.938 square meters).",
        "The second industry standard is the Wetlock case (a wax impregnated bottom and lid\u2014not shown). First a disposable diaper is placed in the case bottom and a thin plastic liner is added. The product and recording thermometer are placed inside the liner, the liner is folded and two 1.5-pound packs of gel ice are placed on top of the folded liner and the top is set in place.

(0.886 kg) without the diaper, liner or gel ice. Its surface area is 6.87 square feet (0.638 square meters).",
        "A third case 60 (see FIGS. 12 and 13) contains the new bag 20 of the present invention and, in our experiments, serves as a comparison of the new methodology with the Styrofoam and the Wetlock packing methods. As before a disposable diaper 30 (FIG. 13) is placed in the bottom of the case 60. Then the bag 20 of the present invention is placed in the case 60. Next a recording thermometer and the product (fish 70) are put in a thin plastic case liner 40, and the case liner 40 is placed in the bag 20 of the present invention. The case liner 40 is folded downward, then two 1.5-pound (0.682 kg) gel ice packs 50 are added on top of case liner 40. The bag 20 of the present invention is then folded down (or otherwise closed, as with double-sided tape, a zip-lock type closure, Velcro\u00ae brand hook-and-loop fastening material, plastic clips, or metal clips).

        "Two experiments are described below. In the first experiment 20 lbs. (9.1 kg) of rockfish fillets were used in each of the three packaging systems. In the second experiment only 19 lbs. (8.64 kg) of rockfish were used, and, in an effort to have near identical starting temperatures, the cases were placed in a blast freezer for four hours prior to the start of the tests. In both experiments, the trials were begun when the three cases were placed side by side on a pallet were they were undisturbed for the duration of the experiment. The first experiment concluded after 46 hours and the second experiment concluded after 60 hours. At the conclusion the recording thermometers were downloaded to a computer application that created graphs of the ambient and internal temperatures of each case. The numerical data were read from the graphs and placed into an MS EXCEL spreadsheet from which new charts and tables were constructed.",
        "Our objective in these studies was to find the comparative likenesses and differences between the three case types and packing systems without seeking absolute conclusions as to the thermodynamics of the three systems.",
        "In CHARTS 1 and 2, graphs of the data in TABLES 1 and 2, represent top to bottom, in degrees Fahrenheit: the ambient temperature, the Wetlock case temperature, the temperature of the bag 20 of the present invention (the \u201cReflectivity Case Temperature\u201d) and, at the bottom, the Styrofoam case temperature.",
        "After an initial period of uncertainty, 4 hours in the first experiment and 6 hours in the second (see CHARTS 1 AND 2), the temperature probes appear to respond consistently and well, and the data from those points forward was used in the analysis of comparative performance. The results of the first four hours of experiment 1 and the first six hours of experiment 2 are ignored in calculating the rates of heat gain in both experiments. In, both experiments (see CHARTS 1 and 2 and TABLES 1 and 2) it is seen that the internal temperatures of the cases containing the bag of the present invention (\u201cReflectivity Case Temperature\u201d in Table 1 and Table 2 and \u201cReflectivity Bag\u201d in Chart 1 and Chart 2) lie between those of the Wetlock cases and the Styrofoam cases, the Styrofoam cases being the bottom graph and the Wetlock graphs being the third from the bottom graphs in the charts.",
        "In the first experiment (see TABLE 1) the rate of change of internal temperature of the case 60 containing the bag 20 of the present invention (the \u201cReflectivity Case Temperature\u201d) and the Styrofoam case per hour and per square foot of surface area, for an elapsed time of 42 hours, beginning at the fourth hour, showed only a small difference (0.027-0.026=0.001). In the second experiment (see TABLE 2), where the experiment continued for 60 hours, the difference (0.047-0.032=0.015), beginning at the sixth hour, at an elapsed time of 42 hours and the difference (0.053-0.036=0.017), again beginning at the sixth hour, at an elapsed time of 54 hours was larger. The Wetlock case, again measured per hour per square foot of surface area, also showed a difference between the two experiments at the elapsed times of 42 hours (0.081-0.042=0.039) and 54 hours (0.071-0.042=0.029). Besides differences in the ambient air temperatures, the experimental conditions contrasted by the one pound difference in the product (20 lbs vs. 19 lbs) between the first and second experiment, and, in the second experiment, to the initial exposure of the open cases to the blast freezer at \u221210 degrees F. for four hours. The data collection in the first experiment continued for 48 hours and in the second experiment extended to 60 hours.",
        "As contrasted with the first experiment, the starting temperatures of the individual cases in the second experiment were similar and lower. There was also a difference between the ambient air temperatures in the first and second experiment. The experiments do not readily allow the separation of the heat gained into the separate classes of conductance, convection and radiation, and in consequence the data is not readily adjustable to reflect the various contributions by the different modes of heat transfer: it is anticipated that future experiments will control the pertinent variables more closely.",
        "The experiments do demonstrate a consistent improvement in performance of the case 60 of the present invention (the \u201cReflectivity Case\u201d) containing the bag 20 of the present invention (the \u201cReflectivity Bag\u201d) over the Wetlock case, and they may demonstrate a close approach to the performance of Styrofoam\u2014it will take several more experiments to determine this. Also, as the data become more reliable analyses by formal methods of linear regression will provide a more exact and reliable comparison of the data.",
        "Styrofoam packaging, especially molded, two-piece styrofoam (the most advantageous styrofoam packaging for optimal insulation) is bulky. There are at least three examples which demonstrate the advantages of insulative packaging made from the material of the present invention as compared to using the more bulky counterpart, styrofoam.",
        "(1) Styrofoam is expensive to transport to the end-user/consumer. For example, it presently costs on the order of $2.25 per two-piece, molded styrofoam box (based on a 50 lb. internal capacity container) to transport one styrofoam two-piece unit from Seattle, Wash. to Anchorage, Ak. In comparison, a bag made from the material of the present invention (based on a 50 lb. internal holding capacity) can be transported, likewise, at a cost on the order of $0.30 per bag.",
        "(2) Styrofoam is expensive to store and warehouse. A single, two-piece molded styrofoam box, which is used to hold 50 lbs. of product, requires approximately 1.8 cubic feet of space. In this same storage space, approximately seventy-five bags 20 of the present invention, each of which can also, eventually, hold 50 lbs. of product, can be stored.",
        "(3) Styrofoam packaging uses up more internal (storage-containment) space, which could otherwise be used to contain more product and/or more coolant (e.g., gel ice, wet ice, etc.). For example, a two-piece molded styrofoam box, which is three-quarters of an inch thick, has an external cubic measurement on the order of 1.8 cubic feet but uses up on the order of 20% of its own internal cubic capacity due to the bulky nature of the styrofoam itself.",

No. 08/781,285 and its corresponding PCT application no. PCT/US97/00473 (published as WO 97/25196 on 17 Jul. 1997), both filed 10 Jan. 1997.",
        "The following are some additions to the invention which the present inventor has made since those patent applications were filed:",
        "1) Closed Cell Foams",
        "With reference to publication no. WO 97/25196, layer 4 (and, possibly, and/or 2) could be closed cell foams, such as polyurethane foams, polyisocyanurate foams, and closed cell foams that are made out of carbon (all of which can be approximately 20-80 mils thick). The closed cell foams that are made out of carbon again add to the thermal qualities and benefits of the MHRP (metallized heat resistant poly bag)\u2014gas injection of the closed cell foams (discussed below) also applies here\u2014the carbon will help in directing the flow of heat/heat transfer away from the contents.",
        "2) Foams should be flexible for packaging use in perishables.",
        "3) Rigid or stiff polymers may be used for some specialized packaging and or structures, dwelling, vehicle applications (mainly in uses where extreme temperatures come into play; some \u201cthermosetting polymers\u201d once formed never burn or melt again)",
        "The following are examples of some rigid or stiff polymers: Bakelite\u00ae (phenolic resin), phenol, and formaldehyde (for non-foodstuffs, industrial use, or automotive use).",
        "4) Closed cell foams are important for the air barrier they supply to retard conduction, but as a secondary use the present inventor wants them also because the air bubbles can be injected with gases that can further add to the thermal protection/longevity of shipping for the product itself (with experimentation of different gases the present inventor believes that one could find a gas that could make the unit self-sufficient not only as just a package but also supplying its own source of cold to feed off of, extending/protecting the perishables; some examples of gases are CO2, C-pentane, nitrogen, hydrogen, etc.",
        "There are many others, and some may be too expensive to utilize at this time. Possible gases to use include noble gases, fluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons. There are a lot of dangerous or toxic gases also, that could be used in a specified need for certain customers.",
        "Kaowool\u2122 brand lightweight porous ceramic insulation can be used in high temperature situations, automotive (racing engines), industrial uses where high temperature comes into play, heat shields, etc. It can be used in place of the foams mentioned above.",
        "Additional applications include:\n\n    (1) Bags to protect kitchen products. Preliminary tests show no freezer burn (after two years). One can put vegetables in a refrigerator in a bag of the present invention for 6-8 weeks with no browning or slime, they continue to look fresh, as do cheeses and meats.\n    (2) Cold shipping\u2014perishables, frozen;\n    (3) Drink containers (e.g., cans, 12 pack box insulation, cartons);\n    (4) Coolers and cooler bags;\n    (5) Insulation of refrigerated trucks;\n    (6) Construction of refrigerators/freezers. A refrigerator/freezer could be made the same outer size as existing refrigerators/freezers but have cubic feet of storage room, smaller compressors, and more energy efficient.\n    (7) Packaging of blood.\n    (8) Packaging of pasteurized goods, milk, etc. (the present invention should extend the shelf life of these products).",
