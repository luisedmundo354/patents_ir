    "abstract": "The invention relates to a method for the contactless measurement of angles or angle modifications, distances or lateral displacements in objects. According to said method, an aperture is transilluminated by means of a ray bundle and after being reflected by a distant reflective element, which generates or is subjected to the angles, angle modifications or lateral displacements that are to be measured, is projected onto a detector surface by an optical system. The image of the aperture on the detector surface is captured, the position of the aperture image is determined in relation to a reference point on the detector surface and the measured value of the angle modification or lateral displacement is calculated using the distance of the centre of the image from the reference point. The invention also relates to an angle or height measuring device.",

        "This application is a continuation application of the international patent application Serial No. PCT/DE2004/001293 filed Jun. 21, 2004, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.",
        "The present invention relates to a method and a device for measuring angles or angle changes on objects.",
        "Measuring systems according to the reflection method, which are used for measuring camber and toe of motor vehicles, are known from Patent Specifications CH 454 477, CH 451 532, and DE 2759 556 C2. In this case, a measuring scale is imaged using a projector over the reflecting surface, which is subjected to the angle change, on a matte disk and/or on a matte disk having optoelectronic converters. The disadvantage in this method is the required fixed reference distance between measuring device and mirror in order to obtain a sharp image on the matte disk, which must be read manually and may not be automated easily. In addition, a special, complex, and costly receiver having the optoelectronic converters and special analysis electronics is necessary for automatic ascertainment of the measured values due to the relatively great enlargement of the image. Furthermore, the number and size (packing density) of the optoelectronic converters are limited, so that the resolution and measuring range are too low for most applications.",
        "Furthermore, determining angles or angle changes in a contactless way with the aid of an autocollimation telescope, in which a suitable projected object (typically crosshairs) is evaluated after reflection on a reflecting surface subjected to the angle change with the aid of a beam splitter and an objective acting as the collimator and telescope, is generally known in principle. Corresponding embodiments are known in, among other things, DE 33 11 945 A1, DE 197 41 290 A1, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,513,000. Instead of crosshairs, a pin diaphragm is positioned as the object in DE 197 41 290 A1. A disadvantage in these arrangements is that with increasing measurement distance, i.e., as the distance becomes greater between mirror and autocollimator, the angle measurement range is reduced because of shadowing through screen effects. The problem is known and/or described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,513,000. The autocollimator contains two switchable light sources therein, which are laterally offset within the object plane and thus allow two small measuring ranges. The problem in this case is that continuous measurement within a large measuring range is not possible. Furthermore, a system having collimator and telescope at an acute angle, in which a punctual light source functions as the object generator, is known from U.S. Pat. No. 5,883,709. However, this system also functions for large angles up to 30\u00b0 only at very small distances between test object and receiver system, since the lens opening of the receiver collimator also vignettes and also does not solve the problems described above.",
        "Amongst other things, it may be an object of the invention to provide a method and/or an associated measuring device whose angle measuring range is greater than that of typical methods, a sufficient angle measuring range to be provided even at larger distances between measuring object and measuring arrangement, which provides linearly proportional measured values even in the event of different measurement distances. In addition, the analysis is to be able to be performed automatically.",

        "The screen may be designed in such a way that it has two or more openings positioned in a suitable way, whose geometries are known and which allow exact determination of the screen image size on the detector. The imaging scale may be ascertained via the determination of the screen image size and wherein the focal intercept and the measurement distance respectively may be determined via the known focal width of the optical system.",
        "The reflecting element may be implemented as a retroreflector. The retroreflector may be an optical square which is inclination-invariant in only one plane. The retroreflector may be a triple mirror or corner cube, which is inclination-invariant in two planes. Lateral displacements may be measured via the angle measurement and the distance ascertained between reflector and device via the tangential relationship.",
        "In the following, exemplary embodiments of the present invention are explained in greater detail on the basis of the attached drawing in which:",
        "FIG. 1 shows a schematic view of a first exemplary embodiment of the measuring device according to the present invention;",
        "FIG. 2 shows a second exemplary embodiment of the measuring device according to the present invention;",
        "FIG. 3 shows a third exemplary embodiment of the measuring device according to the present invention;",
        "FIG. 4 shows the beam path upon imaging of the screen at an angle \u03b1=0\u00b0 to the reflecting surface;",
        "FIG. 5 shows the beam path upon imaging of the screen at an angle \u03b1\u22600\u00b0 to the reflecting surface;",
        "FIG. 6 shows the image of the screen position at an angle \u03b1=0\u00b0 to the reflecting surface viewed from the detector;",
        "FIG. 7 shows the image of the screen position at an angle \u03b1\u22600\u00b0 to the reflecting surface viewed from the detector; and",
        "FIG. 8 shows the arrangement having a retroreflector as the reflecting element for measuring lateral displacements.",
        "In the method according to the present invention, a beam bundle is used which originates from a homogeneously illuminated planar radiation field and transilluminates the screen uniformly. Optical, incoherent radiation may be used as the radiation, visible, monochromatic light between 400 and 780 nm in the exemplary embodiment, IR, UV, and the entire further range of the electromagnetic spectrum from gamma radiation via x-ray radiation up to microwave radiation also being conceivable. Furthermore, monochromatic and/or coherent or partially coherent radiation sources are also conceivable.",
        "The screen is subsequently first imaged on a reflecting surface subjected to the angle change at the imaging scale 1 and subsequently the virtual image of the screen arising at double the distance from screen to reflecting surface is imaged via the optical system on a detector surface.",
        "The present invention is based on the idea of analyzing a lateral screen image displacement on a detector which is proportional to the angle change of the reflecting element and determining the precise absolute value and the direction (sign) in relation to a prior position or a reference position (null position).",
        "In this type of analysis according to the present invention, the vignetting through finite limited lens openings, which is problematic in normal autocollimation methods, may be used, and precisely this vignetting screen may be imaged and/or analyzed. In this case, the beam bundles contributing to the image of the screen are used, which encloses the beam bundle containing the main beam, which is incident exactly perpendicularly on the reflecting surface subjected to the angle change, in an angularly symmetric way.",
        "The beam bundles which contribute to the imaging of the screen but are not incident perpendicularly on the mirror also contain main beams which enclose the perpendicular main beam in a rotationally symmetric/angularly symmetric way, in each case by the angle corresponding to the imaged screen size.",
        "In this case, practically all beams contributing to the imaging of the screen pass through the imaging optical system again, independently of the measurement distance, so that no light losses occur.",
        "Those quasi-parallel beam bundles whose main beams have an angle to the actual, perpendicular main beam greater than the angle corresponding to the imaged screen size do not pass through and/or no longer pass through the optical system and do not contribute to the imaging.",
        "The beam bundles described originate from neighboring light points within the planar splitter, which enclose the light point lying on the perpendicular main beam in a point-symmetric way.",
        "A circular screen may be used as the screen shape, other shapes such as elliptical, square, rectangular, or other arbitrary geometric shapes also being conceivable, however.",
        "The screen diameter and the minimum distance between screen and reflecting surface may be tailored to one another, so that the measuring range and resolution may be optimized.",
        "The reflecting element may be implemented as a mirror, but other surfaces which sufficiently reflect the beam bundle, such as uncoated glass surfaces or surfaces of liquids, are also possible. The test object itself may also act as a reflecting element. This may be the case, for example, in the testing of the surface geometry of optical lens surfaces, optical mirrors, silicon wafer disks, or other surfaces reflecting the radiation, as in the testing of the angle and angular deviation of optical flats and wedges, prisms, and optical squares of different constructions.",
        "The reflecting element is expediently implemented as a planar mirror, which is subjected to a specific flatness requirement in accordance with the required measurement precision and/or permissible measurement uncertainty. However, other mirror geometries are also conceivable.",
        "Furthermore, an element which has a correspondingly structured surface as a diffraction grating, for example, may be used as the reflecting element. The diffraction angles are given for a fixed grating according to the grating constants and the wavelength of the radiation. Corresponding integral multiples of the diffraction angle are reflected in each case for the different orders of diffraction, which may be partially detected by the device within its measurement range. Arbitrary gratings having greatly varying glancing and diffraction angles are conceivable. In a exemplary embodiment, the diffraction grating is designed in such a way that the diffraction angle of the grating is just slightly smaller than the single, entire measurement range of the device (having a normal reflector and/or planar mirror; without diffraction grating). In the limiting range, i.e., in the event of an angle change of the reflector beyond the limits of the measuring range, before leaving the radiation surface of the corresponding order of diffraction, the beam bundle of the next order of diffraction is imaged on the detector and detected as an angle measured value. Upon the transition from one detected order of diffraction to the next, the detector will typically detect 2 measured points. The difference ascertained and/or the distance of the two measured points is taken into consideration as the offset in the analysis.",
        "Therefore, for example, the double, triple, and further integral multiples of the original angle value may also be detected with the precision and resolution remaining uniform. The grating is typically applied to a planar glass surface. However, geometries other than planar geometries are also possible. In addition, further materials such as plastics, metals, and other materials are also conceivable.",
        "The detector which detects the image of the screen may be implemented as an optoelectronic receiver such as a quadrant diode, a position-sensitive lateral effect diode (PSD), or a CCD line and/or preferably a CCD area sensor, automatic analysis able to be performed using a downstream analysis electronics system or a PC.",
        "Furthermore, the position of the screen image may also be analyzed visually via an ocular having corresponding aids such as ocular measuring marks or an ocular micrometer.",
        "In another exemplary embodiment of the method, in the step of transillumination, a quasi-parallel or approximately quasi-parallel beam bundle is used. This may make possible that practically all beams which contribute to the imaging of the screen are reflected parallel from the planar mirror again and all beams pass through the screen into the optical system, so that no light losses and, above all, no light strength changes occur on the detector at different measurement distances (between screen and mirror and/or mirror and optical system).",
        "The quasi-parallel or approximately quasi-parallel beam bundle is generated by a radiation source in the object-side focal point and/or in proximity to the focal point of the optical system, the beams coming from a finite area of an optical system enclosing the focal point within the focal plane and/or being generated in such a way that they appear to come from this area.",
        "In an advantageous practical embodiment, a single optical system having a beam splitter between the illumination and/or detector and optical system is used. The optical system simultaneously assumes the function of the transillumination of the screen with quasi-parallel radiation and the function of imaging the screen on the detector. In this type of arrangement, the illuminated screen is simultaneously the aperture screen of the imaging system.",
        "Alternatively, a divided 2-part optical system may also be used, in which two optical systems are positioned at an angle 0\u00b0<\u03c6<90\u00b0 or an angle \u03c6=90\u00b0 to an additional beam splitter between the first optical system and the reflecting element.",
        "In a further exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the screen may be positioned in the image-side focal point of the optic in order to obtain a telecentric beam path during the step of imaging, which may be useful if different image distances result through different measurement distances, which may not or are not to be refocused.",
        "The measuring device for contactless measurement of angles or angle changes on an object contains a radiation source for generating a beam bundle, a downstream screen which is transilluminated by the beam bundle, a downstream reflecting element at a predefined measurement distance, which is subjected to the angle change to be measured, an optical system which generates the screen image from the beam bundle reflected back, an optoelectronic detector on which the screen image is projected, and a downstream electronic analysis unit, the analysis unit being set up to determine the position of the screen image to a prior reference position and to a reference point respectively, in order to obtain therefrom the measured value of the angle and the angle change respectively.",
        "In another embodiment, the analysis unit is set up in such a way that it automatically ascertains the center point of the screen image on the basis of its brightness distribution. However, the edges of the screen image may also be ascertained and analyzed in the same way.",
        "In a variation of the analysis unit, the center point of the screen image may also be ascertained automatically on the basis of its centroid.",
        "For certain applications, for example, at small distances and/or with long objective focal widths (for extremely high resolutions and precisions), it has been shown to be possible for the screen to have a variable screen opening in order to allow adaptation of the size of the screen image on the detector corresponding to the predefined measurement distance.",
        "In a special variation, the optical system may be adjustable in the direction of the optical axis in order to focus the screen image on the detector. In this case, the contrast and/or the transition of the intensity curve between the bright and dark components of the screen image may be adapted to correspond to the requirements, fuzzy images also able to be useful in some cases. Instead of the displacement of the optical system, the detector may also be positioned displaceably in order to focus the screen image, of course.",
        "In another embodiment, the screen, the optical system, the reflecting element, and the detector may be positioned on one axis, for a beam splitter to be positioned on this axis between screen and detector, and for the radiation source to emit the beam bundle for illuminating the screen into the beam splitter transversely to this axis. A simple, compact, and cost-effective construction may be implemented in this way, in which the illumination of the screen and its imaging may be performed using a single optical element and/or system.",
        "In another variation of the present invention, it has resulted that a monochromatic light source is provided as the radiation source.",
        "In addition, a filter element may be provided in the beam path which filters out the interference radiation from the surroundings. It is may be favorable in this case if the monochromatic radiation of the radiation source is transmitted well by the filter provided, which filters out the interfering light of the environment.",
        "Another embodiment of the measuring device has a light-scattering element in the beam path between radiation source and screen. This light-scattering element may be implemented as a scattering disk, diffuser, and/or opal disk and allows a corresponding design of the light density distribution of the planar radiator.",
        "Otherwise, planar radiators or lights having corresponding light density distributions or display illuminations having absorption patterns which may be generated are also conceivable in the illumination plane in order to compensate for specific properties (e.g., the distortion of an objective) or to generate specific characteristics.",
        "Furthermore, instead of subjecting the reflecting surface to the angle changes to be measured, the method may also be used in the reverse sense, in that the measuring device is subjected to the angle changes to be measured in relation to the fixed reflecting surface. For example, the measuring device may be used in order to measure large, heavy mirrors, glass blocks, or liquid surfaces in such a way that the measuring device is pivoted and/or slanted exactly around one or even two orthogonal axes and the measured angle change is related to the angular inclination introduced, the difference is calculated, and the formal deviation may be determined.",
        "In a further application, the reflecting element may be an optical element comprising at least two optical surfaces, which are known as optical flats and wedges, prisms, or optical squares, for example. In this case, an image of the screen is imaged on the detector by both reflecting surfaces and the distance of the image points is ascertained as the angular difference, taking the refractive index and/or corresponding factors into consideration. Optical wedges having up to 40\u00b0 refractive index may thus typically be ascertained. In addition, optical squares or prisms having deflection angles of 180\u00b0 minus maximum angle measuring range \u03b1max of the arrangement and/or the angular deviations of prisms 90\u00b0-\u03b1max and, with a corresponding arrangement, also deviations of 45\u00b0-optical squares may be ascertained.",
        "In a further exemplary application, optical wedges and prism surfaces\u2014when the surfaces have been well coated with an antireflection material, for example\u2014may also be measured in transmission against a planar mirror. In this case, the test object is laid laterally from the optical axis on a mirror or laid on a holding device between mirror and measuring system. The two beam bundles which are incident perpendicularly on the mirror (a) direct beam bundle from the measurement arrangement b) beam bundle deflected by the test object) are imaged and generate a \u201cdouble point\u201d on the detector, whose distance is analyzed and results in the angle measured value.",
        "In a further embodiment, a suitable \u201cmultiple prism\u201d having appropriately stepped wedge sectors may also be used in this way, so that a simple pupil division is possible, using which test objects such as lenses and optical systems may be checked and measured with the aid of a mirror or with the aid of a CCD camera in a telescope arrangement for wave front quality in transmission or for coating dimensions.",
        "In addition, a double image made of two fixed, illuminated area sections at an angle \u03b1 to one another may be generated and analyzed on an optical lens or mirrors surface having weak curvature. By changing the measurement distance, the surface inclination angle as a function of the distance and therefore to the sampling diameter on the reflecting surface may be determined. After a subsequent computing operation, the surface geometry may be determined. Simultaneously, the deviation of the two screen images to the fixed reference point may be analyzed as a centering error in this method. With strongly curved optical surfaces, preferably aspheric surfaces, these may also be analyzed with the aid of upstream (focusing) optics.",
        "Furthermore, the system may also be used to the leveling over water in an air or water vehicle by orienting the device perpendicularly to the water surface and determining the angular position to a reference point and/or to a reference axis.",
        "In specific cases, it may be necessary or favorable to determine the measured distance between measuring device and reflecting element. For this purpose, the imaging scale may be calculated via the known size of the screen and the size of the screen image, and thus the distance may be calculated if the focal width of the optical system is known.",
        "In a special application of the arrangement as a measuring method, a single-axis optical square or a double-axis retroreflector may be used as the reflecting element. Optical squares and/or retroreflectors (triple mirrors and/or corner cubes) have the property of reflecting incident beam bundles one-dimensionally and/or two-dimensionally in the direction from which they came. With the aid of such an element, it is thus possible to detect corresponding beam bundles in such a way that the tilting (for one-dimensional optical squares) does not result or not only the tilting results in an angle or an angle change ascertained on the detector, but rather a lateral displacement of the element.",
        "For example, with a known focal intercept s (equal to the distance between measuring device and reflecting element=measurement distance), the desired value for a lateral displacement x and/or delta x may be calculated from this measured angle via a tangent function.",
        "Using the present invention, automatic alignment measurements may be performed according to the height method. In most cases of the application according to the present invention, the distances may be fixed sufficiently precisely or determined in another way.",
        "However, it is also possible to determine the measured distance s between measuring device and reflecting element in such a way that the imaging scale is ascertained via the known size of the screen and the size of the screen image measured on the detector. The distance s may be determined via the known focal width of the optical system and the imaging scale.",
        "In another embodiment, the screen is not circular and/or single-surface, but rather divided in two by a web in the middle, for example, so that one light point does not result as the image on the detector, but rather two crescent-shaped areas. The advantage in this case is that the rising and falling slopes do not provide the image diameter, which results in, among other things, faulty determination of the imaging scale in the event of critical conditions such as saturation of the detector, but rather this diameter may be determined exactly via the center points and/or centroids of the crescent areas. Of course, other screen geometries are also conceivable in addition, such as those having square or rectangular boundaries and webs or having 2 circular screen openings. The screens may additionally be divided not only into two parts, but rather also into multiple parts, if they permit a corresponding imaging through the retroreflectors described.",
        "FIG. 1 shows a preferred example of the device according to the present invention, the beam bundle 1 entering the overall optical system via a beam splitter 3 after originating from a radiation source 2, being deflected by 90\u00b0, and transilluminating the screen 4. On the reflecting element 5, which is subjected to the angle changes and which is preferably implemented as a planar mirror, the beam bundle per se is reflected and imaged on the detector 7 via the optical system 6 after passing through the beam splitter 3 again.",
        "A second exemplary embodiment is shown in FIG. 2, in which the beam splitter 3 is seated essentially in the quasi-parallel beam path instead of in the divergent beam path. The screen 4 is positioned between beam splitter 3 and mirror 5, it also being able to be positioned between a further optical system 8 and the beam splitter. In the first case, the screen is then typically a field screen and aperture screen at the same time. In the second case, it is only a field screen.",
        "A third exemplary embodiment is shown in FIG. 3, in which the optical system 6 and a further optical system 8 are positioned at an angle \u03c6 and the screen 4 functions purely as a field screen.",
        "In FIG. 4, the beam bundle 1 is schematically shown originating from a point P\u2033 on the light surface 2b illuminated by a radiation source 2a, which contributes to the imaging of the point P of the screen in the image point P\u2033 if mirror surface 5 is perpendicular. The neighboring light points O1\u2033 and O2\u2033 (edge of the entrance pupil) on the lighted surface 2b contribute for this purpose to the screen edge (O1 and/or O1\u2032 and O2 and/or O2\u2032) being imaged in the screen edge image points O1\u2033 and/or O2\u2033 (edge of the exit pupil) on the detector 7. The intensity of the brightness distribution within the screen image on the detector is determined by the totality of the neighboring points in their light density on the light field. These points lie rotationally symmetrically around the point P1\u2033, between the points P\u2033 and On\u2033 (with 1<n<\u221e) and are imaged in the screen image plane.",
        "FIG. 5 schematically shows the beam path when mirror surface 5 is inclined by the angle \u03b1. The main beam originating from point P and/or P\u2032 is perpendicular to the mirror surface 5 and also encloses the angle \u03b1 to the optical axis. The image of the screen (exit pupil) is laterally displaced in this case within the image plane and/or detector plane 7. The light field within the light surface 2b contributing to this image, the entrance pupil, is also laterally displaced.",
        "FIG. 6 schematically shows the example of the screen image on the detector when the mirror is perpendicular to the optical axis and/or the angle \u03b1=0\u00b0, as shown in FIG. 4.",
        "FIG. 7 schematically shows the example of the screen image on the detector when the mirror is inclined by an angle \u03b1\u22600\u00b0 in relation to the optical axis, as shown in FIG. 5. The displacement of the screen position may now be ascertained in relation to the starting position and/or reference position from FIG. 6 and the angle change, which is approximately proportional to the displacement of the screen position, may be determined automatically therefrom.",
        "FIG. 8 schematically shows the arrangement having a reflecting element (5), which is implemented as a single-axis optical square or a double-axis retroreflector, with the aid of which one-dimensional or two-dimensional lateral displacements x and/or delta x may be ascertained."
