        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a digital communication system, and more particularly, to a vestigial sideband (VSB) modulation transmission system including a TCM (Trellis-Coded Modulation) encoder and an additional \u00bd rate convolutional encoder having a superior state transition property when connected to the TCM encoder in the system.",
        "2. Background of the Related Art",
        "The TCM coded 8-VSB modulation transmission system has been selected as a standard in 1995 for the U.S. digital terrestrial television broadcasting, and the actual broadcasting incorporating the system has started since the second half of the year 1998.",
        "In general, a digital communication system performs error correcting processes to correct the errors occurred at the communication channels. The total amount of the transmitting data is increased by such error correcting coding processes since it creates additional redundancy bits added to the information bits. Therefore, the required bandwidth is usually increased when using an identical modulation technique. Trellis-coded modulation (TCM) combines multilevel modulation and coding to achieve coding gain without bandwidth expansion. Also an improved signal to noise ratio can be achieved by using the trellis-coded modulation (TCM) technique.",
        "FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B illustrate a typical TCM encoder used in a typical ATSC 8-VSB system and corresponding set partitions used by the TCM encoder. According to the FIG. 1A, an input bit d0 is output as c1 and c0 after trellis-coded modulation, and then a subset is selected among (\u22127,1), (\u22125,3), (\u22123,5), and (\u22121,7). Thereafter, an input bit d1 selects a signal within the selected subset. In other words, when d1 and d0 are inputted, one of eight signals (\u22127,\u22125,\u22123,\u22121,1,3,5,7) is selected by c2, c1, and c0 generated by the TCM encoder. d1 and d0 are called an uncoded bit and a coded bit, respectively.",
        "FIG. 1B illustrates the set partitions used by the TCM encoder used in the ATSC 8-VSB system. Eight signal levels are divided into four subsets, each of which including two signal levels. Two signals are assigned to each subset such that the signal levels of each subset are as far as possible from each other as shown in FIG. 1B.",
        "Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a VSB transmission system and a method for encoding an input signal in the VSB transmission system that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.",
        "An object of the present invention is to provide a VSB transmission system that can transmit data reliably even at a lower signal to noise ratio and can have an optimal state transition property when connected to the TCM encoder by using a \u00bd rate convolutional encoder as an additional error correcting encoder in the system.",

        "In another aspect of the present invention, a vestigial sideband (VSB) modulation transmission system includes a \u00bd rate convolutional encoder encoding an input signal to generate first and second output signals; a \u2154 rate trellis-coded modulation (TCM) encoder encoding the first and second output signals to generate third, forth and fifth output signals; and a signal mapper mapping the third, forth, and fifth output signals.",
        "There are three different types of \u00bd rate convolutional encoders that can be used in this aspect of the present invention.

        "FIG. 2 illustrates a VSB transmission system in which an error correcting encoder is concatenated to a \u2154 rate TCM encoder according to the present invention. By adding an additional error correcting encoder to the \u2154 rate TCM encoder in the VSB system, it is possible to achieve a reliable data transmission even at a lower signal to noise ratio than that of the conventional ATSC TCM coded 8VSB system. In the present invention, a \u00bd rate convolutional encoder is used for the additional error correcting encoder. In addition, a multiplexer located between the error correcting encoder and the \u2154 rate TCM encoder classifies the data received from each of the error correcting encoder and a ATSC encoder and inputs each data to the TCM encoder. The additional error-corrected data will be regarded as an error by the ATSC receiver and will be discarded.",
        "FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate a \u00bd rate encoder used as an additional error correcting encoder shown in FIG. 2. According to FIG. 3A, an input bit u is processed in the \u00bd rate encoder to generate two output bits d1 and d0, and these are inputted to a \u2154 rate TCM encoder. In FIG. 3B, each of \u2154 and \u2153 rate encoders is connected to a \u2154 mate TCM encoder. Since the bit error rate of uncoded bits u1 is lower than that of a coded bit u0, the encoder having a higher code rate is used for u1, and the other encoder is used for u0. This will compensate the difference between two input bits u0 and u1. In addition, the \u2154 and \u2153 rate encoders can be considered as being a \u00bd rate encoder since it has three input bits and six output bits. Thus, combining encoders having different code rates can reduce the bit error rate of the whole system. As a result, the additional encoder can be any one of the \u00bd rate encoder and the combination of the \u2154 rate encoder and the \u2153 rate encoder shown in FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B, respectively. By adding the additional encoder, the performance of the system can be enhanced, and this will be shown later in this section. Considering the signal mapping of the TCM encoder, the error correcting encoder must be designed so that it has the optimal state transition property when connected to the TCM encoder.",
        "FIG. 4 illustrates a first type of a \u00bd rate convolutional encoder concatenated to a \u2154 TCM encoder in a VSB transmission system according to the present invention. The \u00bd rate convolutional encoder receives an input bit u and generates a first output bit d1 by bypassing u. A second output bit d0 is the value of the N+1 th memory mi+1. The \u00bd rate convolutional encoder includes N multipliers, N adders, and N+1 memories. The first memory m1 stores a previous second output value, the first multiplier g1 multiplies the input bit u by a first constant k1, and the first adder adds the outputs from g1 and m1. Similarly, each i+1 th memory mi+1 stores the output from the ith adder, the ith multiplier gi multiplies the input bit u by an ith constant ki, and the ith adder adds the outputs from gi and mi, where i=2,3,4, . . . ,N . Finally, the N+1th memory mi+1 stores the output from the N th adder. Then the value stored in mi+1 is output as a second output bit (current). In addition, the second output bit (current) is feedback to the first memory m1 for calculating a next second output value. N can be greater than or equal to two and can be determined as one wishes to design the system. As shown in the FIG. 4, the \u00bd rate convolutional encoder receives u and outputs d0 and d1.d0 and d1 then become the output bits c1 and c2 of the TCM encoder. Therefore, when d1d0=00, c2c1=00, and the corresponding 8VSB symbol becomes 7(c2c1c0=000) or \u22125 (c2c1c0=001) depending on the value of c0.c0 is equal to the value stored in a second memory s1 and is obtained by adding s0 and d0, where s0 is the value stored in a first memory. The 8VSB symbols for d1d0=01, 10, 11 are (\u22123,\u22121), (1,3), and (5,7), respectively.",
        "FIG. 5A illustrates a non-systematic \u00bd-rate convolutional encoder used in a VSB system according to the present invention and its corresponding state transition diagram. This type of encoder is often used because of its long free-distance property. In the state transition diagram shown in FIG. 5A, a transition from the state Sk at t=k to the state Sk+1 at t=k+1 is denoted as a branch, and the value indicated above each branch corresponds to the output of the branch.

        "As shown in the state transition diagram of FIG. 5A, two branches are divided from each Sk, and two branches are merged into, each Sk+1. A viterbi decoder that decodes a convolutional code first calculates the path metrics of the two paths that are merging into each state and selects the path having a lower path metric. The path metric selected using this technique represents the lowest path metric of the paths starting from an initial state (t=0) to each Sk.",
        "When selecting a path between two paths merging into one state, the probability of the path selection becomes higher as the difference between the metrics of the two paths is larger. Since a path metric represents the sum of metrics of the branches included in a path, it is desired to have the largest difference between the branch metrics in order to maximize the performance of the encoder.",
        "The \u00bd rate convolutional encoder shown in FIG. 5A includes a first memory for storing an input bit u as a first memory value s0; a second memory for storing s0 as a second memory value s1; a first adder for adding u and s1; and a second adder for adding u, s0, and s1. The output from the first and second adders becomes a first output bit d1 and a second output bit d0.",
        "FIG. 5B illustrates a systematic convolutional encoder used in a VSB transmission system and its corresponding state transition diagram. A first output bit d1 is generated by bypassing an input bit u, and a second output bit d0 is generated by adding and delaying u. The systematic \u00bd rate convolutional encoder includes a first memory for storing a previous second output bit value as a first memory value s0, an adder for adding the input bit u and s0, and a second memory for storing the output from the adder as a second memory value s1 and outputting s1 as the second output bit d0.",
        "According to FIG. 5A, the combination of the branch outputs dividing from a state at t=k or merging into a state at t=k+1 is (00,11) or (01,10). According to the trellis-coded modulation fundamental, the encoder has a better performance as the difference between branch metrics of the combination is larger. A larger difference between the branch metrics means that the corresponding Euclidean distance is larger. The Euclidean distance of (00,11) is larger than that of (01,10). When the output is either 01 or 10, the error often occurs during the path selection. Therefore, it is desired to have, the combination of the branch outputs of (00,10) and (01,11) so that the difference between the branch metrics is large. This is shown in FIG. 5B. Therefore, the convolutional encoder of FIG. 5B has a better encoding performance than that of FIG. 5A.",

        "FIG. 7A and FIG. 7B illustrate Euclidean distances corresponding to the output combinations generated from the encoders shown in FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B, respectively. As it can be shown from both figures, the Euclidean distances of (00,10) and (01,11) are much larger than the that of (01,10). Therefore, the convolutional encoder of FIG. 5B has a better performance when connected to the \u2154 rate TCM encoder in the VSB transmission system.",
        "FIG. 8 illustrates performances of ATSC 8-VSB transmission systems when each of the convolutional encoders shown in FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B is used in the system. For a bit error rate of 1 e\u22123, the signal to noise ratio is reduced by 2 dB and 4 dB when the convolutional encoders shown in FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B are used as an additional error-correcting encoder in the VSB system. Therefore, a bit error rate can be reduced by using a \u00bd rate convolutional encoder as an outer encoder of the TCM encoder, and the encoder shown in FIG. 5B has a better bit error rate reduction property.",
        "In conclusion, data can be transmitted at a lower signal to noise ratio by concatenating a \u00bd rate convolutional encoder to the TCM encoder in a VSB transmission system according the present invention.",

The description of the present invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims. Many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art."
