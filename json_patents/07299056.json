        "This invention relates to vehicular navigation based on site specific sensor quality data.",
        "Location sensing devices include odometers, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and vision-based triangulation systems, for example. Many location sensing devices are subject to errors (e.g., measurement error) in providing an accurate location estimate over time and different geographic positions. The error in the location estimate may vary with the type of location sensing device. Odometers are subject to material errors from slipping or sliding over a surface terrain. For example, wheel or tire slippage may cause the odometer to estimate an erroneous location for a corresponding vehicle. A Global Positioning System (GPS) may suffer from errors or lack of availability because one or more satellite transmissions are attenuated or reflected by buildings, trees, hills, terrain or other obstructions. Vision based triangulation systems may experience error over certain angular ranges and distance ranges because of the relative position of cameras and landmarks. Thus, there is a need to improve the accuracy and the availability of location sensing devices for a vehicle to facilitate accurate navigation of the vehicle within a work area.",

A reception quality estimator estimates reception quality data for the corresponding reception location data for the first cell. Optical location data is determined within a first cell of a work area for a vehicle. An optical quality estimator estimates optical quality data for the corresponding optical location data for the first cell. A data processor selects at least one of the reception location data, the optical location data, and other location data as refined location data associated with the first cell based on the estimated reception quality data and estimated optical quality data.",

        "In accordance with one embodiment, FIG. 1 shows a system 11 for determining a location of a vehicle based on site specific sensor quality data. The system 11 comprises a location-sensing system 10 coupled to a vehicular controller 44. A path planning module 42 may provide a path plan or other navigation-related input data to the vehicular controller 44. The obstacle detection system 52 may provide navigation-related input on stationary or moving objects within a work area (e.g., to avoid collisions with such objects). In turn, the vehicular controller 44 may communicate with (e.g., issue control data or signals to) one or more of the following: a steering system 46, a braking system 48, and a propulsion system 50.",
        "In one embodiment, the location sensing system 10 comprises a location-determining receiver 12, an optical location determining system 14, and a dead-reckoning system 16 that are coupled to a quality estimation module 20. The location determining receiver 12, the optical location determining system 14, and the dead-reckoning system 16 may be collectively referred to as location sensors. Any of the location sensors may be referred to individually as a location sensor.",
        "The location determining receiver 12 may comprise a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver with differential correction, or another receiver for receiving electromagnetic energy from transmitters (e.g., terrestrial or satellite beacons) to determine a location (e.g., in two dimensional or three dimensional coordinates) of the vehicle. The location-determining receiver 12 (e.g., GPS receiver) communicates to a reception quality estimator 22; the optical location-determining receiver 12 (e.g., vision-based triangulation system) communicates to an optical quality estimator 23; and the dead-reckoning system 16 (e.g., differential odometer) communicates with a dead-reckoning quality estimator 24. The location-determining receiver 12 outputs reception location data 26. Reception location data may also be referred to as primary location data, whereas all other location data from location sensors (e.g., of the location-sensing system 10) may be referred to as secondary location data (e.g., optical location data, odometer location data, radio frequency ranging location data, gyro location data, magnetometer location data, and accelerometer location data).",
        "The optical location-determining system 14 outputs optical location data 28. The optical location-determining system 14 may comprise a laser system, a scanning laser system, a ladar (e.g. laser radar) system, a laser range finder, a stereo vision system, a monocular vision system, a machine vision system, or the like. The optical location-determining system may operate over the humanly visible light spectrum, infra-red, near-infra-red or ultraviolet light spectrum, for example.",
        "In an alternate embodiment, the optical location-determining system 14 may be replaced by a terrestrial or local radio frequency (RF) ranging system that estimates the location of a vehicle by measuring the time of arrival, the angle of arrival or both of a radio frequency signal transmitted from one or more fixed or known locations within a maximum radius of the work area. Accordingly, if the optical location determining system 14 is replaced by a local radio frequency ranging system, the optical location data is replaced with radio frequency (RF) location data.",
        "In general, the dead-reckoning system 16 comprises a displacement sensor and a heading sensor. The displacement sensor measures the relative displacement of the vehicle, whereas the heading sensor measures the relative heading. The dead-reckoning system 16 outputs dead-reckoning location data 30. The dead-reckoning location data may provide a traveled distance of the vehicle, a traveled direction of the vehicle, traveled distance versus time (e.g., vehicular speed), or vehicular velocity (e.g., speed and heading).",
        "In one embodiment, the dead-reckoning system 16 comprises an odometer as the displacement sensor and a gyroscope (e.g., a fiberoptic gyroscope) as the heading sensor. The odometer may directly or indirectly count wheel revolutions or fractions thereof, of one or more wheels associated with the vehicle. The gyroscope may provide vehicle direction information or heading information.",
        "In alternate embodiments the dead-reckoning system 16 may comprise one or more of the following: a wheel revolution counter, an integrator associated with a speed sensor, an integrator associated with a radar system, a gyro, a fiberoptic gyroscope, a vibration gyroscope, a magnetometer, and an accelerometer. The output of an accelerometer may be double-integrated to determine displacement, for example.",
        "The optical location-determining system 14 may comprise a plurality of cameras mounted around a perimeter of the work area or inside the work area to determine vehicle location from stereo vision information, for example. If the cameras are mounted on or near a perimeter of the work area, rather than on the vehicle itself, the optical location-determining system 14 may be considered an \u201coutside-looking-in\u201d system.",
        "The dead-reckoning location data 30 may comprise a covered distance and a corresponding heading of the vehicle. In one embodiment, the dead-reckoning system 16 may use an optical or magnetic source coupled to a rotational member (e.g., a wheel, or shaft in the drive train) that emits an optical signal or magnetic field, which is sensed by a sensor to determine the amount of revolutions or fractional revolutions of a wheel of the vehicle. The revolutions of the wheel may be converted into estimated distance. In other embodiments, an odometer or other component of the dead-reckoning system may be mechanically coupled to a rotational member of a drive train or a wheel. Because the dead-reckoning error (e.g., approximately equal to ten (10) percent) of the dead-reckoning system 16 may be greater than that of radar system (e.g., typical error less than three percent) or a location-determining receiver, the dead-reckoning system 16 may be supplemented with readings from a radar system, a location-determining receiver, and an accelerometer to estimate velocity of the vehicle, position of the vehicle, or both.",
        "The quality estimation module 20 outputs one or more of the following quality data to a data processor 38: reception quality data 32, optical quality data 34, and dead-reckoning quality data 36. The reception quality data 32 may vary with the vehicle location of the vehicle in the work area. The optical quality data 34 may vary with the vehicle location of the vehicle in the work area. The dead-reckoning quality data 36 (e.g., odometer quality data and gyroscope quality data) may vary with the vehicle location of the vehicle in the work area. The reception quality estimator 22 estimates or determines reception quality data 32 (e.g., Dilution of Precision (DOP) data); the optical quality estimator 23 estimates or determines optical quality data 34 (e.g., Dilution of Precision or a figure of merit for the reported position based on at least one of technical specifications of a vision sensor of the optical location determining system 14, an observed scene for the first cell, and an imaging processing algorithm for the optical location data.); and the odometer quality estimator 24 estimates or determines dead-reckoning quality data 36.",
        "To create site specific error data for each location sensor, the location sensors may take a number of samples of reception location data 26, optical location data 28, and dead-reckoning location data 30 for known or verifiable locations within the work area (e.g., within all cells of a work area and for each location sensor). Error levels, availability, or reliability levels (e.g. in percentage terms) may be determined for respective coordinates within the work area by comparing the measured location of each location sensor to the known or verifiable location. The error level data, availability data or reliability data may be expressed as quality data. For example, the reception quality data 32 may comprise Dilution of Precision (DOP). The quality estimation module 20 may facilitate the storage of site-specific error data for each location sensor (e.g., location determining receiver 12, optical location-determining system 14, and dead-reckoning system 16) for the vehicle in the data storage device 39.",
        "Dilution of Precision (DOP) is an indicator of the quality of a position data (e.g., GPS position data) which considers the relative locations of satellites and their geometric relationship to the location determining receiver. For example the DOP may consider the number of satellites that are available (e.g., capable of being received with a reliable signal strength, a signal quality level, a maximum bit or symbol error rate) to a location determining receiver from particular geographic coordinates of the location determining receiver at a given time. In accordance with one embodiment, a low DOP value indicates a higher probability of accuracy. A DOP may comprise any of the following: Position Dilution of Precision, Relative Dilution of Precision, Horizontal Dilution of Precision, Vertical Dilution of Precision, Time Dilution of Precision, and Geometric Dilution of Precision. Position Dilution of Precision refers to a DOP value for the particular three dimensional location or coordinates of the location determining receiver, which is a unit-less figure of merit expressing the relationship between error in the location determining receiver position and error in satellite position. Relative Dilution of Precision provides an indication of the adequacy of observations of a location determining receiver during real-time surveying of measurements. Horizontal Dilution of Precision refers to DOP with respect to latitude and longitude measurements. Vertical dilution of precision refers to DOP with respect to height. Time Dilution of Precision refers to DOP with respect to variations over time.",
        "A user interface 18 may comprise a keyboard, keypad, a display, a pointing device (e.g., mouse, trackball), a magnetic disc drive, a magnetic tape drive, an optical disc, a data port (e.g., parallel, serial or a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port), or another mechanism for inputting or entering input data. A user interface 18 may support the input or entry of data that is used to assess the quality of the reception location data 26, the optical location data 28, and the dead-reckoning location data 30. A user interface 18 may support the entry of true or precision coordinates, location, or bearing of the vehicle from ancillary equipment, such as survey equipment, optical surveying equipment, laser surveying equipment, or otherwise to calibrate, ground-reference or estimate error level (and to facilitate respective quality data estimates) for the output of the location-determining receiver 12, the optical location-determining system 14, and the dead-reckoning system 16.",
        "The data processor 38 may receive or obtain reception location data 26 from the location-determining receiver 12, optical location data 28 from the optical location-determining system 14, and dead-reckoning location data 30 from the dead-reckoning system 16. The reception location data 26 is associated with corresponding reception quality data 32; the optical location data 28 is associated with corresponding optical quality data 34; and the dead-reckoning location data 30 is associated with corresponding dead-reckoning quality data 36. The data processor 38 may be used to implement or control a switching matrix, or a filter such that an output comprises refined location data 40.",
        "In a first example, the data processor 38 selects a preferential one of the reception location data 26, optical location data 28, and dead-reckoning location data 30 for corresponding distinct locations or zones within the work area. For example, the work area may be divided into a first set of zones where reception location data 26 is used to guide the vehicle or plan a path plan for the vehicle; a second set of zones where the optical location data 28 is used to guide the vehicle or plan a path plan for the vehicle; and a third set of zones where the dead-reckoning location data 30 is used to guide the vehicle or plan a path plan for the vehicle. The refined location data 40 may represent selection of the most reliable or accurate data for a corresponding zone when a vehicle is in such a zone.",
        "In a second example, the data processor 38 selects a preferential one of the reception location data 26, optical location data 28, and dead-reckoning location data 30 for corresponding distinct locations or cells within the work area. For example, the work area may be divided into a first set of cells where reception location data 26 is used to guide the vehicle or plan a path plan for the vehicle; a second set of cells where the optical location data 28 is used to guide the vehicle or plan a path plan for the vehicle; and a third set of cells where the dead-reckoning location data 30 is used to guide the vehicle or plan a path plan for the vehicle. The refined location data 40 may represent selection of the most reliable or accurate data for a corresponding zone when a vehicle is in such a zone. The member of the first set of cells may be contiguous or noncontiguous. The member of the second set of cells may be contiguous or noncontiguous. The member of third set of cells may be contiguous or noncontiguous.",
        "In a third example, the data processor 38 may facilitate the application of a first weight to reception location data 26 based on the reception quality data 32 for a particular vehicle location, a second weight to optical location data 28 based on the optical quality data 34 for a particular vehicle location, and a third weight to dead-reckoning location data 30 based on the dead-reckoning quality data 36.

Further, the matrix may comprise a multi-dimensional matrix that varies with time, because the reliability of the reception location data or other location data may vary with time (e.g., as different constellations and numbers of satellites are available at a particular geographic coordinates.)

The cell may be defined by its boundaries or its center point, for example.

For example, the reception quality data may be related to the relative orbital positions or spatial coordinates of the satellites used in the position solution. Further, the greater the number of satellites that can be used in the solution or that are available for reception by the location determining receiver a particular geographic coordinates at a particular time, the more accurate the solution will generally be. A satellite is available for reception if the location determining receiver at particular geographic coordinates at a particular time can receive and decode the satellite's transmission with sufficient reliability, which may depend upon received signal strength, received signal quality, received bit error rate, received symbol error rate, demodulation techniques, decoding techniques for the pseudo-random noise code, or other technical constraints. Obstructions (e.g., stadium walls and protective roofs) may impact the number of satellites used in a solution or the reliability of the one or more received satellite signals. The reception quality data may be expressed as a dilution of precision (DOP), or a subclass or variant thereof. The dilution of precision can be calculated by location within the worksite (e.g., by using satellite position forecasts for the time the stadium will be mowed) or measured empirically with a location-determining receiver 12 (e.g., GPS receiver) that reports DOP recorded at various positions within the work area or site over a period of time.",

        "The method and system of vehicular navigation may be applied to residential, golf course, and other mowers where Global Positioning System (GPS) signals may be blocked or attenuated by trees, buildings, or ground; timber harvesters and forwarders that occasionally or periodically visit clearings (in a forested or wooded area), but otherwise work in areas where GPS signals are blocked by trees or terrain; farm machinery operating a field or farm yard where GPS signals may be blocked by buildings, trees or terrain; and construction and military equipment where GPS signals may be blocked by trees, buildings, or terrain, and many other types of vehicles and equipment.",
        "FIG. 10 is a flow chart of a method for determining a location of a vehicle in accordance with predetermined zones in a work area. The predetermined zones may be established before the vehicle performs a task in the work area or traverses the work area to perform a function. The method of FIG. 10 begins with step S900.",
        "In step S900, a first zone is established in a work area. For example, a user may define a first zone based on a survey or map (e.g., error magnitude contour of FIG. 7) of reception quality data in the work area via user interface 18 and quality estimation module 20. The first zone is where reception location data is applied preferentially or exclusively as refined location data. In the first zone, the reception location data is associated with a corresponding reception quality data that meets or exceeds a certain minimum threshold of reliability within the first zone. Although the optical location data and the odometer location in the first zone may be unreliable or may vary too much to be uniformly reliable over the first zone, in one example the reception location data may still be used for the first zone even where the optical location data, the odometer location data, or both tend to be reliable within material areas of the first zone.",
        "In one embodiment, the first zone may be defined by an outer perimeter, an inner perimeter or both. A series of points (e.g., two or three dimensional coordinates) may be defined on the outer perimeter and the inner perimeter, and stored in a storage device 39 associated with the data processor 38.",
        "In another embodiment, the first zone comprises a series of cells in the work area. It is possible that at least some of the cells of the first zone are noncontinguous. The cells may have a uniform size and shape (e.g., polygonal). Each cell may be associated with its central coordinates, a range of coordinates, or its perimeter coordinates.",
        "In step S902, a second zone is established in a work area. For example, a user may define a second zone based on a survey or map (e.g., error magnitude contour of FIG. 7) of optical quality data in the work area via user interface 18 and quality estimation module 20. The second zone is where optical location data is applied preferentially or exclusively as refined location data. In the second zone, the optical location data is associated with a corresponding optical quality data that meets or exceeds a certain minimum threshold of reliability within the second zone.

        "In step S904, the location-determining receiver 12 determines the reception location data and the optical location-determining receiver 14 determines optical location data to estimate preliminary location data indicating whether the vehicle is located in the first zone or the second zone. It should be noted at this point in time in step S904, the exact position of the vehicle with absolute precision or certainty is not known because there may be error associated with the reception location data and optical location data. The preliminary location data may be derived from the reception location data, the optical location data, or both.",
        "The preliminary location data may be determined in accordance with the following techniques, which may be applied individually or cumulatively. Under a first technique, the preliminary location data comprises the reception location data or the optical location data, if the reception location data and the optical location data are coextensive or spaced apart by a maximum tolerance (e.g., a maximum specified distance).",
        "Under a second technique, the preliminary location data comprises the geometric mean or average of the reception location data and the optical location data, if the reception location data and the optical location data are coextensive or spaced apart by a maximum tolerance. For instance, a line segment interconnects the coordinates of the reception location data and the optical location data, and the geometric mean or average is located on the line segment one-half of the distance between the coordinates or ends of the line segment.",
        "Under a third technique, the preliminary location data comprises the weighted geometric mean or weighted average of the reception location data and the optical location data, if the reception location data and the optical location data are coextensive or spaced apart by a maximum tolerance. For instance, a line segment interconnects the coordinates of the reception location data and the optical location data, and the weighted geometric mean or weighted average is located on the line segment on some distance (which is proportional to the weights assigned to the reception location data and optical location data) between the coordinates or ends of the line segment.",

Under a fifth technique, the preliminary location data comprises the optical location data, if the reception location data is not available or if the reception location data falls below a threshold level of reliability.",
        "In step S906, a data processor 38 or selector selects at least one of the reception location data and the optical location as the refined location data based on whether the preliminary location data falls within the established first zone or the second zone. The selection process of step S906 may determine how to select the refined location data where the estimated preliminary data is inconclusive or suspect in reliability in accordance with various procedures, which may be applied alternately or cumulatively. Under a first procedure, if the estimated preliminary location data is inconclusive with respect to whether the vehicle is located in the first zone, the second zone, the data processor or selector selects the reception location data as the refined location data. Under a second procedure if the estimated preliminary data is inconclusive with respect to whether the vehicle is located in the first zone or second zone and if the reception location data is not available, the data processor or selector selects the optical location data as the refined location data. Under a third procedure, if the estimated preliminary data is inconclusive with respect to whether the vehicle is located in the first zone or the second zone and if the reception location data falls below a threshold reliability level, the data processor 38 or selector selects the optical location data as the refined location data. Under a fourth procedure, if the estimated preliminary data is inconclusive with respect to whether the vehicle is located in the first zone or the second zone, the data processor 38 or selector may select or default to the last selected type of location data for the last verifiable zone in which the vehicle was present, unless more than a maximum threshold time has elapsed.",
        "In considering practical implementation of the method of FIG. 10, the cumulative error of the vehicle relying on any one of the optical location data, the odometer location data, and the reception location data for an excessive time or over an excessive distance without cross-checking against diverse location data may lead to guidance errors or drift. Accordingly, where the method of FIG. 10 is used to execute a path plan, one or more of the following limitations may be placed on over-reliance on any one of the location-determining receiver 12, the optical location-determining system 14, and the dead-reckoning system 16. Under a first illustrative limitation, a path planning module 42 executes or determines a path plan of the vehicle such that the vehicle switches between the first zone and the second zone within a certain maximum time limit. Under a second illustrative limitation, a path planning module 42 executes or determines a path plan of the vehicle such that the vehicle switches between the first zone and the second zone within a certain maximum distance traversed by the vehicle.",
        "The method of FIG. 11 is similar to the method of FIG. 10, except the method of FIG. 11 is expanded to include a third zone and odometer location data. Like reference numbers in FIG. 10 and FIG. 11 indicate like steps or procedures.",
        "After step S900 and step S902, the method continues with step S903. In step S903, a third zone is established in a work area. For example, a user may define a third zone based on a survey or map (e.g., error magnitude contour of FIG. 7) of optical quality data in the work area via user interface 18 and the quality estimation module 20. The third zone is where odometer location data is applied preferentially or exclusively as refined location data.
