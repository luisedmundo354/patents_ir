        "With such projection displays designed to project the viewing pupil having a limited area, it is impossible to view any bright, normal projected image as the viewer's eyes are off that limited pupil area.",
        "However, as long as one of both eyes of the viewer stays in the viewing pupil area especially in the horizontal direction, it is not necessarily easy for the viewer to take notice of another eye being off the limited pupil area.",

        "Preferably in this case, misalignment warning projectors are located adjacent to both left and right sides of at least one of said projection optical systems.",
        "There could also be provided a 3D projection display comprising a left display device for displaying a left parallactic image and a right display device for displaying a right parallactic image as well as a left projection optical system and a right projection optical system, wherein two misalignment warning projectors are located adjacent to both left and right sides of a set of said left and right projection optical systems.",

        "Still other objects and advantages of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part be apparent from the specification.",
        "The invention accordingly comprises the features of construction, combinations of elements, and arrangement of parts which will be exemplified in the construction hereinafter set forth, and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the claims.",

        "FIGS. 4(a) and 4(b) are illustrative in schematic of a transmission type 3D projection display and a reflection type 3D projection display, respectively.",
        "FIGS. 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c) are illustrative of the principles of how an exit pupil image (viewing image) is magnified in the 3D projection displays of FIGS. 4(a) and 4(b).",
        "The projection display of the invention is now explained with reference to its preferred embodiments.",
        "FIG. 4 is generally illustrative in construction of one embodiment of the invention, specifically a 3D projection display 10 wherein two left and right 2D parallactic images appearing on two 2D display devices 11L, 11R are simultaneously projected onto a display panel 15 for 3D representation. Here FIG. 4(a) is illustrative in schematic of the construction of a transmission type projection display, and FIG. 4(b) is illustrative in schematic of the construction of a reflection type projection display. In FIG. 4(b), for convenience, only the right-eye arrangement is shown; the left-eye arrangement is not shown.",
        "The 3D projection displays 10 shown in FIGS. 4(a) and 4(b) are each made up of display devices 11L, 11R, projection optical systems 12L, 12R, an image-formation optical system 13, and a diffuser plate 14 that is in contact with, or slightly spaced away from, the viewing side of the image-formation optical system 13. The image-formation optical system 13 and the diffuser plate 14 form together the display panel 15.",
        "The left and right projection optical systems 12L and 12R are operable to project parallactic images appearing on the left and right display devices 11L and 11R onto the viewing side. Both the optical systems are located such that the parallactic images are projected onto the same display plane of the display panel 15, while the image-formation optical system 13 is located near that same display plane. In this arrangement, the exit pupils 16L and 16R of the projection optical systems 12L and 12R are projected onto the viewing side. As the viewer has left and right eyes EL and ER in alignment with the positions of the projected exit pupil images, it permits the viewer to view the images appearing on the display devices 11L and 11R. The diffuser plate 14 acts to magnify the viewing pupils, and the image-formation optical system 13 and the diffuser plate 14 are located on the display plane position.",
        "At the display plane position, the images projected through the projection optical systems 12L and 12R and displayed on the display devices 11L and 11R are formed. For the image-formation optical system 13 located on that image-formation position, a Fresnel lens (convex lens) is used in the case of the transmission type 3D projection display (FIG. 4(a)), and a Fresnel mirror (concave mirror) in the case of the reflection type 3D projection display (FIG. 4(b)). The diffuser plate 14, for instance, may be a diffuser plate comprising a transparent substrate roughened on its surface to impart directivity thereto, a directional HOE scatter film, or a directional diffusing plane formed on the entrance surface of the Fresnel mirror or the exit surface of the Fresnel lens.",
        "The Fresnel mirror, and the Fresnel lens is adapted to form the images of two exit pupils 16L and 16R on the viewing side. Each Fresnel plane is located at (or near) the display plane position, so that the projected image can be viewed with high resolution yet with no quality deterioration. The Fresnel mirror, and the Fresnel lens is located in a flat sheet form unlike a concave mirror.",
        "FIG. 5(a) is illustrative of the principles of how exit pupil images (viewing pupils) 21L and 21R are magnified in the 3D projection display 10 that is of the transmission type.",
        "A diffuser plate 14 is located together with an image-formation optical system 13 at or near a planar form of display surface position of a display panel 15. In FIG. 5(a), the image-formation optical system 13 acts to form the images of exit pupils 16L and 16R of left and right projection optical systems 12L and 12R at given positions on the viewing side with the diameter, \u03a60, of the exit pupils 16L and 16R changed to a magnitude of \u03a60\u2032. At the ext pupil image position, the eyeballs EL and ER of the viewer are located. Here, the diffuser plate 14 is designed to make use of its diffusion action to magnify the images of the exit pupils 16L and 16R (the images of the exit pupils 16L and 16R of the left and right projection optical systems 12L and 12R)\u2014which should be formed with the magnitude of \u03a60\u2032\u2014 to viewing pupils 21L and 21R having a magnitude of \u03a61\u2032. It is noted that the left and right viewing pupils 21L and 21R magnified through the diffuser plate 14 are determined in terms of position and diameter in such a way as not to overlap each other. The diffuser plate 14 has only one diffusion action in the case of the transmission type 3D projection display because light transmits only once through the diffuser plate 14 located at the display plane position, and double diffusion actions in the case of the reflection type 3D projection display (not shown in FIG. 5), because light transmits twice through a diffusing optical system located at the display plane position.",
        "FIGS. 5(b) and 5(c) are illustrative of brightness distributions in left and right viewing pupils 21L and 21R. An in-pupil distribution is of two types, i.e., a uniform type as depicted in FIG. 5(b) and a type approximate to Gaussian distribution as depicted in FIG. 5(c). In any event, light intensity at a site where the left and right pupils overlap each other should be small enough to substantially eliminate any overlap. It is thus possible to present images at left and right projectors 20L and 20R to the left and right pupils EL and ER of the viewer in a mutually independent state, making 3D viewing possible without recourse to spectacles.",
        "FIG. 1 is illustrative in construction of one embodiment of such a 3D projection display wherein a misalignment warning is indicated on the outside of viewing pupils 21L and 21R according to the invention. This 3D projection display is designed in the form of a transmission type 3D projection display as in FIG. 4(a). In this transmission type 3D projection display, how left and right projectors 20L, 20R and a display panel 15 are constructed, and what relations they are located in is the same as in FIG. 4(a), and in the left and right projectors 20L and 20R, the associated left and right projection optical systems 12L and 12R are adapted to project parallactic images appearing on the associated display devices 11L and 11R onto the same display plane of the display panel 15, as shown in FIG. 4(a). An image-formation optical system 13 in the display panel 15 is adapted to project the exit pupils 16L and 16R of the projection optical systems 12L and 12R on the viewing side. A diffuser plate 14 in the display panel 15 is adapted to magnify the pupil images of the exit pupils 16L and 16R to viewing pupils 21L and 21R. As the viewer has the pupils EL and ER of the left and right eyes positioned in the magnified and projected viewing pupils 21L and 21R, the viewer can obtain a 3D viewing of images appearing on the display devices 11L and 11R. According to the invention, a separate projector 30L is located on the outside of the left projector 20L (the side that faces away from the right projector 20R), and a separate projector 30R is located on the outside of the right projector 20R (the side that faces away from the left projector 20L). The left- and right-outer projectors 30L and 30R have the same construction, and each one comprises projection optical systems 31L and 31R having exit pupils 33L and 33R, respectively, and display portions 32L and 32R. The display portions 32L and 32R, when having no self-emitter, may have an illumination system (not shown).",
        "The left- and right-outer projectors 30L and 30R are located such that the exit pupils 33L and 33R thereof are magnified and projected by way of the actions of an image-formation optical system 13 and a diffuser plate 14 that form together the display panel 15 to form warning pupils 41L and 41R that are adjacent to, or overlap slightly with, the outside of the viewing pupils 21L and 21R. Projection optical systems 31L and 31R in the left- and right-outer projectors 30L and 30R are adapted to project images of markings, characters or colors displayed on the associated display portions 32L and 32R onto the same display plane of the display panel 15 for the parallactic images. The markings, characters or colors displayed on the display portions 32L and 32R will be explained later.",
        "Such being the arrangement, as long as the pupils EL and ER of both eyes of the viewer are positioned within the left and right viewing pupils 21L and 21R, the viewer can view normal left and right parallactic images for normal 3D viewing.",
        "Consider now that the head of the viewer moves in an arrow A direction and the right-eye ER is on the verge of coming off the right viewing pupil 21R. Then, the pupil of the right-eye ER receives a part of light coming from a right warning pupil 41R adjacent thereto, so that the viewer can see the markings, characters or colors displayed on the display portion 32R in the right-outer projector 30R. Here, if on the display portion 32R there is indicated a word of warning such as \u201cMove over to the right\u201d, an arrow pattern with projected images turning right on the display panel 15 or a simple across-the-plane red color, then the viewer can see such a word, arrow pattern or red color through the right eye EL. As a result, the viewer can take notice of the head being too close to the right in the arrow A direction to allow it to go back to the normal position.",
        "Conversely, consider that the head of the viewer moves in an arrow B direction and the left-eye EL is on the verge of coming off the left viewing pupil 21L. Then, the pupil of the left-eye EL receives a part of light coming from a left warning pupil 41L adjacent thereto, so that the viewer can see the markings, characters or colors displayed on the display portion 32L in the left-outer projector 30L. Here, if on the display portion 32L there is indicated a word of warning such as \u201cMove over to the right\u201d, an arrow pattern with projected images turning left on the display panel 15 or a simple across-the-plane blue color, then the viewer can see such a word, arrow pattern or blue color through the left-eye EL. As a result, the viewer can take notice of the head being too close to the left in the arrow B direction to allow it to go back to the normal position.",
        "While a set of the projectors 30L and 30R for warning that the eyes of the viewer are off the normal position is located on the outside of the displaying projectors 20L and 20R in the above embodiment, it is understood that another set of similar projectors could be located in the vertical direction to warn that both eyes are off the normal position not only in the left-and-right direction but also in the vertical direction.",
        "While the above embodiment has been explained with reference to the application of the warning projectors 30L and 30R to the transmission type 3D projection display, it is understood that they could also be applied to the reflection type projection display.",
        "Further, warning projectors similar to the projectors 30L and 30R could be applied to a 2D projection display including only one displaying projector with only one viewing pupil being formed. That is, they could be located on the left and right sides, and optionally on the upper and lower sides, of the displaying projector to warn that the eyes of the viewer are off the normal positions.",
        "Referring then to FIG. 2, there is shown one construction of another embodiment of the projection display according to the invention. Specifically, misalignment warning projectors are located on the outside of viewing pupils 211 and 212 in a projection display that enables a plurality of viewers to view separate projected images. That projection display for presenting separate projected images to a plurality of viewers is analogous to the 3D projection display of FIG. 1. That is, the constructions of a plurality of separate projectors 121 and 122 and display panel 15 and how they are located are pretty much the same as in FIG. 4(a). As shown in FIG. 2, projection optical systems 121 and 122 in a plurality (two in FIG. 2) of separate projectors 201 and 202 are adapted to project separate 2D images appearing on the associated display devices 111 and 112 onto the same display plane of the display panel 15. An image-formation optical system 13 in the display panel 15 projects the exit pupils 161 and 162 of the projection optical systems 121 and 122 onto the viewer side, and a diffuser plate 14 in the display panel 15 magnifies the pupil images of the exit pupils 161 and 162 to viewing pupils 211 and 212. As separate viewers M1 and M2 have the pupils of both eyes positioned within the respective magnified and projected viewing pupils 221 and 222, they can separately view mutually different images appearing on the display devices 111 and 112.",
        "Then, a projector 30R similar to the warning projector 30R of FIG. 1 is located on the outside of one projector 201 (the side that faces away from another projector 202), and an exit pupil 33R of a projection optical system 31R thereof is magnified and projected under the actions of the image-formation optical system 13 and diffuser plate 14 in the display panel 15 into a warning pupil 41R that is adjacent to, or overlaps slightly with, the outside of the viewing pupil 21, for the one projector 201. Likewise, a projector 30L similar to the warning projector 30L of FIG. 1 is located on the outside of another projector 202 (the side that faces away from the one projector 201), and an exit pupil 33L of a projection optical system 31L thereof is magnified and projected under the actions of the image-formation optical system 13 and diffuser plate 14 in the display panel 15 into a warning pupil 41L that is adjacent to, or overlaps slightly with, the outside of the viewing pupil 212 for the another projector 202.",
        "In this embodiment, yet another projector 30C is also located between both projectors 201 and 202, and an exit pupil 33C of a projection optical system 31C thereof is magnified and projected under the actions of the image-formation optical system 13 and diffuser plate 14 in the display panel 15 into a warning pupil 41C that is interposed between the viewing pupils 211 and 212 for both projectors 201 and 202 and is adjacent to, or overlaps slightly with, them.",
        "As is the case with the embodiment of FIG. 1, markings, characters or colors similar to those mentioned above are indicated on display portions 32L, 32C and 32R of the warning projectors 30L, 30C and 30R, so that, as long as the eyes of the viewers M1 and M2 are positioned within the associated viewing pupils 211 and 212, they can obtain a normal 3D viewing of the normal left and right parallactic images. However, as the eyes are on the verge of being off the viewing pupils 211 and 212 in any of the left and right directions, the eye of any of the viewers M1 and M2 receives a part of light coming from any one of the warning pupils 41L, 41C and 41R adjacent thereto, so that they can see the markings, characters or colors indicated on the display portions 32L, 32C and 32R of the associated projectors 30L, 30C and 30R. Consequently, each of the viewers M1 and M2 can take notice of the head being off the viewing position to allow it to go back to the normal position.",
        "FIG. 3 is illustrative in schematic of the inventive projection display as applied to a display device in a surgical stereomicroscope. Operation or the like is performed while an affected site O is viewed under a surgical stereomicroscope 50. A reflection type 3D projection display 10\u2032 according to the invention is affixed to the surgical stereomicroscope 50, and the principles of 3D representations by the reflection type 3D projection display are the same as in FIG. 4(b). As in FIG. 1, warning projectors 30L and 30R are located on both sides of a set of left and right projectors 20L and 20R in the reflection type projection display 10\u2032, so that a viewer M can take notice of being off a 3D viewing position to go back to the normal viewing position for ensuring a proper 3D viewing of the affected site O.",
        "While the inventive projection display has been explained with reference to some preferred embodiments, it is understood that the invention is by no means limited thereto, and many modifications may be possible."
