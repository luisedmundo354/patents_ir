        "The present invention generally relates to a means and method of maintaining a constant temperature in the magnetic assembly of a magnetic resonance device.",
        "A magnetic resonance imaging device produces a measurement of a sample which is based upon its molecular structure. The sample is subjected to a polarizing magnetic field which has the effect of aligning the spins of all the atomic nuclei of the sample. Radio waves at a frequency close to the Lamor frequency of the nuclei are then used to excite the nuclei such that their magnetic alignment is reversed. Once the excitation is removed the nuclei return to their original state by emitting characteristic radio signals. It is these radio signals that can be used to image the sample.",
        "The exact Lamor frequency is dependent upon the precise magnetic field. By creating a magnetic field gradient within the sample cavity the source of these signals can be located such that an overall image of the sample can be constructed.",
        "The efficiency of this process depends upon the consistency of the magnetic field strength within the sample cavity. This field is typically controlled to within 5 parts per million. The extent of the uniformity of the magnetic field determines the accuracy with which the Lamor frequency can be measured. This allows for the resolution of smaller chemical shifts.",
        "The magnetic field is dependent to a large extent upon the ferromagnetic properties of the materials making up its magnetic assembly. These ferromagnetic characteristics are often temperature dependent and so it is important to maintain the magnetic assembly at a constant temperature. This can be particularly problematic where the temperature of the sample being imaged is itself fluctuating. In such a scenario it is necessary to introduce a means of insulating the magnetic assembly from the magnetic assembly.",
        "Passive insulation is insufficient to stabilize a sensitive permanent-magnet magnetic resonance system. This is due to the nature of permanent magnet material that has a sensitive temperature coefficient that causes the magnetic field of the system to fluctuate beyond an acceptable range.

        "The following example will clarify the concept. Heater 25 heats the shielding fluid, to a predetermined temperature as it enters the magnet. That temperature should be a couple degrees above the maximum temperature allowed for the sample that flows through the NMR probe (referred to as the \u201ctested material\u201d). As the tested material flows through the NMR probe, it releases energy via conductivity or reflection and causes the shielding fluid to rise in temperature, but because the shielding fluid is flowing, the layers of the liquid close to the tested material carries this energy out of the magnet cavity and into the heat exchanger where the temperature of the shielding fluid is reduced below the temperature of the tested material. As the flow of the shielding fluid continues in the loop, it goes again through the heater to bring the temperature back to the predetermined temperature in order to assure that the temperature of the layer that comes in contact with the magnet or the insulating layer will be at a constant temperature. The balance between the heat capacity of the shielding material, the energy emitted from the tested material and the flow rate of the shielding fluid will ensure a permanent temperature at the layer of the shielding fluid that has contact with the magnet and keeps the temperature equilibrium in the long run within a predetermined range of temperature fluctuation of the tested material, as long as the tested material does not exceed a certain temperature and as long as the time constant of the heat transfer of the shielding liquid is not interrupted, meaning the flow rate doesn't change.",

Elements 6 and 7 can be controlled in real-time, based on the actual performance and control of the closed loop required for a particular tested material.

Heat flows from the sample to the shielding fluid as indicated by the arrow, B, the rate of this heat flow depends upon the difference between TS and the temperature of the internal surface of the envelope, TB. The temperature of the outer surface of the envelope, TA depends upon a number of factors including the internal surface temperature TB, the heat capacity of the shielding fluid, the thickness of the envelope, and the flow rate of the shielding fluid, indicated by the arrow F.",
        "In example II, the temperature of the sample has increased i.e. T'S>TS. T'B may now increase as the rate of heat flow into the shielding fluid, B\u2032 is now greater than B. It is possible to reduce heat flow from the shielding fluid to the magnetic assembly by increasing the flow rate, F\u2032. In this way the temperature of the magnetic assembly is maintained."
