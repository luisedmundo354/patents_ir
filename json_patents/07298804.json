    "abstract": "A receiver for receiving complex symbols in a radio communication system, in which a symbol arranger collects signals from at least three transmitter antennas through at least one receiver antenna over four time intervals; a channel estimator estimates at least three channel gains from the three transmitter antennas to the receiver antenna; first and second decoders each compute metrics for all possible pairs of symbols using the received signals and channel gains, and detect two symbols having a minimum metric; And a P/S (Parallel to Serial) converter arranges the detected symbols in the right order. Each decoder linearly operates the received signals and channel gains, pre-detects two symbols using threshold detection, and outputs the pre-detected symbols as final symbols if the product of the product of the pre-detected symbols and a constant determined by the channel gains is a minimum.",

        "An effective technique of relieving multi-path fading in a radio communication system is time and frequency diversity. Vahid Tarokh et al. has proposed a space-time block code. Space-time block codes are a well-known antenna diversity scheme disclosed in \u201cSpace Time Block Coding from Orthogonal Design\u201d, IEEE Trans. On Info., Theory, Vol. 45, pp. 1456-1467, July 1999. Tarokh's space-time block code is an extension of transmitter antenna diversity as introduced by S. M. Alamouti, which allows use of two or more antennas. Tarokh's space-time block code is disclosed in \u201cSpace Time Block Coding from Orthogonal Design\u201d, IEEE Trans. On Info., Theory, Vol. 45, pp. 1456-1467, July 1999, and Alamouti's space-time block code is found in \u201cA Simple Transmitter Diversity Scheme for Wireless Communications\u201d, IEEE Journal on Selected Area in Communications, Vol. 16, pp. 1451-1458, October 1998.",
        "FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a conventional transmitter using a space-time block code as proposed by Tarokh. Referring to FIG. 1, the transmitter includes a serial-to-parallel (S/P) converter 110 and an encoder 120. It is assumed here that the transmitter uses three transmitter antennas 130, 132 and 134.",
        "In operation, the S/P converter 110 provides the four symbols in each block to the encoder 120.

        "More specifically, the first three symbols s1, s2, s3 are provided to the three antennas 130, 132 and 134, respectively for a first time interval. In the same manner, the last three symbols s4*, s3*, s2* are provided to the antennas 130, 132 and 134, respectively for the last time interval.

        "In operation, the channel estimator 150 estimates channel coefficients representing channel gains from the transmitter antennas to the receiver antennas. The multi-channel symbol arranger 160 collects symbols from the receiver antennas 140 to 142. The detector 170 then obtains hypotheses by multiplying the received symbols by the channel coefficients, calculates a decision statistic for all possible symbols using the hypotheses, and detects transmission symbols by threshold detection.",
        "Alamouti's space-time coding achieves a maximum diversity order, that is, a diversity order identical to the number of transmitter antennas without data rate loss despite transmission of complex symbols through two transmitter antennas. This is expanded by Tarokh's space-time coding implemented in the transmitter and receiver illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2. According to this scheme, a maximum diversity order is achieved using space-time block codes in the form of a matrix having orthogonal rows. The transmission of four complex symbols for eight time intervals, however, leads to decreasing the data rate by half. Since eight time intervals are taken to transmit one whole block (i.e. four symbols), reception performance is degraded due to the change of channel environment for the block in the case of fast fading.",
        "As described above, when transmitting complex symbols through three or more antennas using conventional space-time block coding, 2N time intervals are required to transmit N symbols, resulting in a data rate loss. Therefore, transmission latency is lengthened and data rate is lowered.",
        "It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a receiving apparatus for achieving a maximum diversity order and a maximum data rate without a data rate loss in a mobile communication system using at least three transmitter antennas.",
        "It is another object of the present invention to provide a receiving apparatus for increasing symbol processing speed by reducing reception complexity in a mobile communication system using at least three transmitter antennas.",
        "The above objects are achieved by a receiver for receiving complex symbols in a radio communication system. In the receiver, at least one receiver antenna receives signals from at least three transmitter antennas and a symbol arranger collects the signals from the receiver antenna for four time intervals. A channel estimator estimates at least three channel gains from the at least three transmitter antennas to the at least one receiver antenna. The first and second decoders compute metrics for all possible pairs of symbols using the received signals and the channel gains, and each detects a pair of symbols giving a minimum metric. A parallel-to-serial converter arranges the four symbols detected by the first and second decoders in the right order. According to the present invention, the first and second decoders linearly operate the received signals with the channel gains, pre-detects two symbols using threshold detection, and output the pre-detected two symbols as final symbols if the product of the product of the pre-detected symbols and a constant determined by the channel gains is a minimum.",

The diversity order is maintained at a maximum value, i.e. 3, irrespective of whether the two symbols are phase-rotated by different values or the same value. In the same manner, final coding matrices can be achieved by rotating the phases of two symbols determining different metrics in coding matrices (8) by a predetermined value.",
        "An exemplary transmitter using the above-described coding matrices is illustrated in FIG. 3.",
        "FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a transmitter using space-time block coding to which the present invention is applied. As illustrated, the transmitter is comprised of an S/P converter 210, phase rotators 220 and 222, an encoder 230, and three transmitter antennas 240, 242 and 244.",
        "Referring to FIG. 3, the S/P converter 210 provides the four symbols in each block to the encoder 230. Here, two selected symbols s1 and s4 are phase-rotated by the predetermined values \u03b81 and \u03b84, respectively, in the phase rotators 220 a/nd 222. Choice of the two symbols is made in the manner that they are related to various metrics in a receiver. This choice is disclosed in a Korean Patent Application No. P20030001454 by the same inventors, this application is incorporated herein by reference. The encoder 230 produces four symbol sets, each including three symbols, from the block of symbols containing the two phase-rotated symbols, and feeds them to the three transmitter antennas 240, 242 and 244 over four time intervals.",
        "To achieve a maximum diversity order, the encoder 230 builds the symbol sets so that the four complex symbols are transmitted once from each antenna and once for each time interval. Also, the encoder 230 derives the negatives and conjugates of the input symbols for the symbol sets, in order to construct orthogonality of symbol sequences for the transmitter antennas. The reason for rotating the phases of the selected two input symbols is to achieve the maximum diversity order even in the case where the input symbols are complex.",
        "If the four symbol sets to be transmitted through the three antennas are represented as a 4\u00d73 matrix, symbols in an mth column are sequentially provided to an mth antenna. In other words, symbols in an nth row are provided simultaneously to the three antennas, for transmission in an nth time interval.",
        "For example, if s1 and s4 among s1, s2, s3, s4 are phase-rotated by \u03b81 and \u03b84, respectively, the outputs of the encoder 230 can be expressed as a 4\u00d73 coding matrix such as matrix (11). If coding matrix (11) is used, the three symbols ej\u03981s1, s2, and ej\u03984s4 in the first row are fed to the three antennas 240, 242 and 244 for the first time interval, and the three symbols s3, ej\u03984s4, and s2 in the fourth row are fed to the three antennas 240, 242 and 244 for the fourth time interval.",

A symbol arranger 330 collects signals r1, r2, r3 r4 received at the receiver antennas 310 to 315.",
        "If a single receiver antenna is used, the symbol arranger 330 builds one block from the four received signals r1, r2, r3 r4. If two or more receiver antennas are used, the symbol arranger 330 builds a block in the form of a matrix from the received signals. In the matrix, the columns correspond to the receiver antennas and the rows correspond to time intervals. While a plurality of received antennas 310 to 315 is shown, the operation of the receiver will be described below in the context of a single receiver antenna for notational simplicity.",
        "To recover the four symbols s1, s2, s3, s4 transmitted from the transmitter, the first decoder 340 detects s1 and s3 using the channel gains and the received signals, and the second decoder 345 detects s2 and s4 in the same manner. Thus, the four symbols are simultaneously detected in the decoders 340 and 345. To distinguish the detected symbols from the original symbols, the former is represented as s\u2032.",
        "In the case of coding matrix (11), a symbol generator 350 of the first decoder 340 generates all available sub-combinations of s1 and s3, and a phase rotator 352 phase-rotates s1 by the value \u03b81 used in the transmitter and thus outputs ej\u03981s1.",
        "A metric calculator 370 computes metrics for all available symbol sub-combinations, each containing one phase-rotated symbol, using formula (9) on the channel gains h1, h2, h3 and the received signals r1, r2, r3 r4. A minimum metric detector 380 then detects symbols s1\u2032 and s3\u2032 that give a minimum metric.",
        "The second decoder 345 operates in the same manner on s2 and s4. After the first decoder 340 detects s1\u2032 and s3\u2032 and the second decoder 345 detects s2\u2032 and s4\u2032, a parallel-to-serial (P/S) converter 390 arranges the detected symbols in the right order and outputs a symbol set, s1\u2032, s2\u2032, s3\u2032, s4\u2032.",
        "When the thus-constituted receiver illustrated in FIG. 4 uses a QPSK signal constellation, 16 sub-combinations of s1 and s3 and 16 sub-combinations of s2 and s4 are available. To detect desired symbols, the metric calculators 370 and 375 must compute formulas (9) and (10), each 32 times. Computation of one metric takes one complex multiplication (equivalent to four real number multiplications), one real number multiplication, four additions (subtractions), two norm operations (equivalent to two real number multiplications), and one comparison. In other words, it requires a total of seven real number multiplications and four additions. Thus, it can be said that decoding one block (two symbol sub-combinations) with respect to 32 sub-combinations requires a total of 224 real number multiplications, 128 additions, and 32 comparisons.",
        "Repetition of this volume of computation each time four symbols are received imposes a great constraint on high-speed data service. In the present invention, therefore, the computation requirement for the receiver with respect to three transmitter antennas is reduced to thereby allow the receiver to receive symbol data at a high rate.",
        "As described before, the receiver communicating with the three transmitter antennas detects four symbols that minimize formulas (9) and (10). Because C1 and C2 are zero, formulas (9) and (10) can be expressed as formulas (12) and (13), respectively:\n\n|R1\u2212x1|2+|R3\u2212x3|2+2(C3)Re{x1*x3}\u2003\u2003(12)\n\nand\n\n|R2\u2212x1|2+|R4\u2212x4|2+2(C4)Re{x2*x4}\u2003\u2003(13)\n\nwhere x1, x2, x3, x4 are four symbols containing two phase-rotated symbols. That is, x1=ej\u03981s1, x2=s2, x3=s3, x4=ej\u03984s4.",
        "A receiver based on the above principle according to another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 6. The receiver also includes two independent ML decoders 440 and 445.",
        "Referring to FIG. 6, a channel estimator 420 estimates channel coefficients, namely, channel gains h1, h2, h3 from the three transmitter antennas 240, 242 and 244 to receiver antennas 410 to 415. A symbol arranger 430 collects signals r1, r2, r3, r4 received at the receiver antennas 310 to 315 over four time intervals.",
        "If a single receiver antenna is used, the symbol arranger 430 collects the received signals r1, r2, r3 r4 through the single antenna because the transmitter transmits one block of symbols for four time intervals. If two or more receiver antennas are used, the symbol arranger 330 builds a block in the form of a matrix from the received signals. In the matrix, the columns correspond to the receiver antennas and the rows correspond to the time intervals. While a plurality of received antennas 410 to 415 is shown, the operation of the receiver will be described below in the context of a single receiver antenna for notational simplicity.",
        "To recover the four symbols s1, s2, s3, s4 transmitted from the transmitter, the first decoder 440 detects s1 and s3 using the channel gains and the received signals, and the second decoder 445 detects s2 and s4 in the same manner.

        "In the case of coding matrix (11), a symbol generator 450 of the first decoder 440 generates all available sub-combinations of s1 and s3, and a phase rotator 452 phase-rotates s1 by the value \u03b81 used in the transmitter and thus outputs ej\u03b81s1. ej\u03b81s1 and s3 are referred to as a symbol sub-set. All available symbol sub-sets generated from the symbol generator 450 and the phase rotator 452 are fed to both a threshold detector 460 and a metric calculator 470 at the same time.",
        "The threshold detector 460 pre-detects symbols s1\u2032 and s3\u2032 that best approximate thresholds R1 and R3 using the channel gains h1, h2, h3 and the received signals r1, r2, r3, r4. A decider 462 computes (C3)Re{e\u2212j\u03b81s1*s3} using C3 calculated according to the channel gains and the pre-detected s1\u2032 and s3\u2032. If the computed value is a minimum, the decider 462 outputs the pre-detected s1\u2032 and s3\u2032. At this time, the metric calculator 470 and a minimum metric detector 480 are deactivated.",
        "If 45\u00b0-phase rotation is allowed for the QPSK signal constellation, the decider 462 can determine whether (C3)Re{e\u2212j\u03b81s1*s3} is a minimum by simply checking its sign. If it is negative-signed, the decider 462 outputs the pre-detected symbols as final symbols, and the metric calculator 470 and the minimum metric detector 480 are deactivated.",
        "FIG. 5 illustrates symbols needed to compute formula (12) in a QPSK signal constellation. As illustrated, the last term (C3)Re{e\u2212j\u03b81s1*s3} in formula (12) is +C3 or \u2212C3. If the term is negative-signed, detection of s1 and s3 that minimize formula (12) is equivalent to detection of s1 that minimizes the first term |R1\u2212ej\u03b81s1|2 of formula (12) and s3 that minimizes the second term |R3\u2212s3|2 of formula 12. The same thing occurs with respect to formula (13) and s2 and s4. The minimizations of |R1\u2212ej\u03b81s1|2 and |R3\u2212s3|2 are equivalent to determinations of s1 and s3 that best approximate the thresholds R1 and R3, that is, threshold detection.",
        "If the value computed by the decider is not a minimum, the metric calculator 470 computes metrics for all available symbol sub-sets using formula (12) on R1, R3, and C3 which are obtained using the channel gains and the received signals. The metric calculator 470 may compute R1, R3, and C3 directly, or receive them from the threshold detector 460. In the latter case, the decider 462 feeds R1, R3, and C3 to the metric calculator 479 for symbol detection if the computed value is not a minimum. The minimum metric detector 480 then detects s1\u2032 and s3\u2032 that give the minimum metric.",
        "The second decoder 445 operates in the same manner. After the first decoder 440 detects s1\u2032 and s3\u2032 and the second decoder 445 detects s2\u2032 and s4\u2032, a P/S converter 490 arranges the detected symbols in the right order and outputs a symbol set s1\u2032, s2\u2032, s3\u2032, s4\u2032.",
        "In the receiver illustrated in FIG. 6, one decoder carries out one complex multiplication (equivalent to four real number multiplications), one real number multiplication, and three minimum value decisions. Because the minimum value computation is a comparison with a pre-stored minimum value, five real number multiplications and three comparisons are eventually required. The probability of the sign being negative is \u00bd for QPSK. Hence, 122 real number multiplications, 64 real number additions, and 22 comparisons on the average are required for every pair of symbols. It is apparent from Table 1 that the receiver illustrated in FIG. 6 requires half the computational complexity of the receiver illustrated in FIG. 4.",

        "The threshold detector 460 pre-detects symbols that approximate R1 and R3 and the threshold detector 465 pre-detects symbols that approximate R2 and R4.

If they are minima, the deciders 462 and 467 output the pre-detected symbols as final symbols. The metric calculators 370 and 375 detect symbols that minimize formulas (15) and (16) only when |R13\u2212x1*x3|2\u2212|x1|2|x3|2 and |R24\u2212x2*x4|2\u2212|x2|2|x4|2 are not minima.",
        "As described above, the present invention achieves a maximum diversity order without data rate loss even when complex symbols are transmitted. It also minimizes transmission latency. The resulting robustness against fast fading and simplified decoding design reduce production cost and contribute to system miniaturization.",
