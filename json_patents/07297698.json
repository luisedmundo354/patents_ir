        "Androgen which is one kind of steroid hormones is secreted from the testis and adrenal cortex and causes an androgenic hormone action. Androgen is taken in a target cell to act on an androgen receptor and the receptor combined with androgen forms a dimer. Then, the dimer binds to an androgen-response-element on a DNA to accelerate synthesis of an m-RNA and to induce proteins which direct androgenic actions, whereby various actions are expressed in vivo (Prostate Suppl., 6, 1996, 45-51, Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism, 1998 9(8), 317-324).",
        "Diseases in which androgen acts as an aggravating factor include prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, virilism, hirsutism, baldness, acne, seborrhea, and the like. Therefore, antiandrogenic agents have been employed for treating these diseases which may be attributed to androgen.",
        "Antiandrogenic agents, which have substrate resembling steroidal structure or non-steroidal structure are currently used in the clinical field. Though chlormadinone acetate and the like are known as the steroidal antiandrogen, it is known that, since separation of actions of these compounds from other steroids having similar structures is not sufficient, they cause changes in the blood hormone level and induces serious side effects such as reduction of libido and the like (Jpn. J. Clin. Oncol., 1993, 23(3), 178-185).",
        "On the other hand, as the compounds each having a non-steroidal structure, acylanilide derivatives such as flutamide (Patent Document 1) and bicalutamide (Patent Literarues 2 and 3) are known but these compounds are not sufficient in antiandrogenic action. Therefore, in the treatment of prostate cancer, combination therapy with an LH-RH agonist is generally adopted (Non-Patent Document 1).",
        "The compounds of the present invention are compounds which fall within the range of the following general formula defined in claims of Patent Document 4:",
        "for the symbols in the formula, refer to Patent Document 4, and have the same pharmacological action but the compounds in present invention are not disclosed or suggested as specific examples in the above Document. The compounds having the most strong activity described in the above Document have problems of agonistic action, body weight loss, and the like other than the main effect. Also, the compound in the above Document having no these side effects and having a strong activity exhibits a low oral activity. Thus, it has been desired to develop a pharmaceutical agent which further improves these points.\n\n    [Patent Document 1]",

At this time, it is possible to synthesize an optically active (II) by using an optically active (VI). As the optically active (VI), the derivative where P is allyl, benzyl, or tert-butoxycarbonyl is known. Moreover, when (VI) is a racemic one or 2,5-trans-dimethylpiperazine, it is possible to obtain an optically active (II) by conducting the condensation reaction under an optically active environment. Alternatively, an optically active (II) can be obtained by optical resolution of the resulting racemic one. As a method for such optical resolution, it is possible to employ known optically active columns such as optical resolution columns CHIRALCEL OH-H and CHIIRALPAK AD-H manufactured by Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd. Moreover, optical resolution using an optically active acid is also possible and, as optically active carboxylic acids to be used at this time, use can be made of organic acids such as tartaric acid, di-p-toluoyltartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, camphorsulfonic acid, and mandelic acid. Methods for such optical resolution are described in \u201cYuki Gosei Handbook (Handbook for Organic Synthesis)\u201d edited by Society of Synthetic Organic Chemistry, Japan, Maruzen, Tokyo, 1990, P760 and the like.

At the conversion of the carboxylic acid (VII) into the isocyanate (IX), it is advantageous to use a method of converting the carboxylic acid into a reactive derivative such as an acid chloride, a mixed acid anhydride, or an active-ester and then reacting it with sodium azide to obtain an acid azide (VIII), followed by heating or irradiation with a light, addition of an activating agent such as a Lewis acid, or the like. As conditions for activating such carboxylic acid, the method for activating the carbamic acid described in the first production method is applicable. Moreover, when DPPA or the like is used, it is easy to convert the carboxylic acid into the acid azide and, in some cases, it is possible to convert it into the isocyanate directly. On the other hand, it is possible to react a corresponding amine derivative (X) with phosgene or a phosgene equivalent to form the isocyanate. As such a phosgene equivalent, there may be mentioned phosgene dimer, triphosgene, CDI, chloro phenyl carbonate, DSC, a combination of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate and DMAP, or the like.

        "A solution in which the cytoplasmic fraction obtained in (1) was adjusted to 2 mg/ml in terms of a protein concentration was used as a rat androgen receptor solution. To 400 \u03bcl of the androgen receptor solution were added 3H-mibolerone, triamcinolone acetate, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) so as to be final concentrations of 1M, 1 \u03bcM, and 4%, respectively, whereby a final volume was made 500 \u03bcl.

After 5 ml of Biofluor was added to and mixed with 600 \u03bcl of the recovered supernatant, radioactivity was measured to determine a total binding amount of 3H-mibolerone to the rat androgen receptor. A nonspecific binding amount was determined by adding a DMSO solution containing non-labeled mibolerone instead of the above DMSO so as to be a non-labeled mibolerone final concentration of 40 \u03bcM and conducting the similar operations as above. Difference between the total binding amount and the nonspecific binding amount was regarded as a specific binding amount bound to the androgen receptor.",

From the value and the value determined in (2), IC50 of the inhibitory activity of the compound of the present invention against specific binding of 3H-mibolerone was determined.
