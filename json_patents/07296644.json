The reduction-drive device 201 of FIG. 15 reduces an output of an electric motor 203 to transmit to left and right axle shafts and drive the left and right rear wheels. The electric motor 203 is served as a sub-drive source, and at a side of front wheels, an engine is served as a main drive source, and the left and right front wheels are driven by the engine.",
        "The motor reduction-drive device 201 rotatably supports a first transmission shaft 207, that receives an output of the electric motor 203, at a housing 205 of a stationary side. The first transmission shaft 207 has a reduction gear 211 composing a first reduction mechanism 209. The reduction gear 211 is in mesh with another reduction gear 213 composing the first reduction mechanism 209. The reduction gear 213 is provided to a second transmission shaft 215. The second transmission shaft 215 is disposed in parallel to the first transmission shaft 207, and is rotatably supported to the housing 205.",
        "The second transmission shaft 215 is provided with a reduction gear 219 composing a second reduction mechanism 217. The reduction gear 219 is in mesh with another reduction gear 221 of the second reduction mechanism 217. The reduction gear 221 of the second reduction mechanism 217 is provided to a third transmission shaft 223. The third transmission shaft 223 is disposed in parallel to the first and second transmission shafts 207, 213 and is rotatably supported to the housing 205.",
        "The third transmission shaft 223 is provided with a reduction gear 227 composing a third reduction mechanism 225. The reduction gear 227 is in mesh with a ring gear 229 as another reduction gear of the third reduction mechanism 225. The ring gear 229 is provided to a rear differential 231 as a differential device. A rotating shaft of the rear differential 231 is disposed in parallel to the first, second, third transmission shafts 209, 215, 223. The rear differential 231 is connected in interlocking with the left and right rear wheels via axle shafts.",
        "Accordingly, by driving of the electric motor 203, the first transmission shaft 207 is driven to transmit torque to the second transmission shaft 215 via the first reduction mechanism 209. From the second transmission shaft 215, via the second reduction mechanism 217, the torque is transmitted to the third transmission shaft 223, and is transmitted to the rear differential 231 via the third reduction mechanism 225. From the rear differential 231, via the left and right axle shafts, the torque is transmitted to the left and right rear wheels, and the left and right rear wheels are driven by the electric motor 203.",
        "The front wheel side is driven by the engine as the main drive source. Therefore, it is possible to travel as a hybrid automobile of a four wheel drive.",
        "Further, as the conventional reduction-drive device, there is also a device as shown in FIG. 16. In the same, for simplifying explanation, the composing parts corresponding to those of FIG. 15 will be given the same reference numerals. In the motor reduction-drive device 201A of FIG. 16, the first transmission shaft 207 and the second transmission shaft 215 are coaxially disposed, and the first reduction mechanism 209A is composed with a planet gear mechanism.",
        "Therefore, the output of the electric motor 203 is transmitted to the first transmission shaft 207, reduced at the first reduction 209A, and transmitted to the second transmission shaft 215. The torque transmission after the second transmission shaft 215 is the same as the case of FIG. 15.",
        "However, since the first reduction mechanism 209 and 209A is installed near the electric motor 203, an attaching error of the electric motor 203 gives a direct influence to the first reduction mechanism 209 and 209A, and improvements of acoustic vibration or durability have been limited owing to occurrences of vibration or abnormal sound in the first reduction mechanism 209 and 209A (see, for example, JP-A-2001-287550).",
        "Furthermore, as a conventional reduction-drive device, there is, for example, a device as shown in FIG. 14 (see, for example, JP-A-2003-104073). The motor reduction-drive device 1201 of FIG. 14 reduces an output of an electric motor to transmit to left and right axle shafts and drive, left and right rear wheels. The electric motor is served as a sub-drive source. At a side of front wheels, an engine such as an internal combustion is served as a main drive source, and the left and right front wheels are driven by the engine.",
        "The reduction-drive device 1201 rotatably supports a first transmission shaft 1207 at a housing 1205 of a stationary side. The first transmission shaft 1207 has a reduction gear 1211 composing a first reduction mechanism 1209. The reduction gear 1211 is in mesh with another reduction gear 1215 of the first reduction mechanism 1209. The reduction gear 1215 is supported by a second transmission shaft 1217. The second transmission shaft 1217 is disposed in parallel to the first transmission shaft 1207, and is rotatably supported to the housing 1205.",
        "The second transmission shaft 1217 is provided with a reduction gear 1221 composing a second reduction mechanism 1219. The reduction gear 1221 is in mesh with another reduction gear 1223 of the second reduction mechanism 1219. The reduction gear 1223 is rotatably supported relatively to a differential case 1227 of a rear differential device 1225 via a bearing 1229.",
        "The rear differential device 1225 supports a differential gear mechanism 1231 within the differential case 1227. The differential case 1229 is rotatably supported to the housing 1205 by the bearing 1233.",
        "Transmission and break of torque between the reduction gear 1223 and the differential case 1229 is performed by an electromagnetic clutch 1235 using multi frictional plates.",
        "Accordingly, in case the electromagnetic clutch 1235 is under a torque transmitting condition, if driving an electric motor, a torque reduced through a first and second reduction mechanisms 1209, 1219 is transmitted to a rear differential device 1225. From the rear differential device 1225, the torque is transmitted to left and right axle shafts. By this torque, driving of an engine is helped when starting travel or ascending travel.",
        "When the electric motor is at rest, the electromagnetic clutch 1235 is switched to a torque cutting off condition. Even if, under this switching condition, rotation at the wheel side is transmitted to the rear differential device 1225, the rotation is never transmitted to the first, second reduction mechanisms 1209, 1219 and the electric motor. Therefore, when an output of the electric motor is stopped, the first, second reduction mechanisms 1209, 1219 and the electric motor are never forcibly rotated by the rotation of the wheel side.",
        "For getting high output in the reduction-drive device 1201, this can be in general accomplished by enlarging a scale of the electric motor.",
        "However, there has been a problem that if building such a structure of merely carrying out the high reduction by the first and second reduction mechanisms 1209, 1219, abnormal noises easily occur in the reduction gears 1211, 1215 or the reduction gears 1221, 1223.",
        "It is an object of the invention to accomplish more improve the sound oscillating performance and the durability with less influences by attaching errors of the electric motor, decrease occurrences of vibrations or abnormal noises, and to improve the sound oscillating performance and the durability.",
        "In order to achieve the object, a reduction-drive device according to the present invention comprises a driving source including a transmission shaft; a housing; a first reduction mechanism supported by the housing, for reducing a driving force of the driving source, including a planetary carrier, a planetary gear rotatably supported by the planetary carrier, an internal gear in mesh with the planetary gear, and a sun gear in mesh with the planetary gear; a second reduction mechanism positioned between the driving source and the first reduction mechanism with respect to an axial direction of the transmission shaft, for reducing an output of the first reduction mechanism; and a distribution device supported by the housing, for distributing an output of the second reduction mechanism to a pair of axle shafts.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, the second reduction mechanism may comprise a reduction gear provided on an output side of the first reduction mechanism, and a ring gear provided on a side of the distribution device.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, the reduction gear and the ring gear may be brought in mesh at an inner position with respect to an outermost portion of the first reduction mechanism in a radial direction.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, the transmission shaft may be connected to the sun gear.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, the planetary carrier may be relatively rotatable with respect to the housing, the internal gear is relatively unrotatable with respect to the housing, and the second reduction mechanism may comprise a reduction gear rotating together with the planetary carrier, and a ring gear, provided on a side of the distribution device, in mesh with the reduction gear.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, the planetary carrier may be relatively unrotatable with respect to the housing, the internal gear is relatively rotatable with respect to the housing, and the second reduction mechanism may comprise",
        "a reduction gear rotating together with the internal gear, and a ring gear, provided on a side of the distribution device, in mesh with the reduction gear.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, the planetary gear may comprise plural stepped gears including at least a gear in mesh with the sun gear, and a gear in mesh with the internal gear.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, the planetary gear may comprise a first stepped gear in mesh with the sun gear, and a second stepped gear in mesh with the internal gear.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, the driving source may comprise an electric motor.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, the driving source may be mounted on an automobile having a main driving source for driving one of front and rear wheels, and a sub-driving source for driving the other of the front and rear wheels, and the driving source is the sub-driving source.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, the main driving source may be an internal combustion engine, and the sub-driving source is an electric motor.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, an output shaft of the first reduction mechanism may be coaxially disposed with the transmission shaft and outer side of the transmission shaft.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, the housing may comprise at least a first housing including a first side wall and a second housing including a second side wall, one side of the planetary carrier may be supported by the first housing, and the driving source may be supported by the second housing.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, the one side of the planetary carrier may be rotatably supported by the first side wall via a bearing.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, the other side of the planetary carrier may be supported by the second housing.",
        "The reduction-drive device may further comprise a carrier pin, and the planetary carrier may be unrotatably supported by the first side wall via the carrier pin.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, one of the sun gear and the transmission shaft may be supported by the planetary carrier.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, the second reduction mechanism may comprise a pinion gear provided on an outer side of the first reduction mechanism and a ring gear provided on the distribution device.",
        "The reduction-drive device may further comprise a clutch mechanism provided in a transmission path from the transmission shaft to the axle shaft.",
        "In the reduction-drive device, wherein the distributing device may include a clutch mechanism positioned between the second reduction mechanism and the axle shaft. In the reduction-drive device, wherein a axis of the clutch mechanism may be disposed in parallel with the transmission shaft, and the clutch mechanism and the driving source may be partially overlapped with respect to the axial direction. The reduction-drive device may further comprise a clutch mechanism provided between the first reduction mechanism and the second reduction mechanism.",
        "The reduction-drive device may further comprise a clutch mechanism provided between the distribution device and the axle shaft.",
        "Since the second reduction mechanism is disposed between the electric motor and the first reduction mechanism so as to separate the first reduction mechanism from the electric motor, taking a distance, an error in setting-up of the electric motor may be restrained from effecting to the first reduction mechanism, and it is possible to suppress occurrences of vibrations or abnormal sounds in the first reduction mechanism, and to improve performance of acoustic vibration or durability.",
        "Furthermore, the second reduction mechanism is easily disposed between the electric motor and the first reduction mechanism, and it is possible to reduce the driving force of the electric motor by the first reduction mechanism and transmit the driving force reduced from the planetary carrier of the first reduction mechanism to the second reduction mechanism. The driving force can be further reduced by the reduction gear of the second reduction mechanism and the ring gear, and can be certainly transmitted to the differential device.",
        "Further, the sub-drive source may be reduced in size and in weight. Further, it is possible to improve the sound oscillating performance of the sub-drive source as well as the durability.",
        "Further, it is possible to reduce in size and weight of the motor reduction-drive device of transmitting the driving force to one of the front and rear wheels, and the other drives the other wheel, in the hybrid automobile. Further, it is possible to improve the sound oscillating performance as well as the durability.",
        "In addition, the reduction-drive device can transmit rotating output at high speed of the drive source to the sun gear, and transmit, at reduction speed, high speed rotation of the sun gear from the internal gear via the planetary gear rotatably supported at the carrier provided as one body or integrally to the housing. Accordingly, while enabling the high reduction, it is less to invite occurrence of abnormal noises when gearing owing to improvement of supporting rigidity. Further, since the high speed rotation of the drive source is changed to the high reduction, the high output or the high rotation can be obtained though not making the drive source large scaled, and the heavy weight can be restrained.",
        "Although the sun gear and the output shaft of the drive source more or less deviate from the core by such as an attaching error, this deviation can be absorbed by deflection of the transmission shaft extending till the side of the drive source. Therefore, the engagement between the sun gear and the planetary gear can be steadily performed, enabling to more certainly restrain abnormal noises.",
        "The high speed rotation of the drive source can be reduced in the plural steps between the sun gear and the internal gear, and the drive source can be made smaller in size.",
        "Since the drive source is the sub-drive source with respect to the other main drive source, the sub-drive source may be formed to be small in size and light in weight.",
        "Since the main drive source is the internal combustion engine, and the sub-drive source is the electric motor, and one of the internal combustion engine and the electric motor drives one of the front wheels and the rear wheels, and the other drives the other wheels, it is possible to make small in size and light in weight the reduction-drive device of transmitting drive power force to one of the front wheels and the rear wheels in the four wheel drive automobile.",

The intermittent structure 143 is included in the differential 37 and positioned between the second reduction mechanism 217 and the axle shafts 11, 13.",
        "Especially, an actuator constituted of the brake shoe 133, the spring 135, the slide plate 137 and the electromagnet 139 can be applied not only for a clutch mechanism constituted of the connecting part 121, the gearing part 123, rollers 127 and supporting member 129, but also for the other clutch mechanisms such as a dog clutch and a friction clutch, even if the other clutch mechanisms may be applied to this reduction-drive device. This actuator can perform a good responsiveness and a stable clutch function for various types of clutch mechanism.",
        "Accordingly, by rotation of the electric motor 5, the driving force is transmitted from the output part of the electric motor 5 to the transmission shaft 95. The sun gear 69 rotates thereby integrally and the planetary gear 65 rotates. While the planetary gear 65 is rotating, it revolves by engaging the internal gear 67, and the carrier plates 71, 73 reduce rotation with respect to the transmission shaft 95 through the carrier pin 75.",
        "By the reduced rotation of the carrier plate 73, the reduction gear 85 rotates together, and the torque is transmitted to the ring gear 95. The rotation is also reduced by gearing between the reduction gear 85 and the ring gear 99, so that the torque is transmitted to the differential case 101 at the reduced rotation.",
        "When the intermittent mechanism is connected, the torque is transmitted from the differential case 101 to the inner case 111, and transmitted to the side of the axle shafts 25, 27 via the pinion shaft 113, the pinion gear 115, and the side gears 117, 119 so as to drive the rear wheels 11, 13.",
        "At differential rotation of the rear wheels 11, 13, the side gears 117, 119 play the differential rotation through the rotation of the pinion gear 115, and the differential rotation between the rear wheels 11, 13 is allowed.",
        "When the intermittent mechanism 143 is cut off, even if the inner case 111 rotates, the torque is not transmitted to the differential case 101, and the inner case 111 rotates relatively with respect to the differential case 101.",
        "Intermittence of the intermittent mechanism 143 is performed by controlling conduction to the electromagnet 139. When the electromagnet 139 is conducted, the slide plate 137 is attracted to the side of the electromagnet 139, and closely contacted to the inside of the housing 131. By this close contact, the brake shoe 133 displays frictional resistance to the slide plate 137 and exerts the frictional resistance over the support member 129.",
        "Each of the rollers 127 supported by the support member 129 is effected with rotational control in the rotating direction of the differential case 101 by the support member 129. At this time, if the differential case 101 further rotates, the rotation of the differential case 101 goes ahead of the inner case 111, and the roller engages an engaging face 125.",
        "When the roller 127 engages the engaging face 125, reaction force to the engaging face 123 acts on the connecting part 121 via the roller 127. By this reaction, the engaging part 121 deforms to expand the diameter within a range of elastic deformation, and imparts pressure to the inside of the differential case 101 outside in a direction along the rotating radius.",
        "Owing to this pressure, the frictional engagement is provided between the outside of the engaging face 121 and the inside of the differential case 101.",
        "Accordingly, the frictional engagement between the outside of the engaging face 121 and the inside of the differential case 101 is added to the engagement between the engaging face 123 and the connecting part 121 provided by engaging the roller 127 with the engaging face 125, so that the differential case 101 and the inner case 111 rotate together, and the torque can be transmitted to the side of the rear wheels 11, 13 as mentioned above.",
        "When the conduction to the electromagnet 139 is cut off, the slide plate 137 may rotate relatively to the bearing support 50 of the housing 31.",
        "Since the slide plate 137, the brake shoe 133, and the support member 129 rotate as one body, each of the rollers 127 is not effected with the rotational control, so that it does not engage the engaging face 125. The connecting part 121 is not forced to the inside of the differential case 101, and the inner case 111 does not provide the frictional engagement to the differential case 101, either. Therefore, the inner case 111 is free in relative rotation to the differential case 101.",
        "Under the condition of this relative rotational freedom, when the electric motor 5 is at rest, even if the torque is transmitted from the side of the rear wheels 11, 13 and the axle shafts 25, 27 to the side gears 117, 119, the inner case 111 only rotates via the pinion gear 115 and the pinion shaft 113 from the side gears 117, 119, and the rotation is not transmitted to the differential case 101.",
        "Therefore, the second reduction mechanism 35 may be kept stopped, and the second reduction mechanism 35, the first reduction mechanism 33 and the electric motor 5 never rotate. It is accordingly possible to certainly check large energy loss caused by driving the reduction mechanisms 35, 33 from the reverse direction as well as energy loss by driving the stopped electric motor 5 at the rear wheels 25, 27, and possible to attempt an improvement of a fuel consumption, and heighten the durability of the electric motor 5.",
        "Thus, since such a structure is realized that the second reduction mechanism 35 is arranged between the electric motor 5 and the first reduction mechanism 33 so as to distribute the output of the second reduction mechanism 35 to the rear wheels 25, 27 by means of the rear differential 37, so that one piece of transmission shaft 95 exists at the side of the first reduction mechanism 33 other than the rear differential 37, and it is possible to reduce in size as a whole, and lighten the weight.",
        "Since the second reduction mechanism 35 is disposed between the electric motor 5 and the first reduction mechanism 33 so as to separate the first reduction mechanism 33 from the electricmotor 5, taking the distance, an error in setting-up of the electric motor 5 may be restrained from effecting to a positioning precision of the sun gear 69 of the first reduction mechanism 33, and it is possible to suppress occurrences of vibrations or abnormal sounds in the first reduction mechanism 33, and to improve performance of acoustic vibration or durability.",
        "That is, in the hybrid automobile 1, the motor reduction-drive device 23 for transmitting the motive power to the rear wheels 11, 13 may be reduced in size and lightened in weight. Further, it is possible to improve performance of acoustic vibration or durability.",
        "Beside, since there is the margin of space in the rear differential 37 at the side of the electric motor 5, it is very easy to provide the intermittent mechanism 143 of adding a free differential function to the rear differential 37.",
        "The planetary carrier 63 is rotatably supported to the walls of the housing 31, excellent in supporting rigidity, simple in the mechanism, and less to cause sounds. Reliability may be heightened.",
        "The motor 5 and clutch mechanism 173 are adjacently positioned, interposing the main body 39, so that their axes are disposed in parallel. Further, the first reduction mechanism 33 is positioned on an opposite side of the motor 5 with respect to the axial direction, interposing the second reduction mechanism 35. Thereby, the clutch mechanism 143 and the motor 5 are disposed in an overlap position in which they are partially overlapped in the axial direction. Furthermore, the actuator (constituted of the brake shoe 133, the spring 135, the slide plate 137 and the electromagnet 139) and the motor 5 also are disposed in an overlap position in which they are partially overlapped in the axial direction. Therefore, the reduction-driving device becomes compact in its axial direction.",
        "FIGS. 4, 5A and 5B are concerned with a second embodiment of the invention, and FIG. 4 is a cross sectional view of the motor reduction-drive device, and FIG. 5A is a cross sectional view showing the relation between the connecting part and the engaging part, while FIG. 5B is a simple developing view showing the arrangement of the rollers. By the way, the basic structure is the same as that of the first embodiment, and the corresponding parts are given the same reference numerals for explanation.",
        "The motor reduction-drive device 23A of the present embodiment modifies the connecting part 121A of the intermittent mechanism 143A and the engaging part 123A. The connecting part 121A of this embodiment is provided integrally with the inner case 111A. The engaging part 123A is provided to the differential case 101A. A polygonal engaging face 125A is formed in the inside of the differential case 101A. The rollers 127 are interposed between the connecting part 121A and the engaging part 123A.",
        "Therefore, in this embodiment, if the rollers 127 are effected with rotational control via the supporting member 129, each of the rollers 127 engages the engaging face 125A with respect to rotation of the differential case 101A, so that the differential case 101A and the inner case 111A rotate together.",
        "Releasing the rotational control by the supporting member 129, the engagement of the roller 127 with the gearing face 125A is released, and the side of the inner case 111A may rotate relatively to the differential case 101A.",

        "Next, workings will be explained.",
        "By rotation of the electric motor 1005, the driving force is transmitted from an output shaft 1082 of the electric motor 1005 to the transmission shaft 1084. The sun gear 1069 rotates integrally by this transmission and the planetary gear 1065 rotates. The planetary gear 1065 rotates around the carrier pin 1075 at the stationary side, but it does not revolve. By the rotation of the planetary gear 1065, the internal gear 1067 reduces rotation, and by this rotation, the rotating member 1088 rotates.",
        "By the rotation of the rotating member 1088, the reduction gear 1098 rotates together, and the torque is transmitted to the ring gear 1099. The rotation is also reduced by gearing between the reduction gear 1098 and the ring gear 1099, so that the torque is transmitted to the differential case 1101 at the reduced rotation.",
        "The supporting member 1129 frictionally engages a slide ring 1137 via the brake shoe 1133. By the frictional engagement, the rotation of the supporting member 1129 is delayed with respect to the differential case 1101. By this delay, the rollers 1127 engages an engaging face 1125, so that the differential case 1101 and the inner case 1111 rotate together, enabling to transmit the torque to the rear wheels 1011, 1013 as mentioned above.",
        "When the rotating output of the electric motor 1005 stops, the rotation of the differential case 1101 also stops. Then, the rotation is input from the left and right rear wheels 1011, 1013, and even if the inner case 1111 rotates via the side gears 1117, 1119, the pinion gear 1115, and the pinion shaft 1113, since the roller 1127 makes an idle running in a valley of the engaging face 1125, the roller 1127 does not engage the engage face 1125. Therefore, the inner case 1111 may rotate relatively under freedom to the differential case 1101.",
        "Under this relative rotational freedom, when the electric motor 1005 is at rest, even if the torque is transmitted from the side of the rear wheels 1011, 1013 to the axle shafts 1025, 1027, the side gears 1117, and 1119, the inner case 1111 only rotates via the pinion gear 1115 and the pinion shaft 1113 from the side gears 1117, 1119, and the rotation is not transmitted to the differential case 1101.",
        "Therefore, the second reduction mechanism 1035 may be kept stopped, and the second reduction mechanism 1035, the first reduction mechanism 1033 and the electric motor 1005 never rotate by the rear wheels 1011, 1013. It is accordingly possible to certainly check large energy loss caused by driving the reduction mechanisms 1035, 1033 in the reverse direction as well as energy loss by driving the stopped electric motor 1005 at the rear wheels 1025, 1027, attempt an improvement of a fuel consumption, and heighten the durability of the electric motor 1005.",
        "In such a manner, it is possible to transmit the rotating output at high speed of the electric motor 1005 to the sun gear 1069, and to transmit at reduction the high speed rotation of the sun gear 1069 via the planetary gear 1065 from the internal gear 1067. Accordingly, while performing the high speed reduction, occurrences of abnormal noises are less to cause. Further, since the high speed rotation of the electric motor 1005 is reduced at high speed, the high output may be obtained, though the electric motor is not made large in size, and weight increase may be restrained.",
        "Beside, the carrier 1063 is supported to the stationary side, and since the internal gear 1067 is supported in the boss part 1085 of the carrier 1063 and the wall 1095 of the housing 1031, the supporting rigidity of the internal gear 1067 is high, and the gearing between the internal gear 1067 and the planetary gear 1065 may be certainly made, causing no or little rattling.",
        "Even if the sun gear 1069 and the output shaft 1082 of the electric motor 1005 more or less deviate from the core owing to such as an attaching error, the core deviation can be absorbed by deflection of the transmission shaft 1078 extending till the electric motor. In this case, the intermediate part 1084 of the transmission shaft 1078 is formed to be narrower in diameter than both ends, and therefore the deflection may be accelerated.",
        "Therefore, the core deviation is difficult to extend to the gearing part between the sun gear 1069 and the planetary gear 1065, and in particular, since both sides of the sun gear 1069 is supported to the stationary side by the needle bearing 1080, the ball bearing 1086, and the carrier 1063, the gearing between the sun gear 1069 and the planetary gear 1065 can be certainly made.",
        "Thereby, since the gearing at the first reduction mechanism 1033 causes no rattling or less rattling, abnormal noises can be certainly suppressed from the low speed rotation to the high speed rotation. Further, being no rattling or less rattling, the durability of the device can be improved.",
        "In the second reduction mechanism 1035, the reduction gear 1098 is supported at one side thereof by the housing 1031 via the ball bearing 1093 and the carrier 1063, and is supported at the other side by the housing 1031 via the ball bearing 1097, and therefore, the supporting rigidity is high, and the gearing between the reduction gear 1098 and the ring gear 1099 can be steadily carried out with no or little rattling.",
