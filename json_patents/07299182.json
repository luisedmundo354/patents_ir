        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention generally relates to hand-held devices and, more particularly, to text-to-speech (TTS) for hand-held devices.",
        "2. Background of the Invention",
        "An electronic book (also referred to as an \u201cEbook\u201d) is an electronic version of a traditional print book (or other printed material such as, for example, a magazine, newspaper, and so forth) that can be read by using a personal computer or by using an Ebook reader. Unlike PCs or handheld computers, Ebook readers deliver a reading experience comparable to traditional paper books, while adding powerful electronic features for note taking, fast navigation, and key word searches. However, such actions, irrespective of whether or not they are performed on a PC, handheld computer, or Ebook reader, generally require the user to read the text from a display. Thus, the use of an Ebook generally requires the user to focus his or her visual attention on a display to read the text content (e.g., book, magazine, newspaper, and so forth) of the Ebook. Moreover, the use of any hand-held device requires the user to focus his or her visual attention on a display for one purpose or another.",
        "Accordingly, it would be desirable and highly advantageous to have a hand-held device such as, for example, an Ebook, that allows a user to assimilate content without having to look at a display.",
        "The problems stated above, as well as other related problems of the prior art, are solved by the present invention, a hand-held device having text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities.",
        "According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an Ebook. The Ebook comprises a memory device, a text-to-speech (TTS) module, and at least one speaker. The memory device stores files. The files include text. The TTS module synthesizes speech corresponding to the text. The at least one speaker outputs the speech.",
        "According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for using an Ebook. At least one file is stored in the Ebook. The at least one file includes text. Speech corresponding to the text is synthesized and output from the Ebook.",

        "One or more files (hereinafter \u201cfile\u201d) is input into the Ebook (step 310). The file includes, at the least, text. The file may be provided via a memory device (e.g., floppy disk, compact disk, flash memory, and so forth), downloaded from the Internet, and so forth. The file may be an Ebook application file, an e-mail file, a Web page, a word processor document, and so forth. The file is then stored in the Ebook (step 320).",
        "Optionally, at step 325, a choice is provided to a user of the Ebook to select between a strictly visual mode where the text is displayed on the display, a strictly audio mode where the text is synthesized by the TTS module and output by the speaker, and a combined visual-audio mode where the text is displayed on the display and simultaneously synthesized by the TTS module and output by the speaker (260, 270).",
        "One or more commands are received by the Ebook (step 330). Preferably, the commands correspond to a playback of the file. The commands may include, for example: a command to begin synthesizing speech corresponding to the text included in the file so that the text is reproduced audibly; a command to end the synthesis; a command to preset a start-up time and/or an end time for the speech synthesis; a command to select/change a voice(s) used in the speech synthesis; a command to select/change the speed of the synthesized speech; a command corresponding to navigation through the file (e.g., to skip one or more pages, sections, chapters, and so forth); and so forth.",
        "With respect to the selection of different voices, many different types of voices may be used in the synthesis of speech such as, for example, a man's voice, a woman's voice, an adolescent's voice, or even a funny sounding voice (e.g., chipmunk, etc.). Moreover, different voices may be used in a single playback of a single file. The selection of a particular voice may be made based on, for example, the preference of the user, the different application parameters/circumstances, and/or on a random basis.",
        "Further, it is to be appreciated that some of the commands received at step 330 may not correspond to the playback of the text file. For example, if other functions are integrated with the Ebook such as, for example, a calendar function with a daily reminder schedule, then information relating to the calendar function (or any other function) may be received by the Ebook.",
        "The commands are then acted upon to control operations of the Ebook having TTS capabilities (step 340). Step 340 may include the step of synthesizing speech corresponding to the text and/or displaying the text (step 340a).

        "First and second inputs are received specifying a start time and an end time for a playback of a file on the Ebook (step 410). A third input is received specifying the actual file to be played back (step 420). A fourth input is received specifying a voice for the playback (step 430). It is to be appreciated that steps 420 and 430 may be performed randomly by the Ebook, upon simply receiving the first and second inputs. Alternatively, all (or some combination amounting to less than all) of the inputs may be user provided.",
        "Playback is commenced at the selected start time, including synthesizing speech corresponding to the file so that the text file is audibly reproduced (step 440). Optionally, the text included in the file may be displayed concurrently with the outputting of the synthesized speech. After a random or a pre-specified time period has elapsed, but before the selected end time, the playback volume and/or the speech speed are/is decreased (step 450). Step 450 may be repeated a pre-specified or random number of times so as to gradually decrease the volume and/or speech speed in increments. The reduced playback volume and/or speech speed are intended to render a listener drowsy. The playback is terminated at the specified end time (step 460).",
