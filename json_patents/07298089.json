        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to a high-pressure discharge lamp for emitting light due to a plasma discharge in the presence of a mercury gas atmosphere, and a method of manufacturing such a high-pressure discharge lamp.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "General high-pressure discharge lamps have a lamp bulb of silica glass with a substantially spherical discharge space defined centrally in its longitudinal direction, and a pair of electrodes of tungsten disposed in the discharge space in confronting relation to each other. The discharge space is filled with mercury, a halogen gas, and an inactive gas. The two electrodes are inserted from respective insertion holes defined in the opposite ends of the lamp bulb. The insertion holes are hermetically sealed by rear portion of the respective electrodes which are covered with respective sheets of molybdenum foil serving as a thermal buffer.",
        "When a trigger voltage is applied between the electrodes, a glow discharge is induced between the electrodes in an inactive gas atmosphere in the discharge space, vaporizing the mercury filled in the discharge space. A plasma discharge is generated in a high-pressure mercury gas atmosphere within the discharge space, emitting highly brilliant light of good color-rendering capability.",
        "When the discharge is caused in the discharge space at a high temperature under a high pressure, the tungsten (W) of the electrodes are vaporized and deposited on the inner surface of the bulb wall which defines the discharge space. The conventional high-pressure discharge lamp is therefore problematic in that the tungsten deposited on the inner surface of the bulb wall blackens the bulb wall, lowering the luminance of the discharge lamp. At present, it is customary to encapsulate a halogen gas into the discharge space to prevent the bulb wall from being blackened. The halogen gas filled in the discharge space produces halogen ions which are combined with the vaporized tungsten and deposits the tungsten on the proximal portions of the electrodes at a relatively low temperature. Such a halogen cycle is repeated to prevent the bulb wall from being blackened.",
        "As described above, the halogen gas is effective to prevent the luminance of the discharge lamp from being lowered due to blackening of the bulb wall. However, if the halogen gas is excessively present in the discharge space, then it tends to erode the electrodes and the molybdenum foil, possibly causing the gas to leak from the lamp bulb and rupturing the lamp bulb. There have been developed various techniques for optimizing the concentration of the halogen gas in the discharge space to simultaneously solve the problem of the reduction of the luminance due to blackening and the problem of gas leakage and lamp bulb rupture (see, for example, Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 11-149899 and Japanese patent No. 2829339).",
        "Today, there are demands for high-pressure discharge lamps of smaller size and higher luminance. To meet these demands, it is necessary to either increase the electric power applied to the high-pressure discharge lamps or increase the amount of mercury filled in the discharge space. If the applied electric power or the filled amount of mercury is increased, then an electric power load (thermal load) on the discharge lamp is increased. The electric power load is called a bulb wall load (L) which is expressed by L=P (the electric power applied to the discharge lamp: W)/S (the inner surface area of the bulb wall which defines the discharge space: mm2). Generally, as the bulb wall load L increases, the discharge lamp exhibits a greater tendency to be quickly deteriorated (blackened, whitened, electrodes consumed, etc.) per unit time. The greatest cause of the deterioration is that the halogen cycle does not function properly. Specifically, the halogen cycle functions properly when halogen gas atoms, whose number of moles is greater than the number of moles of tungsten atoms expelled from the electrodes by the discharge, are present in the discharge space. If the number of moles of halogen gas atoms is smaller than the number of moles of tungsten atoms, then the halogen cycle partly fails to function properly, i.e., tungsten atoms occur which cannot be combined with halogen gas atoms. As a result, those tungsten atoms occur which cannot be combined with halogen gas atoms are deposited on the inner surface of the bulb wall which defines the discharge space, causing blackening of the bulb wall. The blackening of the bulb wall induces a reduction in the transparency of the bulb wall (whitening) and an undue consumption of the electrodes.",
        "It is an object of the present invention to provide a high-pressure discharge lamp which sufficiently meets demands for smaller-size, higher-luminance high-pressure discharge lamps, and solves the problems of deteriorations such as blackening and whitening of bulb walls, and the problems of gas leakage and lamp bulb rupture.",
        "If a discharge lamp is cooled under the same conditions, the temperature in a discharge space defined in a lamp bulb of the discharge lamp changes depending on the magnitude of bulb wall load L. That is, as bulb wall load L is greater, the temperature of an inner surface of the bulb wall (hereinafter referred to as bulb wall temperature) which defines the discharge space is higher. Generally, the halogen cycle referred to above begins when the bulb wall temperature exceeds 250\u00b0 C. The halogen effect of each halogen gas is temperature-dependent. Specifically, a chlorine (Cl)-based halogen gas exhibits a good halogen effect in a high temperature range, an iodine (I)-based halogen gas exhibits a good halogen effect in a low temperature range, and a bromine (Br)-based halogen gas exhibits a good halogen effect in a medium temperature range. The halogen cycle becomes more effective as the absolute amount of halogen gases in the discharge space is greater.",
        "The inventor of the present invention has paid attention to the relationship between the temperature-dependency of the halogen effect and the absolute amount of halogen gases, and the halogen cycle, and has made intensity research efforts in order to achieve the above object. As a result of the research, the inventor has completed a high-pressure discharge lamp which properly maintains a halogen cycle irrespective of the magnitude of bulb wall load L and a method of manufacturing such a high-pressure discharge lamp, by determining the type and filled amount of a primary halogen gas based on bulb wall load L which is a standard that is completely different from conventional standards.",
        "Specifically, in a high-pressure discharge lamp according to the present invention, the type and content of a primary halogen gas whose content is the greatest in a mixed halogen gas filled in a discharge space are determined based on a bulb wall load. In a method of manufacturing a high-pressure discharge lamp according to the present invention, the type and content of a primary halogen gas whose content is the greatest in a mixed halogen gas encapsulated in a discharge space are determined based on a bulb wall load, and the lamp bulb is encapsulates the primary halogen gas of the determined type and the determined content separately from, or together with, other halogen gases.",
        "The primary halogen gas should preferably be selected from three halogen gases including an iodine-based halogen gas, a bromine-based halogen gas, and a chlorine-based halogen gas. In addition, for selecting the primary halogen gas, the bulb wall temperature in use is divided into three relative temperature ranges including a low temperature range, a medium temperature range, and a high temperature range. If the bulb wall temperature is in the low temperature range, then the iodine-based halogen gas should preferably be selected as the primary halogen gas. If the bulb wall temperature is in the medium temperature range, then the bromine-based halogen gas should preferably be selected as the primary halogen gas. If the bulb wall temperature is in the high temperature range, then the chlorine-based halogen gas should preferably be selected as the primary halogen gas.",
        "With the high-pressure discharge lamp according to the present invention, and a high-pressure discharge lamp manufactured by the method according to the present invention, the type and content of the primary halogen gas in the mixed halogen gas are determined based on the bulb wall load which changes with the electric power applied to the high-pressure discharge lamp and the amount of mercury filled in the discharge space. More specifically, an appropriate amount of mixed halogen gas containing a primary halogen gas which is most effective under bulb wall load conditions (bulb wall temperature conditions) is encapsulated in the lamp bulb. Since the halogen cycle is properly maintained in the lamp bulb, the high-pressure discharge lamp can solve the problems of various deteriorations of the discharge lamp, such as blackening of the lamp bulb, and the problems of gas leakage and lamp bulb rupture, while meeting demands for smaller-size, higher-luminance high-pressure discharge lamps.",
        "The above and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate examples of the present invention.",

        "FIG. 2 is a diagram showing luminance maintenance percentages measured at the time bulb wall load L was in the range of 0.8\u2266L<1.0 and the content of an iodine-based halogen gas in a mixed halogen gas was changed from 10\u22124 \u03bcmol/mm3 to 10\u22129 \u03bcmol/mm3;",

        "FIG. 1 shows in schematic cross section a high-pressure discharge lamp according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 1, the high-pressure discharge lamp has lamp bulb 1 of silica glass with substantially spherical discharge space 10 defined centrally in its longitudinal direction, and a pair of electrodes 2a, 2b disposed in discharge space 10 in confronting relation to each other. The relationship between inner surface area S (mm2) of the bulb wall defining the discharge space 10 and electric power P (W) applied to the high-pressure discharge lamp is established such that bulb wall load L (W/mm2) is in the range of 0.8\u2266L<1.0.",

The high-pressure discharge lamp according to the present embodiment is an AC high-pressure discharge lamp, and hence electrodes 2a, 2b are identical in shape to each other. If the high-pressure discharge lamp is a DC high-pressure discharge lamp, then electrodes 2a, 2b are different in shape from each other.",
        "Discharge space 10 is evacuated to the extent that the partial pressure oxygen (0) therein is equal to or less than a predetermined value. Discharge space 10 encapsulates mercury (Hg), an inactive gas such as of argon (Ar), or xenon (Xe), and also a mixed halogen gas containing two or more halogen gases.

        "Discharge space 10 is also filled with mercury in the range from 0.12 mg/mm3 to 0.25 mg/mm3 and an inactive gas whose partial pressure ranges from 6.0\u00d710\u22124 Pa to 6.0\u00d710\u22123 Pa, in addition to the mixed halogen gas.",
