        "1. Field of the Invention",
        "The present invention relates to an information processing apparatus, an information processing method, a recording medium, and a program for printing print index data that has been registered on a tabbed area of tabbed paper by using a printer having a tabbed-paper printing function.",
        "2. Description of the Related Art",
        "Conventionally, the user of a printing system or the like has to generate index data that is to be printed on a tabbed area of tabbed paper each time he/she wants to make the printer having the tabbed-paper printing function print the index data. In such a case, the user uses an information processing apparatus that can generate print data for printing the index data on the tabbed paper. Such an information processing apparatus is formed as, for example, a personal computer and is connected to the printer. Accordingly, a printing system including the information processing apparatus and the printer is formed.",
        "Conventionally, for making a printer, which has a tabbed-paper printing function (an index-paper printing function), perform tabbed-paper printing, the user has to generate a document for tabbed paper by using an application operated on a host computer. The document for tabbed paper is printed by the printer driver of the printer. In such a case, the user has to make document into which the document for tabbed paper is to be inserted, separately. Further, after printing both the documents, the user has to insert the document for tabbed paper into the separately-made document at a predetermined position.",
        "Thus, the user has to make both the tabbed-paper document and the document into which the tabbed-paper document is to be inserted. Further, the user has to print both the documents separately and insert the tabbed-paper document into the other document. Performing such procedures is an enormous load on the user.",
        "Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a printing system that can set the details of tabbed-paper printing by using a print-settings screen displayed by a printer driver.",
        "The object of the present invention is to provide a printing system that can register at least one tab data item that has been set by using the print-settings screen displayed by the printer driver and can select desired tab data from the registered tab data for printing. According to the present invention, generally used specific titles to be printed on tabbed paper, such as \u201cSection 1\u201d and \u201cSection 2\u201d can be registered by using the print-settings screen displayed by the printer driver. Further, generic titles corresponding to the specific titles can also be registered with the printer driver. Therefore, the user does not have to generate and register new index data by using the print-settings screen, that is, the GUI of the printer driver, each time he/she wants to have the generally used index data printed.",
        "Another object of the present invention is to reuse the generally used index data that has been registered.",
        "Therefore, an aspect of the present invention is directed to an information processing apparatus for generating print data that is used by a printer for printing. The information processing apparatus comprises a setting unit for setting at least one index data item to be printed on a tabbed area of tabbed paper by the printer. The information processing apparatus further comprises a print-data generation unit for reading the set index data item and generating print data corresponding to the set index data item so that the set data item is printed on the tabbed area of tabbed paper by the printer.",
        "Further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.",
        "FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of a printing system according to an embodiment of the present invention.",

Reference numeral 8 indicates a printer controller (PRTC). The printer controller 8 is connected to the printer 1500 via a predetermined bidirectional interface 21. The printer controller 8 controls communication between the host computer 3000 and the printer 1500.",
        "The CPU 1 performs processing for expanding (rasterizing) an outline font to a display-information RAM area defined in the RAM 2 in order to make the printer 1500 print what is on the CRT 10 in a WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) manner. Further, the CPU 1 opens various kinds of registered windows based on a command issued via a mouse cursor (not shown) or the like on the CRT 10 and performs various kinds of data processing.",
        "For performing printing, a user opens a window relating to printing settings and makes printer settings and print processing method settings for the printer driver. The print-processing method settings include selecting a printing mode.",
        "The printer 1500 is controlled by a printer CPU 12. The printer CPU 12 has a ROM 13 including a font ROM 13a, a program ROM 13b, and a data ROM 13c. The printer CPU 12 performs centralized control over the access with each device connected to a system bus 15 based on a control program or the like stored in the program ROM 13b or a control program or the like stored in an external memory (HD or FD) 14 such as a hard disk, a floppy disk, an IC card, and so forth. Then, the printer CPU 12 outputs an image signal serving as output information to a printing unit (printer engine) 17 connected thereto via a printing-unit interface (I/F) 16.",
        "A control program or the like that can be executed by the printer CPU 12 is stored in the program RAM 13b. Font data (including outline-font data) or the like that is used for generating the above-described output information is stored in the font ROM 13a. When the printer 1500 has no external memory such as a hard disk or the like, information that is used by the host computer 3000 is stored in the data ROM 13c.",
        "An operating unit 1501 is an operating panel provided with switches, an LED display, and so forth (not shown) that are used for performing operations. The printer CPU 12 can communicate with the host computer 3000 via an inputting unit 18. Therefore, the printer CPU 12 can inform the host computer 3000 of the information or the like in the printer 1500.",
        "Reference numeral 19 indicates a RAM mainly serving as a main memory or a work area of the printer CPU 12. The amount of memory of the RAM 19 can be expanded by adding an optional RAM, which is connected to an additional port that is not shown.

        "More than one external memory 14 may be provided. Further, it may be arranged that a plurality of external memories storing an optional font card in addition to the internal font thereof and a program for translating printer control languages of different language systems are connected to the printer 1500. Further, the external memories may have the NVRAM (not shown) and may store printer-mode setting information that is transmitted from an operating unit 1501 for each user or group, for example.",
        "FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating the main functions of the printing system. An application 201, a graphic engine 202, a printer driver 203, and a system spooler 204 in the host computer 3000 are files that are stored in the external memory 11. Further, the application 201, the graphic engine 202, the printer driver 203, and the system spooler 204 are program modules that are loaded into the RAM 2 and executed by an OS or a module that uses the module of the OS.",
        "The application 201 and the printer driver 203 can be added to the HD of the external memory 11 via the FD of the external memory 11, a CD-ROM (not shown), or a network (not shown). The application 201, which is stored in the external memory 11, is loaded into the RAM 2 and is executed. For making the printer 1500 perform printing in a case where the application 201 is used, the graphic engine 202, which is also loaded and executed by the RAM 2, is used for outputting (drawing).",
        "The graphic engine 202 is the drawing means of the OS (operation system). The graphic engine 202 loads each printer driver 203 that is provided for each printer from the external memory 11 into the RAM 2. Then, the graphic engine 202 converts a drawing function (a GDI function in this embodiment) that is an output from the application 201 to a drawing function that can be translated by the printer driver 203 (a DDI function in this embodiment) and transmits the converted drawing function to the printer driver 203. The printer driver 203 converts the DDI function to a printer-control command that can be translated by the printer 1500. The DDI function is the drawing function transmitted from the graphic engine (sometimes referred to as a GDI: a Graphic Device Interface) 202. The printer-control command is transmitted through the system spooler 204, which is loaded into the RAM 2 by the OS, and is output to the printer 1500 via the interface 21.",

Of course, the present invention is not limited to the above-described case. The tabbed paper in FIG. 3A is aligned to be inserted into a document that is to be opened towards the left, for example, even though commercially available sets of paper are not always used for documents that are opened towards the left and other variations are possible with the present invention.",
        "FIG. 3B illustrates the configuration of a first sheet and a second sheet of tabbed paper. As shown in the drawing, each sheet has a projection (an index area) for writing index information thereon, which is attached to one side thereof. The index areas are arranged so that they do not overlap one another. FIG. 3C illustrates a case where index information \u201cNo. 01\u201d is printed on the index area of the first sheet. In this drawing, the index information \u201cNo. 01\u201d is printed in the horizontal direction. However, the index information may be printed in the vertical direction.",
        "FIG. 4A illustrates a case where the tabbed-paper printing function is not yet performed by the printer 1500. On the other hand, FIG. 4B illustrates a case where the tabbed-paper printing function has been performed by the printer 1500. Therefore, FIG. 4A illustrates a case where sheets of tabbed paper are overlaid on one another wherein no information is printed on the index areas of the tabbed papers. FIG. 4B illustrates a case where other sheets of tabbed paper are overlaid on one another after the tabbed-paper printing function is added to the printer 1500. The tabbed paper, excluding the index areas are a standard size. For example, the tabbed paper, excluding the index areas may be letter-sized, A4-sized, and so forth. Therefore, by inserting tabbed paper between pages of a document after the tabbed-paper printing function is added to the printer 1500, it becomes possible to immediately see the categories of the document contents.",
        "When the tabbed-paper printing function is added to the printer 1500, the user of the printer generates index information every time he/she makes a document. FIG. 5 illustrates the details of the tabbed-paper printing function. A graphical user interface (hereinafter referred to as a GUI) in an index-information setting screen shown in FIG. 5 is called up from a print-setting property screen displayed by the printer driver 203. This drawing illustrates a typical text-edit box for inputting text information that is printed on each index area of the 5 sheets of tabbed paper. The user inputs index information \u201cSection 1\u201d, which is printed on a first tabbed sheet, into the uppermost edit box, index information \u201cSection 2\u201d, which is printed on a second tabbed sheet, into the second edit box, index information \u201cSection 3\u201d, which is printed on a third tabbed sheet, into the third edit box, index information \u201cSection 4\u201d, which is printed on a fourth tabbed sheet, into the fourth edit box, and index information \u201cSection 5\u201d, which is printed on a fifth tabbed sheet, into the lowermost edit box.",
        "After inputting the above-described index information in the edit boxes, the user presses an \u201cOK\u201d button shown in the drawing. When the user wants to cancel generation of the index information, the user presses a \u201ccancel\u201d button shown in the drawing. When the \u201cOK\u201d button is pressed, an index-information registering module of the printer driver 203 writes the contents of the index information into a predetermined storage area (for example, DEVMODE) for use at printing time. Thus, according to a first embodiment of the present invention, index information for a plurality of tabs can be stored via a user interface displayed by a printer driver so that the index information can be printed on tabs of tabbed paper. Further, since the index information for the plurality of tabs is registered, the printer driver can generate print data including control commands from the registered index information at printing time. Therefore, tabbed-paper printing can be easily performed as desired by the user.",
        "As has been described in the embodiment above, the index information, which is used when tabbed-paper printing is performed, is set by using the index-information setting screen displayed by the printer driver 203. Further, the index information, that is, the above-mentioned \u201cSection 1\u201d, \u201cSection 2\u201d, \u201cSection 3\u201d \u201cSection 4\u201d, and \u201cSection 5\u201d, is maintained in the predetermined storage area. Therefore, the index information that was stored for the previous tabbed-paper printing can be used again when the next tabbed-paper printing is performed.",
        "However, according to the contents of a document into which the tabbed paper is inserted, the user may determine that other index information including \u201cPart 1\u201d, \u201cPart 2\u201d, \u201cPart 3\u201d, \u201cPart 4\u201d and \u201cPart 5\u201d should be printed on the tabbed paper. That is to say, index information that was set for the previous tabbed-paper printing is not always used for the next tabbed-paper printing.",
        "As has been described, the index information is stored by using the index-information setting screen, which is displayed by the printer driver 203. However, when a tabbed-paper printing function is added wherein the user is required to input the index information, the user must generate the index information every time he/she uses the tabbed-paper printing function.",
        "According to a second embodiment of the present invention, typical index information and frequently used index information can be used repeatedly. Therefore, according to the second embodiment, the user does not need to generate the index information every time he/she uses the tabbed-paper printing function. An index-information reusing processing method according to the second embodiment will now be described.",
        "[Print Control Procedures]",
        "FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate typical user interfaces (GUIs) according to the index-data reusing processing method of the second embodiment. FIG. 6 shows one user interface serving as the index-data setting screen. FIG. 7 shows another user interface serving as an index-data registration screen. The two user interfaces are called up from the print-setting properties screen, which is displayed by the printer driver 203. The user interface shown in FIG. 6 is a screen for selecting index data, to be used for performing tabbed-paper printing, from the previously stored index data. The user interface shown in FIG. 7 is a screen for registering index data that is likely to be used frequently.",
        "By using the user interface shown in FIG. 6, the user selects index data that should be printed on the index area of the tabbed paper from one or more index data items that have been stored (referred to as \u201cspecific-title index\u201d in FIG. 6). The details of the selection will be described later with reference to FIG. 7. The text box \u201cspecific-title index\u201d in FIG. 6 illustrates the registered specific titles. A text box \u201cgeneric-title index\u201d in FIG. 6 shows registered generic titles, which have been registered by using the user interface shown in FIG. 7.",
        "In the text box \u201cspecific-title index\u201d in FIG. 6, the details of \u201cSection N\u201d selected by the user are shown as \u201cSection 1\u201d, \u201cSection 2\u201d, and so forth. Since, in this way, the user can understand the details of the \u201cgeneric title\u201d, he/she can select the most appropriate generic title for a document into which the tabbed paper is to be inserted. When the user presses a \u201cnew registration\u201d button positioned at the lower end of the interface shown in FIG. 6, the user interface shown in FIG. 7 is displayed. The details of an \u201cOK\u201d button and a \u201ccancel\u201d button that are placed at the lower end of the user interface shown in FIG. 6 will be described later. However, it should be noted that the \u201cOK\u201d button is a control button that is used for selecting the generic title and the \u201ccancel\u201d button is another control button that is used for canceling the selected generic title.",
        "By using the user interface shown in FIG. 7, the user generates generic titles for registration (referred to as \u201cregistered generic title\u201d) and the details of the generic title for registration (referred to as a text box \u201cdefinition of specific titles\u201d shown in FIG. 7).",
        "As shown in FIG. 7, a new generic title \u201cproduct catalog 001\u201d is registered in the text box \u201cregistered generic title\u201d. The specific titles of the \u201cproduct catalog 001\u201d, such as \u201cA-series\u201d, \u201cC-series\u201d, and so forth, are registered in the text box \u201cdefinition of specific titles\u201d. Both the text box \u201cregistered generic title\u201d and the text box \u201cdefinition of specific titles\u201d enter a selection mode when the cursor, which is moved by the mouse, is positioned thereon and clicked. Then, the user can input text via the keyboard.",
        "An \u201cOK\u201d button that is provided at the lower end of the user interface, as shown in FIG. 7, is a control button for registering the new generic title and the specific titles. A \u201ccancel\u201d button that is also provided at the lower end of the user interface, as shown in FIG. 7, is another control button for canceling the registration of the new generic title and the specific titles. If the user presses the \u201cOK\u201d button or the \u201ccancel\u201d button, the user interface shown in FIG. 6 is displayed. When the user presses the \u201cOK\u201d button and the new generic title and the specific titles are registered, the new generic title and specific titles, which are registered via the GUI shown in FIG. 7, are stored as an index-data settings file in a predetermined area (more specifically, the system folder in the case where the OS is Microsoft Windows(R)).",
        "Thus, according to the embodiment, the user can register a new generic title. However, by providing a \u201cdelete\u201d button, for example, on the user interface shown in FIG. 6, the user can arbitrarily select one or more generic titles from the \u201cgeneric-title index\u201d and can delete one or more specific titles corresponding to the one or more selected generic titles. The user can edit the specific titles that have been registered. Here, text that is printed on a tab of the tabbed paper is referred to as a \u201cspecific title\u201d, and a group of the specific titles, which are printed on the tabs, is referred to as a \u201cspecific-title group\u201d. A generic title and one or more specific titles that are registered corresponding to the generic title are collectively referred to as \u201ctab data\u201d.",
        "FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating the procedure performed for reusing the index data according to the embodiment. The first half of the flowchart illustrates the procedure that is performed, using a user interface screen that is not shown, for determining the orientation of writing (the horizontal direction, the vertical direction, 180\u00b0 rotation of vertically oriented text, and so forth), the font name, the font size, etc. Such procedures are started by opening the print-setting property screen (not shown) displayed by the printer driver 203 and by pressing a \u201cset tabbed-paper printing details\u201d button (not shown) for opening the GUI shown in FIG. 6.",
        "First, the user selects the tab data used for printing from the previously registered index data by using the user interface shown in FIG. 6 or registers new index data by using the user interface shown in FIG. 7 (Step S801). The descriptions of types of data or information that are selected or registered are omitted since they have been described above. When the user presses the \u201cOK\u201d button in the user interface shown in FIG. 6 after he/she selects a generic name from the \u201cgeneric-title index\u201d, or when the user presses the \u201cOK\u201d button or the \u201ccancel button\u201d in the user interface shown in FIG. 6 after he/she registers new index data by using the user interface shown in FIG. 7 and selects the registered index data by using the user interface shown in FIG. 6, the step advances to step S802.",
        "At step S802, the printer driver 203 determines whether or not reusing of the registered index data is selected at step S801. When the printer driver 203 determines that the reusing was selected, it advances to step S803. Otherwise, the printer driver 203 advances to step S804. The printer driver 203 determines that the reusing of the registered index data is selected when the user selects a desired generic title from the \u201cgeneric-title index\u201d and presses the \u201cOK\u201d button in the user interface shown in FIG. 6.",

Then, the printer driver 203 advances to step S806.",
        "In the case where the number of tabbed papers used for printing is smaller than the number of tabs, the printer driver 203 informs the user of the fact by using a message dialog (not shown). Then, the user determines whether to let the printer driver 203 perform printing or to go back to change the number of tabbed papers by using the message dialog. When the user determines to let the printer driver 203 perform printing, the printer driver 203 can print the registered index data from the first part thereof on the tabbed papers.",

As shown in this drawing, the registered index-data table stores the generic titles, the number of tabs, and text data or the specific titles to be printed on the tabs. Since FIG. 9 illustrates the conceptual configuration of the registered index-data table, the format of the registered index-data table is not limited to that shown in FIG. 9 as long as the table is appropriate for controlling the index data. For example, the table may store the specific titles, numerical values, and so forth, using binary-format representations or XML-format representations. The XML-format representations are structured text-format representations.",
        "When the printer driver 203 determines that the reusing of the index data was not selected at step S802, the step advances to step S804. The printer driver 203 determines whether or not to generate the new index data at step S804. If the printer driver 203 determines to generate the new index data, the step advances to step S805. Otherwise, that is to say, when the user presses the \u201ccancel\u201d button in the user interface shown in FIG. 6, the printer driver 203 stops operating for reusing the index-data.",
        "If the printer driver 203 determines to generate the new index data at step S804, the step advances to step S805. At step S805, an index-data registration module (not shown) of the printer driver 203 stores the index data, that is, the tab data, that is newly registered by using the user interface shown in FIG. 7 in the registered index-data table. The tab data includes the text, that is, the specific titles that are to be printed on the tabs of the sheets of tabbed paper, the tab number, and the generic title of the specific titles.

        "At step S806, the printer drier 203 generates print-job data based on the index data that has been determined at step S803, or at step S805, for printing the determined index data onto the tabbed paper. Then, the step advances to step S807. At step S807, the printer driver 203 outputs the print-job data, which is generated at step S806, to the system spooler 204 of the OS, thereby terminating the process of reusing the index data. The system spooler 204 transmits the print-job data to the printer 1500. Upon receiving the print-job data, the printer 1500 prints the index data on the sheets of tabbed paper.",
        "The details of a process of generating an index job (S806) shown in FIG. 8 will be described. FIG. 10 illustrates a typical graphical user interface for determining positions in the document where the sheets of tabbed paper are to be inserted. Each item of the index data (represented by the first to fifth tabs shown in FIG. 10) is printed on the corresponding sheet of tabbed paper. When tabbed-paper printing is selected by the user via the print-setting properties screen, which is displayed by the printer driver 203, for printing a document that is made by using the application 201, the user can determine the positions in the document where the sheets of tabbed paper are to be inserted.",
        "By using the graphical user interface shown in FIG. 10, the user can determine the positions in the document, which is made by using the application 201, where the sheets of tabbed paper are to be inserted.",
        "Accordingly, the user can make the printer 1500 perform printing after he/she determines the positions in the document where the sheets of tabbed paper are to be inserted. Then, at step S806 where an index job is generated, the printer driver 203 receives a plotting function (a DDI function). The DDI function is obtained by converting a plotting function (a GDI function) via the graphic engine 202. The GDI function is generated by the application 201. Then, the printer driver 203 converts the DDI function into a page-description language (a PDL) per page.",
        "The printer driver 203 compares the pages of the document, which is transmitted from the application 201, and the pages shown in the user interface shown in FIG. 10. If the printer driver 203 determines that one of the pages corresponds to one of the set pages shown in FIG. 10, the printer driver 203 reads index data corresponding to the set page from the tab data in the registered index-data table. The printer driver 203 further reads items of index data corresponding to each tab number and generates a PDL. Here, the printer driver 203 generates and enters a tabbed-paper print command because the page on which the index data is printed is a tabbed-paper sheet. Because, even though the printer 1500 performs regular printing upon receiving the PDL, for the page for which the tabbed-paper print command is entered, the printer 1500 unarchives the PDL, generates and prints a bit-map image on the tabbed-sheet at a shifted position. The image is formed by, for example, charging in the case where an electrophotographic printer is used, or spraying ink in the case where an ink jet printer is used.",
        "Thus, for the page that has been set by the user interface shown in FIG. 10, the printer driver 203 generates the print-job data by entering the tabbed-paper print command and generating the PDL.",
        "According to this embodiment, for generating the specific titles which are to be printed on the tabbed area of tabbed paper, the user can select desired specific titles from the registered specific-title group including generally used specific titles, such as \u201cSection 1\u201d, \u201cSection 2\u201d, and so forth. Otherwise, the user can register new index data and select desired index data therefrom. Subsequently, the user can reuse generally used or frequently used index data without generating new data each time the tabbed-paper printing is performed. That is to say, the reduction of the tabbed-paper printing procedures benefits offices where large-volume documents are printed and the near-print publication industry.",
        "The present invention can be used for a system including a plurality of apparatuses, such as a host computer, an interface, a reader, and a printer. Further, the present invention can be used for an apparatus, such as a copier, a printer, or a facsimile machine.",
        "In the above-described embodiment, the specific titles are printed on the tabbed area of the tabbed paper. However, other index data, such as a bar code, or an image may be printed.",
        "Further, a recording medium storing the program code of software that achieves the above-described functions may be supplied to a print-control apparatus or a print-control system. Then, a computer (or a CPU or a MPU) included in the print-control apparatus may read the program code and may execute it for achieving the object of the present invention.",
        "Thus, the program code that is read from the recording medium achieves the new functions of the present invention. Therefore, in such a case, the recording medium storing the program code serves as the component of the present invention.",
        "The recording medium for storing the program code may be a floppy disk, a hard disk, an optical disk, a magneto-optical disk, a CD-ROM, a CD-R, a magnetic tape, a nonvolatile memory, or a ROM.",
        "As discussed, the above-described functions can be achieved by executing the program code read by the computer. However, an OS operated on the computer based on the instructions of the program code may perform part of the procedures or all the procedures for achieving the functions of the present invention.",
        "Further, when the program code read from the recording medium is stored in an expansion board provided in the computer or in a memory provided in an expansion unit connected to the computer, a CPU in the expansion board or the expansion unit may perform part of the procedures or all the procedures for achieving the functions of the present invention.",
        "While the present invention has been described with reference to what are presently considered to be the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions.",
        "As has been described, according to the present invention, a desired information group can be selected from information groups that have been registered in storing means and the output data of the selected information group can be printed on paper at a predetermined position. Therefore, the output data of the registered information groups can be reused. Since the user does not have to reenter the output data of the registered information for printing, reduction of the printing procedures is achieved."
