    "description": [
        "The invention relates to a process for preparing a synergistic stabilizer mixture based on polyalkyl-1-oxadiazaspirodecane compounds.",
        "It is known that organic materials are damaged by light, radiation, heat or oxygen.",
        "There are already numerous documents describing compounds for stabilizing organic materials against the effects of light and heat. Some of them relate to compounds based on 2,2,6,6-tetraalkylpiperidines. To afford effective protection, these stabilizers must be present at a sufficient concentration particularly at the exposed sites of the organic material.",
        "The low molecular mass representatives of the 2,2,6,6-tetraalkylpiperidine class have the advantage of migrating rapidly to the sites that are especially subject to the damaging influences, where they unfold their protective effect. They have the dis-advantage, however, that their volatility is too high and they are readily extractable from the organic material.",
        "The higher molecular mass representatives of this class, although not so readily extractable, have the disadvantage of being slower to migrate. Within the art this problem is often solved by employing a mixture of low (rapidly migrating) and high (slowly migrating) molecular mass stabilizers.",
        "Accordingly, a considerable number of stabilizer mixtures based on sterically hindered amines are known from which the disadvantages depicted are largely or completely absent.",
        "As representative examples mention may be made of mixtures as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,692,486, U.S. Pat. No. 4,863,981, U.S. Pat. No. 4,957,953, U.S. Pat. No. 5,980,783, WO 92/12201, WO 94/22946, EP 449 685 A, EP 623 092 A, GB 2 267 499 A, and in Research Disclosure No. 34549 (January 1993).",
        "There nevertheless continues to be a high demand for new, more powerful stabilizer mixtures which give organic materials enhanced light stability or service properties.",
        "U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,940 describes a synergistic stabilizer mixture of the general formulae (I), (II) and (III) based on polyalkyl-1-oxadiazaspirodecane compounds, compound (I) being present in a fraction of 65-95%, preferably from 75 to 94%, in particular from 85 to 94% by weight, compound (II) in a fraction of from 5 to 35%, preferably from 5 to 20%, in particular from 5 to 12% by weight, and compound (III) in a fraction of from 0 to 10%, preferably from 1 to 5%, in particular from 1 to 3% by weight",

        "In U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,940, the mixture described is prepared by combining components (I), (II) and, where appropriate, (III) in the desired proportion.",
        "This operation may take place, for example, in a powder mixer, in which the substances are mixed in dry form. Additionally or alternatively, the powder mixture can be homogenized by melting, under inert gas if necessary. The mixing operation may also be performed with the aid of a solvent, which after the components have been homogenized in solution is removed again by evaporation.",
        "A procedure of this kind for preparing the mixture of components (I), (II) and (III) has the decisive disadvantage that it is time consuming, complex and costly, since each individual component must first of all be prepared independently and then, in a further, physical process operation, must be admixed in the correct, synergistic proportion.",
