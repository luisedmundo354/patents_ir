        "This invention relates generally to an enclosure and more particularly, to a retractable sports enclosure.",
        "Various sports, including baseball, softball, and golf, for example, are played on relatively large outdoor fields. The playing fields may be utilized by several different groups of athletes for practice and/or actual games. And as such, the availability of playing fields may be limited by game and/or practice schedules. Furthermore, inclement weather may limit the use of outdoor playing fields.",
        "Accordingly, outdoor sports teams may practice in indoor facilities. Within such facilities, netted enclosures may be used to contain the balls to prevent danger to other persons, damage to property, and/or losing balls during practice sessions. Such enclosures are generally sized large enough to allow a person or persons to practice, while still being portable to facilitate the enclosure structure being moved from one practice location to another, or to a storage location.",
        "For example, at least one known sports enclosure utilizes a plurality of folded frame sections. To expand the enclosure, a net is attached to the support frame and is lowered over the assembled frame using a rope. To retract the enclosure, the net is either folded over the top of the support frame prior to the frame being moved, or is removed from the frame to enable modular frame sections to be collapsed and folded.",
        "At least one other known sports enclosures utilizes a net permanently attached to a plurality of frame sections. The sports enclosure is not expanded or retracted, but rather, the entire enclosure is lowered onto a floor surface when utilized by athletes for practice, and then raised overhead and remains suspended within the sports facility until the enclosure is again required for practice. Accordingly, assembling and retracting such enclosures may be a time consuming and burdensome task that may require the cooperative effort of several people.",
        "In one aspect, a method for assembling a sports enclosure is provided. The method includes coupling a driving gear to an upper support structure, coupling a net having an upper edge and a lower edge to the upper support structure such that an enclosure is at least partially defined by the net, and coupling the lower edge of the net to the driving gear such that operation of the driving gear raises the net such that the net is folded in an accordion like manner between the upper support structure and the lower edge of the net.",
        "In another aspect, a method for operating a sports enclosure is provided. The method includes activating a driving gear to selectively raise a net including a net lower edge such that the net is folded in an accordion like manner between the upper support structure and the net lower edge.",

In one embodiment, gear drives 22 are beveled gear drives that couple drive shaft 14 to shafts 16 and 18, such that shafts 16 and 18 are substantially perpendicular to shafts 14 and 20.

As net lower edge 71 and lower support structure 30 transition towards upper support structure 202, net 64 is folded in an accordion like manner. In the exemplary embodiment, gearbox 40 remains activated until lower support structure 30 contacts a switch 76, i.e. when lower support structure 30 is proximate to and approximately parallel with upper support structure 202 as shown in FIG. 4. In an alternative embodiment, gearbox 40 remains activated until a user selectively de-energizes power to gearbox 40.",
        "To lower sports enclosure 200, gearbox 40 is energized to cause grooved winch drums 46 to rotate in a second direction 78 that is opposite first direction 74. Cables 214 are unwound from grooved winch drums 46 causing lower support structure 30 to transition away from upper support structure 202. As lower support structure 30 and upper support structure 202 are separated, net 64 is unfolded until net 64 is suspended substantially unfolded between upper and lower support structures 202 and 30, respectively. In the exemplary embodiment, gearbox 40 remains activated until a switch 80 is activated, i.e. when lower support structure 30 is proximate to and approximately parallel to a floor surface.",
        "The sports enclosures described herein are each portable and self-standing. Moreover, each enclosure can be extended open and retracted closed automatically without prefolding the net. When opened, the sports enclosure provides a large enclosed area for sports practice and games. When closed, the enclosure can be stored in an overhead of a sports facility in a fully retracted position. The sports enclosure enables a single user to setup or retract the enclosure using the motor driven gearbox. For example, since the enclosure net is coupled to both the upper support structure and the lower support structure, activating the motor driven gearbox raises the entire enclosure without requiring a user to fold the net over the frame. Accordingly, additional users are not required to retract or setup the enclosure. Further, a plurality of sports enclosures can be coupled together to form a single sports enclosure. For example, at least two sport enclosures can be combined be raising a single side net of each individual sports enclosure. The enclosures can then be coupled to form a single enclosure that includes an area defined by the nets that is approximately twice the area of a single sports enclosure.",
        "Exemplary embodiments of sports enclosures are described above in detail. The sports enclosures are not limited to the specific embodiments described herein, but rather, components of each assembly may be utilized independently and separately from other components described herein. For example, each motor driven gearbox and driving shaft can also be used in combination with other enclosure assembly components described herein.",
        "While the invention has been described in terms of various specific embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the claims."
