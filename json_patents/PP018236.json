        "The present invention comprises a new and distinct cultivar of campanula, botanically known as Campanula hybrid, and hereinafter referred to by the cultivar name \u2018Camp Bule\u2019. The new cultivar originated from a hybridization made in May 1995 in Andijk, The Netherlands. The female parent was \u2018CR-37-2\u2019, a proprietary (unpatented) interspecific blue-flowered campanula plant, while the male parent was \u2018CR-40-2\u2019, a proprietary (unpatented) interspecific blue-flowered campanula plant. The seeds produced by the hybridization were sown in February 1996, and the resulting seedlings were selected in July 1996. A single plant selection was chosen for further evaluation and for asexual propagation in 1997.",
        "The new cultivar was created in 1995 in Andijk, The Netherlands and has been asexually reproduced repeatedly by vegetative cuttings and tissue in Andijk, The Netherlands over a nine-year period. \u2018Camp Bule\u2019 has also been trialed at Hillscheid, Germany. The present invention has been found to retain its distinctive characteristics through successive asexual propagations.",
        "Plant Breeder's Rights for this cultivar were applied for in Canada on Mar. 21, 2006 and with the European Union on Jan. 24, 2005.",
        "The following are the most outstanding and distinguishing characteristics of this new cultivar when grown under normal horticultural practices in Andijk, The Netherlands and Hillscheid, Germany.\n\n    \n    \n        1. Small to medium-sized blue-violet, bell-shaped flowers;\n        2. Floriferous with the flowers borne well-above the foliage;\n        3. An early flowering response;\n        4. Deep green and slightly glossy foliage with small, cordate leaves;\n        5. A compact, well-branched plant habit; and\n        6. A mainly tight and bushy, later partly decumbent growth habit.",
        "This new campanula plant is illustrated by the accompanying photograph which shows overall plant habit including blooms, buds, and foliage of the plant; the colors shown are as true as can be reasonably obtained by conventional photographic procedures. The photograph is of 5-month-old plants grown in a greenhouse in Andijk, The Netherlands in May 2003.",
        "The following detailed description sets forth the distinctive characteristics of \u2018Camp Bule\u2019. The data which define these characteristics were collected from asexual reproductions carried out in Andijk, The Netherlands. The plant history was taken partly on 5-week old plants, still in a vegetative state and grown in Hillscheid, Germany. Rooted cuttings were planted in 10.5-cm pots and grown in a greenhouse. The plants were not pinched. Flower observations were made on 35-week-old plants in fall of 2005. Color readings were taken under natural light. Color references are primarily to The R.H.S. Colour Chart of The Royal Horticultural Society of London (R.H.S.) (2001).",
