No. 10/783,946, filed Feb. 20, 2004, now abandoned entitled \u201cDRAW RESONANT RESISTANT MULTILAYER FILMS,\u201d naming inventors Kevin G. Hetzler, Viktor Skatchkov, and Xixian Zhou, which application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.",
        "This disclosure, in general, relates to draw resonant resistant multilayer films, methods for manufacturing same and articles including same.",
        "Increasingly, manufacturers are turning to polymers to create surfaces that are resistant to chemical and environmental damage. For example, fluorinated polymers exhibit a resistance to damage caused by exposure to chemicals, such as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), a resistance to stains, and a resistance to damage caused by exposure to environmental conditions. Such polymers have been used in applications such as airplane and train cargo hold liners, vinyl siding surface treatments, and photovoltaic protective coverings.",
        "However, processing of such films for use in these applications is difficult. Line speed in production is often limited by the appearance of draw resonance at relatively low line speeds, such as below 50 feet per minute. These processing limitations increase costs and reduce the availability of these beneficial films. As such, robust multilayer films having preferred mechanical and processing properties are generally desirable in the art.",
        "In one particular embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a multilayer film comprising a first polymer layer and a second polymer layer. The first polymer layer comprises a blend of a first fluoropolymer having a first average molecular weight and a second fluoropolymer having a second average molecular weight. The first average molecular weight is greater than the second average molecular weight.",
        "In a further embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a multilayer polymeric film comprising a first polymer layer and a second polymer layer. The first polymer layer comprises a fluoropolymer having a bimodal molecular weight distribution.",
        "In another embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a multilayer film comprising a polymeric layer including a first fluoropolymer having a first average molecular weight and a second fluoropolymer having a second average molecular weight. The first average molecular weight is greater than the second average molecular weight. The multilayer film is adapted to be drawn at a linespeed of at least about 50 ft/min with a thickness variance no more than about 5%.",
        "In a further embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a method of manufacturing a multilayer film. The method includes extruding a first polymer layer and extruding a second polymer layer. The first polymer layer comprises a blend of a first fluoropolymer having a first average molecular weight and a second fluoropolymer having a second average molecular weight. The first average molecular weight is greater than the second average molecular weight.",
        "Further aspects of the disclosure are found in a multilayer polymeric film comprising a first polymer layer and a second polymer layer. The first polymer layer comprises a fluoropolymer having a bimodal molecular weight distribution of molecules and the first polymer layer has a melt phase tensile strength at least about 50% greater than the melt phase tensile strength of the second layer.",
        "The present disclosure may be better understood, and its numerous objects, features, and advantages made apparent to those skilled in the art by referencing the accompanying drawings.",
        "FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 depict exemplary embodiments of multilayer films.",
        "FIG. 4 depicts extensional velocity data for exemplary film components.",
        "The use of the same reference symbols in different drawings indicates similar or identical items.",
        "In a particular embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a multilayer film typically including a layer having properties useful for the processing of the multilayer film and a layer having properties that provide mechanical properties in the resulting multilayer film. The multilayer film may further include a layer that provides desirable surface properties. These surface properties may include chemical resistance or adhesiveness. In one exemplary application, the multilayer film may be used in fluoropolymer processing.",
        "FIG. 1 depicts an exemplary multilayer film. The exemplary film 100 has two layers, 102 and 104. Layer 102 includes a polymer or polymer blend that provides processing characteristics and desired processing behaviors. Layer 104 includes a polymer or polymer blend that provides desired mechanical properties and behaviors exhibited in the resulting multilayer film.",
        "Layer 102 includes a polymer or polymer blend that exhibits desirable processing properties or behaviors in a melt phase. In one exemplary embodiment, the polymer or polymer blend may exhibit melt strain hardening behavior at a given draw ratio or within a given draw ratio domain. In another exemplary embodiment, a polymer or polymer blend may exhibit a higher melt-phase tensile force for a given draw ratio. In one particular embodiment, the polymer of layer 102 may include a melt stain hardening acrylic. In another exemplary embodiment, the polymer or polymer blend may include a polymer having a relatively high molecular weight distribution and exhibiting a relatively high melt-phase tensile force.",
        "Layer 102 may comprise a polymer component exhibiting melt strain hardening at processing conditions. Melt strain hardening is exhibited when the melt-phase tensile force smoothed slope relative to a draw ratio domain is significantly positive for a polymeric component. In one exemplary embodiment, the melt strain hardening component is a non-polyolefin polymer that exhibits melt strain hardening at draw ratios greater than 10:1. In another exemplary embodiment, the melt strain hardening component is a non-polyolefin polymer component exhibiting a melt-phase tensile force smoothed slope in the melt phase of greater than about 0.03 cN between the draw ratios of between 0 and greater than 30:1. For example, the melt-phase tensile force to draw ratio slope may be greater than about 0.04 cN in the draw ratio domain between about 10:1 to about 20:1 or about 10:1 to about 15:1. In another embodiment, the melt strain hardening component may exhibit increasing smoothed melt-phase tensile force in the draw ratio domain between about 5:1 and about 30:1, such as between about 10:1 and about 15:1 or between about 20:1 and about 30:1. In a further exemplary embodiment, the melt strain hardening polymer exhibits melt strain hardening in which the polymer exhibits a positive ratio of change in melt-phase tensile force to change in draw ratio in the draw ratio domain of between a first draw ratio and a second draw ratio, wherein the damage resistant polymer may exhibit a melt plateau in the same domain.
