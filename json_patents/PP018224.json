        "The present invention relates to a new and distinct variety of peach tree named \u2018NJ351\u2019. Our new tree resulted from crossing \u2018NJ304\u2019 as the seed parent with \u2018J19-19-862144\u2019 peach tree, as the pollen parent. The new variety differs from seed parent \u2018NJ304\u2019 (unpatented) in that the new variety has firm fruit with yellow flesh while the parent has soft fruit with white flesh. The new variety differs from pollen parent \u2018J19-19-862144\u2019 (unpatented) in that the new variety has fruit with a bright ground color and yellow flesh, while the parent has fruit with a slight green ground color and white flesh. The resulting tree was selected when growing in a cultivated area as the 34th tree in the 40th row of Block K in Cream Ridge, N.J.",
        "The \u2018NJ351\u2019 variety is distinguished from other peach varieties due to the following unique combination of characteristics: Fruit with an attractive red skin color.\n\n    \n    \n        Fruit with a bright golden-yellow ground color.\n        Fruit with a sweet, low acid flavor.\n        Very firm fruit that retain their firmness well.\n        Regular and heavy production of fruit.",
        "The variety was asexually reproduced at the Rutgers Fruit Research and Extension Center in Cream Ridge, N.J. Asexual reproduction of this new variety by budding onto \u2018Lovell\u2019 rootstock (unpatented) shows that the foregoing characteristics are so reproduced.",
        "The following detailed description concerns the original tree, \u2018NJ351\u2019. The original tree and progeny have been observed growing in a cultivated area in Cream Ridge, N.J. Certain characteristics of this variety, such as growth and color, may change with changing environmental conditions (such as, light, temperature, moisture, nutrient availability) or other factors. Color descriptions and other terminology are used in accordance with their ordinary dictionary descriptions, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Color designations are made with reference to The Royal Horticultural Society (R.H.S.) Colour Chart.",
        "FIG. 1 is a color photograph taken on Aug. 29, 2005 of a characteristic twig of \u2018NJ351\u2019 in late summer bearing typical leaves of the mature foliage.",
        "FIG. 2 is a color photograph of mature fruit of \u2018NJ351\u2019 and stones harvested in Cream Ridge, N.J. on Aug. 29, 2005. Whole fruit are presented in two positions and transverse and longitudinal cross sections to show that the pericarp comes free from the pit when the fruit is mature. The stones illustrate the medium, narrow dorsal ridge on the stone and the chains of pits forming grooves on the surface of the stone.",
        "FIG. 3 is a color photograph of a characteristic twig that illustrates the typical flower buds and small, non showy flowers of \u2018NJ351\u2019 observed on a tree in Cream Ridge, N.J. on Apr. 21, 2004.",
        "FIG. 4 is a color photograph of a tree of \u2018NJ351\u2019 in early fall that illustrates the spreading growth habit of a tree in Cream Ridge, N.J. on Oct. 27, 2005.",
        "FIG. 5 is a color photograph taken on Oct. 27, 2005 of immature bark of \u2018NJ351\u2019 that illustrates color and the moderate density of elongated lenticels on the immature bark.",
        "FIG. 6 is a color photograph taken on Oct. 27, 2005 of mature bark of \u2018NJ351\u2019 that illustrates the fairly smooth texture and prominent lenticels of the mature bark.",
        "The colors of and illustration of this type may vary with lighting and other conditions under which conditions and, therefore, color characteristics of this new variety should be determined with reference to the observations described herein, rather than from these illustrations alone.",
        "The following detailed description of the \u2018NJ351\u2019 variety is based on observations of the original seedling tree.
