As later referenced herein, the power source output values of the batteries may comprise either the voltage, current or both.",
        "Regulated power supply apparatus 47 receives the 6V electrical power from the batteries at connector P1 and converts the voltage to 3.3V DC of regulated power output which is supplied to the remaining circuitry (except for the motor drive circuit) at the point represented by reference number 575. Regulated power supply apparatus 47 is actually connected to the points labeled 3.3V throughout FIGS. 16B-16C. The circuitry and operation of regulated power supply apparatus 47 is well-illustrated in FIG. 16A and is known to those skilled in the art of electronic circuitry. The batteries can be replaced by another source of DC power such as a transformer and AC-to-DC conversion circuitry.",
        "Referring next to FIGS. 15 and 16B, free running oscillator 501 has a frequency which depends on the electrical capacitance of sensor 337. The capacitance of sensor 337 is changed by the presence of a user's hand in proximity to sensor 337. Oscillator 501 generates an oscillating voltage signal at point 551 of FIG. 16B. The oscillating voltage at point 551 is at a nominal frequency of approximately 6.1 MHZ when a user is not in proximity of sensor 337. This is referred to as the idle state.",
        "Referring further to FIGS. 15 and 16B, the oscillating voltage signal output of oscillator 501 is passed through the frequency divider 503. Frequency divider 503 includes a ripple counter 509 and is configured to divide the oscillating voltage at point 551 by 4096. This generates a logical-level square wave divider output signal at point 577 of FIGS. 16B and 16C with a nominal frequency of about 1.5 kHz. Ripple counter 509 is preferably a Model 74VHC4040 12-stage binary counter available from Fairchild Semiconductor of South Portland, Me. The frequency of divider output signal at point 577 is changed by the presence of a user's hand in proximity to sensor 337, referred to as the detection state. In general, the presence of a user's hand lowers the frequency of oscillator 501 and therefore the frequency of the divider output signal at point 577.",
        "Referring to FIGS. 15, 16C and 17, the divider output signal at point 577 is an input to micro-controller 511 pin 14. A portion of the firmware instructions which are contained within micro-controller 511 serve as detector logic 601 to generate a detector flag 603 to indicate the presence of a user's hand.",
        "A further input to micro-controller 511 is provided by a sheet material length selecting circuit 517 which includes connector P3 used to receive jumpers (not shown). Pins 2 and 6 of P3 are normally held to a logical \u201clow\u201d read by the instructions in micro-controller 511 as a 12-inch towel length. Pin 4 of P3 is held \u201chigh\u201d by pin 19 of micro-controller 511. When a jumper is used to connect either pin 2 or pin 6 to pin 4 of connector P3, micro-controller 511 interprets these jumper settings as 10-inch and 14-inch towel lengths respectively.",
        "FIG. 16D is a schematic of the portion of control apparatus 50 circuitry connected to the outputs of micro-controller 511. These outputs include the internal and external LED's 581, 583 respectively and drive motor 267. Portions of FIG. 16C are connected to portions in FIG. 16D as indicated by common labeling. Drive motor 267 is attached to connector P2 in FIG. 16D. Resistor R2 is the current-sensing resistor used to provide a voltage signal for A/D conversion to yield a measurement of motor current-sensing voltage Vcurr proportional to the motor current. Field effect transistor (FET) Q1 is used to switch sufficient current for drive motor 267.",
        "The logic of control apparatus 50 will be now be described with reference to the flow diagrams of FIGS. 17-19F. Such logic is in the form of the set of instructions residing in the memory of micro-controller 511. The logical steps which result in detection of a user represent detector logic 601, will first be described with reference to FIGS. 17 and 18. Thereafter, the remaining logical steps for operation of dispenser 10 will be explained in connection with FIGS. 19A-19F.",
        "Referring then to FIG. 17, detector logic 601 operates as follows: Divider output signal 577 (FIGS. 15, 16B and 16C) delivered to micro-controller 511 from proximity detector 49. Logic module 605 of instructions residing in memory of micro-controller 511 converts output signal 577 to a stream of detector counts represented by symbol Yd. Each count has a value which is equal to the number of micro-controller clock cycles (at a clock frequency fc) in a fixed number Nd of cycles of divider output signal 577 (with a frequency fd). The stream of detector counts Yd is a sequential series of numbers each of which is determined by the following relationship:\n\nYd=Nd\u00b7fc/fd\n\nThe symbol Yd is used to represent both the stream of count values as well as each individual count in the stream. Stream of detector counts Yd is also later referred to as the output signal.",
        "For example, if the frequency fd of divider output signal 577 is 1.5 kHz, with a clock frequency fc of 1 MHz and a value of Nd of 135, the value of a detector count Yd=135\u00b71,000,000/1,500=90,000. The stream of values Yd has a new value every Nd/fd seconds.",
        "Stream of detector counts Yd is input to two digital low-pass filters, a detector low-pass filter 607 and a baseline low-pass filter 609. Each digital low pass filter 607, 609 is in the form of firmware residing in micro-controller 511.",
        "Each of low-pass filters 607, 609 operates as follows: During start-up, the initial low-pass filter output value is set as the initial input value of stream of detector counts Yd. In the embodiment described, the symbol F generally represents the low-pass filter output value and the symbol Fi represents the value of F during any cycle \u201ci\u201d and Fi+1 is the value of F during the following cycle. Thereafter, for each new value of Yd, low-pass filter output value F is a stream of values determined as follows:\n\nFi+1=W\u00b7Yd+(1\u2212W)\u00b7Fi\n\nwhere the symbol W is the weight of the filter. A typical value for W for the detector low-pass filter is Wd=\u00bd, and a typical value for W for the baseline low-pass filter is Wb1= 1/64. Thus, the two low-pass filters operate as follows:\n\nDetector low-pass filter 607: DFi+1=\u00bd\u00b7Yd+\u00bd\u00b7DFi\n\nBaseline low-pass filter 609: BLFi+1= 1/64\u00b7Yd+ 63/64\u00b7BLFi\n\nThe values of the outputs of the low-pass filters DF and BLF are similar to the stream of detector counts Yd; that is, they are a sequential series of values, such values being in the numerical range of stream of detector counts Yd.",
        "Digital low-pass filters 607, 609 each have time constants which are equal to 1/W cycles, expressed as time constant \u03c4=(1/W)\u00b7Nd/fd seconds. That is, the time constant \u03c4b1f of baseline low-pass filter 609 with a weight Wb1= 1/64 is 64 cycles or 64\u00b7135/1,500 seconds or about 5.76 seconds. Similarly, detector low-pass filter 607 with a weight Wd=\u00bd has a time constant \u03c4df of about 0.18 seconds.",
        "Referring further to FIG. 17, detector flag 603 is set to indicate a valid occurrence of the presence of a user's hand. A valid occurrence is defined as a variation in the value of stream Yd which is large enough and of long enough duration to be construed as an actual request for a towel to be dispensed. Detector flag 603 is set when output DF of detector low-pass filter 607 and output BLF of baseline low-pass filter 609 differ by more than a preset threshold number of counts T; a typical value for T is 100. This differencing step is shown at the summing junction of step 611 in FIG. 17, the output of which, as indicated, is DF-BLF. The comparison with threshold T is performed on the difference DF-BLF at step 613.",
        "This combination of detector and baseline digital low-pass filters 607 and 609 respectively serves as a \u201cpersistence filter\u201d 620 as described in FIGS. 17 and 18. The difference DF-BLF is shown as difference output 619, also a stream of values similar to Yd. The decision of step 613 is YES if DF-BLF (difference output 619) is greater than threshold T and NO if DF minus BLF is less than or equal to T. (Throughout the logical block diagrams shown herein, elements nnn of the block diagrams represent reference numbers of YES/NO decisions and are shown as having YES decisions nnnY and NO decisions nnnN.) YES decision 613Y triggers detector flag 603 to be set in step 615. NO decision 613N triggers detector flag 603 to be cleared in step 617.",
        "This combination of detector and baseline digital low-pass filters 607 and 609 respectively (persistence filter 620) has the following behavior: (1) Persistence filter 620 ignores very brief changes in stream Yd such that changes which are too brief are not considered to be valid towel dispense requests and (2) persistence filter 620 ignores extremely slow changes in stream Yd so that filter 620 adapts to variations in the environment in which sensor 337 resides, allowing proximity detector 49 to operate properly even with large shifts in the nominal capacitance of sensor 337 due to changes in, for example, the humidity of the surrounding environment.",
        "FIG. 18 is a representation of the approximate response of persistence filter 620 to an instantaneous change in stream Yd. The curve of FIG. 18 is an example of difference output 619. The horizontal dotted line along the middle of the graph represents threshold level T. Region 621 (i.e., the bold portion of the curve) of difference output 619 represents those values of difference output 619 which are above threshold T; such values indicate points in time at which divider output signal 577 is interpreted as detecting the presence of a user's hand resulting in setting of detector flag 603. In the embodiment, there may be a slight lag between the point at which the curve crosses the threshold T and commencement of region 621. The slight lag occurs because two computation cycles of persistence filter 620 occur after the instantaneous change in stream Yd and the second cycle does not occur until the beginning of region 621. Such lag is represented in FIG. 18 by the time delay between the point 622 at which difference output 619 crosses threshold T and the beginning 624 of bold portion 621.",

The steps required for the initialization of micro-controller 511 are well-known to those skilled in the art of programming firmware. Initialization step 625 also includes a detection by micro-controller 511 of the sheet length setting, in this embodiment, shown as 10, 12, or 14 inches. Initialization step 625 is followed by a step 626 during which control apparatus is set to a \u201cPower-up\u201d state 637 shown in FIG. 19C. followed by the step of logically entering a main loop 627.

The delay is realized through the use of a delay counter which is initialized as part of initialization 625 to a value corresponding to the number of passes through main loop 627 equivalent to the selected delay period. The period of delay may be set, for example, to one second; thus, for a main loop interrupt once every 5 milliseconds, the power-up counter would be set to 200 in step 625.",

In an embodiment, three rates are provided, herein indicated as \u201cslow,\u201d \u201cnormal,\u201d and \u201crapid.\u201d These rates are easily distinguishable by an operator, such as \u201cslow\u201d=once every 5 seconds, \u201cnormal\u201d=once every 2 seconds, and \u201crapid\u201d=once every one-half second.",
        "Returning to FIG. 19D, a decision 641 tests if Vs is less than a low-voltage threshold TL. Since micro-controller 511 is in \u201cReady\u201d state 631 and thus drive motor 267 is not powered, Vs is essentially a measurement of the unloaded voltage of the power supply. TL has a value such as 4.0 volts, a level of voltage indicating that the batteries are at the end of their useful life. If Vs is below TL (YES decision 641Y), the external LED 583 is set to blink at the \u201cslow\u201d blink rate in step 643. Micro-controller 511 is set to be in \u201cLosing-power\u201d state 635 (FIG. 20F) in step 645, and the controller returns to main loop 627 in step 639, awaiting the next interrupt signal which again triggers main loop 627.",

TH is set to a value such as 4.9 volts to indicate a level at which the batteries are near the end of their useful life. A YES decision 647Y therefore indicates that Vs is between TL and TH, and the micro-controller 511 then sets the external LED 583 to blink at the \u201crapid\u201d blink rate (step 651) indicating that the batteries may need to be replaced in the near future. A NO decision 647N indicates that the batteries have sufficient life remaining, and the external LED blink is therefore set to the \u201cnormal\u201d blink rate in step 649.",
        "Blink patterns and rates other than those described above may be employed. For example, LED 583 may be inactive in response to a NO decision at step 647, such inactive state indicating that the batteries are at a proper operating voltage. Indicators other than LED 583 may be used to provide the optional power source condition indication. For example, and as shown in FIG. 16E, LED 583 may be replaced with an audible sound emitter such as a magnetic buzzer 585 available from CUI, Inc., Beaverton, Oreg. as part number CEM-1205C.",
        "In an embodiment, micro-controller 511 next checks to determine whether an delay period between dispense cycles has been set and is active. Instructions residing in memory of micro-controller 511 may optionally include a delay feature imposing a delay of a predetermined time duration between dispense cycles to prevent continuous cycling of dispenser 10. If provided, such delay is initialized in step 683 of FIG. 19E at the end of a dispense cycle by the setting of a dispense delay counter in the set of instructions on micro-controller 511. The time duration of the delay period set in step 683 may be one second. The delay may be set in a fashion similar to the power-up counter. The dispense delay counter would be set to 200 in step 683 for a main loop interrupt once every 5 milliseconds.",

During each pass through the \u201cReady\u201d state portion of main loop 627 during which NO decision 653N is a result, the dispense delay counter is decremented (step 655) by one until the dispense delay counter=0. If the dispense delay counter equals zero (YES decision 653Y), the controller then checks to see if detector flag 603 is set (decision 657) indicating a valid request by a user for a towel to be dispensed.

The drive motor 267 is turned on at step 661, and a dispense sum is set in step 663 to a predetermined initial value which depends on the selected towel length. Micro-controller 511 is returned to main loop 627 in step 639 as described above. The dispense sum will be described in the explanation of \u201cDispensing\u201d state 633 which follows.",
        "FIG. 19E is a block diagram depicting the logic of the instructions executed in main loop 627 when the controller is in \u201cDispensing\u201d state 633. The general concept for control of \u201cDispensing\u201d state 633 is that an estimate of the inductive component of motor 267 voltage is used to determine a further estimate of drive roller 139 rotational velocity such that motor 267 is de-powered to enable the desired length of sheet material to be dispensed. The instructions on micro-controller 511 compensate for changes in power source 49 voltage, including fluctuations during dispensing and those which occur during the life cycle of a set of batteries (e.g., batteries such as batteries 271, 273) used to power dispenser 10.",
        "A series of further steps shown in FIG. 19E may be provided to compensate for coasting of the motor 267 which will occur after the motor 267 is de-powered. In general, the coasting steps provide mathematical operations resulting in the motor being de-powered slightly sooner if the estimate of motor RPM is above an inertia threshold T2. Inertia threshold T2 is an experimentally-determined value which correlates with a level of dispensing mechanism inertia useful for controlling the amount of coasting which will occur after motor de-powering. This simple determination with respect to inertia threshold T2 provides a crude estimate of inertia or angular momentum. The motor 267 is de-powered sooner because the inertia in dispensing mechanism 43 and motor 267 operating at an RPM level above inertia threshold T2 will result in coasting for a greater rotational distance than if the motor RPM is below inertia threshold T2.",
        "Within the circuit of 16D, power source voltage Vs is the sum of several individual voltage terms, including the voltage VR across the resistive portion of the motor armature impedance, voltage Vind across the inductive portion of the motor armature impedance, the voltage VFET across the motor drive transistor Q1, and the motor current-sensing voltage Vcurr across the current-sensing resistor R2. This sum is expressed as follows:\n\nVs=VR+Vind+VFET+Vcurr\n\nor can be expressed by solving for Vind:\n\nVind=Vs\u2212VR\u2212VFET\u2212Vcurr",
        "Since Vind is approximately proportional to the RPM of the motor, an estimate of Vind provides an estimate of motor RPM. The following approximation facilitates this estimation:\n\nVR+VFET+Vcurr\u22453\u00b7Vcurr\n\nresulting in the following relationship:\n\nVind\u2245Vs\u22123\u00b7Vcurr",
        "The estimate of Vind is defined as a dispense sum increment Q. As such, dispense sum increment Q is an instantaneous estimate of Vind, based on measurements of Vs and Vcurr. Both Vs and Vcurr are analog inputs to two analog-to-digital (A/D) lines at pins 8 and 10 respectively of micro-controller 511. Thus, Q is approximately proportional to motor 267 RPM, and a sum of a sequence of values for Q is approximately proportional to the length of sheet material dispensed. In the calculation of Q, indicated in step 667 in FIG. 19E, Q is constrained to be non-negative.",
        "Referring further to FIG. 19E, upon entering \u201cDispensing\u201d state 633, the external LED 583 is first set to blink at the normal rate. Next, in step 667, the instructions begin the estimating process by determining dispense sum increment Q as described above. In step 629, both Vs and Vcurr are measured by micro-controller 511 during each pass through main loop 627.",
        "In the embodiment described herein, the summing of dispense sum increments Q is accomplished by decrementing the predetermined initial value until the dispense sum drops below zero, at which point the dispense cycle is ended, thereby consistently controlling the sheet length as desired. For example, a representative target value for a 12-inch length of sheet material in the form of paper towel could be 120,000. A first dispense sum increment Q may be on the order of 100. Subtracting a value Q of 100 from target value 120,000 results in a dispense sum of 119,900. As the dispensing mechanism 43 accelerates and continues to operate, further sequential subtracting of each newly-determined dispense sum increment Q from the dispense sum results in attaining a zero value, typically in about 0.6 seconds, at which time micro-controller 511 de-powers motor 267. The values of Q resulting from measurements of Vs and Vcurr fluctuate widely as the motor 267 RPM changes during a dispense cycle and as the power source voltage changes.",
        "The instructions compensate for fluctuations in power source voltage Vs to provide consistency in the lengths of sheet material dispensed from dispenser 10. For example, battery voltage Vs will decrease over the life cycle of the batteries. As battery voltage Vs decreases, motor 267 is driven at lower RPM and thus the value of each dispense sum increment Q is decreased. As the value of dispense sum increments Q decrease, the number of operations required to reach the target value increases, and a relatively greater time duration is required to complete the calculation to reach the target value, thereby compensating for the voltage decrease by powering the motor 267 for an increased time duration.",
        "The remaining steps of dispensing state 633, including an optional coasting compensation feature, are now described with respect to the remainder of FIG. 19E. After the calculation of dispense sum increment Q in step 667, the dispense sum is tested in decision step 669 to see if it has been decreased below dispense sum threshold T1. If the result is NO decision 669N, the dispense sum is decremented by dispense sum increment Q. If the result is YES decision 669Y, then dispense sum increment Q is tested in decision step 673 to see if it is equal to or below inertia threshold T2. If the result of this test of Q (step 673) is NO decision 673N, the dispense sum is decremented by two times the dispense sum increment Q in step 675. If the result of this test of Q (step 673) is YES decision 673Y, the dispense sum is decremented by 0.75 times the dispense sum increment Q in step 677. The higher multiplying factor (e.g., 2 versus 0.75) means that motor 267 will be de-powered sooner since more coasting will occur after motor 267 is de-powered.",
        "As further explanation, for most of the period of time in which drive motor 267 is powered (dispensing towel), the dispense sum is reduced by dispense sum increment Q. When the dispense cycle approaches its completion as indicated by dispense sum threshold T1, dispense sum increment Q is tested against inertia threshold T2 as a quick estimate of the amount of coasting which will occur when drive motor 267 is turned off in step 681. Higher values of Q (above inertia threshold T2) trigger a faster decrementing of the dispense sum to turn off the motor a bit sooner than values of Q below inertia threshold T2.",
        "Following the decrementing of the dispense sum in steps 671, 675, or 677, the dispense sum is tested to see if it has been lowered below zero (step 679). If the result of decision step 679 is NO decision 679N, the controller 511 proceeds to step 639 which returns the controller to main loop 627, awaiting the next interrupt signal which again triggers main loop 627 with the dispensing cycle still underway (micro-controller 511 in \u201cDispensing\u201d state 633). If the result of decision step 679 is YES decision 679Y, drive motor 267 is turned off in step 681, the dispense delay counter is set to its initial value in step 683, the controller is set to \u201cReady\u201d state 631, and step 639 returns the controller to main loop 627, awaiting the next interrupt signal which again triggers main loop 627.",
        "In step 669, the dispense sum is calculated by sequentially decrementing the dispense sum increments Q from the current value of the dispense sum. Mathematically, the term \u201cdispense sum\u201d refers to the total accumulation of dispense sum increments Q. The verbs \u201csum\u201d or \u201csummed\u201d as used herein are defined as the process of mathematically accumulating the increments. The accumulation may consist of either sequential additions or subtractions (as is the case in the embodiment described above). For example, the dispense sum can also be determined by sequentially adding up the individual values of Q to reach a predetermined target value. Naturally, persons of skill in the art will appreciate that the important feature is the size of the accumulated dispense sum and not the specific numerical values associated with the initial and target values",
        "Irrespective of the form of the operation performed, the target value corresponding to each sheet length is a constant selected such that the accumulation of estimated dispense sum increments Q results in sheets of the proper length being dispensed.",
        "The coasting compensation feature described above is preferred but not required. If the optional coasting control is not used, decision step 669 is eliminated and every cycle through the dispensing state logic flows through step 671 such that dispense sum increment Q is subtracted from the dispense sum in each cycle through the logic. The dispenser 10 then proceeds through steps 679 through 685 as described above until the motor 267 is de-powered by the dispense sum reaching a target value in step 679. (In this example, the target value for the dispense sum is zero, with the dispense sum being decremented from an initial value representing requested towel length.)",
        "FIG. 19F is a block diagram depicting the logic of the instructions executed in main loop 627 when the controller is in \u201cLosing-power\u201d state 635. Since batteries are able to recover to some degree from low values of voltage Vs, the unloaded (motor de-powered) voltage of the batteries is tested (step 687) during each pass through main loop 627 while micro-controller 511 is in \u201cLosing-power\u201d state 635 to see if Vs has risen above TH, indicating that there is still useful life in the batteries. A NO decision 687N sets internal LED 581 to blink slowly and returns via step 639 to main loop 627. A YES decision 687Y results in external LED 583 to be set to normal blinking (step 691) and micro-controller 511 to be set to \u201cReady\u201d state 631 prior to being returned in step 639 to await the next interrupt to trigger main loop 627.",
        "Operation of exemplary automatic dispenser 10 and an exemplary method of dispensing will now be described. The method of dispensing will be adapted to the specific type of automatic dispenser apparatus utilized with the proximity detector.",
        "The first step of the dispensing method involves loading the dispenser with product to be dispensed. For the sheet material dispenser 10, such loading is accomplished with respect to dispenser 10 in the following manner. The dispenser cover 17 is initially opened causing roller frame assembly 173 to rotate outwardly about axially aligned pivot openings positioned in frame sidewall 53, 59, one of which is identified by reference number 189 (FIG. 8). The rotational movement of frame assembly 173 positions tension roller 141 and transfer assembly 227 away from drive roller 139 providing unobstructed access to housing interior 15 and space 75.",
        "When dispenser 10 is first placed in operation, a roll 41 of sheet material, such as paper toweling or tissue, may be placed on yoke 125 by spreading arms 131, 133 apart to locate the central portions of holders 135, 137 into roll core 117. The sheet material 111 is positioned over drive roller 139 in contact with drive roller segments 143-147. A roll could be stored on cradle 119 awaiting use. Further, cradle 119 could be removed to insert fresh batteries into battery box 311. Thereafter, cover 17 is closed as shown in FIG. 1. Movement of cover 17 to the closed position of FIG. 1 causes the leaf springs 213, 215 mounted on the roller frame assembly 173 to come in contact with the inside of cover 17 resiliently to urge the tension roller 141 into contact with sheet material 111 from roll 39 thereby ensuring frictional contact between the sheet material 111 and the drive roller 139 and, more particularly, drive roller segments 143-147. The dispenser 10 is now loaded and ready for operation.",
        "Subsequent steps involve the electrical components of the proximity detector and control apparatus 49, 50.",
        "At power up, the dispenser micro-controller 511 initializes (step 625) and loops through the \u201cPower Up\u201d and \u201cReady\u201d states 637, 631 and to the main loop 627 awaiting setting of a detector flag 603 upon recognition of a user by proximity detector 49. When a person approaches dispenser 10, the instructions proceed through the detection logic in the series of steps 601 resulting in setting of the detection flag in step 603. In \u201cReady\u201d state 631, the motor 267 is turned on in step 661. Rotation of drive roller 139 by motor 267 draws sheet material 111 through the nip 157 and out of the dispenser 10 through discharge opening 67.",
        "In the \u201cDispensing\u201d state 633, when the dispense sum reaches or drops below 0, the motor 267 is de-powered and any optional coasting of drive roller 139 results in dispensing of the desired length of sheet material to the user. Dispenser 10 returns to the main loop 639 and will not dispense again until the dispense delay counter=0 in step 653. The user may then separate sheet 111 into a discrete sheet by lifting sheet 111 up and into contact with tear bar 71 serrated edge 207, tearing the sheet 111.",
        "After repeated automatic dispensing cycles, cover 17 is removed to permit replenishment of the sheet material. At this time, a portion of stub roll 39 may remain and a reserve roll 41 of sheet material can be moved into position. As illustrated in FIG. 9, partially dispensed stub roll 39 (preferably having a diameter of about 2.75 inches or less) is now moved onto cradle 119 arcuate surfaces 121, 123. Sheet material 111 extending from stub roll 39 continues to pass over drive roller 139.",
        "After stub roll 39 is moved to the position in frame 13 shown in FIG. 9, a fresh reserve roll 41 can be loaded onto yoke 125. Sheet material 113 is then threaded onto the transfer assembly 227. More specifically, sheet material 113 is urged onto catch 256 which pierces through the sheet material 113. Sheet material 113 is further led under pins 259, 261 to hold sheet material 113 in place on the transfer assembly 227 as shown in FIG. 9. Transfer assembly surface 250 rests against sheet material 111. Surface 250 will ride along sheet material 111 without tearing or damaging material 111 as it is dispensed. The cover 17 is then closed to the position shown in FIG. 1.",
        "After further automatic dispensing cycles, sheet material 111 from stub roll 39 will be depleted. Upon passage of a final portion of sheet material 111 through nip 157, transfer surface 250 will come into direct contact with arcuate surface 257 of drive roller 139. Frictional engagement of drive roller segment 145 and surface 250 causes transfer assembly 227 to pivot rearwardly and slide up along slots 237, 239. Movement of transfer assembly 227 as described brings teeth 253 along arcuate surface 251 into engagement with drive roller segment 145. Engagement of teeth 253 with the frictional surface of segment 145 forcefully urges sheet material 113 held on catch 256 into contact with drive roller surface 257 causing sheet material 113 to be urged into nip 157 resulting in transfer to roll 41 as shown in FIG. 10. Following the transfer event, transfer assembly 227 falls back to the position shown in FIG. 10. Thereafter, sheet material 113 from roll 41 is dispensed until depleted or until such time as the sheet material rolls are replenished as described above.",
        "The invention is directed to automatic dispenser apparatus generally and is not limited to the specific automatic dispenser embodiment described above. For example, there is no requirement for the dispenser to dispense from plural rolls of sheet material, and there is no requirement for any transfer mechanism as described herein. The sheet material need not be in the form of a web wound into a roll as described above. The novel proximity detector 49 and control apparatus 50 will operate to control the dispensing mechanism 43 of virtually any type of automatic sheet material dispenser, including dispensers for paper towel, wipes and tissue.",
        "The novel proximity detector 49 will also operate with automatic dispensers other than sheet material dispensers. For example, the proximity detector will operate to control automatic personal care product dispensers, such as liquid soap dispensers. An automatic soap dispenser embodiment 10\u2032 is shown schematically in FIG. 20. In soap dispenser embodiment 10\u2032, the power supply apparatus 47, proximity detector 49 and control apparatus 50 components may be housed in an automatic soap dispenser apparatus housing 11. Dispensing mechanism 43 may be a solenoid or other mechanical actuator. An appropriate fluid reservoir 421 in communication with the solenoid or actuator (i.e., dispensing mechanism 43) is provided to hold the liquid soap. The solenoid or other actuator discharges soap from the dispenser through a fluid-discharge port. The detection zone 400 is generated below the soap dispenser adjacent the fluid-discharge port 423.",
        "Operation of the soap dispenser 10\u2032 may include steps/states 601 (including steps 577-603), 623, 625, 626, 627 together with \u201cPower up\u201d state 637, \u201cReady\u201d state 631, \u201cDispensing\u201d state 633, and \u201cLosing power\u201d state 635 and the corresponding apparatus described with respect to the dispenser 10. (Steps 667 through 679 would not be relevant for the soap dispenser.) In the soap dispenser embodiment 10\u2032, turning the motor on in step 661 is available to power the solenoid or other actuator in a manner identical to the manner in which the drive signal is generated in the dispenser embodiment 10. Powering of the solenoid or other actuator to dispense a unit volume of soap from the soap dispenser port 423 into the user's hand. The programmed instructions in micro-controller 511 will be tailored to the specific type of soap dispenser being used, for example to limit the number of dispensing cycles per detection event and to limit the dwell time between dispensing cycles.",
        "The dispenser apparatus may be made of any suitable material or combination of materials as stated above. Selection of the materials will be made based on many factors including, for example, specific purchaser requirements, price, aesthetics, the intended use of the dispenser, and the environment in which the dispenser will be used.",
        "While the principles of this invention have been described in connection with specific embodiments, it should be understood clearly that these descriptions are made only by way of example and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention."
